    "over the past few decades , increasing interest in biometrics has led to rapid improvements in biometric technologies @xcite .",
    "various biometric technologies are available for identifying or verifying an individual .",
    "face recognition , in particular , has attracted much attention due to its non - intrusive nature and important role in the areas of access control , security , video surveillance , and so on @xcite .",
    "however , face recognition is a very challenging task in practice due to great variations in facial appearance caused by pose , illumination , expression , etc .",
    "particularly , in real - world applications , face recognition often encounters the small sample size ( sss ) problem @xcite , where the training samples of subjects are very limited while the dimensionality of face data is high .",
    "a variety of face recognition algorithms have been developed so far @xcite . among them , the appearance - based methods are one of the well - studied techniques where a face is usually represented as a high - dimensional vector . to overcome the problems incurred by high dimensionality , subspace learning methods @xcite , which aim to find linear / non - linear mappings , are used to project the high - dimensional data onto the low - dimensional subspace .",
    "typical subspace learning methods include principal component analysis ( pca ) @xcite , linear discriminant analysis ( lda ) @xcite and related methods @xcite , locality preserving projections ( lpp ) @xcite , non - negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite , and class - dependence feature analysis ( cfa ) @xcite .    the projection axis obtained by the traditional subspace learning methods , such as pca , lda and lpp , is used to preserve the dominant data information or discriminate all the classes",
    ". one common problem of these methods is that they are not able to effectively discriminate classes close to each other since large class distances are often overemphasized during training .",
    "the resulting transformed subspace can preserve the distances of well - separated classes , while causing overlaps between neighboring classes .",
    "tao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a new criterion based on the maximization of the geometric mean of the divergences ( mgmd ) between different pairs of classes for subspace selection , which reduces the class separation problem .",
    "recently , nmf @xcite and its variants @xcite were developed as new subspace learning methods .",
    "based on the fact that many real - world data , such as images or videos , are non - negative , nmf - related methods force the non - negativity constraints in factorization .",
    "this non - negativity constraints are consistent with the psychological evidence of parts - based representations for human perception .",
    "however , the computational complexity of nmf - related methods is high for large training data .        compared with the above methods , the projection axis obtained by cfa",
    "is used to distinguish one specific class from the other classes ( see fig . [",
    "fig : example ] for an illustration ) .",
    "besides , the traditional methods @xcite often employ features derived from the space domain , while cfa uses features derived from the frequency domain @xcite . the key step in cfa is the design of the correlation filters .",
    "phase information which contains the structural information for human perception is directly modeled by the correlation filters in cfa @xcite .",
    "what is more , the correlation filters offer some desirable properties , such as graceful degradation , shift - invariance , and closed - form solutions @xcite .",
    "the original cfa @xcite designs the correlation filters by using the 2d fourier transforms of images . for simplicity , we call the original cfa as 2d - cfa . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "a tensor correlation filter based cfa method ( tcf - cfa ) , which generalizes the original cfa by encoding the image data as tensors , was proposed .",
    "it has been shown that tcf - cfa can be derived in a similar way as 2d - cfa , which is a special case of tcf - cfa when the image data are encoded as 2nd - order tensors ( i.e. , image matrices ) . moreover , the commonly - used correlation filters in tcf - cfa have the same form as those in 2d - cfa . in this study , we mainly focus on the 1d correlation filter based cfa ( 1d - cfa ) , since the previous research has demonstrated the great success by considering the image data as vectors @xcite and experimental results have already shown that 1d - cfa and 2d - cfa can achieve similar performance @xcite .",
    "there have been some widely - used correlation filters existing in the literature .",
    "for example , mahalanobis et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the minimum average correlation energy ( mace ) filter .",
    "the objective function of the mace filter is to minimize the average energy of the correlation plane outputs while satisfying the correlation peak amplitude constraints .",
    "the mace filter emphasizes high spatial frequencies to produce sharp correlation peaks , which makes it very sensitive to noise .",
    "kumar @xcite derived the minimum variance synthetic discriminant function ( mvsdf ) filter , which minimizes the correlation output noise variance while satisfying the correlation peak amplitude constraints .",
    "the mvsdf filter focuses on low spatial frequencies to reduce noise .",
    "otf ( optimal tradeoff filter ) @xcite combines the mace filter and the mvsdf filter to produce sharp correlation peaks and suppress noise .",
    "oeotf ( optimal extra - class output tradeoff filter ) @xcite was proposed to optimize the extra - class correlation outputs at the origin of the correlation plane . besides",
    ", the unconstrained correlation filters , such as the unconstrained otf filter ( uotf ) @xcite , are designed to maximize the average correlation height instead of enforcing the hard constraints on the outputs of correlation filters .",
    "the traditional correlation filters , such as mace @xcite , mvsdf @xcite , otf @xcite , and oeotf@xcite , assume that the distortion tolerance of a filter could be controlled by explicitly specifying desired correlation peak values for the training images .",
    "as a matter of fact , the overall performance becomes worse if one enforces the hard constraints on the correlation peak values during training .",
    "relaxing the hard constraints by using the unconstrained form could improve the overall performance for unseen patterns @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , experimental results on face recognition show that the direct use of uotf @xcite is not desirable for feature extraction .",
    "the reason is that the design criterion of uotf is not optimized for feature extraction in cfa .",
    "thus , it motivates us to design an effective unconstrained correlation filter which is in consistence with the feature extraction process of cfa .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel and effective unconstrained correlation filter , called unconstrained optimal origin tradeoff filter ( uootf ) , to extract the effective discriminative features in cfa .",
    "furthermore , to handle non - linearly separable distributions between different face classes , we also develop a nonlinear extension of uootf ( called kuootf ) based on the kernel technique @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , very few work concerns the design of unconstrained correlation filters in the cfa framework .    in summary ,",
    "the main contribution in this paper is a novel unconstrained correlation filter ( i.e. , uootf ) for effective feature extraction .",
    "uootf has three main advantages : 1 ) uootf overcomes the overfitting problem of the traditional uotf by emphasizing the origin correlation outputs ; 2 ) uootf provides a better generalization capability for unseen patterns by removing the hard constraints during the filter design ; 3 ) uootf can be easily extended to the kernel form ( i.e. , kuootf ) to deal with the non - linear structure of the class distribution .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the details of the proposed unconstrained correlation filter ( uootf ) are presented . in section 3 , we show how to extend uootf to its kernel form by using the kernel technique . in section 4 ,",
    "the proposed methods in the task of face recognition on several popular face databases are evaluated .",
    "finally , we provide some concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we begin with briefly introducing 1d - cfa @xcite in section 2.1 , since our method mainly focuses on the correlation filter design in the 1d - cfa framework .",
    "then , the proposed unconstrained correlation filter design is presented in section 2.2 . in section 2.3",
    ", we discuss the distinctions between different correlation filters .      compared with 2d - cfa where the correlation filters are designed in the two - dimensional image space ,",
    "1d - cfa not only achieves similar accuracy , but also has much lower computational complexity @xcite . during the training stage ,",
    "the 1d - cfa projection vectors ( i.e. , the correlation filters ) are generated and used for feature extraction .",
    "more specifically , face images are firstly represented as high - dimensional data ( e.g. the pixel intensities @xcite or gabor features @xcite ) .",
    "then , pca is used to perform dimensionality reduction . in the pca subspace ,",
    "the correlation filters are obtained by using the 1d fourier transforms of the low - dimensional features .",
    "finally , a bank of class - dependence correlation filters is trained for feature extraction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : framework ] .",
    "note that only the origin correlation outputs are used to form the feature in 1d - cfa .",
    "the traditional correlation filters @xcite in 1d - cfa are based on the assumption that the correlation peak amplitude should satisfy a specified value ( i.e. , the origin correlation outputs are restricted to @xmath0 for a specific class and 0 for the others ) .",
    "however , the overall performance of those filters can become worse for unseen patterns if the correlation peak values are constrained to some specified constant values during the filter design , which motivates us to design the filter in the unconstrained form .",
    "uotf is a traditional unconstrained correlation filter .",
    "the design criterion of uotf is to : ( i ) minimize the average energy and noise variance of the whole correlation plane for all the samples ; and ( ii ) maximize the origin correlation outputs for the intra - class samples .",
    "however , the minimization of ( i ) can not guarantee that the origin correlation outputs for the extra - class samples ( used to form the feature ) are minimal . as a result , although uotf @xcite tries to overcome the generalization problem by removing the hard constraints of otf , uotf fails in 1d - cfa ( see section 4 for the experimental results ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we propose to directly optimize the origin correlation outputs and take the extra - class samples and intra - class samples into respective considerations during the filter design .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the details of the proposed uootf . for the clarity of presentation ,",
    "vectors are denoted by an arrow on top of the alphabet .",
    "upper case symbols refer to quantities in the frequency plane terms while lower case symbols represent quantities in the space domain .",
    "1d - cfa designs a correlation filter for each class . let the filter trained for the @xmath1-th class be @xmath2 , and @xmath3 be the output of @xmath2 in response to @xmath4 .",
    "we have @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a correlation function ; @xmath4 is the low - dimensional pca feature for the @xmath7-th training image ; @xmath8 is the feature index in the spatial domain",
    ".    equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be expressed in the frequency domain by using the 1d fourier transform as follows : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the 1d fourier transforms of @xmath4 and @xmath2 , respectively ; @xmath12 is the reduced dimensionality of the pca subspace ; @xmath13 is the feature index in the frequency domain ; ` @xmath14 ' denotes the conjugate operator . according to ( [ eq:2 ] ) , the origin correlation output ( @xmath15 ) is the inner product of the input signal and the correlation filter in the frequency domain .",
    "the framework of the uootf design is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filterdesign ] . for the extra - class samples",
    ", uootf tries to balance the tradeoff between the origin correlation output energy and the origin correlation output noise variance .",
    "it can be derived by minimizing the weighted sum of the origin energy @xmath16 and the origin noise variance @xmath17 for the extra - class samples , which is expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 @xmath21 is the 1d fourier transform of the extra - class sample for the @xmath1-th class .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 , and @xmath24 @xmath21 is the 1d fourier transform of the extra - class noise sample for the @xmath1-th class ; @xmath25 is usually set as a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements represent the noise power spectral density ( in fact , @xmath25 can also be viewed as a regularization term ) ; ` @xmath26 ' represents the conjugate transpose ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 are the tradeoff parameters ; @xmath30 is the number of all the training samples and @xmath31 is the number of training samples for the @xmath1-th class ; @xmath32 denotes the number of extra - class training samples for the @xmath1-th class .    for the intra - class samples , we try to maximize the average origin correlation output , which is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the average of all the intra - class samples for the @xmath1-th class , and",

    ", we normalize the feature by using a simple strategy as follows : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 returns the maximum value in the vector @xmath44 ; @xmath45 is the normalized feature .    in algorithm 1",
    ", we give the outline of the proposed uootf based 1d - cfa for face recognition .",
    "it is worth comparing the performance obtained by different types of unconstrained correlation filters , which are designed based on various optimization criteria .",
    "the traditional unconstrained correlation filter , such as uotf , is designed based on the overall correlation output plane .",
    "nevertheless , such kind of filter design is not consistent with the feature extraction process , where only the origin correlation output is used in 1d - cfa .",
    "in contrast , during the design of uootf , the optimization criterion only focuses on the origin correlation output which is in essence more appropriate for feature extraction .",
    "[ fig : compare ] shows the normalized origin correlation outputs ( oco ) for uootf and uotf on a test face on the pie face database @xcite .",
    "we can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] that uootf can produce only one large amplitude peak value ( equal to @xmath0 ) for the relevant class while suppressing the peak values of the other irrelevant classes .",
    "on the contrary , uotf produces multiple large amplitude peak values ( close to @xmath0 ) for several classes due to overfitting .",
    "different from otf , uootf optimizes the correlation origin outputs for the extra - class samples .",
    "in addition , the solution of uootf is simpler and the output distortion tolerance is further enhanced by relaxing the constraints on the correlation peaks for the intra - class samples .",
    "however , we should point out that the proposed uootf requires more training time to obtain the closed - form solution compared with the other filters , such as uotf and otf .",
    "this is because the non - diagonal matrix inversion , which consumes the majority of the cpu time , is employed in uootf ( see ( [ eq:7 ] ) ) during the filter design .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by considering using gpu or parallel computation @xcite .",
    "in this section , uootf is designed in a high - dimensional feature space by using the kernel technique .",
    "the main idea of the kernel correlation filter is to find a non - linear projection by non - linearly mapping the data onto a feature space @xmath46 and then design the correlation filter there , thus implicitly yielding a non - linear filter in the input space @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath47 is the non - linear mapping .",
    "kernel uootf ( i.e. , kuootf ) tries to design the filter in @xmath46 so as to maximize the following objective function : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are the average correlation height , auto - covariance signal matrix and auto - covariance noise matrix in the feature space for the @xmath1-th class , respectively . to be specific , @xmath52    according to the theory of reproducing kernels @xcite",
    ", any solution @xmath53 must lie in the span of all the training samples in @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the solution can be expressed as @xmath54    based on ( [ eq:11 ] ) and the expression of @xmath55 in ( [ eq:10 ] ) , we have @xmath56 here we define @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the kernel function which only computes the inner product of two vectors in @xmath46 without ever mapping the data explicitly .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath59    using a similar transformation as ( [ eq:13 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath60 where@xmath61    as a result , maximizing ( [ eq:9 ] ) is equivalent to maximize @xmath62    the above problem can be solved analogously to ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "thus , the solution of ( [ eq:16 ] ) is @xmath63    the training stage of the kuootf based 1d - cfa is similar to the uootf based 1d - cfa except for the step of computing the feature matrix , which is given in algorithm 2 .    during the testing stage ,",

    "compared with er - kda and the kotf based 1d - cfa , the kuootf based 1d - cfa can achieve higher recognition rate by @xmath76 to @xmath77 on average .",
    "the kernel extension of uootf allows for higher flexibility of the decision boundary due to a wider range of non - linearity properties .",
    "it is worth noting that the overall recognition ability of the uootf based 1d - cfa is much better than the uotf based 1d - cfa in our experiments .",
    "the traditional uotf based 1d - cfa can not achieve satisfying recognition rates in face recognition because the design criterion in uotf is to optimize the whole correlation output plane which will lead to the overfitting problem in 1d - cfa ( i.e. , producing multiple large amplitude peak values ) . as a matter of fact , the feature extraction in 1d - cfa only considers the origin correlation outputs .",
    "therefore , the uootf based 1d - cfa enhances the discriminative ability of the features by allowing the flexible distortion tolerance .",
    "in this paper , we present an effective unconstrained correlation filter and apply it to the task of face recognition . by removing the hard constraints during the filter design and emphasizing the origin correlation outputs",
    ", uootf can extract discriminative face features very effectively for classification .",
    "furthermore , we derive the kernel extension of uootf to handle non - linearly separable distributions between different classes . experimental results on several public face databases",
    "show that the proposed uootf and kuootf methods achieve promising results in face recognition .",
