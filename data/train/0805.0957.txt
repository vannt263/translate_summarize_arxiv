    "recently , the mn - doped gaas system has received considerable attention in view of its potential use in spintronic technology , as it combines both semiconducting / semimetallic and ferromagnetic properties in one physical system @xcite .",
    "the positions of mn dopants play a decisive role in determining the magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as",
    ". there are three of them with a comparable energy @xcite .",
    "the substitutional mn atoms , mn@xmath0 , occupying ga sites , act as hole - producing acceptors which contribute to ferromagnetism .",
    "the mn atoms in tetrahedral interstitial positions , surrounded by either as or ga atoms , mn@xmath1 and mn@xmath2 , are electron - producing double donors which hinder ferromagnetic states .",
    "they partly compensate the mn acceptors in the substitutional positions and reduce the number of holes that mediate ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "post - growth annealing of ( ga , mn)as samples at low temperatures , close to the growth temperature , is known to improve magnetic properties of the ( ga , mn)as system @xcite . the concentration of mn interstitials is reduced via out - diffusion through the hexagonal interstitial sites towards a surface where they oxidize .",
    "a mn - rich oxide layer formed on the surface can be removed by etching @xcite .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectroscopy is the traditional tool which is used to characterize the local environment of impurities @xcite . not long ago a few works have been published reporting on computations of xanes at the mn k - edge in ternary ( ga , mn)as alloys @xcite and in related diluted magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "however , most of these xanes studies concern mainly substitutional mn defects . in the present paper a special attention",
    "is paid to interpretation of x - ray absorption spectra measured on mn - doped gaas materials in which different types of impurities coexist .",
    "let us note that recently detailed investigations focused on the configuration of substitutional and interstitial mn impurities in ( ga , mn)as have been performed with cross - sectional scanning tunneling microscopy ( xstm ) @xcite and electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr)@xcite .",
    "our study is based on the comparison of experimental xanes with spectra calculated by the method of full potential linearized augmented plane waves ( flapw ) @xcite .",
    "an isolated defect is represented by a supercell which should be as large as possible to describe correctly the absorption process .",
    "therefore , we simulate the spectra from different types of defects by separated calculations , considering always only one substitutional or interstitial atom in a supercell .    if we consider an isolated mn impurity , the position of the fermi energy on the energy scale depends on the defect type , i.e. , it is fixed by the acceptor level near the top of the valence band for the substitutional atom and by the donor levels close to the bottom of the conduction band for the interstitial atoms , respectively .",
    "the situation is similar in the supercell scheme with a single defect in each supercell .",
    "the concentration of defects is finite , the acceptor / donor levels are broadened and merge with the valence / conduction band , but the fermi energy remains fixed near the valence or conduction band , depending on the defect type .",
    "this complicates the quantitative analysis of experimental absorption spectra on the basis of the linear combination of theoretical spectra calculated separately for each impurity .    in the real crystal with a mixture of defects",
    "the position of the fermi energy is determined by the type of defects with the higher concentration , i.e. , in the ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as by concentration of acceptors .",
    "we model this situation by replacing the fermi energy of supercells with donors by the fermi energy of the supercell with an acceptor .",
    "this shift of the fermi energy must be respected in the linear combination of spectra fitting of the experimental data .",
    "the measurements have been carried out at the european synchrotron radiation facility in grenoble , beamline bm29 .",
    "the xanes spectra have been obtained by measuring the mn k@xmath3 fluorescence as a function of the energy of incident photons around the energy of the mn k absorption threshold , @xmath4  ev .    the measurements have been performed in the grazing - incidence mode , in which the penetration depth of the primary x - ray beam was sensitively tuned by changing the incidence angle @xmath5 of the primary radiation in the range from 0.1@xmath6 to 0.45@xmath6 , i.e. , around the critical angle @xmath7 of total external reflection . increasing the incidence angle in this range , the penetration depth grows from few nanometers to several microns .",
    "the fluorescence method of measurement was employed .",
    "the measured fluorescence signal comes from the transition of @xmath8 l - shell core - level electrons to @xmath9 k - shell core holes created by primary x - ray wave .",
    "the energy of the corresponding k@xmath3 fluorescence line is characteristic of the mn atom and its intensity is proportional to the absorption coefficient ( the xanes signal ) .",
    "spectra were measured at room temperature .",

    "after annealing , the content of mn was reduced to @xmath11 .",
    "the annealed sample was etched in @xmath12 hcl .",
    "manganese k - edge xanes spectra were taken in fluorescence from the 42  nm thick sample of the as - grown , annealed and etched - after - annialing ( ga , mn)as .    two sets of experimental mn k - edge xanes spectra , measured on the annealed and annealled - and - etched ( ga , mn)as samples , are presented in fig .",

    "the theoretical mn k - edge xanes spectra and electronic band structures of ( ga , mn)as were simulated using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave plus local orbitals ( flapw + lo ) method@xcite implemented by blaha et al . in the wien2k package @xcite .",
    "a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite was employed for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "basis wave functions were expanded in combinations of spherical harmonics inside non - overlapping muffin - tin ( mt ) spheres surrounding the atomic sites and in fourier series in the interstitial region , with a cutoff of r@xmath16k@xmath17 fixed at 7.0 , where r@xmath16 denotes the smallest mt sphere radius and k@xmath17 is the magnitude of the largest @xmath18-vector in the plane wave expansion .",

    "the spin - polarized calculations were performed within a 64-atom supercell based on the zinc - blende gaas cubic cell with the experimental lattice constant @xmath20  23 a , doped with 3.125/3.03 atomic percent of mn impurities in the substitutional / interstitial site .",

    "[ intro ] , the fermi level in ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as is determined by prevalence of acceptors , and situated in the band composed of the merged valence and broadened acceptor impurity band .",

    "as expected , the resulting fermi energies are shifted closer to the value obtained for the supercell with a single substitutional impurity .    in the single - electron approximation , which is used in our model ,",

    "the core - hole effect is known to be quite important for reproducing experimental spectra by theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we repeated our selfconsistent calculations also for excited states with one core electron removed from the mn @xmath9 level and an additional valence electron placed close to the bottom of the conduction band to fill the lowest unoccupied @xmath23 orbital .",

    "the intensity of pre - edge peaks is much larger for interstitials compared to that for the substitutional model spectrum . in accordance with wong @xcite , we attribute this difference to the different distance of the second neighbor shell ligands from the x - ray absorbing mn centers . as already mentioned in sec .",
