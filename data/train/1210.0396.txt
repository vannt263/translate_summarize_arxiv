    "at present various cosmological observations particularly sn ia [ 1 ] , cosmic microwave background radiation [ 2 ] and the large scale structure [ 3 , 4 ] have predicted that the universe is in accelerating phase only in recent past .",
    "these observed results are not in accord with the prediction of standard cosmology .",
    "so it is speculated that in addition to the normal cold dark matter the universe is dominated in recent times by an exotic matter ( known as dark energy ) with negative pressure and as a result we have the present accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "+ the possible choice of dark energy that first comes in mind is the cosmological constant ( i.e vacuum energy ) @xmath0 having equation of state @xmath1 .",
    "although this model in general agree with recent astronomical observations but it suffers from the well known cosmological constant problem [ 5 ] , coincidence problem [ 6 ] and age problem [ 7 ] .",
    "further , present data reveal that the choice of de should be such that there is a smooth transition across the phantom barrier from the above in near past [ 8 ] . during the last decade",
    "several models for de have been proposed namely , quintessence [ 9 ] , phantom [ 10 ] , k - essence [ 11 ] , tachyon [ 12 ] , quintom [ 8,13 ] , chaplygin gas [ 14 ] , holographic de [ 15 ] , the new age graphic de [ 16 ] , the ricci de [ 17 ] and so on . in this connection , it is worthwhile to mention that an alternative to incorporate the above mentioned cosmological observations in the framework of standard cosmology is to modify the gravity theory itself .",
    "for such extension to gravity one may refer to works namely in f(r ) theory [ 18 ] or theories with other curvature invariants [ 19 ] , coupling the ricci scalar to a scalar field [ 20 ] by introducing a vector field contribution [ 21 ] or by gravity thory in higher dimensional spacetimes [ 22 ] .",
    "+ now , among the several proposals for dark energy , hde models have got special attention both from theoretical as well as observational point of view . in this model the dark energy density is connected to the cosmic horizon which is a global property of the universe .",
    "also this model has a close relationship to the space - time foam [ 23 ] .",
    "further , the hde model greatly alleviates the coincidence problem and shows compatibility at 1@xmath2 confidence level with the age of old quasar apm 08279 + 5255 [ 24 ] .",
    "+ now starting with holographic principle and using effective quantum field theory , the energy density of hde model is related to the ir cut off length ( l ) . in literature , there are various choices of hde model , considering different system s ir cut off , for example ( i ) @xmath3 , the hubble radius , which can solve the coincidence problem as well as can drive accelerated expansion [ 25 ] , ( ii ) @xmath4 , the radius of the event horizon , which is used to obtain correct equation of state and the desired accelerating universe [ 26 ] ( iii ) @xmath5 , the ricci length , which corresponds to the size of the maximal perturbation leading to the formation of a black hole [ 27 ] , ( iv ) @xmath6 , which satisfies the restrictions imposed by the current observational data and avoids the causality problem ( as in the second case ) [ 28 ] . in the present work we consider couplings in the dark sector species .",
    "this is in part motivated by the fact that until today we can only extract information of these components through gravitational interaction .",
    "these interacting models were first proposed by wetterich [ 29 ] to low - down the value of the cosmological term and subsequently , it was found to resolve the cosmic coincidence problem [ 30 ] . at first , in section ii , the interacting two fluid system is shown to be equivalent to a single dark fluid and then late time solutions for two different choices of @xmath7 have been presented . in section iii , we show that the above equivalent single dark fluid may be identified as the modified chaplygin gas model .",
    "the equivalence between hde model and a scalar field has been presented in section iv , for various scalar field models namely , quintessence , tachyonic , k - essence and dilatonic .",
    "finally at the end , in section v , there is a short summary of the whole work .",
    "we consider the homogeneous and isotropic model of the universe having the line element    @xmath8\\ ] ]     + with @xmath9 for flat , closed and open model of the universe , a(t ) is the scale factor and @xmath10 + however , the recent observations [ 2 , 3 , 31 ] are compatible with a closed universe with a small positive curvature , i.e. , @xmath11 . as we are dealing with present cosmological epoch , so neglecting the contributions from baryonic matter and radiation [ 28 ] , the first friedmann equation becomes    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the energy density of dm ( assuming in dust form ) and @xmath14 is the energy density for de which is chosen as perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath16 is no longer a constant and @xmath17 is the thermodynamic pressure for de .",
    "the energy conservation relations for these two dark components are given by    @xmath18    and    @xmath19     + where the overdot represents the differentiation with respect to the cosmic time and the interaction term @xmath20 indicates an energy flow from de to dm .",
    "note that @xmath21 indicates a transfer of energy in the opposite direction ( i.e. , from dm to de ) and we shall omit this situation due to its contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics [ 32 ] and this view is also supported by observations [ 33 ] .",
    "+ we consider interactions that are linear combinations of the dark sector densities as [ 34 ]    @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are dimensionless constants . as from observational point of view",
    "the interaction should be subdominant today , so @xmath25 and @xmath26 are very small ( i.e. , @xmath25 @xmath27 1 and @xmath26 @xmath27 1 ) .",
    "the factor h in the above expression for interaction is motivated purely from mathematical ground .",
    "this general form of interaction has been studied recently by quartin et al [ 34 ] and the particular cases @xmath28 and @xmath29 were considered in [ 35 ] and [ 36 ] respectively . + now substituting this form of interaction , i.e. , equation ( 5 ) in the energy conservation equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we have    @xmath30    and    @xmath31    where @xmath32 . +",
    "this shows that we have effectively non - interacting two fluid system , both have the same energy densities as before , only pressure changes .",
    "if we define @xmath33 , as the total energy density , then its evolution equation can be obtained from the the conservation relations [ i.e. , equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) or equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ] as    @xmath34    i.e. ,   @xmath35 + with    @xmath36    here @xmath37 is the equation of state parameter for the combined single fluid and @xmath38 is the density parameter for the dark energy which is related to the density parameters for dark matter ( @xmath39 ) and curvature ( @xmath40 ) by the relation    @xmath41     + one may note that even if @xmath7 , the equation of state parameter for dark energy is chosen to be constant , @xmath37 is still a variable , i.e. , the effective one fluid model has always varying equation of state . also as @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so , @xmath45 ; i.e. , the effective single fluid is always of de nature",
    ". therefore , interacting two fluid system - one in the form of dark matter ( dust ) and other in the form of dark energy ( perfect fluid ) is equivalent to a single dark fluid with variable equation of state ( @xmath46 ) .",

    "+ we shall now examine whether mcg can be considered as a unified single fluid model of dm and hde with various values of ir cut off lengths .",
    "the interaction is chosen in simple form as : @xmath120 [ i.e. , @xmath23= 0 and @xmath86 , in equation ( 5 ) ] + the ir cut off lengths(l ) for hde are chosen as the four possibilities used in the literature namely ( i ) hubble radius , i.e. , @xmath3 , ( ii ) radius of the event horizon , i.e. , @xmath4 , ( iii ) ricci length scale , i.e. , @xmath121 and ( iv ) @xmath122 now using the effective quantum field theory and the holographic principle , the energy density for hde can be written as [ 15 ] + @xmath123    where , @xmath124 is a dimensionless quantity that carries the uncertainties of the theory and is usually assumed to be constant while the factor 3 is introduced for convenience . +      here ,    @xmath125    for flat frw model the ratio of the energy densities turns out to be constant , i.e. , @xmath126 + thus the coincidence problem can be alleviated .",

    "+      the equation of the state parameter for hde is given by    @xmath138    with @xmath139 as the energy density for hde .",

    "so , at present , when de dominates over normal matter , it is reasonable to chose pressure to be negative and as a result we have    @xmath145 .",
    "thus the above cubic equation has one positive real root for x , i.e. , @xmath146 and hence in principle the combined one fluid system can be effectively considered as mcg model .",

    "ii , the interacting dark components are shown to be equivalent to a single dark fluid with variable equation of state and exact analytic solutions are evaluated both for constant and variable equation of state ( @xmath7 ) for de .",
    "these solutions describe the late time evolution of the universe .",
    "in fact , the solution with @xmath7= constant , represents the evolution of the universe just after the matter dominated era to quintessence/ @xmath0cdm/ phantom domain depending on the choice of a coupling parameter in the interaction term .",
    "so there is a smooth transition from deceleration to present accelerating phase . on the otherhand ,",
    "the solution with variable @xmath7 describes the evolution of the universe from matter dominated era and the asymptotic future is same for the previous solution .",
    "further , in both the solutions dm dominates first and then gradually de has the leading role in the evolution of the universe [ see figure 1(a ) , 1(b ) and 2(a ) ] .",
    "subsequently , we have examined whether this effective single fluid may be equivalent to the mcg model .",
    "we have found that a part of the evolution of the universe can be described by this equivalent model .",
    "then we have tried to identify mcg as interacting hde model .",
    "we have considered all four possible choices for ir cut off length for hde model and have shown that in principle all the four models may be matched to mcg with some restrictions in the parameters involved in some cases .",
    "then we have made an attempt to have a correspondence between hde model with different scalar field models namely , ( i ) quintessence , ( ii ) tachyon , ( iii ) k - essence and ( iv ) dilaton .",
    "it is found that for hde model with event horizon as the ir cut off , no correspondence is possible with k - essence scalar field .",
    "however , in all other cases hde model is shown to be equivalent to all the scalar field models mentioned above .",
    "further , to have a correspondence with k - essence scalar field , the hde model with ricci length scale as the ir cut off , the density parameter @xmath147 is restricted to the interval ( @xmath223 , @xmath224 ) [ see equation ( 65 ) ] .",
    "so , if we take the recent observed value of @xmath147 to be 0.72 [ 43 ] , c may be estimated as c @xmath225 0.6 , which also agrees with recent observed value of c. also in case of dilatonic scalar field it is possible to have scaling solution with scalar field varies as logarithm of cosmic time .",
    "in all the cases due to complicated form of the expressions involved , it is not possible to express the potential v(@xmath164 ) explicitly as a function of the scalar field , rather both @xmath164 and v(@xmath164 ) are expressed with @xmath147 or scale factor a as the parameter .",
    "therefore we conclude that an interacting de model or a hde model consists of two fluids is always equivalent to a single de fluid and may be considered as a scalar field or mcg model .",

    "<S> dark energy models have got tremendous enthusiasm recently both from theoretical and observational point of view . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the universe at present is dominated by dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) which do not evolve separately but interact non - gravitationally with one another and are equivalent to a single dark fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we construct explicit solutions for two choices of the equation of state parameter for de and results are analyzed both graphically as well as analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) model is shown to be compatible with this effective single dark fluid as well as different interacting holographic dark energy ( hde ) models characterized by various ir cut off lengths . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we establish the equivalence between hde with different scalar field models . </S>",
