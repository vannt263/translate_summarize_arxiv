    "galaxies in the universe have a wide range of physical properties such as morphology , spectra , mass , and so on .",
    "one of the major goals of the extragalactic astronomy is to understand what determines such properties of galaxies , and the first step toward the goal is to understand exactly how different the various galaxies are . one efficient way to comprehend the nature of the diverse galaxies is to classify them using some criteria and to compare their statistical properties between the classes . in many previous studies , however , galaxies have been classified using simple schemes based on just one or two properties , which sometimes miss detailed aspects of galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , several unusual classes of galaxies such as blue early - type galaxies @xcite and passive spiral galaxies @xcite , or the fundamental parameter difference between finely - divided classes in the same morphology class @xcite are difficult to investigate using simple classification schemes .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i and paper ii , respectively ) presented studies on the optical and multi - wavelength properties of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) galaxies divided into fine classes based on their morphology , colour and spectral features .",
    "those finely - classified sdss galaxies show distinguishable differences from each other in their photometric ( both optical and multi - wavelength ) and structural properties , which are hardly found in the studies using simple classification schemes .",
    "based on the understanding of the basic properties of the various galaxy classes presented in paper i and paper ii , now it is needed to approach the next question : what makes them have such diverse natures ?    for a long time , the environments of galaxies have been regarded as important factors determining the nature of galaxies . since close galaxies have influence on each other directly or indirectly , the local density about a galaxy is closely related to the properties of that galaxy @xcite .",
    "environments in which galaxies have many chances to interact with each other , induce morphology transformation by the tidal interaction or merging of galaxies @xcite .",
    "such galaxy interactions convert the properties of galaxies , by triggering star formation @xcite or by suppressing star formation with tidal gas stripping @xcite .",
    "moreover , the complete merging of two or more galaxies is a classical candidate of the early - type galaxy formation mechanism @xcite .",
    "in addition to the direct interaction between galaxies , dense environments affect galaxies with their strong gravitational potential @xcite . since large amount of hot gas is concentrated in high - density environments ( e.g. galaxy clusters ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the morphology transformation of galaxies happens in such environments by the _ ram pressure stripping _",
    "@xcite .    due to the close relationships between environments and galaxy properties ,",
    "many studies have been focused on the environmental effects in galaxy evolution .",
    "@xcite inspected the environmental dependence of optical properties of the sdss galaxies , finding that the colour is the most sensitive parameter to the local density , and that the other parameters are not sensitive to environments when the colour and luminosity are fixed .",
    "@xcite found that the surface brightness profile type and axis ratio of galaxies are frequently correlated with the local density .",
    "@xcite showed that the age , metallicity and @xmath0-element enhancement of galaxies are affected by the environments of galaxies .",
    "@xcite argued that galaxy evolution is accelerated in dense environments , which took place mainly at high redshifts , based on the age  density relations with respect to galaxy luminosity or mass .",
    "@xcite investigated the star formation history of early - type galaxies , showing that a significant number of galaxies in high - density environments undergo low but detectable recent star formation .",
    "@xcite inspected the environmental dependence of starburst galaxies , finding that the starburst in a galaxy is triggered when its nearby ( within 20 kpc ) neighbour has similar luminosity or mass .",
    "@xcite presented that most agn host galaxies are closer to the red sequence than the blue sequence , but they prefer lower density environments than red sequence galaxies .",
    "@xcite inspected the environmental dependence of physical properties of the sdss galaxies , based on the local density estimated using an adaptive smoothing kernel , showing that variations of galaxy properties are almost entirely due to the environmental dependence of morphology and luminosity , and that other properties are almost independent of local density , when morphology and luminosity are fixed .",
    "@xcite found that the role of satellite galaxies in the transformation from blue sequence galaxies to red sequence galaxies is important , in the sense that the satellite galaxies may quench the star formation of their host galaxies . @xcite",
    "and @xcite showed that the morphology of a galaxy depends sensitively on the distance and morphology of its nearest neighbour galaxy , and that galaxy properties in the general field do not directly depend much on the large - scale background density .",
    "they showed that the apparent dependence of galaxy properties on the background density environment can be largely explained by an accumulated result of the interactions between the nearest neighbour galaxies .",
    "since it is obvious that environments affect galaxy properties significantly , environments must have played an important role in determining the fine classes ( i.e. morphology , colour , and spectral features ) of galaxies as well .",
    "thus , to understand the origin of the various fine galaxy classes , it is needed to compare their environments .",

    "such variation is mainly due to the differences in the internal properties between the fine classes , but some galaxies show multi - wavelength properties that are not easy to understand just by their intrinsic characteristics , such as optically passive but x - ray bright galaxies .",

    "practically , however , the distance estimation for distant galaxies has very large uncertainty compared to the determination of the 2d coordinates on the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight , due to the intrinsic limit of the distance estimation .",
    "the distances to galaxies are typically measured by means of determining the recession velocities of galaxies caused by the cosmological expansion .",
    "however , it has a problem that the recession velocity of a galaxy is given by both the cosmological expansion and the peculiar motion of that galaxy .",
    "the velocity dispersions of typical rich galaxy clusters range from 500 km s@xmath45 to 2000 km s@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "suppose that a galaxy cluster at z @xmath48 has velocity dispersion of 1000 km s@xmath45 .",
    "in that cluster , 32 per cent of its member galaxies have relative velocities larger than 1000 km s@xmath45 , compared to the dynamical centre of the cluster , which results in redshift difference larger than 0.003 .",
    "if we estimate the distance to the member galaxies with ignoring the peculiar velocity effect , the 0.003 redshift difference is interpreted as the distance difference of 13 mpc .",
    "since the typical diameter scale of galaxy clusters is at most a few mpc , this causes significant underestimation of the 3d local number density in rich galaxy clusters . on the other hand , since such a peculiar velocity effect is very small in the low density fields , the 3d local density is more accurate than the 2d local density in low - density environments .",
    "[ 2d3d ] compares between the 2d and 3d local density indicators , showing a clear trend that the 3d local density is smaller than the 2d local density at high - density environments , while the 3d local density is larger than the 2d local density at low - density environments .",
    "the difference between the 2d and 3d densities tends to increase as the redshift interval in estimating the 2d local density increases .",
    "we adopted a spline smoothing kernel when estimating the local density , because it is centrally weighted unlike the uniform kernel and because it has a finite size unlike the gaussian kernel .",
    "the basic functional form of the spline kernel is described well in @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the spline kernel is defined as : @xmath51 where @xmath49 is the distance from the target object and @xmath50 is the kernel size .",
    "@xmath52 is a constant , which has the value of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the 2d and 3d local density estimation , respectively .",
    "[ kernel ] shows the shape of the spline kernel used in this paper .              as a local density indicator ,",
    "the local galaxy number density is quite useful but has some weakness at the same time .",
    "that is , in the local number density estimation , both five faint blue galaxies and five bright red galaxies are commonly counted as _ five galaxies _ , which is missing the luminosity and colour information of the counted galaxies .",
    "the luminosity dispersion problem can be minimised by limiting the luminosity of the counted galaxies to a narrow range @xcite .",
    "however , another way to reflect both the luminosity and colour information of the galaxies in the local environments is to estimate the local luminosity density and the local colour .",
    "it should be reminded that the local luminosity density is not the same as the local mass density @xcite , because galaxies with the same mass may have quite different luminosity according to their mass - to - light ratio .",
    "thus , both the local number density and the local luminosity density need to be compared for more reliable environmental analysis .",
    "[ basic]a shows the distribution of the local galaxy number density ( @xmath55 ) divided by the mean number density in our sample , @xmath56 mpc@xmath57 .",
    "[ basic]b and fig .",
    "[ basic]c are the same as fig .",
    "[ basic]a , but for the local luminosity density ( @xmath58 ) and the local colour ( @xmath59 ) , respectively .",
    "when the larger @xmath60 value of the kernel size @xmath61 is adopted , the distributions of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath59 become shallower , showing that a large kernel tends to smooth out the variations of small - scale environments . since the main interest of this paper is the local environments that affect directly the properties of galaxies rather than the large - scale structure , we focus on the small - scale environments by adopting the @xmath64 kernel . fig .  [",
    "basic]d and [ basic2]d display the local number density versus the local luminosity density in the 2d and 3d estimation , showing tight correlations with the ordinary least - squares bisector @xcite fit : @xmath65 @xmath66 with @xmath58-direction rms of 0.33 and 0.35 absolute - mag mpc@xmath57 , respectively .",
    "that is , the local luminosity density reflects well the local number density overall , but there are typically @xmath58 dispersions of @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) mag mpc@xmath57 at fixed @xmath55 in the 2d ( 3d ) estimation .",
    "the local luminosity density and the local colour provide additional information that the local number density does not show .",
    "however , there is one issue we should consider : @xmath58 and @xmath59 include the information of the target galaxy itself . in the local number density , this is not a significant problem , because the target galaxy itself is always counted as simply _",
    "one galaxy _ , which affects the zeropoint of the environmental parameter but does not cause any systematic distortion . on the other hand , this may cause a significant distortion for the local luminosity density and the local colour , because target galaxies have their own luminosity and colour ranging widely .",
    "suppose a target galaxy and its several neighbour galaxies and we calculate the local luminosity density and the local colour for the target galaxy .",
    "after that , we replace the target galaxy with a new one with quite different luminosity and colour .",
    "then , the new local luminosity density and local colour may be different from the old values .",
    "however , the local environment has not changed actually , but it is only the target galaxy that changed .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to exclude the information of the target galaxy itself when estimating the local luminosity density and the local colour , to investigate the environmental effects on the target galaxy . the local number or mass density used by @xcite and @xcite excluded the contribution of the target galaxy itself .",
    "[ prime ] and [ prime2 ] compare the original environmental parameters ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) and the target - excluded environmental parameters ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "@xmath40 is systematically fainter than @xmath58 ( because only four galaxies are used in the luminosity summation , rather than five ) , but still correlated with @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ prime]a and [ prime2]a ) . in fig .",
    "[ prime]b , d , f and [ prime2]b , d , f , it seems that @xmath58 and @xmath59 strongly depend on the luminosity and colour of the target galaxy .",
    "however , such dependency becomes very weak when the @xmath58 and @xmath59 are replaced by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the target - excluded environmental parameters , as shown in fig .",
    "[ prime]c , e , g and [ prime2]c , e , g . after excluding the information of the target galaxy , the environmental parameters have correlations with the target luminosity and colour , as follows : @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 which show relatively weak dependence on the local environments , compared to the target - included local density indicators ."
