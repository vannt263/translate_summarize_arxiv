    "in recent years , the subject of invisibility physics has attracted a great and renewed interest , mainly triggered by the publication of a few seminal papers by pendry and leonhardt on transformation optics and electromagnetic cloaking @xcite , which has lead to the first experimental observation of invisibility at microwave frequencies @xcite . since then , a large body of works inspired by the concepts of transformation optics has been published , and applications to matter wave cloaking have been suggested as well @xcite . an invisible object or scatter is , by definition , an object which does not scatter any wave incident upon it ; that is , a wave which shines on the object is not reflected or absorbed , but instead it is transmitted in such a way that it appears to the outside observer as if there were no object present . the concepts and methods of invisibility based on the idea of transformation optics apply to two- or three - dimensional objects .",
    "in one - dimensional systems , the possibility to achieve an invisible scatter is closely related to the realization of reflectionless potentials . for continuous media ,",
    "this problem was investigated in a pioneering work by kay and moses in 1956 @xcite , and then studied in great detail in the context of the inverse scattering theory @xcite and supersymmetric quantum mechanics for hermitian systems @xcite .",
    "the potentials obtained by such techniques , though being transparent , are generally not invisible .",
    "this is due to the dependence of the phase of the transmitted wave on energy , which is generally responsible for some delay and/or for the distortion of a wave packet transmitted across the potential @xcite .",
    "+ the possibility of synthesizing reflectionless potentials has been also investigated for wave scattering on a lattice , in which wave transport occurs due to hopping among adjacent sites of the lattice . in the mathematical literature , this problem is solved by the inverse spectral theory of jacobi operators , i.e. , second order symmetric difference operators @xcite ; in this context , darboux transformations and the intertwining operator technique of supersymmetric quantum mechanics have been successfully extended to the discrete schrdinger equation , with applications to the synthesis of transparent ( i.e. reflectionless ) defects in hermitian tight - binding lattices @xcite .",
    "an optical realization of a special class of these reflectionless potentials on a lattice has been recently proposed for waveguide arrays and coupled - resonator structures with modulated coupling rates @xcite , suggesting new possibilities for pulse and beam shaping . for hermitian lattices ,",
    "such reflectionless potentials are nevertheless not invisible because the bound states of the lattice modify the time - of - flight of a wave packet and generally also distorts its shape : the existence of defects in the lattice , though being transparent , could be then inferred form simple time - of - flight measurements . + it is the aim of this work to show that fully invisibility of localized defects can be realized in _ non - hermitian _ tight - binding lattices , which are synthesized by iterated application of the intertwining operator technique ( darboux transformation ) to a defect - free tight - binding hermitian lattice .",
    "the study of non - hermitian tight - binding lattices has received in recent years a great attention ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) ; such previous studies have been mainly focused to lattices possessing parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry and were framed in the context of non - hermitian quantum mechanics @xcite , however the possibility to realize invisibility in a non - hermitian lattice was not investigated in such previous works @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the class of non - hermtian lattices synthesized in the present work by application of the darboux transformation and showing the property of invisibility are not @xmath0-symmetric . nevertheless , their energy spectrum is real - valued because they are isospectral to an hermitian lattice .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 symmetry does not play any role in the realization of invisible defects discussed in this work .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in secs.ii and iii ,",
    "the intertwining operator technique and its application to the synthesis of tight - binding lattices with reflectionless defects are briefly reviewed .",
    "the scattering and invisibility properties of the synthesized lattices are discussed in section iv ; in particular , it is shown that , as for any hermitian lattice invisibility can never be achieved and time - of - flight measurements can be used to reveal the existence of defects in the lattice , in non - hermitian lattices with certain complex hopping rates invisibility can occur .",
    "the main conclusions are outlined in sec.v , whereas some mathematical details and a possible realization of non - hermitian lattice models based on light propagation in optical waveguide arrays are presented in three appendixes .",
    "the synthesis of reflectionless and invisible defects in a tight - binding lattice discussed in the next sections is based on the discrete analogs of the intertwining operator technique of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "extensions of the intertwining operator technique to the discrete schrdinger equation , together with the related issue of inverse scattering for jacobi operators , have been discussed mainly in the mathematical literature ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , however they are not so common in the physical contexts . in this section",
    "we thus provide a brief review of the intertwining operator technique and its application to the problem of spectral engineering of tight - binding lattices .",
    "+ let us consider a one - dimensional tight - binding lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a wannier state localized at site @xmath3 of the lattice , @xmath4 is the hopping rate between sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the energy of wannier state @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath9 turns out to be hermitian provided that the hopping amplitudes @xmath4 and site energies @xmath7 are real - valued parameters .",
    "let us indicate by @xmath10 the tight - binding hamiltonian defined by eq.(1 ) with hopping amplitudes and site energies given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and let us assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath15 , i.e. that the lattice is asymptotically homogeneous and free of defects .",
    "let @xmath16 be the spectrum of @xmath10 , which comprises the continuous spectrum @xmath17 ( the tight - binding band @xmath18 ) and the point spectrum @xmath19 .",
    "our goal is to synthesize a new tight - binding lattice hamiltonian @xmath20 of the form of eq.(1 ) , whose spectrum @xmath21 is the same as that of @xmath10 , except for the addition of a new real - valued energy level @xmath22 in the point spectrum , with @xmath23 . to this aim ,",
    "let us indicate by @xmath24 a solution to the second - order difference equation @xmath25 with the asymptotic behavior @xmath26 for @xmath15 .",
    "note that such a solution does exist because @xmath22 does not belong to the point spectrum nor to the continuous spectrum of @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath27 is given by an arbitrary superposition of two linearly - independent solutions to eq.(2 ) , which behave asymptotically as @xmath28 at @xmath29 for @xmath30 , or as @xmath31 at @xmath15 for @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the root of the equation @xmath34 .",
    "it can be then shown by direct calculations that the following factorization for @xmath10 holds @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 let us then introduce the new hamiltonian @xmath20 obtained from @xmath10 by interchanging the operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 , i.e. let us set @xmath40 @xmath20 will be referred to as the partner hamiltonian of @xmath10 . using eqs.(4 - 9 ) , from e.(10 ) it can be readily shown that @xmath20 describes the hamiltonian of a tight - binding lattice [ i.e. , it is of the form ( 1 ) ] with hopping amplitudes and site energies @xmath41 given by @xmath42 note that , owing to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath11 , @xmath43 and @xmath27 at @xmath44 , one has @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath44 , i.e. the partner lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath20 is still a homogeneous lattice without defects at @xmath44 . an interesting property of the hamiltonian @xmath20 is that its spectrum @xmath21 is given by @xmath47 , i.e. it is the same as that of @xmath10 plus the additional energy level @xmath22 in the point spectrum .",
    "in fact , let us indicate by @xmath48 a proper ( or improper ) eigenfunction of @xmath10 with energy @xmath49 .",
    "note that , if @xmath49 belongs to the point spectrum of @xmath10 , @xmath50 as @xmath51 , whereas if @xmath49 belongs to the continuous spectrum of @xmath10 , @xmath52 remains bounded as @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath22 does not belong to the point spectrum of @xmath10 , one has @xmath53 . using the factorization ( 3 ) for @xmath10",
    ", the eigenvalue equation @xmath54 reads explicitly @xmath55 from which it follows that @xmath56 since @xmath57 . applying the operator @xmath38 to both sides of eq.(13 ) , one obtains @xmath58 i.e. @xmath59 , where we have set @xmath60 therefore , @xmath61 is an eigenfunction of @xmath20 corresponding to the energy @xmath49 .",
    "also , from eqs.(6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 15 ) and from the assumed asymptotic behavior of @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath44 , it follows that @xmath64 is a proper ( improper ) eigenfunction of @xmath20 in the same way as @xmath65 is a proper ( improper ) eigenfunction of @xmath10 . in a similar way",
    ", one can show that any eigenvalue @xmath49 of @xmath20 , belonging to its continuous or to its point spectrum , is also an eigenvalue of @xmath10 provided that @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the continuous and point spectra of @xmath10 and @xmath20 do coincide , apart from the energy level @xmath67 which needs a separate analysis .",
    "for @xmath67 , the eigenvalue equation @xmath68 can be satisfied by taking @xmath69 , which reads explicitly @xmath70 using the expressions of @xmath71 and @xmath72 given by eqs.(6 - 9 ) , the difference equation ( 16 ) for @xmath73 can be solved in a closed form , yielding @xmath74 in view of the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath27 and @xmath4 as @xmath15 and assuming that @xmath27 does not vanish for any integer @xmath3 , it turns out that @xmath73 is bounded and @xmath75 as @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath67 belongs to the point spectrum of @xmath20 and its eigenfunction is given by eq.(17 ) .",
    "+ it should be noted that the synthesis of the partner hamiltonian @xmath20 , with spectrum @xmath76 , is not unique because of some freedom left in the choice of @xmath27 satisfying eq.(2 ) once @xmath22 has been fixed : different choices of @xmath27 lead in fact to different lattice realizations of @xmath20 , i.e. different values of hopping amplitudes @xmath77 and site energies @xmath78 .",
    "the factorization method can be iterated to synthesize new hamiltonians @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , ... whose energy spectra differ from that of @xmath10 owing to the addition of the discrete energy levels @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , ... , with @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "+ an interesting property , that is proven in the appendix a , is the following one .",
    "let us assume @xmath87 for the lattice hamiltonian @xmath10 .",
    "then a partner hamiltonian @xmath88 , obtained from @xmath10 by adding @xmath89 new energy levels @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , .... , @xmath93 , can be synthesized in such a way that @xmath94 .",
    "this means that the partner lattice described by @xmath88 and supporting @xmath89 bound states differs from the original one , defined by @xmath10 , because of different hopping rates @xmath4 between adjacent sites , but not for the site energies @xmath7 .",
    "+ as a final note , it should be mentioned that the technique of intertwining operators so far described could generate non - hermitian lattice hamiltonians with complex - valued hopping rates @xmath4 or site energies @xmath7 , even though the initial hamiltonian @xmath10 is hermitian .",
    "however , in spite of non - hermiticity , the energy spectrum of such synthesized hamiltonians remains by construction real - valued .",
    "this situation is especially interesting for the synthesis of invisible defects in the lattice , as discussed in sec.iv .",
    "the intertwining operator technique presented in the previous section can be applied to the synthesis of lattices with reflectionless defects .",
    "previous works have so far limited to consider hermitian lattices ( see , for instance , @xcite ) ; conversely , here we do not necessarily require that the partner hamiltonians @xmath20 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , ... , obtained by the iterated application of intertwining operator method , be self - adjoint .",
    "notably , it will be shown in the next section that a truly invisibility of the defects requires the synthesis of non - hermitian lattices . in this section ,",
    "we first discuss the scattering properties of partner lattice hamiltonians obtained by the intertwining operator technique , and then apply the results to the synthesis of reflectionless defects in the lattices .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath20 be the hamiltonians of the two partner tight - binding lattices defined by eqs.(3 ) and ( 10 ) . by construction ,",
    "the two hamiltonians have the same energy spectrum , except for an additional energy level @xmath22 for @xmath20 .",
    "the two lattices are homogeneous ( i.e. , free of defects ) at @xmath29 ; therefore , asymptotically they admit of plane - wave solutions of the form @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the wave number that varies in the interval @xmath97 .",
    "such plane waves belong to the common continuous spectrum of the hamiltonians , with energy @xmath98 . the reflection ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) and transmission ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) coefficients of the two lattices",
    "are defined by the asymptotic behavior of scattered waves at @xmath15 from a forward - incident plane wave @xmath103 according to the relations @xcite @xmath104 for @xmath10 , and @xmath105 for @xmath20 .",
    "let us indicate by @xmath106 the real - valued and positive solution to the equation @xmath107 and let @xmath108 ( i.e. @xmath109 for @xmath110 , @xmath111 for @xmath112 ) .",
    "it can be then proven that the following relations between transmission and reflection coefficients of the two partner hamiltonians hold @xmath113 the proof of eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) is given in the appendix b. here we just noticed that @xmath114 and @xmath115 , i.e. the transmittance and reflectance coefficients of the two partner lattices are the same . it should be noted that , as @xmath116 for the hermitian @xmath10 lattice , it follows that @xmath117 either , even if the partner hamiltonian @xmath20 is non - hermitian .",
    "this result is a non - trivial one because it is known that unitarity of the scattering matrix in a generic non - hermitian hamiltonian is usually broken , and the reflection and transmission coefficients can be unbounded ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
