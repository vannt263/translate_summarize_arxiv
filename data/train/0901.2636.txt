    "the form factors of heavy - to - light transitions at large and intermediate energies are among the most important applications of qcd light - cone sum rule ( lcsr ) , since the validity of the lcsr approach is restricted to the large meson energy ( @xmath15 ) via the relation @xmath16 . in literature there are several approaches to calculate the @xmath17 transition form factors in addition to the qcd lcsr approach , such as the lattice qcd technique and the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach .",
    "these approaches are complementary to each other , since they are adaptable in different energy regions , and by combining the results from these three methods , one may obtain a full understanding of the @xmath18 transition form factors in its whole physical region @xcite . since the lcsr is restricted to small and moderate @xmath19 , a better lcsr shall present a better connection to both the pqcd and the lattice qcd results , and then a better understanding of these form factors .",
    "how to  design \" a proper correlator for these heavy - to - light form factors is a tricky problem .",
    "if the correlator is chosen properly , one can simplify the lcsr greatly .",
    "as for the @xmath20 light pseudoscalar mesons , the commonly adopted correlators are usually defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand for the light quark fields that form the pseudo - scalar mesons . by taking such conventional correlation functions , it has been found that the main uncertainties in estimation of the @xmath1 form factors come from the different twist structures of pion / kaon wave functions , and most importantly , the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions should be treated on the equal footing @xcite .",
    "thus one has to calculate both the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions up to one - loop accuracy in order to obtain a consistent one - loop estimation of the form factors .    on the other hand , by taking proper chiral currents into the correlator , one can directly eliminate the most uncertain twist-3 terms , and then only needs to calculate the twist-2 contribution to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy @xcite . at the present , the vector form factors @xmath25 has been calculated with the chiral current in the lcsr up to nlo @xcite .",
    "it can be found that the scalar and penguin form factors @xmath26 shall be important in due cases , e.g. the penguin form factors shall give sizable contributions to @xmath27 or @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to extend the previous study to all the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 stands @xmath3 , @xmath4 and all light pseudoscalar mesons ) transition form factors @xmath29 with the chiral current in the lcsr up to one - loop accuracy .",
    "furthermore , it maybe also interesting to know to what degree the different choices of correlator shall affect the final lcsrs , which is another purpose of present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the calculation technology to obtain the lcsrs for the @xmath1 transition form factors @xmath30 with chiral currents , where the @xmath14-breaking effects for the kaonic case will be explained in due places . numerical results and discussions",
    "are presented in sec .",

    "sec.v is reserved for a summary .",
    "based on the previous calculation about the transition form factor @xmath32 , we present the formulae for the @xmath1 transition form factors for generality such that these formulae can also be conveniently extended for other light pseudo - scalar form factors like @xmath33 and @xmath34 form factors . with default , we adopt the chiral limit @xmath35 , but point out how to include the @xmath14-breaking effects for the @xmath36 form factors in due places , i.e. the dominant @xmath14-breaking effects will be discussed with the newly obtained @xmath4 meson distribution amplitudes @xcite .",

    "and then , we present the newly obtained results for the scalar and tensor form factors .      the vacuum - to - meson matrix elements in terms of the pseudo - scalar s lc das of different twist can be expanded by contracting the @xmath8-quark fields with the help of the full @xmath8-quark propagator within the background field : @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where only the free propagator and the one - gluon terms are retained , @xmath54 stands for the background gluonic field strength , and @xmath55 denotes the strong coupling constant .",

    "these differences , especially in the larger @xmath19 region are mainly caused by the treatment of the twist-3 contribution and by the different treatment of the uncertainty .",
    "the twist-3 contribution can affect the shape of the form factors .",

    "this difference is caused by the fact that we adopt the pion and kaon das derived from their wave functions to do our discussion , whose parameters are determined by the combined effects of @xmath206 and @xmath207 ; while in ref.@xcite , @xmath206 and @xmath207 are varied independently and then their contributions are changed separately .      refs.@xcite has argued to used @xmath105 @xmath8-quark mass instead of the pole quark mass .",
    "the @xmath105 @xmath8-quark running mass ( @xmath247 ) is related to the one - loop @xmath8-quark pole mass ( @xmath248 ) through the following well - known relation : @xmath249 with the help of the relation ( [ relat ] ) , one can conveniently transform the form factor expressions among these two choices of @xmath8-quark mass .",
    "and one only need to be careful to use all the parameters calculated under the same choice , e.g. the value of @xmath250 should be calculated by using the same currents in the correlator and under the same choice of @xmath8-quark mass . by calculating the ordinary correlators ( [ cc1],[cc2 ] ) up to nlo and by varying the @xmath105 @xmath8-quark mass within the region of @xmath251 gev ,",
