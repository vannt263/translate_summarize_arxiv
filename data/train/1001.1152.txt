    "an electromagnetic wave in a straight wave guide can not accelerate particles because its phase velocity @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 . in conventional linear accelerators ,",
    "@xmath0 is reduced by a chain of resonant cavities along the guide .",
    "a scheme not using a resonance phenomenon is the travelling wave tube ( twt ) .",
    "one type of twt is a cylindrical tube with a conducting helical wire inside @xcite .",
    "another type is a tube with a thick dielectric wall @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study another kind of helical device  : the helically bent tube .",
    "the main `` photon path '' is the helix passing trough the centres of the local cross sections of the tube . for a strong enough bending ,",
    "the difference in length between this path and a straight path is such that the effective @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath1 , although the local @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "one may expect several advantages in using helically bent tube in place of accelerating cavities  : easy construction , easy cooling , easy maintainance of the wall surface using an helical arm , large frequency spacing of the modes , large group velocity which allow a fast filling of the guide by the wave .",
    "alternatively , the wave can be generated by a driving beam . like with the dielectric wall in @xcite , several modes can cooperate to transfer the energy from one beam to the other .",
    "the helical wave guide is defined by its axis @xmath2 , its period @xmath3 and the _ base curve _ , which is the section of the wall with the @xmath4 plane , of parametric equation @xmath5 .",
    "the point @xmath6 is supposed to be inside the base .",
    "the wall surface is generated by helices @xmath7 of parametric equation [ param ] ( x , y , z)=(r[qz]_b(s),z ) where the @xmath8 matrix @xmath9 $ ] describes the rotation of angle @xmath10 about @xmath11 .",
    "one method to make a helical waveguide is to draw helical grooves on the internal face of an initially cylindral tube .",
    "the case of rectangular grooves has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wall base curves have indentations . here",
    "we will restrict to base curves with smooth curvatures .",
    "this work is the continuation of a first study @xcite , where the electromagnetic wave modes were calculated using a partial wave expansion ( pwe ) associated to a point matching ( pm ) method .",
    "since that time , we realized that pwe is limited to weak enough helical bending and sufficiently `` round '' base curves  ; if it is not the case , the pwe converges only inside a cylinder which does not contain the whole guide .    in this paper",
    "we will recall the pwe - pm method , some of our old results , present some new ones and discuss the limitations of this method .",
    "two alternative methods will be evoked .",
    "we first present the simpler case of a scalar field @xmath12 , which obeys the klein - gordon equation ( in units @xmath13 ) [ scalar ] ( -^2_t+ ^2_x+ ^2_y+ ^2_z ) ( t , x , y , z)=0 , with the boundary condition @xmath14 on the wall .",

    "the two expressions of ( [ bessel ] ) are equivalent .",

    "the choice of @xmath41 s and @xmath37 should be guided by the following conditions  :    * the @xmath41 s should give a precise enough definition of the base curve , * @xmath37 should contain @xmath21 s of both signs , however with more @xmath21 s of the same sign as @xmath42 .",
