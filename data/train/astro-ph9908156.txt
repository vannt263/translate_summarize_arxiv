    "in driebe et al . ( 1998 ) ( hereafter referred to as paper i ) we presented a grid of evolutionary tracks for low - mass white dwarfs with helium cores ( he - wds ) in the mass range from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . the lower masses allow applications to companions of millisecond pulsars .",
    "as an example we derived a cooling age for the he - wd companion of the millisecond pulsar psr j1012 + 5307 of @xmath6 gyr , which is in good agreement with the pulsar s spin - down age of @xmath7 gyr .",
    "the evolutionary tracks are based on a @xmath8 model sequence extending from the pre - main sequence stage through the red - giant branch ( rgb ) domain .",
    "we forced the models to move off the giant branch and to evolve into the white dwarf regime by applying large mass - loss rates at appropriate positions to take into account the binary nature of he - wds ( for details see paper i ) .",
    "as pointed out in paper i one of the major results of our study was the dominant contribution of hydrogen burning to the luminosity budget of the he - wds .",
    "therefore the final cooling evolution is slowed down , and the derived cooling ages are notably larger than those found in models which do not consider nuclear burning or do not find hydrogen burning to be important due to much lower envelope masses .    in the present paper",
    "we will discuss the evolution of sequences which undergo hydrogen shell flashes in detail .",
    "it is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ instburn ] we will briefly summarize the main reasons for unstable nuclear burning , and report in sect .",
    "[ insthe ] on former studies concerning instabilities in he - wds . in sect .",
    "[ calc ] we describe the evolutionary code used for our calculations .",
    "the main results of the calculations are discussed in sects . [ over ] to [ roche ] . finally , conclusions are given in sect .",
    "there are two reasons for nuclear burning to become unstable : the first one is the decoupling of the thermal and mechanical structure of a star due to large electron degeneracy .",
    "if the equation of state gets more and more independent of the temperature a local increase in energy production can not be stabilized by a local expansion with following cooling of the affected layers .",
    "therefore a further increase in energy production will lead to a corresponding increase in temperature which in turn will again raise the energy release .",
    "this phase of thermally unstable burning will continue until the ongoing temperature increase results in an effective lifting of degeneracy in the burning zone .",
    "the stronger coupling of thermal and mechanical structure will then allow for an expansion and the transition to a phase of stable nuclear burning .",
    "this kind of instability is found , for instance , during the onset of central helium burning in low - mass stars ( @xmath9 for @xmath10 ) on the tip of the red giant branch ( central helium flash ) .",
    "the second reason for thermally unstable nuclear burning is mostly based on the geometry of the burning region and occurs only during shell burning .",
    "if the shell s mass ( its  thickness  ) becomes too small compared to its radial extent , the expansion following a local increase in temperature and energy production is insufficient to cool the shell : the thin burning zone will instead be heated by expansion , and the energy production is further increased .",
    "the thermal runaway only stops when the thickness of the shell is large enough as to allow for a cooling expansion .",
    "this kind of unstable burning repeatedly takes place during the double shell - burning phase of agb stars ( schwarzschild & hrm 1965 , weigert 1966 ) .",
    "there , these instabilities are known as thermal pulses or helium shell flashes caused by thermally unstable helium burning .",
    "schwarzschild & hrm ( 1965 ) derived an instability criterion for non - degenerate matter by linear perturbation analysis .",
    "this criterion includes the shell thickness as well as the temperature exponent @xmath11 of the energy generation rate ( @xmath12 ) as a measure of the temperature dependence of nuclear burning .",
    "the assumption of non - degeneracy is justified for the helium layers of agb models during most of the thermal pulse evolution . according to the schwarzschild & hrm criterion unstable burning",
    "is favored when the shell becomes thinner and the burning is quite temperature sensitive , as it is the case for helium burning .",
    "a similar criterion for the study of thermal pulses was derived by sackmann ( 1977 ) . in a recent study frost et al .",
    "( 1998 ) report that in advanced stages of thermal pulse evolution degeneracy in the region of the helium burning shell may become noticeable and can therefore lead to significantly stronger pulses ( degenerate pulses ) .",
    "kippenhahn & weigert ( 1990 ) give an instability criterion which also takes degeneracy into account .",
    "unlike as in agb stars , where the helium burning shell becomes thermally unstable , he - wds show instabilities related to cno cycling which dominates hydrogen burning in the lower , i.e. hotter part of the geometrically thin shell .",
    "kippenhahn et al . (",
    "1967 ) calculated a he - wd model with @xmath13 which evolves through a phase of unstable burning . as a result",
    "the track in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) is reversed and the he - wd returns to the rgb domain .",
    "the evolution of the white dwarf during the thermal instability was followed in more detail by kippenhahn et al .",
    "giannone et al .",
    "( 1970 ) found unstable burning in a @xmath14 he - wd model , whereas their models with @xmath15 and @xmath16 did not show any sign of thermal instabilities . unlike the previously mentioned studies , webbink ( 1975 ) found only small hook - like excursions in his he - wd tracks close to the point of maximum effective temperature .",
    "iben & tutukov ( 1986 ) calculated a @xmath17 he - wd model based on a @xmath18 model which suffered from high mass loss episodes on the rgb , mimicking roche - lobe overflow to a companion .",
    "they found two strong thermal instabilities to occur on the cooling branch resulting in a track similar to the one of kippenhahn et al .",

    "castellani et al .",
    "( 1994 ) calculated a grid of he - wd model sequences for different metallicities @xmath19 using the same technique as iben & tutukov ( 1986 ) . like giannone et al .",
    "( 1970 ) they found thermal instabilities only below a certain mass limit wich depends on @xmath19 : for @xmath20 and 0.001 no flashes were found for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . for @xmath23",
    "one hydrogen shell flash was found for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in a recent study sarna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found instabilities in their cooling tracks for @xmath26 , quite similar to those of webbink ( 1975 ) who , however , used rather large time steps .",
    "due to large time steps and/or significantly smaller envelope masses several studies did not find thermal instabilities at all during the cooling of he - wds , as e.  g.   chin & stothers ( 1971 ) , alberts et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , althaus & benvenuto ( 1997 ) , benvenuto & althaus ( 1998 ) and hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) .",
    "besides some minor modifications we used the evolutionary code described by blcker ( @xcite ) .",
    "nuclear burning is accounted for via a nucleosynthesis network including 30 isotopes with all important reactions up to carbon burning similar as in el eid ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent radiative opacities by iglesias et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and iglesias & rogers ( @xcite ) , supplemented by those of alexander & ferguson ( @xcite ) in the low - temperature region , are employed . diffusion is not considered .",
    "the initial composition is @xmath27 , the mixing length parameter @xmath28 followed from calibrating a solar model .",
    "the coulomb corrections to the equation of state are those given by slattery et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "he - wds are known to be components in binary systems where early case b mass transfer ( kippenhahn & weigert 1967 ) must have taken place during rgb evolution which forces the stars to leave the rgb before the onset of helium burning and to evolve into the white dwarf regime .",
    "we did not calculate the mass exchange phases during the rgb evolution in detail because we are primarily interested in the cooling properties of the white dwarf models themselves rather than in the generation of these models by binary star evolution .",
    "hence we used an approximate approach to get the pre - white dwarf models ( see also iben & tutukov 1986 , castellani et al .",
    "1994 , and paper i ) :    = 8.6 cm    we calculated a 1  @xmath29 sequence from the pre - main sequence phase up to the tip of the rgb . along the rgb we applied mass - loss rates @xmath30 according to reimers ( @xcite ) with @xmath31 . at appropriate positions high mass loss rates , @xmath32 , were invoked in order to get models of desired final mass , @xmath33 : 0.179 , 0.195 , 0.234 , 0.259 , 0.300 , 0.331 and @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ oldpic1 ] displays all he - wd sequences in the hrd .",
    "high mass loss varied from @xmath35 for @xmath36 to about @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "these values were chosen to allow the models to hold thermal equilibrium during their further evolution ( with @xmath39 ) . for a more detailed description",
    "we refer to paper i. here , we only want to stress the importance of sufficiently small time steps when the evolution through thermal instabilities should be followed properly . a brief discussion on this topic is given in the appendix .",
    "we briefly repeat the main results of our calculations which have been addressed in detail in paper i. due to the comparatively large remaining envelope masses after termination of the rgb evolution    .[tab1 ] total remnant mass @xmath40 , mass of the hydrogen - exhausted core @xmath41 , total mass of the outer hydrogen layers (  thickness  ) @xmath42 , envelope mass @xmath43 , and helium surface abundance by mass fraction @xmath44 , at @xmath45  k for @xmath46 and at 10000 k for @xmath47 after the end of rgb evolution .",
    "@xmath41 is defined by the mass coordinate below which @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the mass fraction of hydrogen . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,>,>,^ \" , ]     after mass loss terminates the rgb evolution , the remnants evolve at almost constant surface luminosity to higher effective temperatures towards the white dwarf cooling branch . in this phase",
    "the total luminosity is almost entirely supplied by nuclear burning due to cno cycling ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the contribution due to contraction is negligible .",
    "the situation changes when the star reaches the cooling branch .",
    "now , the temperature within the hydrogen burning shell becomes too low to support further cno cycling .",
    "@xmath51 drops significantly , and contraction sets in until pp - burning takes over the main nuclear energy production .",
    "still @xmath52 holds in this early cooling period ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ lt0259 ] and fig .  5 in paper i ) .",
    "the phase of unstable burning starts at typical effective temperatures of @xmath53 on the cooling branch ( close to point a in fig .",
    "[ pic3 ] ) . at this stage of evolution",
    "the energy production due to cno cycling rises again and finally exceeds the pp - contribution by large amounts . in fig .",
    "[ pic3 ] this part roughly coincides with the loop between point a and b in the hrd .",
    "the duration for this period of evolution ( @xmath54 ) depends on the remaining envelope mass and the thermal timescale of the burning shell , and ranges from @xmath55 for @xmath56 to @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "for example , the model with @xmath59 gives @xmath60 , that with @xmath61 only @xmath62 . at the onset of the second flash for @xmath63 one",
    "gets @xmath64 due to the further reduced envelope mass .",
    "the increasing energy release during the flash development causes a steep temperature gradient in the vicinity of maximum energy production and the formation of a pulse - driven convection zone well inside the hydrogen burning shell ( beyond point b ) .",
    "the situation is displayed in fig .",
    "[ pic5 ] :    at @xmath65 the convective shell establishes right above the locus of maximum energy production due to hydrogen burning .",
    "the degeneracy inside the burning shell is quite moderate as can be seen from the degeneracy parameter @xmath66 at maximum energy generation ( for the defintion of @xmath66 see e.g. kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) . during the onset of the unstable burning , @xmath67 .",
    "once the convection zone is fully established , the evolution is rapidly accelerated ( roughly between point b and d ) .",
    "the typical time scale is now of the order of a few decades .",
    "the luminosity contribution due to nuclear burning increases several orders of magnitude and the convection zone grows until it extends to the stellar surface ( see fig .",
    "[ pic5 ] , @xmath68 ) .",
    "although @xmath69 increases to about @xmath1 in this phase ( near point c in fig .",
    "[ pic3 ] ) , the surface luminosity drops by almost 2 orders of magnitude because the increased energy production is largely overcompensated by the energy loss due to the expansion of the envelope .",
    "this expansion roughly doubles the stellar radius and leads to a complete lifting of degeneracy in the shell ( sharp drop of @xmath66 ) .",
    "for instance , model b has @xmath70 , and beyond point c one finds @xmath71 .",
    "the maximum hydrogen luminosity reached during the flash is supplied by pp - burning , although the onset of the instability is triggered by cno cycling ( see below , fig .",
    "[ pic2a ] ) . for @xmath59 , @xmath72 . for @xmath63",
    "both flashes are of comparable strength with @xmath73 for the first and @xmath74 for the second flash .",
    "the time span between both flashes amounts to @xmath75 ( see also fig . [ pic2a ] ) .    beyond point c the most luminous part of the flash instability has passed and @xmath69 decreases while @xmath76 increases .",
    "the surface luminosity is again enhanced due to the increase of @xmath76 . at point d ( @xmath77 ,",
    "[ pic3 ] ) the upper boundary of the pulse - driven convection zone reaches the surface ( at @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ pic5 ] ) . due to the convective transport of hydrogen from the surface layers down to the hydrogen burning region the surface hydrogen abundance",
    "is reduced by about @xmath2 when surface convection establishes .",
    "the small blueward evolution in the evolutionary track close to point d is related to these composition changes in the envelope ( see iben & tutukov 1986 ) .",
    "the compositional change is consistent with the results of the flash model of kippenhahn et al .",
    "( 1968 ) who found @xmath79 .",

    "finally , contraction seizes the surface layers and the star evolves back to higher effective temperatures towards the cooling branch again .    around point f just before re - entering the cooling branch , the so - called subflashes develop . here , contraction initiates another small increase of @xmath69 to @xmath83 ( compared to @xmath84 during the major flash ) leading to a temporary expansion of the outer layers of the star and only minor circle - like excursions in the hrd .    for illustration , fig .",

    "the peak at @xmath86 which is not resolved within the plot range comes from the major flash , the second peak at @xmath87 with @xmath88 followed by a short period with @xmath89 , i.e. expansion , marks the subflash .",

    "as previously mentioned the instability in he - wds is caused by the fading cno - luminosity on the cooling branch around @xmath98 .",

    "the peaks in @xmath69 ( @xmath105 ) are due to pp - burning .    to investigate the dependence of the mass on the occurrence of hydrogen flashes we applied the criteria for unstable burning discussed in sect .",
    "[ instburn ] . as already seen in fig .",
    "[ pic5 ] the degeneracy in the hydrogen shell is quite moderate but far from being negligible .",
    "we used the criterion of kippenhahn & weigert ( 1990 ) to account for the possible effect of degeneracy .",
    "the criterion states that nuclear burning in a shell at radius @xmath106 and of thickness @xmath107 becomes unstable if @xmath108 @xmath109 is the adiabatic temperature gradient and @xmath110 and @xmath111 are given by @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for comparison",
    ", we also used the criterion of schwarzschild & hrm ( 1965 ) which predicts unstable burning if @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 being the temperature difference between lower und upper shell boundary . a main problem",

    "= 8.8 cm = 10.8 cm    however , although we find the instability criterions to be fulfilled in several models the strict application of the aforementioned criteria alone can not explain the restricted mass range for the occurrence of hydrogen flashes . some general aspects on the model properties important for the study of unstable burning can be seen from fig .",
    "[ pic6 ] where different quantities of layers at maximum energy generation are shown along the cooling branch evolution for the non - flash sequences with @xmath117 and @xmath118 and the flash sequence with @xmath59 covering most of the he - wd mass range .",
    "as seen before for @xmath63 , degeneracy of the shell layers is moderate ( lower left panel ) in the upper part of the cooling branch evolution . for @xmath119 at the beginning of unstable burning ( @xmath120 ) . for @xmath121 degeneracy",

    "does not depend on @xmath66 in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "] thus , inspecting eq .",
    "( [ kipcrit ] ) , from @xmath66 alone we would conclude that , if at all , degeneracy favours hydrogen shell flashes for lower he - wd masses .",
    "the temperature sensitivity of nuclear burning along the cooling branch can be seen from the quantity @xmath133 which is shown in the lower right panel of fig . [ pic6 ] .",
    "when the flash develops for @xmath59 , one finds @xmath134 .",
    "for the other masses we have @xmath135 ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath136 ( @xmath124 ) . because unstable nuclear burning",
    "is favoured for higher temperature sensitivity of the burning ( see eq .",
    "( [ schcrit ] ) ) the occurrence of flashes is favoured for heavier white dwarfs .",
    "thus , combining the effects of degeneracy and large temperature exponents in the energy generation rate might , in principle , explain why high and low - mass he - wds do not suffer from hydrogen flashes .",
    "however , it is most likely the radial thickness of the shell ( see upper right panel in fig .",
    "[ pic6 ] ) which has the most important effect on the occurrence of hydrogen flashes . at the onset of unstable burning we found @xmath137 for @xmath59 ( the shell s borders",
    "are taken at the point with @xmath138 ) . for @xmath124",
    ", @xmath107 is approximately a factor of two larger and for @xmath121 a factor of two smaller",
    ". for low - mass he - wds degeneracy of the shell is of minor importance .",
    "also , the thickness of the shell is too large as to allow hydrogen shell flashes . on the other hand , for high - mass he - wds the shell is so thin that the thermal cooling time is smaller than the typical time scale for the onset of the instability",
    "hence , for he - wds with @xmath139 an instability might be initiated but the fast cooling of the shell prevents a hydrogen flash ( see also next section ) .      after the he - wd models with @xmath63 and @xmath140 have completed their major hydrogen flashes a final onset of a flash results in a local hook in the cooling track ( see figs .",
    "[ pic2 ] and [ pic3 ] , point g ) .",
    "again this increase of luminosity due to hydrogen burning is caused by cno cycling .",
    "this can be seen from figs .",

    "the corresponding point for @xmath59 is at an age of @xmath144 , which is about @xmath145 after the major flash . at this point of evolution hydrogen shell burning",
    "is already dominated by pp - burning ( @xmath146 ) , but the difference between both contributions is rather small compared to the later evolution ( see figs .",
    "[ lt0234 ] and [ lt0259 ] for @xmath147 gyr ) . because the characteristic cooling time is now smaller than the typical timescale for the onset of unstable burning another strong hydrogen flash is prevented .",
    "such onsets of unstable cno - burning have also been found in the sequences with @xmath148 and @xmath149 , resulting in similar hooks on the cooling track ( see fig .  1 in paper i ) .    the further evolution in both flash sequences is comparable to the one without hydrogen flashes ( see for instance fig .  4 in paper i ) .",
    "it is characterized by quiescent hydrogen shell burning via the pp - chains until an age of about 10 gyr .",
    "then hydrogen burning terminates and contraction determines the surface luminosity evolution and final cooling ( see figs .",
    "[ lt0234 ] and [ lt0259 ] ) .",
    "finally , we like to note that the mass - radius - relation of he - wds is only affected by hydrogen shell flashes for @xmath150 : the high burning rates associated with the flashes lead to a higher envelope consumption compared to sequences without flashes , resulting in slightly smaller radii and enhanced evolutionary speeds on the upper part of the cooling branch .",
    "besides , since the timescale of the instabilities is short compared to the characteristic cooling time ( a few @xmath151 compared to gyr ) and most of the time during a flash is spent close to the cooling branch , the influence of hydrogen shell flashes on the mass - radius - relation is restricted to the onset phase where the changes in radius are moderate .      during the hydrogen shell",
    "flashes the expansion of the outermost layers ( from a few 0.01 solar radii to a few solar radii ) forces the he - wds to evolve back into the rgb domain in the hrd ( see figs .",
    "[ pic2 ] and [ pic3 ] ) . due to the binary nature of he - wds , in principle",

    ", the consumption of envelope mass occurs preferentielly due to the high mass - loss phase when the models are close to their roche limit ( @xmath183 , see fig .",
    "[ pic8 ] ) .",
    "for instance , for the sequence with @xmath184 it is @xmath185 , corresponding to a mean mass loss of @xmath186 lasting for @xmath187 .",
    "afterwards @xmath43 is further reduced by due to nuclear burning ( see fig .  [ pic16 ] ) .",
    "= 6.6 cm    = 6.8 cm    in the end , the envelope masses are almost the same when the different models enter the final cooling branch ( @xmath188 , see fig .  [ pic16 ] ) ,",
    "i.e. the residual envelope mass and the corresponding cooling evolution are rather independent from the evolutionary history .",
    "on one hand , the latter result is consistent with the results of iben & tutukov ( 1986 ) . in the case of roche lobe",
    "overflow the high mass loss determines the evolutionary speed , whereas otherwise the evolution is characterized by the thermal timescale of the envelope . on the other hand , in their @xmath17 model",
    "the high mass loss causes a considerable loss of envelope mass ( @xmath189 ) and prevents hydrogen burning from becoming ever dominant again .",
    "consequently , their model cools down quite rapidly .",
    "the cooling time is of the order of a few @xmath145 whereas our models are controlled by residual hydrogen burning leading to cooling times of the order of gyr ( see figs .",
    "[ lt0234 ] and [ lt0259 ] ) .",
    "thus , from our calculations it appears that different mass loss histories during the phase of the hydrogen shell flashes do not influence the final cooling of he - wds significantly .",
    "this result seems to be consistent with the calculations of kippenhahn et al .",
    "( 1968 ) : their @xmath190 model evolves through one major hydrogen shell flash and one strong subflash , both bringing the white dwarf radius above the critical roche radius ( points q to r and t to u in their fig .  1 ) , resulting in a total mass loss of about @xmath191 which is comparable to the @xmath192 of the present calculation with only one high mass - loss episode . after a rapid evolution",
    "back to the cooling branch the evolution is slowed down , and at @xmath193 ( point w in their calculation ) a cooling age of approximately 2.55 gyr is reached , comparable with our @xmath59 model which has at the same position @xmath194 gyr . on the other hand , by assuming a linear correlation between @xmath195 and @xmath196 as a first approximation , the cooling age of the model of iben & tutukov ( 1986 ) can be estimated to be only @xmath197 at @xmath193 ( using their points s and t , see their fig .  1 and table 1 ) .",
    "this value is almost one order of magnitude below the one given by models which allow hydrogen burning to continue .",
    "we have calculated evolutionary models of low - mass white dwarfs with helium cores to study in detail their cooling behaviour and their evolution including phases of thermally unstable hydrogen burning ( hydrogen shell flashes ) .",
    "we found that the occurrence of these thermal instabilities is restricted to the mass range @xmath198 .",
    "it is noteworthy that a sufficient temporal resolution is essential to avoid numerical fluctuations in the energy output of the shell during early cooling branch evolution .",
    "the flashes occur during the fast cooling of the shell at the beginning of the cooling branch evolution .",
    "this especially affects the lower part of the shell region where cno cycling is the dominant contribution to hydrogen burning .",
    "cno - burning is temperature sensitive enough to cause thermal instabilities if two conditions are fulfilled : the shell is thin enough ( this is obviously not the case for @xmath199 ) and the cooling time is large enough as to avoid an extinction of the shell before the instability is fully established ( this does not hold for @xmath200 ) .",
    "the final cooling is not affected from possible flash events , i.e. hydrogen shell burning establishes again as dominant energy source at the end of the flash episode as in the case of non - flash models .",
    "this result also holds when roche - lobe overflow of the he - wd to a companion is considered during the expansion into the rgb regime .",
    "one of the main features related to hydrogen shell flashes is the change of envelope composition due to a pulse - driven convection zone which temporarily extends to the outermost layers of the star .",
    "the resulting drop in hydrogen is @xmath2 .    while the typical duration of a hydrogen flash is short compared to the cooling time of he - wds ( @xmath151 compared to gyr ) and he - wds evolve close to their cooling tracks for most of the time during a flash , the influence of these unstable phases on the mass - radius - relation of helium white dwarfs is moderate and restricted to effective temperatures of @xmath201 k.    f.h .",
