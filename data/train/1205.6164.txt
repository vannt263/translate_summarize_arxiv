    "unconventional superconductors usually refer to the superconductors those can not be understood within the conventional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory",
    ". notable examples of unconventional superconductors include high-@xmath1 cuprate superconductor , heavy fermion superconductor , and iron - based superconductor .",
    "unlike bcs superconductors , unconventional superconductivity is generally driven by electron - electron interactions , and often has a magnetic origin .",
    "another interesting property of unconventional superconductor is that its ground state is not unique .",
    "in addition to the defining superconducting state , unconventional superconductors also exhibit a variety of other symmetry - broken ground states , including antiferromagnetc , nematic , and stripe states , upon tuning such parameters as doping and pressure @xcite .",
    "a widely recognized notion is that the long - range superconducting order competes , and under certain circumstances coexists , with other long - range orders .",
    "the competition and possible coexistence between different orders can give rise to rich properties , and hence have attracted intense theoretical and experimental interest in the past years .",
    "the successful microscopic theory of competing orders has not yet been established to date , primarily because the pairing mechanism in most unconventional superconductors is still undetermined .",
    "a realistic and commonly used strategy is to build low - energy effective field theory on phenomenological grounds .",
    "one can first write down the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) actions for two bosonic order parameters and then introduce certain coupling terms between these two scalar fields . such generalized gl model has recently been applied to describe competing orders in a number of unconventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "an early success of such theoretical investigation is the prediction of field - induced antiferromagnetic core in the supercondcuting vortices of high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite .",
    "this prediction was subsequently confirmed in experiments @xcite .",
    "interestingly , experiments further found that the antiferromagnetic order not only exists in the vortex cores , but also extends into the superconducting region @xcite and exhibits nontrivial spatial modulation @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological field theory that contains a simple quadratic - quadratic coupling term between superconducting and antiferromagnetic order parameters was put forward to understand these new findings @xcite .",
    "recently , the issue of competing orders has attracted revived interest .",
    "it is found that the competitive interaction between distinct orders can drive an instability , which gives rise to a general tendency of first order transition @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon may account for the first order transition observed in some unconventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "in addition , nonuniform glassy electronic phases and brazovskii type transitions are predicted to emerge due to competition between two long - range orders @xcite .",
    "another interesting observation is that the competition between superconducting and antiferromagnetic orders can help to judge the gap symmetry of iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the competition between superconducting and nematic orders might be responsible for @xcite the electronic anisotropy observed in the vortex state of fese superconductor @xcite .",
    "the effective field theory adopted in previous analysis of competing orders normally contains only two bosonic order parameters .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom are usually completely integrated out in the spirit of hertz - millis - moriya ( hmm ) theory @xcite .",
    "this integration procedure is expected to be applicable in systems that do not contain gapless fermionic excitations .",
    "for instance , the iron - based superconductors seem to have a @xmath5-wave energy gap , so the electronic excitations are fully gapped and can be safely integrated out @xcite . however , such integration manipulation is not always valid .",
    "indeed , its validity has recently been questioned in several itinerant electron systems @xcite . in the systems that exhibit gapless fermionic excitations , integrating out fermions may lead to singularities , especially in the vicinity of quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "actually , infrared singularities have been found on the border of several quantum phase transitions @xcite . in order to properly describe the quantum critical behavior in these systems ,",
    "it is more appropriate to maintain both bosonic order parameter and gapless fermions in the effective theory .",
    "when a long - range order competing with superconductivity also couples to gapless fermions , it would be interesting to go beyond hmm theory and examine the role of gapless fermions .",

    "the nematic phase transition and the coupling of nematic fluctuation with fermionic degrees of freedom have stimulated intense research efforts @xcite . from a field - theoretic viewpoint ,",
    "the nematic order parameter is a simple real scalar field and does not carry finite wave vector , which substantially simplifies theoretical calculations .",
    "it is known that high-@xmath1 superconductor has a @xmath13 energy gap , which vanishes at four nodes , @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , gapless nodal quasiparticles ( qps ) are present even at the lowest energy in the superconducting phase .",
    "these nodal qps are believed to be responsible for many anomalous low - temperature properties of the superconducting dome . when a nematic qcp exists somewhere in the superconducting dome , as shown in fig",
    ".  1 , the fluctuation of nematic order parameter will couple to these nodal qps .",
    "such coupling can generate non - fermi liquid behaviors and other unusual phenomena in the vicinity of nematic qcp @xcite .",
    "it may also have significant effects on the interplay between superconductivity and nematic order , which is the topic of this paper .    in the following ,",
    "we first write down an effective field theory that describes both the competitive interaction between superconducting and nematic order parameters and the coupling between nematic order and nodal qps .",
    "we then perform a detailed renormalization group ( rg ) analysis @xcite within such effective theory . in particular , we drive and solve the rg flow equations of all the physical parameters in order to determine the possible stable fixed points .",
    "we show that the competitive interaction between superconducting and nematic order parameters still lead to first order transition after including gapless nodal qps",
    ". however , the nodal qps do have important impacts on the fixed - point structure .",
    "in particular , the velocity ratio @xmath3 between gap velocity @xmath15 and fermi velocity @xmath16 of nodal qps turns out to be a crucial controlling parameter .",
    "the region that exhibits runaway behavior is greatly enlarged as @xmath3 decreases , implying an enhanced possibility of first order transition . at the nematic qcp",
    "where @xmath4 driven by the critical nematic fluctuation , the system does not have any stable fixed point , so first order transition occurs inevitably .",
