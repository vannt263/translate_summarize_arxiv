    "the quasicontinuum ( qc ) method @xcite is a prototypical coarse - graining technique for the static and quasi - static simulation of crystalline solids .",
    "one of its key features is that , instead of coupling an atomistic model to a continuum model , it uses the atomistic model also in the continuum region where degrees of freedom are removed from the model by means of piecewise linear interpolation .",
    "however , the nonlocal nature of the atomistic interactions makes further approximation necessary to enable the computation of energies or forces with complexity proportional to the number of coarse degrees of freedom .",
    "two families of approximations have been developed to achieve this goal .",
    "one family of approximations localizes the interactions by a strain energy density ( based on the cauchy  born rule ) which provides sufficient accuracy in regions away from defects where the strain gradient varies slowly .",
    "classical finite element methodology can then be utilized in those regions modeled by the strain energy density .",
    "this class of quasicontinuum approximations have been the subject of many recent mathematical analyses  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the second family of approximations that have been developed to reduce the computational complexity of the quasicontinuum method .",
    "these methods , which have received far less mathematical attention , use summation rules ( discrete variants of continuous quadrature rules ) to approximate the sums that define the quasicontinuum energy or forces . to the best of our knowledge , the force - based cluster summation rule of knap and ortiz @xcite , the _ non - local qc method _ based on a simple trapezoidal rule ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.3 ) , or its extension to energy - based cluster summation rules @xcite have not been analyzed to date .",
    "these cluster summation rules approximate the sum over atom - based quantities by uniformly averaging over atoms in clusters ( balls ) around the nodes and then by weighting these cluster averages so that summands that are obtained from piecewise linear interpolation with respect to the quasicontinuum mesh are exactly computed .",
    "in a recent benchmark of different qc methods @xcite , the cluster summation rules do not compare favorably with quasicontinuum approximations that utilize the strain energy density or with other atomistic - to - continuum coupling methods . in the present paper ,",
    "we give a simple yet rigorous analytical explanation for this poor performance .",
    "we demonstrate that , even for the simplest imaginable atomistic model , a periodic one - dimensional chain with harmonic nearest - neighbour interaction , the cluster summation rules formulated in @xcite lead to inconsistent and inaccurate qc methods when used with graded and non - smooth meshes . increasing the cluster size",
    "does not resolve this problem .",
    "the benchmark @xcite uses a mesh that is refined from large triangles to the atomistic scale as is typical for quasicontinuum computations .",
    "our analysis shows that this kind of refined mesh would lead to an inconsistent and inaccurate method for the approximation of our one - dimensional model by cluster summation rules .",
    "the atomistic model , the finite element space ( _ coarse space _ ) , and some additional notation are introduced in sections [ sec : intro : model_problem ] and [ sec : intro : cqc ] .",
    "we treat the two classes of cluster summation methods separately ; the force - based summation rule in section [ sec : f ] and the energy - based summation rule in section [ sec : e ] .",
    "these sections can be read independently of each other .",
    "finally , in the conclusion , several possibilities are identified how cluster summation rules might be modified in order to lead to accuracte qc methods .    although our analysis treats the approximation of the discrete sums in the quasicontinuum energy , the reasons for the lack of accuracy of the cluster summation rules can already be understood from applying the cluster - method concepts to the finite element approximation of continuum elasticity  @xcite .",
    "the force conjugate to a finite element nodal degree of freedom ( the negative of the partial derivative of the elastic energy functional constrained to the space of finite element trial functions ) depends only on integrals of the jump of the displacement gradient across the element boundaries ( the finite element force density ) .",
    "the accuracy of cluster - based quadrature relies on the finite element force density being smooth in space ; however , the support of this force is concentrated on the element boundaries .",
    "thus , the _ conjugate forces _ obtained from the cluster - based quadrature will be much too large .",
    "accurate node - based quadrature rules used in the approximation of a continuum finite element energy are computed within each element during the assembly process , which leads naturally to an accurate mesh - dependent non - uniform weighting of the energy density in any ball surrounding each node .",
    "the cluster - based quadrature approximation uses a uniform weighting in the ball surrounding each node .",
    "thus , since the energy density for a displacement in the finite element trial space is generally discontinuous at the nodes , the cluster - based quadrature rules are likely to be inaccurate for nonuniform meshes .",
    "we have not included the formulations of lin @xcite or of gunzburger & zhang @xcite , which are closely related to cluster summation methods , in our analysis .",
    "our main reason for this exclusion is that their formulations do not suffer from the same deficiencies as the methods which we investiate here . _",
    "if _ errors are present in their approach ( we have not investigated this further ) , they would most likely be caused by finite range interaction and can not be observed for the simple nearest - neighbour interaction system which we investigate here .",
    "we choose the simplest immaginable atomistic model problem , a one - dimensional periodic chain with nearest - neighbour pair potential interaction .",
    "the continuum reference domain will be @xmath0 $ ] . for fixed @xmath1 ,",
    "the atomic spacing is given by @xmath2 , and the atomistic reference lattice by @xmath3 the space of periodic displacements of @xmath4 is denoted @xmath5 we refer to remark [ rem : intro : non - smooth_soln ] for a motivation of the constraint @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the interatomic interaction reaches only nearest neighbours , and that the only external force is a dead load .",
    "thus , we can write the _ total energy _ as a sum of a _ stored energy _ @xmath7 and an _ external potential energy _ @xmath8:$ ] @xmath9 ,   \\intertext{where }    \\notag    \\e(v ) = ~ & \\sum_{\\ell = -n+1}^n \\eps\\phi\\big ( \\eps^{-1}(v_\\ell    - v_{\\ell-1})\\big ) , \\quad \\text{and } \\\\    \\notag    f[v ] = ~ & \\sum_{-n+1}^n \\eps f_\\ell v_\\ell.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is assumed to be smooth , at least in a neighbourhood of zero , and @xmath11 is a fixed @xmath12-periodic sequence .",
    "in fact , we shall usually make the simplifying assumption that @xmath10 is a convex quadratic and that @xmath13 is obtained , for example , by nodal interpolation from a smooth 2-periodic function @xmath14 .",
    "such assumptions are valid for small displacements from the reference state .",
    "rescaling the domain ( and the energy ) by the atomistic spacing @xmath15 is not strictly necessary , but it helps us understand the connection of the atomistic problem to continuum theory .    the atomistic problem is to find @xmath16 where ` @xmath17 ' denotes the set of local minimizers of @xmath18 in @xmath19 .",
    "the first order necessary criticality condition , in variational form , is @xmath20 = f[v ] \\qquad \\forall v \\in \\x,\\ ] ] in short , @xmath21 .",
    "[ rem : intro : non - smooth_soln ] in the definition of the displacement space , we have imposed the condition @xmath6 for admissible displacements .",
    "this is one of several ways to remove the zero mode from the space in order to render the energy functional @xmath18 coercive .",
    "furthermore , this constraint allows us to easily construct a problem with a ` singularity ' at the origin ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : e : graded ] ) . in general ,",
    "if the external force @xmath13 is ` smooth ' and anti - symmetric , then the solution will be ` smooth ' as well .",
    "if @xmath13 is not anti - symmetric , then the solution may have a ` kink ' at the origin even if @xmath13 is smooth .",
    "we fix some additional notation , some of which we have already used above .",
    "the arguments of nonlinear functionals are enclosed in round brackets while those of ( multi-)linear forms are enclosed in square brackets , for example , @xmath22 or @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the frchet derivatives are denoted by @xmath24 , for example , @xmath25 is a linear form on @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , @xmath26 $ ] denotes a directional derivative .",
    "similarly , @xmath27 is a bilinear form on @xmath19 , and it is written @xmath28 $ ] with arguments @xmath29 .",
    "finally , we will frequently use the notation @xmath30 to denote the differences .",
    "atomistic displacements are always identified with their piecewise affine interpolants . in particular , for @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 for @xmath33 . through this identification ,",
    "the space @xmath19 is naturally embedded in the spaces @xmath34 for @xmath35      the quasicontinuum approximation to the atomistic model problem is obtained in two steps : ( i ) replacing the displacement space @xmath19 by a low - dimensional _ coarse _ space @xmath36 , and ( ii ) approximating the nonlinear system for arguments from the coarse space . often , the process is in fact reversed , however , for the class of qc methods which we consider in the present paper , the order is as stated above .",
    "we fix a set of _ rep - atoms _ @xmath37 so that @xmath38 .",
    "the set @xmath39 is @xmath40-periodically extended , that is , we define @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "the coarse space can therefore be written as @xmath43    the _ constrained atomistic approximation _ is to find @xmath44 for which the first order criticality condition is @xmath45 = f[v_h ] \\qquad    \\forall v_h \\in \\x_h.\\ ] ] even though the number of degrees of freedom is significantly reduced in , the nonlinear system is still prohibitively expensive to evaluate since it requires summation over _ all _ atoms .",
    "hence , the second step of the qc method , the approximation of the nonlinear system , is as important as the coarsening step .",
    "one class of methods to achieve this are the ( cluster-)summation rules which we investigate in the following sections @xcite .",
    "we conclude the introduction with some additional notation related to the coarse space @xmath36 . for @xmath46",
    "we denote @xmath47 .",
    "we will assume throughout that the mesh satisfies a local regularity condition : there exists a constant @xmath48 such that @xmath49 for @xmath50 we denote @xmath51 the ( @xmath40-periodic ) vector of nodal values , so that @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the periodic nodal basis function associated with node @xmath54",
    ". furthermore , we denote @xmath55 the _ gradient _ of @xmath56 in the element @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath58 if @xmath59 .",
    "since they are more easily understood , we shall first investigate the force - based summation rules , introduced by knap and ortiz @xcite .",
    "our presentation closely follows their formulation .    instead of viewing the constrained approximation as a minimization problem , we concentrate purely on the equilibrium equations .",
    "however , instead of the variational formulation , we use the _ nodal force _",

    ", we assume that @xmath77 . to motivate this assumption",
    ", we note that external body forces are only rarely the driving force in an atomistic simulation and would therefore distort the picture we are about to present .",
    "we shall simply ignore the fact that , as a result , the atomistic problem becomes trivial .",
    "if @xmath77 , it follows that @xmath78 and , if we insert @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 it follows that , independently of the cluster size , we obtain @xmath81 since @xmath82 , for all @xmath73 , the equation @xmath83 is equivalent to @xmath84    thus , we see that , even though the cluster summation rule is grossly inaccurate for moderate cluster radii ( the weights @xmath69 are of order @xmath85 ) , the resulting system is nevertheless equivalent to an exact evaluation of the full constrained approximation which is known to be an excellent approximation to the full atomistic system @xcite .    we need to be careful in extrapolating this observation to the case of finite range interaction and indeed the much more subtle and interesting two- and three - dimensional setting . these situations need to be investigated in more detail .",
    "nevertheless , we can make some comments to motivate further investigation .",
    "the main observation that we have made in the present section , that forces are concentrated on the interfaces is still valid . in 2d and 3d , and for general atomistic models ,",
    "the identity @xmath86 remains true ( note , however , that now @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 ) .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of an external force , in the interior of a large element , the force @xmath90 is zero ( or negligibly small ) for an atomistic model with short range interaction . from this , we see that the contributions to the force on the node @xmath67 are concentrated _ near _ all element faces which touch the repatom @xmath67 .",
    "this shows that the summation rule used to obtain @xmath91 should be obtained from a summation over these faces ( surface integration ) instead of summation over the entire patch ( volume integration ) .",
    "we now return to the case of non - zero forces .",
    "we shall assume that the forces @xmath11 are obtained by interpolating a smooth 2-periodic function @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "in this case , we obtain @xmath93 and hence , @xmath94 it is then fairly straightforward to see that @xmath95 where @xmath96 is obtained by applying the cluster summation rule to the external forces only , @xmath97 since we assumed that @xmath92 $ ] , we can deduce from a fairly straightforward interpolation error analysis ( cf .",

    "f : noforce ] is because the external force contribution was summed accurately , while the summation of the interatomic forces is grossly inaccurate .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the failure of the cluster summation rule applied to the force balance equations fails because a ` volume integration ' method was applied to a ` surface integral ' .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to investigate the cluster summation rule applied to the energy functional .",
    "this would lead to a conservative coarse grained system , which was the main motivation for eidel and stukowski @xcite to use this method .",
    "they have noted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) that this method also has shortcomings , and we shall analyze these in detail in the present section .    to formulate the energy - based cluster summation rule , we first rewrite the stored energy functional @xmath108 in the form @xmath109 the term @xmath110 is the contribution of the atom at site @xmath111 to the overall energy .",

    "we can relate the connection between the error in the cluster approximation to the error in the trapezoidal rule by noting that is equivalent to @xmath136    from and , we already anticipate that the local mesh smoothness will have a significant impact on the accuracy of the method .",
    "for example , if the @xmath134 are oscillatory , then it is possible to lower the energy by introducing a ` microstructure ' into the quasi - continuum displacement .",

    "once again , the crucial questions are whether this accuracy can be retained for finite range interaction and the application relevant two- three - dimensional situations .",
    "the analysis presented in this appendix applies to both the energy - based and the force - based summation rules , since the weights satisfy @xmath221 . for no particular reason",
    ", we chose to work with the weights @xmath222 .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath74 . according to the requirement ,",
    "the governing equations for the weights @xmath223 are @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 to prove that @xmath227 is invertible , we show that it is row - diagonally dominant . for each @xmath228",
    "we have @xmath229 since we assumed that the clusters do not overlap , it follows that @xmath230 , in particular , @xmath231 , from which we deduce that @xmath232 thus , @xmath227 is invertible and @xmath233 is well - defined .",
    "we note , furthermore , that implies that @xmath234      we shall now prove that the exact weights @xmath238 are only @xmath118 perturbations from the approximate weights obtained by mass - lumping . to this end",
    ", we define the residual @xmath239 , @xmath240 if the mesh is uniform or if @xmath241 , then @xmath242 . in general , under the mesh regularity assumption we obtain the residual estimate @xmath243 to estimate the error on the weights , we note that @xmath244 , and hence @xmath245 that is , we obtain @xmath246 this may seem an impossibly strong result at first glance , however , we note that it is only true under the restriction that @xmath247 for all @xmath73 .",
    "we expect that , in general , the cluster size will influence the estimate to give an error of order @xmath248 .",
    "let @xmath251 be the interpolation operator for the quasicontinuum mesh , that is , @xmath252 with @xmath253 , @xmath254 .",
    "let @xmath255 be given by @xmath256 , then @xmath257 in view of our assumption that @xmath258 where @xmath92 $ ] , and the interpolation error estimate of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm a.4 ) , it follows that @xmath259 since , by definition , piecewise affine functions are summed exactly by the cluster summation rule , it follows that @xmath260 applying the same argument as above , we can deduce that @xmath261 from which the desired result follows .",
