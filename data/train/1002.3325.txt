    "one of the most interesting findings of the lasco instrument onboard the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) spacecraft has been the observation of a continuous outflow of material in the solar streamer belt .",
    "an analysis performed using a difference image technique ( @xcite , @xcite ) has revealed the presence of plasma density enhancements , called `` blobs '' , accelerating away from the sun .",
    "these plasmoids are seen to originate just beyond the cusps of helmet streamers as radially elongated structures a few percent denser than the surrounding plasma sheet , of approximately @xmath0 in length and @xmath1 in width .",
    "they are observed to accelerate radially outward maintaining constant angular spans at a nearly constant acceleration up to the velocity of @xmath2@xmath3 , in the spatial region between about @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it has been inferred that the blobs are `` tracers '' of the slow wind , being carried out by the ambient plasma flow @xcite .",
    "the solar streamer belt is a structure consisting of a magnetic configuration centered on the current sheet , which extends above the cusp of a coronal helmet .",
    "the region underlying the cusp is made up of closed magnetic structures , with the cusp representing the point where separatrices between closed and open field lines intersect .",
    "further from the sun , at solar minimum , the streamer belt around the equator appears as a laminar configuration consisting of a thick plasma sheet with a density about @xmath6 order of magnitude higher than the surrounding plasma , in which much narrower and complex structures are embedded . as a first approximation , moving from the center of the streamer in polar directions at radii greater than the radius of the cusp , the radial component of the magnetic field increases from zero , having opposite values on the two sides of the current sheet .",
    "as far as the flow distribution is concerned , the fast solar wind originates from the unipolar regions outside the streamer belt , while the slowest flows are located at the center of the sheet .    explaining how both the slow and the fast component of the solar wind are accelerated is one of the outstanding problem in solar physics .",
    "although the association between the slow solar wind and the streamer belt ( e.g. @xcite ) and between the fast wind and the polar coronal holes is broadly recognized , the mechanism which leads to such accelerations is still a matter of debate .",
    "@xcite developed a magnetohydrodynamic model ( later extended to the compressible case in @xcite ) that accounts for many of the typical features observed in the slow component of the solar wind : the region above the cusp of a helmet streamer is modelled as a current sheet embedded in a broader wake flow .",
    "this and previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) show that reconnection of the magnetic field occurs at the current sheet and that in the non - linear regime , when the equilibrium magnetic field is substantially modified , a kelvin - helmoltz instability develops , leading to the acceleration of density enhanced magnetic islands @xcite .",
    "the problem we study has a roughly spherical symmetry , but in our simulations we approximate the region beyond the cusp of a helmet streamer with a rectangular box , and the geometry of the fields with a cartesian geometry , instead of a spherical one . to perform the numerical calculations we use a 2d numerical code with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction ( the spatial direction aligned with the mean flow ) and",
    "non - reflecting boundary conditions in the cross - stream direction ( the spatial direction along which the initial mean flow varies ) .",
    "a key feature , at the same time an advantage and a limitation of our analysis , is that thanks to the periodic boundary conditions that we use in the direction of the flow we are allowed to proceed in all our numerical simulations in a pseudo - lagrangian fashion : i.e. the size of the computional box is fixed and then the time evolution of the spatial region moving with the box is followed in time , simply because what goes out from one side comes in from the other . in this case",
    "we follow the development of the magnetic island during its acceleration outward along the radial direction . with respect to spatially developing studies of the solar wind",
    "our time developing method is able to reach a higher resolution . in our case in fact",
    "the computational domain is smaller and we are allowed to increase the grid resolution along the current sheet in order to resolve the small scales developing during the non - linear stage , and hence enabling us to study the development of a resistive - like instability that would be lost in a spatially developing study with a much lower resolution . on the other hand , so far no one has been able to study this phenomenon in spherical geometry , and we are planning to do it as the next step in the development of our model .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce two major effects related to the spherical symmetry of the problem we study . in what follows",
    "we suppose that when the magnetic island , the `` blob '' , moves outward along the radial direction it suffers a spherical expansion due to the approximate spherical topology of the physical fields ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "although the subsequent algebra is quite complicated , as this approach enables us to attach the problem thanks to the availability of enough grid points , we still want to use the previous pseudo - lagrangian time developing technique .",
    "this necessarily requires the use of a rectangular computational box and fields with a cartesian geometry , but we can include the expansion suffered by a parcel of plasma propagating outward by making the box expand at the correct rate .",
    "this is done by inserting a suitable force term in the momentum equation , a generalization to the variable velocity regime of the expanding box model developed by @xcite , @xcite , as described in the following sections .",
    "the other spherical effect included in the present paper is the so - called `` melon - seed '' force .",
    "this is a diamagnetic force that a region of closed magnetic field lines suffers when it is embedded in a radially divergent background magnetic field ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "while in a spherical geometry this force would rise naturally , in our cartesian approximation we take it into account by inserting a suitable force term in the momentum equation , in analogy with the expanding box model .",
    "section  [ sec : pm ] describes the governing equations as well as the initial and boundary conditions , the last ones described with more details in the appendix . in section  [ sec : re ] we detail our numerical results .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] contains a discussion of our results , as well as some concluding remarks .",
    "in our analysis and simulations we use the compressible , isothermal , dissipative , three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations , that we write here in dimensionless form : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 supplemented by the equation of state @xmath10 . in the above equations @xmath11 is the mass density",
    ", @xmath12 is the flow velocity , @xmath13 is the thermal pressure , @xmath14 is the magnetic induction field , @xmath15 is the plasma temperature and @xmath16 is the viscous stress tensor . to render non - dimensional the equations we used the characteristic quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the related quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the proton mass .",
    "we use a simplified diffusion model , in which both the magnetic resistivity ( @xmath25 ) and the shear viscosity ( @xmath26 ) are constant and uniform .",
    "a stokes relationship is assumed , so that for the bulk viscosity @xmath27 .",
    "the kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers  @xmath28 and @xmath29 are then given by : @xmath30    to ensure the solenoidality of the magnetic field , and supposing that there is no variation of the fields along @xmath31 , we introduce the magnetic potential @xmath32 defined by : @xmath33 and replace equation  ( [ eq : mhd3 ] ) with : @xmath34 \\\\ \\label{eq : mhd4 }   & & \\frac{\\partial b_z}{\\partial t } =    - b_z \\left ( \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x }   + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y } \\right )   + b_x \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial x }   + b_y \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial y } \\\\ & & \\qquad \\quad   - u_x \\frac{\\partial b_z}{\\partial x } - u_y \\frac{\\partial b_z}{\\partial y } + \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{r}_m } \\left [   \\frac{\\partial^2 b_z}{\\partial x^2 } + \\frac{\\partial^2 b_z}{\\partial y^2 } \\right ] , \\label{eq : mhd5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the equations solved in our numerical simulations depend on the problem that is studied : equations , are solved when we do not take into account the expansion and the diamagnetic force , whereas when we consider these last effects some new force terms are added to the equations , and a coordinate transformation is implemented for a matter of convenience , as described forward in this section . in any case",
    "the numerical problem is simplified by assuming that there is no variation in one of the spatial coordinates ( @xmath31 ) . in the following we refer to the spatial coordinate aligned with the mean flow as the streamwise direction  ( @xmath35 ) , the spatial coordinate along which the mean flow varies as the cross - stream direction  ( @xmath36 ) , and to the remaining ( spanwise ) direction as  @xmath31 .",
    "the system has periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction , along which a fourier pseudospectral method is used in the numerical computations , and nonreflecting boundary conditions , achieved via the method of projected characteristics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , in the cross - stream direction , where a compact finite difference scheme of the sixth order is used @xcite .",
    "this method , coupled with a hyperbolic tangent mesh stretching around the current sheet , allows reasonable reynolds numbers to be achieved without increasing the number of grid points dramatically .",
    "we solve the equations in a 2d box whose dimensions are @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the streamwise wavenumber ( the value of the box length along the @xmath36 direction is the result of the mesh stretching ) .",
    "time is discretized with a third - order runge - kutta method . in the simulations that we present in this paper we used a numerical grid with @xmath39 points , and for all simulations",
    "the reynolds numbers are @xmath40 .",
    "for a better description of the numerical techniques used in our code see @xcite .",
    "the region where the acceleration of the solar wind occurs would be more aptly described in spherical coordinates , but in order to perform our numerical simulations we do a cartesian approximation , i.e. we approximate the fields topology with a cartesian one . in this way we can use our pseudo - lagrangian technique using a 2d code .",
    "as previously said we include the spherical expansion suffered by a parcel of plasma propagating outward by making expand our computational box at the correct rate .",
    "the region we study ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) is a spherical sector of angular extent @xmath38 in the cross - stream direction ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath41 in the span - wise direction , whose length is @xmath42 along the stream - wise direction ( @xmath35 ) and whose distance from the center of the sun is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 changes in time while the plasma flows outward along the radial direction .",
    "we approximate this region with a parallelepiped whose cross lengths are respectively @xmath45 and @xmath46 along the directions @xmath36 and @xmath31 , and whose length in the radial direction is @xmath42 .",
    "we suppose that when the plasma present in this region moves outward it suffers an average expansion that we approximate with the expansion of the box ( see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "when following the evolution in the comoving frame of reference a non - inertial force term arises . in the appendix",
    "it is shown that the force field for unity of mass that inserted in the momentum equation yields the correct expansion of the computational box is the following : @xmath47 in the previous equation the velocity of the box and its distance from the center of the sun are defined as : @xmath48 @xmath49 i.e. we define the velocity of the box as the average velocity in the @xmath35 direction along the center of the computational box .",
    "the basic numerical algorithm was developed and tested by @xcite , @xcite who showed that the ebm gives a correct description of the evolution of waves ( exact wave - action conservation ) and turbulence in an expanding medium as well as capturing basic features of the expanding solar wind such as the formation of corotating interaction regions and forward and reverse shocks between high speed and low speed solar wind .",
    "the ebm does not conserve energy because in an expanding flow work is done by the plasma .",
    "angular momentum and magnetic flux are conserved exactly however ( see @xcite for a detailed description and tests of the physical model ) .",
    "the force term  ( [ eq : fexp0 ] ) introduces a variation along the @xmath36 and @xmath31  coordinates , but this explicit coordinate dependence cancels when we make a coordinate transformation to a self - similarly expanding transverse coordinate @xmath50 defined by @xmath51 it can be easily verified that in this way the expanding computational domain coordinate is transformed to a fixed computational grid .",
    "the equations solved by our 2d numerical code and all the mathematical details are extensively explained in the appendix .",
    "when we make our cartesian approximation we approximate the radially diverging magnetic field lines with straight ones , losing the radial nonhomogeneity of the solar magnetic field .",
    "an effect that is lost with this approximation is the so - called `` melon seed '' force , a diamagnetic force acting on a region of closed magnetic field lines .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) that a region of closed magnetic field lines embedded in a background radially diverging magnetic field is subject to such force",
    ". modeling this region as a prolate spheroid of volume  @xmath52 elongated in the radial direction it can be demonstrated that the value of the total force acting on the spheroid is approximately : @xmath53 \\boldsymbol{\\hat{e}}_y,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the background magnetic field , @xmath55 being constant . in our model axial invariance",
    "is assumed , i.e. there is no variation in the @xmath31 direction in the cartesian approximation .",
    "hence the prolate spheroid is modeled as a cylinder with an elliptical cross section , and the same force for unit volume is used .",
    "the force given in equation  ( [ ms ] ) is the total force acting on this plasmoid .",
    "the force per unit volume derived from this equation and used in our computations is given by : @xmath56 that written in non dimensional form is given by : @xmath57 in which @xmath58 is a field whose value is @xmath59 inside magnetic island and @xmath60 outside . in this way the field  ( [ msfl ] ) integrated over the volume of the plasmoid gives as a result the total force  ( [ ms ] ) .",
    "the region above the cusp of a helmet streamer is assumed to be in local hydrodynamic equilibrium , therefore gravity , magnetic curvature forces and the flow all balance out .",
    "once density fluctuations arise , the gravitational force reappears as an archimedes buoyancy force acting on regions with a different density compared to the average . this force field can be written in non - dimensional form as @xmath61 @xmath62 being the gravitational constant and @xmath63 the solar mass .",
    "taking as characteristic length and velocity , the width of the wake @xmath64 and the velocity of the fast solar wind @xmath65 , we obtain the value @xmath66 .",
    "we can now compare the relative strength of this buoyancy force with that of the melon - seed force ( [ msfl2 ] ) .",
    "as shown in the next paragraph @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( i.e. @xmath69 in conventional units , and supposing @xmath70 , we obtain near the cusp of the helmet streamer ( @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 i.e. the buoyancy force is negligible with respect to the melon seed force near the cusp of the helmet streamer and in the region of interest of the simulations presented in the following paragraphs .    in the next section we introduce as initial conditions the fields ( [ eq : equi1])-([eq : equi2 ] ) .",
    "these fields are a one - dimensional equilibrium for the region beyond the cusp of a helmet streamer , i.e. the variation of the fields is only along the cross - stream direction ( the @xmath36 coordinate ) and solar corona reynolds numbers are so high that they are substantially an equilibrium solution of equations ( [ eq : mhd1])-([eq : mhd4 ] ) over the time scales of our simulations .",
    "but in our computational domain reynolds numbers are limited by resolution to values around @xmath40 , values which are so small that unphysical diffusion of equilibrium fields would take place . in the foregoing equations",
    "the pattern of the diffusion terms is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a generic field .",
    "as the variation of the equilibrium fields is only along the @xmath36  coordinate , i.e. as a fourier series in the @xmath35  direction they have only a @xmath75  mode , we avoid such an unphysical diffusion using instead of  eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) the following one : @xmath76 in this way the modes  @xmath75 of the fourier series in the @xmath35 direction , that we indicate with  @xmath77 , do not diffuse .",
    "this could have potentially given rise to development of excessively small scales in @xmath36 on the @xmath75 harmonic but empirically the numerical filtering used along this direction has been enough .",
    "we model a planar section of the solar streamer belt , in the region beyond the cusp of a helmet streamer , as a magnetic current sheet of thickness @xmath78 embedded in the center of a broader wake flow of thickness @xmath79 .",
    "the plasma flows at the speed of the fast solar wind at the edges and at a much lower velocity at the sheet .",
    "taking as characteristic length the thickness of the wake @xmath80 , and as characteristic density and velocity those of the fast wind @xmath81 , @xmath82 , the basic fields , written in non - dimensional form , are then given by : @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the ratio of the two widths , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are respectively the alfvn number , the ratio between the alfvn speed ( @xmath89 ) and the flow speed ( @xmath90 ) , and the sonic mach number , the ratio between the flow speed ( @xmath90 ) and the sound speed ( @xmath91 ) , of the system at the edges , i.e. of the fast wind : @xmath92 our wake - current sheet model is then characterized by three parameters , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath93 , which vary considerably in the solar corona as a function of the distance from the sun . in this paper we are interested in studying the time    , @xmath94 .",

    "scaledwidth=47.0% ]    @xmath89 is approximately @xmath98@xmath99 , the sound speed @xmath91 is about @xmath100 , and the velocity of the fast solar wind @xmath101 is @xmath102 .",
    "it follows that @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "the plasma @xmath41 is also a useful quantity , defined as @xmath105 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath106 . in our numerical calculations we use values of these parameters that are close to these estimates but computationally more accessible .",
    "thus , in our runs @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( hence @xmath109 ) .",
    "unfortunately there is no direct observation of the heliospheric current sheet close to the sun ( @xmath110 ) , hence there is no measurement of the parameter @xmath93 . but from the topology of both the magnetic and the velocity fields it is reasonable to suppose @xmath111 , i.e. the width of the wake flow much bigger than that of the current sheet ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "such a high value of @xmath93 is not computationally accessible and on the other hand we have seen in @xcite that the impact of the value of @xmath93 is mainly to change the critical value of @xmath87 below which the dynamics is dominated by the flow .",
    "therefore in this paper we have chosen @xmath112 , which corresponds to a magnetically dominated regime .",
    "this section presents the results of our numerical simulations . in  [ sec : runa ] we show for reference the result of a numerical simulation in which both the melon seed force and the spherical expansion are neglected . in  [ sec : runb ] , in order to show the influence of the expansion on the dynamics of the wake - current sheet system , we present the results of a numerical simulation in which the geometrical expansion is implemented while the melon seed force is neglected . at last , in ",
    "[ sec : runc ] we show the results of a simulation in which both the melon seed force and the spherical expansion are implemented .",
    "if there was no magnetic field ( @xmath113 ) the wake - current sheet system ( equations  ( [ eq : equi1])([eq : equi2 ] ) ) would be unstable for a kelvin - helmholtz - like instability .",
    "two unstable modes exist in this limit : a varicose ( sausage - like ) mode and a sinuous ( kink - like ) mode . the stabilizing effect of a magnetic field parallel to the flow over the kelvin - helmholtz instability is well known ( e.g. @xcite ) , and in fact our linear studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) have found that increasing the value of the alfvn number @xmath87 beyond a critical value the two ideal modes are stabilized . on the other hand",
    "increasing the strength of the magnetic field leads the system to be unstable to a tearing - like instability .",
    "this resistive varicose mode has the same spatial symmetry of the varicose fluid mode and , while in the linear regime the dynamics is not substantially modified by the presence of the flow , developing like a classic tearing instability , in the non - linear regime the presence of the flow has a dramatic influence .",
    "in fact , as the perturbed magnetic and velocity fields attain finite amplitude , the resulting nonlinear stresses along the magnetic island borders @xcite lead to a transfer of momentum between the flow and the magnetic island . as a result",
    "the magnetic island and the central part of the wake are accelerated .",
    "the coupling between magnetic reconnection and kelvin - helmholtz instability that develops in the dynamics of this mode has been studied in @xcite .    in all calculations a small amplitude perturbation of the resistive varicose type ( see @xcite ) at the wavenumber @xmath114 was added to the initial state .",
    "although our numerical code was developed to study the non - linear dynamics , we can estimate ( via a fitting during the linear regime ) the growth rates of the perturbations at various wavenumbers .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the dispersion relation for resistive instabilities obtained with this method .",
    "it is evident from this figure that we have not chosen the fastest growing wavenumber for our nonlinear calculations .",
    "the reason is related to the coupling of the magnetic reconnection instability and of the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "the initiation of the kelvin - helmholtz instability occurs when the resistive instability is well into its nonlinear regime .",
    "the maximum desired value for @xmath38 is limited by the well known fact ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that the kelvin - helmholtz instability is stabilized for wavelengths approaching the thickness of the shear layer ( in our case the amplitude of the wake flow  @xmath79 ) , in this way the wavelengths that give rise to a more efficient acceleration of the wake are the longer ones ( compared to the amplitude of the wake ) .",
    "the minimum desired value for @xmath38 is determined by the number of subharmonics we want to include , to allow for vortex merging .",
    "for this reason , based on the kelvin - helmholtz dynamics , we have picked up the value @xmath115 and not the wavenumber of the fastest growing resistive mode .",
    "a most comprehensive study of this mechanism is underway , in particular a multiwavelength one .",
    "while the numerical computations have been carried out using non - dimensional equations , for a matter of clarity the results will be presented in the ordinary dimensional units .",
    "as in this paper we are interested in studying the time and [ spatial evolution of a parcel of plasma starting from the region immediately beyond the cusp of a helmet streamer , i.e. @xmath116 , we have chosen as characteristic quantities those characterizing this region .",
    "we have chosen as characteristic length the thickness of the wake @xmath117 , as characteristic velocity that of the fast wind @xmath118 , and as characteristic density the current sheet electron density at @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 @xcite . from these quantities we derive the characteristic time @xmath121 .",
    "a particular caution should be taken when considering the times presented in the following simulations .",
    "our numerical simulations have been in fact performed using reynolds numbers values ( @xmath94 ) much lower than coronal values . while most of the nonlinear dynamics is due to ideal processes     averaged in the @xmath35 direction as a function of @xmath36 ( the cross - stream direction ) at selected times .",

    "@xmath122 the linear phase should last approximately 5 hours @xcite .",
    "this time should be added to the times of the simulations presented in the following paragraphs .      in this simulation",
    "we consider neither the expansion nor the diamagnetic force . while the parameters are somewhat different , we reproduce the essential evolutionary features reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] shows the formation and acceleration of density enhanced magnetic islands .",
    "these magnetic islands form with streamwise length equal to the perturbation wavelength .",
    "the magnetic island cross - stream width grows from a small amplitude in the linear regime to the order of @xmath123 , the width of the current sheet , at the beginning of the non - linear stage ( @xmath124 ) . while magnetic reconnection continues to occur in the nonlinear regime ,",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability also is triggered , leading to the acceleration of the central part of the wake ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) up to the value @xmath97 at @xmath125    ) at selected @xmath126 values ( @xmath126 representing the non - expanding numerical grid related to the expanding physical grid @xmath36 by the relation @xmath127 ) as a function of @xmath44 , the distance of the expanding box from the center of the sun.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]        the value of the density enhancement ( @xmath128 defined as the ratio of the maximum density inside the magnetic island over the background density value , steadily increases from an initial uniform value ( @xmath129 ) up to a value which is roughly @xmath130 times greater ( @xmath131 ) at @xmath125 . whereas the formation and evolution of this density enhanced magnetic island is very similar to that of the observed  blobs \" ( i.e. we have a dense , accelerated plasmoid ) , both the density enhancement and the acceleration profile result in larger values than the ones observed ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this has been one of the main reasons to study the more realistic configurations described in the next two sections .",
    "we will show in the next section that when expansion effects are included such a peaked density does not occur because , as expected , while the magnetic island travels outward there is a rarefaction of the island due to the expansion .",
    "this run provides us with information on the effects of the geometrical expansion on the dynamics of the wake - current sheet model for slow solar wind formation and acceleration . in this section",
    "we neglect the diamagnetic force . we will account for this force in the next section .",
    "we used as starting radius @xmath132 , approximately the radius of the region located near the cusp of a helmet streamer . during the time evolution",
    "the radius @xmath44 increases its value up to @xmath133 at @xmath125 . from figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we can clearly notice that while the plasmoid moves outward the box suffers an expansion .",
    "its volume increases as @xmath134 leading to an average decreasing of the mass density as @xmath135 , as the values of the background density @xmath136 indicated in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] show .    the dynamical evolution ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) for the expansion case exhibits some crucial differences from that described in the previous section for the non - expanding case .",
    "again we have the formation of a density enhanced magnetic island , but as now expansion is occurring the average density of matter decreases as @xmath137 , and the density enhancement is lower .",
    "the density enhancement @xmath128 for the selected times shown in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] range between @xmath138 and @xmath4 .",
    "this value is closer , with respect to the non - expanding simulation presented in the previous paragraph , to the observed one , which is of the order of @xmath139 of the background @xmath140 corona @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the transfer of energy to the perturbed fields from the background magnetic and velocity fields depends strongly on the cross - stream gradients of these fields .",
    "on the other hand the expansion of the box implies flow velocities orthogonal to the radial direction which lead to a weakening of these field s gradients @xcite and as a consequence to a lower acceleration profile , shown in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] .    in figure  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] we plot the average streamwise velocity at selected @xmath126 values ( here @xmath126 is the non - expanding numerical grid , related to the expanding physical grid @xmath36 by the relation @xmath127 ) as a function of the distance between the box and the center of the sun , which reaches the value @xmath141 in conventional units , at @xmath142 .",
    "this velocity profile is in good quantitative agreement with the one obtained by observations ( compare with fig .  4 on page  l166 of @xcite ) .      in this section we present the results of a numerical simulation in which both the geometric expansion and the diamagnetic , or melon seed , force are implemented .",
    "as detailed at the end of  [ sec : ge ] the region above the cusp of a helmet streamer is assumed to be in local hydrodynamic equilibrium , therefore gravity , magnetic curvature forces and the flow all balance out .",

    "we compute the value of @xmath144 as the value of the magnetic field at the outer border of the magnetic island .",

    "the main results of the present paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the expanding box generalization of the wake - current sheet model exhibits the formation and outward acceleration of density enhanced magnetic islands .",
    "the plasmoid width , length and acceleration profiles are in good agreement with lasco observations .",
    "2 .   the geometrical expansion by itself has a stabilizing effect on the kelvin - helmholtz instability developed in the non - linear regime .",
    "it also is responsible for a rarefaction of the accelerated plasmoid .",
    "3 .   from our simulations",
    "there is a strong indication that the topology of the magnetic field lines in the region close but beyond the cusp of an helmet streamer is not radially divergent .",
    "this divergence would lead to as yet unobserved acceleration and density profiles due to the diamagnetic force .",
    "note however that other effects ( i.e. drag from the denser current sheets ) might be important as well .    in conclusion ,",
    "these computations reinforce the scenario that the structure and acceleration of the slow solar wind can be attributed primarily to the intrinsic instability and subsequent evolution of the underlying wake - current sheet system . to reproduce the observational details properly ,",
    "further theoretical work and additional solar data are needed . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", we need a study of more complex and realistic basic configurations , where an initial density profile peaked on the current sheet is present , and a non force - free magnetic field is chosen .",
