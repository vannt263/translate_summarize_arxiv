    "we derive the atomic and field dynamics of the double - pass system , confirming their results , and furthermore , showing that the resultant atomic states are spin - squeezed up to 3 db .",
    "we consider an atomic gas in interaction with the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "( our development of the model closely follows the exposition in @xcite , where a single qubit , rather than an atomic gas , is studied ) . as the interaction between the gas and the field is symmetric",
    ", we can characterize the atomic ground state by the collective spin vector @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , assuming that the atoms are strongly spin polarized in the @xmath1 direction , we can apply the holstein - primakoff approximation and introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath2 .",

    "the atomic gas is described by the hilbert space of quadratically integrable functions @xmath5 and the electromagnetic field by the _ symmetric fock space _ @xmath6 over @xmath7 ( hilbert space of single photon wave functions ) , i.e. @xmath8 the fock space @xmath6 allows us to characterize superpositions of field - states with different numbers of photons .",
    "the joint system of the gas and field together is given by the hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "we examine the interaction between the gas and the electromagnetic field in the weak coupling limit @xcite , @xcite , @xcite so that in the interaction picture , the unitary dynamics of the gas and the field together is given by a quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) as described by hudson and parthasarathy @xcite .",
