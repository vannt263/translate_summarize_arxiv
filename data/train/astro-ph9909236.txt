    "recent observations provide strong evidence that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) exist and are the sources that power active galactic nuclei and quasars ( see , e.g. , rees 1998 , for a review and references ) . however , the scenario by which smbhs form is still very uncertain ( see , e.g. , rees 1984 , for an overview ) .",
    "one promising route is the collapse of a supermassive star ( sms ) .",
    "once they form out of primordial gas , sufficiently massive stars will evolve in a quasistationary manner via radiative cooling , slowly contracting until reaching the point of onset of relativistic radial instability . at this point ,",
    "such stars undergo catastrophic collapse on a dynamical timescale , possibly leading to the formation of a smbh ( bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1966 ; zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "because most objects formed in nature have some angular momentum , rotation is likely to play a significant role in the quasistationary evolution , as well as the final collapse of a sms .",
    "the slow contraction of even a slowly rotating sms will likely spin it up to the mass - shedding limit , because such stars are so centrally condensed . at the mass - shedding limit , matter on the equator moves in a keplerian orbit about the star , supported against gravity by centrifugal force and not by an outward pressure gradient .",
    "the sms evolves in a quasistationary manner along the mass - shedding curve , simultaneously emitting radiation , matter and angular momentum until reaching the onset of radial instability .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the luminosity of a uniformly rotating sms as a function of its spin rate , up to the mass - shedding limit .",
    "the magnitude of the luminosity is crucial because it determines the evolutionary timescale of the star as it evolves .",
    "elsewhere we use the result to follow the slow contraction of a cooling , rotating sms to the onset of dynamical instability ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 , hereafter paper ii ) . here , however , we focus on the emitted flux and total integrated luminosity from a stationary sms as a function of its rate of rotation . [ for an overview of previous work on smss and references , see , e.g. , zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; and paper ii . ]    even though our calculation , which is analytic up to quadrature , is rather simple and straight - forward , we have not been able to find a similar argument in the literature .",
    "previous analytical arguments have dealt with more general rotation laws , but they adopt the slow rotation approximation and emphasize gas - pressure atmospheres ( see , e.g. , kippenhahn 1977 ) . while detailed numerical calculations of luminosities of rotating stars have been carried out for select main sequence and massive stars ( see , eg , tassoul 1978 , table 12.1 , and references therein ; langer & heger 1997 ) , we can not find a calculation for a sms .",
    "hence independent of its relevance to the evolution of smss prior to catastrophic collapse , our result may be of interest to stellar modeling of rapidly rotating stars in the limit of very high mass , where our calculation is applicable .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we enumerate and justify our assumptions . in section 3 we briefly review the roche approximation , which we use to describe the outer layers of a rotating sms . in section 4",
    "we derive the flux and luminosity from the star . in section 5",
    "we briefly summarize our results and compare them with previous calculations of rotating main sequence stars .",
    "our analysis relies on several explicit assumptions , all of which we expect to hold to high accuracy in smss .",
    "in particular , we assume that the star is    1 .",
    "dominated by thermal radiation pressure ; 2 .   fully convective",
    "; 3 .   uniformly rotating ; 4 .   characterized by a rosseland mean opacity that is independent of density",
    "governed by newtonian gravitation ; 6 .   described by the roche model in the outer envelope .    for large masses",
    ", the ratio between radiation pressure , @xmath2 , and gas pressure , @xmath3 , satisfies @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 , eqs .",
    "( 17.2.8 ) and  ( 17.3.5 ) ) ; here the coefficient has been evaluated for a composition of pure ionized hydrogen . for stars with @xmath5",
    ", we can therefore neglect the pressure contributions of the plasma in determining the equilibrium profile , even though the plasma may be important for determining the stability of the star ( zeldovich & novikov 1971 ; and shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) . a simple proof that smss are convective in this limit is given in loeb & rasio ( 1994 ) .",
    "this result implies that the photon entropy per baryon , @xmath6 is constant throughout the star , and so therefore is @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the radiation density constant , @xmath9 is the baryon density , and @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant . as a consequence ,",
    "the equation of state of a sms is that of an @xmath11 polytrope : @xmath12^{1/3 } = const,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the pressure , @xmath14 the mass density , @xmath15 the atomic mass unit and @xmath16 the mean molecular weight ( cf .",
    "clayton 1983 , eq .",
    "2 - 289 ; note that clayton adopts a different definition of @xmath17 , which is related to ours by @xmath18 ) .    the third assumption , that the star is uniformly rotating , is probably the most uncertain of our assumptions .",
    "nevertheless , it has been argued that convection and magnetic fields provide an effective turbulent viscosity which dampens differential rotation and brings the star into uniform rotation ( bisnovatyi - kogan , zeldovich & novikov 1967 ; wagoner 1969 ) .    in the high temperature , low density ,",
    "strongly ionized plasma of a sms , thomson scattering off free electrons is the dominant source of opacity .",
    "this opacity is independent of density and justifies our fourth assumption .",
    "we assume that gravitational fields are sufficiently weak so that we can apply newtonian gravity .",
    "smss of interest here have @xmath19 ( see paper ii ) , so that this assumption certainly holds .",
    "relativistic corrections are important for the stability of smss , but can be neglected in the analysis of the equilibrium state .    finally , the roche approximation provides a very accurate description of the envelope of a rotating stellar model with a soft equation of state , as in the case of an @xmath11 polytrope ( for numerical demonstrations , see , eg , papaloizou & whelan 1973 and paper ii ) . since our analysis is based on this approximation , we will briefly review it together with some of its predictions in the following section .    in applications to smss",
    "our analysis neglects electron - positron pairs and klein - nishina corrections to the electron scattering opacity , which is valid for @xmath20 ( see , e.g. , fuller , woosley & weaver , 1986 ) .",
    "stars with soft equations of state are extremely centrally condensed : they have an extended , low density envelope , while the bulk at the mass is concentrated in the core . for an @xmath11 polytrope , for example",
    ", the ratio between central density to average density is @xmath21 .",
    "the gravitational force in the envelope is therefore dominated by the massive core , and it is thus legitimate to neglect the self - gravity of the envelope . in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ", @xmath22 this neglect amounts to approximating the newtonian potential @xmath23 by @xmath24 ( here we adopt gravitational units by setting @xmath25 ) . in  ( [ hydro ] ) we introduce the centrifugal potential @xmath26 , which , for constant angular velocity @xmath27 about the @xmath28-axis , can be written @xmath29 integrating eq .",

    "( [ bernoulli ] ) at the pole yields @xmath33 since @xmath34 on the surface of the star and @xmath35 along the axis of rotation . in the following",
    "we assume that the polar radius @xmath36 of a rotating star is always the same as in the nonrotating case .",
    "this assumption has been shown numerically to be very accurate ( e.g. , papaloizou & whelan 1973 ) .",
    "a rotating star reaches mass shedding when the equator orbits with the kepler frequency . using eqs .",

    "this , of course , is an immediate consequence of hydrostatic equilibrium : at mass shedding , the centrifugal force exactly balances the gravitational force at the equator , so that the pressure gradient vanishes ( eq .  ( [ hydro ] ) ) . for radiation - dominated stars , eq .",

    "obviously , for nonrotating stars with @xmath74 we recover @xmath75 . for maximally rotating stars ,",
    "however , the luminosity is reduced by about 36% : @xmath76 accordingly , adopting the eddington luminosity for a supermassive star that evolves along the mass shedding limit would _ underestimate _ its lifetime by about 36% .",
    "we find that the luminosity of a sms rotating at break - up velocity is reduced by about 36% from the luminosity of a nonrotating sms of the same mass .",
    "it is difficult to compare this result with previous numerical calculations of massive , rotating stars , which are summarized in table 12.1 in tassoul ( 1978 , compare the discussion in kippenhahn 1977 ) .",
    "no calculations seem to have been performed for stellar masses greater than @xmath77 .",
    "the luminosities of these @xmath77 models at break - up velocity are indeed reduced below the nonrotating , spherical luminosities , but only by @xmath78 , much less than what we find . however , the physical conditions in @xmath77 stars are very different from those in smss and do not satisfy our assumptions ( see section 2 ) . for example , at these moderate masses , the stars are not dominated by radiation pressure ; according to eq .  ( [ beta ] ) ,",

    "( [ f_eddington ] ) and  ( [ eddington ] ) would be reduced by a constant factor of @xmath80 , and the luminosity of a rotating star ( eq .  [ lum ] ) would be still be reduced by the same amount below the luminosity of its nonrotating counterpart . ] . also , the total opacity , at least close to the surface of the moderate mass stars considered previously , is no longer dominated by electron scattering and contains nonnegligible contributions from bound - bound and bound - free absorption .",
    "these contributions introduce a dependence on density , so that our assumption 4 no longer holds . more specifically , spinning up",
    "the star may decrease the density in the envelope , therefore decrease the opacity , and hence increase the luminosity .",
    "this would partly compensate for the decrease of the luminosity due to rotation , and will decrease the effect that we find for true smss . finally , we note that moderate mass stars are not fully convective .",
    "our result is important because the luminosity determines the timescale of the evolution and hence the lifetime of smss , which are believed to evolve along a mass - shedding sequence .",
    "this lifetime has been used in several calculations of sms evolution .",
