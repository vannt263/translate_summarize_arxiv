    "it is generally accepted that the massive black - holes ( mbhs ) found in the centres of most galaxies grow via accretion and via mergers following mergers between their host galaxies . however",

    "the seeds could be _ massive _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath4 ) , in which case the first epoch of mergers between galactic black holes at high redshift will generate gravitational waves ( gws ) that could be detected by the future space - borne detector lisa  @xcite",
    ". however , these seeds could also be _ light _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath5 ) and , in that case , the gws generated during these first mergers will be at frequencies between the sensitive bands of lisa and the ground - based instruments currently in operation  ligo , virgo and geo 600  @xcite , or their upgraded advanced versions . in this paper",
    "we show that third - generation ground - based interferometers and second - generation space - based detectors may be able to fill this gap and directly probe the first mergers between light mbh seeds .",
    "light seed black holes might be produced as the remnants of pop iii stars  @xcite .",
    "models including light seeds predict dozens of mbh binary ( mbhb ) coalescences per year in the mass range @xmath6  @xcite . here and elsewhere",
    "we will stretch the definition of mbh to mean any black hole in the centre of a dark matter halo .",
    "these events are mostly at high redshift , @xmath7 , and therefore only events with total mass @xmath8 will be accessible to lisa . to observe systems in the @xmath9 range will require a gw detector sensitive to frequencies in the @xmath10hz range .",
    "this might be achieved in space by second - generation instruments such as the big - bang - observer  @xcite , decigo  @xcite or alia  @xcite , or on the ground by third - generation interferometers . in this paper",
    "we will use decigo as an example of a future space - based detector , and the einstein gravitational - wave telescope ( et )  @xcite as an example of a future ground - based detector .",
    "this choice was motivated by the fact that et is currently undergoing a design study within europe , and a technology demonstration mission for decigo is currently under development in japan .",
    "decigo is a very ambitious mission requiring new technology and so the timescale is rather uncertain , but at present the launch target is @xmath11 .",
    "the timetable for et is also rather uncertain , but construction will start no earlier than @xmath12 .",
    "we will demonstrate that these instruments will have the capability to detect seed black - hole binaries , and we will discuss whether these observations could tell us definitively that we are observing light seeds produced by pop iii stars .",
    "we have already estimated the seed black - hole event rates for et  @xcite as input for the design study , but in this paper we compare and contrast these results with those for decigo , and provide additional details regarding the distribution of the detectable sources and parameter - estimation accuracy .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ methods ] we describe our calculations , including the astrophysical model used to construct the event populations , the waveform models used and the sensitivity curves of the various instruments . in section  [ rates ]",
    "we provide details of the detectable seed black - hole merger events , including the number of events and the mass and redshift distributions of events . in section  [ parest ]",
    "we discuss the parameter estimation accuracy that might be achieved for these systems by a network of third - generation ground - based detectors , before summarizing our conclusions in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "to generate event populations , we trace the galaxy merger hierarchy using monte - carlo merger - tree realisations built on the extended press - schechter formalism  @xcite , using simulations described in detail in  @xcite . in these simulations , dark matter halos are populated with @xmath5 seed black holes at redshift @xmath13 , and it is assumed that these black holes merge as their host halos merge , and accrete mass efficiently . in the present work , we assumed a standard lcdm cosmology with wmap 1-year parameters  @xcite and considered two variants of the pop iii seed model . in both cases",
    ", we used the same merger history for the dark - matter halos and assumed that the seeds accrete at the eddington limit during each merger episode , but the models differed in the initial mass - distribution of the seeds : ( i ) the _ vhm , ems _ ( volonteri - haardt - madau ( vhm ) with equal - mass seeds ) model assumes equal @xmath14 seeds ; ( ii ) the _ vhm , smd _ model ( vhm with seed - mass distribution ) takes the seed - mass distribution to be uniform in log - mass for masses in the range @xmath15 .",
    "we have also studied two further scenarios that differ in the model of accretion onto the seeds , using prescriptions in  @xcite .",
    "results from all four scenarios were considered for the et study in  @xcite , but we now restrict to the two representative models _",
    "vhm , ems _ and _ vhm , smd _ to avoid overloading the figures in this paper .",
    "these models produce event populations that are consistent with observational constraints at @xmath16 from the x - ray and optical quasar luminosity function and from the observed faint x - ray counts of agns  @xcite .",
    "the models predict @xmath17 mbhb coalesences per year in the universe when summed over all black hole masses , but uncertainties in the assumptions of the model could change this by a factor of a few either way .",
    "we are using these models to study black holes at @xmath18 , but they have been tuned to reproduce observations at lower redshift , @xmath19 . indeed ,",
    "accretion onto light black holes may be very inefficient  @xcite , which adds further uncertainties to the picture .",
    "however , we are using these specific models only to indicate the potential of future gw observations as a probe of seed black holes .",
    "our results are not designed to be robust predictions of the event rates given our present limited understanding of the details of the physical processes involved .",
    "we compute signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , @xmath20 , for these sources using the usual expression , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the noise - weighted inner - product @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is the fourier transform of the waveform , and @xmath25 is the one - sided power spectral density of the noise in the detector .",
    "to assess parameter - estimation accuracies , we compute the inverse of the fisher information matrix ( fim ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the model parameters . when considering multiple detectors in a network , the above expressions are still valid if the inner product is replaced by the sum of the inner products over the individual detectors .",
    "to model the gravitational waves generated by mbhb mergers , we use the phenomenological waveform model ( imr ) described in  @xcite .",
    "this waveform model includes the inspiral , merger and ringdown radiation in a consistent way using a prescription of the form @xmath28 expressions for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given in eqs .",
    "( 4.14)-(4.19 ) and tables i - ii of  @xcite . for these sources ,",
    "much of the inspiral is outside of the range of ground - based detectors like et , so it is necessary to include the contributions from merger and ringdown in order to accumulate a significant snr .",
    "the waveforms are functions of the redshifted total mass of the source , @xmath36 , and the symmetric mass ratio , @xmath37 . in the present calculation",
    "we have used the coefficients from the original paper  @xcite , although updated coefficients are available  @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the snrs computed from the two sets of coefficients are nearly identical .    as a check of our results",
    ", we also computed the snr for events using the effective - one - body - numerical - relativity ( eobnr ) waveform family introduced by buonanno et al .",
    "a comparison of the et snrs is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : eobvimr ] .",
    "for comparable mass ratios , @xmath38 , the snrs predicted by the eobnr waveforms are somewhat higher than the imr snrs ( by up to @xmath39 when the merger and ringdown phases dominate the snr ) , while for asymmetric mass ratios , @xmath40 , they tend to be somewhat lower .",
    "however , neither waveform family has been shown to be valid for @xmath41 .",
    "these comparisons give us confidence that the detection - rate estimates quoted here are reasonably trustworthy .     and for two different choices of mass ratio @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",

    "[ f : eobvimr ] , and a `` xylophone '' configuration which trades off sensitivity at higher frequency for improved sensitivity near @xmath2hz and was described in  @xcite . for the snr calculations , we compute sky- and orientation - averaged snrs , which are obtained by computing the snr for an optimally oriented source using eq .",

    "this ensures the sky - averaging for these detectors is done in exactly the same way as the others .",
    "the decigo noise curve is for a single channel of one decigo - like interferometer .",
    "the target decigo design calls for four interferometers , which would enhance the snr by a factor of 2 compared to that in a single interferometer .",
    "the einstein telescope will be a 10 km scale laser - interferometer .",
    "a key target in the et design is the capability to measure polarisation at a single site .",
    "this is achievable by having two coplanar detectors at the site , offset by 45@xmath48 .",
    "the currently favoured design is for a triangular facility containing three 10 km 60@xmath48 detectors , as this has lower facility costs , and we will refer to this as a `` single et '' .",
    "the spectral density shown for both et configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig : noisecurve ] , and which we use in our snr calculations , is for a single right - angle 10 km detector  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivities of two right - angle 10 km detectors and a `` single et '' are factors of @xmath50 and @xmath51 higher , respectively , than that of one right - angle 10 km detector . in section  [ parest ] , we will present estimates of the accuracy with which a network of et - like detectors can measure the parameters of seed black hole mergers . we consider four  third generation network \" configurations  i ) one et at the geographic location of virgo , plus a second right - angle 10 km detector at the location of ligo hanford or perth ( australia ) ; ii ) as configuration ( i ) plus a third 10 km detector at the location of ligo livingston ; iii ) as configuration ( i ) but with the hanford / perth 10 km detector replaced by a second et ; and iv ) three ets , one at each of the sites .     so that they represent equivalent right - angle interferometers.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "in fig .  [ fig : snrvm ] we show how the snr in each of the detectors varies as a function of the redshifted total mass for sources at fixed luminosity distance and for two different values of mass ratio , @xmath52 .",
    "advanced ligo is unsurprisingly beaten at all masses by et , but et and lisa are complementary in that et is more sensitive for @xmath53 , while lisa is better above that mass .",
    "this is advantageous , as these two detectors may well be operating concurrently .",
    "decigo beats every other detector for all masses .",
    "however , this relies on extrapolation of the decigo noise curve over many decades of frequency , and it is not yet clear how valid that extrapolation will be . a less ambitious second generation space - based detector like alia  @xcite would be most sensitive for @xmath54 , but would be beaten by et / lisa below / above that range .",
    "the xylophone configuration significantly improves et s sensitivity for black hole mergers with @xmath55 , as the instrumental noise is significantly reduced at precisely the frequency where most of the snr is accumulated for these systems .",
    "this is very important for the seed black hole event rate .",
    "we note that the snrs of events at redshift @xmath45 will be @xmath56 for et , @xmath57 for lisa and @xmath58 for decigo .    .",
    "all sources are at a fixed luminosity distance of @xmath44gpc.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      to estimate the number of events that each of the detectors would see , we used 1000 merger - tree realisations for each of the two seed black - hole initial mass - distributions described in section  [ methods ] and constructed a catalogue of the merger events that occurred over three years in each case . for each event , we computed the matched filtering snr that would be obtained for that event by each detector , using eq .",
    "( [ snr ] ) . specifying the snr threshold that will be required in the detector for an event to be resolvable then determines the number of events that will be observed .",
    "the event rate is shown as a function of snr threshold in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvthresh ] . for the et configurations the snr threshold is the snr in a single right - angle interferometer with the target sensitivity , and for lisa / decigo it is the snr in a single michelson channel .",
    "the snr threshold that is likely to be required is @xmath59 for the network of detectors , which corresponds to snrs in a single interferometer of 5.3 for a single et , or snrs of 4.8 , 3.9 , 3.8 and 3.1 for the et network configurations ( i)(iv ) described in section  [ detmod ] , or an snr of 5.7 in a single michelson channel of lisa / decigo ( assuming that these instruments can be thought to consist of two independent data channels only ) .",
    "the snr threshold of @xmath60 may be optimistic when other considerations are taken into account , in particular foreground confusion from other gravitational wave sources .",
    "this figure illustrates the sensitivity of the event rate to the threshold that is ultimately required .",
    "advanced ligo is not included in fig .",
    "[ fig : nvthresh ] because it will not detect any events in these astrophysical scenarios .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : nvthresh ] that an et network will detect between a few and a few tens of events , which will be mostly early mergers between light seeds ; lisa will detect several tens of events , which will be mostly mergers between heavier black holes that have already undergone several merger events ; and even a single decigo - like interferometer will provide a complete survey of these events , which is why the decigo curves are flat for all values of the snr threshold shown in the plot .",
    "we note that the et xylophone configuration would detect significantly more seed black hole events at relatively high snr than the broadband et configuration",
    ". this should be an important consideration when final design decisions are made .",
    "we emphasise that these results should not be considered to be robust predictions for the event rates , due to the uncertainties in the astrophysical models , but are designed to illustrate the potential science that these future detectors could do .",
    "the event rate alone does not provide a proper comparison between the different detectors , since it suppresses information about the characteristics of the events . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndm ] we show the mass and redshift distributions of events detected by each instrument for the _ vhm , ems _ and _ vhm , smd _ scenarios .",
    "each curve is normalised so that the integral under the curve is equal to 1 , and the mass distribution is for the intrinsic mass , @xmath61 , not the redshifted mass .",
    "these plots reflect the complementarity of the detectors noted earlier .",
    "lisa and et are almost completely complementary in mass  et / lisa detects events only below / above @xmath62  but probe a comparable range in redshift .",
    "the distribution of decigo events follows the true astrophysical distribution of mergers  most mergers are between @xmath63 black holes in the _ vhm , ems _ scenario , but the mass distribution is quite flat in the _ vhm , smd _ case , in the range @xmath64 . in both cases",
    "the redshift distribution of events is quite flat and extends up to @xmath65 .",
    "if decigo was replaced by alia , then it would not be able to detect the tail of @xmath66 black holes found in the _ vhm , smd _ model , leaving only et able to probe those systems .",
    "et events are predominantly of low mass @xmath67@xmath68 in both configurations and would have redshift @xmath69 if it was operated in the broad band mode ; if et was operated in the xylophone configuration , it would be able to detect mergers out to @xmath70 and indeed would be dominated by events with @xmath71 .",
    "lisa events are predominantly of high mass @xmath72@xmath73 and redshift @xmath69 .",
    "the coalescences detected by lisa are between black holes that have already undergone several merger events , while et probes the earliest mergers between seed black holes .",
    "thus , lisa and et together will probe the full merger history of galaxies in these scenarios .",

    ", et would detect several hundred events rather than several , which our calculations suggest is very optimistic .",
    "the current work should not be taken as a robust calculation of the properties of the events that will be observed by future gravitational - wave detectors , but as an indication of the potential science that these detectors will do .",
    "more work is needed to properly quantify exactly what gravitational - wave observations will tell us about the growth of structure .",
