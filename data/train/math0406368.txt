    "let @xmath0 be a simply connected riemann surface with a @xmath1-smooth metric @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the case when the surface @xmath0 is conformally equivalent to a simply connected planar domain @xmath3 , which we pick to be the unit disk @xmath4 , and the metric @xmath2 is given by @xmath5 for some positive @xmath1-smooth weight function @xmath6 in @xmath3 .",
    "this means that we use _ isothermal coordinates _ , which is basically always possible ; the only real restriction imposed is that we do not allow @xmath0 to be conformally equivalent to the sphere or the plane .",
    "the _ area form _ of the surface @xmath0 is ( with suitable normalization ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the normalized area element in the plane .",
    "the gaussian curvature function associated to the metric @xmath9 given by ( [ metric ] ) is the function @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ( normalized ) laplacian in the plane .",
    "the curvature form associated to the metric @xmath9 given by ( [ metric ] ) is the @xmath13-form @xmath14 defined by @xmath15    in the recent paper @xcite , hedenmalm and perdomo studied the following problem : suppose the curvature form @xmath16 is given and @xmath1-smooth on the closed disk @xmath17 , while the metric @xmath2 is to be found .",
    "if we ask of this metric which we are looking for that it is @xmath1-smooth on @xmath17 and has the _ mean value property _",
    "@xmath18 for all bounded harmonic functions @xmath19 in @xmath20 , can we then find such a metric , and is it unique ?",
    "it turns out that this is indeed so if the condition @xmath21 is met , where @xmath22 denotes the curvature form for the surface @xmath20 when equipped with the ( poincar ) metric of constant curvature @xmath23 : @xmath24 moreover , the result is fairly sharp , in the following sense : if the number @xmath25 is replaced by the slightly larger number @xmath26 in condition ( [ curvaturecond ] ) , the resulting condition is too weak to force the existence of a @xmath1-smooth bordered surface @xmath27 with the mean value property for harmonic functions and the given curvature form @xmath14 .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the numerically obtained number @xmath26 could be replaced by @xmath28 , for any positive @xmath29 .",
    "we shall at times refer to ( [ curvaturecond ] ) as the condition of _ weak hyperbolicity_.    it is a natural question to ask whether there are subdomains @xmath30 , depending on the parameter @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with the modified mean value property @xmath33 for all bounded harmonic functions @xmath19 in @xmath30 .",
    "we make the _ a priori _ assumption that the domains @xmath30 are simply connected with @xmath1-smooth boundaries .",
    "then , if we look at the curvature condition ( [ curvaturecond ] ) and use the fact that the curvature form for the poincar metric decreases as the domain gets smaller , we see that the analogous curvature condition for @xmath34 is fulfilled , so by the hedenmalm - perdomo theorem , the surfaces @xmath35 exist as abstract surfaces , being determined uniquely by the given curvature form and the mean value property ( [ eq - meanvalue - t ] ) .",
    "however , this does not tell us that the abstract surface @xmath35 forms a subregion of @xmath36 . it would be desirable to know that this is so . if this works , then perhaps it will eventually be possible to understand the hedenmalm - perdomo theorem in terms of the following growth process :    \\(1 ) for @xmath31 close to @xmath37 , we form the surface @xmath35 , by fairly elementary means ;    \\(2 ) as @xmath31 increases , we iteratively add abstractly infinitesimally thin boundary layers to the surface @xmath35 , while checking that the curvature condition ( [ curvaturecond ] ) permits us to do so .    here , we shall obtain the existence of the smooth simply connected subdomains @xmath30 of @xmath20 with ( [ eq - meanvalue - t ] ) under the weak hyperbolicity condition ( [ curvaturecond ] ) in the category of _ real - analytic surfaces_. moreover , we shall prove that the boundary curves @xmath38 are real - analytically smooth , and that we get an extra degree of analytic smoothness at the origin for @xmath39 .",
    "the growth of the domains @xmath30 is a certain kind of _ hele - shaw flow _ , modelling the growth of a patch of two - dimensional fluid as fluid is injected at the origin .",
    "we extend the hele - shaw exponential mapping theorem obtained by hedenmalm and shimorin in @xcite to weakly hyperbolic surfaces . from the point of view of differential geometry , it is perhaps surprising that this is possible , because it does not work globally for the ordinary exponential mapping",
    ". after all , it is rather easy to construct a real - analytically smooth surface @xmath40 whose curvature form @xmath16 satisfies ( [ curvaturecond ] ) while two geodesics emanating from the origin meet at some other point ; we supply an example of such a situation in section  [ exwhs ] .",
    "probably this discrepancy can be explained by the viscosity of the fluid as compared with the lack thereof in the photonic gas , which is the physical manifestation of the metric flow .",
    "the techniques used in the paper are basically similar to what was used by hedenmalm - shimorin in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that the green function @xmath41 for the weighted biharmonic operator @xmath42 is used in place of the biharmonic green function @xmath43 .",
    "we suspect that the main results of this paper are false if the constant @xmath25 in the condition ( [ curvaturecond ] ) is replaced by @xmath28 , for any fixed positive @xmath29 . in another vein",
    ", we suspect that the results obtained here for real - analytic surfaces will remain valid for @xmath1-smooth surfaces as well .",

    "the metric disks @xmath259 , @xmath260 , are all precompact in @xmath40 ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  i.10.3 ) ) . in view of theorems",
    "[ simplyconnected ] and [ realanalytic ] , the hele - shaw domains @xmath30 are simply connected with real - analytic jordan curve boundaries for as long as @xmath56 , that is , @xmath261 .",
    "moreover , proposition  [ hsdestimate ] guarantees that the growth of the hele - shaw domains is essentially no faster than that of the metric disks .",
    "the conclusion is that @xmath30 remains precompact in @xmath20 for all @xmath31 , @xmath47 , so that @xmath257 .",
    "in addition , an obstacle problem argument shows that the hele - shaw flow covers all of @xmath0 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "just as in  @xcite , we have the following existence result regarding the so called _ hele - shaw exponential mapping_.    [ hsexpmapping ] let @xmath40 be as in theorem  [ simplyconnected ] .",
    "let @xmath262 .",
    "then there exists a real - analytic mapping @xmath263 such that    * @xmath264 , * each ray @xmath265 is mapped mapped onto a curve in @xmath0 which points in the same direction as the ray at @xmath207 , * the map @xmath89 maps each pair consisting of a concentric circle about the origin and a straight line passing through the origin onto a pair of orthogonal curves , and * for each @xmath266 , the domain @xmath267 equals the hele - shaw domain @xmath268 .",
    "the map @xmath89 is uniquely determined in the class of @xmath269-mappings satisfying the above four properties .",
    "furthermore , the map @xmath89 has the asymptotics @xmath270 if the surface @xmath0 is complete , then @xmath257 , which in turn implies that the hele - shaw flow covers all of @xmath0 , that is , @xmath0 is the union of all the domains @xmath271 over all positive @xmath31 .    using properties of the weighted biharmonic green function @xmath41 we have shown that the hele - shaw flow domain @xmath30 , @xmath56 , is simply connected and has real - analytic jordan boundary ( see section  [ wbhgfcn ] and section  [ simplyconnhsdomain ] ) .",
    "also , in section  [ korenblum ] we showed that @xmath257 if @xmath0 is complete .",
    "knowing this , the proof of theorem  [ hsexpmapping ] proceeds exactly as in  @xcite .",
    "we omit the details .",
    "in this section , we give an example of a complete real - analytic metric ( [ metric ] ) satisfying ( [ curvaturealpha ] ) for a given positive @xmath195 , which , for some @xmath112 , @xmath113 , has the circle @xmath272 as a geodesic curve . by an obvious pull - back with a conformal self - map of the unit disk , we obtain a metric of the kind referred to in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath273 be a bounded interval on the real line @xmath274 .",

    "we now specialize to a radial weight : @xmath279 let @xmath280 be the circle @xmath272 parameterized by @xmath281 for real @xmath31 , @xmath282 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath280 satisfies ( [ geodesiceq ] ) if and only if @xmath283    fix @xmath195 , @xmath196 .",
    "we introduce a positive real parameter @xmath284 , and consider weights of the form @xmath285 by comparison with the poincar metric , it is clear that the metric ( [ metric ] ) so obtained is complete .",
    "since the function @xmath286 is the sum of two logarithmically subharmonic functions , it is itself logarithmically subharmonic ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  1.6.8 ) ) .",
    "this shows that ( [ curvaturealpha ] ) holds .",
    "we now show that the equation ( [ omega0eq ] ) has a solution @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "a computation shows that @xmath287 note that the second term on the right hand side is negative for @xmath288 .",
    "thus , for @xmath284 small and positive , the function @xmath289 attains negative values in @xmath2900,1[$ ] .",
    "taking the endpoints @xmath291 also into account , we see that equation ( [ omega0eq ] ) has at least two solutions @xmath112 in the interval @xmath2900,1[$ ] for small positive values of @xmath284 ."
