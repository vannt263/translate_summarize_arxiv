    "describing polytopes that encode combinatorial problems by means of systems of linear equations and inequalities is a crucial topic in combinatorial optimization , because this approach , known as _ polyhedral combinatorics _ , makes combinatorial optimization problems accessible to linear programming techniques .",
    "while the weyl - minkowski theorem guarantees that for every polytope ( i.e. , the convex hull of a finite set of points ) such a description _ exists _ , it can be quite hard to actually _ find _ some .",
    "sometimes , it is much easier to derive a linear description of some higher dimensional polyhedron that can be projected to the polytope in question by some linear ( or affine ) map .",
    "such a description , known as _ extended formulation _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , can be used instead of the original polytope .",
    "but sometimes , extended formulations can also be exploited in order to find descriptions in the original spaces .    the classical method to do",
    "this is by finding a generating set of the _ projection cone_. in order to explain this , let us look at the ( in fact , not really restrictive ) case of a polytope @xmath0 that is the orthogonal projection @xmath1 of a polyhedron  @xmath2 .",
    "for a description @xmath3 of  @xmath4 by linear inequalities ( with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) , the polyhedral cone @xmath8 is called the _",
    "projection cone_. if  @xmath9 is a finite set of generators of  @xmath10 ( i.e. , every @xmath11 can be written as a linear combination of vectors from  @xmath12 with nonnegative coefficients ) , then @xmath13 is a system of inequalities describing  @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in order to derive a linear description of some polytope from an extended formulation , it is enough to find a finite set of generators of the associated projection cone , e.g. , by determining its extreme rays . in some cases ,",
    "this method has been applied very successfully .",
    "it is worth to note that , while dealing with a projection of a polytope given by linear inequalities is non - trivial ( in general , computing generators of the projection cone is a difficult task ) , the image of a polytope that is given as the convex hull of some set clearly is the convex hull of the projection of that set .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an alternative method for deriving linear descriptions of polytopes from extended formulations that we call the _ lifting method_. actually , the method is not new .",
    "it is , e.g. , a generalization of the method used in  @xcite in order to deduce descriptions of matching polytopes from the descriptions of perfect matching polytopes ( see the proof of cor .",
    "25.1a in  @xcite ) .",
    "our contribution here is meant to first of all draw attention to the method itself ( section  [ sec : lifting example ] ) , to demonstrate its capabilities by providing alternative derivations of well - known linear descriptions ( of path - set polytopes in section  [ sec : path set polytopes ] and of small - cliques polytope in section  [ sec : small clique polytopes ] ) , and finally to use the method in order to derive linear descriptions of a special class of knapsack polytopes , the _ orbisacks _ , which arise in the context of symmetry breaking in integer programming models .",
    "most of the material of this paper can also be found in the phd - dissertation  @xcite .",
    "as an introductory example , we deal with we use the derivation of the linear description of the _ matching polytope _ from the description of the _ perfect matching polytope _",
    "( i.e. , the convex hulls of the characteristic vectors in @xmath15 of all respectively of all perfect matchings in a graph  @xmath16 ) as given in the proof of cor .",
    "25.1a in  @xcite .",
    "we will denote these polytopes by @xmath17\\in\\{0,1\\}^{{\\mathcal{e}}}\\;|\\;{\\mathcal{m } } \\text { matching in } g\\}}\\ ] ] and @xmath18\\in\\{0,1\\}^{{\\mathcal{e}}}\\;|\\;{\\mathcal{m } } \\text { perfect matching in } g\\}}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath19 $ ] denotes the _ characteristic vector _ of the set in the brackets , i.e. , the 0/1-vector having one - entries exactly at positions indexed by that set ) .",
    "we fix by @xmath20 and @xmath21 two disjoint copies of  @xmath22 . for a vertex @xmath23 or a set @xmath24 of vertices of  @xmath22 we denote by  @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the respective copies in  @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the graph @xmath31 arises from  @xmath29 and  @xmath30 by connecting  @xmath25 to  @xmath26 for each  @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that  @xmath32 is the orthogonal projection of  @xmath33 to the @xmath34-coordinates .    in order to describe the method in general ,",
    "let  @xmath35 be a polyhedron whose image under the projection @xmath36 is the polytope  @xmath0 . in our example",
    ", we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for the applicability of the method it is crucial to find a suitably described _ lifting _",
    "@xmath39 on a set @xmath40 containing  @xmath14 with @xmath41 in the matching example , we choose @xmath42 ( where , as usual , we denote by @xmath43 the set of edges incident to  @xmath44 , and , for some vector @xmath45 , by @xmath46 the sum of all components of  @xmath45 indexed by elements from the set in the brackets ) .",
    "actually , the method can only work if the lifting satisfies @xmath47 for all @xmath48 , i.e. , the restriction of the lifting to @xmath14 is a _ section _ of the extension .",
    "however , this property needs not to be established explicitly , but it rather follows in hindsight if the method works out . at this point , the requirement is only used to guide the search for a promising lifting .",
    "for instance , looking at the vertices of @xmath49 one may find @xmath50 with @xmath51 for all @xmath52 and @xmath23 to be a natural choice for the matching example .",
    "suppose we have a linear description of @xmath53 at hand . in order to find a linear description of  @xmath14",
    "it then suffices to exhibit a system @xmath54 of inequalities valid for  @xmath14 that is _ section enforcing _",
    "( with respect to  @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and  @xmath57 ) , i.e. , @xmath47 is satisfied for all @xmath52 with @xmath54 . indeed ,",
    "in this case we clearly have @xmath58 ( as @xmath54 is valid for  @xmath14 ) , and the reverse inclusion follows from @xmath59 for all @xmath52 , @xmath60 for all @xmath52 with @xmath54 , and @xmath61 . in case of the matching example , we can find a section enforcing system of valid inequalities for @xmath37 as follows , exploiting the fact that @xmath38 equals the set of all @xmath62 that satisfy @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath52 and @xmath65 we have @xmath66 as well as   by definition .",
    "thus it remains to identify linear inequalities that are valid for  @xmath49 and imply  . in order to accomplish that task ,",
    "let @xmath67 be any set of odd cardinality , and let @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "we have @xmath70)\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 $ ] are the sets of edges with exactly one end - node in the set in the brackets , one end - node in the first and one in the second set , and both end - nodes in the set , respectively ) and , similarly , @xmath74)$ ] .",
    "hence , holds as soon as @xmath75)\\le \\frac{|{\\mathcal{a}}|-1}{2 }      \\quad\\text{or}\\quad      x({\\mathcal{e}}[{\\mathcal{c}}])\\le \\frac{|{\\mathcal{c}}|-1}{2}\\ ] ] is satisfied .",
    "fortunately , since @xmath76 is odd , @xmath77 or  @xmath78 must be odd , therefore the system @xmath79)\\le\\frac{|{\\mathcal{s}}|-1}{2 }      \\quad\\text{for all } { \\mathcal{s}}\\subseteq { \\mathcal{v } } , |{\\mathcal{v}}|\\text { odd}\\ ] ] is section enforcing and valid for @xmath49 , which establishes @xmath80    as one may see from  , the success of the method crucially depends on the availability of a lifting that is described in a way exploitable for establishing membership in the extension polyhedron . in the matching example , the lifting  @xmath57 was an affine map whose defining formulas could be plugged immediately into the linear description of the extension polyhedron @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , it is not necessary that the lifting is of linear type . in the application to orbisacks in section  [ sec : orbi ] the liftings will indeed be only piecewise affine , and in the two applications worked out in the next two sections the liftings will even not be defined by explicit formulas at all .",
    "as for the matching example , in many cases a fruitful way to come up with a useful lifting seems to be to try to find a natural way to lift the vertices of  @xmath14 into  @xmath4 first , and then to try to define a ( usable description of a ) lifting map on the whole set  @xmath53 extending that lifting of the vertices .",
    "often a lifting of the vertices is rather obvious from combinatorial considerations .",
    "it may also be known already from establishing @xmath81 .",
    "in our second example , we derive a linear description of the @xmath82-@xmath83-path set polytope @xmath84\\in\\{0,1\\}^{{\\mathcal{v}}}\\;|\\;{\\mathcal{p } } \\text { is the node set of some } s\\text{-}t\\text{-path in } d\\}}\\ ] ] of an _ acyclic _ digraph @xmath85 with two nodes @xmath86 , where , for technical reasons , we assume that  @xmath82 is a source of  @xmath87 .",
    "our derivation only reproves a result of vande vate s @xcite , whose proof works via analyzing the projection cone ( phrased in terms of benders cuts ) of basically the same extended formulation as we are going to exploit .    just like",
    "in the matching example , we use an extended formulation based on a directed graph @xmath88 with a node set @xmath89 that contains two clone nodes  now denoted @xmath90 and @xmath91  of each @xmath23 .",

    "( bottom ) obtained from acyclic digraph @xmath87 ( top).[fig : faithful sectioning path polytope extension ] ]    the extension we are going to use is the polytope @xmath94 of circulations in the digraph @xmath95 obeying the following capacities : @xmath96 \\\\",

    "thus we have @xmath99 with  @xmath100 defined via @xmath101 .    in order to define a suitable lifting  @xmath57 , observe that for @xmath102 and @xmath103 we have @xmath104 if and only if @xmath105 holds with  @xmath106 and  @xmath107 being equal to  @xmath108 and  @xmath109 in all components except for @xmath110 for all @xmath111 . consequently ,",

    "one easily finds that these cycles correspond to the cliques of size at most two in  @xmath22 ( where the empty set is induced by the cycle @xmath180 , and each clique of size one or two is induced by two cycles ) .",
