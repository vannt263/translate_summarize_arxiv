    "the x - ray fast transient source igr j16328 - 4726 was discovered by bodaghee et al .",

    "ray transient ( sfxt ) candidate on the basis of the transient and recurrent nature , the spectral properties observed during the outbursts that lasted only a few tens of minutes / hours , the location in the galactic plane , the faint quiescent emission ( @xmath6 ) and a flux dynamic range @xmath7170 in the 0.3 - 10 kev ( xrt / swift ) and @xmath7165 in the 20 - 50 kev ( ibis / integral ) bands .",
    "the source characteristics and behavior are reported in fiocchi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and references therein .",
    "an additional detection was reported in the swift bat 54 month all - sky survey ( cusumano et al .",
    "2010 ) with an averaged flux of @xmath8 in the 15 - 70 kev energy band .",
    "the physical mechanism producing short x - ray flares of the sfxts is still under discussion , and several scenarios have been proposed .",
    "the most frequently discussed scenario is the clumpy stellar wind model ( int zand 2005 ; walter & zurita heras 2007 ) where dense clumps in an isotropic stellar wind cause short x - ray flares when they accrete onto a neutron star .",
    "a few sfxt systems can be explained by an eccentric ns orbit around a massive star with a disk - like anisotropic stellar wind ( sidoli et al .",
    "the sfxt emission could be explained also by a gating effect caused by the extremely strong ns magnetic field ( @xmath9 g ) and rotational properties ( bozzo et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "proximity to the black hole candidate 4u  1630 - 47 , has previously made any periodicity study based on long - term hard x - ray light curves difficult , but corbet et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reported a significant period at @xmath10 days from .",
    "here we report on analysis of _ bepposax _ observations performed in 1998 , a re - analysis of the integral / ibis light curve , and an archival search for other observations that might allow us to confirm or discard the sfxt nature of .",
    "[ fig : lcim ]",
    "the integral dataset used included all public data available for the period up to 30@xmath11 september 2010 ( mjd  52650 through mjd  55469 ) .",
    "the total on - source exposure on during this period was @xmath09.2ms .",
    "light curves for both and 4u  1630 - 47 were extracted from science window ( pointing ) images constructed using the standard osa9 analysis software , in the 18 - 60 kev energy band .",
    "the light curves were then filtered to remove science windows ( scw ) with an exposure of less than 200s and/or in which the sources were at an off - axis angle of greater than 12degrees as such scws have large intrinsic uncertainties in flux measurement .",
    "the final , filtered light curve has an on source exposure of @xmath07.1ms .",
    "we performed a timing analysis on the derived light curve using standard lomb - scargle techniques ( lomb 1986 , scargle 1982 ) to search for periodic signals in the data , and monte - carlo randomisation to determine both the significance of , and uncertainty in , the derived periodicities ( for further information on the randomisation techniques applied see drave et al .",
    "2010 and references thererin ) .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram of the 18@xmath1260kev ibis / isgri light curve of ( figure  [ fig : ibisdata ] , left panel ) shows the detection of a period at 10.068 days , which we interpret as the likely orbital period .",
    "a randomisation monte - carlo determined the 1-sigma uncertainty on that period to be 10.068@xmath130.002days .",
    "this period is consistent , within errors , with that reported in corbet et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and provides an independent confirmation of the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "the detection in that work used a _ swift _",
    "/bat data set spanning mjd  53359 through mjd  55104 .",
    "this data set began after the last period of high x - ray activity in 4u  1630 - 47 ceased at @xmath0mjd  53300 .",
    "integral_/ibis data set used in this work does span the earlier region of high activity of 4u  1630 - 47 .",
    "however there is only a small amount of contamination from this bright source in the light curve and a comparative analysis performed using only data from the same mjd range as corbet et al .",
    "( 2010 ) provided a consistent detection of the period .",
    "the higher exposure in the full data set allowed a more accurate determination of the period and its uncertainty however and thererfore it is this data set that is used in the remainder of this work .",
    "folding the light curve using the best orbital period determination of 10.068days and a zero phase ephemeris , taken as the first _ integral _ observation in the light curve , of mjd 52651.164 yields the folded light curve shown in figure  [ fig : ibisdata ] ( right panel ) .",
    "this shows a single broad emission maximum above a quiescent level , but the statistical quality makes it difficult to derive further information .",
    "the shape of the profile is similar to those observed from other sfxts such as igr  j17544 - 2619 ( clark et al .",

    "the final result is a fully analytic differential psf with a width of 2.5 at 6.4 kev , 80% of encircled energy radius .",
    "since the distance between the black hole 4u 1630 - 47 and igr j16328 - 4726 is @xmath15 , the black hole contribution within the spectral extraction radius of the igr j16328 - 4726 is widely below 1% ( being this the systematic error added to the data following the indications given in fiore , guainazzi & grandi ( 1999 ) for the standard spectral analysis ) .",

    "[ fig : parameters ] , left panel ) .",
    "in particular , we measured a large increase ( factor of @xmath06 - 7 ) in the absorption column density from the lower emission level ( phase l ) up to the peak of the flare ( period g ) when the column density reached a value of @xmath02@xmath110@xmath2  @xmath3 . to test the significance of the measured variation in the absorption column density",

    "a very significant increase in the absorption column density with the unabsorbed fluxes is clearly detected .",
    "although adding an iron line does not significantly improved the fit , we considered this component to estimate the iron line equivalent width upper limits . with the iron line centroid",
    "fixed at 6.5 kev , we obtained equivalent width upper limits of 440 ev and 262 ev ( 3@xmath17 confidence level ) for the peak of the flare ( period g ) and the lower emission level ( phase l ) , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + the continuum spectral model is an absorbed power law .",
    "the @xmath16 is the absorption column density , @xmath18 is the power - law photon index , @xmath19 is the unabsorbed flux in the 1.5 - 10  kev band .",
    "outburst duration is the extrapolated activity period assuming as beginning of the outburst the first bin during which the source was detected while the integration time is the good time interval for the spectral extraction .",
    "+ [ tab : fit3 ]    a time - resolved _ bepposax _ spectral analysis of covering a significant range of orbital phases shows the source x  ray emission could be well described in the different selected time intervals by an absorbed power law model .",
    "while the photon index of the power law remained constant , the absorption column density was highly variable .",
    "we measured a significant rise in the @xmath16 from @xmath03 to 20@xmath110@xmath20  @xmath3 across the transition from the low emission level ( phase l ) to the peak of the flare seen by sax(phase g ) .",
    "we note that this does not correspond to the assumed periastron of the system based on the peak of the folded ibis light curve but is likely associated with the accretion of a well - defined clump of wind .",
    "similar behavior is usually observed during the occurrence of x  ray eclipses in some of the sghmxbs and sfxt ( bozzo et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 ) .",
    "the neutron star could be obscured by its supergiant companion and for this reason the x  ray emission , produced by the accretion close to the surface of the ns , is progressively absorbed in the photosphere of the supergiant star .    with this source being confirmed as an hmxb , its location is possibly associated to the spiral arms of our galaxy , as usually observed with integral hmxb population ( dean et al .",

    "( 2007 , 2011 ) ) . assuming a distance of 3 kpc and 10 kpc for the spiral structure of the galaxy , the x - ray luminosity ( 210 kev ) during the flare spans from 10@xmath21 erg s@xmath22 to 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath22 , respectively . during the low emission level these values spans from 4@xmath110@xmath24 erg s@xmath22 to 4@xmath110@xmath25 erg s@xmath22 .",
    "the x - ray characteristics observed with _ bepposax _ show the frequent micro activity typical of the intermediate state , with a luminosity value lying between the quiescence and the flare peaks , and a soft x  ray spectrum ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "soon after the discovery of sfxt , to explain the bright and short outbursts , int zand ( 2005 ) proposed the sudden accretion of material from the clump wind of the supergiant ; negueruela et al .",
    "( 2006a ) suggested that sfxts orbits should be highly eccentric to explain the low luminosity in quiescence .",
    "later , the idea of a clump and spherically symmetric wind has been associated with an eccentric and/or wide orbit ( walter & zurita heras 2007 ; negueruela et al . 2007 ) . based on the shape of the light curve observed during the 2007 outburst from the sfxt igr  j112155952 displaying periodic outbursts , sidoli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) proposed the presence of a second denser wind component in the form of an equatorial wind disk from the supergiant donor , inclined with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "the flaring activity was explained with a wind that is inhomogeneous and anisotropic .",
    "all models predict that fast x - ray flares can be produced by sporadic capture and accretion onto the neutron stars hosted in the sfxts .",
    "the wind accretion theory allow us to estimate the physical and geometrical parameters of the clumpy responsible of the transient emission .",
    "the duration of the main observed flare during the _ bepposax _ observation of our source ( phase g ) is @xmath274.6  ks , a typical time scale on which the neutron star crosses a dense clumpy . neglecting the orbital velocity of the neutron star as reporting in lpine et al .",
    "2008 , from the duration of the flare we obtain the radius of the clump accreted by the neutron star :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the relative velocity between the clump and the neutron star .    during the time of the neutron stars periastron passage the absorption column density increase",
    "and it could be computed from the equation ( 4 ) given in bozzo et al .",
    "2011 :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the source distance in units of 3  kpc and @xmath32 is the wind velocity in @xmath33 . + using the @xmath16 measured by the spectral analysis at the peak of the flare ( @xmath01.9@xmath110@xmath2  @xmath3 ) and assuming a distance of 3 kpc , eq .",
    "[ eq : nh ] allow us to estimate a wind velocity of @xmath01900  km / s .",
    "this value agrees with the @xmath34-velocity law ( castor et al .",
    "1975 ) which gives a typical velocity of 1000 - 2000 km / s for an ob supergiant and for a companion star losing mass in the form of a steady , homogeneous and spherically symmetric wind .",
    "+ assuming this wind velocity , we found the radius of the clump accreted by the neutron star @xmath35 km . in the framework of the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion theory ,",
    "since only matter within a distance smaller than the accretion radius is accreted , the mass of the clumpy is    @xmath36    where @xmath37=2@xmath38@xmath39/@xmath40 km , @xmath39=1.4@xmath41 and @xmath42 is the mass accreted during the flare .",
    "the x - ray flux extrapolated in 0.1 - 10 kev energy range during the flare @xmath43=@xmath44/(4@xmath45@xmath46)=(@xmath38@xmath39@xmath47/@xmath48)/(4@xmath45@xmath46 ) and the continuity equation @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is the source distance and @xmath48=10  km is the neutron star radius ) allowed to estimate the mass accreted onto the neutron star .",
    "we derived @xmath47=10@xmath51 ( for a distance of 3 kpc ) and m@xmath52 , thus @xmath53 ducci et al .",
    "( 2009 ) computed the expected clumpy characteristics in the framework of the bondi - hoyle accretion theory taking into account the presence of clumps .",
