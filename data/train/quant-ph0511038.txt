    "developing quantum memories constitutes an essential milestone on the route towards quantum communication networks .",
    "as it is difficult to directly store photons , the quantum information has to be stored in a material - based quantum system .",
    "a particularly promising application for polarization - entangled light is the ability to couple it with atomic ensembles : the algebra describing the quantum properties of polarized light _ via _ stokes operators @xcite is exactly the same as that describing the quantum properties of atomic spin be it single or collective spins .",
    "quantum state exchange between light fields and matter systems has been recently experimentally demonstrated @xcite and it has been shown that such systems can be used as quantum memories @xcite .",
    "in addition , from a technical point of view , the use of polarization states offers simpler detection schemes , without the need for local oscillators .",
    "these features make the study and experimental generation of non - classical polarization states of first importance for continuous variable quantum communication .",
    "furthermore , the study of higher dimensional phase space is a fascinating and promising subject .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that multimode non - classical light could be a very powerful tool for an efficient processing and transport of quantum information @xcite . already experimental implementations and applications of such non - classical multimode light have been demonstrated in the continuous - wave regime @xcite .",
    "such systems either involve a very large number of modes @xcite or a much smaller number ( three in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . increasing",
    "the number of correlated modes is of particular importance , for instance in the case of optical read - out technologies @xcite and super - resolution techniques @xcite . in this context",
    ", generating continuous - variable polarization - entangled light @xcite , which exhibits three or four mode correlations , is a first step towards increasing the phase space dimension .",
    "such polarization - entangled beams in the continuous variable regime have been recently produced experimentally with injected type - i phase - matched optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) below threshold @xcite or using @xmath0 effects in a cloud of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "all these methods require linear interferences of two quadrature - entangled modes with two bright coherent states , which limits the amount of entanglement reached and the simplicity and scalability of the setup .",
    "we investigate here a new approach to directly generate polarization - entangled light without the need of mode mixing .",
    "this approach stems from an original device we previously studied , a self - phase - locked optical parametric oscillator .",
    "this system consists of a type - ii phase - matched nonlinear @xmath1 crystal in an optical cavity and emits fields that are phase - locked through linear coupling @xcite : a birefringent plate , which can be rotated relative to the principal axis of the crystal , adds this coupling between the orthogonally polarized signal and idler beams and results in a phase - locking phenomenon that is well - known for coupled mechanical or electrical oscillators @xcite .",
    "such systems have recently attracted a lot of attention as efficient sources of non - classical light @xcite .",
    "stable operation has been demonstrated experimentally even with very small coupling @xcite and their non - classical properties are very encouraging @xcite .",
    "we propose here a new implementation where two crystals , and not only one , are placed with their neutral axis orthogonal in a cavity containing two birefringent waveplates for adjustable linear coupling . each crystal generates a pair of signal and idler beams and the waveplates couple together the two signal beams and the two idler beams so that phase locking can be achieved in a non - frequency degenerate operation . as we will show below , this device allows for a direct and efficient generation of polarization - entangled optical beams .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate in detail the classical and quantum properties of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we begin by presenting the linear and non - linear elements of the two - crystal opo . a propagating jones matrix is associated to each elements and permits to access the round - trip matrix and the stationary solutions .",
    "section [ sec3 ] considers the quantum properties of the emitted beams in terms of quadrature operators in the fourier domain .",
    "the usual input - output linearization technique is used and quantum correlation spectra are formulated .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] , these quadrature correlations are then interpreted in terms of polarization - entanglement through the stokes operators . considering various criteria ,",
    "we demonstrate theoretically that this device is an efficient source of polarization - entanglement .",
    "in this section , we present the basic scheme of the two - crystal opo . round - trip equations and stationary solutions",
    "are then derived by using jones matrix formalism .",
    "the setup is sketched in fig .",

    "birefringent waveplates are inserted inside a ring cavity .",

    "the orientation of the various axes with respect to one another are critical .",
    "they are summarized on fig .",
    "[ fig : cavite ] :    * the nonlinear crystals @xmath3 and @xmath4 have their fast axes orthogonal ; * waveplate @xmath5 has its fast axis parallel to the fast axis of the crystal @xmath3 ; * the fast axis of the waveplate @xmath6 makes an angle @xmath7 with respect to the fast axis of crystal @xmath4 . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to small values of @xmath7 .",
    "four fields may propagate inside the cavity : their classical field amplitudes are denoted @xmath8 and @xmath9 where the index corresponds to the polarization and the letter to the frequency @xmath10 or @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cavite ] ) .",
    "the pump field is polarized at 45@xmath12 of the crystals axes and its amplitude is denoted @xmath13 .",
    "we consider that the pump and subharmonic fields are coupled via the nonlinear crystals . in @xmath3 ,",
    "the phase matching is such that @xmath14 is coupled to @xmath15 and @xmath16 while in @xmath4 , @xmath17 is coupled to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we suppose that the waveplates for the sub - harmonic waves have identical dephasing for the two fields . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are highly reflective mirrors while the amplitude reflection coefficient for @xmath22 is denoted @xmath23 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", this coefficient is assumed to be real and independent of the frequency and of the polarization .",
    "birefringent elements are usually described by jones matrices @xcite .",
    "the total field can be decomposed into four components corresponding to the two sub - harmonic frequencies and the two linear polarizations .",
    "the waveplates @xmath5 and @xmath6 couple the fields @xmath15 and @xmath18 , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 independently while the crystals couple @xmath15 and @xmath25 , and @xmath18 and @xmath24 independently .",
    "thus , the basis @xmath26 is sufficient .",
    "the waveplate @xmath5 is a @xmath27 with its axes parallel to the basis axes so that its associated matrix is diagonal :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 denotes the wave vectors , @xmath30 the mean index of refraction ( dispersion is neglected ) and @xmath31 the thickness of the plate .    to determine the transfer matrix of the nonlinear crystals",
    ", the phase - matching will be taken perfect .",
    "we recall that the field amplitudes at the output of the first crystal can be written @xmath32 to the first order in @xmath33 where @xmath14 denotes the pump amplitude at the output of the first crystal , @xmath34 and where @xmath33 is the nonlinear coupling coefficient given by @xmath35 equations [ eq2 ] are only valid close to the oscillation threshold where the pump depletion is small , which corresponds to the usual operation regime of such non - linear devices in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix of the first crystal takes thus the following form : @xmath36 as stated before , perfect phase - matching has been assumed .",

    "the transfer matrix is found to be @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    as mentioned earlier , we assume that the mirror properties are independent both of the frequency and of the polarization .",
    "the free propagation matrix is thus @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the cavity length without taking into account the birefringent elements ( waveplates and crystal ) .",
    "one can now calculate the round - trip matrix : @xmath47 rather than giving the round - trip matrix in the general case , let us now make the following assumptions which are usually verified experimentally :    * the finesse for the subharmonic fields is high .",

    "we denote @xmath52 their small round - trip phase detunings . * the waveplates @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath27 for the two frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    in this case",
    ", the round - trip matrix to the first order in @xmath53 and @xmath54 takes the following form : @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the phase of the pump amplitude between the two crystals has been shifted by @xmath57 .",
    "the stationarity of the solutions corresponds to the fact that the field amplitudes after one round trip must be equal to the initial ones .",
    "this condition can be expressed in terms of the round - trip matrix : @xmath58 this system has a non - trivial solution only if @xmath59 which leads to a stringent condition on the dephasings @xmath60 and provides also an expression for the pump power @xmath61 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath62 $ ] , which corresponds to the lowest threshold area .",
    "eq [ eq : det=0 ] yields to : @xmath63 this equation has two solutions , corresponding to two possible regimes . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the regime of lower threshold .",
    "these equations are similar to that obtained in a one - crystal self - phase locked opo , which has been studied in detail in @xcite . for a given input pump intensity , the phase - locked operation can be obtained only for a given range of the relevant parameters ( _ i.e _ cavity length and crystal temperature ) which defines a so - called `` locking zone '' .",
    "this locking zone is typically a cavity resonance width large in terms of length and a few kelvins in terms of temperature , well within experimental capacities . for a one - crystal self - phase",
    "locked opo , phase - locked operation was indeed observed even for extremely small angles of the wave plate @xcite where it does not perturb the quantum properties of the system @xcite .",
    "let us consider the lowest threshold given by eq .",
    "[ condstat ] and reached for @xmath64 .",
    "this working point , associated with @xmath62 $ ] , can be obtained experimentally by simultaneously adjusting both the crystal temperatures and the frequency of the pump laser .",
    "equation [ condstat ] becomes thus : @xmath65 at this working point , the round - trip matrix is simpler and can be rewritten : @xmath66    the eigenvector of the round - trip equation , @xmath67 , is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a ( _ a priori _ complex ) constant .",
    "this expression shows that the field generated consists in two modes at frequencies @xmath10 and @xmath11 with right circularly polarization .",
    "@xmath69 is determined by the pump depletion equation : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the input pump amplitude . in order to solve this equation",
    ", one can set the pump phase between the two crystals to be zero : this amounts to changing the phase origin which will not change the properties of the system .",
    "the previous equation yields @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "one then gets the usual opo solution @xmath74 where a reduced pumping parameter @xmath75 has been defined equal to the input pump amplitude normalized to the threshold @xmath76    when @xmath75 is larger than 1 , i.e. when the opo is pumped above a defined threshold , four bright beams with fixed relative phases given by eq .",
    "[ eq : solstatchamps ] are generated . since the two signal ( resp .",
    "idler ) beams have a fixed phase relation and identical frequencies , they form a single beam with a circular polarization state .",
    "the system thus generates two circularly polarized beams which are frequency tunable .",
    "the next sections are devoted to the study of the quantum properties .",
    "correlations and anticorrelations of the couple signal / idler emitted by each crystal , i.e. @xmath77 or @xmath78 , are formulated .",
    "in order to calculate the fluctuations for the involved fields when the system is pumped above threshold , we apply the usual input - output linearization technique ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite ) .",
    "individual noise spectra as well as the correlations between any linear combinations of the various fluctuations are derived in the fourier domain .",
    "we first determine the classical stationary solutions of the evolution equations : these solutions are denoted @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "we then linearize the evolution equations around these stationary values by setting  : @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the evolution equations for the fluctuations are deduced from the round - trip matrix taking into account the stationary solutions [ eq : solstatpompe],[eq : solstatchamps],[eq : solstatv ] :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 stands for the cavity round - trip time . @xmath85",
    "correspond to the vacuum fluctuations entering the cavity through the coupling mirror .",
    "we define the amplitude and phase quadratures of a mode @xmath86 with mean phase @xmath87 by respectively @xmath88 the evolution equations can be then expressed in matrix form  : @xmath89 where    @xmath90    @xmath91 is the column vector of the quadrature components @xmath92 @xmath93 for the input pump fluctuations , @xmath94 and @xmath95 the for the vacuum fluctuations entering the cavity through the coupling mirror @xmath96    these differential equations are readily transformed into algebraic equations by taking the fourier transform . in the frequency domain ,",
    "the equations become @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the noise frequency normalized to the cavity bandwidth @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the normalized coupling constant .",
    "@xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the fourier transforms of the column vectors [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .",
    "the matrix @xmath104 is defined by @xmath105      in order to use the symmetry of the equations , one can introduce the symmetric and antisymmetric components @xmath106 and @xmath107 in a standard opo , one expects intensity correlations and phase anti - correlations . using our notations , this corresponds to having @xmath108 and @xmath109 as well as @xmath110 and @xmath111 squeezed @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in a phase - locked opo in the limit of small coupling @xcite .    as previously , the equations verified by these quantities can be expressed in matrix form .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the sums are independent from the differences .",
    "thus , one can write two sets of equations : @xmath112 where @xmath113 are the column vector @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 are the column vectors for the input pump fluctuations , @xmath117 and @xmath118 the column vector for the input fluctuations entering the cavity through the coupling mirror @xmath119    these equations can be easily solved and one obtains the equations for the intracavity fluctuations .",
    "however , the relevant fluctuations are those outside the cavity",
    ". they can be easily calculated using the boundary condition on the output mirror : @xmath120 and the corresponding spectra are given by @xmath121 the expressions are identical for the two sets of spectra @xmath122 and @xmath123 :    @xmath124    @xmath125 .    the behavior of the squeezed spectra , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , is shown on figure [ fig : spectre_rq ] . for small coupling and low analysis frequency , one observes that the spectra go to zero which indicates the existence of very large correlations . as usual ,",
    "the spectra go to one as @xmath128 goes to infinity : the correlations exist only within the cavity bandwidth or conversely , only when the integration time is larger than the field life time in the cavity .",
    "the increase of @xmath129 also results in a degradation of the correlations and anti - correlations : the wave - plate tends to mix the fields , and this phenomenon is increased as the coupling is increased .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in terms of phase diffusion : as the coupling is increased , the phase diffusion is reduced which in turn reduces the intensity correlations . finally , the phase anticorrelations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre_rq ] , left ) are also degraded as the input pump power is increased : as @xmath75 is increased , the input pump noise becomes more and more important .",
    "this analysis has been performed by studying the fields generated by each crystal .",
    "since several frequencies are involved , such a measurement would require the use of multiple local oscillators or of dephasing cavities @xcite .",
    "it is thus easier experimentally as well as more fruitful for quantum information purposes to study the beams at each frequency , namely the couples @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which are circularly polarized .",
    "the non - classical properties of the two - crystal opo are now analyzed in terms of polarization fluctuations .",
    "polarization entanglement generation is demonstrated using various criteria introduced in the literature .      before describing the properties of the system ,",
    "let us briefly recall the quantum picture for polarization properties .",
    "the polarization of light beams can be described in the general case by the stokes parameters @xcite : @xmath132 where @xmath133 describe the intensity along the @xmath134 , @xmath40 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 polarization .",
    "these four parameters are not independent but are instead linked by the relation @xmath139 for a totally polarized field .",
    "the quantum polarization properties are defined via the quantum counter - parts of the stokes parameters @xcite : @xmath140 @xmath141 verify commutation relations identical to those verified by orbital momentum operators : @xmath142 = 2 i   \\hat s_k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 are cyclically interchangeable .",
    "these relations result in three uncertainty relations , @xmath144 where the notation @xmath145 correspond to the variance of the operator @xmath146 .      in our case , eq . [ eq : solstatchamps ] shows that the output beams are circularly polarized , thus @xmath147 .",
    "it results that the inequalities [ eq : heisenberg stokes ] which contain variances @xmath148 are automatically verified . the only non - trivial heisenberg inequality is then given by @xmath149 where the notation @xmath145 correspond to the variance of the operator @xmath146 : @xmath150 .",
    "various entanglement criteria have been defined .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to three of them @xcite .",
    "the first two criteria are , in the general case , sufficient ( and not always necessary ) conditions for entanglement . a general criterion is given by the product of two linear combinations of conjugate variables variances @xcite ( denoted `` product criterion '' in the following ) . in the case of the stokes",
    "operators , this inseparability criterion states that when @xmath151 the state is entangled . the relevant stokes parameters fluctuations , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , can be expressed from the quadrature operators . in the case of",
    "circularly polarized beams , one has ( @xmath154 ) @xmath155 it follows from these expressions that :    @xmath156    thus the relevant spectra can be calculated from the previously calculated linear combinations of the amplitude and phase quadrature components .",
    "they are given by :    @xmath157 ^ 2 + \\omega^2 - 2 \\left[c^2 - \\sigma ( \\sigma-1)\\right ] \\omega^2",
    "+ \\omega^4}. \\label{eq : s2moins}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        let us remark that the two expressions are equal for @xmath158 and @xmath159 , _ i.e. _ for the uncoupled system operated at threshold .",
    "one also remarks that @xmath160 is independent of the pump amplitude , @xmath75 .",
    "this is not surprising since this quantity is the difference of the intensity correlations between the signal and idler modes of each crystal .",
    "these correlations originates in the parametric down - conversion phenomenon , independently of the pump power : the photons in the modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively ) are emitted by pairs thus leading to intensity correlations between the two modes .",
    "these two quantities can be measured using standard methods for the measurement of quantum stokes operators , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite    using these expressions , one gets a simple expression for the product criterion [ eq : mancini ] @xmath161    the second criterion ( `` sum criterion '' ) , which is widely used in continuous - variable entanglement characterization , is given by the sum of the above quantities @xcite .",
    "it is in fact a special case of the previous criterion @xcite .",
    "the criterion states that if @xmath162 then the two states are entangled .",
    "these two criteria are entanglement witnesses in the sense that they allow to specify whether the state is indeed entangled .",
    "finally , the last criterion is related to another particularity of the system which may allow to make a joint qnd measurement of the two non - commutating observables @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this is related to epr - like `` paradox '' .",
    "this criterion relies on conditional probabilities and can be written @xmath165 where @xmath166 when this condition is verified , the correlations are sufficiently large that the information extracted from the measurement of the two stokes operators of one field provides values for the stokes operators of the other which violate the heisenberg inequality @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : criteres ] shows the various criteria as a function of the analysis frequency , @xmath128 for a fixed pump power ( @xmath167 ) and for different values of the coupling .",
    "very strong entanglement can be found for small couplings , @xmath129 and small analysis frequencies , @xmath128 . as the coupling is increased ,",
    "the entanglement is shifted to higher values of the analysis frequency .",
    "let us note however that @xmath168 corresponds usually to large angles ( around 1@xmath12 for typical output couplers ) : in the case of single crystal phase locked opos , stable phase - locking has been achieved with very small angles corresponding to @xmath169 . the entanglement is present for a wide range of the parameters thus showing the efficiency of the system .",
    "we have presented and studied theoretically an original device based on an optical cavity containing two type - ii phase - matched @xmath1 crystals as well as birefringent plates which add a linear coupling between the signal and idler fields emitted in each crystal .",
    "the coupling induces a phase - locking respectively between the two signal fields and between the two idler fields . in this configuration ,",
    "the system is found to directly generate two - color polarization - entangled beams without the need for mode mixing .",
    "the two - crystal opo would be thus a useful resource for the field of continuous - variable quantum information .",
    "non - classical polarization states are well coupled to atomic ensembles which can be used as quantum memories and form the basic block required for quantum networks .",
