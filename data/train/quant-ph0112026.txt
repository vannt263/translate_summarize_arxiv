    "it has been shown that , a quantum computer , if available , can perform certain tasks much more efficiently than a classical turing machine@xcite .",
    "the realization of the basic constitute of quantum computer , fault tolerate quantum logic gate , is a certral issue in the subject .",
    "one can make a fault tolerate quantum computation through the quantum error correction .",
    "it has been pointed out that , if the error rate of each operation is smaller than certain threshold , the error correction method works for arbitrary large scale computation .",
    "the threshold is estimated to be @xmath1 .",
    "recently , it is proposed@xcite to implement the the quantum gate by super conducting interference device(squid ) .",
    "the single qubit operation has been experimentally demonstrated in ref@xcite .",
    "this implementation has a unumber of advantages .",
    "one can address the single qubit ( josephson junction ) instead of the bulk material in nmr .",
    "one can even control the interaction between the two qubit system through the external parameters ( voltages and magnetic flux ) .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the josephson junction is not a two level system .",
    "only when we choose certain specific parameters we can approximately have a two level computational subspace . in general there is a small transition probability between the computational spapce and the outside space , this causes the leakage@xcite .",
    "the leakage error can be minimized by the specifically designed farbrication@xcite . also , one may detect and correct the leakage error by taking the meassurement on the space outside computational space .",
    "besides the leakage , the approximate effective hamiltonian causes another type of error , the phase shift error .",
    "if the rate of all accumulatable errors are lower than certain threshold@xcite , a large reliable quantum computation can be done , in principle . because in such cases we can always take certain appropriate error correction procedure to reduce the error exponentially@xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyse the phase shift error caused by the approximate effective hamiltonian .",
    "we give a new effective hamiltonian through the purtabation method . using this new effective hamiltonian ,",
    "the phase shift error rate is lower than the quantum computation threshold@xcite .",
    "consider a superconducting electron box formed by a @xmath2 squid ( see fig .",
    "[ jo ] ) , pieced by a magnetic flux @xmath3 and with an applied gate voltage @xmath4 .",
    "the device is operated in the charging regime , i.e. , the josephson couplings @xmath5 are much smaller than the charging energy @xmath6 . also a temperature much lower than the josephson coupling",
    "is assumed .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is@xcite @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath6 is the charging energy and @xmath9 can be tuned by the applied voltage @xmath4 through @xmath10 ( see figure [ jo ] ) .",
    "the phase difference across the junction @xmath11 and the cooper pair number @xmath12 canonical conjugate variables @xmath13=i.$ ] @xmath14 is the quantum of flux .",
    "so here @xmath9 and @xmath3 can be tuned externally .",
    "if the value of parameter @xmath9 is close to @xmath15 , the energy gap between the ground state @xmath16 and the first excited state @xmath17 is much smaller than the gaps among any other states .",
    "thus the basis @xmath18 approximately make a computational subspace .",
    "the transition between the states in the subspace and the state outside the subspace is small.through calculation of the matrix element i.e. , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , the matrix form of the hamiltonian @xmath21 in the subspace @xmath22 is @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are pauli matrices .",

    "we can take the rotating operation throhgh the time ecolution property of this effective hamiltonian @xmath26",
    ".    however , this @xmath26 may not be the best choice in simulating the real time evolution . to reduce the systematic error , one can use another form of the effective hamiltonian which simulates the time evolution in the computational subspace more precisely . in this paper , we calculate the matrix element @xmath27 by the purterbation expansion . we know",
    "the time evolution operator generated by @xmath21 can be expressed in the form @xmath28 , we still have difficulty in obtaining the precise time evolution properties for state @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are eigenvalue and eigenstate of @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 can be expressed in mathieu function , which is the infinite summation of trignometric functions .",
    "but in the real calculation , we have to use the truncated mathieu function .",
    "as we will show it latter , after taking the first non - zero perturbation term into consideration , the error is much smaller than the threshold for fault resilent quantum computation@xcite . in the following sections , after the we study the single qubit case by the perpurbation method",
    ", we will investigate the two qubit dynamics , which is the heart of the elementary quantum logic device .",
    "we will study both the capasitively coupled squids and the inductively coupled squids .",
    "for the former one , we find the effective hamiltonian in the subspace works exactly .",
    "for the latter one , we give a new form for the effective hamiltonian so that it works more precisely in the computational subspace , especially , the error rate is much lower than the threshold for a large , reliable quantum computation .",
    "we first write the hamiltonian @xmath21 in the following equivalent form @xmath31 furthermore , we decompose the hamiltonian into two parts as @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 we regard this @xmath35 as the perbation term . @xmath36",
    "part can be solved exactly .",
    "the first two eigenvalues(@xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and first two eigenstates(@xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are just that of @xmath26 .",

    "they have already been denoted as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . if we ignore @xmath35 , this @xmath36 is identitical to @xmath26 in the subspace of @xmath22 .",
    "the perturbation mordification comes from @xmath35 .",
    "we do the perturbation calculation to the second order of for the eigenvalues and to the first order to eigenstates here .",
    "( for more exact result , one can do it similarly through higher order approximation . )",
    "we heve the following results : @xmath44 @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 take the perturbation result above into consideration , we obtain the time evolution operator in the computational subspace @xmath48 therefore , the new effective hamiltonian with this timeevolution property is @xmath49 this new effective hamiltonian gives the evolution operator as eq .",
    "( [ evo ] ) .",
    "if @xmath9 is close to @xmath15 , the modification in the effective hamiltonian is insigficant .",
    "especially , if @xmath50 , @xmath51 is same with @xmath26 , up to a constant term .",
    "but they may differ obviously when @xmath9 is far from @xmath15 . with this new effective hamiltonian , if we omit the leakage error , the distance between the state under real time evolution@xmath52 and the state given by evolution of eq .",
    "( [ evo ] ) @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath54 . typically , if @xmath55 , the error is is between @xmath56 to @xmath57 , smaller than the threshold for resilent quantum computation , @xmath1 to @xmath58@xcite .",
    "however , if we use the old effective hamiltonian which is the first order perturbation in the computational subspace , the error rate is in the magnitude order of @xmath59 , larger than the threshold .",
    "however , the error rate can be larger than this threshold if we use the old effective hamiltonian @xmath26 , provided that @xmath9 is far from @xmath15 . if the value @xmath60 is not so small in certain case , we can take a higher order purterbation calculation .",
    "for the capasitively coupled squid , the interacting hamiltonian is @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "now we regard qubit 1 as the comtroll bit and qubit 2 as the target bit .",
    "our goal is to make a conditional flip to qubit 2 , i.e. , if state of qubit 1 is @xmath16 , nothing happens to qubit 2 ; if state of qubit 1 is @xmath17 , then qubit 2 is flipped . to make the c - not gate , we set @xmath63 to @xmath64 and @xmath65 for qubit 1 .",
    "for qubit 2 we set the magnetic flux @xmath66 so that @xmath67 ; and @xmath68 . just wait for a period of @xmath69 we obtain the following conditional unitary transformation for qubit 2 @xmath70 if state of qubit 1 is @xmath16 ; and @xmath71 if state of qubit 1 is @xmath17 .",
    "this is equivalent to c - not gate through hardmard transformation . since @xmath72 is set to 0 here , so the above two qubits operation is exact . thus _",
    "if we use the capasitively coupled squids , there is no phase shift or leakage error caused by the the states outside the computational subspace in the two qubits operation .",
    "_      the c - not gate of inductively coupled squid system is given in @xcite by using the effective hamiltonian in the computational system .",
    "here we use the time evolution operator in the whole system and then to calculate the time @xmath73 at which the fidelity between time evolution operator and a c - not matrix has the maximum value .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two interacting squids is @xmath74 we know @xmath75 .",

    "in the two qubit operation , we can always set @xmath82 .",
    "thus @xmath26 is simplified to @xmath83 . under this condition",
    "we have @xmath84 where we have used the basis of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath87 we can obtain the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath79 exactly .",
