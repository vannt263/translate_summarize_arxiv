    "since telatar s @xcite and foschini s @xcite pioneering works predicting the potential of high spectral efficiency provided by multiple antenna systems , the last decade has witnessed a soar of research activity on multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technologies .",
    "the benefits of substantial improvements in wireless link capacity at no cost of additional spectrum and power have quickly positioned mimo as one of the breakthrough technologies in modern wireless communications , rendering it as an enabling technology for next generation wireless networks . however , applying mimo in wireless mesh networks ( wmns ) is not a trivial technical extension . with the increased number of antennas at each node ,",
    "interference is likely to become stronger if power level at each node , power allocation to each antenna element , and routing are not managed wisely . as a result ,",
    "cross - layer design is necessary for mimo - based wmns .    in a mimo - based wmn",
    ", the set of outgoing links from a node sharing a common communication spectrum can be modeled as a nondegraded gaussian vector broadcast channel , for which the capacity region is notoriously hard to analyze @xcite . in the networking literature ,",
    "most works considering links sharing a common communication spectrum are concerned with how to allocate frequency sub - bands / time - slots and schedule transmissions to efficiently share the common communication spectrum . as an example ,",
    "[ fig_tdm ] shows a simple broadcast channel where there are three uncoordinated users and a single transmitting node .",
    "suppose that messages @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 need to be delivered to user 1 , user 2 , and user 3 , respectively .",
    "also , suppose that the received signals subject to ambient noise are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , and the decoding functions are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the conventional strategy is to divide a unit time frame into three time slots ( or divide a unit band into three sub - bands ) @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , and then find the optimal scheduling for transmissions to users 1 , 2 and 3 , accordingly .",
    "the major benefit of this strategy is that interference can be eliminated",
    ".    although the time or frequency division schemes are simple and effective , they are not necessarily the smartest strategy .",
    "in fact , cover had shown in his classical paper @xcite that the transmission scheme _",
    "jointly _ encoding all receivers information at the transmitter can do strictly better in broadcast channels .",
    "however , the capacity achieving transmission signaling scheme for general nondegraded gaussian vector broadcast channels is very difficult to determine and has become one of the most basic questions in network information theory @xcite .",
    "very recently , significant progress has been made in this area .",
    "most notably , weigarten _ et .",
    "al . _ finally proved the long - open conjecture that the `` dirty paper coding '' strategy ( dpc ) @xcite is the optimal transmission scheme for gaussian vector broadcast channels @xcite in the sense that the dpc rate region @xmath13 of a broadcast channel is equal to the broadcast channel s capacity region @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "however , this fundamental result is still not adequately exposed to the networking research community .",
    "so far , how to exploit dpc s benefits in the cross - layer design for wireless mesh networks has not yet been studied in the literature .",
    "the main objective of this study is to fill this gap and to obtain a rigorous and systematic understanding of the impact of applying dpc to the cross - layer optimization for mimo - based mesh networks .    to begin with ,",
    "it is beneficial to introduce the basic idea of dpc , which turns out to be very simple . for the same 3-user example , consider the following strategy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dpc ] .",
    "we first jointly encode the messages for all the users in a certain order and then broadcast the resulting codeword _",
    "suppose that we pick user 1 to be encoded first , then followed by user 2 , and finally user 3 .",
    "we choose the codeword @xmath1 for user 1 as before .",
    "then , the interference seen by user 2 due to user 1 ( denoted by @xmath16 ) is known at the transmitter .",
    "so , the transmitter can subtract the interference and encode user 2 as @xmath17 rather than @xmath2 itself . as a result",
    ", user 2 does not see any interference from the signal intended for user 1 .",
    "likewise , after encoding user 2 , the interferences seen by user 3 due to user 1 and 2 ( denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) are known at the transmitter .",
    "then , the transmitter can subtract the interferences and encode user 3 as @xmath20 rather than @xmath3 itself .",
    "therefore , user 3 does not see any interferences from the signals intended for user 1 and 2 . in the end",
    ", the transmitter adds all the codewords together and broadcasts the sum to all users simultaneously . as a result , it is easy to see from fig .",
    "[ fig_dpc ] that the received signal at user 1 is @xmath21 , i.e. , user 1 will experience the interference from the signals intended for users 2 and 3 ; the received signal at user 2 is @xmath22 , i.e. , user 2 only experiences the interference from the signal intended for user 3 ; and finally , the received signal at user 3 is @xmath6 , i.e. , user 3 does _ not _ experience any interference .",
    "this process operates like writing on a dirty paper , hence the name .",
    "although counterintuitive , the capacity region of dpc that allows interference is strictly larger than those of time or frequency division schemes .",
    "after understanding what dpc is , one may ask two very natural and interesting questions :    1 .",
    "_ how will the enlarged capacity region at each node due to dpc impact the network performance in the upper layers ? _ 2 .",
    "_ are there any new challenges if dpc is employed in a mimo - based networking environment ? _    notice that , when dpc is employed , the encoding order plays a critical role .",
    "for a @xmath23-user broadcast channel , there exists @xmath24 permutations . also , since dpc allows interference among the users , power allocation among different users along with the encoding order has a significant impact on the system performance .",
    "as we show later , the dpc link rates in a broadcast channel are non - connvex functions .",
    "thus , even the optimization for a single @xmath23-user gaussian vector broadcast channel is a very challenging _ combinatorial non - convex _ problem , not to mention the cross - layer design in a networking environment with multiple broadcast channels .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to solve the problem of jointly optimizing dpc per - antenna power allocation at each node in the link layer and multihop / multipath routing in a mimo - based wmn .",
    "our contributions are three - fold .",
    "first , this paper is the first work that studies the impacts of applying dpc to the cross - layer design for mimo - based wmns . in our numerical example",
    ", it is shown that we can achieve a network performance gain of @xmath0 by using dpc in mimo - based wmns .",
    "also , since the traditional single - antenna systems can be viewed as a special case of mimo systems , the findings and results in this paper are also applicable to conventional wmns with single - antenna .",
    "second , to address the non - convex difficulty , we transform the original problem to an equivalent problem under the dual mimo multiple access channel ( mimo - mac ) and show that the transformed problem is convex with respect to the input covariance matrices .",
    "we simplify the maximum weighted sum rate problem for the dual mimo - mac such that enumerating different encoding order is unnecessary , thus paving the way to efficiently solve the link layer subproblem in lagrangian dual decomposition .",
    "last , for the transformed problem , we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates lagrangian dual decomposition method , conjugate gradient projection method based on matrix differential calculus , cutting - plane method , and subgradient method .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model_formulation ] , we discuss the network model and problem formulation .",
    "section  [ sec : reformulation ] discusses how to reformulate the non - connvex original problem by exploiting channel duality . in section  [ sec : soln_proc ] , we introduce the key components for solving the challenging link layer subproblem in the lagrangian decomposition .",
    "numerical results are provided in section  [ sec : numerical ] to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed solution procedure and to study the network performance gain by using dpc .",
    "section  [ sec : related ] reviews related work and section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
