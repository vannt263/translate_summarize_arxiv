    "it is believed that a consistent quantum theory of gravity must be a string theory@xcite which requires additional dimensions in order to be self - consistent .",

    "the additional dimensions must be compactified on some scale @xmath6 so that they are currently unobserved .",
    "it is often assumed that @xmath7 so that new physics would not be visible until these huge energy scales are reached .",
    "this type of model offers no insight as to the origin of the large hierarchy although it can , since the theory is supersymmetric , ensure that the hierarchy is stable with respect to quantum corrections .",
    "recently however it has been suggested that @xmath6 could be much larger , allowing the fundamental scale of gravity , here called @xmath8 , to be close to @xmath2 and so remove the large hierarchy of scales@xcite .",
    "if there are @xmath9 additional dimensions of size @xmath6 , then the observed newton constant is related to the fundamental scale @xmath8 by @xmath10 if @xmath11 tev then @xmath12 mm implying that , if @xmath13 , @xmath6 is smaller than the scales of order 1 mm down to which gravitational interactions have been probed . in this picture the apparent weakness of observed gravity is due to its dilution by the spreading of its field into the additional dimensions .",
    "when an extra dimension is compactified with size @xmath6 , say on a circle , particles propagating exclusively in the extra dimensions appear , from a four dimensional viewpoint , as a tower of massive states .",
    "the characteristic mass splitting of these ( kaluza - klein ) states is of order @xmath14 . in particular",
    ", gravitons propagating in the extra dimensions will appear to be massive states whose coupling to ordinary matter is determined only by gravitational interactions and is therefore known .",
    "however , the standard model particles can not be allowed to propagate into the extra dimensions as there is no `` excited electron '' with mass below a 100 gev .",
    "new physics is expected to appear at a scale @xmath8 ; the details of this physics are model dependent .",
    "this paper is concerned primarily with the model independent signatures and their observability in the atlas detector .",
    "some remarks about the more model dependent signatures appear in the conclusion .",
    "the emission of gravitons in particle collisions is calculable in terms of the universal coupling of gravity to all matter ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "in addition to the emission of massless gravitons , the kaluza - klein excitations that have mass differences of order @xmath14 can also be emitted and their rate calculated as their coupling to ordinary matter is also determined . for experiments involving the collision of particles",
    "whose energy is much larger than this mass splitting , the discrete spectrum can be approximated by a continuum with a density of states @xmath16 .",
    "since these emitted gravitons interact very weakly with ordinary matter , their emission gives rise to missing transverse energy signatures .",
    "the relevant processes for lhc are @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 which give rise to final states of jets plus missing @xmath20 and @xmath21 which gives rise to final states with a photon plus missing @xmath20 .",
    "final states of @xmath22 plus missing @xmath20 are not considered as the effective rates are much lower since the @xmath22 can only be observed at lhc via its leptonic decay .",

    "in addition the backgrounds arise from initial states consisting mainly of @xmath71 collisions , whereas the signal receives contributions from @xmath72 initial states . the greater color charge of the latter again tends to produce more radiation in the signal events .",
