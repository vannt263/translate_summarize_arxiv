    "the phenomenon of superconductivity was discovered @xcite as a sudden drop of resistance to immeasurably small value . with the development of the topic",
    "it was realized that the superconducting phase transition is frequently not at all  sudden  and the measured dependence of the sample resistance @xmath3 in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath4 may have a finite width .",
    "one possible reason for this behavior  and frequently the dominating factor  is the sample inhomogeneity , i.e. the sample might simply consist of regions with different local critical temperatures .",
    "however , with improving fabrication technologies it became clear that even for highly homogeneous samples the superconducting phase transition may remain broadened .",
    "this effect is usually very small in bulk samples and becomes more pronounced in systems with reduced dimensions .",
    "a fundamental physical reason behind such smearing of the transition is _",
    "superconducting fluctuations_.    an important role of fluctuations in reduced dimension is well known . above @xmath4",
    "such fluctuations yield an enhanced conductivity of metallic systems  @xcite . for instance",
    ", the so - called aslamazov - larkin fluctuation correction to conductivity @xmath5 becomes large in the vicinity of @xmath4 and this effect increases with decreasing dimensionality @xmath6 .",
    "below @xmath4  according to the general theorem @xcite  fluctuations should destroy the long - range order in low dimensional superconductors .",
    "thus , it could naively be concluded that low dimensional conductors can not exhibit superconducting properties because of strong phase fluctuation effects .",
    "this conclusion , however , turns out to be somewhat premature .",
    "for instance , 2d structures undergo berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transition @xcite as a result of which the decay of correlations in space changes from exponential at high enough @xmath7 to power law at low temperatures . this result implies that at low @xmath7 long range phase coherence essentially survives in samples of a finite size and , hence , 2d films can well exhibit superconducting properties .    can superconductivity survive also in ( quasi)-1d systems or do fluctuations suppress phase coherence thus disrupting any supercurrent ?",
    "the answer to this question would clearly be of both fundamental interest and practical importance .",
    "on one hand , investigations of this subject definitely help to encover novel physics and shed more light on the crucial role of superconducting fluctuations in 1d wires . on the other hand , rapidly progressing miniaturization of nanodevices opens new horizons for applications of superconducting nanocircuits and requires better understanding of fundamental limitations for the phenomenon of superconductivity in reduced dimension .",
    "a detailed review of the present status of this field is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "it was first pointed out by little @xcite that quasi - one - dimensional wires made of a superconducting material can acquire a finite resistance below @xmath4 of a bulk material due to the mechanism of thermally activated phase slips ( taps ) . within the ginzburg - landau theory",
    "one can describe a superconducting wire by means of a complex order parameter @xmath8 .",
    "thermal fluctuations cause deviations of both the modulus and the phase of this order parameter from their equilibrium values .",
    "a non - trivial fluctuation corresponds to temporal suppression of @xmath9 down to zero in some point ( e.g. , @xmath10 ) inside the wire , see fig .",
    "1 . as soon as the modulus of the order parameter @xmath11 vanishes the phase @xmath12 becomes unrestricted and can jump by the value @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is any integer number .",
    "after this process the modulus @xmath11 gets restored , the phase becomes single valued again and the system returns to its initial state accumulating the net phase shift @xmath13 .",
    "provided such phase slip events are sufficiently rare , one can restrict @xmath14 by @xmath15 and totally disregard fluctuations with @xmath16 .",
    "( left axis , dashed line ) and phase @xmath17 ( right axis solid line ) at various moments of time : ( a ) before , ( b ) during  and ( c ) after the phase slippage.,width=302 ]    according to the josephson relation @xmath18 each such phase slip event causes a nonzero voltage drop @xmath19 across the wire . in the absence of any bias current",
    "the net average numbers of positive  ( @xmath20 ) and negative  ( @xmath21 ) phase slips are equal , thus the net voltage drop remains zero .",
    "applying the current @xmath22 one creates nonzero phase gradient along the wire and makes positive  phase slips more likely than negative  ones .",
    "hence , the net voltage drop @xmath19 due to taps differs from zero , i.e. thermal fluctuations cause non - zero resistance @xmath23 of superconducting wires even below @xmath4 .",
    "we would also like to emphasize that , in contrast to the so - called phase slip centers @xcite produced by a large current above the critical one @xmath24 , here we are dealing with _ fluctuation - induced phase slips _ which can occur at arbitrarily small values @xmath25 .",
    "a quantitative theory of the taps phenomenon was first proposed by langer and ambegaokar @xcite and then completed by mccumber and halperin @xcite .",
    "this lamh theory predicts that the taps creation rate and , hence , resistance of a superconducting wire @xmath26 below @xmath4 are determined by the activation exponent @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the effective potential barrier for taps proportional to the superconducting condensation energy ( @xmath29 is the metallic density of states at the fermi energy and @xmath30 is the bcs order parameter ) for a part of the wire of a volume @xmath31 where superconductivity is destroyed by thermal fluctuations ( @xmath32 is the wire cross section and @xmath33 is the superconducting coherence length ) . at temperatures very close to @xmath4 eq . ( [ taps ] ) yields appreciable resistivity which was indeed detected experimentally @xcite .",
    "close to @xmath4 the experimental results fully confirm the activation behavior of @xmath3 expected from eq .",
    "( [ taps ] ) .",
    "however , as the temperature is lowered further below @xmath4 the number of taps inside the wire decreases exponentially and no measurable wire resistance is predicted by the lamh theory  @xcite except in the immediate vicinity of the critical temperature .",
    "experiments @xcite were done on small whiskers of typical diameters @xmath34 @xmath35 m .",
    "recent progress in nanolithographic technique allowed to fabricate samples with much smaller diameters down to  and even below ",
    "in such systems one can consider a possibility for phase slips to occur not only due to thermal , but also due to _ quantum _ fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the physical picture of quantum phase slippage is qualitatively similar to that of taps ( see fig .",
    "1 ) except the order parameter @xmath9 gets virtually suppressed due the process of _ quantum tunneling_.    following the standard quantum mechanical arguments one can expect that the probability of such tunneling process should be controlled by the exponent @xmath36 , i.e. instead of temperature in the activation exponent ( [ taps ] ) one should just substitute @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an effective attempt frequency .",
    "this is because the order parameter field @xmath39 now tunnels under the barrier @xmath40 rather than overcomes it by thermal activation . since such tunneling process should obviously persist down to @xmath2 one arrives at a fundamentally important conclusion that _ in nanowires superconductivity can be destroyed by quantum fluctuations at any temperature including _ @xmath2 .",
    "accordingly , such nanowires should demonstrate a non - vanishing resistivity down to zero temperature .",
    "_ assuming _ that @xmath41 one would expect that at @xmath42 the taps dependence ( [ taps ] ) applies while at lower @xmath43 quantum phase slips ( qps ) take over , eventually leading to saturation of the temperature dependence @xmath3 to a non - zero value in the limit @xmath44 .",
    "this behavior was indeed observed : giordano @xcite performed experiments which clearly demonstrated a notable resistivity of ultra - thin superconducting wires far below @xmath4 .",
    "these observations could not be adequately interpreted within the taps theory and were attributed to qps .",
    "later other groups also reported noticeable deviations from the lamh theory in thin ( quasi-)1d wires .",
    "these experiments will be discussed in chapter 6 .    it should be noted , however , that despite these developments the idea that in realistic samples superconductivity can be destroyed by quantum fluctuations was initially received with a large portion of scepticism . on one hand , this was due to a number of unsuccessful attempts to experimentally observe the qps phenomenon . on the other hand ,",
    "some early theoretical efforts have led to the results strongly underestimating the actual qps rate . also , unambiguous interpretation of the observations @xcite in terms of qps was questioned because of possible granularity of the samples used in those experiments .",
    "if that was indeed the case , qps could easily be created inside weak links connecting neighboring grains .",
    "also in this case superconducting fluctuations play a very important role @xcite however  in contrast to the case of uniform wires  the superconducting order parameter _ needs not to be destroyed _ during a qps event .",
    "first attempts to theoretically analyze the qps effects @xcite  as well as a number of later studies  were based on the so - called time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equations .",
    "unfortunately the tdgl approach is by far insufficient for the problem in question for a number of reasons : ( i ) a trivial reason is that the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) expansion applies only at temperatures close to @xmath4 whereas in order to describe qps one usually needs to go to lower temperatures down to @xmath45 .",
    "( ii ) more importantly , also at @xmath46 tdgl equation remains applicable only in a special limit of gapless superconductors , while it fails in a general situation considered here .",
    "( iii ) tdgl approach does not account for dissipation effects due to quasiparticles inside the qps core ( in certain cases also outside this core ) which are expected to reduce the probability of qps events similarly to the standard problem of quantum tunneling with dissipation @xcite .",
    "( iv ) tdgl approach is not fully adequate to properly describe excitation of electromagnetic modes around the wire during a qps event ( this effect turns out to be particularly important for sufficiently long wires ) .",
    "thus , tdgl - based description of qps effects simply can not be trusted , and a much more elaborate theory is highly desirable in this situation .",
    "a microscopic theory of qps processes in superconducting nanowires was developed @xcite with the aid of the imaginary time effective action technique @xcite .",
    "this theory remains applicable down to @xmath2 and properly accounts for non - equilibrium , dissipative and electromagnetic effects during a qps event .",
    "one of the main conclusions of this theory is that in sufficiently dirty superconducting nanowires with diameters in the 10 nm range qps probability can already be large enough to yield experimentally observable phenomena . also , further interesting effects including quantum phase transitions caused by interactions between quantum phase slips were predicted @xcite .    an important parameter of this theory is the qps fugacity @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dimensionless conductance of the wire segment of length @xmath49 .",
    "provided @xmath48 is very large , typically @xmath50 , the fugacity @xmath51 remains vanishingly small , qps events are very rare and in many cases can be totally neglected . in such case",
    "the standard bcs mean field description should apply and a finite ( though possibly sufficiently long ) wire remains essentially superconducting outside an immediate vicinity of @xmath4 . for smaller @xmath52 qps effects already become important down to @xmath45 .",
    "finally , at even smaller @xmath53 strong fluctuations should wipe out superconductivity everywhere in the wire .",
    "we also point out that in the case of nanowires considered here the parameter @xmath48 is related to the well known ginzburg number as @xmath54 , i.e. the condition @xmath55 also implies that the fluctuation region becomes of order @xmath4 .",
    "another important parameter is the ratio between the ( superconducting ) quantum resistance unit @xmath56 k@xmath57 and the wire impedance @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the wire capacitance per unit length , @xmath61 is the wire kinetic inductance and @xmath62 is the london penetration depth .",
    "provided this parameter becomes of order one , @xmath63 , superconductivity in sufficiently long wires gets fully suppressed due to intensive fluctuations of the phase @xmath17 of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "we note that both @xmath48 and @xmath35 scale with the wire cross section @xmath32 respectively as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it follows immediately that _ with decreasing the cross section below a certain value the wire inevitably looses intrinsic superconducting properties due to strong fluctuation effects_. for generic parameters both conditions @xmath66 and @xmath63 are typically met for wire diameters in the range @xmath67 nm .",
    "a number of recent experimental observations are clearly consistent with the above theoretical conclusions .",
    "perhaps the first unambiguous evidence for qps effects in quasi-1d wires was reported by bezryadin , lau and tinkham @xcite who fabricated sufficiently uniform superconducting wires with thicknesses down to @xmath68 nm and observed that several samples showed no signs of superconductivity even at temperatures well below the bulk critical temperature .",
    "those results were later confirmed and substantially extended by different experimental groups . at present",
    "there exists an overwhelming experimental evidence for qps effects in superconducting nanowires fabricated to be sufficiently uniform and homogeneous .",
    "below we will analyze the main experimental results and compare them with theoretical predictions .",
    "yet another interesting issue is related to persistent currents ( pc ) in superconducting nanorings .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that qps effects can significantly modify pc in such systems and even lead to exponential suppression of supercurrent for sufficiently large ring perimeters .",
    "another important factor that can substantially affect pc in isolated superconducting nanorings at low @xmath7 is the electron parity number .",
    "of particular interest is the behavior of rings with odd number of electrons which can develop _ spontaneous _ supercurrent in the ground state without any externally applied magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "the structure of our review is as follows .",
    "a theory of superconducting fluctuations in nanowires will be addressed in chapters 2 - 5 . in chapter 2",
    "we discuss a general derivation of the real time effective action of a superconductor suitable for further investigations of fluctuation effects at temperatures below @xmath4 .",
    "we also formulate the langevin equations and analyze their relation to tdgl - type of equations frequently used in the literature . in chapter 3",
    "we adopt our general formalism to the case of superconducting nanowires and demonstrate the importance of superconducting fluctuations in such structures .",
    "in chapter 4 we will briefly review lamh theory of thermally activated phase slips .",
    "quantum phase slip effects will be analyzed in details in chapter 5 .",

    "following the standard analysis of logarithmically interacting 2d coulomb gas @xcite which is based on the renormalization group ( rg ) equations both for the interaction parameter @xmath35 and the charge fugacity @xmath51 . defining the scaling parameter @xmath583 we have @xcite @xmath584 following the standard line of reasoning",
    "we immediately conclude that a quantum phase transition for phase slips occurs in a long superconducting wire at @xmath238 and @xmath585 this is essentially a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase transtion  @xcite for charges @xmath581 in space - time .",
    "the difference from the standard bkt transition in 2d superconducting films is only that in our case the transition is driven by the wire thickness @xmath586 ( which enters into @xmath35 ) and not by temperature . in other words , for thicker wires with @xmath587",
    "quantum phase slips with opposite topological charges are bound in pairs ( dipols ) and the @xmath588 resistance of a superconducting wire is strongly suppressed and @xmath7-dependent . this resistance tends to vanish in the limit @xmath238 .",
    "thus , we arrive at an important conclusion : at @xmath2 a long quasi-1d superconducting wire remains in a superconducting state , with vanishing linear resistance , provided its thickness is sufficiently large and , hence , the electromagnetic interaction between phase slips is sufficiently strong , i.e. @xmath587 .    on the other hand , for @xmath589 the density of free ( unbound ) quantum phase slips in the wire always remains finite , such fluctuations destroy the phase coherence ( and , hence , superconductivity ) and bring the wire into the normal state with non - vanishing resistance even at @xmath2 .",
    "thus , another important conclusion is that superconductivity in sufficiently thin wires is _ always _ destroyed by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the above analysis is valid for sufficiently long wires . for typical experimental parameters , however , @xmath590 ( or even @xmath591 ) , and the finite wire size needs to be accounted for . for this purpose we modify the above rg treatment in the following manner .",
    "starting from small scales @xmath592 we increase the scaling parameter @xmath593 and renormalize both @xmath35 and @xmath51 according to rg equations ( [ btkrg ] ) . solving these equations up to @xmath594 we",

    "@xmath596 only the time coordinate matters and we arrive at the partition function fully equivalent to one for a ( 0d ) superconducting weak link ( josephson junction ) in the presence of quantum fluctuations of the phase .",
    "these systems are described in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , therefore an extended discussion of this issue can be avoided here .",
    "we only point out that our renormalized fugacity @xmath597 is equivalent to the tunneling amplitude of the josephson phase ( normalized by the josephson plasma frequency ) , i.e. @xmath598 where @xmath599 is the action of an instanton ( kink ) in a josephson junction , @xmath600 and @xmath601 are respectively the josephson and the charging energies .",
    "the subsequent analysis essentially depends on the presence ( or absence ) of additional dissipation in our system . in the absence of dissipation at @xmath352 the josephson junction _ always _ remains in the normal ( i.e. non - superconducting ) state since superconductivity is suppressed by quantum fluctuations of the phase and tunneling of cooper pairs is prohibited @xcite . due to eq .",
    "( [ equival ] ) exactly the same conclusion applies for sufficiently short superconducting wires studied here . in the presence of additional dissipation , however , quantum fluctuations of the phase can be suppressed and , hence , superconductivity can be restored @xcite .    of particular importance is the case of ohmic dissipation which is realized either provided the wire is shunted by a normal resistor @xmath602 , or the wire itself has a non - vanishing normal conductivity @xmath603 even far from the qps core .",
    "the latter situation can occur , e.g. , at finite ( and not too low ) temperatures due to the presence of a sufficient number of quasiparticles above the gap or possibly also due to nonequilibrium effects .",
    "bearing in mind that in a number of experiments with ultra - thin wires ( to be discussed below ) qps effects were observed already at sufficiently high temperatures @xmath604 it is worth to briefly address the model with ohmic dissipation here .    in this case",
    "our consideration should be modified employing a two stage scaling procedure @xcite .",
    "at it was already explained , we first proceed with 2d rg equations ( [ btkrg ] ) up to the scale @xmath594 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that ohmic dissipation does not significantly affect rg eqs .",
    "( [ btkrg ] ) at such small scales .",
    "eventually we arrive at the renormalized fugacity @xmath595 . at larger scales",
    "the space coordinate is irrelevant and the problem reduces to that of a 1d coulomb gas with logarithmic interaction .",
    "therefore , ( for @xmath605 ) further scaling is defined by @xcite @xmath606 where the interaction parameter @xmath607 depends on the dissipation strength being equal to either ( i ) @xmath608 or to ( ii ) @xmath609 . for @xmath610",
    "the fugacity scales down to zero , which again corresponds to a superconducting phase , whereas for @xmath611 it increases indicating a resistive phase in complete analogy to a single josephson junction with ohmic dissipation . in the case ( ii )",
    "the phase transition point again depends on the wire cross section @xmath32 as well as on its total length @xmath350 and the value @xmath612 .",
    "thus , two different quantum phase transitions can occur in superconducting nanowires .",
    "one of them is the bkt - like phase transition which is controlled by the strength @xmath35 of inter - qps electromagnetic interactions and eventually by the wire thickness .",
    "another one is the schmid phase transition occurring in the presence of ohmic dissipation @xcite provided , e.g. , by an external shunt resistance @xmath602 .",

    "the linear resistance becomes  @xcite @xmath645 or @xmath646 , i.e. @xmath26 is just equal either to the quasiparticle resistance of the wire or to the shunt resistance .",
    "the physics of this result is exactly the same as in the case of resistively shunted josephson junctions : the superconducting channel turns out to be completely blocked by quantum fluctuations and the current can only flow through the normal resistance .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the above results were derived for sufficiently _ uniform _ nanowires with ( almost ) constant cross - section @xmath32 .",
    "as we already mentioned above , the very existence of quantum phase slips and/or the possibility to experimentally observe qps effects in such wires were debated at an early stage of the research . at present there already exist a large number of independent experiments by different groups providing an overwhelming evidence that qps effects essentially determine low temperature properties of ultra - thin superconducting wires .",
    "a detailed comparison between these experimental results and the above theoretical predictions will be carried out in the next chapter .",
    "it is quite obvious that our qps theory does not require strict uniformity of the system , it will also apply provided there exist relatively small diameter variations along the wire which are practically unavoidable in any realistic experimental situation .",
    "the probability for qps to occur will be higher in thinner parts of the wire than in thicker ones , otherwise all the physics remains essentially the same .",
    "this situation should be contrasted to that of chains of josephson junctions and 1d granular wires in which case quantum phase slips occur inside the junctions ( tunnel barriers ) and do not require any suppression of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "in other words , such quantum phase slips have no core at all .",
    "accordingly , no condensation energy is lost during such phase slip events and also dissipative effects remain insignificant ( unless josephson junctions are shunted by external normal resistors ) .    note that , although the qps core physics for uniform and granular quasi-1d wires is entirely different , the behavior of these systems at larger scales can be qualitatively similar .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the bkt - like quantum phase transition ( driven by the ratio @xmath647 ) occurs in 1d superconducting granular arrays @xcite similarly to the case of uniform wires @xcite .",
    "also , schmid - like quantum dissipative phase transitions in arrays and chains of resistively shunted josephson junctions were studied in a great detail , see @xcite and further references therein .",
    "one of the main conclusions reached there was that dissipative phase transitions yield _ local _ phase coherence in a long chain of junctions provided each of such junctions is shunted by an effective ohmic resistance below some value of order the quantum resistance unit @xmath648 . in contrast , at @xmath45 bkt - like quantum phase transition yields global phase coherence in josephson chains provided @xmath649 . as a result ,",
    "one arrives at a non - trivial phase diagram with all possible combinations of local and global order @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that more recently the models of resistively shunted superconducting granular chains were studied @xcite aiming to interpret some recent experimental data @xcite seemingly indicating that the superconducting phase transition can be driven by the global wire resistance . within this approach dissipation",
    "is introduced phenomenologically employing an effective two - fluid model .",
    "it remains unclear , however , what could be the physical origin of ohmic dissipation in sufficiently long and nominally uniform superconducting wires at temperatures well below the gap @xmath102 .",
    "an alternative proposal aimed to explain recent experimental observations in relatively short nanowires @xcite is discussed below in sec . 6.3    we should also stress that even if the diameter remains strictly constant the wire can be considered uniform only at length scales exceeding the elastic electron mean free path @xmath148 whereas at the scale @xmath650 this uniformity is naturally broken by the presence of impurities and defects .",
    "scattering of electrons at such impurities and defects plays a very important role since it breaks galilei invariance thus preventing from momentum conservation for electrons propagating along the wire @xcite . momentum non - conservation is in turn necessary for qps to occur since quantum phase slips `` unwind '' the supercurrent thus generating momentum transfer . at @xmath2 ( i.e. in the absence of phonons ) this extra momentum can not be absorbed in perfectly clean and uniform wires in which case qps would be strictly prohibited . on a formal level , this implies that the qps action @xmath418 should become large in the clean limit @xcite .",
    "in fact , this effect can be observed within our analysis too , one just needs to formally take the limit @xmath489 in eq .",
    "( [ s321 ] ) .    for completeness ,",
    "let us mention about several proposals concerning the nature of qpt in long superconducting nanowires with impurities .",
    "khlebnikov and pryadko @xcite argued that this transition should occur at @xmath651 as a dissipative qpt @xcite rather than the bkt - like qpt discussed here .",
    "accordingly , for the wire resistance they suggested @xmath652 instead of @xmath653 , cf .",
    "( [ 2mu-3 ] ) .",
    "@xcite , on the contrary , found qpt of the bkt universality class but claimed it to be superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) rather than superconductor - metal transition ( smt ) as originally suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in their analysis khlebnikov and pryadko @xcite used a simplified gross - pitaevski action which is in many respects different from the microscopic effective action for superconducting wires derived in chapter 2 . within this phenomenological approach",
    "the authors @xcite first evaluated the qps rate for a given disorder configuration and only then performed averaging over disorder .",
    "in contrast , within our analysis averaging over disorder is performed in the effective action before introducing qps .",
    "this latter way is appropriate for diffusive superconducting wires , e.g. , because the qps core size @xmath654 greatly exceeds the electron mean free path @xmath148 .",
    "the condition @xmath655 allows to treat the wire as effectively homogeneous for qps and the problem acquires an extra zero mode corresponding arbitrary shifts of the qps core along the wire .",

    "as before , we can express the partition function @xmath505 in terms of series in powers of the qps fugacity ( cf .",

    "the quasi-1d superconducting wire with mooij - schn plasmons as elementary excitations plays the role of an effective _ dissipative _ environment for the constriction .",
    "such qpt was discussed by hekking and glazman @xcite in the case of a narrow superconducting ring interrupted by the josephson junction . in the situation considered here",
    "this qpt appears to be of little importance since @xmath664 , i.e. at @xmath432 bkt - like qpt occurs when quantum phase slips inside the constriction are still bound in pairs .    on the other hand , at not very low temperatures and",

    "let us compare the behavior of josephson chains and homogeneous wires .",

    "it only implies strong fluctuations of the phases across barriers with _ no suppression _ of superconductivity inside metallic grains . in this case inter - grain tunneling of cooper pairs is prohibited by electron - electron interactions and the system is in the insulating ( coulomb blockade ) phase .    on the contrary , large renormalized qps fugacity @xmath51 in the case of homogeneous wires",
    "implies that the qps gas becomes dense , the qps cores overlap and , hence , for @xmath673 and @xmath238 superconductivity gets eventually destroyed everywhere in the wire . in other words , in this regime",
    "quantum fluctuations drive homogeneous ultra - thin superconducting wires _ normal_. this important difference between homogeneous and granular wires was emphasized in ref .",
    "what remains is to figure out whether such normal diffusive wires stay metallic or turn insulating at low enough @xmath7 .",
    "few years after the work @xcite it was realized that , similarly to highly conducting tunnel barriers @xcite disordered metallic wires with large conductances also demonstrate the feature of _ weak coulomb blockade _ @xcite caused by non - trivial interplay between scattering and electron - electron interactions .",
    "the presence of an ( exponentially small ) coulomb gap implies that disordered wires most likely turn insulating at @xmath2 .",
    "however , in generic metallic wires with many conducting channels such a state can only be observed at exponentially low @xmath674 , while for any experimentally attainable temperature one expects a metallic behavior with a weak trend for the wire resistance to grow with decreasing @xmath7 due to coulomb blockade corrections @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such a trend was indeed observed in recent experiments @xcite and the measured dependence @xmath3 was found to closely follow theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "further theoretical analysis of the role of electron - electron interactions in quasi-1d structures @xcite would be highly desirable @xcite .",
    "it follows from our theoretical analysis that both taps and  in particular qps can be observed in sufficiently thin superconducting wires , i.e. experiments aimed to observe qps - related phenomena should be performed on samples with smallest possible cross section values @xmath32 . on top of that , it is highly desirable to deal with structurally ( and chemically ) homogeneous samples in order to eliminate spatial variations of @xmath4 along the wire and rule out the effect of ( possibly existing ) constrictions and tunnel barriers .",
    "it has been shown that structural imperfections of real quasi-1d structures ( non - uniform cross section , existence of probes and finite length effects ) might effectively mask the phenomena related to thermal or quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above requirements , in order to provide optimal conditions for observation of fluctuation effects it is crucial to properly choose the sample material . this is obvious from the fact that , for instance , the qps core action ( [ otvet ] ) at low enough @xmath7 can be represented in the form @xmath675 where @xmath676 is the wire resistivity in the normal state .",
    "hence , it is desirable to select superconducting materials with smaller values of @xmath4 ( or @xmath677 ) and perform experiments on sufficiently dirty nanowires with higher values of @xmath678 .",
    "the latter requirement is in line with the well known general observation that fluctuation effects are more pronounced in dirtier systems .",

    "theoretical analysis of nanowires reveals further interesting effects , like qps - binding - unbinding quantum phase transition ( qpt ) @xcite between superconducting and non - superconducting phases which is predicted to occur as the impedance of a superconducting wire becomes of order of the quantum resistance unit @xmath1117 6.5 k@xmath57 . for typical parameters",
    "this condition is also achieved for wire diameters in the 10 nm range . to the best of our knowledge , no clear experimental evidence for this phase transition exists so far .",
    "this can be due to rather stringent requirements : qpt can only be observed in long nanowires at sufficiently low temperatures , ideally at @xmath45 .",
    "interesting effects may occur also in short nanowires forming weak links between superconducting electrodes . in many respects such systems",
    "can behave similarly to josephson nanojunctions and weak links .",
    "novel effects are also expected in superconducting nanorings . while rings formed by thicker wires demonstrate the standard behavior familiar from the bulk samples , the situation changes drastically as soon as the wire thickness",
    "gets reduced down to @xmath1118 10 nm or below this value . in this case",
    "qps effects become important leading to strong fluctuations of the magnetic flux inside the ring . as a result , the amplitude of persistent current decreases and its flux dependence changes from the sawtooth - like to a smoother one @xcite . for such rings",
    "even at @xmath2 persistent current gets exponentially suppressed by quantum fluctuations provided the ring radius @xmath26 exceeds the critical scale @xmath1119 where @xmath1120 is the action of the qps core . for typical wire parameters the length @xmath928 can be of order of a micron or even smaller .",
    "this length constitutes another fundamental scale associated with quantum phase slips .",
    "yet another important factor which may influence persistent currents in isolated superconducting nanorings is the electron parity number .",
    "this influence is particularly strong in nanorings containing a weak link with few conducting modes .",
    "changing the electron parity number from even to odd may result in _ spontaneous _ supercurrent in the ground state of such rings without any externally applied magnetic flux @xcite . at @xmath2",
    "this current is produced by the only unpaired electron which occupies the lowest available andreev state . under certain conditions",
    "this spontaneous supercurrent can reach remarkably large values up to @xmath1121 na which can be reliably detected in modern experiments .",
