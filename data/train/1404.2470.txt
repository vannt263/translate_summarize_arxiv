    "the systems presented herein were chosen for the following reasons : ( 1 ) their existing light curves ( hereafter lcs ) were either incomplete , or not multi - filtered , ( 2 ) they are bright enough to obtain radial velocities measurements ( hereafter rvs ) , ( 3 ) they are candidates for triplicity @xcite , and ( 4 ) they are also candidates for including an oscillating component @xcite .",
    "new rvs and lcs of these systems were obtained with the aim : ( a ) to derive the absolute elements of their components , ( b ) to search photometrically and spectroscopically for the presence of a tertiary companion and ( c ) to look for possible pulsational behaviour of the components .    *",

    "the photometric observations were carried out at the gerostathopoulion observatory of the university of athens during 23 nights ( 13 for cc  her and 10 for cm  lac ) on april - september 2009 , using the 0.4  m cassegrain telescope equipped with the st-10xme ccd camera and the @xmath11 bessell photometric filters .",

    "the spectral region between 4800    and 5350   , where h@xmath10 and numerous metallic lines are strong , was used for the spectral classification .",
    "the rest part of the spectra was ignored , because not enough metallic lines with significant signal - to - noise ratios existed . due to the lack of spectroscopic observations during the eclipses",
    ", it was not possible to estimate the spectral type of the components of the systems , but only their combined spectral types .",
    "however , the combined spectra of the systems were compared with those of standard stars .",
    "the variables spectra , taken near the maximum separation of the components ( around phases 0.25 and 0.75 ) , were subtracted from those of each standard deriving sums of squared residuals in each case ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "such least squares sums allowed the best match between the spectra of variable and standard to be found . for cc  her the best comparison was found with hip  70400 which is an a5 type star , while the combined spectrum of cm  lac was fitted better with the spectrum of an a7 type star , namely hip  116928 .",

    "the _ broadening functions _",
    "( bfs ) method @xcite on the spectra was used .",
    "this method is based on the comparison between non - broadened lines , but perhaps with a small shift ( i.e. the lines of a standard star ) , and broadened and shifted ones ( i.e. the lines of a binary system ) .",
    "it produces both the broadening and shifting , that practically correspond to the rvs of the components .",
    "briefly , the main difference between the bfs and the widely used cross - correlation - function ( ccf ) , as presented by @xcite , is the production of the baselines .",
    "the ccf , in the cases of binary spectra , indeed takes into account the shape of the spectrum , but does not exclude the natural broadening from the sharp - line template ( i.e. sharp metallic lines ) .",
    "the latter defines poorly the baseline and the peak - pulling for the components . on the other hand ,",
    "the bfs are based on linear equations , produce well - defined baselines , while the peak - pulling effects are absent .",
    "we cropped all spectra in order to avoid the broad h@xmath10 line , and we included all the sharp metallic lines between 4865 - 5355   .",
    "each rv value and its error was derived statistically ( mean value and error ) from the respective velocities resulted from this method by using different comparison standard stars with similar spectral types ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",

    "cc  her was listed by @xcite as candidate to contain a pulsating component . in that study",
    "the only candidacy criterion was the spectral type of the components ( a - f ) .",
    "therefore , since cm  lac is also an a - type binary , its lcs were tested for pulsations too . for this , the theoretical lcs in all filters were subtracted from the observations and a frequency search was performed in the interval 5 to 80  c / d ( typical for @xmath26 sct stars , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the out - of the primary eclipse data .",
    "the software _ period04 _",
    "v.1.2 @xcite , that is based on classical fourier analysis , was used .",
    "the results showed that neither star showed definite pulsational behaviour in the selected range of frequencies with a signal  to  noise ratio higher than 4 , given the time resolution and the photometric errors provided for each system ( see section 2 ) .",
    "new spectroscopic and multicolour photometric observations of cc  her and cm  lac were obtained and analysed with the most modern available techniques .",
    "the combination of the results derived from these methods made it possible to determine the absolute parameters of the components of the systems and allowed us to make a good estimate of their present evolutionary status .",
    "in addition , the four colour lcs provided the means for an accurate modelling and more cautious investigation for tertiary components by checking their possible light contribution to different filter data .",
    "the lcs of both systems were checked for pulsations , but the results were negative .    cc  her is a classical algol - type binary with its secondary component filling its roche lobe .",
    "its primary component is a ms star , while the secondary is at the subgiant stage of evolution .",
    "the orbital period analysis of the system @xcite did not show evidence of secular change of the period that can be connected with the mass transfer ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the system is semidetached .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by assuming a very slow mass transfer rate that can not be detected in the given date range of the o@xmath27c data .    in the same study a third body with minimal mass @xmath28",
    "was suggested as the most possible explanation for the cyclic period modulation . however , that mass value was based on an assumed total mass of 5.24  @xmath2 of the binary s components .",
    "our results show that the components have masses of 1.91  @xmath2 and 0.56  @xmath2 , for primary and secondary , respectively , hence the total mass @xmath29 is 2.47  @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , according to the results of @xcite , considering the mass function value ( @xmath30=0.31  @xmath2 ) and using its formula ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath31 we found that the minimal mass @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) of the potential third body is @xmath34 .",
    "a close star with such mass is expected to be easily traced in both photometric and spectroscopic observations . in particular , assuming its ms nature , we can estimate its luminosity according to the mass - luminosity relation ( @xmath35 ) for dwarf stars and compare it with the luminosity of the binary s components ( see table  [ tab4 ] ) by using the following formula : @xmath36 the above calculations resulted in a luminosity contribution of @xmath3730% . on the other hand",
    ", the lc analysis revealed the existence of a third light contribution to the total luminosity , but its fraction was found to have a relatively small value ( @xmath371.7% ) .",
    "moreover , the rvs analysis identified only two peaks and no evidence of another third one .",
    "this large difference between the expected and observed luminosity results rejects the simplest scenario of a ms star orbiting the eclipsing pair .",
    "very probably , one explanation for this could be the situation where the additional body is not a single star , but a multiple system that consists of low temperature components with a total mass of @xmath34 .",
    "alternatively , the absence of significant light contribution of the third body in the observed bands might allow us to think also that this body might be a compact object ( e.g. neutron star or stellar black hole ) . assuming a simultaneous birth of the components of the triple system and taking into account both the mass value of the third body and that the eclipsing pair has an evolved component , we conclude that the third body has had sufficient time to evolve into a compact object .",
    "probably , future observations in another wavelengths ( e.g. x - rays ) might solve this mystery .",
    "however , for both previous scenarios concerning the nature of the third body , the expected luminosity contribution is much less than the calculated one for a single ms star and its absence from the spectra is reasonable .",
    "another explanation for this discrepancy could be the scenario of magnetic influences to the orbital period ( quadrupole moment variation@xmath38 ) from the secondary component , widely known as the applegate s mechanism @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed the relations for calculating the @xmath38 of a binary s component .",
    "therefore , by substituting to these relations the results of the o@xmath27c diagram analysis of @xcite , and the radius of the secondary component and the system s major axis ( see table  [ tab4 ] ) we found @xmath39  g  cm@xmath22 , which lies between the range @xmath41 and could potentially implicate the cyclic period modulation of the system @xcite .",
    "although we found that the secondary component is magnetically active ( see section  3.2 ) , we can not be certain that the applegate s mechanism takes place in this system , since it also suggests brightness changes that can not be checked from our data set due to the short time span of the observations .",
    "concluding , astrometric observations for detecting motion around the barycenter of the possible multiple system and several years monitoring of the binary for brightness changes seem to be necessary for clarifying the multiplicity of cc  her .",
    "cm  lac consists of two ms stars with almost same radii and different masses in a detached configuration .",
    "however , the less massive component appears slightly more evolved than the primary .",
    "this result comes in disagreement with the theory of stellar evolution considering the initial mass and assuming a simultaneous birth .",
    "hence , this status feeds the evolutionary scenario of past mass transfer .",
    "probably , the mass transfer was occurring in the past with a direction from the secondary to the primary component and , therefore , the secondary had been evolved faster than the primary , till the mass flow ended .",
    "however , now the components seem to be at relaxation phase and also in asynchronous orbit , something which is very common in detached systems .",
    "the present results for absolute parameters are in very good agreement with those of past studies @xcite . contrary to that",
    ", our lcs and rvs analyses results do not show evidence for a tertiary component , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , cc  her and",
    "cm  lac can be considered as two very good ` astrophysical labs ' since they are both eclipsing double - line spectroscopic binaries and they provide a lot of useful information about the evolution of binary systems .",
