    "the ambient seeing varied from @xmath17  0.6@xmath5 to 1.1@xmath5 during the observations .",

    "unfortunately , due to poor atmospheric transmission above 2.4 @xmath16 m , it was not possible to derive a sensible estimate for extinction using the 1@xmath30  s(1 ) and q(3 ) lines .",

    "[ fig : oh231_naco_sin_wfpc2 ] [ d ] ) shows two regions of h@xmath1 oriented at a position angle ( pa ) of 113@xmath11 , from brightest to faintest peak . if we assume that the distribution of the h@xmath1 around the central region of oh231 is in a disc configuration then by measuring the major and minor axis we can estimate the inclination angle of the equatorial disc with respect to the plane of the sky from the h@xmath1 data .",
    "measurements for @xmath35/@xmath36  are determined by superposing a full ellipse onto the h@xmath1 line map .",

    "a halo of scattered light at r@xmath174/5200  au  @xcite ;    from our observations the geometry of the h@xmath1 region is unclear , however we offer two possibilities : ( 1 ) a disc of h@xmath1 : figure  [ fig : oh231_naco_sin_wfpc2 ] ( d ) shows what might be interpreted as an incomplete disc of h@xmath1 , which fits with the series of concentric disc / tori structures listed above . to understand why we observe only emission from the edges and not the front of the disc , a comparison of the noise in the continuum at the front of the putative disc , to the amplitude of the 1@xmath30s(1 )  line peak shows both to be of the same order .",
    "we might then attribute the ` missing ' h@xmath1 in this region to variations in the continuum .",
    "we would not expect to observe the back of the disc due to the high level of extinction through the nebula .",
    "( 2 ) a shell of h@xmath1 : if the h@xmath1 is situated in an axisymmetric shell surrounding the central star , we might explain the geometry of the h@xmath1 regions by assuming a density contrast between the poles and equator .",
    "this , combined with an increased column depth at the edge of the shell would manifest itself as two arcs of h@xmath1 emission situated equatorially  ( as noted by * ? ? ? * for iras  19306 + 1407 ) .",
    "this is supported by the detection of a shell of higher density gas and dust at the same location as the h@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "both scenarios offer plausible explanations for the geometry of the h@xmath1 emitting region , however further observations are needed in order to favour one .     showing the detected lines ,",

    "channel maps of the 1@xmath30s(1 )  line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oh231_ch_maps_cen ] ) show no significant change in the distribution of the h@xmath1 .    in an attempt to explain the lack of reported h@xmath1 in this object , we note two previous studies : ( 1 ) @xcite give a 3@xmath20 upper limit of 10@xmath44 ergs cm@xmath22 s@xmath15 ster@xmath15 ( 1@xmath20 limit = 6.6@xmath610@xmath45 w m@xmath22 ) for the surface brightness of the 1@xmath30s(1 )  line towards oh231 .",
    "this places their measurement limit close to the 1@xmath30s(1 )  line strength given in table  [ tab : h2_fluxes ] , implying that the 1@xmath30s(1 )  line in their observations would be difficult to distingush from noise , or possibly that their slit position , aligned east - west across inferred central star position , did not include the h@xmath1 sites ; ( 2 ) @xcite , using the isaac instrument on vlt , do not report any detection of h@xmath1 .",
    "however , this can be explained due to the orientation of the slit , aligned from south - west to north - east along the major axis ( private comm . ) , with a slit - width of 0.8 , i.e. , the central h@xmath1 emission site was not covered .    0s(1 )  line from the central region of oh231 .",
