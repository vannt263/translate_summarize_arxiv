    "multiple target tracking is the problem of estimating an unknown and time varying number of trajectories from observed data .",
    "there are two main challenges in this problem .",
    "the first is the time - varying number of targets due to the appearance of new targets and deaths of existing targets , while the second is the unknown association between measurements and targets , which is further confounded by false measurements and missed detections of actual targets @xcite .",
    "the bayes optimal approach to the multi - target tracking problem is the bayes multi - target filter that recursively propagates the multi - target posterior density forward in time @xcite incorporating both the uncertainty in the number of objects as well as their states . under the standard multi - target system model ( which takes into account target births , deaths , survivals and detections , misdetections and clutter )",
    ", the multi - target posterior densities at each time are generalized labeled multi - bernoulli ( glmb ) densities @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-glmb filter @xcite is an analytic solution to the multi - target bayes filter .",
    "while a non - maneuvering target motion can be described by a fixed model , a combination of motion models that characterise different maneuvers may be needed to describe the motion of a maneuvering target.tracking a maneuvering target in clutter is a challenging problem and is the subject of numerous works @xcite . tracking multiple maneuvering targets involves jointly estimating the number of targets and their states at each time step in the presence of noise , clutter , uncertainties in target maneuvers , data association and detection . as such , this problem is extremely challenging in both theory and implementation .",
    "the jump markov system ( jms ) or multiple models approach has proven to be an effective tool for single maneuvering target tracking @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the target can switch between a set of models in a markovian fashion .",
    "the interacting multiple model(imm ) and variable - structure imm ( vs - imm ) estimators @xcite are two well known single - target filtering algorithms for maneuvering targets .",
    "the number of modes in the imm is kept fixed , whereas in the vs - imm the number of modes are adaptively selected from a fixed set of modes for improved estimation accuracy and computational efficiency .",
    "a probability hypothesis density ( phd ) filter @xcite for maneuvering target tracking was derived in @xcite together with a gaussian mixture implementation and particle implementation . as shown by mahler in @xcite ,",
    "this was the only mathematically valid filter amongst severval phd ( and cardinalized phd ) filters proposed for jump markov systems ( jmss ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recently , multi - bernoulli and labeled multi - bernoulli @xcite , @xcite filters were also derived for jmss in @xcite .",
    "these filters , however , are only approximate solutions to the bayes multi - target filter for maneuvering targets , and at present there are no exact solutions in the literature .    in this paper , we propose an analytic solution to the bayes multi - target filter for maneuvering target tracking using jmss . specifically , we extend the glmb filter to jmss that can be implemented via gaussian mixture or sequential monte carlo methods .",
    "in addition to being an analytic solution and hence more accurate than approximations , the proposed solution outputs tracks or trajectories of the targets , whereas the phd and ( unlabeled ) multi - bernoulli filters do not .",
    "the proposed technique is verified via numerical examples .",
    "we review jms and the bayes multi - target tracking filter in this section .",
    "a jms consists of a set of parameterised state space models , whose parameters evolve with time according to a finite state markov chain .",
    "an example of a maneuvering target scenario which can be successfully represented using a jms model is the dynamics of an aircraft , which can fly with a nearly constant velocity motion , accelerated / decelerated motion , and coordinated turn @xcite . under a jms framework for such a system a target that is moving under a certain motion model at any time step",
    "are assumed to follow the same motion model with a certain probability or switch to a different motion model ( that belongs to a set of pre - selected motion models ) with a certain probability in the next time step .",
    "a markovian transition probability matrix describes the probabilities with which a particular target changes / retains the motion model in the next time step given the motion model at current time step .",
    "let @xmath1 denote the probability of switching to motion model @xmath2 from @xmath3 as given by this markovian transition matrix , in which the sum of the conditional probabilities of all possible motion models in the next time step given the current model adds upto 1 , i.e.,@xmath4where @xmath5 is the ( discrete ) set of motion models in the system .",
    "suppose that model @xmath2 is in effect at time @xmath6 , then the state transition density from @xmath7 , at time @xmath8 , to @xmath9 , at time @xmath6 , is denoted by @xmath10 , and the likelihood of @xmath9 generating the measurement @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the joint transition of the state and the motion model assumes the form:@xmath13 in general , the measurement can also depend on the model @xmath2 and hence the likelihood function becomes @xmath14 .",
    "note that by defining the augmented system state as @xmath15 a jms model can be written as a standard state space model .",
    "jms models are not only useful for tracking maneuvering targets , but are also useful in the estimation of unknown clutter parameters @xcite .      in the bayes",
    "multi - target tracking filter , the state of a target includes an ordered pair of integers @xmath16 , where @xmath6 is the time of birth , and @xmath17 is a unique index to distinguish targets born at the same time .",

    "the bayes multi - target tracking filter consists of a prediction step and an update step , which propagate the multi - target posterior / filtering density forward in time . note that the integral in this case is the _ set integral _ from finite set statistics @xcite .",

    "note that the same multi - target recursion - also holds for multi - target states without labels .",
    "a generic particle implementation of the multi - target bayes recursions - ( for both labeled and unlabeled multi - target states ) was given in @xcite , while analytic approximations for unlabeled multi - target states , such as the phd , cardinalized phd and multi - bernoulli filters were proposed in mahler1,mahlercphdaes , vomagmphd05,vogaussiancphd07,vvc09,vvps10 .",

    "<S> a multiple maneuvering target system can be viewed as a jump markov system ( jms ) in the sense that the target movement can be modeled using different motion models where the transition between the motion models by a particular target follows a markov chain probability rule . </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes a generalized labelled multi - bernoulli ( glmb ) filter for tracking maneuvering targets whose movement can be modeled via such a jms . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed filter is validated with two linear and non - linear maneuvering target tracking examples . </S>"
