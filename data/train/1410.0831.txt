    "nonequilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states describe several problems , such as wetting phenomena , spreading of diseases , chemical reactions and others @xcite . in the last years",
    ", a large effort for its characterization including experimental verifications @xcite and the establishment of distinct universality classes @xcite have been undertaken .",
    "generically , continuous phase transitions into an absorbing state for systems without conservation laws nor extra symmetries fall into in the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite .",
    "the best example of this category is probably the contact process ( cp ) @xcite .",
    "it is defined on a given @xmath0-dimensional lattice and the dynamics comprehends the creation in the presence of at least one adjacent particle and spontaneous annihilation .",
    "since the particle creation requires the presence of adjacent particles , a configuration devoided of species is absorbing .",
    "conversely , discontinuous absorbing transitions also appear in different systems @xcite , but comparatively they have received less attention than the continuous ones .",
    "recently , they have attracted interest for the search of minimal ingredients for their occurrence , being one possibility the so called `` restrictive '' ( threshold ) contact processes ( cps ) .",
    "these models are variants of the second schgl model , in which the particle creation is similar to the usual cp , but instead it requires a minimal neighborhood larger than 1 particle for creating a new species @xcite .",
    "different studies have stated that the phase transition , induced by this mild change ( with respect to the usual cp ) , remains unaffected under the inclusion of distinct creation @xcite and annihilation rules @xcite as well as for different lattice topologies @xcite . in some specific cases",
    "@xcite , in which the particle creation occurs only if one has at least two adjacent diagonal pairs of particles , the phase transition is characterized by a generic two - phase coexistence and exhibits an interface orientational dependence at the transition point . on the other hand , when the transition rates depend only on the number of nearest neighbors particles ( and not their orientations ) the discontinuous transitions take place at a single point @xcite .    despite the apparent robustness of first - order transitions for the above mentioned restrictive examples ,",
    "the effect of some ( relevant ) dynamics has been so far unexplored in the present context .",
    "these dynamics , such as spatial disorder and particle diffusion , can cause drastic changes in continuous phase transitions @xcite .",
    "one of the few available studies shows that spatial disorder suppresses the phase coexistence , giving rise to a continuous transition belonging to a new universality class @xcite .",
    "a similar scenario of scarce results also holds for the outcome of diffusion .",
    "very recently , a stochastic differential equation ( such as a langevin equation ) reported that different diffusion strengths lead to opposite findings ( in two dimensions ) . whenever the transition is discontinuous for larger diffusion values ,",
    "limited rates suppress it , giving rise to a critical phase transition belonging to the dp universality class @xcite . with these ideas in mind",
    ", we give a further step by tackling the influence of diffusion in lattice systems presenting discontinuous absorbing phase transitions .",
    "@xcite . our study aims to answer three fundamental points : ( i ) what is the effect of strong and limited diffusion in these cases ? ( ii ) does it suppress the discontinuous transition ?",
    "( iii ) how does our results compare with those obtained from the coarse - grained description in ref .",
    "in other words , are there differences between lattice models and langevin equations ?",
    "we consider two lattice models and three representative values of diffusion , in order to exemplify the low , intermediate and large regimes .",
    "models will be studied via mft and distinct kinds of numerical simulations ( explained further ) .",
    "results suggest that the discontinuous transition is maintained in both models for all diffusion values . also , a finite - size scaling behavior similar to discontinuous transitions studied in ref .",
    "@xcite has been found . since there is no theory for the nonequilibrium case",
    ", our results can shed light over a general finite - size scaling for them .",

    "ii presents the models and mean - field analysis .",
    "iii shows the numerical results and finally conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "let us consider systems of interacting particles placed on a square lattice of linear size @xmath1 .",
    "each site has an occupation variable @xmath2 that assumes the value @xmath3 whenever sites are empty ( occupied ) .",
    "the model a is defined by the following interaction rules : particles are annihilated with rate @xmath4 and are created in empty sites only if their number of nearest neighbor particles @xmath5 is larger than 1 ( @xmath6 ) , with rate @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "there is no particle creation if @xmath8 . the model",
    "b is similar to the model a , but the particle creation rate always reads @xmath9 , provided @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus , whenever particles are created with rate proportional to the number of their nearest neighbors for the model a , it is independent on @xmath5 in the model b. besides the above creation - annihilation dynamics , each particle also hops to one of its nearest neighbor sites with probability @xmath10 , provided it is empty . in the regime of low annihilation parameters ,",
    "the system exhibits indefinite activity in which particles are continuously created and destroyed .",
    "in contrast , for larger @xmath4 s , the system is constrained in the absorbing phase .",
    "the phase transition separates above regimes at a transition point @xmath11 . in the absence of diffusion , the phase transitions for both models a and b are discontinuous and occur at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the first inspection of the effect of diffusion can be achieved by performing mean - field analysis .",
    "the starting point is to write down the time evolution of relevant quantities from the interaction rules and truncating the associated probabilities at a given level .",
    "since the diffusion conserves the number of particles , it is required to take into account at least correlations of two sites and hence two equations are needed . designating the symbols @xmath14 and @xmath15 to represent occupied ( @xmath16 ) and",
    "( @xmath17 ) empty sites , the system density @xmath18 corresponds to the one - site probability @xmath19 .",

    "the pair mean - field approximation consists of rewriting the @xmath31-site probabilities ( @xmath32 ) as products of two - site in such a way that @xmath33 from this approximation , the above equations read @xmath34 @xmath35+\\nonumber\\\\ [ 0.2 cm ] & & + d\\left[6u-\\frac{6u^{2}}{\\rho(1-\\rho)}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the model a and @xmath36 @xmath37+\\nonumber\\\\ [ 0.2 cm ] & & + d\\left[6u-\\frac{6u^{2}}{\\rho(1-\\rho)}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the model b.    the steady solutions are obtained by taking @xmath38 implying that for locating the transition point and the order of transition it is required to solve a system of two coupled equations for a given set of parameters ( @xmath4,@xmath10 ) . although alternative treatments have been considered @xcite , here we shall identify the order of transitions by inspecting the dependence of @xmath18 vs @xmath4 . in similarity with equilibrium transitions , the existence of a spinodal behavior ( with @xmath18 increasing by raising @xmath4 ) signals a discontinuous transition . despite this , no analogous treatments similar to the `` maxwell construction '' are available .",

    "mean - field results predict discontinuous transitions separating the absorbing and the active phases .",

    "dotted lines correspond to spinodal behaviors , being replaced here by a jump . ]",
    "numerical simulations have been performed for distinct system sizes of a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions . due to the lack of a general theory for discontinuous absorbing transitions , including the absence of a finite - size scaling ( fss ) theory and unknown spreading experiments behavior for @xmath56 , two sort of analysis will be presented . in the former ,",
    "we study the time decay of the density @xmath18 starting from a fully occupied initial condition for distinct independent runs . as for critical and discontinuous phase transitions , for small @xmath4",

    "briefly , it consists of storing a list of @xmath61 active configurations ( here we store @xmath62 configurations ) and whenever the system falls into the absorbing state a configuration is randomly extracted from the list .",

    "@xcite in the regime of low diffusion rates , although they agree qualitatively in the limit of intermediate and large diffusion regimes .",
    "a possible explanation for such differences is presented as follows : as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a coarse - grained description of a discontinuous absorbing transition is the differential equation @xmath108 , where @xmath109 corresponds to the diffusion term and @xmath110 is the ( white ) noise .",

    "it is worth remarking that further studies are still required to confirm above points .    despite the similarities between models a and b , some differences are clearly observed . in particular , as predicted by the mft , compact clusters are somewhat less dense for model b than for model a. also , the dependence between @xmath10 and @xmath4 in both models is somewhat different . extending the aforementioned analysis for distinct values of @xmath10 , we obtain the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for both models , in the limit @xmath48",
    "the transition points approach their values predicted by the mft .     obtained from mc simulations for the models a ( left ) and b ( right ) . dashed line denotes discontinuous phase transitions . ]",
    "to sum up , we investigated the influence of diffusion in two simple models presenting discontinuous absorbing phase transitions .",
    "they have been studied via mean - field analysis and distinct numerical simulations .",
    "all results suggest that transitions are discontinuous irrespective the strength of the diffusion , in contrast to recent findings in which limited diffusion induces a critical transition @xcite .",
    "thus our results indicate not only an additional feature of diffusion , but also the possible differences between lattice model and langevin approaches .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the study of other models variants ( taking into account the inclusion of distinct annihilation rates ) are required for checking whether the disagreement between approaches is also verified in other cases .",
    "other remarkable result is that all transitions presented a finite - size scaling ( with the system volume ) similar to the discontinuous transitions studied in ref .",
