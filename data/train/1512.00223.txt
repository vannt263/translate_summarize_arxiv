    "the notion of quantum mechanics violating local realism was first raised by the work of a. einstein , b. podolsky and n. rosen @xcite .",
    "this was put on a rigorous and general footing by the revolutionary 1964 paper of j.  s.  bell  @xcite , which derived an inequality ( now known as the bell inequality ) involving correlations of two observables .",
    "bell showed that there is a constraint on any possible correlations obtained from local hidden variable models which can be violated by quantum measurements of entangled states .",
    "later on , another bell - type inequality which is more experimentally feasible was derived by j. f. clauser , m. a. horne , a. shimony and r. a. holt @xcite . since then",
    ", bell inequalities have played a fundamental role in quantum theory and have had many applications in quantum information science ( see @xcite for a review ) .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the maximal violation of chsh - bell inequality @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the _ tsirelson bound _",
    "@xmath0 for chsh - bell inequality , which is the ratio of quantum and classical value , was first obtained by tsirelson @xcite .",
    "he also proved that the bound can be realized by using proper pauli observables .",
    "apart from above qubit case , it is possible to find dichotomic observables in high dimension @xcite , as well as in continuous variable ( infinite dimension ) case @xcite , to obtain the tsirelson bound .",
    "recently , y. c. liang et .",
    "@xcite have studied the possibility of violation of chsh - bell inequality by random observables . for bipartite",
    "qubits case , if two observers share a bell state , they showed that the probability of violation is about @xmath1 by randomly choosing measurement settings .",
    "however , their work does not involve the probability of the maximal violation .",
    "so it is natural to ask following question : _ is it possible to maximally violate chsh - bell inequality by using random observables with high probability ? _ in this work , we will provide an affirmative answer to this question by using random observables in sufficient large dimensional hilbert space .",
    "thus in this asymptotic sense , maximally violating chsh - bell inequality is _ generic _ for random observables . on the other hand , in all known results the specific algebraic relations , namely , anti - commuting relations between the observables play an important role for the tsirelson bound of chsh - bell inequality .",
    "however , this random approach reveals that there is another type of algebraic relations between observables which might lead to the tsirelson bound of chsh - bell inequality .",
    "we call the observables , which satisfy those relations , _ free observables .",
    "_ it originates from a mathematical theory , called free probability @xcite .",
    "in fact , due to the mathematical terminology , those free observables are freely independent in some quantum probability space .",
    "a crucial point is that free observables can only exist in infinite dimension .",
    "thus from this viewpoint it may go beyond the experimental realization . to be applicable for experiment , we are able to construct dichotomic observables by truncating some given free observables into finite dimension , by which the tsirelson bound can be approximately obtained .",
    "in another part of this work we have studied the fine - grained uncertainty relations of free or random observables , which was introduced by j. oppenheim and s. wehner @xcite .",
    "it is more fundamental than the usual entropic uncertainty relations and it relates to the degree of violation of bell inequalities ( non - local games ) @xcite . for a pair of free ( random ) observables , we can show that the degree of their uncertainty is 0 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting that for a sequence of free ( random ) observables @xmath2 the fine - grained uncertainty is upper bounded by @xmath3 which is the same as the one given by the anti - commuting observables .",
    "therefore as a byproduct of above results , by using free ( random ) observables we can obtain one type of steering inequality with large violation that recently be studied in @xcite .",
    "firstly , we need the following terminology : for a typical bipartite dichotomic bell scenario , we usually suppose there are two observers , say , alice and bob , which are separated at a long distance .",
    "suppose each of them is described by a @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space @xmath5 and alice ( resp .",
    "bob ) chooses one of @xmath6 dichotomic observables @xmath7 ( resp .",
    "@xmath8 ) that will take results @xmath9 ( resp .",
    "@xmath10 ) from set @xmath11 thus mathematically the dichotomic observables are required to be self - adjoint unitaries .    let us recall the famous chsh - bell inequality @xcite , which plays an important role in experiments for verifying bell non - locality .",
    "@xmath12 where the _ classical value _ 2 is obtained by all local hidden variable model . in @xcite ,",
    "tsirelson first proved that if the correlations are obtained by quantum theory then the _ quantum value _ of chsh - bell inequality is @xmath13 .",
    "in other words , let us consider the following chsh - bell operator @xmath14 where @xmath15 are dichotomic observables . by choosing proper observables , e.g. @xmath16",
    "the norm ( the maximal eigenvalue ) of the chsh - bell operator is @xmath17 let us denote @xmath18 then @xmath19 \\otimes [ b_1 , b_2].\\ ] ] if both parties choose compatible ( commutative ) observables , then @xmath20 hence incompatible ( non - commutative ) observables are necessary for the violation of chsh - bell inequality @xcite . regarding to the tsirelson bound ,",
    "it is determined by the eigenvalues of the commutators @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22.$ ] more precisely , suppose the local dimension for each party is @xmath23 and the eigenvalues of @xmath21 $ ] ( resp .",
    "@xmath22 $ ] ) are @xmath24 ( resp .",
    "@xmath25 ) .",
    "then we have @xcite : @xmath26 it is clear that if there exist eigenstates such that the eigenvalues of @xmath21 $ ] ( resp .",
    "@xmath22 $ ] ) are @xmath27 then @xmath28 therefore , the tsirelson bound is sufficiently determined by the algebraic relations of local observables .",
    "for example , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are anti - commutative dichotomic observables .",
    "suppose @xmath31 is a @xmath32 deterministic diagonal matrix , where the diagonal terms of @xmath31 are either @xmath33 or @xmath34 technically we can assume @xmath35 it is easy to see that @xmath36 suppose unitaries @xmath37 are independent random matrices in the group of unitary matrices @xmath38 @xmath39 s are called haar random unitaries . define the random dichotomic observables as follows : @xmath40 since a random matrix is a matrix whose entries are real or complex random variables on a given probability space @xmath41 the results we considered should hold with `` high probability '' .",
    "recall that we call a sequence of random variables @xmath42 convergent to @xmath43 almost surely in probability space @xmath41 if @xmath44 with these notions , we claim that the tsirelson bound of chsh - bell inequality can be obtained in high probability by using random dichotomic observables in sufficient large dimension .",
    "more precisely , we have following theorem :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 are independent haar random unitaries in @xmath48 then we have @xmath49    to prove this theorem , we first need following lemma in @xcite :    [ lem : c - norm ] let @xmath50 be the set of @xmath51 matrices , then for every @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54    now denote @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56.$ ] for any @xmath57 by binomial formula and equation , we have @xmath58    let us consider the term @xmath59 since @xmath60 and @xmath61 commute , again by binomial formula , we have @xmath62    now we need the second key lemma ( see appendix b for the details of proof ) :    [ lem : key ] let @xmath63 where @xmath64 are independent haar random unitaries , then we have @xmath65 where the indices @xmath66 satisfy following conditions : @xmath67    basically this lemma belongs to b. collins , since it is a natural corollary of his work in @xcite , where he and other co - authors developed a method to calculate the moments of polynomial random variables on unitary groups .",
    "it is called weingarten calculus due to the work of weingarten @xcite .",
    "in fact , this lemma reveals the asymptotic freeness of random matrices , which means the moments of free random variables in some quantum probability space can be approximated by the ones of random matrices ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "thus by lemma [ lem : key ] , for almost surely we have @xmath68 the similar estimate is also valid for the term @xmath69 therefore @xmath70 by stirling s formula , we have @xmath71 hence let @xmath72 we can choose @xmath73 such that @xmath74 since @xmath75 for all @xmath76 then we have @xmath77 on the other hand , due to tsirelson s result @xcite we have @xmath78 .",
    "thus we complete our proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "in fact , the random dichotomic observables are `` asymptotic '' freely independent , which was first established by voiculescu @xcite in the case of gaussian unitary ensembles ( gue ) .",
    "that result builds a gorgeous bridge across two distinct mathematical branches  random matrix theory and free probability . in free probability theory",
    ", we will treat observables @xmath79 as elements of a @xmath80-algebra @xmath81 equipped with an unital ( faithful ) state @xmath82 where unital means @xmath83 and faithful means @xmath84 the pair @xmath85 is called a @xmath80-probability space , which is a quantum analogue of a classical probability space . for example , @xmath86 is a @xmath80-probability space , where @xmath50 is the set of @xmath51 matrices .",
    "lemma [ lem : key ] inspires us to consider the following adaptation of definition of freeness to the case of dichotomic observables :    [ def : freeness ] for given @xmath80-probability space @xmath87 dichotomic observables @xmath88 are called freely independent , if @xmath89 whenever we have following :    1 .   @xmath90 is positive ; @xmath91 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath92 for all @xmath90 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath67    for the special case @xmath93 the above conditions are equivalent to @xmath94    however , if the local hilbert dimension is finite , there does not exist such observables which are freely independent .",
    "in other words , for fixed @xmath23 the @xmath80-probability space @xmath95 is too small to talk about freeness , and definition [ def : freeness ] is empty since such observables in @xmath96 do not exist .",
    "but fortunately if we consider the observables in infinite dimensional hilbert space , it is possible for them to be freely independent in some @xmath80-probability space @xmath97 on the other hand , the derivations in section [ sec - random ] do not depend on the dimension , i.e , the derivations still hold when we use an infinite dimensional @xmath80-probability space @xmath98 instead of @xmath99 and there is a formula which is corresponding to lemma [ lem : c - norm ] ( see equation ) .",
    "thus we have following conclusion :    [ thm : main ] for chsh - bell inequality , the tsirelson bound can be obtained by using the observables which are freely independent in their respective local system .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath100 and @xmath101 are freely independent in some @xmath80-probability space @xmath87 then we have @xmath102    in next subsection , we will provide a concrete example which fulfill the conditions in this theorem .      for infinite dimensional @xmath80-probability space , definition",
    "[ def : freeness ] is meaningful .",
    "now consider a group @xmath103 and its associate hilbert space @xmath104 the set @xmath105 forms an orthonormal basis of @xmath106 thus the dimension of @xmath107 is infinite .",
    "let @xmath108 be left regular group representation , which is defined as : @xmath109 the reduced @xmath80-algebra @xmath110 is defined as the norm closure of the linear span @xmath111 where the norm is the operator norm of @xmath112 there is a faithful trace state @xmath113 on @xmath110 defined as @xmath114 obviously @xmath115 hence @xmath116 is a @xmath80-probability space .",
    "let @xmath117 be the generator of @xmath118-th copy of @xmath119 and let @xmath120 it is easy to check @xmath121 are self - adjoint unitaries and freely independent in @xmath122 . hence",
    "if the local hilbert spaces of alice and bob are taken to be @xmath106 where @xmath123 by using those free observables , we can obtain the quantum value @xmath13 for chsh - bell inequality .",
    "note here the unitary operation maintains the freeness of observables , i.e , if @xmath100 are freely independent , then @xmath124 are still freely independent for any unitary @xmath125 .",
    "since the norm of bell operator does not change under the local unitary operation , we can simply assume @xmath126      in order to see how the freeness behaves in a simple and direct way , we will truncate the free observables given by last subsection to finite dimension .",
    "denote the elements in @xmath127 as following diagram : @xmath128 with above notation , we have @xmath129    let us truncate the free observables to @xmath130 dimension .",
    "we denote them as @xmath131 and @xmath132",
    ". then we have ( see figure 1 ) : @xmath133 and @xmath134     and the dash lines stands for @xmath132 , where @xmath135.,height=151 ]    it is clear that @xmath131 and @xmath132 are self - adjoint unitaries .",
    "thus they can be treated as a pair of dichotomic observables in @xmath4 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "denote @xmath136 then we have @xmath137    by following diagram it is easy to see that @xmath138 is a cyclic in the permutation group @xmath139 @xmath140    now for the chsh - bell operator @xmath141 by using those truncated free observables , we can show that the quantum value tends to @xmath13 as @xmath142 then due to the fact that the eigenvalues of @xmath138 are @xmath143 we have @xmath144 \\otimes [ a_1^{(n ) } , a_2^{(n)}]\\right\\|\\\\ & = \\left\\| 4 { 1\\mkern -4mu{\\rm l}}- ( s^\\dagger - s ) \\otimes ( s^\\dagger -s ) \\right\\| \\\\ & = \\max_j \\ { 4 + 4 ( \\im(\\lambda_j))^2 \\ } = \\max_j \\left\\ { 4 + 4 \\sin^2{\\frac{2\\pi j}{n } } \\right\\}\\\\ & \\thickapprox 4 + 4 \\left(1- o\\left(\\frac{1}{n^2}\\right)\\right ) = 8 - o\\left ( \\frac{1}{n^2 } \\right ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    here for simplicity , we have assumed that alice and bob take same measurements .",
    "therefore , we have following proposition :    [ prop : cut ] by using truncated free observables @xmath145 we can asymptotically obtain the tsirelson bound for chsh - bell inequality , i.e , @xmath146",
    "uncertainty principle and non - locality , which are two fundamental and intrinsic concepts of quantum theory , was quantitatively linked by j. oppenheim and s. wehner s work @xcite , where they introduced a notion called `` fine - grained uncertainty relations '' to quantify the `` amount of uncertainty '' in a particular physical theory . in dichotomic scenario , suppose we have @xmath6 dichotomic observables @xmath147 thus the corresponding measurement settings are @xmath148 the uncertainty of measurement settings @xmath149 is defined as following : @xmath150 similarly , the uncertainty of @xmath151 is @xmath152 noticed that @xmath153 hence @xmath154 the state @xmath155 which can obtain @xmath156 is called the maximally certain state for those measurement settings .",
    "if we assume @xmath7 are freely independent observables , then we have following proposition ( see appendix c and d for the proof ) :    [ prop : uncertainty - free ] the fine - grained uncertainty for free observables @xmath157 is @xmath158 the same results hold for random observables @xmath159 with high probability .    for the special case @xmath160 we have @xmath161 thus for @xmath160 @xmath162 ( see appendix d for random observables and appendix e for free obervables ) .",
    "interestingly , for truncated free observables we have @xmath163 thus for the truncated free observables , we always have @xmath164 regardless of what dimension we truncate to .    in a recent work ,",
    "some of us show that there is a tight relationship between fine - grained uncertainty and violation of one specific steering inequalities , called linear steering inequality , which was first used in @xcite to verify steering by experiment .",
    "it has following form : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is called the _ local hidden state",
    "_ bound of @xmath167 this bound can be calculated easily as follows @xcite : @xmath168 if the observables @xmath7 are chosen to be operators of clifford algebra , which are anti - commutative , a large ( unbounded ) violation can be obtained @xcite .",
    "because the degree of the fine - grained uncertainty of free or random observables is as the same order of anti - commuting observables , thus we can make following conclusion :    if @xmath169 are chosen to be free observables , then the local hidden state bound of steering inequality @xmath170 is upper bounded by @xmath171 the similar result holds for random observables with high probability .    here",
    "we note that for the free case , we should also care about the quantum values of steering inequalities . due to m. navascus and d. prez - garc s work , there are two different ways to define them @xcite .",
    "one is in a commuting way that means the system described by a total hilbert space , and the other one is the total system described in a tensor form . as a matter of fact",
    ", they also used the free observables @xmath172 to define the linear steering inequality .",
    "they showed the quantum value defined in the commuting sense is @xmath173 while in the tensor scenario is upper bounded by @xmath174 so by their work , we can easily see that the local hidden state bound is upper bounded by @xmath175 for free observables .",
    "their bound is even sharper than ours .",
    "however , we have provided another proof which is more focus on the freeness property and is applicable to random observables .",
    "in this paper , we are able to obtain the tsirelson bound for chsh - bell inequality by using random dichotomic observables . in other wards , we have shown that maximally violating chsh - bell inequality is generic for random observables .",
    "different to the known results , random observables do not satisfy anti - commuting relations .",
    "instead , due to voiculescu s theory , they are asymptotic freely independent .",
    "it means when the dimension increases , their behaviors tends to the ones of free observables in some quantum probability space .",
    "another main result of this paper is that we have considered the fine - grained uncertainty of a sequence of free or random observables .",
    "the degree of their uncertainty is as the same order as the one which is given by the anti - commuting observables . as a byproduct of this result",
    ", we can construct a linear steering inequality with large violation by using free or random observables .",
    "for further applications , free observables may be used for studying the quantum value of other type of bell inequalities .",
    "thus a natural question arises : _ is it free observables always maximally violate any bell inequalities ? _ unfortunately , a quick answer is that we can consider the linear bell operator @xmath176 it is trivial since its quantum and classical value are both @xmath173 while the quantum value given by free observables is upper bounded by @xmath177 .",
    "however , it seems promising when considering other specific bell inequalities .",
    "since the free observables and their truncated ones are deterministic ( constructive ) , another possible application is that it may reverse what we have done in some problems where the random approach are known while the constructive one are unknown .",

    "@xmath247 it is easy to see that @xmath248 is equal to the cardinality of the set @xmath249 due to shrink process , @xmath242 only if there is even number of elements for every block .",
    "those partitions with even elements in every block can be realized in following process : first choosing an arbitrary non - crossing pair partition , then combining some proper blocks to one block .",
    "hence the number of @xmath242 is upper bounded by @xmath250 thus @xmath251 therefore under our assumption , @xmath252    _ note _",
    ": for the local hidden state bound @xmath166 of steering inequality @xmath253 in equation , the variables @xmath9 do not make any effort to the whole derivation .",
    "thus @xmath166 is also upper bounded by @xmath171      in fact , the statement is a corollary of the work of b. collins and c. male @xcite . here",
    "we restate their result as following : let @xmath63 then there exist @xmath80-probability space @xmath85 and haar unitaries @xmath196 which are freely independent of element @xmath254 such that @xmath255              [ [ sub : uncertainty ] ] maximally certain states for @xmath267 and @xmath268 in the case @xmath269 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                for instance , group @xmath287 is amenable .",
    "hence by above proposition , @xmath288 with above notions , we can formally define a state @xmath289 where @xmath290 is a flner sequence of @xmath291 now we have : @xmath292 where for the second equation we have used the property of flner sequence .",
    "thus in this approximate sense , the fine - grained uncertainty of @xmath293 and @xmath294 is 1 .",
    "technically we can construct @xmath295 to approximate @xmath296 firstly we define two subsets of @xmath297 @xmath298 in fact , @xmath299 ( resp .",
    "@xmath300 ) is the subset of wards which begin with @xmath301 ( resp .",
    "@xmath302 ) .",
    "it is easy to see @xmath303 now we define a state : @xmath304 where @xmath290 is still a flner sequence of @xmath305 and @xmath306 let @xmath307 then we have @xmath308    for the first of term of right hand side , for large enough @xmath173 we can say @xmath309 therefore @xmath310 for large enough @xmath311 then we have @xmath312 where for the second equation we have used .",
    "a similar argument is valid for the second term of right hand side of .",
    "thus finally we have @xmath313      in this appendix we will consider a bell inequality which has a similar form of chsh - bell inequality .",
    "the bell operator is defined as follows : @xmath314 where @xmath315 here the observables are not dichotomic .",
    "instead , there are three possible outcomes : @xmath316 thus @xmath79 are required to be unitaries and satisfy @xmath317 for any @xmath318 the classical value of this bell functional is @xmath319    now for the quantum value , we can assume @xmath320 and @xmath100 are freely independent in some @xmath80-probability space .",
    "hence we have @xmath321 where @xmath322 by binomial formula we have @xmath323 on one hand , by stirling s formula , for even @xmath324",
    "@xmath325 thus @xmath326 by lemma [ lem : c - norm ] , we have @xmath327 by a slightly adaption of the results in @xcite , where they provided a method to estimate the quantum value for given dichotomic bell inequalities , we can conclude that @xmath328 is an upper bound for the quantum value of complex chsh bell inequality .",
