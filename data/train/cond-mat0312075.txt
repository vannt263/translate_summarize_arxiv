    "perovskite oxide superlattices are expected to have properties distinct from those of the bulk constituents .",
    "due to lattice mismatch , constituent layers below the critical thickness generally are in highly strained states . as can be confirmed by first - principles studies of bulk materials , the lattice instabilities and properties of bulk perovskites are extremely sensitive to the strain state .",
    "the degree of strain can be further tuned by varying the lattice constant of the substrate on which the superlattice is grown .",
    "this discussion is of practical interest as it has been shown that perovskite oxide superlattices can indeed be grown with atomic scale precision @xcite , opening up a highly varied family of artificially structured materials for investigation .",
    "thus , first - principles prediction of superlattice properties can directly lead to productive interactions with experimentalists and progress in materials design@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider the simplest possible ( and as yet hypothetical ) [ 001]-(pbtio@xmath0)@xmath2(pbzro@xmath0)@xmath3 superlattice with @xmath4=1 and @xmath5=1 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_supercell ] , this consists of single unit cell layers of pbzro@xmath0 ( pz ) and pbtio@xmath0 ( pt ) alternating along [ 001 ] . the equilibrium cubic lattice constant of bulk pz is significantly greater than that of pt , with the computed values being @xmath6=7.77 a.u . and @xmath7=7.37 a.u . ,",
    "leading to a 5% mismatch ( the corresponding experimental values are 7.81 a.u . , 7.50 a.u , and 4% ) . at their equilibrium lattice constants ,",
    "both cubic pt and cubic pz have an unstable three - fold degenerate polar phonon mode at the zone center .",
    "the lattice mismatch means that in the superlattice , pz is under compressive in - plane stress , while pt is under tensile in - plane stress .",
    "if the structure is allowed to relax without breaking the central mirror plane symmetry ( i.e. in space group p4/mmm ) , the in - plane lattice constant takes an intermediate value of 7.57 a.u .. the pz unit cell elongates , giving a local tetragonal unit cell with @xmath8 @xmath9 1 , and conversely , the pt unit cell will shorten , resulting in a local tetragonal unit cell with @xmath8 @xmath10 1 .",
    "this lowering of unit cell symmetry leads to a splitting of the three - fold degenerate unstable mode in each layer , with the lower frequency mode(s ) along the long direction(s ) .",
    "thus , on qualitative grounds , one expects at least two unstable @xmath11 modes of different symmetry , one associated with polarization along the normal in the pz layer , and a second , two - fold degenerate , mode producing polarization in the plane of the pt layer .",
    "dfpt calculations of the phonon dispersion of the relaxed centrosymmetric superlattice show two unstable zone - center polar modes , one with in - plane polarization confined in the pt layer and the other with polarization along the normal confined in the pz layer , quantitatively confirming this picture @xcite .",
    "the energy of the system can be lowered by either of these modes alone ; the actual ground state might involve choosing one , or the other , or coupling both together .",

    "have very large values .",
    "this is attributed to the low energy for polarization rotation ; this mechanism was first suggested to explain the high piezoelectric response of single crystal pmn - pt @xcite and accounts for the enhancement not only of the piezoelectric response in the monoclinic phase of the superlattice , but also , as we will show below , for the enhancement of the dielectric response .    under an epitaxial constraint imposed by a cubic [ 001 ] substrate ,",
    "the in - plane lattice vectors are equal in length and make an angle of 90 degrees , while the system is otherwise free to relax .",

    "compatible k - point sampling allows us directly to compare the energies of these structures . although the angle @xmath35 between the c axis and the plane can in principle vary , in the total energy calculations it is held fixed at 90 degrees to simplify the calculation .",
    "the main effect of this approximation is to reduce the range of stability of the r - phase as a function of in - plane strain ; for the systems considered here , we describe below how we compute the effect of strain through analysis of the hessian matrix .",

    "optimization in the monoclinic space group corresponding to the r - phase produces either the c - phase or the aa - phase depending on in - plane strain ; these energies lie very slightly higher than those obtained by optimizing in the tetragonal space groups , reflecting the convergence criterion for the relaxation .",

    "it can be seen that the effect of the additional strain relaxation introduces a narrow region of stability of the r - phase , between in - plane strains of 0.86@xmath41 and 1.48@xmath41 .",
    "this window of 0.62@xmath41 is about three times smaller than the t=0 width of 2@xmath41 obtained by pertsev et al.,@xcite the latter being an extrapolation to low temperature of a landau theory fit near the paraelectric - ferroelectric transition temperatures above 700 k.      next , we investigate the relation of the ground state structure to the zone - center phonon modes in the centrosymmetric reference structure . in the unstrained superlattice ( @xmath15=7.57 a.u . )",

    "this is consistent with the qualitative picture discussed in the introduction , with the mode with polarization along the normal being raised in frequency by increasing in - plane lattice constant , while the in - plane mode softens .",
    "the ground state structure reflects these opposing trends in the strength of the two unstable modes .",

    "[ fig_dielectric](b ) and ( d ) ) , the behavior of the dielectric constant in the c and aa phases is rather similar to that in the superlattice , with a near - divergence in @xmath47 as the boundary of the aa - phase is approached . however , comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig_dielectric](a ) and ( b ) show that the enhancement of the r - phase in the superlattice gives a large @xmath47 over a much larger range of epitaxial strain .",
    "the most striking features of the phase diagram of the epitaxially constrained [ 001]-(pbtio@xmath0)@xmath1(pbzro@xmath0)@xmath1 superlattice are the width of the r - phase , the separation of the minimum energy in - plane lattice constants of the c and aa - phases , and the linearity of the energy with in - plane strain in the r - phase .",

    "certain components of the dielectric tensor diverge as the phase boundaries are approached . while the polarization induced by an electric field along the direction of the spontaneous polarization",
    "is rather modest , the noncollinear responses are of great interest .",
    "this polarization rotation mechanism , through the coupling of polarization and strain , has been invoked to explain the large piezoelectric response in single - crystal relaxors @xcite , and to explain the large piezoelectric response computed for ordered pzt ( with the same structure as the superlattice considered here ) in ref .  .",
    "the r - phase , with its continuously variable direction for the spontaneous polarization , is expected to have particularly large responses . in particular , the @xmath58 component of @xmath48 , the normal polarization induced by a field along the normal , will be enhanced by a noncollinear contribution throughout the r - phase .    finally , we consider the origin of the different behavior of the two systems . first , we discuss the difference in equilibrium lattice constant of the c - phase and the aa - phase . in a simple perovskite , such as pure pt",

    "greater , leading to a separation of the first - principles lattice constants of the two phases about twice as large as in the model .",
    "this deviation from a simple elastic energy model might be due to the thinness of the individual layers and/or to the importance of inter - layer interactions beyond lattice matching .",
    "the stability of the r - phase is favored by in - plane and perpendicular unstable polar modes having both a similar strength and positive anharmonic coupling . in a simple perovskite , such as pure pt , tetragonal",
    "strain splits the three - fold degenerate mode to give a dominant unstable @xmath43 mode for @xmath8 less than 1 , and a dominant in - plane @xmath59 mode for @xmath8 greater than 1 .",
    "if the ground state is obtained by freezing in only the dominant unstable mode , we expect a discontinuous change in character at the in - plane lattice constant corresponding to the lowest - energy cubic structure , as seen in pt",
    ". even if the strengths of the two modes are similar , the fourth order anharmonic term coupling them must be large enough to favor this combination over the higher - symmetry structures ( z , as in the c - phase , or along [ 110 ] as in the aa - phase ) .",
    "its magnitude can vary greatly from material to material , being enhanced by coupling to particular types of strain , especially shear strain .    in the superlattice",

    "this idealized picture will be somewhat modified by electrostatic considerations , which will tend to minimize the divergence of * p * by polarizing the pt layer along the z direction .",
    "the usefulness of this simple picture lies in its applicability to longer period pt / pz superlattices ; such systems are also of interest as they are accessible to experimental investigation .",

    "<S> the effect of layer - by - layer heterostructuring and epitaxial strain on lattice instabilities and related ferroelectric properties is investigated from first principles for the [ 001]-(pbtio@xmath0)@xmath1(pbzro@xmath0)@xmath1 superlattice and pure pbtio@xmath0 on a cubic substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the superlattice show an enhancement of the stability of the monoclinic r - phase with respect to pure pbtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the lattice instabilities of the relaxed centrosymmetric reference structure computed within density functional perturbation theory suggests that this results from the presence of two unstable zone - center modes , one confined in the pbtio@xmath0 layer and one in the pbzro@xmath0 layer , which produce in - plane and normal components of the polarization , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - temperature dielectric response is computed and shown to be enhanced not only near the phase boundaries , but throughout the r - phase . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the analogous calculation for pure pbtio@xmath0 is consistent with this interpretation , and suggests useful approaches to engineering the dielectric properties of artificially structured perovskite oxides . </S>"
