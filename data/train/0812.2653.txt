    "coherent pion production off nuclei , e.g. in @xmath2 constitutes an especially interesting subsample not only because it is a significant background to the @xmath3 oscillation search but also because it is deeply rooted in fundamental physics via adler s pcac theorem  @xcite which connects forward neutrino scattering with the pion nucleon cross section .",

    "as usual @xmath9 denotes the four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath10 while @xmath11 for a hadronic system with invariant mass @xmath12 emerging from a nucleus or nucleon with mass @xmath13 .",
    "the kinematical factors @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 .",
    "the cross sections @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 stands for _ left , right , scalar _ ) are unknown functions of @xmath18 and @xmath12 which have to be measured or calculated in theoretical models .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath19 only the term with @xmath20 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) survives because the overall factor @xmath18 is compensated by a factor @xmath21 in the scalar cross section . in this limit pcac",

    "the resulting formula for forward inelastic neutrino scattering is denotes the laboratory angle of the outgoing lepton . ]",
    "@xmath25 in the presence of lepton mass @xmath26 there is a correction to this formula caused by the pion pole term in the hadronic axial vector current . including , in addition , an axial vector form factor @xmath27 to describe the variation of the cross section at small values of @xmath18 around the forward direction , one obtains the result given by kopeliovich and marage  @xcite @xmath28\\sigma_{\\pi n}\\enspace , \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the high energy approximation to the true minimal @xmath18 .",
    "the axial vector form factor @xmath30 is defined by @xmath31 with a typical value for the axial vector meson mass @xmath32 of 0.95 gev ; see however the extensive discussion in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the first term inside the rectangular brackets of ( [ eq:4 ] ) corresponds to outgoing muons with negative helicity ( helicity nonflip ) whereas the second term is the helicity flip contribution which vanishes at @xmath33 scattering angle .",
    "this helicity structure was also found by adler  @xcite and piketty and stodolsky  @xcite . with @xmath34",
    "the expression inside the rectangular brackets represents the _ adler screening factor _ which was invoked in  @xcite as a possible explanation of the dip in cc reactions at low @xmath18 , resulting from the destructive interference of the pion pole .    for neutrino scattering off nuclei @xmath35 the coherent pion channel",
    "@xmath36 has special interest , since the pcac formula ( [ eq:4 ] ) predicts the cross section to be proportional to the elastic cross section @xmath37 .",
    "this hadronic process is strongly enhanced in the forward direction because of the coherent action of the @xmath38 nucleons in the nucleus , with an amplitude @xmath39 at @xmath33 scattering angle .",
    "this effect then implies the enhancement of forward going pions in the neutrino reaction , which is a characteristic signature of coherent pion production , distinguishing it from possible incoherent backgrounds .",
    "an early analysis of pion production by neutrinos , that included a discussion of the kinematical region termed coherent , was given in  @xcite .",
    "in the following we investigate in more detail coherent single pion production . assuming that the derivation given above also holds for the differential cross section one gets for the cc reaction @xmath40 @xmath41 \\nonumber\\\\ \\times \\frac{d\\sigma ( \\pi^+ n\\to\\pi^+ n)}{dt } \\label{eq:6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the modulus of the four - momentum transfer squared between incoming virtual boson and outgoing pion . for calculating the nc reaction @xmath43 one has to set @xmath44 and divide the right hand side of the resulting equation by 2 , because @xmath45 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath46 for isoscalar targets @xmath47 equals @xmath48 .    in the widely used rein - sehgal ( rs ) model  @xcite the kinematical factors on the right hand side of ( [ eq:7 ] )",
    "have been evaluated for @xmath49 resulting in the simpler expression @xmath50 for the cross section .",
    "we have compared ( [ eq:7 ] ) to ( [ eq:8 ] ) by performing a monte carlo integration using the illustrative ansatz @xmath51 with energy independent coefficients @xmath52 mb and @xmath53 gev@xmath54 for elastic @xmath1 or @xmath0 scattering off carbon nuclei .",
    "( this ansatz will be motivated in the next section . )",
    "the result of the integration is shown in fig.[fig1]a where the ratio @xmath55 is plotted versus the energy of the incoming neutrino .",
    "here @xmath56 stands for the integral of ( [ eq:7 ] ) and @xmath57 for the integral of ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "this figure demonstrates that at low energies the neutrino cross section is substantially reduced by using the complete kinematical factors of ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "we also compared @xmath0 production to @xmath1 production by integrating ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) using identical form factors and pion nucleus cross sections .",
    "apart from the factor @xmath58 one would naively expect a ratio of 2 according to the ratio of the pion decay constants .",
    "fig.[fig1]b shows however a remarkable violation of this isospin symmetry due to lepton mass effects contained in ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "the dominant cause for the variation observed in the figure is the reduced phase space of cc reactions .",
    "the adler screening factor reduces the cc cross section by further 10% at @xmath59 gev and 4% at @xmath60 gev .",
    "the influence of the numerical value of @xmath32 on the cross section ratio is neglegible .",
    "even setting @xmath34 changes the ratio by less then 2% .",
    "in @xcite a model has been presented which calculates elastic pion nucleus scattering from pion nucleon scattering via @xmath61 here the pion on the left hand side can be charged or neutral .",
    "the differential elastic pion nucleon cross section in forward direction on the right hand side is determined via the optical theorem ( neglecting a possible real part of the scattering amplitude ) @xmath62 and the slope @xmath63 of the exponential @xmath42-distribution is taken from the optical model relation @xmath64 with e.g. @xmath65 fm .",
    "@xmath66 describes the average attenuation of a pion emerging from a sphere of nuclear matter with radius @xmath67 resulting in @xmath68 with @xmath69    as an example we calculate the total elastic pion carbon cross section via @xmath70 the total pion nucleon cross sections are available as computer readable files  @xcite .",
    "the data were fitted by a superposition of breit wigner functions and a regge inspired term @xmath71 with @xmath72 denoting the pion laboratory momentum .",
    "a similar fit to the elastic cross sections finally yields @xmath73 which is used for calculation of @xmath66 .    the dotted line of fig.[fig2 ] shows the result . the fact that this cross section is derived from a simple ( classical ) ansatz expressed by ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:13 ] ) raises doubts about its validity as a description of pion - nucleus scattering in the resonance region .",
    "an alternative approach to coherent pion nucleus interaction based on the glauber model was proposed by belkov and kopeliovich  @xcite .",
    "its numerical results were similar to those in the rs model at least at high energies .",
    "the experimental groups use detailed monte carlo routines to simulate the scattering and absorption of the pion inside the nucleus  @xcite . following the pcac route we have tried to circumvent the uncertainties in modelling nuclear processes by direct appeal to data on pion nucleus elastic scattering , see also  @xcite . for carbon targets",
    "this can be done easily because @xmath0 and @xmath74 data on differential and total cross sections exist for pion kinetic energies @xmath75 from 30 to 870 mev .",
    "they have been subjected to phase shift analyses yielding up to 21 complex phase shifts per energy  @xcite . neglecting electromagnetic effects",
    "these phase shifts can be used to compute the elastic strong interaction cross section @xmath76 for pion carbon scattering in a straightforward manner .    ) , the solid line is derived from pion carbon data as explained in the text . the table on the right hand side contains the coefficients @xmath77 of ( [ eq:16]).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the phase shifts accurately reproduce even tiny effects like secondary peaks in the angular distribution .",
    "we have checked that except for the lowest two kinetic energies of 30 and 50 mev it suffices to parametrize the cross section by the simple ansatz @xmath78 with energy dependent coefficients @xmath77 , which are listed in the table on the right hand side of fig.[fig2 ] . for energies between the measured",
    "data points these coefficients are linearly interpolated which is the reason for the zig - zag structure of the solid line in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath79 from pion carbon data is much below the rs model in the resonance region . at the same time",
    "one observes that as @xmath72 approaches 1 gev , the two curves become very similar with @xmath80 mb .",
    "this finally justifies the ansatz ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "it also suggests that the rs hadronic model fails in the region of the @xmath81 resonance , but may be a valid description at higher energies .",
    "we are now ready to integrate the cross section ( [ eq:6 ] ) for the two different models of pion carbon scattering discussed in the last section .",
    "the results are plotted versus the neutrino energy in fig.[fig3]a for @xmath82 production and in fig.[fig3]b for @xmath0 production . in obtaining the lower curves",
    "the empirical pion carbon cross sections were calculated by assuming the coefficients in the last line of the table on the right hand side of fig.[fig2 ] to be valid up to @xmath83 gev .",
    "an error of @xmath84 in this assumption results in a cross section error of @xmath85 at @xmath60 gev .",
    "the curve using carbon data is a factor of 3 to 2 below the curve obtained by applying the rs hadronic model .",
    "cross sections for nc and cc coherent single pion production on carbon have also been calculated using an ansatz based mainly on the microscopic process @xmath86 and its modification in the nuclear environment  @xcite .",
    "( for an early reference to this subject see  @xcite . )",
    "remarkably our calculations agree well with the corresponding results given in  @xcite based on a very different approach to coherent neutrino scattering .",
    "the predicted cross sections of  @xcite depend sensitively on a cut paarameter @xmath87 . referring to footnote 41 of  @xcite with @xmath88",
    "the results are close to the ones obtained in this paper .",
    "the differential cross sections @xmath89 or @xmath90 are more sensitive to details of the theoretical models . we give in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "our prediction for @xmath89 at a neutrino energy of 1 gev . for the cc reaction a pronounced dip in forward direction",
    "is seen which is mainly due to the adler screening factor contained in the rectangular brackets of ( [ eq:7 ] ) .    comparing to experimental results we first discuss @xmath0 production . at a neutrino energy of 1.3 gev",
    "the k2k experiment  @xcite has placed an upper limit of @xmath91 on the cross section ratio of coherent pion production @xmath92 to the total cc cross section @xmath93 at @xmath94 confidence level ( cl ) . using the k2k cut in the muon momentum ( @xmath95 gev ) our prediction is @xmath96 @xmath97 per nucleon . with @xmath98@xmath97",
    "as quoted in  @xcite we obtain @xmath99 which is consistent with the k2k result .",
    "the sciboone experiment  @xcite has measured an upper limit of @xmath100 at 1.1 gev ( @xmath94 cl ) on the same cross section ratio .",
    "assuming the @xmath93 value quoted in  @xcite to scale linearly with @xmath101 we obtain @xmath102 @xmath97/gev in the low energy regime and @xmath99 taking @xmath92 from fig.[fig3]b . at 2.2 gev",
    "the sciboone upper limit is @xmath103 to be compared with a calculated ratio of @xmath104 .",
    "the latter value requires a slight extrapolation of fig.[fig3]b .",
    "the improved model for coherent pion production is thus in good agreement with the @xmath0 measurements .",
    "it is possible that the lower cross section for coherent @xmath0 production also reduces the discrepancy at small @xmath18 in cc reactions noted by the miniboone collaboration  @xcite .",
    "turning to @xmath1 production the published coherent fraction @xmath105 of the miniboone experiment  @xcite is @xmath106 at a nominal neutrino energy of 1.2 gev . using the rein - sehgal model for incoherent production  @xcite and our present calculation of the coherent cross section we get a coherent fraction of @xmath107 which is much below the experimental findings .",
    "it would be interesting to see if there is a dependence of the experimental fraction on the details of the coherent model used in the analysis .",
    "it should be stressed that the theoretical prediction for coherent scattering covers only reactions where the nucleus stays intact and does not break up during interaction .",
    "the data on pion - carbon scattering  @xcite show that nearly two - thirds of the cross section is inelastic .",
    "our estimate of the error in the theoretical prediction ( taking account of the model dependence of @xmath108 , the extrapolation in @xmath18 , the interpolation in fig.[fig2 ] and the neglect of the transverse contributions @xmath109 estimated in  @xcite ) is @xmath110 .",
    "the total pion nucleus cross section scales @xmath111 at least for small atomic numbers @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "if the ratio of elastic to total cross section depends only weakly on @xmath38 we then expect the elastic cross section also to scale proportional to @xmath112 . using the rs hadronic model the ratio of the cross sections for aluminum ( @xmath113 ) and carbon is @xmath114 for @xmath60 gev corresponding to a scaling law @xmath115 . the algorithm presented in the preceding section",
    "can thus probably be simply extended to other light nuclei . applying the @xmath112 scaling law",
    "we obtain for aluminum @xmath116 @xmath97 at @xmath60 gev which agrees within errors with the experimental value of @xmath117 @xmath97 measured by the aachen padua experiment  @xcite .    for neutrino energies",
    "@xmath118 gev the calculation using carbon data is not applicable because a large part of the integration then needs carbon data for @xmath119 gev which are not available .",
    "the fact that the rs prediction for pion carbon scattering overlaps with the empirical result in the region @xmath120 gev ( fig.[fig2 ] ) may be a hint that the rs model begins to be a valid description of coherent pion production beyond the resonance region .",
    "such a view would explain the impressive agreement of the rs model with the large body of data on coherent pion production in the energy domain @xmath121 gev , as documented for example in  @xcite .",
