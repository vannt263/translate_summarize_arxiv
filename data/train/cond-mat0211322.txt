    "the stretched exponential relaxation ( ser ) , @xmath0 $ ] , describes the relaxation of pure glasses very accurately , often over very wide ranges @xcite .",
    "for example , ser describes equally well stress experiments on amorphous se , centered on @xmath1 s , as well as spin - polarized neutron scattering experiments , centered on @xmath2 s , both with the same value of @xmath3 , over a time range of more than @xmath4 .",
    "ser also describes accurately stress relaxation of the superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates , probably associated with the two - gap domain structure revealed by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite ; moreover , the measured value of @xmath3 is the predicted value , 3/5 , for ybco , by far the most extensively studied cuprate , with the highest quality samples .",
    "the agreement is such that it has been recently proposed that the ser be used as an independent measure of sample quality in these materials @xcite .",
    "phillips review @xcite gives many more examples and demonstrates the power of ser as a guide to understanding the dynamical properties of intrinsic glasses , especially network glasses .",
    "one of the most spectacular examples was the successful prediction @xcite of the long- and short - preparation - time values of @xmath3 of orthoterphenyl ( otp ) , as measured by multidimensional nmr .",
    "otp is the purest organic glass former available commercially ; the predicted values were 0.43 and 0.60 , and the observed values were 0.42 and 0.59 .",
    "it appears that ser may arise as a result of spatial inhomogeneities that are quenched into macroscopically pure , non - phase separated glasses on a microscopic scale as traps or sinks that appear as part of the glass - forming process .",
    "the existence of these inhomogeneities is difficult to detect experimentally , but they readily account for ser , and predict correctly the values of beta in many experiments @xcite .",
    "dynamical heterogeneities have been seen experimentally and numerically in glasses and supercooled liquids  @xcite , spin - glass models  @xcite , lennard - jones alloy mixtures with ellipsoidal probes @xcite as well as in coupled - chaotic systems such as diode - resonator arrays  @xcite . in particular , the concept of dynamical heterogeneities has emerged as critical for the description of the microscopic dynamics associated with the dramatic slowing down of the relaxation and diffusion processes as the temperature approaches @xmath5 , the glass - transition temperature @xcite .",
    "these spatial heterogeneities occur over time scales that are long with respect to the basic unit time of the systems  one step in coupled maps and a lattice vibration in supercooled liquids  but shorter than the macroscopic relaxation , where materials are known to be homogeneous .",
    "as the temperature or the driving force is decreased , these regions become more and more stable and might overtake the whole sample at a transition temperature .",
    "although the nature of spatial heterogeneities and their relation to the macroscopic dynamics remains incompletely understood , there is a considerable amount of work that relates directly to this issue .",
    "the mode - coupling theory describes the dynamics from the liquid phase into the supercooled regime and makes quantitative predictions that have been verified numerically in many systems  @xcite .",
    "it can not yet describe accurately the very long time behavior in the supercooled regime , however  @xcite .",
    "numerically , dynamical heterogeneities have been studied using a wide range of criteria tied various aspects of this feature@xcite .",
    "recently , however , some groups have focused on the renewal or mean first - passage time ( mfpt )  @xcite and the waiting - time distribution ( wtd ) which provide some link to the structure of the energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "although both the dynamical heterogeneities and the stretched exponential behavior are characteristics of many frustrated systems ( e.g. supercooled liquids @xcite ) , it is not clear what the relation between these two properties is . in this paper",
    ", we address this question and show that dynamical heterogeneities can be directly responsible for the observation of stretched exponential relaxation in coupled map lattices .",
    "we also show that these results are applicable to supercooled liquids and can provide a microscopic basis for the stretched exponential relaxation in these systems , in line with the observations of denny _ et al .",
    "_ on the long time dynamics of meta - basin hopping  @xcite",
    ".    recently , hunt _ et al .",
    "_ found that the distribution of the renewal time of a certain stochastic process measured in a one - dimensional lattice of coupled diode resonators could be fitted to a stretched exponential function over 6 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "simulations on a related model of diffusively coupled via short range interactions nonlinear maps show that the fit can be extended to more than 9 orders of magnitude , ruling out any other power law or simple combination of pure exponentials @xcite .",
    "the quality of the fit in this system is sufficient to distinguish the region of the parameter space where the dynamics is described by power - law distribution coupled with an exponential cut - off from the really stretched exponential distributions .",
    "@xcite contains background information important for understanding the results of the present work and will be referred to as [ i ] in the following . )",
    "these simulations [ i ] also demonstrated the importance of the system s size on its dynamics .",
    "while stretched exponentials are sufficiently robust and are observed even in some small samples , the quality of such fits is much poorer than in the big samples .",
    "this is in direct analogy with real experimental results and supports the observation that the quality of the samples is crucial for obtaining unambiguous stretched exponential behavior and meaningful values of the exponent @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "using simulations on this and other models , as well as some analytical results , we show here that ( 1 ) the stochastic process studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and [ i ] can be identified with a renewal process  @xcite , ( 2 ) a stretched exponential distribution of the renewal time implies a similar shape for the decay of the two - point auto - correlation function , and ( 3 ) renewal processes are present in a supercooled liquid and play a central role in its dynamics .",
    "granted the universal features of ser , readers unfamiliar with chaos theory and coupled maps may not see immediately the relevance of these mathematical tools to understanding the dynamical properties of supercooled liquids and glasses .",
    "even the successful predictions of the trap ( sink ) model @xcite appear to be unexpected .",
    "for instance , the survival probability of a random walker in the presence of randomly distributed static traps crosses over from exponential to ser only at longer times where very few ( @xmath6 for 10% traps ) of the walkers have survived @xcite . in our examples of steady - state dynamics in coupled maps , the analogous crossover in trap - time distributions @xmath7 occurs near @xmath8 to 10@xmath9 @xmath10 depending on the value of a control parameter .",
    "even the latter number is small compared to the crossovers observed , for example , for relaxation of the first peak in the structure factor in molecular dynamics simulations ( mds ) of crystallization - avoiding soft sphere mixtures @xcite , which occur near 3/4 of the maximum value .",
    "the reason for these differences is that the systems chosen for mds already represent prepared states with strong glass - forming tendencies .",
    "the random walker with random traps model contains spatial inhomogeneities , which we will show represent an essential feature necessary for ser , and which are absent from some popular models of static glass structure such as mode - coupling theory @xcite .",
    "that model does not contain the collapse of phase space that occurs as the liquid is supercooled to the glass transition , and that is why ser appears only at very long times",
    ". however , it does contain the correct dimensional dependence of diffusive behaviour that leads to the relation @xmath11 , which is important for comparisons to experiment . that the one - dimensional coupled map lattice discussed here reaches a steady - state much more rapidly than the random walker is a clear indication that this model is physically relevant .",
    "the way in which this happens was illustrated in fig",
    ". 8 of [ i ] : the surviving periodic domains are those that have avoided chaotic regions .",
    "we also emphasize that in this simple model , the behavior of the stretching exponent @xmath3 as a function of a control parameter @xmath12 is similar to the dependence of @xmath3 on the temperature in both 3d @xcite and 1d @xcite spin - glass models .",
