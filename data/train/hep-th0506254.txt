    "this suggests that any theory can be converted into a noncommutative one by replacing the ordinary function product with the @xmath47-product .      in order to build noncommutative yang - mills theories",

    "the noncommutative theory has the structure of a nonlocal theory . however , if we consider it as an effective theory , its energy scale gives us a cutoff and nonlocality is not a problem .",
    "further , as shown by kontsevich @xcite , at the level of the physical degrees of freedom there is a one to one relation between the commutative and the noncommutative theories .",

    "as previously mentioned , our purpose is the construction of a noncommutative version of the 6-dimensional @xmath7 gauge theory presented in section 2 .",
    "the fact that we are considering noncommutativity in 6d , means that we only need the seiberg - witten map for gauge fields .",

    "we are now in position to discuss some phenomenological implications of these new interactions .",
    "motivated by the fact that new physics effects would be more evident in those processes which are forbidden or strongly suppressed in the sm , we will consider the rare higgs boson decay into two photons , which is an one  loop prediction of the model and thus is naturally suppressed @xcite .",
    "due to its phenomenological importance , this decay has been the subject of permanent interest in the literature . apart from providing a good signature for the higgs boson search at hadron colliders with mass in the intermediate range @xmath155 @xcite ,",
    "the decay width of this process is also of great interest because it determines the cross section for higgs production in @xmath156 collisions @xcite . due to the fact that the @xmath157 coupling is generated by loop effects of charged particles ,",
    "its sensitivity to new heavy charged particles has been studied in many well motivated extensions of the sm , as the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , the left ",

    "@xcite .",
    "ratio as function of the higgs mass . ,",
    "width=288 ]    though the bound for @xmath10 was estimated for a value @xmath149 gev , for illustration purposes we will present results that contemplate larger values of the higgs mass . in fig.[fig ] , the variation of the normalized decay width @xmath172 is displayed as function of the higgs mass . from this figure",
    ", it can be appreciated that @xmath59 is sensitive to the sign of the @xmath10 parameter .",
    "a constructives or destructives effect corresponds to @xmath173 , which can increase or decrease the standard model prediction @xmath162 up to by @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively , for @xmath176 in the range @xmath177 gev .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with those obtained from other models . in general , theories beyond the sm",
    "require more complicated higgs sectors , _",
    "i.e. _ they incorporate new neutral and charged higgs bosons . however , in most cases , it is always possible to identify in an appropriate limit a sm  like higgs boson , that is a cp  even neutral scalar whose couplings to pairs of @xmath109 and @xmath110 bosons coincide with those given in the minimal sm .",
    "furthermore , new contributions coming from new charged scalar , fermion , and vector particles are expected .",
    "we briefly review the results for a sm  like higgs boson decaying into two photons , for the models mentioned previously . in the thdm ,",
    "the only new charged particle is the @xmath178 higgs boson , but its loop contribution to this decay is very small compared with the dominant @xmath109 contribution .",
    "thus , in this model , the @xmath156 decay width is essentially the same as for the sm @xcite . in the case of the mssm",
    ", this decay gets new contributions from superpartner loops .",
    "the @xmath156 width tends to be lower than the one of the sm due to cancelations between the @xmath109 loop and the supersymmetric chargino loops . in this case , if the charginos are heavy , the decay width can be quite near to the sm width @xcite .",
    "further , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the contribution of a new @xmath109 boson , like the one predicted by lrm , is quite suppressed , because the corresponding loop amplitude is related to the sm @xmath109 boson amplitude as @xmath179 .",
    "taking into account the existing @xmath180mass bounds @xcite , the @xmath156 width can be enhanced up to @xmath181 at best . as to the prediction of the littlest higgs model",
    "is concerned , in @xcite it was found that the @xmath156 width is reduced by @xmath182 compared to the sm value . from these results",
    ", we can see that the impact of noncommutative extra dimensions on the @xmath3 decay may be significantly more important than that predicted by some of the most popular sm extensions .",
    "in this work we explore the consequences of noncommutativity in a 6-dimensional model , by means of the seiberg - witten map .",
    "we consider the @xmath7 gauge higgs unification model of the electroweak interactions of @xcite and @xcite , compactified to 4d on an orbifold @xmath9 for @xmath14 .",
    "we analyze noncommutativity among all the 6-dimensional coordinates . as a consequence of the orbifold symmetries , it turns out that there are no corrections to the model due to noncommutativity among the 4d coordinates and the two - extra dimensions .",
    "we find that the corrections we obtain corresponding to noncommutativity among the 4d coordinates , differ from the ones of noncommutative models calculated directly in 4d , also by means of the seiberg - witten map @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "the corrections corresponding to noncommutativity of the extra dimensions have interesting phenomenological consequences , as we emphasize below .    as well as in the commutative model ,",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking should arise dynamically , from first order quantum corrections .",
    "this step can be done in the noncommutative theory , as far as the expected higgs mass is much less than the noncommutativity scale .",
    "thus it would be interesting to include matter and to study the corresponding noncommutative corrections , which could be done following @xcite , progress in this direction will be reported elsewhere .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the model we are considering here has a too high value for the weak angle .",
    "however , as noted in @xcite , there are various ways to solve this problem , in particular by an extension by a @xmath8 factor .",
    "furthermore , the noncommutative seiberg - witten map of the corresponding gauge field will not mix with the already present noncommutative corrections .",
    "thus we can expect that in a noncommutative version of this extended model , the kind of corrections presented here will still be present , in particular those corresponding to noncommutativity between extra dimensions . under this working assumption",
    ", we have studied the corrections due to noncommutativity of the extra dimensions by means of the effective lagrangian techniques .",
    "first , by the observation that these terms are quite sensitive to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 oblique parameters , we could obtain the bound to @xmath10 given by ( [ scale ] ) . in four dimensional noncommutative models , there are bounds obtained _ e.g. _ from low  energy tests of lorentz violation , which are extremely model dependent @xcite .",
    "we think that , in the framework of our working assumption , our bound has a less speculative nature , as it was obtained directly from the experimental constraints on the oblique parameters , without additional assumptions . with this bound established , we have looked at the impact of our corrections on the rare higgs decay into two photons .",
    "it turns out that the effect depends on the signature of the noncommutativity parameter , increasing or decreasing respectively the value of the sm decay width @xmath162 , with a net effect which could be significantly more important than that predicted by some of the most popular sm extensions @xcite .    finally , from the results of the particular noncommutative model we started with , which could be interesting on its own",
    ", we can conclude that noncommutativity in higher dimensional models can have interesting consequences and phenomenological effects beyond those of four dimensional noncommutative theories .",
    "the study of more realistic models , including matter fields , is in progress .",
