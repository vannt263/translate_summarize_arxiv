    "modern cosmological models suffer from a major theoretical difficulty , namely , the dark energy problem .",
    "the problem stems from the high - precision observational data with strong evidence that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion in recent times @xcite .",
    "many models have been constructed for an explanation of the late time acceleration of the universe , and those models can be mainly divided into two categories : dark energy models that change the matter content of the universe and modified gravity models that alter the einstein gravity .",
    "dark energy is generally modelled by the vacuum energy with an equation of state parameter @xmath3 or by a dynamical scalar field ( dubbed as quintessence ) with @xmath4 @xcite . even though both the cosmological constant and the quintessence field are observationally consistent in explaining the cosmic acceleration , the origin of these matter sources from fundamental physics is not well - understood @xcite .    on the other hand , late time acceleration",
    "can also be obtained from the modifications of general relativity , which introduces an extra degree of freedom to the gravitational sector itself .",

    ". one stringent constraint on these models is imposed from the avoidance of fifth force carried by the extra scalar degree of freedom @xcite , and a few successful models have been constructed @xcite .",
    "these models produce observationally consistent accelerating expansion preceded by the matter domination @xcite .    lately",
    ", the curvature singularity occurring at cosmological time scales have been found to be a serious problem in @xmath0 models @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 theories can be considered as equivalent scalar - tensor theories .",
    "it is easy to visualise curvature singularity in a @xmath0 theory by looking at the form of the potential appearing in its equivalent scalar - tensor theory in the jordan frame @xcite . due to the nonlinear motion of the scalar field",

    "the presence of the matter makes the occurrence of singularity more probable @xcite .",

    "we find that it is impossible to find a parameter space where both the fifth - force constraint and the curvature singularity issues are resolved .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : gendiscussion ] , we review the curvature singularity and fifth force constraints for a general function @xmath0 .",

    "[ sec : logmodel ] . finally , we summarise our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in @xmath0 theories of gravity , the einstein - hilbert action is modified by replacing the ricci scalar with an arbitrary function of @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 contains the matter degrees of freedom which does not include contributions from dark energy . for our convenience , we will write the arbitrary function in the following form @xmath9 , so that @xmath10 captures the modifications of einstein gravity .",
    "the effect of @xmath10 in the cosmological dynamics is relevant when local curvature becomes smaller than a characteristic infrared modification scale @xmath11 . above this scale ,",
    "the gravity behaves approximately as einstein gravity .    by varying the action with respect to the metric tensor @xmath12 one",
    "can obtain the field equation , and taking trace of that field equation we arrive at @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor coming from the matter lagrangian , and a comma with the subscript corresponds to the partial derivative with that quantity .",
    "the scalar - tensor representation of @xmath0 theory can be a found by identifying the term @xmath15 as a dynamical degree of freedom , and in literature , it is dubbed as the ` scalaron ' field @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the scalar curvature of the space - time is governed by the local value of the field @xmath17 .",
    "the above trace eq .   can be conveniently written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 it may not be always possible to invert the relation @xmath20 and obtain @xmath21 .",
    "therefore it is convenient to write @xmath22 in a parametric form @xmath23 here , the subscript @xmath24 denotes the potential in the jordan frame .",
    "the dynamics of the field @xmath17 is governed by its potential @xmath22 originating from the modified gravity , and a force term that is proportional to the stress - energy tensor @xmath14 . integrating this expression we can find @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we can effectively describe the dynamics of modified gravity by the dynamics of a scalar field whose value is uniquely determined by @xmath0 .",
    "the potential @xmath26 will have a global minimum at @xmath27 where cosmological evolution happens .",
    "but , as we will see , there is also a point in the field space , denoted by @xmath28 , where the curvature scalar @xmath5 diverges to infinity resulting into curvature singularity .",
    "typically , the points @xmath27 and @xmath28 would be separated by a finite field value with a finite energy barrier .",
    "therefore , the field can potentially reach to the singular point in the process of having small oscillations around its minimum , in particular when we consider objects with growing mass density @xcite .",
    "the minimum of the potential @xmath27 can be obtained by equating @xmath29 which corresponds to a constant curvature solution @xmath30 for the vacuum .",
    "thus , @xmath27 is also a de sitter point ; see eq ..    the appearance of the singularity can be seen both in the cosmological background @xcite , as well as in the astrophysical dense object going under spherical collapse @xcite .",
    "the eq . can also simply be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 @xmath34 incorporates the effects of matter .",
    "now , we would like to study the dynamics of the scalar field in an astrophysical system whose mass density increases with time , @xmath35 a collapsing object with time dependent @xmath34 . with the assumption of weak gravity ,",
    "the covariant derivative can be replaced by the usual flat space ones @xcite .",
    "again , in the approximation of isotropic matter distribution ( spherical collapse ) , spatial derivatives can be neglected @xcite .",
    "thus , if we consider objects whose mass density changes with time @xmath36 in a homogenous way , the above equation simplifies to @xmath37 this is an oscillator equation with a time dependent nonlinear potential .",
    "even if the initial oscillation amplitude is small , due to the nonlinear behaviour of the motion , the above mentioned singular point can be reached during the evolution of the field .",
    "as we will see , in many viable @xmath0 models when a collapsing astrophysical object is considered , @xmath17 evolves to the singular point in a finite time which is much shorter than the cosmological time scale @xmath38 sec .",
    "this makes the theory not viable .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that the @xmath0 gravity theory contains a scalar degree of freedom in addition to the usual graviton .",
    "the effect of the scalar degree of freedom in the matter sector is evident when the theory is rewritten in the einstein frame , where the gravity part is einstein hilbert type . taking the conformal transformation on the metric @xmath39 the action in transforms to @xmath40 } \\label{einsteinaction}\\ ] ] where , @xmath41 is the scalar field potential in the einstein frame @xmath42 all the quantities having tilde are defined in einstein frame .",
    "the mass of the scalar field @xmath43 can be as light as the present hubble constant , and as a result , there will appear a long range fifth force mediated by the field . in order to satisfy the local gravity constraints one must have some screening mechanism which can screen the fifth force on the surface of the sun / earth .",
    "one such mechanism is known as chameleon mechanism @xcite .",
    "the scalar field will be heavier in a dense object like earth , and light when the background density is less like the interstellar space .",
    "as long as the scalar field is heavy inside the surface of the earth , it will be frozen at the minimum of its effective potential @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the energy density of the matter field and can not contribute to the outside field .",
    "the only contribution to the outside field can be from a very thin shell around the surface of the earth .",
    "the thin shell parameter is given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are field values corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential inside and outside of a test body ( sun / earth ) .",
