    "the notion that dark matter ( dm ) may be related to the baryon asymmetry originates from a time almost as early as the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm itself @xcite . in these models",
    ", a mechanism sets the dm and baryon asymmetries such that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the dm and anti - dm number densities , and @xmath11 are the baryon and anti - baryon asymmetries . since the ratio of dm to baryon densities is observed to be @xmath12 , this suggests @xmath13 gev , where @xmath14 is the dm mass and @xmath15 is the proton mass .",
    "thus in these models , the natural mass scale for the dm is around 1 - 10 times the proton mass , significantly below the weak scale .",
    "the idea that the dm and baryon densities have a common mechanism setting their densities is a simple and compelling framework .",
    "the challenge for a model of dm that relates the dm and baryon asymmetries is , however , that it must satisfy the many requirements from our observations of the weak scale and below .",
    "many of the earliest models , especially those making use of electroweak sphalerons @xcite , had become highly constrained by these observations , particularly those from lep , making models of dm relating the dm and baryon asymmetries observationally less than compelling .",
    "employing ideas from hidden sector model building @xcite , the asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) paradigm @xcite showed how to evade these constraints by making use of higher dimension operators @xmath16 which carry no standard model ( sm ) gauge charge but carry @xmath0 .",
    "these operators are connected to the dm sector via higher dimension operators _ adm = , [ admops ] where @xmath16 has dimension @xmath17 and @xmath18 has dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the operators in eq .",
    "[ admops ] share a primordial matter - anti - matter asymmetry between the visible and dm sectors , realizing the relationship @xmath9 . for a review and list of references of dm models employing the higher dimension operators , see @xcite .",
    "adm can be embedded within supersymmetry ( susy ) , which stabilizes the adm particle via @xmath19-parity , and limits the types of operators in the superpotential . the simplest ( lowest dimension )",
    "superpotential operators for @xmath16 are the r - parity violating ( rpv ) operators w_b - l = h ,  u^c d^c d^c ,  q d^c ,  e^c , [ rpv ] where @xmath20 is a sm lepton doublet , @xmath21 the higgs doublet , @xmath22 right - handed anti - quarks , @xmath23 a right - handed charged anti - lepton , and @xmath24 is a quark doublet .",
    "the simplest form of superpotential operators for @xmath18 is @xmath2 , so that the simplest adm interactions take the form w_adm = x h ,  ,  ,  , [ basicadm ] where now we have explicitly included a flavor index @xmath25 on the generic scale of the operator @xmath26 .",
    "these interactions are centrally important for the collider phenomenology of adm - extended susy models . the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ basicadm ] ) induce decay of the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle ( losp ) to the dm particle , through the processes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman_xqld_decay ] .",
    "this implies that , in comparison to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the missing energy is reduced while the multiplicity of final state particles increases , so that experimental sensitivity to adm models can be very different in susy searches at the lhc .",
    "a number of theories , such as hidden valleys @xcite , mev dm @xcite , rpv @xcite and stealth susy @xcite , have already aimed to evade susy constraints by reducing the missing energy and increasing the number of final state particles .",
    "while adm models have similar structure in their collider signatures , they also have a potentially wider range of flavor signatures .    whether such signatures are realized at a collider depends on whether the losp is unstable to decay to the @xmath2 sector before the losp exits the detector .",
    "the lifetime of the losp is set by its nature ( _ e.g. _ squark , neutralino or slepton ) , by the supersymmetric spectrum , and , most importantly , by the scale @xmath26 of the operator . the scale @xmath26 can be strongly constrained by flavor physics , in a way similar to rpv .",
    "taken alone , without additional flavor structure , the rpv operators in eq .",
    "( [ rpv ] ) are known to have disastrous effects in , _",
    "e.g. _ , proton decay and neutron  anti - neutron ( @xmath27 ) oscillations @xcite .",
    "there are , however , several important differences between adm operators and rpv operators .",
    "first of all , with the presence of @xmath18 , @xmath19-parity is no longer violated , if the operator @xmath18 itself carries @xmath19-parity of -1 .",
    "this new r - parity stabilizes the lightest r - parity odd scalar , @xmath28 , of supermultiplet @xmath2 .",
    "second , dm now effectively carries baryon or lepton number , so that globally @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not violated .",
    "that forbids @xmath27 oscillations as well as proton decay ( when the @xmath2 fermion is heavier than the proton ) . for certain types of @xmath2 sectors ,",
    "the dm can induce proton decay , but it must be catalyzed by the dm , and for this to happen frequently enough to be observable , the scale @xmath26 must be quite low , around a tev @xcite .",
    "thus the worst of the usual constraints on rpv is lifted for adm .",
    "depending on the flavor structure of the model and the uv completion , however , the scales @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ basicadm ] ) are still constrained by meson oscillations , by flavor changing processes such as @xmath8 , and by various types of lepton flavor violation such as @xmath32 conversion and @xmath7 .    the flavor structure , and the corresponding constraints on the scale of the operator , thus has important implications for the collider signatures of adm .",
    "as we will see , for example , the lifetime of a pure bino neutralino at the lhc through the operator @xmath33 and an intermediate right - handed @xmath34-squark is roughly c~(200 ) ( ) ^2 ( ) ^4 ( ) ^7 , [ lifetime ] where @xmath35 is the mass of the intermediate squark and @xmath26 is the scale of the @xmath33 operator . depending on the constraints on @xmath26 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 may be collider stable though cosmologically unstable .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider constraints from a displaced secondary vertex search for generic adm models .",
    "previously , some lifetime estimates have been made using naive dimensional analysis  @xcite , but it is desirable to refine the displaced vertex analysis .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the flavor structure and constraints on adm and its implications for collider searches for susy .",
    "we compute the flavor constraints on the scale @xmath26 of the operator , relate these constraints to the lifetime of the losp , and derive constraints on the adm - extended mssm from standard susy searches . unlike many recent efforts to lift constraints on rpv operator coefficients through flavor structures @xcite",
    ", we will assume no flavor symmetry , but rather examine the range of possible signatures that could arise in a general flavor structure .",
    "note that the flavor constraints we place on dm in adm models will have applications to many models with flavorful dm @xcite , because the uv completion of the adm models we consider contain some of the same interactions .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : flavor ] , we carry out a thorough analysis of the flavor structure of all three adm models ( @xmath37 ) for the simplest uv completions ( except for the @xmath38 model which is essentially a model with a right - handed neutrino ) .",
    "we extract constraints on the general scale @xmath26 of the adm operator from various flavor processes .",
    "we highlight the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : flavor ] , and provide details of our flavor analysis in appendix a. next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : displaced ] , we examine the implications of the flavor constraints on @xmath26 for the losp lifetime at the lhc .",
    "we give details in appendix b of exact expressions for the lifetime of the losp through three and four body decays ( for which eq .  ( [ lifetime ] ) is only an approximate proxy ) .",
    "we show that prompt , displaced , and collider stable signatures are all possible consistent with flavor constraints , even in the absence of a flavor symmetry .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : lhc ] , we carry out a detailed analysis of the constraints on this model from existing searches assuming prompt losp decays .",
    "we compare the constraints in the standard susy searches against those for adm for 8 tev lhc analyses utilizing _",
    "( i ) _ 0 lepton plus 2 - 6 jets plus missing energy , and _",
    "( ii ) _ 1 - 2 leptons plus 3 - 6 jets plus missing energy .",
    "we thus lay firm groundwork for a more exhaustive analysis of susy adm signatures at the lhc in the future , before concluding in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we begin our study by discussing the uv completions for each higher dimension operator in eq .",
    "( [ basicadm ] ) , assessing the impact from flavor constraints on the scale @xmath26 of the operators in @xmath39 . as we will see in section [ sec : displaced ] , a careful computation of the lifetime of the losp shows that only when the scale of the operator in eq .",
    "( [ basicadm ] ) is @xmath40 will the decay of a neutralino losp be collider stable , or displaced , at the lhc ( though the details depend on the supersymmetric spectrum of the model ) .",
    "thus for phenomenological study of prompt decays at the lhc , we are mostly interested in flavor constraints that require @xmath41 tev , where @xmath26 is determined from a uv completion by @xmath42 , the mass of the mediator being integrated out to generate the operator , and @xmath43 , a product of couplings of that mediator to sm states and the dm . we summarize the results for constraints derived from meson oscillations , @xmath6 conversion , @xmath7 and @xmath8 including @xmath44 in this section , and refer the reader to appendix a for the details of our computations .",
    "@xmath45 mixing provides , in many cases ( except for the @xmath46 operator ) , the strongest constraint .",
    "we emphasize that we take a conservative approach without assuming a flavor structure , since there are many ways to relax flavor constraints by imposing a flavor structure on the model .",
    "for example , since both meson oscillations and lepton flavor constrain products of couplings to different generations , if the couplings to one of the generations is much larger than to the other generations the constraints will be considerably relaxed . in the case of meson oscillations",
    "the usefulness of this change is somewhat limited , however , since rotating from a flavor basis to the mass basis will induce couplings to the other generations which are generically not small unless the flavor and mass bases are closely aligned ( which would constitute a tuning in the absence of a flavor symmetry ) . in such cases , a flavor symmetry can alleviate these constraints .",
    "therefore , our results on flavor constraints and the corresponding discussion of displaced vertices from losp decay must be taken as conservative . even without the assumption of a flavor symmetry",
    ", we will find that prompt flavor violating decays of the losp are still possible at the lhc .",
    "in addition , deriving constraints in the absence of a flavor symmetry leaves open the interesting possibility for exotic flavor signatures at the lhc .",
    "we begin by analyzing the @xmath33 operator , assuming only one flavor of dm : w_adm = .",

    "the event generation that is required for the analyses we have carried out in this paper has a few technical challenges . as we see in figs .",
    "[ fig : collider_for_0lep_xudd_squarklsp ] and [ fig : collider_for_0lep_xudd_neutralinolsp ] , the cascade decay from the gluino and/or the squarks gives rise to a large number of outgoing particles at parton level , so that the phase space becomes very high - dimensional .",
    "in addition , the losp decays through a non - renormalizable interaction , and especially the neutralino losp leads to a 4-body decay through an intermediate off - shell squark or slepton .",
    "we also have exotic color vertices that involve color index contraction with the invariant tensor @xmath178 ( @xmath179 s are color indices ) in the case of the @xmath180 models .",
    "such technical challenges strongly restrict the choice of available tools . as of now ,",
    "non - renormalizable interactions and exotic color vertices can be treated successfully by using ` madgraph5 ` @xcite . however , ` madgraph5 ` generates events by a monte carlo integration of the matrix element over the full phase space , and with a higher multiplicity of final state particles , the integration often leads to unbearably slow performance and a big accumulation of error .",
    "this problem becomes worse if we have several on - shell particles in the process with narrow decay widths since more careful sampling near on - shell poles is needed for a given required accuracy , which will take more sampling iterations and will thus be more prone to numerical errors .",
    "therefore , it is much more desirable to generate events by splitting a process into a few subprocesses : production channels and decay modes , and to connect the subprocesses into a single big event by doing appropriate transformation .",
    "many monte carlo event generators indeed do the job in this way . for ` madgraph5 ` , an external tool called ` bridge ` is designed to address this issue @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we know , the ` bridge ` tool is restricted to 2-body or 3-body decays for each decay subprocess , and it is not clear whether the tool has been actively maintained with the recent rapid changes of ` madgraph5 ` .",
    "we address this difficulty by creating our own in - house tool called ` evchain ` @xcite : an event chaining tool that automatically orders ` madgraph5 ` event generation for each subprocess and combines resultant les houches event ( lhe ) format files @xcite into a single lhe format file by doing appropriate lorentz transformations and color flow number adjustments . although the current version is tightly incorporated with `",
    "madgraph5 ` , the general idea of ` evchain `",
    "is not restricted to ` madgraph5 ` since we treat each subprocess as a module with an interface of incoming and outgoing particles .",
    "insofar as incoming and outgoing particle types are matched , any event generator with any specific process can be used for generating each subprocess .",
    "we also note that we do not aim to provide an automatic decay width calculation , differently from ` bridge ` .",
    "the total decay width must be provided by ` madgraph5 ` or equivalent , while a relative branching ratio in one specific subprocess is automatically given by actual event generation . by this design choice , we simplified program requirements and we were able to generalize easily to any n - body decay processes . in the following ,",
    "we describe the tool in more detail .",
    "madgraph_process_map : : procspecmap madgraph_process_map = fromlist [ ( nothing , mgproc [ ] [ `` p p > go go qed=0 '' ] ) , ( just ( 3,1000021 , [ ] ) , mgproc [ ] [ `` go > n1 j j '' ] ) , ( just ( 4,1000021 , [ ] ) , mgproc [ ] [ `` go > n1 j j '' ] ) , ( just ( 1,1000022,[3 ] ) , mgproc [ `` define lep = e+ e- mu+ mu- ve ve   vm vm   '' , `` define sxx = sxxp sxxp   '' ] [ `` n1 > sxx lep j j '' ] ) , ( just ( 1,1000022,[4 ] ) , mgproc [ `` define lep = e+ e- mu+ mu- ve ve   vm vm   '' , `` define sxx = sxxp sxxp   '' ] [ `` n1 > sxx lep j j '' ] ) ]    ` evchain ` works as a `` meta - event - generator '' that supervises ` madgraph5 ` event generation for subprocesses . in fig . [",
    "fig : evchain_pipeline ] , we show the overall pipeline of ` evchain ` event generation .",
    "the tool is written in haskell  @xcite , which is buildable by using ` ghc 7.4 ` or higher  @xcite . `",
    "evchain ` currently exists in a library form , so a user makes a program executable linked with ` evchain ` .    in the source code of the user s program , the total event process is specified as a haskell tree data structure . the specification language as an embedded domain specific language ( edsl ) for ` evchain ` inside the haskell program is self - explanatory .",
    "we provide one example of such a specification description in fig .",
    "[ fig : evchain_specification ] , which is gluino pair - production of the @xmath80 model with neutralino losp as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evchain_specification ] .",
    "a total process is a production process module with two incoming particles and arbitrary number of outgoing particles",
    ". each outgoing particle can be either a terminal particle or a decay process , which is a module with one incoming particle and an arbitrary number of outgoing particles , where again an outgoing particle of a decay process is either a terminal particle or a decay process , recursively .",
    "an incoming / terminal particle is specified by a list of pdg codes , so that we can define a collection of particles as incoming or outgoing particles for convenience .",
    "each subprocess is mapped into ` madgraph5 ` processes .",
    "in the example , the total process is defined in ` total_process ` , which has ` decay_gluino ` , and ` decay_gluino ` is again defined by ` decay_neutralino ` . ` madgraph_process_map ` defines actual ` madgraph5 ` commands for each subprocess .",
    "when running , the program will first prepare ` madgraph5 ` directories for each subprocess . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evchain_pipeline ] , the on - shell particles ( denoted as @xmath181 in the figure ) that connect mother and daughter subprocesses can be multiple particles . `",
    "evchain ` automatically prepares for all of the cases as different working directories and avoids a name clash by making different hash numbers for distinct subprocesses and particles .",
    "since the same hash number is produced for the same process specification , the preparation step can be efficiently done only once for repeating event generations with different parameter sets . `",
    "evchain ` provides a configuration method for customizing the directory paths of relevant tools and working directories , which is adjustable for various cluster computing setups .",
    "after the preparation step , the event generation is done in two stages : ( i ) generating lhe event files for each subprocess in the order of subprocess dependency , ( ii ) combining lhe event files into a single lhe file to pass to the rest of the event generator ( event file sanitization , parton shower and hadronization using ` pythia ` , and detector simulation using ` pgs ` ) . `",
    "evchain ` facilitates an event counter and classifier . in every step after finishing each subprocess event generation , ` evchain ` counts the number of outgoing particles , and orders the next dependent subprocess event generation for only the required number as determined by the previous step .",
    "once all of the subprocess event generation is done , the combining routine runs through all events of the root subprocess , and recursively finds events in daughter subprocesses and chains them by adjusting particle numbers and color flow numbers and transforming particle momenta in the daughter process from the rest frame of decayed particle to the mother frame . after this ,",
    "the total number of events of the resultant lhe file are automatically matched with the number the user specifies , and the lhe file is fed into the rest of the pipeline .",
    "the ` evchain ` tool is designed to fit as a subsystem of ` pipeline ` , a cluster job coordinator for common high - energy physics tasks , described in appendix b. 3 in @xcite .",
    "we plan to improve the system with better support for general cluster facilities , at the same time as implementing missing functionality such as spin correlations .",
