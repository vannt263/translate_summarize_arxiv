    "scattering amplitudes in gauge theories are complicated quantities even in relatively simple cases such as planar @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory and despite the dramatic recent improvements in our understanding of the mathematical structure of this theory .",
    "some of this complication is unavoidable , since they depend non - trivially on many independent variables , and necessarily do so in terms of complicated functions : at weak coupling they can be expressed in terms of certain transcendental functions , and at strong coupling they compute minimal areas in anti - de sitter space with prescribed boundary conditions ( see ref .",
    "moreover at any coupling they apparently compute the expectation value of polygonal wilson loops with lightlike edges , when suitably defined ( see refs .",

    "the symbol encapsulates much of the physically relevant information about an amplitude while simultaneously trivializing all of the functional identities which render it nearly impossible to work with polylogarithm functions directly .",
    "in particular the application of symbol technology ( or `` symbology '' ) enabled the determination of a relatively simple `` one - line '' analytic formula for the two - loop 6-particle mhv amplitude in ref .",

    "let us note that that new techniques such as those developed in refs .",
    "@xcite seem to hold promise for generating much more data .    unlike the case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , none of these amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the classical polylogarithm functions only . despite this additional complexity",
    "it remains a very interesting open problem to find fully analytic formulas for these amplitudes in terms of generalized polylogarithms ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a possible algorithm towards this end ) .    given this complexity",
    "we are led to study various limits in which the answers simplify and then to hope that more general lessons can be extracted from them .",
    "one way to simplify the problem is to consider the special case when the 4-momentum of each particle ( or equivalently , all edges of the corresponding wilson loop ) lies in a common two - dimensional space .",

    "this requires an analytic continuation whose effect at the level of cross - ratios is to multiply each one by some phase .",
    "this analytic continuation reveals the contribution from the mandelstam cuts , which dominate over regge poles in the remainder function , and behave at @xmath10-loop order like @xmath11 , or @xmath12 when properly assembled into cross - ratios .",

    "the multi - regge behavior of amplitudes is of particular interest since it is expected ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) to be universal for all gauge theories , thereby providing an interesting opportunity for applying results from sym theory directly to qcd .",

    "the appropriate scaling of the momenta for @xmath53 is given by @xmath56 which means that the produced particles are strongly ordered in rapidity ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",

    "note that the @xmath82 s are projectively invariant , that is , for every non - vanishing @xmath83 , @xmath84 is equivalent to @xmath82 .",
    "we use this projective invariance to set the first non - vanishing component of each @xmath85 momentum to one .    in this manner",
    "we finally obtain the following momentum twistor parameterization of the multi - regge kinematics : @xmath86 in terms of @xmath87    armed with the @xmath85 we are able to compute , in terms of the @xmath88 s and @xmath89 s , the leading @xmath55 behavior of all quantities appearing in the symbols derived in ref .",

    "@xcite for planar amplitudes in direct channels ( when all energy invariants are positive ) the mandelstam cut contributions cancel in the multi - regge kinematics .",
    "however , in other regions ( mandelstam regions ) this does not happen , leading to the violation of a simple one - loop exponentiation ansatz suggested by the bds ansatz .",
    "the mandelstam regions are obtained by making some of the energy variables change their sign .",
    "for example for the @xmath92 particle amplitude one can consider the @xmath93 amplitude in a kinematic region analogous to the one shown in fig .",

    "but each of these can be uniquely expressed as a monomial in the @xmath105 .",

    "hence all we need to do is determine which of the @xmath105 develop a phase as particles 4 through @xmath114 are flipped .",

    "the invariant @xmath116 enters several different @xmath105 , each with various other @xmath76 s .",
    "however it is clear that only those invariants which span the @xmath39 produced particles ( or a subset of them ) change sign to positive , since the invariants which include the colliding particles @xmath117 do not change their energy components .",

    "interestingly , this is also the single @xmath105 which approaches @xmath120 most quickly in the multi - regge kinematics : from the results obtained in the previous section it can be shown that @xmath121 while all other cross - ratios that tend to unity do so no more quickly than @xmath122 .",
    "having concluded that only @xmath123 develops a phase in the mandelstam region of interest , the symbol of the imaginary part of the remainder function in this region is given simply by @xmath124 = -2 \\pi i\\ , u_{2\\,n{-}1}\\ ] ] in terms of the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomposition ] ) . as a practical matter",
    "we note that it is trivial to read off @xmath125 from the mathematica file accompanying ref .",
    "@xcite because the four - bracket @xmath44 serves as a unique signature for @xmath126 . by this",
    "we mean that @xmath44 appears only in the cross - ratio @xmath127 and not in any other @xmath105 . therefore in order to compute the coefficient @xmath125 in the symbol it is sufficient to discard all terms in the symbol which do not have @xmath44 in the first entry and simply strip off the leading @xmath44 from those that do .",
    "at this stage all that remains is to take the @xmath55 limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : symbol1 ] ) evaluated on the momentum twistor parameterization constructed in sec  [ sec : kinematics ] .",
    "such a limit may be safely taken at the level of the symbol by simply replacing each entry in the symbol by its leading order contribution at @xmath55 .      at @xmath10 loops we can only have a divergence like @xmath128 ,",
    "so it is expected that the two - loop amplitude @xmath38 should diverge only logarithmically @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a finite transcendentality two function .",
    "this expectation already demands two very non - trivial properties of @xmath125 in multi - regge kinematics .",
    "first of all it forbids from the symbol @xmath131 $ ] any terms of the form @xmath132 for any @xmath133 , as these would correspond to @xmath134 divergences for @xmath135 .",
    "secondly , the factorization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : limit1 ] ) as a product of @xmath136 times a finite function requires that all terms in the symbol @xmath125 with only a single @xmath54 must appear in the special form @xmath137 of a shuffle product of @xmath54 times some degree two symbol @xmath138 . after verifying the properties shown in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : limit1 ] ) .",

    "however , it is known that two - loop results for mhv scattering amplitudes and wilson loops , when expressed in terms of a basis of integrals , have a form which stabilizes at a low number of points .",
    "this fact makes it clear that the form of the remainder function , and any of its limits , should have a similar property .",
    "also , as discussed below , from knowledge of the symbol alone we can not exclude the possibility of an additive term proportional to @xmath143 in these formulas ; we omit such a term above because the direct bfkl calculation shows it to be absent  @xcite .    in order to facilitate comparison with a traditional bfkl calculation",
    "let us note that the large logarithm @xmath144 may be traded for mandelstam invariants via the relation @xmath145 which can be derived from the kinematics described in sec .",
    "[ sec : kinematics ] .",
    "notice that the two cross - ratios inside the logarithms in eq .   are related since they are obtained from the same four points : @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath114 .",
    "this makes it is possible to rewrite the answer in the extremely simple recursive form @xmath149 with @xmath150 and @xmath151 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : two ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath15 , @xmath152 here is the same as the @xmath27 used in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : firstw ] ) and  ( [ eq : two ] ) .    as will be explained in the parallel publication  @xcite ,",
    "the reason for this recursion is the fact that all produced particles are of the same helicity and the effective emission ( lipatov ) vertices are built in such a way that adding the emission of one additional particle cancels the adjacent ( purely transverse ) propagator .",
    "therefore at one and two loops the result can be easily obtained merely by redefining the transverse momenta of a bunch of the emitted particles that shrinks to a single emission point in the transverse space .",
    "let us now comment briefly on the symmetries of the answer .",
    "the remainder function has a dihedral symmetry acting on the particle labels .",
    "however , the multi - regge limit treats some particles specially so the whole dihedral group is broken to a single non - trivial generator which fixes the vertex @xmath153 . under the action of this generator",
    "the vertices are permuted as @xmath154 , @xmath155 , etc .",
    "this action can also be written more concisely as @xmath156 .    under the action of this symmetry generator",
    "the vertex @xmath157 gets mapped to @xmath158 so it would seem that the cross - ratios @xmath159 get transformed into something entirely different .",
    "however , we should remember that for our multi - regge kinematics @xmath160 . keeping this in mind",
    "we have that the remaining symmetry generator acts as @xmath161 .",
    "since @xmath162 , we obtain that the result in eq .",
    "is invariant .",
    "the lorentz group is also broken by the choice of kinematics .",
    "the lorentz transformations which preserve the multi - regge kinematics act in the transverse space as @xmath163 .",
    "we also have translation symmetry @xmath164 and dilatations @xmath165 .",
    "finally , there is a parity transformation @xmath166 .",
    "the inversion transformation acts on the transversal coordinates as @xmath167 , but it does not act in a simple way on the cross - ratios in transverse coordinates .    when @xmath168 or @xmath169 , the cross - ratios @xmath170 become infinite or vanish .",
    "however , we do nt expect any singularities to appear in these limits and , indeed , the answer we obtain has a smooth limit when @xmath168 or @xmath169 .",
    "the symbol only captures the leading functional transcendentality part of the answer , so it is important to ask if our result might be missing any `` beyond - the - symbol '' terms .",
    "since we have a function of transcendentality degree two , any missing additive contributions ought to be of the form @xmath171 or @xmath143 , multiplied by rational coefficients .    under the assumption that only the transverse cross - ratios can appear as arguments of the logarithms , it is easy to see that we will always get unwanted singularities when @xmath172 for some @xmath98 and @xmath173 .",
    "so we we can exclude terms of the form @xmath171 where the arguments of the logarithms are transverse space cross - ratios .",
    "however , this argument can not exclude the possibility of an additive constant proportional to @xmath143 .",
    "the two - loop @xmath1-point remainder function is parity even so it should be possible to express it in terms of familiar cross - ratios like @xmath105 which are parity even .",
    "however , the form obtained by caron - huot in ref .",
    "@xcite is written in terms of momentum twistors and it is not immediately clear how to convert it to a form containing only @xmath105-type cross - ratios . in this paper",
    "we have computed the multi - regge kinematics directly from the momentum twistors , without converting to mandelstam invariants @xmath174 first .",
    "we comment here on cross - ratios containing the most complicated type of composite four - brackets , @xmath175 .",
    "consider in particular the quantities @xmath176 where the bar means parity conjugate . recall that parity conjugation in momentum twistor space is defined by @xmath177 where the denominator involves the spinor helicity product @xmath178 .",
    "note that in our conventions we have @xmath179 then using @xmath180 and @xmath181 we get the following system of equations @xmath182 which determine the cross - ratios @xmath76 and @xmath183 explicitly in terms of the mandelstam invariants @xmath174 .",
    "of course , there is an ambiguity in solving this system of quadratic equations , but the remainder function should be independent on the choice of solution .",
    "it is easy to rewrite the above system in terms cross - ratios of type @xmath105 .",
    "needless to say , however , the resulting expressions for @xmath184 become very complicated .",
