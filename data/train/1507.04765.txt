    "in the last five years there has been a lot of activity around the study of the pentagram map , its generalizations and some related maps .",
    "the map was originally defined by richard schwartz over two decades ago ( @xcite ) and after a dormant period it came back with the publication of @xcite , where the authors proved that the map , when defined on _ twisted _ polygons , was completely integrable .",
    "the literature on the subject is quite sizable by now , as different authors proved that the original map on closed polygons was also completely integrable ( @xcite , @xcite ) ; worked on generalizations to polygons in higher dimensions and their integrability ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ; and studied the integrability of other related maps ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the subject has also branched into geometry and combinatorics , this bibliography refers only to some geometric generalizations of the map and is by no means exhaustive .",
    "the success of the map is perhaps due to its simplicity .",
    "the original map is defined on closed convex polygons in @xmath2 .",
    "the map takes a convex polygon in the projective plane to the one formed by the intersection of the lines that join every other vertex , as in the figure .",
    "the mathematical consequences of such a simple construction are astonishing ( in particular , the pentagram map is a double discretization of the boussinesq equation , a well - known completely integrable system modeling waves , see @xcite ) .",
    "integrability is studied not for the map itself , but for the map induced by it on the moduli space of planar projective polygons , that is on the space of equivalence classes of polygons up to a projective transformation . in @xcite",
    "the authors defined it on _ twisted _ polygons , or polygons with a monodromy after a period @xmath3 , and proved that the map induced on the moduli space is completely integrable .",
    "( the map is equivariant under projective transformations , thus the existence of the moduli induced map is guaranteed . )    in this paper we look at the generalization of the map from the grassmannian point of view .",
    "if we think of @xmath2 as the grassmaniann @xmath4 , that is , the space of homogeneous lines in @xmath5 , then the polygon would be a polygon in the grassmannian under the usual action of @xmath6 , with each side representing a homogeneous plane as in the picture .",
    "the case of @xmath7 was studied in @xcite where the authors proved that the generalized pentagram map was integrable for low dimensions , and conjectured that a scaling existed for the map that ensured the existence of a lax pair and its integrability .",
    "the conjecture was proved in @xcite .",
    "we can also consider this case as @xmath8 , @xmath9 . from this point of view , it is natural to investigate the generalized map defined on polygons in @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive integers , @xmath9 .",
    "in this paper we define and study the generalization of the pentagram map to twisted grassmannian polygons in @xmath0 , @xmath9 .",
    ".2 in        2ex    figure 1 : the pentagram map on pentagons in @xmath4    .2 in    the first step is to define the map on the moduli space of grassmannian twisted polygons , that is , on the space of equivalence classes of grassmannian twisted polygons , under the classical action of @xmath13 that generalizes the projective action of @xmath14 on @xmath7 .",
    "we do that by carefully studying the moduli space and finding generic coordinates that can be used to write the map in a convenient way ( as in the case of the original pentagram map , the map can only be defined generically ) .",
    "the coordinates are found with the use of a discrete moving frame constructed through a normalization process similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "the classification of invariants under this action is , as far as we know , unknown , and it is completed in section 3 .    in section 4",
    "we study the case @xmath15 . in a parallel fashion to the study in @xcite , we proceed to write the pentagram map on the moduli space in the chosen coordinates , and we show that it can be written as the solution of a linear system of equations .",
    "we use that description and cramer s rule to prove that the map is invariant under a certain scaling . as it was the case in @xcite , a critical part of",
    "the study is a fundamental lemma that decomposes the coefficient matrix of the system into terms that are homogeneous with respect to the scaling .",
    "this is lemma 4 for the even dimensional case , and lemma 9 for the odd dimensional one .",
    "the proofs of the rest of the results are supported by those two lemmas .",
    "once the invariance under scaling is proved , the construction of a lax representation is immediate when we introduce the scaling into a natural parameter - free lax representation that exists for any map induced on the moduli space by a map on polygons .    in section 5",
    "we prove the case @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the set of all @xmath18-dimensional subspaces of @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "each @xmath21 can be represented by a matrix @xmath22 of size @xmath23 such that the columns form a basis for @xmath24 .",
    "we denote this relation by @xmath25 .",
    "clearly @xmath26 for any @xmath27 , and the representation is not unique .",
    "hence , @xmath17 can be viewed as the space of equivalence classes of @xmath23 matrices , where two matrices are equivalent if their columns generate the same subspace .",
    "an element of this class , @xmath22 is called _ a lift of @xmath24_. the name reflects @xmath17 admitting the structure of a homogeneous space of dimension @xmath28 . indeed , consider the lie group @xmath29 , represented by block matrices of the form @xmath30 let @xmath31 be the subspace defined by @xmath32 . one can show that @xmath33 is isomorphic to @xmath17 and the natural action of @xmath34 on @xmath17 is given by @xmath35    consider @xmath0 for any positive integers @xmath36 , and let @xmath37 be the natural action of the group @xmath38 on @xmath0 .",

    "for any discrete closed @xmath3-polygon @xmath51 in @xmath52 ( i.e. satisfying @xmath53 ) , we have that @xmath54 is also a lift for the same polygon , with the same monodromy @xmath43 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath55 the moduli space of twisted @xmath3-gons in @xmath0 , that is , the space of equivalence classes of twisted polygons under the natural action of @xmath56 .",

    "in this section we will prove that the moduli space of regular twisted polygons , @xmath55 , is a @xmath66-dimensional manifold and will define local coordinates .",

    "all @xmath120 have the same jordan form _ , which we will call @xmath121 .    finally , notice that if @xmath122 , then @xmath123 let us choose @xmath124 to be the matrix that conjugates @xmath125 to its jordan normal form @xmath121 , so that @xmath120 will all be in jordan form .",
    "we can choose an order in the eigenvalues ( for example , from smallest to largest ) to ensure that the matrix is unique up to a factor that commutes with @xmath121 .",
    "it is known that if a matrix commutes with a jordan form matrix it must be block diagonal @xmath126 where each @xmath127 is a toepliz matrix , upper triangular , whenever the corresponding jordan block is of the form @xmath128 or it is diagonal if the jordan block is diagonal .",
    "thus , @xmath129 are unique up to a block - diagonal matrix of this form .",
    "since @xmath130 we have that @xmath131 @xmath132 for all @xmath50 . therefore , since @xmath133 commutes with the jordan normal form , it must be a toeplitz matrix of the form stated in the theorem , for all @xmath50 .",
    "finally , @xmath129 is unique up to a matrix commuting with @xmath121 , lets call it @xmath134 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the transformation of @xmath135 under the change of lifting , namely @xmath136 where @xmath137 ( @xmath129 found above ) , and @xmath138 toeplitz and commuting with @xmath121 .    how to determine which entries generate the others depend very much on the particular point in the grassmannian . in the generic case @xmath138 will all be diagonal ; we will next describe the process generically . using ( [ ab ] )",
    "we see that @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "before we describe the normalizations that will generate the syzygies , we recall that the determinants of @xmath134 are determined by ( [ norm1 ] ) for any @xmath85 , whenever @xmath3 and @xmath11 are coprime .",
    "let us call @xmath141 .",
    "the last round of normalizations will be chosen by equating those entries in place @xmath142 , @xmath143 with the entry @xmath144 .    if we denote by @xmath145 , and we denote the entries of @xmath146 by @xmath147 , then these normalizations result in equations of the form @xmath148 for @xmath149 , and @xmath150 equation ( [ dos ] ) solves for @xmath151 in terms of @xmath152 ( if @xmath153 is not positive , we would need to choose different normalizations ) , and substituting it in ( [ uno ] ) we get an expression for any @xmath154 in terms of @xmath152 . since @xmath155 , where @xmath129 was determined in the normalization of @xmath156 , @xmath152 is also determined .",
    "these last normalizations will produce as many syzygies in the entries in @xmath157 ( linear or quadratic ) as indicated in the statement of the theorem .",
    "the fact that the entries of @xmath77 , @xmath70 , generate all other invariants of polygons in @xmath0 is a consequence of the work in @xcite .",
    "it is very clear that these last normalizations could be chosen in many different ways ( we could make entries constant , for example ; or we could choose a different block , or relate entries from different blocks ) .",
    "not all choices will work for us , and in order to be able to prove scaling invariance of the map , it is important that we choose the equations to be homogeneous in the entries of @xmath158 .",
    "it is also simpler ( although not necessary ) if we choose entries from one block only to define the equations .",
    "the choice of @xmath157 versus @xmath158 , @xmath159 is just more convenient , but we could choose any other @xmath160 instead .",
