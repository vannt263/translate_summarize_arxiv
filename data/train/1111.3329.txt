    "high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in the iron pnictides , with a t@xmath3 as high as 55 k for the case of smfeaso@xmath7 and smfeasf@xmath1o@xmath0 @xcite , is one of the most perplexing discoveries of the decade in the field of condensed matter physics .",
    "the 122 series ( afe@xmath2as@xmath2 , a = ba , sr , ca , eu ) is of great interest since it is an oxygen - free htsc .",
    "superconductivity in the 122s can be induced by doping in any of the three atomic sites @xcite .",
    "the hole - doping achievable through chemical substitution with either k @xcite , na @xcite or cs @xcite in the atomic site @xmath8 can give a t@xmath3 as high as 39 k in the case of ba@xmath9k@xmath10fe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( spin - density wave ) and structural ( tetragonal to orthorhombic ) transitions that are near - coincident in the parent compounds @xcite are concomitantly and gradually suppressed upon doping .",
    "although in the electron - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 the two transitions separate with doping @xcite , it seems that there are examples pointing otherwise , as in the case of the isovalent ruthenium doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite and the case of electron - doped srfe@xmath11co@xmath12as@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the last is surprising if we consider the result on sn - flux grown ca(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 crystals @xcite for which the two transitions are clearly separated . in the case of potassium ( hole ) doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite the question of concomitant or separated transitions remains controversial . while powder neutron diffraction data argue for concomitant magnetic and structural transitions across the whole series @xcite , heat capacity on sn - flux grown ba@xmath13k@xmath14fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals shows two distinctive peaks attributed by the authors to the magnetic and structural phase transitions , respectively@xcite . in most cases the source of contradictory results appears to be connected to issues of sample quality .",
    "it has been pointed out that the proper flux to grow the 122s is feas @xcite , as other fluxes contaminate the sample with flux element inclusions , with a consequent impact on the physical properties .",
    "neutron diffraction on powder bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite determined a first - order structural and magnetic transition .",
    "complementary high resolution x - ray diffraction and heat capacity measurements on high quality bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 crystals revealed a 1@xmath15 order magnetic transition preceded by a structural transition that starts as a 2@xmath16 order transition at a slightly higher temperature but with a first order jump in the orthorhombic distortion coincident with the first order magnetic transition@xcite .",
    "for the electron - doped bafe@xmath11co@xmath12as@xmath2 it has been shown recently that the magnetic transition order changes upon doping from 1@xmath15 to 2@xmath16 through a tricritical point @xcite , which is believed to be relevant to the superconductivity phenomenon itself @xcite .",
    "for this series the structural transition is 2@xmath16 order .",

    "the afm transition is sharp ( width within 1 k ) , consistent with a weakly 1@xmath15 order transition , and the temparature dependence of the magnetic order parameter ( op ) squared is more gradual than that for the case of the parent bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "this possibly indicates proximity to a tricritical point . for the higher doping sample x=0.17",
    ", the transition presents a distribution of t@xmath6s due to a slight variation of the potassium dopant , leading to a rounding of the transition of about 6 k. this rounding makes it difficult to differentiate between first and second order behavior of the transition .",
    "our neutron data show that , although the sc under - doped x=0.17 sample has a sc volume fraction of @xmath440@xmath5 , the downturn in the afm order parameter below t@xmath3 and its enhancement in magnetic field provide possible evidence for microscopic coexistence of afm and sc , similar to the case of the electron - doped 122s@xcite .",

    "the downturn of the magnetic op is less pronounced than for the case of homologous superconducting electron doped bafe@xmath11co@xmath12as@xmath2 @xcite because of the low superconducting volume fraction .",
    "the `` rounded '' nel transition ( over a @xmath4 6 k temperature range ) is due in part to a slight distribution in the potassium doping , and therefore this will give an averaged @xmath35t@xmath6@xmath36 .",

    "the presence in the sample of small fractions of material with slightly smaller values of potassium doping will result in a non - zero magnetic order parameter above @xmath35t@xmath6@xmath36 and sc critical temperatures below @xmath35t@xmath3@xmath36 ( untraceable by means of resistivity and magnetization measurements ) .",

    "4 , right axis ) .",
    "the superconducting volume fraction is about 40@xmath5 .",
    "this value is considerably higher than the 23 @xmath5 reported for a higher potassium doped sn - flux grown sample @xcite , and contrasts with the 98@xmath5 value found by r. r. urbano @xmath17 @xcite in their sn - flux grown x=0.16 . in a magnetic field of 14 t ( fig .",
    "4 , left axis ) t@xmath3 decreases to @xmath48 k. this is expected since under - doped superconducting samples have a lower critical field h@xmath37 than those that are optimally doped , where the critical field was estimated to be above 75 t @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows elastic neutron - scattering scans of the ( 1 0 3 ) magnetic bragg peak at different temperatures : t=1.2 , 8 , 71 , and 92 k of the x=0.17 sample , in zero and 14.5 t. while for the 1.2 k the 14.5 t magnetic intensity is @xmath410@xmath5 higher than for the zero field , our data also show that a field of 14.5 t leaves the magnetic scattering practically unchanged within the errors for the ( t@xmath3 , t@xmath6 ) temperature range .",
    "this result certainly contrasts with the clear decrease of the magnetic intensity by @xmath410@xmath5 in 13.5 t reported on sn - flux grown higher potassium doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( with t@xmath3=32@xmath381 k ) of j. t. park @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "therefore our 14.5 t data on the hole k - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 is similar to the 10 t high resolution neutron data on the electron underdoped bafe@xmath39ni@xmath40as@xmath2 ( t@xmath3=17 k ) @xcite . here ,",
    "bellow t@xmath3 the intensity of the magnetic ( 1 1 3 ) peak is enhanced with @xmath410@xmath5 , while above t@xmath3 the intensity remains almost unchanged .",
    "one experiment to test the interplay between afm and sc would be to determine whether or not a high magnetic field induces afm in an optimally doped sample ( without any trace of static afm in zero field ) .",
    "this is very difficult to apply to the case of the optimally k - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 , as the critical field is over 75 t. since for the case of the electron - doped 122s the critical field is much lower , we performed zero and in - field ( 14 t ) resistivity measurements of optimally doped ni - doped srfe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "ni@xmath1as@xmath2 , x=0.155 normalized at its value at 320 k , in zero field and in 14 t//@xmath22 .",
    "before the measurement , the sample was annealed in low argon pressure for 24 hours at 700@xmath41 c. ]    figure 6 shows resistivity vs. temperature of the srfe@xmath23ni@xmath1as@xmath2 , with x=0.155 normalized at its value at 320 k value , in zero and in 14 t//@xmath22 ( it is known that for h//@xmath22 the critical field is lower than for h//(a b ) configuration @xcite ) . before measurement , the sample was annealed in low argon gas pressure for 24 hours at 700@xmath41 c @xcite .",
    "although t@xmath3 was suppressed from 10 to 5 k , there is no signature of any induced afm in the 14 t//@xmath22 data .",
    "it is important to mention that ni - doped samples with t@xmath3 of 5 k are well into the coexistence of sc and afm region on the phase diagram , therefore exhibiting robust afm .",
    "our high field resistivity data are in agreement therefore with neutron measurements in a 13.5 t//@xmath22 field on optimally electron - doped bafe@xmath42ni@xmath43as@xmath2 that showed that the field did not induce static afm order @xcite .",
    "therefore , part of the results of the hole- and electron - doped 122s seems to be consistent with a competing static afm order and sc , similar to that for cuprate htsc .",
    "the high field results reported here on the hole - doped ba@xmath44k@xmath45fe@xmath2as@xmath2 are similar to the case of cuprates for which the afm order is strengthened with application of a magnetic field @xcite . despite the resemblance of the shape of the phase diagrams @xcite for both iron pnictide and cuprate htsc",
    ", the superconductivity in these materials appears to be of a different nature .",
    "we believe that these results will stimulate further exploration .",
    "in summary , in the present article we report complementary elastic neutron scattering in zero and 14.5 t and magnetization measurements in zero and 14 t on under - doped sc x=0.17 , and zero field on non - sc x=0.09 .",
    "while for the non - sc x=0.09 sample the afm transition is sharp consistent with a weakly 1@xmath15 order transition , for higher doping x=0.17 the transition presents a broad distribution on t@xmath6 due to a slight variation of the k dopant . for sample",
    "x=0.09 the temperature dependence of the magnetic op is more gradual than for the case of parent bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 , indicative of proximity to a tricritical point .",
    "this tricritical point seems to be an universal feature among all superconducting 122s .",
    "the slight variation on the k dopant in the x=0.17 sc sample contributes to the fractional sc volume .",
    "although the sc under - doped x=0.17 sample has a sc volume fraction of @xmath440@xmath5 , we were able to observe a downturn in the afm order parameter below t@xmath3 , a clear sign of competition between afm and sc , and similar to the one observed in the electron - doped 122s .",
    "as for the case of electron - doped 122s , a 14.5 t magnetic field enhances the afm below t@xmath3 with @xmath410@xmath5 .",
    "this points , for the case at least of the 122s , toward a s@xmath46 sc pairing symmetry @xcite in the hole - doped material , similar to that in the electron - doped 122s .",
    "finally we mention that while writing the current paper , we became aware of related work by e. wiesenmayer @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "their combined x - ray and muon spin rotation on powder samples of the potassium under - doped materials show microscopical coexistence of afm and sc .",
