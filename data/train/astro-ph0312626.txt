    "= 9 mm    type ia supernovae ( sne ) are the most precise distance indicators for extragalactic astronomy at redshift @xmath13 . since the discovery that the absolute magnitudes at maximum light were related to the decline rates ( pskovskii 1977 , 1984 ; phillips 1993 ) , type ia sne have been considered standardizable candles .",
    "the intrinsically brighter ones have wider @xmath11- and @xmath14-band light curves , along with stronger and later secondary humps in the @xmath15-band light curves .",
    "the three principal schemes for characterizing the light curves are the @xmath9m@xmath10 method ( hamuy et al .",
    "1996 ; phillips et al . 1999 ) , the multicolor light curve shape ( mlcs ) method ( riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ; riess et al .",

    "6 , they presented the first @xmath5-band hubble diagram of type ia sne and commented , `` the dispersion in their absolute magnitude near maximum is small , making them potentially useful distance indicators . '' after this , with the exception of sn  1986 g ( frogel et al . 1987 ) , very few ir observations were made of type ia sne until the appearance of sn  1998bu ( jha et al .",

    "2000 ) .",
    "meikle ( 2000 ) gives a summary of the ir data available 4 years ago and states that `` most sne ia are _ standard _ ir candles at a level of about 0.15 mag . ''",
    "meikle s analysis related to the absolute magnitudes in @xmath0 at 14 days after t(@xmath12 ) and used host galaxy distance determinations via cepheids observed with hst . in this paper",
    "we use four of the same objects considered by meikle , namely sne  1980n , 1981b , 1986 g , and 1998bu .",
    "we key on their apparent and absolute magnitudes at _ maximum _ light .",
    "the majority of our objects are distant enough to be in the smooth hubble flow .",
    "it is well known that light is less extinguished by dust at infrared wavelengths compared to optical wavelengths .",
    "according to cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , a@xmath16/a@xmath17 = 0.282 , 0.190 , and 0.114 , for the near - ir @xmath0-bands . in principle , the near infrared bands should be less subject to systematic errors due to dust extinction along the line of sight . until recently it has been difficult to test this hypothesis because few type ia sne have been observed early enough to overlap the times of infrared maximum , which generally occur about 3 days prior to the @xmath11-band maximum .",
    "simple experimentation on the data showed us that the rest frame light curves could be fit by template @xmath0 light curves ( krisciunas et al .",
    "2004a ,  3.1 ) using the stretch technique of perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provided that the fits were made in the window of time @xmath312 to + 10 d with respect to t(@xmath12 ) . to create the near - ir templates ,",
    "the data were transformed to the sn rest frame by applying k - corrections to the observed magnitudes and time dilation corrections to the time from maximum light . since we did not have the perlmutter templates or the code to calculate the stretch factors directly , we estimated the optical stretch factors using the relationships of jha ( 2002 , fig .",
    "3.8 ) , which relate the @xmath11- and @xmath14-band stretch factors to the phillips parameter @xmath9m@xmath10(@xmath11 ) .",
    "we have very few ir light curves that are well sampled and cover the maxima .",
    "to bring all the data to a standard @xmath18 stretch , we used the inverse stretch factors @xmath19 ( averaging the @xmath11- and @xmath14-band values ) to scale the time axis of the ir light curves .",
    "the final templates , shown in fig . 1 , represent the averaged behavior in @xmath0 for a supernova with @xmath18 .",
    "our @xmath0 templates exhibit rms deviations of @xmath20 0.062 , @xmath21 0.080 , and @xmath22 0.075 mag around a cubic fit . except at @xmath23 + 7 d in the @xmath5-band diagram",
    ", these uncertainties seem to be _ bona fide _ measures of the rms errors , rather than evidence for systematic differences between objects .",
    "for @xmath24 the stretch method does not work beyond @xmath25 + 10 d because the secondary humps do not scale like the maxima .",
    "we then used the adopted maximum apparent magnitudes of eight of the nine template sne , estimates of the @xmath14-band extinction appropriate to each object , and the ratios of ir extinction to a@xmath17 of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) to obtain extinction - corrected maxima .",
    "for the seven objects with sparser data , we used the templates and appropriate extinction corrections to determine their extinction - corrected maxima .",

    "in other words : are there decline rate relations for the ir bands ? to answer this we derive the absolute magnitudes of the objects in our sample .",

    "[ absmags ] we show the @xmath0 absolute magnitudes of our sample .",
    "the uncertainties in the absolute magnitudes include the random errors of the photometry , template fitting , extinction corrections , and also the distance moduli .",

    "we also give the reduced @xmath41 values , which ( since they are close to 1 ) demonstrate that we have assumed sensible uncertainties for the adopted distance moduli and photometry , and that the absolute magnitudes are constant within the errors .",
    "[ jhk_hubble ] and [ absmags ] also demonstrate the soundness of the assumption that a single hubble constant is applicable out to a redshift of 0.04 .",

    "[ jhk_hubble ] , and the points corresponding to nearby objects and those in the hubble flow in fig .",
    "[ absmags ] would exhibit some kind of systematic difference .",
    "while type ia sne are _ standardizable _ candles in the optical bands , they apparently are _ standard _ candles in the near - ir , at the @xmath8 0.20 mag level or better ( @xmath8 9% in distance ) , depending on the filter .",
    "this confirms the prognostication of elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and the analysis of meikle ( 2000 ) , which had the benefit of cepheid - based distance determinations of the host galaxies of 8 objects .    in this paper",
    "we have outlined a new method of determining distances to type ia sne . of course , the use of highly non - standard @xmath0 filters is to be avoided .",
    "our method requires a minimum of one night s ir data in the window @xmath42 to + 10 d with respect to t(@xmath12 ) , and reasonably accurate values of t(@xmath12 ) and @xmath9m@xmath10(@xmath11 ) .",
    "this exploits the nature of the ir light curves , which are well behaved and obey the stretch model _ at maximum light_. by focusing on ir light curves we employ extinction corrections whose values and uncertainties are much smaller than in the optical .",
    "not only does this lead to very small scatter in the near - ir hubble diagrams , but it underscores the standard candle nature of type ia sne in the ir .",
