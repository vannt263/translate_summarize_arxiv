    "plasma heating in the iter burning regime will be provided mainly by an isotropic population of fusion - born alpha particles , with thermal energy significantly higher than that of the bulk plasma species  @xcite .",
    "these supra thermal particles must be kept confined in the core , in order to keep the plasma burning and prevent the vessel s walls from sustaining serious damages .",
    "however , they can drive alfvn eigenmodes ( aes ) unstable , which may then enhance their transport away from the core and direct them against the walls  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to predict alpha - particle losses and wall loads , one has to develop efficient techniques to assess the linear stability of all relevant modes for a given plasma equilibrium configuration .",
    "when modeling experimental results , measured data usually provide helpful guidance about which aes are interacting with the fast - particle population .",
    "present day diagnostics might provide the mode frequency , its radial location , and even its structure  @xcite , narrowing considerably the number of modes that need to be taken into account . however , no such guidance is available when dealing with scenarios for which no experiments have been performed yet .",
    "therefore , the number of modes that need to be taken into account , and have their interaction with the fast - particle population suitably evaluated , becomes quite large . in the following , a systematic approach is described to assess the linear stability of all aes that can be present in a prescribed iter - like equilibrium , within reasonable bounds for their frequencies and for their toroidal and poloidal mode numbers . because the number of modes to be handled is potentially quite large , care",
    "must be exercised when choosing the numerical tools to work with , which must be fast and computationally efficient .",
    "given a magnetic equilibrium configuration , its corresponding aes are first found with the ideal - mhd code mishka  @xcite , which is used to intensively scan a predefined range of normalized mode frequencies ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the tokamak s major axis , and @xmath3 is the on - axis alfvn velocity ) . for each toroidal mode number in the range @xmath4 , the frequency - scan procedure is as follows :",
    "first , the normalized - frequency interval is sampled with a constant step size @xmath5 ; then , each frequency sample is used to provide mishka with a starting guess for the mode s eigenvalue , while keeping a solution _ ansatz _ with @xmath6 poloidal harmonics ( @xmath7 ) ; if the ensuing eigenvalue problem does not converge in a few iterations ( in this case @xmath8 ) , the resulting solution is discarded and the next frequency sample is tried ; otherwise , the converged eigenmode is tested to find if its discretization over the radial grid in use ( @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 the poloidal - field flux , and @xmath12 its value at the boundary ) is adequate ; this procedure automatically excludes spurious , numerical - noise dominated solutions , as well as solutions with radial wavelengths shorter than that of the mesh size , and which can not be adequately represented in the grid ; in addition , solutions are also discarded if their frequency is found to match the alfvn continuum somewhere within the plasma , since in such circumstances they are expected to undergo strong damping .",
    "the frequency - scan phase ends up with a ( possibly large ) collection of aes whose interaction with the fusion - born alpha population needs to be evaluated .",
    "this task is carried out with the drift - kinetic code castor - k  @xcite , which computes the energy transfer between a mhd perturbation of a given magnetic equilibrium and a population of particles described by some equilibrium distribution function .",
    "for every ae in the collection , castor - k is run four times : first , to compute the drive due to fusion - born alpha particles described by a slowing - down energy distribution , and then once for each of the three thermal species ( dt - ion mixture , electrons , and helium ash ) .",
    "no radiative damping was considered in this analysis and the overall growth rate is taken to be the sum of all four contributions .",
    "the sizable computational effort involved in the proposed scheme is essentially due to the very large number of aes that need to be found by mishka and then processed by castor - k , and not to individual instances of either code .",
    "therefore , it falls into the category of trivially ( or `` embarrassingly '' ) parallel algorithms and a full parallelization of the proposed workflow was implemented in the helios supercomputer  @xcite , taking advantage of the independence of each ae processing .",
    "a typical workflow session in helios , which involves finding and processing a few thousand aes , takes about @xmath13 to @xmath14 hours if sufficient resources are available to allocate one ae to each computing node .",
    "the results presented and discussed below were obtained for the iter baseline scenario  @xcite , with total plasma current @xmath15 ma , low shear safety - factor in the core region and @xmath16 , peaked temperature profiles with @xmath17 kev for the dt ions and @xmath18 kev for the electrons , and flat density profiles ( almost up to the edge ) with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : astra.data ] ) .",

    "the frequency - scan procedure returns approximately @xmath24 distinct aes , which are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid.index ] .",
    "there , the dots mark the radial location of each mode s highest peak and the lines mark its radial width .",
    "the color denotes the grid index , which indicates the increasing difficulty of a uniform radial grid with @xmath25 points to describe modes with increasingly short - scale features .",

    "[ fig : grid.index ] agree , to a great extent , with analytical estimates of mode localization and width  @xcite .",
    "notable exceptions are the near - vertical structure at @xmath28 and the structures ending at @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 , which correspond to solutions outside the toroidal alfvn eigenmode ( tae ) frequency gap .",
    "another difference is the absence of modes in the left and right upper corners , which is caused by having the ae s _ ansatz _ limited to @xmath6 poloidal harmonics .",
    "other structures present in reference  @xcite are not displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid.index ] because the grid index of their aes exceeds the maximum value allowed . on the other hand , the absence of aes for low toroidal mode numbers [ @xmath32 for taes and @xmath33 for ellipticity alfvn eigenmodes ( eaes ) ] is due to the particular density profile : being flat almost up to the edge , the density profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : astra.data ] causes @xmath3 ( and hence the alfvn - continuum frequency @xmath34 ) to drop considerably in that region ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this effectively closes the outer end of the frequency gap and removes possible modes , located or extending into there , by continuum damping .    in the next step ,",
    "the linear stability of all aes in the collection is assessed with the castor - k code . for almost all aes ,",
    "the energy exchange is dominated by alpha particles or dt ions ( energetic particles from nbi or icrh were not considered ) , whereas electrons or helium ash have only negligible contributions .",
    "three frequency gaps are clearly visible in fig .",

    "the largest growth rates are limited to the range @xmath39 .",
    "again , there are no taes ( stable or not ) up to @xmath40 . however ,",
    "unstable eaes in the top branch start at @xmath41 , while all bottom - branch eaes are stable to alpha drive .",

    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : growthrate.n ] clearly shows that taes ( greenish symbols ) are the most unstable modes , with normalized growth rates in the range @xmath42 ( corresponding to @xmath43 ) .",
    "moreover , and in accordance with previous estimates  @xcite , the largest growth - rate value is attained at @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "top - branch eaes ( light orange ) and naes ( dark orange ) have their growth rate limited to more modest ranges , these being , respectively , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this being said , one should recall that radiative damping was not taken into account , which means that computed growth rates ( particularly for large @xmath27 ) may be overestimated .",
    "the representation of the aes localization and extension can bring more insight if it is supplemented with additional information . in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency.width ] , unstable aes are colored according to their normalized frequency , enabling one to easily identify which frequency ranges correspond to which radial structures . in particular , the near vertical structure at @xmath28 is seen to be made up of core - localized modes belonging to the top branch in the eaes gap .",
    "interestingly , it shows also that the same radial structure can be shared by different frequency gaps , as is the case of core - localized taes and naes . if unstable aes are colored by their growth rate instead , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : growthrate.width ] , it becomes readily obvious that the most unstable modes are short - width taes with @xmath47 and localized around @xmath48 .",
    "incidentally , one should recall from fig .",
    "[ fig : astra.data ] that the highest value of the alpha - pressure gradient takes place , precisely , at @xmath49 .",
    "the most unstable top - branch eaes are also short - width modes in the same toroidal mode number range , but localized deeper into the core , at @xmath50 .",
    "conversely , broad - width taes located at the outer half of the plasma ( @xmath51 ) are either close to marginal stability , stable , or interact with the alfvn continuum , being thus excluded from the plot .     unstable aes radial localization and width for each toroidal number @xmath27 , colored by their respective normalized frequency .",

    "a systematic approach to assess the linear stability of aes was presented that is particularly useful when dealing with scenarios for which no experimental guidance is available about which particular aes interact more intensely with the fast particle population . in summary , it starts with an intensive scan of a frequency and toroidal mode - number ranges to identify all possible ae candidates , it is followed by a filtering stage to exclude non - physical solutions , and it ends with all selected aes having their linear stability assessed by evaluating their energy exchange with the particle populations present in the plasma : fusion - born alphas , dt - ion mixture , electrons , and helium ash . a judicious choice of the codes employed , which are fast and effective to accomplish their intended goals , allowed the designed workflow to be efficiently parallelized in order to take advantage of massively parallel computer systems .",

    "were found to be either stable , close to marginal stability , or to interact with the alfvn continuum , short - width taes located around the maximum of the alpha - pressure gradient ( @xmath23 ) were found to be the most unstable ones in all the ae collection considered .",
