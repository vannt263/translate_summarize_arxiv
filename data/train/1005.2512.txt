    "the muskat problem was introduced into the mathematical literature by m. muskat @xcite as a model for the simultaneous flow of two immiscible fluids in a porous medium .",
    "the problem is of considerable practical relevance since it is also a model for the interaction between oil and water in an oil reservoir . in practice high flow water injection pumps",
    "fill the bottom of the reservoir with water to push the oil towards the wells like a piston .",
    "furthermore the injected water is used to keep the pressure in the reservoir unchanged over a long term , which is keeping the production rate constant . from the practical point of view",
    "it may be of interest to determine the optimal speed at which water drives the oil , which adheres more strongly to the porous structure , upwards to the oil well .",
    "in contrast to the mullins - sekerka problem , where the interface separating the two fluids is driven forward with normal velocity equal to the normal component of the velocity jump over the interface , cf .",
    "@xcite , the muskat problem considers a continuous velocity field in the whole domain occupied by the two fluids .",
    "the authors in @xcite show that the mullins - sekerka problem has a very natural parabolic structure and solve it by using the rich literature on this topic",
    ". a first result on the classical solvability of the muskat problem was obtain in @xcite , where local in time existence of classical solutions is established by using newton s iteration method .",
    "later on , in @xcite , the schauder fixed point theorem and existence results for a elliptic diffraction problem are used to prove existence of global solutions for small perturbations of some flat interface .",
    "the problem has been also considered by means of complex methods .",
    "we like to mention the work @xcite where global in time existence for initial data that are small perturbations of a flat interface are proved .",
    "the authors of @xcite also show that the problem is ill - posed when the less - viscous fluid drives forward the fluid with higher viscosity .",
    "further local well - posedness results have been established @xcite and more recently in @xcite by means of energy estimates in the absence of surface tension forces .    regarding the stability of equilibria an interesting result",
    "is found in @xcite where the stability of some circular steady - state is proven by considering series expansions and surface tension effects at the boundary between the fluids .",
    "the authors of @xcite state that the equilibrium is not generally asymptotically stable .",
    "as far as we know there are no other stability results for the muskat problem .",
    "both , the mullins - sekerka and the muskat problem are also closely related to fingering phenomena which have and still receive a lot of interest in many fields of sciences .    on the parabolicity of the muskat problem not many results are available .",
    "we show in this paper that the muskat problem and the mullins - sekerka model are related in the sense that the muskat problem is , at least in a neighbourhood of some flat interface , of parabolic type too .",
    "this observation is true , when considering surface tension effects , independently of the boundary data .",
    "when allowing only for gravity and viscosity effects we need to make restrictions to the boundary data which are consistent with earlier results mentioned above .",
    "the approach proposed here is not only a useful tool to prove the well - posedness of the problem but enables us also to use the theory on parabolic problems to establish the dependence of the solutions on the initial data ( see theorem [ t : main ] ) .",
    "furthermore , parabolic theory provides us a simple argument to prove exponential stability of some flat equilibrium , cf .",
    "theorem [ t : main2 ] .",
    "additionally , corollary [ c:1 ] yields an optimal value for the normal velocity at which water may displace oil in a oil reservoir .",
    "when considering surface tension effects , we find in theorem [ t : p3 ] for small values of the surface tension coefficient steady - state fingering solutions which are all unstable , cf .",
    "theorem [ t : instability ] . in the appendix",
    "we show that the problem under certain constant boundary conditions corresponds to a muskat problem in a frame moving with constant velocity .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we start with a short description of the model of interest and present the well - posedness result in section 2 . in order to establish this result",
    ", we transform in section 3 the problem on a fixed domain by straightening the unknown boundary and reduce the problem to an abstract evolution equation . in section [ s:6 ]",
    "we prove the asymptotic stability of some flat equilibrium which appears under certain constant boundary conditions . in the following section we find , using the surface tension coefficient as a bifurcation parameter , global bifurcation branches consisting only of unstable steady - state solutions of the problem . in the appendix we analyse the muskat problem in a moving frame .",
    "to give a precise description of the physical setting we are interested in , consider a porous medium ( or a vertical hele - shaw cell ) containing two incompressible and immiscible newtonian fluids in motion .",
    "we use the subscript @xmath0 when referring to the fluid located in the lower part of the porous medium and which occupies the domain @xmath1 respectively @xmath2 for the other one located in @xmath3 .",
    "these two fluid phases are separated by the interface @xmath4 which evolves in time and is to be determined as a part of the problem .",
    "the physically relevant problem is essentially three - dimensional , but it may be approximated by a two - dimensional mathematical model .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a deduction of a generalised darcy s law for non - newtonian fluids .",
    "the methods presented there apply also to newtonian fluids and yield for a fluid in motion in a hele - shaw cell the well - known linear darcy s law for a two - dimensional averaged problem .",

    "the interface at time @xmath34 is also prescribed : @xmath35    system is a two - phase moving boundary problem .",
    "the main interest is in determining the motion of the interface @xmath4 separating the fluids .",
    "if @xmath4 is known , then the potentials @xmath36 can be then found by solving elliptic mixed boundary value problems .",
    "we shall prove that if the boundary @xmath37 is the graph of a function which is small in some suitable banach space , then , locally in time , problem possesses a unique classical hlder solution . to that aim ,",

    "it is known that water is more dense than oil but oil is more viscous so that it adheres more strongly to the pores of the medium , cf .",

    "<S> we consider in this paper the muskat problem in a periodic geometry and incorporate capillary as well as gravity effects in the modelling . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is rewritten as an abstract evolution equation and we use this property to prove well - posedness of the problem and to establish exponential stability of some flat equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> using bifurcation theory we also find finger shaped steady - states which are all unstable . </S>"
