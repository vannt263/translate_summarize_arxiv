    "canvas has been used in oil painting starting from the end of 15th century in italy .",
    "a century later the use of canvas in painting spread to england , where canvases and stretchers were standardized and manufactured to be sold to artists  @xcite . in 19th century a new system of standards for canvas sizes was introduced in france ( the so - called second standardization after the first one in 17th century )  @xcite .",
    "this system has been accepted throughout europe and even imported to japan , where it remains the only one for canvas and strainer formats available from the local manufacturers of art materials . in the french standards the size increment goes discretely from size 0 ( called point 0 or toile de 0 ) to size 120 ( called point 120 or toile de 120 ) with 20 sizes for each of three formats , which are the figure ( f ) , landscape ( paysage , p ) and marine ( m ) ones , as shown in table [ frenchtable ] .",
    "the japanese standard sizes are identical to the french ones except some slight errors due to conversion and rounding up from the metric units to the japanese shaku units in the meiji era and the reverse conversion back to the metric units in 20th century ( 1 shaku @xmath0 10/33 m @xmath1 30.3 cm ) . beyond that , the japanese standards have also been extended to sizes 130 , 150 , 200 , 300 , and 500 .",
    ".french standard canvas sizes and their japanese extension for sizes 130  500 , which have been corrected for errors due to conversion between metric and shaku units .",
    "the heights for p130 and m130 , absent in the japanese extension , have also been added by using eq .",
    "( [ optimal]).[frenchtable ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      to these new heights .",
    "the lines connecting the symbols are drawn to guide the eye .",
    "the horizontal straight lines stand for @xmath2 ( red dashed ) , @xmath3 ( green dotted ) , and @xmath4 ( dash - dotted ) as in fig .",
    "[ ratiof ] .",
    "[ rgoldf],width=453 ]    when the new widths in tables [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] are assigned the points corresponding to the widths with a close length from the french standard sizes , the point 20 and 120 are left out as there are no similar lengths in the new widths .",
    "therefore , in tables [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] there are only 23 sizes corresponding to the french standard widths and their japanese extension , which are denoted as @xmath5 herewith .",
    "it is interesting to see how the ratios of the old widths @xmath5 to the new f , p and m heights at the same point sizes from tables [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] will deviate from the golden ratio and the porte dharmonie number . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ rgoldf ] , these deviations ( from the horizontal straight lines ) turn out to be much smaller compared to those of the french standard sizes and their japanese extension shown in fig .",
    "[ ratiof ] . from 23 sizes of each format ,",
    "12 ( that is 52% ) are very close to the corresponding horizontal straight lines .",
    "this shows that the new heights , obtained based on the new widths , are even more compatible with the old widths in the sense of approximating the golden ratio and porte dharmonie number .",
    "this is another sound evidence that the french standard canvas sizes and their japanese extension are not based on the symmetries such as golden and silver ratios as often claimed .",
    "in the present work a formula has been derived to calculate the widths ( longer lengths ) of canvases and stretchers , whose heights ( shorter lengths ) in three figure , landscape and marine formats satisfy the golden ratio and the porte dharmonie number as well as the rule for optimal use of material .    by using this formula the new standard canvas and stretcher sizes as well as their corresponding circumferences and areas",
    "have been calculated starting from the smallest width , which is equal to that of the french standards .    the exact fulfillment of the golden ratio and the porte dharmonie number is the main feature that makes the new standard canvas sizes distinctive from the existing french , european and american ones .",
    "at the same time , the rule for optimal use of material , which the new sizes also follow , allow them to be easily manufactured in mass production .    finally , the fact that the new heights are more compatible with the old widths from the french standard canvas sizes and their japanese extension with respect to the golden ratio and porte dharmonie number is another sound evidence that the old standard sizes are not based on these symmetries .",
