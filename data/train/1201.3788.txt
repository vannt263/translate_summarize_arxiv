    "our theoretical pictures match the experimental ones , where one can observe the formation of a central and various neighboring peaks , out of featureless mott state , which subsequently become sharper in the superfluid phase as a result of a phase coherence",
    ". it would be interesting to map out the nature of the bose transition in optical lattice systems by using further diagnostic tools such as bragg spectroscopy , which reveals the whole momentum structure of the single particle correlation function .",
    "a detailed understanding of this quantity is a challenging task in the further experimental studies of trapped ultra - cold gases .            in our calculations , we assume that the system is homogeneous , i.e. @xmath153 , with a lattice vector @xmath154 . since , the system is invariant under translations by integer multiples of lattice vectors ( homogeneous ) , @xmath98 depends only on @xmath5 , but not on the individual sites @xmath12 and @xmath13 ."

    "<S> lower tunneling rates lead to quicker decays of the correlations , which character becomes exponential . </S>",
    "<S> finally , correlation functions allow us to calculate quantities that are directly bound to experimental outcomes , namely time - of - flight absorption images and resulting visibility . </S>",
