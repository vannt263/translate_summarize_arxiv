    "globular clusters are now known to contain a population of neutron stars .",
    "there are 34 pulsars observed in globular clusters , 30 of them of the millisecond variety @xcite , and 12 low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite which probably contain neutron stars .",
    "the generally accepted scenario for neutron star formation and evolution gives their origin in type ii supernovae and for them to slowly spin down .",
    "the millisecond pulsars are thought to be the result of recycling by accretion of matter from binary companions . for globular clusters ,",
    "as well is in the galaxy at large , this picture has been the matter of some controversy .",
    "the presumed progenitors of the millisecond pulsars are the lmxbs , but some ( see for example bailyn & grindlay 1990 ) feel that this is inconsistent with the relative numbers of the two objects.rather than being spun - up neutron stars , the millisecond pulsars would , in this picture , come from the accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf pushed over the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "( see the review of bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 for a thorough discussion of these issues . )",
    "one of the key issues in this debate is the rate at which stellar interactions cause neutron stars to end up in binary systems leading to mass transfer and being spun up .",
    "an essential ingredient in estimating this is the total number of neutron stars present in the system .",
    "lyne & lorimer have recently reevaluated the distribution of space velocities of young field pulsars . based on their sample",
    "the mean birth , or `` kick '' , velocity of neutron stars is 450 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the typical escape velocity of a globular cluster is of order 20 km s@xmath0 , so if the globular cluster neutron stars are born with similar velocities , we would expect very few to remain in the clusters .",
    "verbunt & hut attempted to estimate a global retention fraction for globular cluster neutron stars .",
    "they assumed a typical escape velocity of 30 km s@xmath0 and used the lower kick velocity distribution of lyne , anderson , & salter .",
    "they estimated the retention fraction be @xmath1 .",
    "this treatment was updated by hut , murphy , & verbunt who used a collision - weighted average escape velocity of 47.7 km s@xmath0 and estimated the retention fraction to be 0.3 .",
    "these estimates are unsatisfactory since they are based on a single escape velocity and do not account properly for the variation in escape velocity within each cluster and between clusters .",
    "there is a need for a more realistic treatment of neutron star retention using dynamical models of globular clusters .",
    "this is all the more necessary in view of the increase in the mean kick velocity in lyne & lorimer .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide curves giving retention fractions as a function of kick velocity for a series of dynamical fokker - planck models .",
    "these are presented in the next section . as an example of their use , in ",
    "[ example ] i will calculate the overall retention rates for single stars assuming the lyne & lorimer velocity distribution , and the retention rates of binary fragments using the results of brandt & podsiadlowski .",
    "consider a star with velocity @xmath2 at a position in the cluster where the escape velocity is @xmath3 which receives a velocity kick @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that both velocities are isotropically distributed so that the angle @xmath5 between them is distributed as @xmath6 the resultant velocity , @xmath7 , is @xmath8 the star will remain bound to the cluster provided that @xmath9 , ie .",
    "so long as @xmath10 the probability that the star will be retained by the cluster is @xmath11 note that @xmath4 and @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ prob1 ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath3 , so let @xmath12 and @xmath13 and then @xmath14 if @xmath15 , then all stars with @xmath16 will escape from the cluster , while if @xmath17 , then all stars with @xmath18 are retained .",
    "all stars escape if @xmath19 .    in order to get the total retention probability as a function of @xmath4 for a given star system , we need the number of stars as a function both of position and velocity . for the purposes of this calculation",
    ", i assume a spherically symmetric cluster with an isotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "the distribution function is then a function of the energy alone .",
    "the density and potential can be derived from the distribution function , as can the velocity distribution at each radius .    in general , for a known distribution function , @xmath20 , the number of stars retained at radius @xmath21 as a function of @xmath22 is @xmath23 using eq.([prob2 ] ) , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the heaviside unit function . for a distribution function in energy @xmath26 , as is appropriate for the isotropic , spherically symmetric models to be discussed below , we can rewrite the number retained as @xmath27 .",
    "\\label{frac1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy has been normalized by the local escape velocity so @xmath28 , where the potential goes to zero at infinity .",
    "the limit on the integration is given by @xmath29 and is a function of radius since @xmath22 depends on the local escape velocity .",
    "equation ( [ frac1 ] ) can then be integrated over all radii and divided by the total number of stars to give the total fraction of stars retained as a function of @xmath4 , @xmath30 .",
    "the approach taken here was to evaluate the total fraction of stars retained using monte carlo techniques . to begin with",
    ", i consider the isotropic , single - mass , michie - king models @xcite . these form a single parameter family in terms of their degree of central concentration . the parameter is often given as the dimensionless central potential @xmath31 .",
    "for a series of models in this family , the density distribution and potential were calculated . for each test value of @xmath22 ( the models are dimensionless and the local escape velocity scales with the central escape velocity @xmath32 ) , stellar positions were drawn at random with a distribution consistent with the radial number density .",
    "for each position , the velocity distribution was computed from the lowered - maxwellian distribution function .",
    "the relative angle between the velocity vectors was chosen at random from the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ ptheta ] ) and the @xmath7 was computed .",
    "the retention fraction for the chosen @xmath22 is then the ratio of test stars with @xmath33 to the total number of test stars .",
    "sufficiently large samples were used to ensure numerical precision .",
    "figure  [ king ] shows the retention fractions as a function of @xmath34 , @xmath32 is the central escape velocity , for a range of michie - king models .",
    "the retention fractions are tabulated in table  [ kingtable ] note that the lower concentration models are most able to retain their neutron stars for a given @xmath34 since they have a greater number of stars within their cores . on the other hand , a low concentration model must have a much higher mass than a high concentration model to have the same central escape velocity .",
    "this scales as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the total mass of the system and @xmath21 is some scale radius .    in order to make more realistic estimates of the retention fractions ,",
    "i have done similar monte - carlo integrations of eq .",
    "( [ frac1 ] ) for a series of fokker - planck models .",
    "these models are as described in drukier with the differences discussed here .",
    "the models are based on direct numerical integration of the orbit - averaged form of the fokker - planck equation following the technique of cohn .",
    "a mass spectrum is included as are the effects of stellar evolution . since only the early time evolution of the models",
    "is required , the tidal stripping and binary heating as described in drukier have been turned off .",
    "stellar evolution has been handled by having each bin evolve over a time interval corresponding to the lifetimes of stars at the bin boundaries .",
    "since even the most massive stars take time to complete their evolution , the earliest stages of the evolution of the models are governed by two - body relaxation alone .",
    "dynamical friction can lead to a large degree of initial mass segregation when stellar mass - loss and neutron star formation commences .",
    "the treatment of stellar evolution has been modified from that described in drukier by adding an auxiliary mass species to hold the distribution function for the remnants as they evolve . at each time",
    "step an appropriate fraction of the progenitor distribution function is transferred to the remnants .",
    "the mean mass of the two bins still changes linearly over the time interval for evolution , but each of the two populations of stars , with their very different masses , are free to evolve separately . at the same time as the transfer is done at each time step , the transferred distribution function and its associated density profile are saved , together with the current potential .",
    "these are then used in the integration of eq .",
    "( [ frac1 ] ) at that time step .",
    "an appropriately weighted sum is computed to give the overall retention fraction for the model cluster .",
    "the mass range adopted for these models is from 32 to 0.1 .",
    "neutron star progenitors are assumed to have masses above 8 .",
    "it is likely that in population ii stars with masses as low as 5 will give rise to supernovae , but whether they leave a remnant or not is unknown @xcite .",
    "for such a large mass ratio , dynamical friction can be an important effect .",
    "i have used four logarithmically spaced bins for the neutron stars in these models .",
    "tests using only one or two bins gave substantially the same results , as did models with a lower mass limit of 0.15 .",
    "the models are assumed to start as michie - king models with @xmath37 , 5 , or 7 ; initial mass @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or @xmath41 ; and limiting radii @xmath42 between 15 and 65 pc with one model at 97 pc .",
    "the grid was not fully sampled .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed to take the form of a power - law @xmath43 with mass - spectral - index @xmath44 ; @xmath45 for the salpeter mass function .",
    "models with @xmath46 and @xmath47 were run . for @xmath48",
    "there are very few massive stars in the cluster to begin with .",
    "the initial parameters of the models run are listed in table  [ initial ] and table  [ initial2 ] sorted by initial half - mass relaxation time .",
    "the tables give the run identification number ; the model parameters @xmath31 , @xmath42 , @xmath44 , and @xmath36 ; the half - mass relaxation time @xcite ; and the number of neutron - star progenitors .",
    "only the models with relaxation times less than 20 gyr have been included .",
    "for the models listed in table  [ initial ] , the retention fractions as a function of @xmath4 are listed in table  [ retention ] .",
    "the table columns are arranged by model number , and give the retention fractions for a range of velocities . the corresponding velocity in km  s@xmath0 is the index number of the retention fraction multiplied by the number under the model number .",
    "i have listed the initial parameters of the models in table  [ initial2 ] for completeness .",
    "these models retain none of their neutron stars .",
    "their escape velocities are less than about 8 km  s@xmath0 so that all neutron stars born with velocities greater than about 15 km  s@xmath0 escape .    the effects on the retention fraction of varying the model parameters are shown in fig .",
    "[ models ] . at a given value of @xmath4",
    "the fraction retained increases with decreasing cluster size , increasing mass and increasing concentration .",
    "models with smaller sizes , larger masses , or higher concentrations have larger escape velocities and can thus retain a higher fraction of stars at a given velocity . the variation with @xmath42 and @xmath36 are comparable , but @xmath36 has a much larger range in globular clusters .",
    "the variation with concentration is much the same as for the michie - king models in figure  [ king ] when proper attention is paid to the scaling .",
    "for all values of @xmath4 , the models with @xmath47 have a higher @xmath49 than the corresponding models with @xmath46 .",
    "since the @xmath47 models have fewer massive stars than the @xmath46 models , they lose less mass during the supernovae .",
    "hence , the mean escape velocity over the period of massive star evolution is higher for the @xmath47 models and more neutron stars are retained .",
    "the difference with @xmath44 is fairly small and the additional retention fraction is tightly connected with a lower number of neutron - star progenitors .",
    "the net result is that the total number of neutron stars in an @xmath47 cluster will be lower than in an @xmath46 cluster .",
    "although it is not obvious from figure  [ models ] , apart from a velocity scale factor the retention curves for each @xmath44 and @xmath31 are very similar .",
    "further , they are quite similar to curves for the appropriate @xmath31 in figure  [ king ] . to test this ,",
    "i have compared the retention fraction curves with the curves for the appropriate michie - king models .",
    "i have fit a scale velocity between the two curves and then computed the absolute maximum difference in @xmath49 . for @xmath46",
    "the maximum difference is 0.03 for model 1 and for @xmath47 the maximum difference is 0.05 for model 3 .",
    "the size of the maximum difference generally decreases with increasing @xmath50 , but the relationship is a complicated combination of the structural parameters @xmath31 , @xmath42 , and @xmath36 .    on the other hand , we can estimate the scaling velocity from the parameters as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the fraction of the total mass remaining after the end of neutron star formation and is 0.776 for @xmath46 and 0.991 for @xmath47 .",
    "values for @xmath53 are given in table  [ ve ] for @xmath36 in  and @xmath42 in pc .",
    "( the king concentration parameter @xmath54 has also been listed for those unfamiliar with @xmath31 . )",
    "this value of the scale velocity is within a few percent of the best fit estimate , but decreases with respect to the best fit value as the relaxation time decreases .",
    "another way to look at this is that for short relaxation times , retention fractions calculated using the parameter estimate of the scale velocity and the michie - king retention curves are systematically smaller than the retention fractions from the fokker - planck models themselves .",
    "this can be attributed to dynamical friction which enhances the number of neutron - star progenitors in regions with large escape velocities .",
    "the limited amount of two - body relaxation which takes place before stellar evolution mass loss begins also enhances the central potential and the neutron star retention rate .",
    "there is a small difference in the shape of the curves for @xmath47 and @xmath55 for short relaxation times .",
    "this is clearly due to mass segregation from dynamical friction .",
    "this limits the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "the maximum absolute difference in the retention fractions are 0.12 for @xmath47 and @xmath56 for @xmath46 .",
    "bearing in mind these systematic differences , we can approximate a retention fraction curve for models unlike those given in table  [ initial ] by using the appropriately scaled retention curves from table  [ kingtable ] .",
    "the effect of this approximation on the final retention rates will depend on the kick velocity distribution employed .",
    "a feeling for the size of the uncertainty can be taken from comparisons of rates based on table  [ retention ] curves with rates based on scaled table  [ kingtable ] curves .",
    "once @xmath30 is available , we can calculate the retention fraction of neutron stars in a given model by assuming a distribution of kick velocities . here , i use the distribution estimated by lyne & lorimer for the population i pulsars .",
    "note that the correct value of the parameter @xmath57 is 0.3 , not 0.13 as published ( d. lorimer , private communication ) .",
    "the results for a range of models are listed in the column labelled @xmath58 in table  [ final ] . for the most part ,",
    "less than 1% of the neutron stars are retained by the models .",
    "only models with initial masses of @xmath59 retain more than 3% of their initial neutron stars . in no case",
    "does a model retain more than 10% .",
    "i have also tried models with a larger range of neutron star progenitors .",
    "this only changes the retention fractions by 10% or so , but such a model would have a larger number of neutron stars to retain .",
    "the number of neutron stars retained for each model , under the assumption that all the progenitors were single stars , is listed in the column labelled @xmath60 in table  [ final ] .",
    "only models with @xmath46 , @xmath61 and either highly concentrated ( high @xmath31 ) or compact ( small @xmath42 ) retain more than 1000 neutron stars in this scenario . for less massive models ,",
    "the maximum number of retained neutron stars is of order 100 for @xmath46 and of order 10 for @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , under these assumptions , very few neutron stars would be retained in most globular clusters .    until now",
    ", i have assumed that the neutron star progenitors are single stars .",
    "most massive stars , however , are members of multiple star systems , and the effects of multiplicity on the neutron star retention rates must be included .",
    "there are three possible outcomes when the primary star in the binary becomes a supernova and receives its kick .",
    "the system may become unbound , the system may remain bound with a change in its center - of - mass velocity , or the neutron star may pass close to the companion , or even hit it in the extreme case , triggering mass transfer and probable merger , forming a thorne - ytkow object .",
    "brandt and podsiadlowski used the same lyne & lorimer velocity spectrum to calculate the relative proportions of each outcome and the velocity distribution of the resulting binaries .",
    "i have used the results for the high - mass x - ray binaries from section 3.2 of brandt and podsiadlowski .",
    "this work was meant as an exploratory investigation , so they used only one set of initial masses , but a distribution of initial periods .",
    "the calculations were based on a set of plausible , but arbitrary assumptions with regard to mass transfer in the evolving binary . as in brandt and podsiadlowski ,",
    "the estimates given here are intended as suggestive rather than definitive .",
    "although not explicitly given in brandt and podsiadlowski , the same calculation can also give the resulting velocities for each of the components of a disrupted system and for the merged remnant of the to .",
    "the velocity distributions for the four types of results , assuming the lyne & lorimer kick distribution , are show in figure  [ binaries ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the distribution of speeds for the low velocity products : the former companion in the unbound systems , the centre - of - mass motion of the bound binaries , and the motion of the merged objects .",
    "the bi - modal distribution of speeds for the unbound companion is a result of the two possible masses of the star under the two different regimes of stable or dynamical mass transfer ( see brandt and podsiadlowski 1995 for details ) .",
    "the velocity distribution for the new - born , unbound neutron stars is given in the lower panel .",
    "it has the same peak as the lyne & lorimer velocities , but a longer high - velocity tail . in passing",
    ", this may suggest that the high - velocity pulsars in the lyne & lorimer sample may have their origin in binaries and that the true kick - velocity distribution truncates at lower velocities .",
    "if this were the case , the neutron star retention fraction would be somewhat increased , but since the mode of the distributions remains at around 250 km s@xmath62 , it would not be a large effect .    for each channel of evolution , we can calculate the overall probability of retention using the curves as from table  [ retention ] . for a disrupted system",
    ", the overall retention fraction is calculated using the velocity distributions for the freed neutron star and its former companion .",
    "the companion , if retained by the cluster , is assumed , by two - body interactions , to rejoin the general background distribution of velocities .",
    "( dynamical friction is a quick process . )",
    "its retention probability in its subsequent supernova is given by the single star retention rate .",
    "the retention fraction of stars in the to channel is also calculated using their distribution of resultant velocities .    for the systems which remain bound ,",
    "the distribution of changes in center - of - mass velocity based on brandt and podsiadlowski is used for the distribution of kick velocities .",
    "the subsequent evolution of these systems is highly dependent on their new orbital parameters and the environment , but somewhere between 0 and 2 neutron stars remain bound to the cluster from each system . systems with sufficiently short periods are expected to become high - mass x - ray binaries and experience a spiral - in phase resulting in the formation of a to . the envelope will then be ejected leaving a single neutron star bound to the cluster , no second supernova having occured .",
    "systems with longer periods will probably suffer a common - envelope phase and leave a short - period binary consisting of a helium star and a neutron star .",
    "such systems would have a second supernova @xcite .",
    "the critical period is somewhere around 100 days @xcite and the majority of the systems in brandt & podsiadlowski had periods less than 100 days .",
    "on the other hand , their figure  8b shows that there is a correlation between centre - of - mass velocity and period in the sense that the longer period systems had lower centre - of - mass velocities and thus were more likely to be bound to the cluster .",
    "overall , it is plausible that each initial binary results in a single neutron star remaining in the cluster .    given the fractions from each channel , the total fraction of neutron stars originating in binaries which are retained by the cluster is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fraction of systems which remain bound , @xmath65 is the fraction of the bound systems becoming tos ( the fraction of unbound systems which suffer close encounters as the neutron star escapes is very small ) , and the factors subscripted @xmath21 are the retention fractions for the various populations : @xmath66 for the unbound neutron stars , @xmath67 for their former companions , @xmath68 for the single neutron stars as above , @xmath69 for the tos , and @xmath70 for the systems which remain bound .",
    "the factor @xmath71 deals with the fate of the binary systems .",
    "its value lies between 0 and 2 , but is likely to be 1 as discussed above . for the models listed in table  [ initial ] , i list in table  [ final ] the retention fractions for the various processes .",
    "i have taken @xmath72 and @xmath73 based on brandt & podsiadlowski , but it should be noted that these came from a particular set of assumptions and initial conditions and should be considered as approximate .",
    "the first column gives the model number as in table  [ initial ] , the next five columns give fraction of neutron stars retained through each individual channel listed above .",
    "the next two columns give the combined fraction retained from the binary systems using eq.([combine ] ) and assuming that @xmath74 or 2 .",
    "the next column gives the number of neutron stars retained if they are all single stars and the final three columns give the expected number of retained neutron stars under the assumption that all the neutron star progenitors are in binary systems , but that either the bound binaries leave no neutron stars in the cluster ( the @xmath74 case ) , @xmath75 , that they leave one neutron star ( the @xmath76 case ) , @xmath77 , or that they leave two neutron stars in the cluster ( the @xmath78 case ) , @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath76 case gives the most likely value .    by comparing the @xmath68 column and the two @xmath80 columns ,",
    "it is clear that neutron stars originating from binaries are more likely to be retained than neutron stars from single stars .",
    "further , the major mechanism for retaining neutron stars is through the channel of binaries which remain bound and binary after the first supernova .",
    "if the fate of these systems is as discussed above , then these binaries will ultimately leave one neutron star without any further violent events to eject it from the cluster .",
    "thus , on the assumptions made here , most globular cluster neutron stars will have passed through a high - mass x - ray binary phase .    between clusters , it is also clear from table  [ final ] that the shape of the initial mass function will play a crucial role in determining the number of neutron stars in the cluster .",
    "the variation in the retention fractions with the mass function slope is relatively small , so of two clusters with the same structural parameters  initial mass , size , and concentration  the cluster with the larger number of massive stars will retain the larger number of neutron stars .",
    "this holds even if this cluster is somewhat less massive , less concentrated , or larger than the other cluster with the steeper initial mass function .    to illustrate this point further , and as an example of the use of the michie - king model approximation",
    ", i estimate the number of retained neutron stars for two globular clusters .",
    "the main problem in making such estimates for particular globular clusters is that the initial conditions of the cluster are required , not the present state .",
    "since the initial conditions are unknown , this presents a problem , but estimates can be made .",
    "i will consider two globular clusters : ngc 6397 and @xmath81 cen .",
    "for ngc  6397 , approximate initial conditions are known from the modelling in drukier .",
    "the model used is model u30-b . since the cluster had a fairly low initial mass , it is to be expected that it lost a large majority of its neutron stars .",
    "drukier showed that some neutron stars had to have been retained , so i have taken the model with the largest initial number of massive stars .",
    "the @xmath81 cen model assumes that the cluster hasnt evolved very much , which is reasonable enough given its high mass and low concentration , but does include the appropriate change in the total mass .",
    "the parameters i adopt for the initial models are listed in table  [ 3 clusters ] .",
    "table  [ 3 clusters ] also contains the estimates of the original and retained numbers of neutron stars under the same assumptions as in table  [ final ] , except that for the number originating from binaries , @xmath76 is assumed .",
    "ngc  6397 s lower initial mass is balanced by its higher concentration , smaller size and larger number of neutron - star progenitors .",
    "@xmath81 cen retains a much higher fraction of its neutron stars , but the two clusters end up retaining under the various scenarios the same numbers of neutron stars .",
    "i have presented tables based on fokker - planck models which give the retention fractions of neutron stars as a function of the initial parameters of the models and of the neutron star kick velocity .",
    "i have also introduced an approximation technique using michie - king models .",
    "these can be combined with a distribution of kick velocities to estimate the number of neutron stars retained by a globular cluster .",
    "one difficulty with this approach , is that the present structure of a globular cluster is not necessarily a good estimate of the state of the cluster when the neutron stars were formed .",
    "these retention fractions have been integrated over the kick velocity distribution of lyne & lorimer , and , as expected , very few single neutron stars are retained .",
    "the same distribution has been applied to the evolution of a model sample of high - mass binaries and the fraction of neutron stars retained from binaries was similarly estimated .",
    "based on these estimates , the dominant source of globular cluster neutron stars would be via high - mass x - ray binaries . both for neutron stars originating as single stars and in binaries ,",
    "the number retained is strongly dependent on the number of neutron - star progenitors . increasing the number of progenitors increases the total mass loss and reduces the fraction retained , but the larger number of stars more than makes up for this reductions .",
    "the retention fractions given in this paper contribute only to the first stage in estimating the observed population of millisecond pulsars and lmxbs in globular clusters .",
    "the details of the rest of the evolution ; i.e. how the neutron stars are spun up , is a matter for further study , but this paper should provide the tools to estimate the number of neutron stars the clusters have to work with .",
    "i would like to thank n. brandt for generating the binary systems and for useful advice on their use , and p. podsiadlowski and r. wijers for helpful discussions on neutron stars and comments on the manuscript .",
