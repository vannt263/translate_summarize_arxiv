    "the standard model of elementary particle physics has been in agreement with all experiments performed till date . the one ingredient that has not been found",
    "yet is the higgs boson .",
    "direct searches at lep200 have been able to put a lower limit of @xmath5 gev on its mass @xcite . as the presence of the higgs boson is necessary for the renormalizability of the theory , radiative processes calculated without taking into account the graphs containing virtual higgs bosons would be infinite .",
    "therefore radiative corrections should grow with the higgs - boson mass .",
    "it is a well - known effect , sometimes called veltman s theorem @xcite , that such corrections to low - energy parameters grow logarithmically with the higgs mass .",
    "therefore precision tests as performed at lep can use the existing data to put bounds on the higgs mass .",
    "an analysis of the data indicates that the higgs boson should be light ( @xmath6 gev ) @xcite",
    ". therefore the higgs boson should be found at the next generation of colliders .",
    "however there is some lingering doubt as to the unavoidability of this conclusion . on the one hand",
    "there is a slight discrepancy between the leptonic and the hadronic data in the precision measurements . taking the leptonic data",
    "only , the preferred value of the higgs boson mass would be so light as to almost rule out the standard model already .",
    "on the other hand one should not change the model too much , as one can get rather large effects quickly , for instance a fourth generation appears to be definitely ruled out .",
    "the one option that is not quite under theoretical control is the case of strong interactions , which corresponds to a naively very heavy higgs boson ( @xmath7 tev ) . in this case",
    "higher order corrections could be large and cancel the leading order @xmath8 effects , ultimately giving similar corrections as a light higgs boson .",
    "calculations at the two - loop order have been performed and actually give a negligeable effect @xcite .",
    "the reason for this has been traced back to some apparently accidental cancellations between the coefficients in the higgs mass dependent terms @xcite .",
    "these cancellations appear to be typical for the low - energy vector boson - propagator and triple - vector boson interactions only @xcite .",
    "corrections to e.g.  the four - vector boson interactions @xcite or the higgs - propagator @xcite do not exhibit such cancellations . therefore it may be possible that the full effect of the strong interactions shows up only at the three - loop level for the precision parameters at lep .",
    "it is therefore imperative to push the calculations towards the three - loop order .    of course , to determine the higgs mass effects it is necessary to also have the effects of the other particles under very precise control , as these may be dominating .",
    "a particularly important parameter here is the so - called @xmath0 parameter which measures the relative strengths of the neutral and charged currents . at the tree - level",
    "this parameter is one , due to a residual su(2 ) , so - called custodial symmetry .",
    "this symmetry gets violated by the hyper - charge and by mass - splittings within doublets . because the mass - splittings give contributions proportional to the square of the masses , the dominating effect is the contribution of the top quark ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass dependence is only logarithmic and proportional to the hypercharge coupling ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "since the higgs mass dependent effect is sub - dominant , it could be masked by higher loop effects coming from the top quark .",
    "therefore the higher loop top mass dependent corrections have to be calculated .",
    "as the top - yukawa coupling is not very small , one should check whether perturbation theory in the yukawa coupling is actually convergent .",
    "known corrections at the two - loop level are the leading ( @xmath11 ) and sub - leading ( @xmath12 ) contributions .",
    "numerically it was found that the subleading corrections are larger than the leading ones @xcite .",
    "this naturally brings up the question whether the three - loop effect could also be large .",
    "there is actually an extra enhancement of the three - loop correction , because there is a term behaving like @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the number of colors ) , whereas both one and two - loop corrections behave like @xmath14 .",
    "if indeed the three - loop correction would be comparable to the two - loop one , one should consider whether there is a way to resum at least the leading order terms , maybe by a borel summation .",
    "such a resummation is not always possible , as one would need an alternating sign in the series .",
    "so independent of its direct phenomenological implications it is important to know the three - loop heavy - top correction to @xmath15 , since it would give us a handle on the nature of perturbation theory in quantum field theory .",
    "not very many quantities are known to such precision .",
    "as far as the calculation is concerned one must remark that a complete calculation at the three - loop level is impossible analytically . at best this could be done numerically .",
    "however the situation is somewhat simplified by taking the top mass much larger than @xmath16 or @xmath17 . in this case",
    "one can perform an expansion in the external momenta .",
    "the feynman integrals that have to be calculated can then be reduced to vacuum graphs .",
    "these vacuum graphs are easier to calculate . at the two - loop level",
    "this program can be carried out till the end , as the vacuum - diagrams are known for arbitrary values of the masses . this way the leading and sub - leading corrections due to a heavy top quark",
    "have been calculated , including a full higgs mass dependence @xcite .",
    "numerically the higgs mass dependence is quite sizeable .",
    "unfortunately at the three - loop level vacuum diagrams are only known when there is one mass scale in the problem @xcite .",
    "that is , every line in the graph is either massless or has a fixed mass .",
    "mixed higgs - top graphs can therefore only be calculated when the higgs has the same mass as the top quark , or has mass zero .",
    "also qcd corrections can be taken into account analytically . in this letter",
    "we consider the case that the top mass is much heavier than all other masses , effectively working in the @xmath18 limit . within this limit",
    "we present the results of the calculation of the leading order @xmath19 and @xmath20 correction to @xmath15 .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in the next section we state our definition of the @xmath0 parameter and introduce our notations .",
    "section [ sec : diaren ] is devoted to a short discussion of the treatment of the diagrams and the renormalization . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results at order @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is usually defined by the ratio of the neutral and charged current coupling constants at zero momentum transfer : @xmath21 @xmath22 is given by the fermi coupling constant @xmath23 determined from the @xmath24 decay rate whereas @xmath25 is measured by neutrino scattering on electrons or hadrons .",
    "this definition of the @xmath0 parameter is principally speaking not process independent , since the radiative corrections depend on the value of the hypercharge of the particles in the process .",
    "however the leading terms in the top mass are process independent .",
    "the origin of the process dependence lies in the different hypercharge assignments of the particles that take part in the scattering cross - sections .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the origin of a non - zero value of @xmath15 is due to the breaking of the custodial su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "this breaking originates from either the hypercharge coupling or from the doublet mass - splittings . in leading order",
    "these effects are separate , but in higher order the effects of the yukawa and the gauge couplings become intricately intertwined . at the two - loop level",
    "there is a leading @xmath26 correction , that is independent of the gauge - couplings completely . even in the absence of the hypercharge field",
    "there is a subleading @xmath27 contribution .",
    "finally the exact sub - leading term becomes a function of the hypercharge coupling , giving rise to a more complicated formula as a function of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "as the whole correction is also strongly dependent on the higgs mass one should be careful in drawing conclusions from the large size of the subleading term compared to the leading term .",
    "this effect may be specific to the particular observable being calculated . in particular there appears to be an accidental cancellation between different coefficients in the leading term @xmath29 to @xmath15 for @xmath18 , which disappears for a larger higgs mass and which is absent in the correction to @xmath30 .    in leading order in the top mass contributions to @xmath0 stem from the transversal parts of the ( unrenormalized ) self energies of the exchanged vector bosons @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the bare masses of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bosons respectively .",
    "in this form the results would appear infinite , but these infinities are canceled by the higgs mass , top mass and @xmath31 boson mass renormalizations .",
    "corrections from vertex and box diagrams always involve extra powers of the weak coupling constant @xmath35 and are therefore suppressed by powers of @xmath36 , i.e.  @xmath37 .",
    "a remark is here in order . up to the two - loop level for the leading top mass effects the correction to @xmath0",
    "can be expressed in a number of equivalent ways , i.e.  in terms of @xmath11 or @xmath38 . at the three - loop level",
    "one must be more precise . at this level",
    "the difference between low - energy parameters and on - shell vector boson masses plays a role even in the leading @xmath39 effects . in the following",
    "we will express the final answer in terms of the on - shell top mass and the low - energy fermi constant @xmath23 from @xmath24-decay .",
    "there are four major contributions to the three - loop @xmath0 parameter which we will discuss below .",
    "first , the three - loop self energy diagrams of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 boson , of course .",
    "second , the top quark mass renormalization at order @xmath11 and @xmath40 .",
    "third , the renormalization of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and fourth , the higgs mass renormalization . for all contributions we have limited ourselves to the leading top quark mass effects which simplifies the computation drastically .    as far as the self energy diagrams of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 bosons are concerned we have chosen to compute an asymptotic expansion w.r.t .  the external momentum since we are interested in the zero momentum transfer limit . the treatment of the higgs mass has been done using two different approaches : first , an asymptotic expansion @xcite w.r.t .",
    "the higgs mass and second , setting the higgs mass equal to zero right from the start .",
    "both strategies lead to the same result as no higgs mass dependence is present in the final results .    throughout this computation",
    "we have used several computer programs and packages .",
    "the diagrams were generated using qgraf @xcite and the asymptotic expansion in limit of the small higgs mass was performed by exp @xcite .",
    "the resulting three - loop integrals were evaluated with the help of the program packages mincer @xcite and matad @xcite written in form @xcite .",
    "the two - loop top quark mass renormalization constant requires the calculation of two - loop on - shell diagrams .",
    "we have used the packages tarcer @xcite and onshell2 @xcite for the computation of these types of diagrams .",
    "the renormalization of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field is fixed by the requirement of vanishing higgs tadpoles .",
    "it also influences the higgs mass renormalization and the mass renormalization of the goldstone bosons .",
    "we need this renormalization constant up to two - loops and the computation of the tadpoles is straightforward .",
    "the mass renormalization of the higgs field is required only up to one - loop order .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the three - loop results read @xmath41 and @xmath42 the constants @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are given by ( see , e.g. @xcite ) @xmath46 ^ 2     = -3.027009\\dots    \\nonumber\\\\    b_4 & = &     16 \\mbox{li}_4 \\left ( \\frac{1}{2 } \\right )     - 4 \\zeta_2 \\ln^2 2    + \\frac{2}{3 } \\ln^4 2     - \\frac{13}{2 } \\zeta_4    = -1.762800\\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the di- and quadrilogarithm , respectively .    numerically , we find @xmath50 and , for @xmath51 , @xmath52 here the subleading two - loop correction is given again for the process of @xmath53 scattering and in order to see the pure effect of the top quark mass on @xmath54 the value @xmath55 was taken .",
    "for the realistic value of @xmath56 the subleading two - loop corrections are @xmath57 .",
    "for completeness we have also added to the r.h.s .  of ( [ result ] ) the well known term of order @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the size of the various terms in eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) is shown in table 1 .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "first , the coefficients of the perturbative series are alternating for both pure electroweak and mixed electroweak / strong corrections .",
    "second , the size of the three - loop electroweak coefficient is quite large and results in a correction to the leading two - loop contribution of approximately 36 % ( for @xmath59 ) .",
    "the size of the three - loop correction relative to the much larger subleading two - loop @xmath60 corrections ( [ drho21]-[drho210 ] ) is however about 2% .",
    "the mixed @xmath61 term is numerically less than the purely electroweak @xmath62 one by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "finally , the major part of the @xmath63 contribution to the @xmath0 parameter is given by the leading term in the large @xmath14 approximation .",
    "with respect to the question of the convergence of perturbation theory in the yukawa - coupling @xmath64 the results give only limited information . because of the dependence on @xmath14 one can actually study two different limits , selecting different subsets of graphs .",
    "the first possibility is to take the graphs with the largest number of fermion - loops into account , which is one less than the number of loops , starting at the two - loop level .",
    "formally one can project out these graphs by taking @xmath65 and take the limit @xmath66 . with the exception of one - loop all other loops are of the same order .",
    "one can thus only meaningfully compare the two - loop with the three - loop level .",
    "these become equal for @xmath67 , corresponding to @xmath68 gev .",
    "this would naively imply an early breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "such a conclusion however would be premature , as it is known that the two - loop @xmath0 parameter has a large cancellation between the different terms , that have not been observed for other quantities .",
    "the other limit is taking into account only graphs with one fermion - loop , which one can describe formally by taking the limit @xmath69 .",
    "here one has three terms in the perturbation expansion available and can therefore form the [ 1,1]-pad approximant .",
    "this gives @xmath70 for a large top mass ( @xmath71 ) this would imply a saturation of the radiative correction @xmath72 however also this early saturation could be an artefact , coming from the anomalously small two - loop leading term .",
    "all in all one gains little insight here without having a way to sum high - loop graphs .",
    "also a comparison with other quantities would be necessary as well as a study of the higgs mass dependence .",
    "we have analytically computed the leading contributions of the top quark to the electroweak @xmath0 parameter at order @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the correction of order @xmath73 is sizeable in comparison to the leading two - loop correction . as we have mentioned in the introduction",
    "the three - loop leading correction in principle could have happened to be of the same order of magnitude as the subleading @xmath75 two - loop correction .",
    "we have found , however , that in fact it is still much smaller than the subleading two - loop one .",
    "thereby we have significantly reduced the theoretical uncertainty of the results of electroweak higher order calculations coming from the enhanced three - loop large top quark mass contributions .",
