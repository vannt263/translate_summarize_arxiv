    "using the laser backscattering method one can obtain  and  colliding beams with an energy and luminosity comparable to that in  collisions or even higher ( due to the absence of some beam collision effects ) .",
    "this can be done with a relatively small incremental cost .",
    "the expected physics in these collisions is very rich and complementary to that in collisions .",
    "some characteristic examples are :    * a  collider provides the unique opportunities to measure the two - photon decay width of the higgs boson , and to search for relatively heavy higgs states in the extended higgs models such as mssm ; * a  collider is an outstanding @xmath4 factory , with a @xmath5 pair production cross section by a factor of 1020 larger than that in and with a potential of producing @xmath6 @xmath4 s per year , allowing a precision study of the anomalous gauge boson interactions ; * a ,  collider is a remarkable tool for searching for new charged particles , such as supersymmetric particles , leptoquarks , excited states of electrons , etc .",

    "two electron beams after the final focus system are traveling toward the interaction point ( ip ) . at a distance of about 1 cm upstream from the ip , at a conversion point ( cp ) ,",
    "the laser beam is focused and compton backscattered by the electrons , resulting in the high energy beam of photons . with reasonable laser parameters one can `` convert '' most of electrons to high energy photons .",
    "the photon beam follows the original electron direction of motion with a small angular spread of order @xmath7 , arriving at the ip in a tight focus , where it collides with a similar opposing high energy photon beam or with an electron beam .",
    "the photon spot size at the ip may be almost equal to that of electrons at ip and therefore the luminosity of ,  collisions will be of the same order as the `` geometric '' luminosity of basic @xmath8 beams .",
    "the energy spectrum of photons after the compton scattering for various polarization of electrons and laser photons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at the optimum laser wave length ( below the threshold of  pair creation ) , the maximum energy of scattered photons is about 82% of the initial electron energy .",
    "photons in the high energy part of spectrum can have high degree of polarization .",
    "this part of spectrum is most valuable for experiment .",
    "below we will deal mainly with  luminosity produced by high energy photons .    .",
    "[ fig4 ]    here we will not consider the general features of photon colliders , they are discribed in papers@xcite@xcite and proceedings of the berkeley workshop  @xcite .",
    "preliminary studies show that the photon colliders with an energy 2e@xmath9500 gev and acceptable luminosity  @xmath10 ( at @xmath11 ) can be built  @xcite .",
    "however , physicists will be happy to have larger luminosity to study details of some processes , for example @xmath12 .",
    "it is also of interest to investigate main properties of the photon colliders at higher energy . we know that linear colliders at an energy above 12 tev have serious problems .",
    "is it easier to explore this region with a photon collider ?",
    "the present paper is focused mainly on the study of limitations on the energy and luminosity of photon colliders .",
    "we understand that linear colliders will be built not sooner than in one decade and will work another one  two decades",
    ". therefore in discussions we will not confine ourselves by the present achievements and technologies .",
    "this concerns laser parameters ( for high energy photon collider a free electron laser is needed ) and emittances of electron beams . although fels with close parameters do not exist , but there are projects of such lasers .",
    "the way to very low emittances ( laser cooling ) was discussed at the first itp symposium  @xcite .    in the later paper",
    "it was also found how to overcome the problem of nonlinear effects in the conversion region which leads to the linear growth of the laser flash energy with the increase in the electron beam energy . in the proposed method of ` stretching ' the conversion region",
    "the required laser flash energy does not grow at all with energy .",
    "cross sections of the charged particle production in  collisions are somewhat higher than those in  collisions . at @xmath13",
    "the ratio of cross sections are the following : + @xmath14 .    to have the same statistics ( but complementary physics ) in collisions the luminosity can be smaller than that in collisions by a factor of 5 .",
    "cross sections decrease usually as @xmath15 , therefore the luminosity should grow proportionally to s. a reasonable scaling for the required  luminosity ( in the high energy peak of the luminosity distribution ) at  collider is @xmath16 with such a luminosity for the time @xmath17 one can detect + @xmath18 .",
    "somewhat larger luminosity ( @xmath19 ) is required for the search and study of the ` intermediate ' ( @xmath20 ) higgs boson which is produced as a single resonance in  collisions .",
    "we will see that such a level of luminosities at low energies is not a problem .",
    "the scaling ( 1 ) will be used for estimation of the maximum energy of photon colliders",
    ".    other important problem at high luminosities is a background due to large total cross section @xmath21 it consists of particles with @xmath22 gev uniformly ( at large angles ) distributed over the pseudorapidity @xmath23 with @xmath24 at @xmath25 gev .",
    "particle density grows only logarithmically with energy .",
    "the average number of hadron events / per bunch crossing is about one at @xmath26 and at the typical collision rate 5 khz . in this paper",
    ", we are interested mainly by the luminosity in the high energy part of luminosity spectrum . however , in the scheme without deflection of used electron beams the total  luminosity is larger than the ` useful ' @xmath27 by a factor 510 due to collisions of low energy compton photons and beamstrahlung photons . this low energy collisions increase background by a factor 23 . at @xmath28 tev with required @xmath29 ,",
    "this leads to about 30 ( effectively ) high energy @xmath30 events per bunch crossing .",
    "similar number of hadronic events / collision is expected at lhc .",
    "however , there is important an difference between pp and colliders : in the case of an interesting event ( high @xmath31 jets and leptons ) the total energy of final products at photon colliders is equal to @xmath32 , while at proton colliders it is only about ( 1/6)@xmath32 .",
    "the ratio of the signal to background at photon colliders is better by a factor 6 at the same number of hadronic events per crossing .",
    "moreover , during the reconstruction of an interesting event one can subtract smooth hadronic background and only its fluctuations are important which are proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "it means that for @xmath34 ( and fixed collision rate ) the ratio of signal to background is almost constant ( decreases only logarithmically ) .",
    "the above arguments shows that the problem of hadronic background is not dramatic for photon colliders .",
    "of course , some increase in the collision rate with an increase in the luminosity will be useful .",
    "we will see that due to collision effects the optimum number of particles in one bunch should decrease with energy , that naturally leads to an increase in the collision rate .",
    "there are two basic collision schemes @xcite :    there is no magnetic deflection of the spent electrons and all particles after the conversion region travel to the ip .",
    "the conversion point may be situated very close to the ip .",
    "after the conversion region particles pass through a region with a transverse magnetic field where electrons are swept aside .",
    "thereby , one can achieve a more or less pure  or  collisions .    during beam collision ,",
    "photons are influenced by the field of the opposing electron beam .",
    "one of the important processes in this field is a conversion of photons into  pairs ( coherent pair creation)@xcite . under a certain conditions , the conversion length is shorter than the length of interaction region ( @xmath35 ) and  luminosity is suppressed .",
    "the probability of pair creation per unit length by a photon with the energy @xmath36 in the magnetic field @xmath37 for our case ) is @xcite,@xcite , .    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the the critical field , @xmath40 is the classical radius of electron .",

    "the parameter @xmath58 belongs to the second range ( ` transition ' regime ) where @xmath59 .",
    "let us find now limits posed on the luminosity due to coherent pair creation for different collision schemes .",
    "there are three ways to avoid this effect ( i.e. to keep @xmath60 ) :    \\1 ) to use flat beams ;    \\2 ) to deflect the electron beam after conversion at a sufficiently large distance ( @xmath61 for @xmath62 ) from the interaction point(ip ) ;    \\3 ) under certain conditions ( low beam energy , long bunches ) @xmath63 at the ip due to the repulsion of electron beams @xcite .    let us consider at first requirements to the beam sizes in the case 1 .      the field of the beam with the r.m.s horizontal size @xmath64 and the length @xmath65 is @xmath66 . from the condition",

    ". this prediction will be checked by the simulation .",
    "in fact , at low enough energy this effect allows to use even infinitely narrow electron beams with any reasonable number of particles in the bunch and the minimum photon spot size is @xmath100 , where @xmath78 should be taken as small as possible . at high energies this effect also works but",
    "the number of particles in the bunch should be below some number dependent of the energy ( eq.17 ) .",
    "using the magnetic field @xmath101 between the conversion and interaction regions one can sweep out electrons from the interaction point at some distance @xmath61 sufficient for the suppression of coherent pair creation , i.e. to satisfy condition @xmath102 given by eq.6 .",

    "the luminosity is proportional to @xmath101 and one can take larger field values but it poses some technical problems .",
    "one should also remember that in the transverse magnetic field , the soft background particles produced in the forward direction ( mainly  pairs ) get a kick , begin to spiral in the detector field and to avoid backgrounds the radius of the vacuum pipe should exceed @xmath112 .    considering the scheme with deflection we did not consider the field created by the produced  pairs .",
    "these particles are closer to the beam axis than the deflected beam and their field can even exceed the field of the opposing electron beam .",
    "therefore , our optimization of pair creation overestimates the luminosity .",
    "we will see results of simulation in next sections .",

    "it happens at @xmath64 very close to our prediction , eq(12 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ sb2 ] we can see the dependence of the luminosity both on n and @xmath65 in the case where beams are round and the conversion region is situated as close as possible : @xmath122 $ ]  .",
    "the total beam power is 15@xmath123 $ ] mw . looking to this pictures one can make many own observations which are clear after our theoretical consideration . note only that the longer bunch requires the larger laser flash energy for conversion ( @xmath124 ) and not every linac ( among the current projects ) can accelerate a 0.5 mm long bunch due to wake fields .",
    "let us take for further study @xmath125 mm .",
    "the dependence of the luminosity on @xmath64 ( other conditions are the same as in the previous figure ) is depicted in fig .",
    "it is desirable to choose the working point ( @xmath126 ) so that not only the luminosity is large but also the corresponding curve still follows their natural behavior @xmath127 .",
    "this means that the @xmath128 conversion probability is still not too high .",
    "otherwise it may happen that the low energy  luminosity will be much larger than that in the high energy part ( low energy photons have smaller probability of conversion ) .",
    "for example : at e = 2.5 tev one can reach @xmath129with all considered number of particles in the bunch .    the values of @xmath64 and  where curves make zigzag are in good agreement with eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "even higher luminosities at e = 2.5 tev can be reached with @xmath130@xmath131 , but in the case @xmath132 it happens after zigzag on the curve that manifests that many photons have converted to  pairs .",
    "the best choice here is @xmath133 , where one can reach @xmath134 without problems .",
    "the only problem here is a too small transverse beam size : @xmath135 .    at low energies",
    "the situation is perfect and one can dream about ww factory at the collider with an energy 2e = 5001000 gev and luminosity upto @xmath136    fig .",
    "[ sb4 ] presents the result for the scheme with magnetic deflection .",
    "the strength of magnetic field is equal 0.5 t and the distance @xmath78 is varied . for the comparison",
    "the case @xmath137 is also shown .",
    "we see that the magnetic deflection helps at large @xmath78 but the luminosity value in this region is much lower than that in the case of flat beams where conversion point is situated very close to the ip .",
    "nevertheless , although magnetic deflection does not help to reach ultimate luminosities , in  practical  cases ( where the luminosity is far from the limit ) the magnetic deflection helps to decrease the low energy  luminosity without degradation of the high energy part .    comparing our luminosity scaling law ( eq.1 ) with the results of the simulation we see that the required luminosity can be reached at least up to @xmath138 with any ( up to @xmath139 ) number of particles in the bunch .",
    "note that in our examples the collision rate is @xmath140=10 khz@xmath141 .",
    "the higher @xmath140 is good for the experiment but makes some problems for the required average laser power .",
    "it seems that f=1030 khz is still acceptable . with n=0.3@xmath142 one",
    "can reach at 2e=5 tev even a few times higher luminosity than that it is ` required ' .",
    "the main problem here is connected with attainable beam emittances .",
    "only short remark .",
    "the normalized emittances which are written in the current projects @xcite do not allow to follow the scaling low above 2e = 1 tev .",
    "an increase in luminosity at low energies or motion towards high energies requires serious r&d work on low emittance electron beams .",
    "one new suggestion was reported at the itp workshops@xcite .",
    "this is laser cooling which allows to cool beams down to values necessary for all parameters of photon colliders considered here .",
    "at @xmath143 the conventional linear colliders reach their limit both in  and in  mode .",
    "the number of problems grows exponentially : acceleration gradient , very small beam sizes , radiation , pair creation .",
    "the reason is common for all mode of operation :    \\1 ) the required luminosity is proportional to @xmath144 ;    \\2 ) energetic problem , because beams are used only once ( but namely this feature makes possible to consider photon colliders ) .",
