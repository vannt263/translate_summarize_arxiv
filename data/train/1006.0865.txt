    "the diffusive behavior of brownian particles depends mainly on their size , the interaction between them , and the environment where they are situated in . if , in addition to these characteristics , particles are confined within narrow , tortuous structures such as nanopores , zeolites , biological cells and microfluidic devices , the restriction of the space available for the particles will cause entropic barriers that will have strong impact on the diffusive behavior ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "effective control schemes for transport in these systems require a detailed understanding of the diffusive mechanisms involving small objects and , in this regard , an operative measure to gauge the role of fluctuations .",
    "the study of these transport phenomena is , in many respects , equivalent to an investigation of geometrical constrained brownian dynamics . as the role of inertia for the motion of the particles through these structures",
    "can typically be neglected , the brownian dynamics can safely be analyzed by solving the smoluchowski equation in the domain defined by the available free space upon imposing reflecting boundary conditions at the domain walls .",
    "however , solving the boundary problem in the case of nontrivial , corrugated domains presents a difficult task . a way to circumvent this difficulty consists in coarsening the description by reducing the dimensionality of the system considering only the main transport direction , but taking into account the physically available space by means of an entropic potential @xcite .",
    "the resulting kinetic equation for the probability distribution , the so - called fick - jacobs equation , is similar in form to the smoluchowski equation , but contains now entropic contributions leading to genuine dynamics which distinctly differs from those observed for purely energetic potentials .",
    "the driven transport of particles across bottlenecks @xcite , such as ion transport through artificial nanopores or artificial ion pumps @xcite or in biological channels @xcite , are striking examples where the diffusive transport is regulated by entropic barriers .",
    "in addition , geometrical confinements and entropic barriers play also a prominent role in the context of the stochastic resonance phenomenon @xcite .",
    "our objective with this work is to investigate the mobility of noninteracting spherical brownian particles in channels with varying cross - section width . in particular , we are interested in the influence of the particle size on the transport within a periodic entropic potential exhibiting barriers which arise from the geometrical restrictions .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the model and define the theoretical and numerical problem .",
    "further on , in section 3 we present the basic principles of the fick - jacobs approximation allowing for reducing the two - dimensional problem to an one - dimensional one .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , we give the main conclusions in section 5 .",
    "transport through pores or channels ( like the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) may be caused by different particle concentrations maintained at the ends of the channel , or by the application of external forces acting on the particles .",
    "here , we exclusively consider the case of force driven transport of spherical particles of radius @xmath2 .",
    "the external force @xmath3 is pointing parallel to the direction of the channel axis .",
    "as small deviation from this assumption does not affect our results , certainly not within the limits of validity of the ficks - jacob approximation .",
    "moreover , we shall assume low concentrations of spherical particles such that particle - particle interactions and all hydrodynamic interaction effects can consistently be neglected .",

    "since for a fast equilibration in the orthogonal tube direction the timescale for the orthogonal diffusion process must be smaller than the timescale for the drift @xcite , a smaller maximum channel width favors the validity of the fick - jacobs approximation .",

    "[ fig : nm ] ( a ) .",
    "moreover , upon decreasing the bottleneck half - width ( i.e. decreasing the aspect ratio @xmath93 ) of the structure , the nonlinear mobility decreases @xcite .    deviations from the @xmath94-dependence show another effect of the geometrical confinement , cf .",
    "[ fig : nm ] ( a ) . in order to focus on the geometrical effect",

    "as a consequence , the sojourn time , the particle spends on average in a bulge of the channel structure decreases with increasing @xmath42 and the mobility of the point particle in the effective geometry grows .",

    "as we keep the bottleneck - width constant and decrease the maximum half - width , the sojourn times the particles spends in the bulges decreases causing the mobility to increase and approach the maximum value for a straight channel ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , cf .",

    "the effective boundary function shows a kink and the effective maximum half - width @xmath103 decreases faster than linearly with the radii ratio @xmath42 .",
    "as the sojourn times the particle spend in the channel s bulges depends mainly on the effective maximum width , a nonlinear dependence of the nonlinear mobility is observed for larger particle radii causing a peak in the scaled nonlinear mobility , cf .",
    "[ fig : nm2 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "we studied the transport of finite brownian particles through channels with periodically varying width . for point size particles",
    "it was shown previously @xcite , that the transport through such channels could be approximately described by means of the so - called fick - jacobs equation which is based on the assumption of a fast equilibration in orthogonal transport direction .",
    "validity criteria for the capability of this approximation include a dependence on the channel shape and predict an upper limit for the force value . in case of spherical , finite size particles the maximum force value up to which the fick - jacobs equation could be applied depends also on the size of the particle . by comparison of the approximative result for the nonlinear mobility and the numerical ones we have shown , that the equilibration assumptions holds for a wider force - range in case of larger particles than it is the case for smaller ones .",
    "in addition , we pointed out , that the transport of finite , spherical brownian particles in channel geometries with highly corrugated channel walls exhibits some striking features which may allow for the development of newly separation devices which extends the functionality of the sieves .",
    "in particular we found , that the nonlinear mobility of brownian particles in such channel structures deviates from the one - over - size dependence predicted by the stokes law for brownian particles moving in an environment without geometrical constrictions .",
    "instead , there is an optimal particle size for which the nonlinear mobility as compared to the free mobility exhibits a maximum value .",
    "our present study also implicitly used a small concentration of spherical particles such that both , effects of particle - particle interactions and forces between particle - particle and particle - walls due to hydrodynamic interactions can safely be ignored .",
    "these complications would require totally new and extensive studies that are beyond this present study .",
    "moreover , as emphasized with the abstract already , we assumed throughout perfect spherical symmetry .",
    "deviations from such spherical symmetry would also impact the viscous friction law behavior @xcite and , as well , may give rise to additional , new entropic effects .",
    "all such complications are beyond the work presented here ; all these latter complications , however , open up avenues for interesting future investigations .",
