    "in quantum theory , we usually assume that probability densities for eigenvalues of two noncommuting observables can not be measured by the same experimental set up .",

    "of course , the projector @xmath288 associated with the chain @xmath267 already provides us with a large class of solutions , but certainly not all the solutions .",
    "we have investigated the extent to which it is possible to reproduce a given set of joint probability distributions @xmath289 with @xmath31 or @xmath32 , in arbitrary number @xmath1 and with arbitrary position - momentum assignments of the @xmath35 s , as marginals of some probability density @xmath74 in @xmath0-dimensional phase space .",
