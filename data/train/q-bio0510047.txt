    "dna microarrays are used as a tool for analyzing information in gene expression data over a broad range of biological applications such as cancer classification @xcite , cancer prognosis @xcite and identifications of cell cycle - regulated genes of yeast @xcite . during the laboratory process",
    ", some spots on the array may be missing due to various factors ( for example , machine error . ) because it is often very costly and time consuming to repeat the experiment , molecular biologists , statisticians , and computer scientists have made attempts to recover the missing gene expressions by some ad - hoc or systematic methods .",
    "microarray gene expression data is often represented as a gene expression matrix @xmath0 with @xmath1 rows , which correspond to genes , and @xmath2 columns , which correspond to experiments .",
    "thus @xmath3 is the expression of the gene @xmath4 in the @xmath5 experiment .",
    "typically @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath2 . in this setting ,",
    "the analysis of missing gene expressions on the array would translate to recovering missing entries in the gene expression matrix values .    in the last six years",
    "there have been at least six published papers in the literature discussing the problems of missing gene expression data and algorithms to recover them : the bayesian principal component analysis ( bpca ) @xcite ; the fixed rank approximation algorithm ( fraa ) @xcite ; the weighted k - nearest neighbors ( knnimpute ) @xcite ; the least squares principal ( lsp ) @xcite ; the local least squares imputation method ( lls ) @xcite ; the projection onto convex sets methods ( pocs ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to introduce the improved fixed rank approximation algorithm ( ifraa ) .",
    "we compare ifraa with bpca and lls , since the software programs for implementing these methods are easily available .",
    "we have omitted comparison with knnimpute , since the simulations of @xcite and @xcite show that bpca and lls are superior to knnimpute .",
    "knnimpute and lls are local methods , which use similarity structure of the data to impute the missing values .",
    "knnimpute uses the weighted averages of the @xmath6-nearest uncorrupted neighbors .",
    "lls has two versions to find similar genes whose expressions are not corrupted : the @xmath7-norm and the pearson s correlation coefficients . after a group of similar genes",
    "@xmath8 are identified , the missing values of the gene are obtained using least squares applied to the group @xmath8 . in these two methods , the recovery of missing data is done independently , i.e. the estimation of each missing entry does not influence the estimation of the other missing entries .",
    "bpca is a global method consisting of three components .",
    "first , principal component regression , which is basically a low rank approximation of the data set is performed .",
    "second , bayesian estimation , which assumes that the residual error and the projection of each gene on principal components behave as normal independent random variables with unknown parameters , is carried out .",
    "third , bayesian estimation follows by iterations based on the expectation - maximization ( em ) of the unknown bayesian parameters .",
    "ifraa is a combination of fraa , developed in @xcite , and a good clustering algorithm .",
    "one first applies fraa , whose description is below , to complete the missing data .",
    "then one applies a clustering algorithm to group the data to a small number of clusters of data with similar characteristics . in each cluster fraa",
    "is applied again to update the estimated values of missing entries in the cluster .",
    "fraa is a global method which finds the values of the missing entries of the gene expression matrix @xmath9 , such that the obtained @xmath9 minimizes the objective function @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the sum of the squares of all but the first @xmath11 singular values of an @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath10 is considered on the set @xmath14 , which is the set of all possible choices of matrices @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 if the entry @xmath3 is known .",
    "the completion matrix @xmath9 is computed iteratively , by a local minimization of @xmath10 on @xmath14 .",
    "the estimation of missing entries in fraa is done simultaneously , i.e. , the estimation of one missing entry influences the estimation of the other missing entries .",
    "let @xmath9 be the @xmath12 gene expression matrix , where @xmath17 . assume first that @xmath9 does not have missing entries .",
    "recall the _ singular value decomposition _ of @xmath18 , called svd , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be the @xmath2 singular values of @xmath9 , which are the nonnegative roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be the column orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath23 and @xmath20 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath24 respectively . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are called the left and the right orthonormal singular column vectors of @xmath9",
    ". then @xmath27 is @xmath12 matrix , with the columns @xmath28 , @xmath29 is an @xmath30 matrix , with columns @xmath26 , and @xmath31 is the diagonal @xmath30 matrix , with @xmath32 on the main diagonal .",
    "thus @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the principal directions of the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the rank @xmath34 of @xmath9 is equal to the number of positive singular values of @xmath9 . for each @xmath35 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath36 is the best @xmath37 approximation matrix of rank @xmath11 .",
    "that is if @xmath38 is any @xmath12 matrix of rank @xmath11 at most , than @xmath39 .",
    "( @xmath40 is the euclidean norm of @xmath9 viewed as a vector with @xmath41 coordinates . )",
    "an integer @xmath42 $ ] is called the _ effective rank _ of @xmath9 , if @xmath11 is the smallest integer for which @xmath43 is much smaller than @xmath44 . then @xmath45 is called the _ filtered _ @xmath9 , and @xmath45 can be viewed as the noise reduction of @xmath9 .    in microarray analysis of the gene expression matrix @xmath9 , the vectors @xmath25 are called _ eigengenes _ , the vectors @xmath26 are called _ eigenarrays _ and @xmath32 are called _",
    "eigenexpressions_. the effective rank @xmath11 of @xmath9 can be viewed as the number of different biological functions of @xmath1 genes observed in @xmath2 experiments .",
    "the eigenarrays @xmath46 give the principal @xmath11 orthogonal directions in @xmath47 corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "the eigengenes @xmath49 give the principal @xmath11 orthogonal directions in @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "the eigen expressions describe the relative significance of each bio - function . from the data given in @xcite ,",
    "one concludes that the number of significant singular values never exceeds @xmath51 .",
    "the essence of the fraa algorithm is based on this observation .",
    "computationally , one brings @xmath9 to an upper bidiagonal matrix @xmath38 using householder matrices .",
    "then one applies implicitly the qr algorithm to @xmath52 to find the positive eigenvalues @xmath53 and the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath54 of the matrix @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "assume now that @xmath9 is the gene expression matrix with missing data .",
    "we can estimate the effective rank of @xmath9 by computing the effective rank of the submatrix @xmath55 , corresponding to all genes with uncorrupted entries ( * ? ? ?",
    "let @xmath11 be our estimate for the effective rank of the completed gene expression matrix .",
    "denote by @xmath14 the set of all @xmath12 matrices whose entries coincide with the uncorrupted entries of @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath14 is the set of all possible completion of the corrupted gene matrix @xmath9 .",
    "fraa completes the missing values of @xmath9 by finding the minimum to the following optimization problem : @xmath56 ideally , @xmath57 is the completion of the gene matrix expression with missing values . in practice , fraa uses the following iterative procedure :    @xmath58    * fixed rank approximation algorithm : * _ let @xmath59 be the @xmath60 approximation to a solution of optimization problem ( [ prob2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath61 and find an orthonormal set of eigenvectors for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath64 is a solution to the following minimum of a convex nonnegative quadratic function _",
    "@xmath65 .    @xmath58    the flow chart of this algorithm can be given as :    @xmath58    @xmath58    in each step of the algorithm we decrease the value of @xmath10 : @xmath66 .",
    "hence the sequence @xmath67 converges to a critical point @xmath68 .",
    "thus fraa gives a good approximation of @xmath69 .",
    "in many simulations we had we confirmed that @xmath70 .",
    "consider the following inverse eigenvalue problem ( iep ) : _ find the values of the missing entries of @xmath9 such that the nonnegative definite matrix @xmath20 will have @xmath71 smallest eigenvalues equal to zero .",
    "_ iep appear often in engineering .",
    "see @xcite for examples of iep and a number of good algorithms to solve these problems .",
    "in fact , fraa is based on one of the algorithms for the inverse eigenvalue problems discussed in @xcite .    as pointed out in @xcite fraa",
    "is a robust algorithm which performs good , but not as well as knnimpute .",
    "the reason of the superiority of knnimpute lies in fact that it reconstruct the missing values of each gene from similar genes .",
    "ifraa discussed here overcomes this disadvantage .",
    "ifraa works as follows .",
    "first we use fraa to find a completion @xmath9 .",
    "then we use a cluster algorithm , ( we used k - means by repeating and refining the cluster size ) , to find a reasonable number of clusters of similar genes .",
    "presumably each cluster is a relatively smaller matrix having an effective low rank . for each cluster of genes we apply fraa separately to recover the missing entries in this cluster .",
    "it turns out that this modification results in a very efficient algorithm for reconstructing the missing values of the gene expression matrix .",
    "we also note that ifraa performs best in reconstructing missing values of @xmath12 matrices , which have low effective ranks . _",
    "these results suggest that ifraa has a potential for being an effective algorithm to recover blurred spots in digital images_.",
    "for comparison of different imputation algorithms , six different types of data sets were used , consisting of four microarray gene expression data and two randomly generated synthetic data .",
    "two data sets of microarray were obtained from studies for the identification of cell - cycle regulated genes in yeast ( _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ ) @xcite .",
    "the first gene expression data set is a complete matrix of @xmath72 genes and 14 experiments based on the elutriation data set in @xcite .",
    "the second microarray data set is based on cdc15 data set in @xcite , which contains 5611 genes and 24 experiments .",
    "two other yeast data sets obtained from `` http:// sgdlite.princeton.edudownloadyeast_datasets '' .",
    "the evolution data set has been studied in @xcite and calcineurin data set has been studied in @xcite .",
    "two synthetic data set was randomly generated matrices of size @xmath73 and ranks @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .    to assess the performance of missing value estimation methods",
    ", we performed the following simulations . on the first two microarray data sets and on the synthetic data we deleted randomly @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 of the entries from the complete matrix @xmath8 .",
    "then we estimated the various completions of the missing values by bpca , ifraa and lls .",
    "we set the k - value parameter ( number of similar genes ) such that there was no increase in performance of the lls by increasing k.    we used a normalized root mean square error ( nrmse ) as a metric for comparison .",
    "if @xmath8 represents the complete matrix and @xmath81 represents the completed matrix using an estimate to the corrupted entries in @xmath8 , then the root mean square error ( rmse ) is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "we normalized the root mean square error by dividing rmse by the average value of the entries in @xmath8 .    in ifraa",
    "the parameter @xmath84 , which is the number of significant singular values plus @xmath44 , was chosen by comparison of ratio of two consequent singular values .",
    "we observed that this parameter appeared to be equal to 2 or 3 depending on data set and may differ for each small block of data ( cluster ) .",
    "the initial guess for the missing entries in each gene was chosen to be the row average of its corresponding row .",
    "figure 1 depicts the comparison of bpca , ifraa and lls for elutriation data set in @xcite .",
    "we break the whole gene expression matrix by clustering the data into groups of genes , which form matrices with effective low ranks .",
    "we applied fraa on each group .",
    "the graph is the average over 25 runs , and as can be seen for this data set ifraa performed the best , bpca and lls have very close performance with significant gap with ifraa .",
    "figure 2 depicts the comparison of bpca , and lls for cdc15 data set in @xcite which contains 5611 genes and 24 experiments . in this case",
    "ifraa again performed the best and llsimpute performed slightly better than bpca .",
    "the performance of the bcpa , ifraa and lls algorithms depends on the unknown distribution of missing position of the entries . to study this issue we applied all methods on the original data sets containing missing values . since nrms error could not be calculated for these actual missing values , we transferred the missing value positions from the original data to corresponding positions in the complete data derived from the original data set before applying the algorithm . by doing this",
    "the distribution of missing value positions in complete data set is almost unchanged from the actual distribution .",
    "the result is illustrated in table i for three data sets including the original data set of cdc15 which contains @xmath85 missing values ( @xmath86 missing in complete data ) , evolution data set @xcite which contains @xmath87 missing values ( @xmath88 missing in complete data ) and calcineurin data set @xcite which contains @xmath89 missing values ( @xmath90 missing in complete data ) .",
    "this result again confirms the superiority of the ifraa for the actual microarray data missing value estimation .",
    "the random matrices of order @xmath91 and of ranks @xmath92 appearing in figures 3 and 4 were generated as follows .",
    "one generates @xmath93 random column vectors @xmath94 , where the entries of these vectors are chosen according to an uniform distribution",
    ". then @xmath95 .",
    "figure 3 represents the comparisons of bpca , ifraa and lls for @xmath96 random matrix of rank @xmath74 .",
    "the performance of the three algorithms is excellent for @xmath76 of missing data .",
    "the performance of lls constantly deteriorates with the increase percentage of missing data .",
    "the performance of bpca deteriorated with the increase percentage of missing data , but less than lls .",
    "ifraa performed outstandingly .",
    "figure 4 represents the comparisons of bpca , ifraa and lls for @xmath96 random matrix of rank @xmath75 .",
    "the performance of lls is the same as in figure 3 .",

    "we compared ifraa to the bayesian principal component analysis ( bpca ) and the local least squares imputation method ( lls ) .",
    "we applied the three algorithms to several data sets .",
    "we corrupted , at random , certain percentages of these data sets and let the three algorithms bpca , ifraa and lls recover them .",
