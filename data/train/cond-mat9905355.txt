    "titin , a giant protein molecule responsible for elasticity of muscles , is comprised of a few hundred immunoglobulin ( ig ) and fibronectin - iii repeats aligned in tandem @xcite .",
    "recently , through nanomanipulation of single protein molecules , there has been direct evidence for sequential unfolding of individual domains upon stretching @xcite .",
    "these remarkable experiments and others on dna @xcite have made it possible to unearth the microscopic underpinnings of the unusual elastic behavior in biological molecules . in two experiments",
    "@xcite individual titin molecules were tethered to a plastic bead and optical tweezers were used to stretch the molecule .",
    "direct measurement of the forces required to stretch titin were used to infer that tension leads to unfolding of individual ig - like domains @xcite .",
    "perhaps , the clearest evidence for domain unraveling was presented by rief _",
    "_ @xcite who used atomic force microscopy ( afm ) to pull on titin molecules adsorbed onto a gold surface .",
    "the afm experiments , on both the model recombinant titin molecules consisting only of ig ( ig@xmath2 and ig@xmath3 ) domains and the native titin , showed clear saw - tooth patterns in the force - extension curves indicating sequential unfolding of domains .",
    "the constant periodicity of the saw - tooth pattern ( @xmath4 ) is nearly coincident with the dimensions of the fully unfolded ig domain ( @xmath5 ) and is very similar to the contour length inferred from fitting the force - extension curves obtained from the optical tweezer experiments @xcite ( see also related experiments on tenascin @xcite ) .",
    "all the experiments conclude that sequential unraveling of the domains results upon mechanically stretching titin .    inspired by these experiments , we report the results of force - induced unfolding of single domain proteins using simple lattice models which have been useful in the search for general principles of protein folding @xcite .",
    "because the primary mechanism of stretching titin involves unraveling of individual ig - like domains , which fold spontaneously in the absence of tension @xcite , our calculations provide microscopic origins of force induced unfolding .",
    "we show that the response of proteins to force depends primarily on their topology in the absence of force . by computing the phase diagram and kinetics of a number of model proteins subject to tension",
    "we show that the folding free energy landscape @xcite in the absence of force can be deciphered using single molecule manipulation techniques .",
    "the polypeptide chain is modeled as a sequence of @xmath6 connected beads on a cubic lattice .",
    "the energy of a conformation ( given by the vectors @xmath7 with @xmath8 ) is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the kronecker delta function , @xmath11 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath12 is the contact energy between beads @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the set of matrix elements @xmath12 specifies a sequence .",
    "we use two types of contact potentials , the statistical potentials derived by kolinski , godzik , and skolnick ( kgs ) @xcite and the random bond ( rb ) model @xcite .",
    "the applied force to the terminal beads yields an additional energy @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the extension . since the polypeptide chain is on lattice , where continuous overall rotations are not possible , we assume that upon stretching there is alignment of the protein along the force direction with zero torque .",
    "this is equivalent to the assumption that the relaxation time for the overall rotational degrees of freedom is much shorter than that for structural relaxation that is responsible for unfolding or folding processes .",
    "thus we take the absolute value of @xmath17 to represent the energy due to stretching .",
    "the total energy of the chain conformation is given by the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ ep ] ) and ( [ ef ] ) .",
    "we use dimensionless units for energy whose typical value is in the range @xmath18 ; length is measured in units of @xmath11 ( = 0.38@xmath19 ) , and temperature is measured in units of energy/@xmath20 . for purposes of mapping these to physical values we use @xmath21 for energy which means force in our simulations",
    "is measured in multiples of about @xmath22 .",
    "the thermodynamics as a function of force ( @xmath0 ) and temperature ( @xmath23 ) is obtained using a variant of the multiple histogram method @xcite in conjunction with standard metropolis monte carlo simulations @xcite . when @xmath24 the collection of histograms at different temperatures and zero force becomes unreliable because highly stretched conformations are almost never sampled",
    ". such states , which have negligible boltzmann weight in the absence of force , become thermodynamically important upon stretching .",
    "it proves more convenient to collect histograms at a fixed value of @xmath23 and at various values of @xmath0 so that all relevant states across the entire @xmath25 plane are adequately sampled .    to characterize the degree of similarity of an arbitrary sequence conformation with the native structure we use the overlap function @xcite defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance between the beads @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ", @xmath28 is the corresponding distance in the native conformation , and @xmath29 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "the kinetic simulations of force - induced unfolding were performed at a constant temperature @xmath30 ( below @xmath31 , the folding temperature ) that satisfies the condition @xmath32 .",
    "starting from the native conformation the force was suddenly increased to @xmath33 so that at @xmath34 stretched rod - like conformations are stable .",
    "the unfolding kinetics is monitored by computing the distribution of stretch times , @xmath35 , which is the first instance a trajectory @xmath13 reaches a stretched state with no contacts .",
    "typically @xmath36 trajectories have been generated for the calculation of unfolding rate . from the distribution of stretch times the mean unfolding time and the fraction of folded molecules at time @xmath37",
    "can be calculated @xcite .",
    "these probes together with the dynamics of rupture of tertiary contacts and the time dependence of extension are used to obtain the unfolding pathways .",
    "the mean unfolding time is @xmath38 the inverse of which is the unfolding rate @xmath39 .    in order to obtain the general characteristics of force - induced unfolding we computed the phase diagram and kinetics for five sequences ( four 27-mers and one 36-mer ) and differing interaction potentials .",
    "we chose four 27-mer and one 36-mer sequences , whose thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics in the absence of force are documented elsewhere @xcite , to investigate unfolding transitions upon stretching .",
    "three of the 27-mer and 36-mer sequences fold kinetically and thermodynamically by two - state mechanism .",
    "these sequences have small values of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the collapse and folding transition temperatures respectively when @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the fourth 27-mer sequence with @xmath12 given by rb potentials has @xmath44 , and its folding ( thermodynamics and kinetics ) reveals intermediates @xcite .",
    "thus , with these sequences , we can investigate the effect of stretching for protein - like models that display distinct folding mechanisms in the absence of force . for purposes of illustration we present results for a 36-mer sequence with the kgs potentials ( @xmath45 ) and the 27-mer rb model sequence with @xmath46 .",
    "the phase diagram for the 36-mer , which exhibits two - state cooperative thermal unfolding when @xmath43 , is given in fig .",
    "the states of the polypeptide chain are represented by the thermal average overlap function @xmath47 , where @xmath48 gives the degree of similarity to the native state . in particular ,",
    "small values of the overlap function correspond to conformations that belong to the native basin of attraction ( nba ) .",
    "the color codes in fig .",
    "( 1 ) are such that red corresponds to small @xmath49 ( high native content and folded states ) , while the blue region has large @xmath47 representing unfolded states .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "( 1a ) that the @xmath25 plane divides into predominantly red ( folded states ) and blue ( unfolded states ) regions . in the red region , the overlap @xmath50 and",
    "the probability of being in the nba is greater than 0.5 @xcite . in the blue region",
    "@xmath47 is typically greater than 0.8 and the probability of being in the nba is almost zero .",
    "there is only a narrow band of the green region which suggests that the force - induced unfolding transition for this sequence is an all - or - none process with no signature of intermediates .",
    "the sharp boundary between folded and unfolded states resembles that of the type i superconductors in the @xmath51 plane where @xmath52 is the applied magnetic field . with this analogy the locus of points separating the nba and the unfolded states",
    "is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the critical force required to unfold the protein , @xmath55 is the value of @xmath54 at @xmath56 , and @xmath42 is the folding transition temperature at zero force .",
    "both @xmath55 and @xmath57 depend on the sequence and the native state topology .",
    "the fit using eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) gives @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the 36-mer .",
    "an independent estimate for @xmath55 can be made by using @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the energy of the native state and @xmath62 is the gain in the end - to - end distance of the polypeptide chain upon stretching to a fully extended rod state .",
    "for the 36-mer @xmath63 and @xmath64 that leads to @xmath65 .    the phase diagram for a sequence whose folding ( in the absence of force ) involves intermediates is shown in fig .",
    "although the general appearance is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "( 1a ) there are clear differences .",
    "the region of stability of the nba ( red region ) is confined to low temperatures and small forces .",
    "secondly , the boundary between the folded and unfolded states is fuzzy and contains a broad green region .",
    "this suggests that the force ( or temperature)-induced unfolding is likely to be non - cooperative involving intermediates .",
    "this is reflected in the force - extension curves which show signatures of intermediates ( d. klimov & d. thirumalai , unpublished ) .",
    "in contrast , for two - state folders with @xmath45 , the force - extension curves show that at @xmath66 the chain abruptly unfolds to a stretched conformation without populating any detectable intermediates .",
    "in fact , the unfolding transition occurs in an extremely narrow interval of force which for the 36-mer is @xmath67 ( d. klimov & d. thirumalai , unpublished ) .",
    "we shall point out that the contact interaction energies ( or more precisely the potential of mean force ) are dependent on temperature .",
    "it has been argued that the temperature dependence of contact interactions has to be included in order to reproduce certain experimental observations in proteins @xcite .",
    "however , we expect the qualitative features of the phase diagrams seen in fig .",
    "( 1 ) will be observed experimentally regardless of the details of the interaction energies .",
    "how is the completely stretched conformation kinetically reached starting from the native conformation when @xmath0 exceeds @xmath54 ?",
    "for the four sequences with small @xmath68 ( two - state folders in the absence of force ) we find that , when averaged over an ensemble of initial molecules , unfolding occurs in a single kinetic step .",
    "however , there is a great variation in the time scales of stretching to the rod - like state .",
    "this is dramatically illustrated in fig .",
    "( 2a ) in which we plot , for the 36-mer , extension @xmath69 as a function of @xmath37 measured in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) .",
    "there is a large unexpected heterogeneity in the approach to the stretched state .",
    "a striking feature in fig .",
    "( 2a ) is that there is a large variability in the times taken to exhibit significant stretching prior to reaching the rod - like conformation .",
    "global unraveling takes place cooperatively with the disruption of local and non - local contacts occurring in an all - or - none manner .",
    "these features are masked in the ensemble average @xmath70 which is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "there is a remarkable similarity between the response of these protein - like models to force and that exhibited by flexible polymers subject to sudden elongational flow @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature of the unfolding dynamics is that , just as in experiments , the force - extension curves show hysteresis during the stretch - release cycles ( d. klimov & d. thirumalai , unpublished ) .",
    "the time evolution of the distribution of extension values @xmath17 for 400 trajectories is plotted in fig .",
    "this plot shows that on time scales less than mean stretch time the chain explores a diverse manifold of states each with different @xmath17 .",
    "certain @xmath17 values have significantly larger probability @xmath71 than the others which suggests that unfolding occurs in a step - wise quantized manner .",
    "similar observations have been made using molecular dynamics simulations of ig - like domain @xcite .    despite the large variability in the stretch times",
    "@xmath35 the mechanism of approaching the rod - like conformation may be qualitatively described as occurring in roughly three stages . on the time scale @xmath72 following the application of a sudden force",
    "there is a loss of a number of native contacts .",
    "there is a concomitant increase in the extension of the chain @xmath73 , where @xmath74 . in the second stage , the sequence searches for the equilibrium rod - like conformation .",
    "there is great variation in the time scale for this search .",
    "this stage is characterized by one or several plateaus in @xmath69 ( see fig .",
    "finally , the chain explosively and cooperatively makes a transition to the rod state with @xmath75 .",
    "naturally , there are several exceptions to this generic scenario .",
    "for example , curve ( d ) in fig .",
    "( 2a ) shows that @xmath69 reaches its equilibrium value monotonically in an extremely short time .",
    "the dependence of the unfolding mechanisms on topology is illustrated by computing the dynamical evolution of all the topologically permissible contacts .",
    "we describe the results for two 27-mers rb two - state folders labeled a and b ( these are the sequences 61 and 63 , respectively in @xcite ) .",
    "the native state of each sequence is maximally compact .",
    "however , the key topological distinction between them is that in the native conformation for a the terminal beads are on the same facet of the cube , whereas for b they are placed directly on opposite facets . by tracking the time evolution of the loss of the 156 topological contacts , of which 28 are native , we computed the breaking times @xmath76 for contact @xmath77 .",
    "the times @xmath76 are determined by @xmath78 which measures how close the contact @xmath77 , formed between beads @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is to the sequence ends . for sequence",
    "a , we find that the time scales for the rupture of contacts are similar for groups of contacts that are close to one or the other end of the sequence .",
    "in contrast , for sequence b the disruption of contacts from the amino terminus ( bead 1 ) occurs fast , while the contacts located near the carboxyl terminus break up later in the unfolding process .",
    "thus , topology determines details of the force - induced unfolding pathways . since in ig - like",
    "domain the amino and carboxy termini are at opposite ends we expect that the underlying mechanism by which this domain unfolds may be similar to that for sequence b.    in fig .",
    "( 3a ) we present the force - induced unfolding rate @xmath39 as a function of @xmath0 for the 36-mer at @xmath79 . qualitatively similar results were obtained for the 27-mers as well .",
    "the unfolding rates were computed from the distribution of stretch times for 800 trajectories .",
    "it is expected that @xmath39 should increase upon increasing @xmath0 because the activation free energy is lowered upon application of force @xcite .",
    "the free energy profiles as a function of the number of native contacts ( @xmath80 ) , which is an approximate reaction coordinate for two - state folders @xcite , are given in fig .",
    "( 3b ) for the 36-mer at various force values .",
    "the decrease in the unfolding barrier explains the observed dependence of @xmath39 on @xmath0 for @xmath81 .",
    "the unfolding rate is well described by @xmath82 for @xmath83 which is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the unfolding free energy barrier at @xmath86 and zero force , @xmath87 is an approximate width of the unfolding potential , and @xmath88 is the unfolding rate in the absence of force . for the 36-mer @xmath89",
    "is 2.26 at @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "( 3b ) ) , @xmath90 and therefore @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the contour length of the chain .",
    "the small value of @xmath87 implies that the transition region is quite narrow .",
    "when @xmath93 the unfolding rate starts to decrease because sudden ( corresponding to large pulling speed ) application of relatively large forces traps the polypeptide chain in conformations , whose unfolding requires transient shortening of the end - to - end distance .",
    "the transition from such conformations , which requires local annealing of the chain , slows down the unfolding process . for @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "( 3a ) ) there is a free energy barrier associated with the breakup of contacts in the conformations acting as transient kinetic traps . in this force regime the fraction of molecules that are folded at a time @xmath37 is best fit using a sum of two exponentials with the slow phase signaling the onset of local trapping .",
    "our results for unfolding triggered by force are consistent with a number of experimental observations on the unraveling of isolated ig - like domains in titin @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) the ratio of @xmath95 for ig - like domains can be computed using eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) with @xmath96 , the folding temperature @xmath97 @xcite , and @xmath98 .",
    "this gives @xmath99 . from the phase diagram in fig .",
    "( 1a ) we obtain a similar value for the 36-mer when the temperature ( measured in kelvin ) is approximately @xmath100 .",
    "thus the general shape of the phase boundary should be useful in calibrating the experimental measurements on proteins .",
    "( 2 ) the typical values of the threshold force @xmath55 required to induce stretching in the two - state folders are in the range of @xmath101 . by translating these into physical units we obtain @xmath102 . using this",
    "we would predict that the unfolding force @xmath103 , which depends on the pulling speed , for ig - like domains in titin should be around @xmath104 .",
    "these values are not inconsistent with the experimental measurements ( see fig . ( 5 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "( 3 ) the width of the unfolding potential @xmath87 which is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ fopt ] ) and the computed values of @xmath105 and the activation free energy @xmath89 ( see fig . ( 3b ) ) in the absence of force for the 36-mer is @xmath106 .",
    "@xcite estimated that @xmath107 using @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "if we use the fact that the lattice constant @xmath11 , which gives the distance between @xmath57-carbon atoms , is @xmath110 then the value of @xmath87 for the 36-mer in physical units is roughly @xmath111 .",
    "these numbers are in very good accord with the experiments .",
    "the theoretical findings can be used to map the underlying folding free energy landscape for two - state proteins using data from force - induced unfolding experiments .",
    "this is illustrated by applying our results for the 36-mer to ig - like domains .",
    "an estimate of @xmath105 for ig domain can be made using the value of @xmath112 for the 36-mer , and by assuming that a @xmath105 scales linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "for the 90 residue ig - like domain we find that @xmath113 .",
    "the unfolding barrier is @xmath114 which is approximately @xmath115 assuming that @xmath108 @xcite . from the stability of ig domain ( @xmath116 @xcite )",
    "we predict that the refolding barrier is approximately @xmath117 . from these the folding and unfolding times",
    "are predicted to be @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",
    "these predictions are in fairly reasonable agreement with experimental estimates @xcite .",
    "the estimates of barriers to folding by force - induced unfolding measurements are likely to be complement to the standard method of measuring rates at finite denaturant concentration and then extrapolating to the desired values in the absence of denaturants .",
    "this study has led to the following predictions : ( i ) the unfolding time scales should decrease exponentially with force only till an optimum value of force , whose magnitude is determined by only the unfolding barrier in the absence of force .",
    "( ii ) the phase diagram , especially the boundary separating the unfolded and folded states , has the characteristic type seen in fig .",
    "( 1 ) and is quantitatively given by eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the nature of force - induced unfolding depends on the proximity of the amino and carboxy termini in the native state .",
    "these predictions are all amenable to experimental test .",
    "because the response to force depends sensitively on the characteristics of the sequence when @xmath0 is zero , it follows that the mechanisms of protein folding ( presence of intermediates , the nature of the transition states , and barriers to folding ) may be very directly probed by single molecule force spectroscopy .",
