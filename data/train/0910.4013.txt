    "giant arcs are spectacular examples of strong gravitational lensing found in rich galaxy clusters .",
    "background galaxies are stretched into long , thin arcs by the intense foreground gravitational field .",
    "hundreds of giant arcs have been found in both optically - selected and x - ray selected clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "massive clusters are efficient producer of giant arcs and the number of giant arcs is a good indicator of the abundance of massive clusters .",
    "the halo mass function is very sensitive to the cosmological parameters , especially at the massive end .",
    "moreover , the internal structures of massive clusters , such as substructures and ellipticity , also depend on the cosmological parameters .",
    "they all affect the lensing probability ( optical depth , e.g. , @xcite ) in various degree .",
    "therefore , the observation of giant arcs is a useful probe of the cosmological model , in particular the matter power - spectrum normalization , @xmath15 @xcite , the matter density , @xmath16 , and to a less extent the cosmological constant , @xmath17 .",
    "however , in order to use the observations of giant arcs to constrain the cosmological models , one has to thoroughly understand how the lensing probability is affected by the distribution of background source galaxies , as well as the intrinsic properties of lens population .",
    "it has been shown that the lensing probability increases significantly with the increase of the source redshift , thus it is necessary to quantify the redshift distribution of source galaxies in lensing studies @xcite .",
    "the lensing efficiency of massive clusters does not depend on the source size significantly @xcite , although not all the real source information has been used , in particular their shapes . @xcite",
    "first adopted realistic galaxy images with known photometric redshifts from the hubble deep field ( hdf ) as background sources .",
    "they selected clusters from a cosmological @xmath0-body simulation in a @xmath18 box at @xmath19 .",
    "the mass of the simulated lens clusters ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) is similar to that of 10 x - ray ",
    "selected clusters @xcite , the ( mean ) mass range of which is around @xmath22 .",
    "note that the mass is calculated based on the x - ray luminosity by using the @xmath23-@xmath24 relation @xcite .",
    "they argued that the probability of producing giant arcs is @xmath25 per cluster after observational effects are included , and emphasize that the number of giant arcs produced by the simulated clusters in their adopted cosmology ( with @xmath26 and the power - spectrum normalization of @xmath27 ) is consistent with the one observed in the massive clusters at redshift @xmath28 .    in this paper , we focus on the impact of background galaxy properties , rather than the properties of the lens clusters , on the efficiency of producing giant arcs .",
    "we use the cosmos data as direct input for the properties of background galaxies .",
    "we investigate how the strong lensing probabilities are affected by the shape , size , redshift distributions and clustering of background galaxies . instead of adopting all these source properties as a whole @xcite , we vary each of the source properties in turn to gain a clear understanding about their individual impacts on strong lensing statistics .",
    "the cosmos data has a substantial advantage over the hdf as it covers a much larger sky area ( its sky coverage is 1.6 square degrees vs. 5.3 square arcmins for the hdf ) as used in @xcite , and thus is less affected by the cosmic variance .",
    "while we confirm the effects of source redshift and size distributions , we find that the shape distribution of real galaxies has a dramatic effect on the lensing probability . with the cosmos images ,",
    "the lensing probability is boosted by a factor of @xmath29 relative to that based on simple assumptions of the shape distribution ( e.g. random ellipticity between 0 and 0.5 ) .",
    "our results indicate that the shape of galaxies is an important factor in matching the theoretical predictions and the observations of giant arcs .",
    "we will also show that clustering of background galaxies has a negligible effect on the lensing efficiency of producing giant arcs .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we discuss cosmos and background source population . in  3 , we discuss the simulation we use and our lensing methodology . in  4 ,",
    "we present our main results and compare with recent studies .",

    "the whole image in the @xmath7-band has been cut into @xmath32 edge - overlapped tiles of @xmath33 pixels of ccd , which are generated by rotating with an angle of @xmath34 degrees to the tile edge and embedded at the center of a rectangular box of @xmath35 pixels .",
    "the left area in the box is empty of galaxies .",
    "the galaxy images in the cosmos field are identified with the sextractor program @xcite .",

    "finally , a total of @xmath38 galaxies are identified .",
    "the output of sextractor contains the relative positions of sources in the tile and positions in the celestial equator coordinate system .",
    "the relative position is useful for identifying which galaxies are strongly lensed in the lensing process ( see  [ sec : tracing ] ) .",

    "in particular , we use the same shape analysis program as in search for giant - arcs ( see  [ sec : tracing ] ) to identify very elongated sources with the major - axis to minor - axis ratio @xmath39 in all the tiles and exclude them to avoid `` giant - arc like '' artifact sources ( e.g. imperfectly masked spikes due to ccd pixel overflow and asteroid trails ) or real sources which could have been lensed by foreground objects in cosmos field .",
    "all the cleaned cosmos tiles are added behind the lens clusters as source patches .",
    "the sky coverage of strong lensing simulation is the same as the original cosmos field . due to the magnitude limit of the photometric catalog",

    "tiles of @xmath43 pixels with white margin are placed randomly behind the lensing clusters in the lensing simulation , without specifically requiring that the lensing caustic area falls within the actual image .",

    "if so , we identify this grid point in the image plane as a lensed image pixel of that source galaxy ; if not , it is a trivial grid .",
    "all the highly magnified lensed image pixels ( e.g. , @xmath99 ) can be located .",
    "finally , we can obtain the whole image(s ) of a background galaxy by collecting all the image pixels of the same source using friends - of - friends ( fof ) method .",
    "for source slices at different redshifts , the high - magnification areas will be mapped into areas of different sizes in the sky .",
    "we choose a rectangular conjunctive angular area inclusive of every caustic area and put this angular box randomly in the source tile to select different background galaxies for the ray - tracing simulation .",
    "the box size is usually on the level of a few square arcmins ( depending on projection and also mass profile ) .",

    "since different giant arc surveys have different selection effects , the goal of this work is not only to compare our strong lensing efficiency with observations , but also to focus on using realistic , empirical information of background sources , and then to study how the lensing efficiency changes as we vary the assumptions .    for this purpose , we construct 7 comparison source samples in the control group which will be added in the ray - tracing simulations .",
    "all the samples are based on 100 randomly selected cosmos tiles .",

    "this is directly confirmed by two comparison samples , where we fix the effective diameters assigned to be @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we find a similar number of giant arcs ( 188 and 166 out of 3000 realizations ) , which is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : sdist ] . source size thus has a moderate effect on producing giant arcs when massive clusters are taken as lenses ( also see fig .",
    "[ fig : slw ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : lwsmap ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the typical source size is much smaller than the strong lensing caustic size , and thus a moderate change in the source size has a small impact on the number of giant arcs .      to see the overall impact of the simple assumptions for the shape , size , and redshift of background galaxies , we combine these effects to do lensing simulations ( for random position effect , see  [ sec : clustering ] ) .",
    "the redshift of all these sources is assigned to be 1.0 .",
    "the shape with a random orientation ( between 0 and @xmath134 ) are simulated as above , while the effective diameter is assigned to be @xmath141 .",
    "we find that the lensing efficiency for the case 3 ( `` z0s0e0 '' ) is a factor of 3.75 lower than that for case 1 ( `` z1s1e1 '' ) .",
    "it is roughly consistent with the results from the combination of the individual effects , i.e. redshift effect ( a factor of 1.15 which is got from comparing case 3 and 5 ) , shape effect ( a factor of 2.31 from case 4 and 5 ) and size effect ( a factor of 1.34 from case 5 and 6 ) , which is @xmath142 .",
    "it thus indicates that the galaxy shape , redshift and size are affecting strong lensing efficiency independently as well as these three properties are independent of each other intrinsically as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sz ] , [ fig : lwz ] and [ fig : slw ] .",
    "[ sec : clustering ]    theoretical calculations often assume that the background sources are randomly distributed in space .",
    "however , background galaxies are clearly clustered .",
    "it is therefore interesting to check the effect of source clustering on the incidence of giant arcs .",
    "the influence of the clustering effect is investigated by carrying out a ray - tracing simulation on a control sample of galaxies where the positions of original cosmos galaxies in a fiducial tile are randomly shuffled while keeping the source surface density , size and ellipticity unchanged .",
    "we find that the efficiency of producing giant arcs ( 166 giant arcs out of 3000 realizations for 10 clusters at @xmath117 ) is similar to what obtained in the cosmos case ( 163 giant arcs ) which implies the clustering effect of background sources is negligible on strong lensing .",
    "the likely reason is that the intrinsic source density is too low ( 43 per square arcmin ) and close pairs of sources are too few to form connected giant arcs or to be strongly lensed simultaneously .",
    "our results suggest that sources can be assumed to be random in the prediction of giant arcs , at least to the depth of cosmos ( in deeper images with a larger source density , clustering may become more important ) .",
    "[ sec : seeing ]    for our fiducial simulation ( case 1 ) , the observational data are taken by hst ( as in the hubble deep field used in horesh et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , many giant arcs were discovered from the ground - based telescopes where the effect of seeing may be important .",
    "a proper evaluation would require a detailed simulation of seeing effects .",
    "here we discuss briefly the approximate seeing effect on the predicted number of giant arcs .    in cosmos , there is a significant portion ( @xmath143 ) of small galaxies with the effective diameter @xmath144 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sdist ] ) .",
    "the width of lensed giant arcs produced from these small sources probably remains less than @xmath141 .",
    "in such cases , seeing ( such as @xmath145 ) will have a much larger effect on the width of giant arcs than on the length @xcite , and in general the @xmath118 ratio will be substantially reduced .",
    "assume the seeing is @xmath146 , the width of arcs intrinsically smaller than @xmath147 will be blurred to @xmath146 which we adopt as the `` observed '' width .",
    "we find that in this case the fraction of giant arcs of @xmath148 will be reduced to @xmath149 of the cosmos value .",
    "if seeing is as bad as @xmath141 , the lensing probability could be reduced to about @xmath150 of the original value .",
    "although this is only an approximate estimation , it is clear that the impact of seeing should be carefully evaluated in a detailed comparison between theoretical predictions and ground - based giant - arc surveys .",
    "[ sec : le ]    the giant arcs in this work are selected by quantifying the ratio of length to width ( @xmath151 ) . the definition of l / w in this paper is the same as that in @xcite . as a mock strong lensing survey",
    ", we have done 172500 realizations of ray - tracing simulations for all the 10 lens clusters at @xmath9 or @xmath117 with 575 galaxy tiles , and find that the lensing efficiency is about @xmath152 arcs for clusters at @xmath9 and @xmath153 arcs for clusters at @xmath117 per realization .    on the face value , they are much lower than the expected mean probability of @xmath25 giant arc per realization ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , they adopted galaxy images in the hubble deep field whose source density is about 12 times higher ( 1378/5.3=260 @xmath154 in hdf , vs. 23 @xmath155 in our case ) .",
    "the lensing efficiency with the surface density normalized is 0.840 arcs and 0.636 per realization , respectively .",
    "@xcite used a different definition of @xmath118 ratio which is smaller than ours by a factor of @xmath156 ( e.g. , their @xmath119 is equivalent to our @xmath157 ) , and thus our lensing efficiency ( of @xmath119 ) will be boosted by a factor of @xmath158 if we adopt their length - to - width ratio definition . taken these two factors into account",
    ", our clusters produce @xmath159 and @xmath160 giant arcs per realization for @xmath9 and 0.3 , respectively . in this exercise",
    ", we have assumed that the giant arc formation cross - section scales as the magnification probability distribution ( @xmath161 ) .",
    "therefore , the capability of our simulated lens clusters is in fact consistent with the observation , which is about 1.2 arcs per cluster found by @xcite using the sample in @xcite .",
    "the slight excess in the number counting could be induced by small number statistics and the relatively narrow mass range of the simulated lenses by contrast to the observational clusters .",
    "it also could be due to the different lens redshift distributions of the simulated ( @xmath56 ) and observational samples ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "in this paper , aiming to study the impacts of background sources on strong lensing statistics , we use the @xmath7-band galaxy image data of hst / acs in the cosmos to quantify the distributions of background source size , shape and redshift .",
    "each galaxy image is extracted by sextractor limiting a surface brightness down to @xmath163 .",
    "the redshift of each galaxy image is obtained by matching its celestial position with the cosmos photometric catalog .",
    "the selected sources are then lensed by 10 massive clusters of the mass range @xmath164 at @xmath1 and @xmath165 at @xmath166 as the lensing clusters chosen from a cosmological simulation in the @xmath72cdm cosmology ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "575 source tiles within the cosmos field of around 2 @xmath168 are fully used for the statistic study .",
    "172500 ray - tracing lensing simulations are carried out for 10 lens clusters to reduce the statistical fluctuation at the expected lens redshifts ( i.e. @xmath9 and 0.3 ) .",
    "the incidence of giant - arc production in our simulation is roughly consistent with that observed in @xcite , after the density difference is taken into account .",
    "the impacts of source size , shape and redshift on strong lensing statistics are investigated in detail .",
    "we find that the source size ( less than a factor of 1.5 ) and clustering only have small effects on the production of giant arcs .",
    "in contrast , the dependencies on the source redshift and ellipticity are much more significant .",
    "the first was highlighted by @xcite , while the second is the main new finding of the current work .",
    "we find that adopting the empirical ellipticity distribution of cosmos increases the lensing probability by a factor of 2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ze ] and also the number ratio between case 1 and 6 ) .",
    "the boosting effect of the ellipticity of the background galaxies has not been emphasized in the previous works .",
    "it should be included in theoretical modeling of giant arcs in future .",
    "this may also be of particular relevance for setting constraints on the power - spectrum normalization parameter @xmath15 .",
    "there are a number of limitations in the present work .",
    "when scaling our results with the source number density , we implicitly assume that other source properties ( like ellipticity and redshift ) are the same in cosmos as in a deeper observation ( like hdf ) .",
    "however , ellipticity distribution of galaxies in a deeper survey may turn out to be more elliptical ( @xcite ; see also the discussion on the surface brightness limit ) , which would increase the boosting factor of source ellipticity on strong lensing efficiency .",
    "we would also have a larger fraction of galaxies at the high redshift tail end in a galaxy survey like hdf , which increases the mean strong lensing cross section .",
    "therefore , both effects will produce more giant arcs . for direct comparison with observation , the observational effects , such as specific instrumental point - spread - function and observational seeing , are not fully included in our lensing simulations . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : seeing ] , if the seeing was @xmath141 , then there may be only around @xmath150 of giant arcs observed by a typical ground - based telescope compared with that by space - based one , such as hst .",
    "the same shape measurement method is used for quantifying the ellipticity of the original galaxies and lensed images .",
    "it could bring in some inaccuracy for measuring the ellipticity of very round images , since it is mainly designed for quantifying arcs .",
    "nevertheless , this effect is rather small and negligible to our results , since we mainly focus on the elliptical galaxies . besides",
    ", the intrinsic pixelization will affect the ellipticity quantification of small sources , especially for sources of @xmath169 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : slw ] ) .",
    "the influence of pixelization would probably shift down the measured ellipticity because of its relative larger effect on width measurement .",
    "since the number of such tiny sources is small ( @xmath170 ) and the pixelization does not significantly change the ellipticity value on average ( much smaller than the effect of seeing ) , this influence would not be important to our analysis .    according to @xcite ,",
    "cluster substructures are important for strong lensing efficiency in a major merger case , especially at the early state .",
    "as we adopt a softening length of 30 @xmath82 , the softening mainly takes effect in the center of major merging clumps , while it would also smooth away the small substructures of a similar scale in a minor merger case or those remaining in a main halo .",
    "the change of the lensing cross section due to this kind of smoothing would not be significant in both cases . besides , according to a comparison plot of optical depth in fig .",
    "4 of @xcite , the result agrees within @xmath171 of @xcite , in which they adopt a much smaller softening length of @xmath172 than 30 @xmath82 in our case , for a source redshift of @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , although the relatively large value of softening length could reduce the lensing efficiency , it would not affect our results significantly .",
    "moreover , lensing clusters are selected from a dark matter only simulation , therefore , we can not investigate the strong lensing dependence on source properties for clusters with realistic baryon distributions .",
    "we have only used one surface brightness limit ( e.g. , a detection threshold of 1.5 @xmath36 ) to extract the background galaxy images . since the redshift of galaxy",
    "is mainly constrained by the matching with photometric catalog , it will not change the distribution by using a higher detection threshold in our case .",
    "a variation of detection threshold would change the galaxy size , but the dependence of lensing efficiency on source size is weak ( see  [ sec : sourcesize ] ) , thus the main results should remain unchanged .",
    "the source shape distribution also depends on the surface brightness threshold .",
    "indeed , at a lower surface brightness limit , the shape of the galaxies tends to more elliptical @xcite .",
    "thus at fainter surface brightness , the shape influence is expected to play a more important role on giant - arc production for the same lens cluster population .",
    "it is meaningful to do ray - tracing experiments by using several surface brightness limits to quantify the shape impact on strong lensing in different survey depths .",
    "the different mass range of the simulated clusters and x - ray selected ones could bring in quantitative uncertainties in the giant - arc statistics , since the strong lensing cross section strongly depend on mass , e.g. , the mean cross section changes by nearly 4 orders of magnitude over mass ranging from @xmath173 @xmath174 to @xmath175 @xmath174 in fig .  7 of @xcite . however , the mean cross section ratio is less than 1.5 between the observed and our simulated clusters , according to the plot .",
    "moreover , they use a larger mass density parameter @xmath176 and a higher matter power - spectrum normalization @xmath177 in their simulation .",
    "besides , the simulated clusters are put at a much higher redshift @xmath178 .",
    "all these effects help to make the mass dependence of lensing probability stronger .",
    "therefore , the difference of mean cross section in two comparing samples would be much less than a factor of 1.5 and becomes negligible in this work .",
    "nevertheless , it is still necessary and interesting to select more comparable ( between the simulated and x - ray selected ) lens cluster samples in mass and redshift range for a fair comparison of giant - arc producing efficiency in the future .",
