    "in this paper we continue our investigation of dynamical response properties of quantum systems . in papers @xcite",
    ", we introduced _ response transformation _ of quantum kinematics . in paper",
    "@xcite , response transformation was extended to the key technical tool of quantum field theory ( qft ) , wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "the next step is to apply it to the standard perturbative techniques of qft @xcite . as a practically important example we consider electromagnetic interactions of light and matter .",
    "papers @xcite were intended predominantly for the quantum - optical community ; our goal was in particular to `` market '' qft methods to quantum opticians . here",
    "our goal is the opposite : we wish to apply wisdom acquired in quantum optics to qft .",
    "the result of this paper in a nutshell is that , firstly , _",
    "the nonequilibrium real - time qft is nothing but the nonlinear quantum response problem formulated in phase - space terms _ , and , secondly , that _ the most natural physical picture emerges if using the phase - space mapping based on the so - called time - normal operator ordering",
    "moreover , in relativistic quantum electrodynamics  ( qed ) , mappings based on other orderings ( e.g. , the keldysh rotation @xcite ) lead to inconsistencies , due to one s well - known inability to impose the lorentz condition on the operator of the electromagnetic  potential . imposing this condition on quantum states of the electromagnetic  field @xcite",
    "is not sufficient to cancel unphysical contributions to its _ fluctuations _",
    ", except in the time - normally - ordered representation ( termed in @xcite response representation ) .",
    "both backgrounds ( real - time qft and phase - space techniques ) are well covered in the literature .",
    "relatively recent review articles on the real - time qft are those of kamenev and levchenko @xcite and rammer and smith @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "an excellent introduction into the topic remains kadanoff - baym s classic @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the so - called thermofield dynamics , with emphasis on the relation between real - time and imaginary - time ( matsubara s @xcite ) techniques , is summarised in monographs of le bellac @xcite and umezawa , matsumoto and tachiki @xcite .",
    "a covariant formulation was introduced by niemi and semenoff @xcite .",
    "functional techniques was employed in @xcite .",
    "the dyson equation for the retarded propagator was derived , e.g. , by aurenche and becherrawy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a general introduction to phase - space concepts may be found in the monograph of mandel and wolf @xcite ; for a discussion concentrated on the symmetric ( weyl s ) operator ordering see the text @xcite .",
    "the connection between the closed - time - loop formulation and weyl s ordering has been made by a number of authors , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "an attempt to apply methods of real - time qft to quantum optics was made by vinogradov and stenholm @xcite .",
    "generalisation of the conventional time - normal operator ordering @xcite beyond the resonance approximation , making it applicable in relativity , was introduced in @xcite for bosons and @xcite for fermions .",
    "conventional real - time qft relies on the _ closed - time - loop  formulation _ @xcite as a general framework , the _ keldysh rotation _ @xcite as means of introducing space - time field propagation , and _",
    "dyson equations _ for relevant green functions solved under suitable approximations as a computational tool .",
    "this schedule is adhered to more or less closely in more recent publications @xcite , but may be only implicit in older ones @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we also adhere to this schedule so far as the closed - time - loop  techniques and dyson equations are concerned , while revising the keldysh rotation .",
    "the key observation is that the latter may be alternatively defined as a _ phase - space mapping _",
    "based on the symmetric , or weyl s , ordering of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "an extension of the keldysh rotation to a class of generalised rotations associated with a class of operator orderings then suggests itself .",
    "this class contains , in particular , the conventional keldysh rotation which is a mapping based on the symmetric ordering , and the _ response transformation _ of the closed - time - loop  techniques @xcite , which is a generalised rotation ( mapping ) based on the normal ordering @xcite .",
    "the normal ordering is the ordering of choice for quantisation of free fields @xcite , because it warrants zero quantum numbers of vacuum ( energy , momentum , etc . ) .",
    "one may say that it warrants an empty quantum vacuum free of `` zero - point fluctuations '' , analogous to vacua of classical theories @xcite .",
    "response transformation , which is a generalisation of the normal ordering from free to heisenberg  operators , extends this special property of the normal ordering to interacting fields .",
    "a word of caution is in place here .",
    "since an ordering applied to a single operator leaves this operator intact , everything associated with the average field does not depend on the ordering .",
    "in particular , formulae for linear ( kubo s ) and nonlinear response functions are shared by all generalised keldysh rotations .",
    "the difference is only in the definition of quantum noise of interacting systems .",
    "_ under the response transformation , zero - point fluctuations do not contribute to the quantum noise .",
    "_ verification of this statement as a general theorem will be a subject of forthcoming papers . here ,",
    "we confine our attention to a ( relatively ) simple example : interaction of quantised electromagnetic  field with the dirac vacuum in the first nonvanishing order of perturbation theory .",
    "we show that response transformation maps this quantum problem one - to - one to a semiclassical problem of propagation of a classical ( c - number ) field in a quantum medium .",
    "the dirac vacuum enters the theory _ only _ through its linear response ( linear susceptibility ) .",
    "zero - point fluctuations in the dirac vacuum are eliminated .",
    "this `` simple example '' involves divergences and renormalizations , allowing us to demonstrate that these concepts are consistent with both the semiclassical viewpoint and the response transformation .",
    "a clear advantage is the possibility to isolate , through `` tuned '' regularizations , a self - contained physical `` subtheory '' without divergences .",
    "papers of the present authors @xcite aside , the only work we are aware of , that can be seen as a predecessor of this investigation , is the article of aurenche and becherrawy @xcite .",
    "these authors replace the keldysh rotation by diagonalisation of the matrix propagator .",
    "our approach differs from that of aurenche and becherrawy by its phase - space origins , by the emphasis on response , operator orderings and classical connotations , and by the use of one retarded propagator rather than a retarded - advanced pair .",
    "nonetheless similarities between this paper and @xcite are striking .",
    "both look at restructuring of the keldysh series following redefinition of the propagator , with emergence of new types of vertices .",
    "one also finds separation of the frequency - positive and frequency - negative  parts as a technical tool , cf .",
    "( a3 ) , ( a4 ) in appendix a in @xcite .",
    "however , different models ( spinor qed here _ versus _ scalar field theories with self - action in @xcite ) make direct comparison of our results to @xcite somewhat difficult .",
    "such comparison will be a subject of a separate paper .",
    "the present paper comprises three logical parts , which are in turn split between the main body and the appendices .",
    "the first part ( [ch : tx ] and appendices [ ch : os ] , [ ch : t ] ) deals with the formal techniques .",
    "here we establish the connection of our approach with the real - time qft , and generalise results of papers @xcite beyond the time - normal operator ordering .",
    "we start from a brief summary in . in , we establish the connection between orderings of free - field operators and generalised keldysh rotations .",
    "in , generalised keldysh rotations and the corresponding operator orderings are introduced for interacting fields . in appendices [ ch : os ] and [ ch : t ] , analyses of and [ ch : tx ] are generalised beyond gaussian systems .",
    "general implications of our analyses are the subject of the second part of the paper ( [ch : m ] and appendix [ ch : zzz ] ) . in , we define `` quantum noise '' of quantised fields , and discuss its classical connotations .",
    "the latter are put to use in , where the key dynamical results of the paper are formulated in a conjectural way , following the analogy between classical stochasticity and `` quantum noise '' in response representation .",
    "verification of conjectures of , which involves tedious analyses of diagrammatic structures , is the subject of appendix [ ch : zzz ] .    in the third part of the paper ( and appendices [ ch : fab ] , [ ch : o ] ) , we concern ourselves with the `` simple example''quantised electromagnetic field in the dirac sea .",
    "we calculate the linear susceptibility of the dirac vacuum , including the unavoidable renormalisation , and show consistency of our results with more traditional approaches .",
    "we also calculate the `` quantum noise '' of the electromagnetic field , and show that in the time - normal representation it vanishes , while an attempt to use other orderings leads to inconsistencies . in appendix",
    "[ ch : fab ] , we touch upon the choice of signs and dimensional factors in formulae ( we use si units ) , and rederive response transformations of green functions of free fields by conventional qft means ( integrals in the complex plane of energy ) .",
    "appendix [ ch : o ] outlines details of the calculations omitted in .",
    "we assume familiarity of the reader with basics of phase - space and closed - time - loop  techniques , including the concepts of symmetric ( weyl s ) , time and reverse - time orderings @xcite .",
    "these orderings are denoted as , and , respectively ( the orderings are often denoted and ) . for formal definitions",

    ", one defines the kernels , @xmath0where the averaging is over the heisenberg  state of the field .",

    "the key formal observation is that , in the interaction picture , the anticommutator coincides with the symmetrically ( weyl ) ordered product of free - field operators , @xmath3this relation is nontrivial , because weyl s ordering is defined not for field operators , but for the underlying creation and annihilation operators .    equation ( [ eq:13ah ] ) raises two questions :    * can one define generalised keldysh rotations with other types of ordering of the creation and annihilation operators  in place of weyl s one ?",
    "for instance , with the normal ordering ?",
    "can generalised keldysh rotations be extended to heisenberg  operators ? * what are the properties of emerging representations of qft ?",
    "the answer to the first question is unqualified `` yes '' . to the second question we provide two partial answers :    * response transformation analysed in @xcite is a generalised keldysh rotation related to the normal ordering .",
    "its structural properties , in particular , the association with the response problem and causality , extend to all generalised keldysh rotations .",
    "* within the simple model mentioned in the introduction , the special property of the response transformation is elimination of zero - point fluctuations from quantum dynamics .",
    "the rest remains subject to further work .",
    "here we summarize definitions of the time and closed - time - loop operator orderings , using this opportunity to introduce notation .",
    "let be arbitrary bosonic operators , and .",
    "then , @xmath4this definition is extended to arbitrary time sequences assuming that bosonic operators commute under the orderings .",

    "double time - ordered _ structure , @xmath6rather than visually keeping the operators under the @xmath7-orderings , one marks the operators with the @xmath8 indices and allows them to commute freely .",
    "these indices serve only for ordering purposes and otherwise should be disregarded .",
    "note that we put the c - contour indices into subscripts ( unlike , e.g. , kamenev and levchenko @xcite ) , because superscripts are reserved for other purposes .      for simplicity , consider an harmonic oscillator with frequency , equipped with the standard bosonic creation / annihilation pair , @xmath9 = 1 .",

    "<S> structural properties of the response transformation , such as its association with the nonlinear quantum response problem and the related causality properties , hold for all generalised keldysh rotations .    furthermore , we argue that response transformation is especially suited for rtqft formulation of spatial , in particular , relativistic , problems , because it extends cancellation of zero - point fluctuations , characteristic of the normal ordering , to interacting fields . as an example , we consider quantised electromagnetic  field in the dirac sea . in the time - normally - ordered representation , </S>",
    "<S> dynamics of the field looks essentially classical ( fields radiated by currents ) , without any contribution from zero - point fluctuations . for comparison , we calculate zero - point fluctuations of the interacting electromagnetic  field under orderings other than time - normal . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting expression is physically inconsistent : it does not obey the lorentz condition , nor maxwell s equations .    </S>",
