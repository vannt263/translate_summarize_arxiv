    "fluids adsorbed near wedges , cones and corners show filling phenomena @xcite similar to the wetting of planar wall - fluid and fluid - fluid interfaces @xcite . above a filling temperature @xmath1",
    "a wedge ( say ) in contact with vapour at bulk coexistence is completely filled by liquid , analogous to the complete wetting of a planar wall - fluid interface above the wetting temperature @xmath2 .",
    "there are , however a number of notable distinctions between wetting and the different possible types of filling transition .",
    "firstly , thermodynamic arguments @xcite dictate that filling precedes wetting , occurring when the contact angle satisfies @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wedge tilt angle ( see ) . thus filling",
    "may occur in the absence of any wetting transition i.e. if the walls are partially wet up to the bulk critical temperature .",
    "secondly the conditions for observing continuous ( critical ) filling @xcite in the laboratory are much less restrictive than for continuous ( critical ) wetting @xcite .",
    "for example 3d cone or corner filling should be continuous provided the line - tension is negative .",
    "finally , the critical singularities and fluctuation effects occurring at critical filling reflect the divergence of different length - scales compared to wetting .",
    "for example , in a 3d wedge , long - wavelength fluctuations in the interfacial height along the wedge dominate and lead to an interfacial roughness that is much larger than for wetting at a planar wall and which exhibits universal properties@xcite .    for 2d wedges ( and 3d cones ) on the other hand something quite different and unexpected occurs .",
    "recent studies based on effective interfacial hamiltonians @xcite and more microscopic ising models @xcite indicate that there is a fundamental connection with the strong - fluctuation ( sfl ) regime of critical wetting @xcite . more specifically ,",
    "even in the presence of long - ranged forces , the divergence of the interfacial height at critical filling together with the precise scaling form of the mid - point interfacial height probability distribution function ( pdf ) are identical to predictions for the critical wetting sfl regime . in other words",
    "the substrate geometry effectively turns off the influence of long - ranged solid - fluid and fluid - fluid forces so the fluid mimics fluctuation behaviour predicted for planar systems with short - ranged forces . in 2d",
    "this has been demonstrated for both pure and impure systems ( with random - bond disorder ) and can be precisely expressed in terms of special wedge covariance laws which relate the interfacial heights and pdf s in the different geometries at bulk two - phase coexistence @xcite . whilst the demonstration of these laws , particularly for impure systems , is rather technical , the final expressions are extremely simple and contain a great deal of information . consider a fluctuation - dominated filling transition occurring in a 2d wedge and let @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the equilibrium mid - point interfacial height and corresponding pdf respectively .",
    "now let @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the interfacial height and pdf for a sfl regime wetting transition , occurring at @xmath9 wall - fluid interface , written in terms of the contact angle .",
    "covariance for the interfacial heights implies that at bulk coexistence and as @xmath10 , @xmath11 the statement of covariance for the pdf s is even stronger : @xmath12 implying that not only the interfacial height but also the roughness ( and all moments of the distribution ) at filling and wetting are similarly related .",
    "in this paper we further investigate the connection between filling and wetting and demonstrate covariance relations for other quantities of interest .",
    "again , because the derivation of these results is rather technical we quote their final form here . for the excess free energy of the wedge @xmath13 at coexistence we find that for both pure and impure systems @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the point tension near a sfl regime critical wetting transition .",
    "we also consider the local compressibility for filling @xmath16 corresponding to the derivative of the mid - point density profile w.r.t .",
    "chemical potential @xmath17 evaluated at two - phase coexistence .",
    "this is related to the corresponding expression @xmath18 for sfl regime wetting by @xmath19    these covariance relations complement the standard scaling hypothesis for the singular contribution to the corner free - energy and may be understood heuristically by considering the special influence that the wedge ( and also cone ) geometry has on interfacial configurations .",
    "the relations are rather restrictive and from them we may deduce the allowed values of the critical exponents for both 2d filling @xmath20 critical wetting transitions without explicit model calculations .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to the restrictions imposed by the principle of conformal invariance for bulk and surface critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "we will also use the covariance relations to derive new results for the point tension and position dependence of the local compressibility .",
    "indeed for the point tension we will be able to derive a conjectured critical exponent relation due to indekeu and robledo @xcite and also explain why , for pure systems , the point tension shows a logarithmic singularity as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "our article is arranged as follows : in  ii we present the necessary background theory for critical wetting describing , in turn , the derivation of critical exponent relations and fluctuation regimes from heuristic scaling theory and the scaling of the density profile , probability distribution function and their short - distance expansions . in ",
    "iii we discuss the singularities of the point tension first recalling the hyper - scaling conjecture of indekeu and robledo @xcite and exact ising model results for pure systems due to abraham , latrmolire and upton @xcite .",
    "we then present a lengthy calculation of the point tension @xmath22 for critical wetting in pure and impure systems systems using continuum interfacial models . as far as we are aware",
    "@xmath22 has not been calculated before for systems with random - bond disorder and the derived expression shows singular behaviour as @xmath21 in full agreement with the indekeu - robledo conjecture . in  iv we begin our discussion of 2d filling transitions and first discuss critical exponent relations , heuristic fluctuation theory and the scaling of the density profile and pdf , which parallels our earlier discussion of critical wetting . in ",
    "v we recall the main results of explicit effective hamiltonian studies of filling which will be further developed here .",
    "these calculations support the scaling theory developed in ",
    "iv and also demonstrate the covariance laws ( [ law01])-([law03 ] ) quoted above .",
    "the consequences of these relations and the restrictions they place on the allowed values of the critical exponents at 2d filling and wetting ( in systems with short - ranged forces ) are discussed at length . a new and very simple result for the point tension",
    "is also discussed from which we can derive the indekeu - robledo exponent relation . in ",
    "vi we turn our attention to scaling behaviour occurring off bulk coexistence and focus on the position dependence of the local compressibility leading to the final covariance relation ( [ law04 ] ) .",
    "finally we revisit the nature of filling and wetting in pure systems and use the covariance relations to re - derive the specific results of the transfer matrix studies .",
    "we finish our article with a brief summary of our main results and discussion of future work .",
    "we begin with a brief survey of the central results from the theory of critical wetting paying special attention to critical exponents , fluctuation regimes , and the scaling of the density profile and pdf .",
    "further details and original references can be found in the excellent review articles @xcite .",
    "consider the interface between a planar substrate ( wall ) , located in the @xmath23 plane , and a bulk fluid phase at temperature @xmath24 and chemical potential @xmath17 ( and corresponding pressure @xmath25 ) .",
    "the two - phase coexistence line is denoted @xmath26 with corresponding bulk liquid and vapour phases densities , @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively . throughout this article",
    "we set @xmath29 for convenience .",
    "we suppose the wall - vapour interface preferentially adsorbs the liquid phase and is completely wet above a wetting transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "thus the wetting phase boundary is defined by the vanishing of the contact angle @xmath30 the wetting transition corresponds to a singularity in the excess free - energy ( surface tension ) of the planar wall - vapour interface @xmath31 .",
    "this is defined @xcite by subtracting the bulk contribution from the total grand potential @xmath32 @xmath33 in the limit of infinite volume v and planar area a. on approaching a critical wetting transition the adsorption @xmath34 with @xmath35 the equilibrium height of the liquid - vapour interface above the wall , diverges continuously .",
    "the critical wetting transition has two relevant scaling fields which we can identify ( for fixed strength of the wall - fluid intermolecular potential ) as @xmath36 and @xmath37 . from scaling theory",
    "we anticipate that off two phase coexistence @xmath31 contains a singular term , @xmath38 which vanishes at the critical wetting phase boundary and can be written @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 are the surface specific heat and gap exponents respectively , @xmath42 is the scaling function and we have restricted our attention to @xmath43 .",
    "now at coexistence we have , by definition @xmath44 so that from young s equation @xcite it follows that the contact angle vanishes as @xmath45 and can be used as an alternative measure of the temperature - like scaling field .",
    "in addition to the mean interface height @xmath35 we also need consider the divergence of the r.m.s interfacial width or roughness @xmath46 and the transverse correlation length @xmath47 measuring the correlations in fluctuations of the interfacial height along the wall . at @xmath48 , the divergence of these length - scales",
    "is characterised by critical exponents defined by @xmath49 and we expect scaling behaviour similar to ( [ freeenergywetting ] ) off coexistence . thus , along the wetting critical isotherm ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) we define @xmath52 and anticipate that the critical exponent @xmath53 .",
    "critical exponent relations immediately follow from the scaling hypothesis .",
    "firstly from the gibbs adsorption equation @xcite @xmath54 we have @xmath55 which identifies the gap exponent . secondly , from the compressibility sum - rule",
    "( see for example @xcite ) @xmath56 we have @xmath57 so that on eliminating the gap exponent we arrive at the important relation @xmath58 which is valid for all dimensions , ranges of forces and fluctuation regimes of interest .",
    "the perpendicular and transverse correlation lengths are related through the wandering exponent defined by @xcite @xmath59 with the value of @xmath60 dependent on the dimensionality and qualitative type of disorder . for discussions of wetting and filling in 2d systems the most relevant values are @xmath61 and @xmath62 for pure ( thermal disorder ) and impure systems ( random - bond disorder ) respectively . recall that random - fields destroy phase coexistence in two dimensions so can not be considered . also whilst values of the wandering exponent @xmath63",
    "have been predicted for some models of interfacial roughening transitions in quasi - crystalline materials this is not of particular importance to the general fluctuation theory of wetting ( and filling ) and will not be considered here .",
    "the predictions we make for the values of critical exponents at filling will assume that in 2d , @xmath64 .",
    "quite generally , provided @xmath65 , the critical singularities at wetting are believed to fall into @xmath66 distinct classes depending on the interplay between interfacial wandering and the ` direct ' influence of intermolecular forces @xcite .",
    "the latter can be modelled by the binding potential @xmath67 with @xmath68 effective hamaker constants and indices @xmath69 depending on the range of the intermolecular forces .",
    "the binding potential describes the bare or mean - field wetting transition and in order for this to be continuous we require that @xmath70 at the ( mean - field ) phase boundary .",
    "thus @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the mean - field wetting temperature .",
    "the existence of three regimes can be understood semi - quantitatively @xcite by comparing the bare binding potential with an effective fluctuation contribution @xmath73 the form of which is suggested by interfacial hamiltonian models . beyond mean - field level",
    "we anticipate large scale fluctuation effects with @xmath74 and thus using ( [ wandering ] ) one can estimate @xmath75 implying that @xmath76 . the competition between @xmath77 and",
    "the bare potential leads to the following three fluctuation regimes    * * mean field ( mf ) regime * - if @xmath78 fluctuation effects are negligible , @xmath79 and the mean - interface position remains close to the minimum of the binding potential .",
    "the phase boundary remains @xmath80 with @xmath81 . * * weak fluctuation ( wfl ) regime * - if @xmath82 but @xmath83 the repulsion from the wall has an entropic origin but the attraction is still due to long - ranged forces . in this regime",
    "the phase boundary remains @xmath80 with @xmath84 with large - scale interfacial fluctuations @xmath74 .",
    "* * strong fluctuation ( sfl ) regime * - if @xmath85 , fluctuations dominate leading to a renormalisation of the phase boundary and universal critical behaviour .",
    "because the wetting phase boundary no longer occurs at @xmath80 one can not use the above heuristic argument to determine the values of the critical exponents .",
    "however a remarkable feature of 2d wetting is that the values of the sfl regime critical exponents can be explicitly related to the wandering exponent @xmath0 using very general random walk arguments @xcite . for wetting in systems with @xmath86",
    "the full set of values for the critical exponents is @xmath87 and @xmath88 which are in precise agreement with the explicit results of ising model @xcite and effective interfacial hamiltonian studies @xcite .",
    "the values of these critical exponents will play a central role in our discussion of 2d filling .",
    "finally we point out that in both the wfl and sfl regime , where @xmath74 the divergence of the interfacial height , at @xmath48 , written in terms of the contact angle , @xmath89 is characterised by a universal critical exponent @xmath90 which follows directly from the critical exponent relation ( [ rush ] ) @xmath91 using the explicit values of the critical exponents ( [ wflb]),([sfl1 ] ) .",
    "we shall return to this later when we use the covariance relations to determine the values of the critical exponents at 2d filling .",
    "the position dependence of the equilibrium density profile , @xmath92 , local response functions such as the compressibility / susceptibility @xmath93 and also higher - point functions all show scaling behaviour in the wfl and sfl scaling regimes .",
    "the scaling emerges in the appropriate limits @xmath94 with @xmath95 arbitrary and for the profile we anticipate @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the scaling function satisfying @xmath98 , @xmath99 and which is distinct in the sfl and wfl regimes .",
    "clearly the scaling of @xmath92 does not include oscillatory structure close to the wall or effects associated with bulk and surface criticality but rather reflects the large scale fluctuations of the unbinding liquid - vapour interface . for large @xmath100 but",
    "@xmath101 the profile has a characteristic algebraic short - distance expansion ( sde ) @xcite @xmath102 where , for simplicity we have set @xmath48 .",
    "the sde critical exponent @xmath103 ( referred to as @xmath104 in earlier work ) also describes the behaviour of the local compressibility and pair - correlation functions close to the wall .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath103 is not independent , and can be related to others using standard surface maxwell conditions and sum - rules .",
    "importantly it takes different universal values in the sfl and wfl regimes and can be identified as @xcite @xmath105 and @xmath106 which are valid for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the scaling of the profile is directly related to the scaling of the interfacial height pdf , @xmath107 , since interfacial fluctuations dominate the distribution of matter and we may write @xmath108 where we have assumed the interface separates regions of bulk vapour and liquid density and we have omitted the field dependence of the pdf . throughout this paper",
    "we shall omit the field dependence whenever the equation containing it is exact within effective hamiltonian theory and not just restricted to the asymptotic critical regime . since the contact angle @xmath104 is an equivalent ( possibly non - linear ) measure of the temperature - like scaling field @xmath109 it is possible to write the scaling dependence as @xmath110 rather than @xmath111 .",
    "moreover for the next few sections we concentrate on behaviour occurring at @xmath48 and define @xmath112 . scaling then implies that in the wfl and sfl regimes @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the scaling function and @xmath115 is a suitable metric factor having dimensions of inverse length .",
    "this may be chosen so that the argument of the scaling function is equivalent to the length - scales ratio @xmath116 .",
    "notice that the power - law dependence of the contact angle follows from ( [ weak ] ) and is the same in the wfl and sfl regimes .",
    "the different fluctuation effects occurring in these regimes are distinguished by the appropriate scaling functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "both functions are similar at large distances where , out of the range of the binding potential , they decay exponentially quickly but have quite distinct short - distance expansions @xmath119 describing the limit @xmath120 . using the appropriate values for the critical exponents in 2d it can be seen that , for both pure and impure systems , the interface makes many more excursions to the wall in the sfl regime than in the wfl regime .",
    "hereafter we will only need to deal with the properties of the sfl regime .",
    "the explicit results of effective interfacial hamiltonian studies are completely consistent with the scaling predictions and sde . for pure systems with just thermal disorder",
    "the pdf in the sfl regime is particularly simple @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath122 denotes the stiffness coefficient of the unbinding interface and may be identified with @xmath123 for continuum , fluid - like systems for which the interface is isotropic . for random bond disorder",
    "the expression for @xmath8 is considerably more complicated but can still be calculated analytically using replica trick methods@xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the inverse length - scale associated with the disorder ( see later ) .",
    "note that in both these expressions the respective combinations @xmath126 and @xmath127 , together with the sde s , are in agreement with the above scaling theory .",
    "the one ingredient missing in our review of fluctuation effects at 2d wetting is the nature of the point tension @xmath22 measuring the excess free - energy associated with the point of three - phase contact between wall - vapour and wall - liquid interfaces @xcite .",
    "the reason for this , as first pointed out by abraham , latrmolire and upton ( alu)@xcite , is that beyond mean - field level , fluctuation effects make the definition of @xmath22 a rather subtle issue .",
    "the purpose of this long section is to identify a method of defining @xmath22 within continuum effective interfacial hamiltonian theory that we can apply to the case of wetting with random - bond disorder . to begin recall that within mean - field theory , it is straight - forward to to define the point / line tension @xmath22 by simply subtracting the necessary bulk and interfacial contributions from the grand - potential of the heterogeneous wall - fluid interface @xcite .",
    "such studies reveal that as @xmath128 at @xmath48 , @xmath22 contains a singular contribution which we write @xmath129 with a point / line tension specific heat exponent @xmath130 which depends sensitively on the range of the forces .",
    "a crucial insight into the singularities of the point / line tension was made by indekeu and robledo @xcite who pointed out that within mean - field theory the singularities of @xmath22 were consistent with the hyper - scaling equation @xmath131 and conjectured that this is generally valid even in the presence of fluctuation effects .",
    "the indekeu - robledo conjecture is important because it relates the excess free - energy of a heterogeneous wall - fluid interface to the properties of a homogeneous wall - vapour interface . as we shall show there are very good reasons for regarding this as the precursor of a covariance relationship between filling and critical wetting .",
    "indeed , we shall be able to derive a precise relation for the point tension , valid for pure and impure systems , which is in perfect agreement with ( [ joseph1 ] ) .",
    "assuming the validity of the hyperscaling relation for the point tension in 2d we can identify , in the sfl regime @xmath132 which completes our list of critical wetting exponents .",
    "following our earlier discussion of the interfacial height and pdf it is convenient for later purposes to measure the singular contribution to the point tension as a function of the contact angle rather than @xmath109 .",
    "we will only consider the point tension for systems with short - ranged forces ( belonging to the sfl regime ) and thus expect @xmath133 with @xmath134 given by ( [ alphal ] ) in fact , as we shall show , for interfacial models with strictly short - ranged ( contact ) forces there is no ambiguity defining the point tension itself @xmath15 to be a function of @xmath104 , although , of course such models are only well - defined when @xmath104 is small .",
    "thus , for pure systems with @xmath61 , the indekeu - robledo hyper - scaling relation predicts @xmath135 which may either mean that @xmath22 remains finite at @xmath136 or diverges ( or vanishes ) more slowly than any power law . for random bonds however , the indekeu - robledo prediction is unambiguous : @xmath137 so that @xmath138 .",
    "these predictions are discussed in detail below .",
    "alu point out that , at least for two - dimensional systems , considerable care has to be taken in defining the point tension due to the influence of large scale interfacial wandering which smooths out the point of contact . in mean - field theories , which ignore fluctuation effects , there is no pathology involved in constructing boundary conditions which induce a line of contact between a wall - vapour interface and the edge of an infinite drop .",
    "however , this latter concept becomes ill - defined as soon as fluctuation effects are introduced since the surface of an infinite drop of liquid has unbounded fluctuations in the interfacial height . to overcome this problem alu",
    "propose a fluctuation theory - based definition of @xmath22 , involving a convolution of partition functions .",
    "this requires as input some appropriate choice for the partition function representing a finite - size liquid drop . in this way",
    "the thermodynamic limit can be taken yielding a well - defined point tension , although the expression obtained depends crucially on the choice of restricted partition function used to model the edge of the liquid drop .",
    "the most satisfactory definition shows the singular behaviour @xmath139 close to the wetting transition which is indeed consistent with the indekeu - robledo exponent relation .",
    "the other fluctuation definitions considered by alu yield point tensions that are either non - singular or have a different numerical pre - factor of the logarithm ( other than unity ) .",
    "however as pointed out by alu the above divergence is appealing since it coincides precisely with the singularity predicted by a heuristic energy - entropy balance argument . in an infinite ising strip of width @xmath140 lattice spacings and with opposing surface fields ( which we refer to as a @xmath141 strip )",
    ", it is well understood that pseudo - phase coexistence only occurs below the wetting temperature and for sufficiently large strip widths @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is characterised by an exponentially large correlation length ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) reflecting the asymptotic degeneracy of the lowest two transfer - matrix eigenvalues . physically",
    "this mean that the interface sticks to each wall over exponentially large distances which can be estimated by @xmath142 valid for large @xmath140 , small @xmath104 and @xmath143 . here",
    "@xmath144 is an appropriate ( non - singular ) length - scale for measuring distances along the strip which we anticipate is of the order of the bulk correlation length .",
    "this has to be introduced for dimensional reasons and plays no role in determining the divergence of @xmath22 near wetting .",
    "the argument of the exponential reflects the free - energy cost of an interface jump from one wall to the other with contributions arising from surface free - energies , leading to the @xmath145 term and two point tensions .",
    "exact evaluation of the correlation length in the @xmath141 ising model and also in solid - on - solid approximation ( valid at low temperatures away from the bulk critical point ) yields a point tension in precise agreement with result ( [ line2d ] ) from the alu convolution definition .",
    "the purpose of this subsection is to show that one may also obtain the logarithmic singularity of the point tension for pure systems from the asymptotic scaling of the pdf as evaluated using a continuum effective interfacial hamiltonian .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it can be readily generalised to systems with random - bond disorder , which we will consider next . to begin , we introduce the interfacial model and explicitly evaluate the point tension using the alu finite - size @xmath141 strip identification discussed above .",
    "the general fluctuation theory of wetting 2d in pure systems , without quenched impurities , is based on the interfacial model ( see @xcite and references therein ) @xmath146 = \\int dx \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\frac { dl}{dx } \\right)^2 + hl+w(l ) \\right\\ } \\label{effham}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 is the local height of the unbinding ( liquid - vapour ) at position @xmath148 along the wall and @xmath149 , @xmath122 are the binding potential and stiffness coefficient introduced earlier .",
    "we emphasise again that we will focus on isotropic bulk fluid systems and identify @xmath122 with the surface tension @xmath123 .",
    "the partition function @xmath150 of a interface of length @xmath151 with fixed end positions @xmath152,@xmath153 is expressed in spectral form using continuum transfer - matrix methods @xcite , @xmath154 where the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , labelled @xmath155 satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath156 thus in the thermodynamic limit @xmath157 the singular part to the free - energy is simply @xmath158 which , for @xmath48 and @xmath159 allows us to identify the contact angle @xmath160 here we have used young s equation in the small contact limit for which the interfacial model is valid .",
    "similarly the normalised interfacial height pdf and parallel correlation length follows as @xmath161 and @xmath162 respectively . for future reference we also define the matrix elements @xmath163 which will appear in the transfer matrix theory for the wedge geometry . as discussed by burkhardt @xcite ,",
    "the scaling form of the pdf at ( [ pdfthermal ] ) at @xmath48 characteristic of the sfl regime , together with the values of the critical exponents quoted earlier ( with @xmath61 ) , readily emerges from the transfer matrix formulism if , instead of the binding potential contribution to ( [ effham ] ) , one imposes the boundary condition on the wave - functions @xmath164 where , for pure systems , @xmath165 .",
    "specifically , the ground - state energy @xmath166 , contact angle @xmath167 and mean interfacial height @xmath168 .",
    "next consider the interfacial model of the finite width @xmath141 ising strip at bulk coexistence .",
    "since the system has short - ranged forces we can mimic the influence of the surface fields through the boundary conditions @xmath169 for @xmath170 and large @xmath140 the first two eigenfunctions are @xmath171 and @xmath172 using the boundary conditions ( [ b2 ] ) we find for @xmath173 @xmath174 and @xmath175 writing these in terms of the contact angle of the semi - infinite geometry we arrive at the desired expression for the parallel correlation length @xmath176 from this we can now extract the desired result for the point tension in the interfacial model using the alu identification ( [ expo ] ) : @xmath177 where @xmath178 may be regarded as an unimportant non - singular contribution , the value of which depends on the choice of reference length - scale @xmath144 . in the interfacial model ( [ effham ] ) with short - ranged forces the only possible choice of length - scale intrinsic to the interface is the inverse surface stiffness so that @xmath179 which is directly proportional to the bulk correlation length ( and recall we have set @xmath180 ) . with this choice of reference length - scale our expression for the point tension in pure systems",
    "is simply @xmath181 in terms of the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath182 this is equivalent to @xmath183 which will be useful when we consider random - bond systems .    having derived this result using the alu identification observe that the logarithmic divergence of the point tension for pure systems is also consistent with the behaviour of the pdf @xmath184 for wetting at a single wall . to see this recall that , similar to the correlation length @xmath47 ( for the @xmath141 strip geometry ) , the scaling form of the pdf @xmath184 is also determined by the surface free - energy and point tension . ignoring the normalisation constraint for the moment ,",
    "notice that @xmath184 may be identified as @xmath185 where @xmath186 denotes the excess free - energy cost of an interfacial configuration constrained to be at height @xmath187 at some arbitrary position along the wall ( which we can take to be the origin ) .",
    "for asymptotically large distances @xmath188 typical interfacial configurations determining @xmath184 will have a triangular shape with incident angle @xmath104 .",
    "the free - energy @xmath186 can therefore be estimated as @xmath189 showing contributions from two point tensions and the surface free - energies .",
    "notice this latter term is precisely twice the value of the analogous contribution to the alu correlation length ( [ expo ] ) so we immediately recover the expression for the pdf ( [ pdfthermal ] ) . to extract the point tension from @xmath184 we have to bear in mind that unlike the correlation length identification ( [ expo ] ) the pdf satisfies the addition constraint of normalisation .",
    "moreover in 2d one is not capable of distinguishing the normalisation constant from the point tension term @xmath190 since the latter term is simply another constant ( independent of @xmath187 ) . turning this around we observe that the normalisation constant @xmath191 appearing in the asymptotic scaling form @xmath192 must be related to the ( exponential ) of the point tension .",
    "the alu identification of @xmath22 through the correlation length @xmath47 is in fact in precise accord with the behaviour of the pdf provided we identify @xmath193 or more simply @xmath194 where again @xmath144 is an appropriate intrinsic length - scale introduced for dimensional reasons and which plays no role in determining the divergence of @xmath22 . using the choice @xmath179 appropriate to the interfacial model we recover the alu identification ( [ cwpoint ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the evaluation of the point tension for 2d critical wetting with random bond disorder .",
    "together with the interfacial model result for pure systems this will be crucial in our discussion of the scaling connections between filling and the sfl regime of critical wetting . with random bond disorder the interfacial model for 2d wetting is written @xcite @xmath146 = \\int dx \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2 } \\left(\\frac { dl}{dx } \\right)^2 + hl+w(l ) + v_r(x ,",

    "a 2d wedge is a ` v ' shaped substrate formed from the junction of two planar ( identical ) walls that meet at the origin ( say ) with angles @xmath251 and @xmath252 measured w.r.t to the @xmath23 line .",

    "to begin we consider mean - field theory which ignores the fluctuation effects arising from thermal excitations or quenched impurities . as first shown by rejmer @xcite ,",
    "interfacial models give a very elegant description of filling phenomena at mean - field level .",
    "for open wedges corresponding to small @xmath4 ( for which @xmath289 ) the equilibrium mean - field profile @xmath260 may be found from minimisation of the effective interfacial free - energy @xcite @xmath290 = \\int dx \\left\\ { \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\left(\\frac { dl}{dx}\\right)^2   + h(l-\\alpha \\vert x \\vert)+w(l-\\alpha \\vert x \\vert)\\right\\ } \\label{feffwedge}\\ ] ] which can be justified from analysis of a more general drumhead - like model valid for larger @xmath4 . as mentioned earlier , @xmath147 denotes the interfacial height relative to the @xmath23 line , whilst @xmath149 is the binding potential appropriate to the @xmath9 system .",

    "the free - energy functional is minimised subject to the appropriate boundary conditions that the equilibrium profile @xmath291 as @xmath292 .",
    "the resulting euler - lagrange equation can be integrated once to give an explicit equation for the mid - point height ( restricting our attention to @xmath48 ) @xcite , @xmath293 which can solved trivially .",
    "thus for binding potentials of the form ( [ bpot ] ) the dependence on @xmath294 is unimportant and the mean - field critical behaviour is determined solely by the leading order index @xmath25 . as @xmath10 we may expand the above equation @xmath295 recalling that @xmath296 remains @xmath297 at the filling transitions since @xmath298 . from this",
    "it follows immediately that the mean - field value of the height critical exponent at filling is @xmath299 @xcite .",
    "the absence of any @xmath294 dependence is a first indication that critical filling may be less sensitive to the nature of the intermolecular forces compared to critical wetting .",
    "it is possible to extend this simple mean - field approach to include thermal and disorder - induced fluctuation effects in a heuristic way .",
    "the last equation tells us how the difference or shift between the contact angle and wedge tilt angle depends on the @xmath300 influence of the intermolecular forces .",
    "in the presence of fluctuation effects arising from either thermal or random - bond disorder it is natural to suppose that ( [ eulasymp ] ) generalises to @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the direct angle shift and @xmath303 is the shift arising due to fluctuation effects which we anticipate takes the form of a ratio of length - scales .",
    "now by construction @xmath303 is @xmath304 the ratio @xmath305 since this is , essentially , the first term in ( [ anglesum ] ) and is purely geometrical .",
    "instead we write @xmath306 where @xmath307 is an appropriate fluctuation - related length - scale which must be much larger than the mid - point height . if we also make the reasonable assumption that this length - scale is controlled by the wandering exponent @xmath0 then the simplest possible choice given these constraints is @xmath308 similar to the relation @xmath309 appropriate to a fluctuation - dominated ( wfl or sfl regime ) wetting transition .",
    "consequently if fluctuations dominate we anticipate @xmath310 similar to the length - scale ratio @xmath311 ( [ precursor ] ) appearing in the lipowsky - fisher analysis .",
    "this simple , heuristic modification of the mean - field analysis is particularly powerful because for filling the phase boundary always remains @xmath3 and is not modified by fluctuations .",
    "it follows that the critical behaviour should fall into two possible classes :    * * filling mean field ( fmf ) regime * - if @xmath312 fluctuation effects are negligible , @xmath313 and the critical exponent @xmath299 is unchanged from its mean - field value .",
    "* * filling fluctuation ( ffl ) regime * - if @xmath314 there are large - scale fluctuations , @xmath315 , and the critical exponents are universal and determined by the wandering exponent .",
    "for the divergence of the filling height we predict @xmath316 with the values of the other critical exponents following from the relations ( [ delf ] ) and ( [ bef ] ) .    at this point ,",
    "a number of remarks are in order :    * these predictions are in perfect agreement with exact results known from transfer - matrix and replica trick studies of interfacial models which find @xmath317 and @xmath318 for pure ( @xmath61 ) and impure ( @xmath62 ) systems with short - ranged forces @xcite .",
    "they are also consistent with studies of filling ( corner wetting ) in square lattice ising models @xcite .",
    "moreover for pure systems it is possible to completely classify the critical behaviour using the interfacial model @xcite and show that the criticality falls into the above two regimes with a marginal value @xmath319 corresponding to the ffl / mf borderline .",
    "the critical exponent remains @xmath317 for this marginal case .",
    "+ * the existence of two fluctuation regimes for filling clearly contrasts with the phenomenology of critical wetting for which there are three . also note that the borderline between the ffl and fmf regime occurs when @xmath320 which is different to the sfl / wfl and wfl / mf borderlines for critical wetting which happen when @xmath321 and @xmath322 respectively .",
    "the regime in which there is universal critical behaviour is broader for filling than for wetting . + * the value of the critical exponent @xmath299 in the fmf regime is different to the value @xmath81 in the mf regime of critical wetting .",
    "therefore when the intermolecular forces are sufficiently long - ranged to induce induce mean - field - like criticality , there is no apparent connection between filling and wetting .",
    "however for sufficiently short - ranged forces the predicted value for the critical exponent @xmath323 ( [ bf ] ) , belonging to the ffl regime , is the same as the random - walk result for the critical exponent @xmath324 for the critical wetting sfl regime ( [ sfl1 ] ) .",
    "this is a first hint that there may be some fluctuation - induced connection between the two transitions .      in the ffl regime",
    "we anticipate that , within the filled region of the wedge , the density profile @xmath254 exhibits universal scaling behaviour related to the scaling of the interfacial height pdf .",
    "we will focus on the behaviour of the density profile and distribution function occurring at the centre of the wedge ( @xmath204 ) and define @xmath325 .",
    "thus , for @xmath326 , @xmath327 , @xmath51 with @xmath328 and @xmath329 arbitrary we expect @xmath330 where the scaling function satisfies @xmath331 and @xmath332 for any @xmath333 . notice that unlike the case of critical wetting , where one has to distinguish between scaling behaviour in the sfl and wfl regimes , the scaling function for fluctuation - dominated filling is unique . associated with the scaling of the profile is a sde describing the algebraic behaviour close to the wall compared to the filling height . at @xmath48",
    "we write , analogous to ( [ gamma ] ) @xmath334 which introduces our final critical exponent @xmath335 for filling and which is only defined for the ffl regime .",
    "similar to sde exponents for sfl and wfl regime wetting , the value of the critical exponent @xmath336 is not independent and can be related to the other exponents defined for filling . to see this , consider that the value of the wall - fluid intermolecular potential contains an additional short - ranged contribution of strength @xmath337 localised to the bottom of the wedge . in a magnetic ( ising ) language",
    "this is would correspond to an incremental point field at the wedge apex and serves only to introduce a new non - singular length - scale proportional to the value of the field .",
    "this is useful because differentiation of the wedge free - energy w.r.t .",
    "@xmath337 yields the value of the density at or near the wedge bottom .",
    "now the field @xmath337 is irrelevant , in the renormalisation group sense , and can be included in the scaling hypothesis for the free - energy ( [ wsing ] ) by allowing for an additional scaling variable @xmath338 which is simply the ratio of relevant length - scales .",
    "differentiation of the singular contribution to the wedge free - energy therefore implies that the singular contribution to the density at the wedge bottom is simply @xmath339 where we have used the exponent relation ( [ bef ] ) .",
    "however from the sde we can also identify @xmath340 implying that @xmath341 which will later prove to be an extremely useful exponent relation .    the scaling of the profile at filling follows from the scaling of the pdf for the mid - point interfacial height , written @xmath342 , similar to ( [ density ] ) . at bulk coexistence , @xmath48 , we simply write @xmath343 in the ffl regime we expect that @xmath6 is characterised by a universal scaling function @xmath344 such that @xmath345 where @xmath344 is a universal function and the inverse length - scale @xmath115 is chosen , as with @xmath114 , so that the argument is simply @xmath346 .",

    "firstly , from the first relation ( [ law0 ] ) , it necessarily follows that @xmath393 in agreement with the heuristic scaling theory .",
    "it is important to realise that this identification does @xmath304 depend on the specific values of the critical exponents pertinent to the sfl regime since the divergence of @xmath394 as @xmath395 is determined by the critical exponent @xmath396 ( [ hat ] ) rather than by @xmath324 .",

    "recalling the general critical exponent relations ( [ sde2]),([sdew ] ) for these leads to the identification @xmath401 and using the above value for @xmath323 we find @xmath402 which re - derives the random - walk predictions for the critical wetting sfl regime .",
    "thus the covariance relations severely restrict the allowed values of the critical exponents for both 2d filling and 2d critical wetting .",
    "next we turn our attention to the free - energy covariance law .",
    "taking the derivative of ( [ law2 ] ) w.r.t .",
    "@xmath4 we find @xmath403 and setting @xmath275 we arrive at a novel result relating the planar interfacial height to the point tension : @xmath404 valid for interfacial models with short - ranged forces ( or in the asymptotic sfl critical regime ) .",
    "this relation has a number of consequences .",
    "first , equating the power - law critical singularities on either side yields @xmath405 which reduces to @xmath406 thus deriving the conjectured indekeu - robledo exponent relation .",
    "we emphasise that in this manipulation we have only used the general exponent relation ( [ rush ] ) without having to introduce any results specific to @xmath407 .",
    "this is strongly suggestive that a generalisation of ( [ newresult ] ) , with possibly different numerical pre - factors , may well exist for sfl regime critical wetting in higher dimensional systems .",
    "secondly , beyond simple power - law singularities we can now see that the logarithmic divergence of the point tension for purely thermal systems found by alu is , in fact , necessary in order that the interfacial height diverges as @xmath408 .",
    "the values of all the other critical exponents for filling and wetting now follow from standard exponent relations .",
    "the connection between them can be summarised by @xmath409 where the lhs and rhs refer to the ffl and sfl regimes respectively .",
    "finally , for completeness , we remark that for pure systems it has been shown @xcite that for the marginal case @xmath319 ,",
    "@xmath410 corresponding to the ffl / fmf boundary , the covariance laws for the interfacial height and pdf relate the behaviour at filling to the wfl / mf regime of wetting .",
    "the wedge free - energy can be easily calculated for this case and is similar to ( [ 3 ] ) but has a numerical pre - factor @xmath411 in front of each logarithm .",
    "however we do not discuss the possible connection with the point tension because we are not confident that for such long - ranged forces @xmath22 is a well - defined quantity .",
    "whilst an expression for @xmath22 can be found for such systems using the pdf identification , and is in accord with the covariance law , we have not been able to extract @xmath22 using another , independent , method .",
    "we feel such a check is necessary since , as shown by alu , even for short - ranged forces , the convolution definition of @xmath22 can lead to different results .",
    "moreover for @xmath319 it is not obvious that @xmath22 can be extracted using a generalisation of the alu correlation length identification .",
    "it may even be that the covariance relation between the wedge - free energy and the point tension can be forwarded as a suitable definition of the point tension for interfacial models with this marginal interaction .",
    "this would certainly be consistent with the indekeu - robledo conjecture for the point tension singularity .",
    "our treatment so far has concentrated on critical singularities occurring at bulk two - phase coexistence @xmath48 .",
    "given the precise connection between 2d filling and wetting occurring at coexistence it is natural to enquire whether this extends to quantities defined for @xmath412 .",
    "away from two - phase coexistence , however , any possible relation between 2d filling and wetting is certainly subtler than that occurring for @xmath48 because the pertinent gap exponents @xmath283 and @xmath41 are different .",
    "thus the divergences of @xmath413 and @xmath414 along the respective filling and wetting critical isotherms are quite different and preclude a law of type ( [ law0 ] ) .",
    "similarly there can be no simple generalisation of the free - energy relation ( [ law2 ] ) because the point tension is only defined for @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that we first look for covariance relations between response functions for ffl filling and sfl critical wetting describing infinitesimal deviations from bulk coexistence .",
    "such relations , should they exist , will also be notable because response functions are generally related to integrals over two - point functions which would suggest that these too satisfy covariance relations .",
    "before we calculate the scaling expressions for pdf and local compressibility for 2d filling we recall some pertinent results known for critical wetting .      differentiating the scaling ansatz for the profile @xmath92 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath279 immediately implies that in the scaling limit of the sfl regime , and up to an unimportant non - universal pre - factor @xmath415 , the local compressibility @xmath416 evaluated at bulk - coexistence ( @xmath48 ) has the form @xcite @xmath417 where @xmath418 is a scaling function describing the universal position dependence .",
    "this is independent of the range of the forces and is specified by the dimension and type of disorder only .",
    "again we emphasise this is valid in the asymptotic scaling limit @xmath21 , @xmath326 with @xmath419 arbitrary .",
    "the sde is controlled by the same exponent as the density profile so that @xmath420 as @xmath248",
    ". by adopting the convention that the pre - factor is unity , the scale of @xmath421 is fixed and we can regard the scaling function as universal . in effective hamiltonian theory the behaviour of the compressibility is directly related to that of the pdf since from ( [ density ] ) we have @xmath422 the scaling form of the pdf , density profile and local compressibility emerges naturally from the interfacial model if we use the same boundary condition ( [ bound1 ] ) but retain the @xmath423 term in the hamiltonian . as shown by several authors , for @xmath412 the ground - state wave function is an airy function @xcite implying @xmath424 where , for the sake of clarity , we have dropped non - universal metric factors and written the field dependence in terms of @xmath425 . taking into account the @xmath279 dependence coming from the free - energy scaling function @xmath42 and the normalisation constant , it is straightforward to show that @xmath18 scales according to the prediction ( [ chisfl ] ) with a universal scaling function @xcite @xmath426 notice that the sde behaviour of this function is in accord with the general requirement([sdchi ] ) although a different power - law determines the algebraic correction to the asymptotic exponential decay .      in zero field",
    "the mid - point local compressibility , @xmath427 , should also show scaling behaviour analogous to the behaviour occurring at sfl regime critical wetting .",
    "following our treatment above it follows from the profile equation ( [ rhof ] ) that for @xmath428 , @xmath429 with fixed @xmath430 , @xmath431 where @xmath432 is the appropriate scaling function whose sde is described by the critical exponent @xmath336 .",
    "thus we expect @xmath433 and by again adopting the convention that the critical amplitude is exactly unity we can fix the scale of the universal function @xmath432 .",
    "the behaviour of the mid - point pdf at filling can be easily calculated using the transfer matrix result ( [ p ] ) and after a little algebra we obtain @xmath434 which is considerably simpler then the planar result .",
    "note that the @xmath279 dependence of this scaling function has a simple geometrical meaning since the term @xmath435 corresponds precisely to the area of the filled region of the 2d wedge . from ( [ gaus ] )",
    "it is easy to check our earlier prediction that , along the critical filling isotherm ( @xmath269,@xmath51 ) , the interfacial height diverges as @xmath436 .",
    "we find @xmath437 in perfect agreement with the expected behaviour for purely thermal disorder ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "it is also immediate from ( [ gaus ] ) that the roughness @xmath438 along the critical isotherm .",
    "we mention in passing here that this behaviour contrasts with the singularities occurring at @xmath439 filling corresponding to @xmath51 for @xmath440 . for this transition",
    "it is apparent from ( [ gaus ] ) that the critical behaviour is not fluctuation - dominated and @xmath441 whilst @xmath442 .",
    "the divergence of @xmath259 agrees with predictions based solely on thermodynamic and mean - field arguments which remain valid because the fluctuation effects at complete filling are small even for the present two - dimensional system with short - ranged forces .",
    "returning to the local compressibility we can readily calculate the desired expression for the zero - field local compressibility using the pdf ( [ gaus ] ) .",
    "taking care to account for the @xmath279 dependence of the normalisation factor we find that the local compressibility is precisely of the form ( [ chif ] ) with @xmath443 and a scaling function @xmath444 which is identical to that derived for sfl regime critical wetting .",
    "thus we write @xmath445    in terms of the full angle dependence the scaling local compressibilities satisfy the simple covariance relationship @xmath446 valid in the asymptotic critical regime @xmath10 .",
    "the identity of the local compressibility scaling functions for filling and sfl wetting is the main result of this section . whilst we have only demonstrated this for pure systems we expect this is also valid for systems filling and wetting in other 2d systems provided that @xmath447 .",
    "support for this conjecture comes from the derived values of the critical exponent relations .",
    "in particular in the limit @xmath448 and @xmath449 the sde s for the local compressibilities are identical and hence their ratio must be independent of @xmath100 .",
    "moreover the values of the exponents @xmath283 and @xmath450 are always such that the ratio is proportional to @xmath451 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "it therefore seems highly likely that the covariance relation ( [ lawchif2 ] ) is also valid for impure systems and can be checked in future studies .",
    "our discussion of the implications of the covariance relations in  5 was simply based on comparison with the predictions of standard scaling theory for critical exponent relations and the short - distance expansions . with a little more input concerning the properties of the interfacial hamiltonian model we can also use the wedge - covariance relations to re -",
    "derive the results of the transfer matrix studies without explicit calculation .",
    "the following discussion is restricted to thermal disorder although a generalisation to the impure systems may well be possible using the replica trick method .    in terms of the relative interfacial height @xmath452 we can write the wedge hamiltonian as a perturbation from the planar model @xmath453=h[\\tilde{l}]+\\delta h_w [ \\tilde{l } ] \\label{perturb}\\ ] ] where @xmath454=-2\\sigma \\alpha\\int dx \\delta(x)\\tilde{l}(x ) \\label{stress}\\ ] ] and we have ignored @xmath359-independent terms and the boundary conditions concerning the end - points @xmath455 which do not matter in the thermodynamic limit . because the planar interfacial hamiltonian and the wedge perturbation are both local it immediately follows that , up to a trivial normalisation constant , the mid - point height pdf for pure systems satisfies @xmath456 which is equivalent to ( [ p ] ) .",
    "wedge covariance of the pdf at bulk coexistence implies @xmath457 and setting @xmath458 it follows that @xmath459 where the position dependence of @xmath460 is determined solely by the sde .",
    "using the known critical exponent relation for @xmath400 we conclude that within the sfl regime the pdf is necessarily of the form @xmath461 from this it follows that @xmath462 and since @xmath463 the only value of @xmath0 consistent with the wedge covariance hypothesis in pure systems is @xmath464 implying that @xmath465 .",
    "similarly the universal scaling function for the pdf in the sfl must be simply @xmath466    now consider the pdf off coexistence and note that the exponential boost factor _ does not _",
    "depend on the bulk field @xmath279 .",
    "it follows that in the asymptotic critical regime , the scaling functions for filling and wetting satisfy the simple quotient relation @xmath467 where the constant of proportionality is trivially determined from the normalisation conditions on each pdf .",
    "keeping the value of @xmath0 arbitrary for the moment it follows that to first order in @xmath279 the quotient has the expansion @xmath468 where @xmath469 is a pure number and @xmath470 denotes the appropriate moment of the interfacial height evaluated at @xmath48 .",
    "the various terms in this expansion arise for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the quotient must tend to unity as @xmath51 ; ( 2 ) the expansion must be linear in @xmath279 because @xmath471 is a non - singular function of @xmath279 for @xmath472 ; ( 3 ) the power - law dependence @xmath473 is necessary since along the filling critical isotherm ( @xmath458 , @xmath51 ) scaling demands that @xmath436 ; ( 4 ) the dependence on @xmath4 follows from conditions ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) given the anticipated scaling form of pdf @xmath110 ; ( 5 ) the additive term involving @xmath470 arises from the normalisation condition on each pdf .    from ( [ pen ] )",
    "we immediately observe that the universal scaling functions @xmath474 and @xmath475 for ffl filling and sfl wetting must be related according to @xmath476 where @xmath477 and the constant of proportionality in ( [ soon ] ) is trivially fixed by the condition that @xmath478 for small x. at this point we can substitute the appropriate expressions @xmath479 and @xmath61 for pure systems and integrate to find @xmath480 in agreement with the transfer matrix calculation . the differential equation ( [ soon ] ) is also an effective method of calculating the covariant scaling function for the local compressibility at the ffl / fmf ( or equivalently wfl / mf ) borderline with @xmath319,@xmath410 for which the pdf function @xmath474 has a non - trivial sde @xcite .",
    "further work is required to see if similar approaches can determine the allowed values of @xmath0 , @xmath474 and @xmath475 for disordered systems without using the full transfer matrix formulism .",
    "in this paper we have investigated fluctuation effects occurring at 2d filling and the fundamental connection with the sfl regime of critical wetting .",
    "our study has revealed that in addition to the known covariance of the interfacial height and pdf @xcite , the wedge free - energy and mid - point local susceptibility are also related to the point tension and local susceptibility at wetting .",
    "these relations are extremely restrictive and determine the allowed values of the critical exponents at ffl filling @xmath20 sfl wetting without further assumptions other than those of standard scaling theory . moreover if wedge covariance is combined with knowledge of how the wedge hamiltonian is perturbed from the planar interfacial model , then very specific predictions for the value of the wandering exponent , critical exponents and scaling functions can be obtained .",
    "thus wedge covariance appears to play a similar role to the principle of conformal invariance for 2d bulk critical phenomena in that it yields predictions over and above those of scaling and scale invariance .",
    "wedge covariance also bring new insights into the nature of the sfl regime wetting transition itself .",
    "in particular we have shown that the covariance relation for the wedge free - energy provides a means of deriving the conjectured indekeu - robledo relation for the critical singularity of the point tension and also explains its logarithmic divergence for pure systems .",
    "other aspects of our work that have not been presented before include the derivation of an expression for the point tension for impure systems and the development of a scaling theory and derivation of critical exponent relations for 2d filling transitions .",
    "it is hoped that the present work motivates the further study of filling transitions in both two and three dimensional , pure and impure systems . within the framework of the present , small @xmath4 interfacial model , future",
    "work could include discussion of two - point functions .",
    "these may well exhibit some covariance properties as suggested by the behaviour of the local compressibility .",
    "non - linear functional renormalisation group analyses , both approximate and exact decimation @xcite type , would also shed light on the likely expanded space of the sfl regime fixed point .",
    "studies of fluctuation effects at filling using other models such as the full drumhead interfacial hamiltonian or lattice ising model , for which only limited results are known @xcite , would also be very welcome .",
    "it would also be interesting to see if the formal statistical mechanical theory of fluids at interfaces , with its powerful sum - rule and correlation function hierarchies @xcite , can be applied to the problem .",
    "perturbative expansions of the many - body hamiltonian analogous to ( [ perturb ] ) and ( [ stress ] ) may prove revealing .",
    "staying within the framework of effective hamiltonian theory it would be highly informative if the nature of both 3d wedge and cone filling were understood beyond the case of purely thermal disorder .",
    "it is likely that this would also shed more light on the nature of the sfl regime in higher dimensions about which very little is currently known .",
    "nevertheless the simple heuristic picture of how the filling of a 2d wedge manages to precisely mimic the behaviour of the sfl regime , does generalise rather naturally to the cone geometry which similarly enforces the same qualitative type of conic interfacial configuration that determines large deviations in the one - point function at wetting .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the indekeu - robledo critical exponent relation may also be intimately tied to a possible covariance for three dimensional wedge free - energy although much further work is required to quantify this .",
