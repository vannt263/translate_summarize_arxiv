    "the discovery of both an x - ray ( costa et al . 1997a ) and optical ( groot et al . 1997 ) afterglow to grb 970228 revolutionized the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) field .",
    "the mean temporal and spectral properties of this afterglow appeared to be consistent with the relativistic fireball model ( tavani 1997 ; waxman 1997 ; wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 ; reichart 1997 ; sahu et al .",
    "1997 ; katz & piran 1997 ) , which predicted that grbs would have afterglows at these and radio wavelengths ( paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; katz 1994 ; mszros & rees 1997 ) .",
    "however , now that the photometry has been finalized , and perhaps more importantly , now that nearly a dozen optical afterglows to grbs are available for comparison , the afterglow of grb 970228 is perhaps the most difficult of the observed afterglows to reconcile with the fireball model ( see  2 ) .",
    "the most problematic feature of this afterglow for the fireball model is its extreme reddening with time : v - i changes from @xmath0 mag 21 hours after the burst to @xmath1 mag 26 days after the burst and @xmath2 mag 38 days after the burst .",
    "bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that the afterglow of grb 980326 exhibits a similar behavior , and argued that this is due to a supernova that overtook the light curve of the afterglow about one week after the burst .",
    "unfortunately , late afterglow data is sparse in the case of grb980326 , and its redshift is not yet known .",
    "data is more plentiful , both temporally and spectrally , in the case of grb 970228 , and its redshift , @xmath3 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1999 ) , is known . therefore , in this letter , we build on the groundbreaking work of bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and investigate the suggestion of dar ( 1999 ) that a supernova dominated the late afterglow of grb 970228 . in  3 , we argue that the r - band light curve of this afterglow favors this hypothesis . in  4 , we argue that the spectral energy distribution of this afterglow at late times also favors this hypothesis .",
    "we draw conclusions in  5 .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , the most problematic feature of the afterglow of grb 970228 for the relativistic fireball model is the afterglow s extreme reddening with time .",
    "the fireball model can accommodate mild reddening ; e.g. , the passage of either the synchrotron or cooling breaks of this model s spectrum ( see e.g. , sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) through these bands would increase the v @xmath4 i color of the afterglow by @xmath5 mag .",
    "however , in the case of grb 970228 , v @xmath4 i increased by @xmath6 1.6 mag .    to better quantify how this afterglow changed from early to late times ,",
    "we have collected from the literature the published optical and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry of the afterglow , which we list in table 1 , as well as that of the underlying host galaxy , which we list in table 2 . in figure 1",
    ", we plot the bvri photometry of the afterglow . excluding the 1.5-m bologna university telescope ( but ) photometry at @xmath6 17 hours after the burst ( see guarnieri et al .",
    "1997 for a discussion of these data ) , clear and distinct trends can be seen in the early ( @xmath7 days after the burst ) and late ( @xmath8 days after the burst ) subsets of these data : the late afterglow appears to have faded more slowly than the early afterglow , and as already mentioned , the late afterglow appears to have been considerably redder than the early afterglow .",
    "the intermediate afterglow ( 5 days @xmath9 days ) appears to have been transitional between these two limiting behaviors .    to quantify these limiting behaviors ,",
    "we have fitted the functional form @xmath10 to these two subsets of the data . for the early afterglow , we find that @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) ; for the late afterglow , we find that @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . in the case of the early afterglow ,",
    "the afterglow dominated the host galaxy ( see tables 1 and 2 ) ; consequently , we could ignore the contribution of the host galaxy in this fit . in the case of the late afterglow , all of the measurements , except for the keck - ii 10-m r - band measurement of metzger et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , were made from hst images ; in these cases , the angular resolution was sufficient to separate the afterglow from the host galaxy . in the case of the r - band measurement , we instead fitted the functional form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the flux density of the host galaxy in the r band .",
    "employing bayesian inference , we adopted a prior probability distribution for @xmath20 , given by the hst / stis r - band measurement of castander & lamb ( 1999b ; see also fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to confirm that the afterglow is not consistent with a single power - law spectrum and a single power - law fading , we fitted the above functional forms to the entire bvri data set , excluding the but 1.5-m photometry and the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope ( int ) b - band measurement at @xmath6 10 days , which may be dominated by the host galaxy ( no b - band measurement of the host galaxy is available for comparison ) .",
    "we find that @xmath21 for @xmath22 degrees of freedom . if we restrict ourselves to the data set fitted to above , we find that @xmath23 for @xmath24 . comparing the model fitted above with this model , we find that @xmath25 for @xmath26 ; using the @xmath27 test , this implies that the above `` two limiting power - law behaviors '' model is favored over this `` single power - law behavior '' model at the @xmath28 confidence level .",
    "the temporal index of the early afterglow , @xmath12 , is similar to that found by costa et al .",
    "( 1997b ) in the 2 - 10 kev band ( @xmath29 , 8 hours @xmath30 days ) , and to that found by frontera et al .",
    "1998 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band ( @xmath31 , 8 hours @xmath32 days ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectral index of the early afterglow , @xmath11 , is consistent with the optical to x - ray spectral index of the afterglow at these early times : @xmath33 .",
    "finally , both the spectral and temporal indices of the early afterglow are consistent ( 1 ) with the spectral and temporal indices of other afterglows , and ( 2 ) with the general expectations of the fireball model .",
    "however , the spectral index of the late afterglow , @xmath15 , is not consistent with the general expectations of the fireball model . in principle",
    ", one could achieve this extremely negative spectral index if the afterglow were heavily extincted , either by our galaxy , by the host galaxy , or by the immediate vicinity of the burst ( see e.g. , reichart 1998 ) .",
    "however , if that were the case , either the intrinsic spectral index of the early afterglow would have to be extremely positive , which would also defy the general expectations of the fireball model , or the level of extinction would have to increase with time , which is the opposite of what one expects : the afterglow may destroy dust , but it will not create it . consequently , although the early afterglow appears to be consistent with the fireball model , the late afterglow does not .",
    "likewise , the late afterglow is equally unlikely to be due to a refreshed shock , which must also meet the general expectations of the fireball model .",
    "however , the extremely negative spectral index of the late afterglow is consistent with the general expectations of a supernova at the redshift of this burst .",
    "we return to this claim in  4 .",
    "in this section we investigate whether the r - band light curve of the afterglow of grb 970228 is consistent with a supernova overtaking the light curve of the early afterglow at late times ; we investigate whether the spectral energy distribution of the late afterglow is consistent with this hypothesis in  4 .",
    "first , we construct the r - band light curve .",
    "we do this by scaling all non - r - band measurements to the r - band using the fitted functional forms of  2 ; we have again excluded the but 1.5-m photometry and the int 2.5-m b - band measurement ( see  2 ) . in the top panel of figure 2 , we plot the ground - based photometry of the afterglow plus the host galaxy , as well as the best - fit r - band light curve of the early afterglow from  2 plus the best - fit r - band flux density of the host galaxy from table 2 . in the bottom panel of figure 2 , we plot the space - based photometry of the afterglow , as well as the best - fit r - band light curve of the early afterglow .",
    "next , we construct an example supernova light curve .",
    "we begin with the u - band light curve of the type ib / c supernova sn 1998bw , which may or may not be related to grb 980425 .",
    "( tinney et al . 1998 ) , are not typical of any other grb afterglow observed to date , the association between grb 980425 and sn 1998bw is uncertain ( see also graziani , lamb , & marion 1999 ) .",
    "however , for the purposes of this letter , any type ib - ic supernova light curve is sufficient .",
    "we have chosen sn 1998bw primarily because it is well - sampled , and only secondarily because of its possible association with grb 980425 . ]",
    "galama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed sn 1998bw in the u band between 9 and 56 days after this burst . at earlier times",
    "we extrapolate to the u band from the b band light curve of galama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; at later times we extrapolate to the u band from the b band light curve of mckenzie & schaefer ( 1999 ) .",
    "next , we transform this u - band light curve to the redshift of grb 970228 , z = 0.695 , which involves ( 1 ) shifting it to the r band , ( 2 ) stretching it in time , and ( 3 ) dimming it . here",
    ", we have set @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; other cosmologies yield similar results .",
    "finally , we have corrected the data for differences in galactic extinction between the sn 1998bw line of sight in the u band ( @xmath36 mag ) , and the grb 970228 afterglow line of sight in the r band ( @xmath37 mag ) , using the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) in the case of the sn 1998bw line of sight , castander & lamb ( 1999a ; however , see also fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) in the case of the grb 970228 line of sight , and the galactic extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) for @xmath38 ; no attempt has been made to quantify the differences in extinction between these sources host galaxies and immediate vicinities along their respective lines of sight .",
    "this redshifted , galactic extinction - corrected , example supernova light curve is also plotted in figure 2 .",
    "despite all of the uncertainties in this example supernova light curve , including the uncertainty in its peak luminosity , which can vary by factors of a few for type ib - ic supernovae , we find the summed early afterglow plus host galaxy plus supernova light curve ( figure 2 , top panel ) and the summed early afterglow plus supernova light curve ( figure 2 , bottom panel ) to be remarkably consistent with the photometry .",
    "we have shown that the r - band light curve of the late afterglow of grb 970228 is consistent with what one would expect from a supernova at the redshift of the burst . in this section ,",
    "we go a step further and show that the spectral energy distribution of the late afterglow is also consistent with that of a supernova at this redshift , and that this consistency spans five spectral bands .",
    "first , we construct the spectral energy distribution of the late afterglow . between @xmath6 30 and @xmath6 38 days after the burst , sahu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed the afterglow in the v and i bands with hst / wfpc2 , metzger et al .",
    "( 1997b ) observed the afterglow plus host galaxy in the r band with the keck - ii 10-m , and soifer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed the afterglow plus host galaxy in the j and k bands with the keck - i 10-m . from these r- and k - band measurements of the afterglow plus host galaxy",
    ", we subtract the contribution of the host galaxy ( see table 2 ) ; as no j - band measurement of the host galaxy is available , we replace this j - band measurement of the afterglow plus host galaxy with an upper limit .",
    "next , we scale these afterglow measurements to a common time , @xmath39 days after the burst , using the fitted functional form of the late afterglow from  2 ; as these measurements are nearly coincident in @xmath40 , this adjustment is minor . finally , we correct these afterglow measurements for galactic extinction along the line of sight ( see  3 ) .",
    "we plot the resulting galactic extinction - corrected , five - band spectral energy distribution of the late afterglow in figure 3 .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot in figure 3 the galactic extinction - corrected , redshifted spectral energy distribution of sn 1998bw ( see  3 ) , which galama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed in the u , b , v , r , and i bands @xmath41 days after grb 980425 .",
    "when transformed to the redshift of grb 970228 , these measurements span the r through j bands .    to the limit of the uncertainties in the late afterglow spectral energy distribution measurements , and to the limit of the smaller wavelength range of the redshifted sn 1998bw spectral energy distribution , these distributions appear to be nearly identical . furthermore , the relativistic fireball model is not expected to produce a spectral break of this nature , especially so long after the burst .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the late afterglow of grb 970228 was most likely dominated by a supernova .",
    "in conclusion , while the early afterglow of grb 970228 appears to have been consistent with the general expectations of the relativistic fireball model , the late afterglow does not appear to have been consistent with this model . nor was it similar to any of the other observed afterglows , with the sole exception of the afterglow of grb 980326 , which bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) attribute to a supernova that overtook the light curve .",
    "we find that this was most likely the case with grb 970228 . not only is the light curve of the afterglow consistent with this hypothesis , but more convincingly , the spectral energy distribution of the late afterglow is also consistent with this hypothesis , and this consistency spans five spectral bands .",
    "furthermore , the identification of the late afterglow of grb 970228 with a supernova strengthens the case that other grbs , in particular , grb 980326 and grb 980425 , are indeed related to supernovae .",
    "however , in the case of grb 980425 , many reservations remain (  3 ) .",
