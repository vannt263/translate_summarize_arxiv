    "an increasing number of observational data , obtained in the past few years , strongly support a model according to which the universe is spatially flat , mostly made of non - conventional matter ",
    "baryons being allowed only up to @xmath1 of the total energy content  and accelerating .",
    "the physical models accounting for such a picture generally contain two basic ingredients : pressureless dark matter ( dm ) , responsible for the growth of cosmological perturbations via gravitational instability , and negative pressure dark energy ( de ) , responsible for the accelerated expansion ( for recent reviews on the dark energy problem see  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest model along these lines is @xmath2cdm , in which the role of de is played by a cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "it fits very well all the data related with the cosmological background and the perturbations in the linear regime  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant is attributed to the quantum zero - point energy of the particle physics vacuum , with a constant energy density @xmath3 , pressure @xmath4 and an equation of state @xmath5 .",
    "existing observational data indicate the equation of state of dark energy very close to the cosmological constant value , @xmath6 at @xmath7 confidence level , with at most a very mild evolution up to redshift @xmath8 .",
    "an alternative model to the cosmological constant may be the quintessence  @xcite , a dynamical scalar field which , in the simplest model , slowly rolls in a potential characterized by an extremely low mass .",
    "the spatially averaged equation of state for the quintessence field satisfies @xmath9 . in order to avoid fine - tuning on the initial conditions , the quintessence scalar field",
    "is usually taken to be extremely light , with a compton wavelength corresponding to the present value of the hubble radius . as a consequence ,",
    "the scalar field is homogeneous on all observable scales , much like a cosmological constant .",
    "however , quintessence models suffer from an important theoretical problem , namely , the fact that radiative corrections induced by the couplings with the matter fields would generically induce huge corrections to the trace level mass , thus spoiling the required lightness . hence to keep the scalar field light in these models a fine - tuning on the radiative corrections is generally required , besides the one necessary to keep the cosmological constant small .",
    "a wide variety of other dark energy models has also been proposed , including k - essence  @xcite , chaplygin gas  @xcite , modifications of gravity  @xcite , born - infeld scalars ( rolling tachyon )  @xcite , massive scalars  @xcite etc .",
    "the common feature of these models is that they operate through an undetermined field potential which in principle can incorporate any a priori associated cosmological evolution , thus lacking predictive power at the fundamental level  @xcite .",
    "there is a tremendous degeneracy in these models and generally they are judged by their physical implications and by the generic features which arise in them .",
    "therefore a consistent physical picture of the dark energy , which could explain the size of its energy density @xmath10 , and suggests how the underlying physics may be probed , is still missing .",
    "non - gravitational interactions are known to be mediated by vector fields .",
    "therefore the possibility that a vector field , which , for example , may be a partner of quintessence , could be at the origin of the present stage of the cosmic acceleration can not be neglected .",
    "theoretical proposals in which a minimally coupled vector field is responsible for the present dynamics of the universe have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to propose a model of the dark energy in terms of a massive , proca type vector field , with a non - minimal coupling to the gravitational field .",
    "the model contains three independent parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , with @xmath14 representing the mass of the massive cosmological vector particle .",
    "the scalars @xmath11 and @xmath12 describe the non - minimal coupling of the vector field to the ricci scalar and to the ricci tensor , respectively .",
    "the gravitational field equations can be consistently derived from a variational principle . a similar vector - tensor theory , without the mass term ,",
    "was also proposed in the early 1970 s  @xcite .    in the cosmological case",
    ", corresponding to a flat homogeneous and isotropic universe , the friedmann equations acquire an extra dark - energy component , which is proportional to the mass of the vector particle .",
    "this term , playing the role of the cosmological constant , leads to the late accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the free parameters of the model ( gravitational coupling constants and initial value of the cosmological vector field ) can be estimated by using the ppn solar system constraints .",
    "the mass of the cosmological massive vector particle , which may represent the main component of the universe , is of the order of @xmath0 g.    the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the field equations of the massive vector - tensor theory are derived in section ii . in section iii",
    "we consider the cosmological applications of the model .",
    "the ppn constraints on the model parameters are discussed in section iv .",

    ", it should be emphasized that our model would not be in good agreement with @xmath130 , a constant effective gravitational `` constant '' .",
    "from eq .  ( [ h ] ) we obtain for the mass of the cosmological vector particle the expression @xmath131 the upper limit for the mass of the ordinary photon obtained by using a rotating torsion balance method is @xmath132  @xcite . it should be noted that the proposed massive vector field interacts only with gravity and has no standard matter interactions .",
    "the existence of a minimal mass in nature in the presence of a cosmological constant has been discussed for example in  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the cosmological massive vector particle may have been generated during inflation .",
    "inflation allows the emergence of fields coherent over large distances from quantum fluctuations and prevents dissipative effects , due to the absence of charged particles .",
    "the conformal invariance of the u(1 ) gauge theory for electromagnetism prevents the gravitational field from producing photons .",
    "however , in the present model , due to the breaking of the conformal invariance , via the coupling to gravity , the vector particle interacting with gravity can acquire an effective mass .",
    "therefore , the effective mass for the massive vector particle composing the cosmological gas filling the universe , and representing its main matter component , may have originated during inflation  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the cosmological vector particle can also be acquired from the spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry in the context of field theories arising from string field theory , or due to the introduction of a fundamental minimal length in a trans - planckian physics scenario  @xcite .",
    "the vector field dominated universe enters in a pure exponential de sitter phase when the condition @xmath133 is satisfied . with the use of the values of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 obtained from the ppn solar system constraints we obtain @xmath134 , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath135 .",
    "in fact , the supernova data published by the high-@xmath136 supernova search team and the supernova cosmology project show that the transition from the decelerating to the accelerating phase occurred at redshifts smaller than @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the model predicts that the accelerated expansion phase of the universe started only recently .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the dark energy can be modeled as a massive cosmological vector field filling the universe .",
