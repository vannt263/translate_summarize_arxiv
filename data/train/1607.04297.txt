    "now it is widely accepted that an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disc . above the accretion disc , there is dense , rapidly - moving gas making up the so - called broad line region ( blr ) emitting broad emission lines by reprocessing the continuum radiation from the inner accretion disc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the blr is believed to consist of dense clumps of hot gas ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ; @xmath14k ) in a much hotter , rarefied medium .",
    "the motions of the line - emitting clouds is the main cause of the broadening of the line profiles .",
    "the profiles of the broad emission lines is a major source of information about the geometry and kinematics of the blr .",
    "profiles can be broadly categorized into two shape : single - peaked and double - peaked .",
    "it is believed that double - peaked profiles are emitted from disc - like clumpy structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although obvious double - peaked profiles are seen in only small fraction of agns , this does not mean that such discs are absent in other agns .",
    "based on some studies , under the specific conditions , disc - like clumpy structure can even produce single - peaked broad emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations ( @xcite ) imply the presence of clumpy discs in blr . on the other hand ,",
    "other authors have suggested a two - component model in which they consider a spherical distribution of clouds surrounding the central black hole in addition to their distribution in the midplane ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this model , while the disc is responsible for the production of the broad wings , the spherical distribution is responsible for the narrow cores .",
    "the integrated emission line profile is a combination of wings and cores .    using the width of the broad balmer emission lines , @xmath7 , and an effective blr radius , @xmath15 , which is obtained by either reverberation mapping ( rm ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) or from the relationship between optical luminosity and @xmath15 ( @xcite ) , masses of black holes",
    "are estimated from the virial theorem , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant and @xmath0 is the  virial factor \" depending on the geometry and kinematics of the blr and the inclination angle , @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately with current technology it is impossible to directly observe the structure of the blr .",
    "therefore the true value of @xmath10 for each object is unknown and we are required to use average virial factor , @xmath11 , to estimate the mass of supermassive black hole .",
    "comparison of virial masses with independent estimates of black hole masses using to @xmath18 relationship ( see @xcite ) have given empirical estimates of the value of @xmath11 .",
    "however each study has found different value for @xmath11 .",
    "for example @xcite calculate @xmath19 , @xcite calculate @xmath20 , @xcite calculate @xmath21 and @xcite calculate @xmath22 .",
    "this is because each group take a different sample .",
    "different values for @xmath11 prevent us to have a reliable value for black hole mass .",
    "the situation for low - luminosity agns ( llagns ) is somewhat different .",
    "the lack of broad optical emission lines in the faintest cases ( @xmath23 ) has led to two scenarios about the presence of blr in llagns .",
    "the first , which is somewhat supported by the theoretical models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , simply says that the blr is absent in such faint objects .",
    "however , there is clear evidence in favor of the presence of the blr in some llagns , at least those with @xmath24 .",
    "this supports a second scenario which says that the blr exists in llagns but we can not detect them in the faintest cases because the intensity of their broad emission lines is below the detection threshold set mostly by starlight in the host galaxy . in the palomar survey",
    ", it was found that broad h@xmath25 emission is present in a remarkably high fraction of liners ( llagns)(see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , double - peaked broad emission lines have been found in some liners including ngc  7213 ( @xcite ) , ngc  1097 ( @xcite ) , m81 ( @xcite ) , ngc  4450 ( @xcite ) and ngc  4203 ( @xcite ) .",
    "other studies have also shown the presence of variable broad emission lines for ngc  1097 ( @xcite ) , m81 ( @xcite ) and ngc  3065 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite found other llagns with @xmath26 showing blrs .    since the optical spectra of llagns",
    "are severely contaminated by the host galaxy , some authors have suggested using the widths of the paschen lines rather than balmer lines to determine a @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , in order to estimate the blr radius , @xmath15 , we can use near - ir continuum luminosity at 1 @xmath27 ( @xcite ) or x - ray luminosity ( @xcite ) rather than the optical luminosity .",
    "@xcite used the boltzmann equation to describe the kinematics of blr .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the blr can be considered as a collisionless ensemble of particles . by considering the newtonian gravity of the black hole and a quadratic drag force",
    ", they used the collisionless boltzmann equation ( cbe ) to study the dynamics of the clouds for the case where magnetic forces are unimportant . following this approach",
    ", some authors included the effect of magnetic fields on the dynamics of the clouds in the blr ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the cbe to describe the distribution of the clouds in the blr .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the section ( [ s2 ] ) we will establish our basic formalism and apply it in order to classify the clumpy structure of the blr . in the section ( [ s3 ] ) we will concentrate on llagns and give more details about the distribution of the clouds in such systems .",
    "moreover , we will derive the virial factor @xmath0 for them and in the final section , the conclusions are summarized .",
    "this paper only considers axisymmetric , steady - state systems . in the subsection ( [ ss21 ] )",
    "we start by deriving the general form of the jeans equations in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath28 ) for a system of particles subject to velocity - dependent forces as well as position - dependent forces . then , by assuming axisymmetry ( @xmath29 ) and a steady state ( @xmath30 ) , we simplify the jeans equations and use them to describe the distribution of the clouds in the blr .      if we define the distribution function @xmath31 as @xmath32 , the continuity equation in the phase space ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq 4.11 ) ) is given by @xmath33 .",
    "this equation can be rewritten as @xmath34 in cartesian position - velocity space ( @xmath35 ) where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the lagrangian derivative in the phase space and the resultant acceleration vector . on the other hand by the chain rule ,",
    "the partial derivatives with respect to the cartesian components of the velocity are related to those respect to the cylindrical components by @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "also the relationship between the cartesian and cylindrical components of the acceleration vector is @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . combining all of these equations ,",
    "we obtain the extended form of the cbe in cylindrical position - velocity space ( @xmath44 ) as @xmath45@xmath46 @xmath47 as can be seen , in the absence of velocity - dependent forces , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) agrees with the standard form ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq 4.15 ) ) .",
    "as is shown in the appendix [ a1 ] , the jeans equations derived from equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be written as @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the volume number density in the position - place .",
    "equations ( [ eq2 ] ) - ( [ eq5 ] ) are an extended form of the jeans equations describing a collisionless system of particles undergoing both velocity - dependent and position - dependent forces . considering gravity as dominant force for a axisymmetric system of particles , equations ( [ eq2 ] ) - ( [ eq5 ] ) reduce to the standard form of the jeans equations ( see equations 4.28 and 4.29 of @xcite ) .      in this subsection , by considering a steady axisymmetric system , we include the newtonian gravity of the black hole , the isotropic radiation pressure of the central source , and the drag force between the clouds and the ambient medium for the linear regime as the dominant forces .",
    "first we discuss about the role of radiation pressure and gravity and after that , through the analysis of the clouds near the midplane , we classify the distribution of the clouds in the blr .      assuming that the clouds are optically thick",
    ", the radiative force can be expressed as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the cloud s cross - section and the speed of the light respectively , and the isotropic radiation flux , @xmath59 , is @xmath60 @xmath61 is the bolometric luminosity of the central source and @xmath62 is the spherical radius . for the clouds near the midplane , @xmath63 , the radiative force per unit of mass can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the keplerian angular velocity in the midplane , @xmath66 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath67 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath68 is the eddington ratio , and @xmath69 is the column density of each cloud . following previous studies ,",
    "we consider the clouds , with conserved mass @xmath70 , in pressure equilibrium with the inter - cloud gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the pressure of the ambient medium , and hence the gas density in individual clouds , @xmath71 , are assumed to have a power - law dependence on the ( spherical ) distance from the centre as @xmath72 . as a result , since @xmath73 for the clouds near the midplane , the column density defined by @xmath74 finally becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 is one light day and @xmath77 is the column density at @xmath76 .",
    "in addition to the gravitational and radiative forces , the drag force opposing relative movement of clouds and the ambient gas is another force that needs to be taken into consideration .",
    "depending on the size of the clouds , there are two regimes for the drag force .",
    "these include the epstein and the stokes regimes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the epstein regime , which dominates for the small clouds , the magnitude of the force is proportional to the relative velocity . in the stokes regime the drag affecting the movement of the large clouds increases as the square of the relative velocity .",
    "we assume the clouds have spherical shapes , so the drag coefficient in the stokes regime depends solely on the reynolds number which is proportional to the relative velocity .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the reynolds number in the inter - cloud gas is lower than unity .",
    "this means that : ( 1 ) we can consider the inter - cloud gas as having a laminar flow and ( 2 ) the drag coefficient in the stokes regime is proportional to the inverse of the reynolds number ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the drag coefficient in the stokes regime is proportional to the inverse of relative velocity . as a result , in both the epstein and stokes regimes ,",
    "the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the relative velocity and both small and large clouds are affected by a linear drag force as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the velocity of the ambient medium and @xmath80 is the drag coefficient",
    ". the equations of motion of an individual cloud near the midplane are therefore given by    @xmath81-f_{l}(v_{r}-w_{r}),\\ ] ] @xmath82 @xmath83-f_{l}(v_{z}-w_{z}),\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the critical radius defined as @xmath85 from equations ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , we see that at @xmath86 , the attractive gravitational and repulsive radiative force cancel each other and the magnitude of the resultant force is equal to zero . for @xmath87 , the radiative force is stronger than gravity and accelerates the clouds away from the central black hole . for @xmath88 gravity",
    "overcomes the radiative force and pulls the clouds inwards .",
    "if we assume @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the value of @xmath94 almost becomes 27 light days which is in order of blr radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) . assuming a steady state and axisymmetry , we substitute equations ( [ eq10 ] ) into equations ( [ eq3 ] ) - ( [ eq5 ] ) to obtain     and a cloudy torus ( wind region ) for @xmath87 .",

    "there are now two questions : what is the geometric shape of the clumpy disc ? and is its thickness small compared to its radial sizes ? in this section , we will answer to these questions and explore the role of various physical parameters on the shape and thickness of the clumpy disc . according to equation ( [ eq24 ] ) we consider the curved surface @xmath177 as the boundary between the clumpy and non - clumpy regions . through plotting the scale height profile as a function of the radial distance in figure [ figure3 ]",
    "we show the geometric shape of the clumpy disc .    in figure [ figure3 ]",

    "panels a and b show the role of the central luminosity and black hole mass on the thickness of the clumpy disc respectively . from these",
    "we see that with an increase in the central luminosity , the disc thickness increases , and that an increase in the black hole mass leads to a decrease in thickness .",
    "this is because as @xmath68 increases , radiative pressure dominates and pushes the clouds away from the midplane .",
    "however , an increase in the black hole mass leads to an increase in the gravitational attraction pulling the clouds toward the midplane .",
    "panels c and d show that there is similar behaviour for @xmath166 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath178 . with increases in both of them",
    ", @xmath166 increases as well . figure ( [ figure3 ] ) also shows that , as suggested by some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the clumpy disc is flared ( bowl - shaped ) .",
    "the thickness of the clumpy disc is small compared to the radial size ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "this is important .    obviously , as the central luminosity declines ,",
    "the clouds exposed to this radiation reprocess less amount of energy . as a result",
    "the broad emission lines are weak in llagns . however , in addition to this , the small thickness of the clumpy disc results in a small solid angle being covered by the clumpy disc and this leads to little capture of the central radiation .",
    "the fraction of radiation captured is given by @xmath180 which is of the order of @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the solid angle covered by the clumpy disc and @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , all the clouds located in the blr of llagn can only receive @xmath184 of the central radiation which itself is in order of @xmath185 the eddington luminosity and this leads to the presence of very weak broad emission lines in the spectra of llagns . in the very lowest luminosity cases ( @xmath186 ) ,",
    "the small thickness of the clumpy disc together with the faintness of the central source can cause that the broad emission lines to fall below observational detection thresholds and this can explain the lack of detection of any broad emission lines in such faint objects .    figures [ figure4 ] , [ figure5 ] and [ figure6 ] respectively clarify the effect of @xmath68 , @xmath178 and @xmath187 on the surface number density @xmath188 and volume number density @xmath55 which are plotted versus the radius @xmath120 .",
    "in these three figures , the first panels present the behaviour of @xmath188 versus @xmath120 and the second panels show the variations of @xmath55 with radius at @xmath124 and @xmath125 light day ( lt - d ) .",
    "values of the fixed parameters are specified in the captions . in these figures ,",
    "the profiles of the surface number density show that most of the clouds are located in the outer parts of the blr .",
    "however the profiles of the volume number density are somewhat different . whilst in the midplane most of the clouds are close to the central black hole , at @xmath189 lt - d , the value of @xmath55 in the central parts is almost zero and with increasing the radius , it increases to a maximum and then , for larger radial distances @xmath55 gradually declines . at @xmath190 lt",
    "- d the behaviour of the curve is similar to that at @xmath191 lt - d but the peak of the curve moves towards radii .",
    "note that , by considering the positive correlation between @xmath192 and @xmath120 , there is no contradiction between the behaviour of @xmath188 and @xmath55 as a function of @xmath120 .",
    "panel 4a shows that as @xmath68 increases , the ratio of the clouds in the outer regions of the blr to those in the inner regions increases as well . on the other hand , by assuming strong coupling between the clouds and the ambient medium , we have @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that , with increasing of @xmath68 , the number of slowly moving clouds in the outer parts increases and the number of quickly - moving clouds in the inner parts is reduced . in other words , as obtained by @xcite , we expect that with increasing @xmath68 , the width of broad emission lines @xmath7 decreases .",
    "panel 4b shows that an increase in @xmath68 leads to the reduction in the number of the clouds near the midplane .",
    "this is because they are distributed to higher altitudes .",

    "finally the third panel shows that the value of @xmath10 is nearly between 1.4 to 1.8 .",
    "however , unlike two first panels , the slope of the curve in @xmath234 diagram is shallow for lower values of @xmath9 and steep for higher values .    from figure ( [ figure8 ] )",
    "we see that with increasing @xmath195 , @xmath178 and @xmath77 the value of the virial factor , @xmath10 , decreases and with increasing @xmath61 it increases .",
    "but we have to note that the range of variation of @xmath10 is so small ( of the order of 0.01 for the variation of @xmath235 and 0.001 for the variation of three other quantities ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath0 is relatively insensitive to the variation of @xmath61 , @xmath195 , @xmath178 and @xmath77 .",
    "the insensitive correlation between the virial factor and bolometric luminosity is in agreement with the results found by @xcite .",
    "they found that while cloud orbits are strongly affected by radiation pressure , there is a relatively small change in @xmath236 .",
    "this means that radiation pressure does not change the value of virial factor significantly .",
    "in this work , considering the clouds as a collisionless ensemble of particles , we employed the cylindrical form of jeans equations calculated in section 2 to describe a geometric model for their distributions in the blr .",
    "the effective forces in this study are the newtonian gravity of the black hole , the isotropic radiative force arisen from the central source and the drag force for linear regime . taking them into account we showed that there are three classes for blr configuration : ( a ) non disc ( b ) disc - wind ( c ) pure disc structure ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we also found that the distribution of blr clouds in the brightest quasars belongs to class a , in the dimmer quasars and brighter seyfert galaxies it belongs to class b , and in the fainter seyfert galaxies and all llagns ( liners ) it belongs to class c.    then we derived the virial factor , @xmath10 , for disc - like structures and found a negative correlation for @xmath0 as a function of the inclination angle , the width of broad emission line and z - component of the velocity dispersion .",
    "we also found @xmath4 for type1 agns and @xmath5 for type2 agns .",
    "moreover we saw that @xmath10 approximately varies from 0.5 to 6.5 for different values of @xmath7 and from 1.4 to 1.8 for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "we also indicated that @xmath10 does nt change significantly with the variations of bolometric luminosity , column density of each cloud , density index and @xmath237 and the maximum change in the value of @xmath10 is of order of 0.01 .    in introduction",
    ", we mentioned that since each group take a different sample of agns , they find different values for average virial factor , @xmath11 .",
    "however different values leads to significant uncertainties in the estimation of black hole mass .",
    "on the other hand , in this paper , we saw that @xmath10 significantly changes with the inclination angle @xmath233 and @xmath238 ( figure [ figure7 ] ) . therefore in order to have more accurate estimation for black hole mass , we suggest observational campaigns to divide a sample of objects into a few subsamples based on the value of @xmath233 and @xmath238 of objects and then determine the value of @xmath11 for each subsample separately",
    ". therefore we will have several values for @xmath11 . finally regarding the value of @xmath233 and @xmath238 of each object with unknown black hole mass",
    ", we use the appropriate value of @xmath11 in the virial theorem to have more accurate estimation of black hole mass .",

    "so the value of @xmath31 for sufficiently large velocities is equal to zero ( e.g. , @xcite ) and , due to the divergence theorem , the first term on the right side of equation ( [ eqa1 ] ) vanishes and we have @xmath243 on the other hand , we define the averaged parameter in the velocity space as @xmath244 where @xmath245 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath55 is the volume number density in position - place which is calculated by @xmath246 . integrating cbe in the velocity space , we have @xmath247 @xmath248 @xmath249 since the velocity components ( @xmath242 ) do nt depend on @xmath120 , @xmath250 and @xmath3 and also the range of velocities over which we integrate depends on neither time nor space , so the partial derivatives respect to both time ( @xmath251 ) and space ( @xmath252 ) in the first four terms on the left side of equation ( [ eqa3 ] ) are taken outside . also by using equation ( [ eqa2 ] ) for the fifth , sixth and seventh terms of equation ( [ eqa3 ] ) , the first relation of the jeans equations",
    "is gained as @xmath253 the derivation of other relations of the jeans equations is similar to that of the first one . by multiplying cbe by @xmath254 and @xmath255 respectively and integrating them in the velocity - space , other equations can be given by @xmath49 @xmath256 and @xmath51 @xmath257 and @xmath53 @xmath258",
    "in this part , we calculate the averaged line of sight velocity square .",
    "we assume that the central black hole is placed at the origin of our coordinates system and @xmath259 plane is the midplane of the blr . in this configuration , the velocity of the cloud placed at ( @xmath28 )",
