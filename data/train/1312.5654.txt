    "a dynamical system is _ finitely presented _ if it can be represented as the factor of a shift of finite type by an equivalence relation that is also a shift of finite type , see  @xcite . if we think of finite type as analogous to finite generation ( of a group or of a normal subgroup ) , then the notion of a finitely presented dynamical system becomes analogous to the notion of a finitely presented group . but",
    "the relation is deeper than just a superficial analogy .    condition of being finitely presented for a dynamical system is very closely related to dynamical hyperbolicity , see  @xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is a locally expanding self - covering of a compact metric space , then @xmath6 is finitely presented .",
    "dynamical hyperbolicity is very closely related to gromov hyperbolicity for groups , see  @xcite , and finite presentation is an important property of hyperbolic groups .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show a new connection between expanding maps and finite presentations .",
    "we naturally associate with every finite degree self - covering @xmath0 of a path - connected space @xmath7 a group @xmath1 with the following property ( see theorem  [ th : finitepresentation ] and theorem  [ th : classification ] ) .    [",
    "th : first ] if @xmath0 is a locally expanding self - covering of a compact path connected metric space then @xmath1 is finitely presented",

    "we also show that the commutator subgroup of @xmath1 is simple , and give a dynamical interpretation of the abelianization @xmath4 , see theorem  [ th : commutatorsimple ] and proposition  [ pr : homology ] .",
    "the groups @xmath1 are defined in the following way .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite degree covering map , and suppose that @xmath7 is path connected .",

    "its set of vertices is @xmath16 , and a vertex @xmath17 is connected to the vertex @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be its boundary , which can be defined as the inverse limit of the discrete sets @xmath20 with respect to the maps @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a path in @xmath7 connecting a vertex @xmath17 to a vertex @xmath23 of the tree @xmath14 .",
    "considering lifts of @xmath22 by the coverings @xmath24 , we get an isomorphism @xmath25 between subtrees @xmath26 of @xmath14 .",
    "namely , if @xmath27 is a lift of @xmath22 starting at @xmath28 , then @xmath29 is the end of @xmath27 .",
    "denote by the same symbol @xmath30 the induced homeomorphism @xmath31 of the boundaries of the subtrees , seen as clopen subsets of @xmath19 .",
    "the group @xmath1 is the group of all homeomorphisms @xmath32 locally equal to homeomorphisms of the form @xmath33 .",
    "the group @xmath1 is generated by the higman - thompson group @xmath34 ( see  @xcite ) acting on @xmath19 and the _ iterated monodromy group _ @xmath35 of @xmath0 .",
    "the iterated monodromy group can be defined as the subgroup of @xmath1 consisting of homeomorphism @xmath36 , where @xmath22 is a loop starting and ending at the basepoint @xmath15 .",
    "it is an invariant of the topological conjugacy class of @xmath0 , and it becomes a complete invariant ( in the expanding case ) , if we consider it as a _ self - similar group_. self - similarity is an additional structure on a group , and it can be defined using one of several equivalent approaches : virtual endomorphisms , wreath recursions , bisets , or structures of an automaton group . the fact that self - similar iterated monodromy group is a complete invariant of an expanding self - covering is one of the main topics of  @xcite .    from the point of view of group theory , @xmath1 seems to be a `` cleaner '' object , since no additional structure is needed to make it a complete invariant of a dynamical system . besides",
    ", it is finitely presented , unlike the iterated monodromy groups , which are typically infinite presented . however , iterated monodromy groups have better functorial properties than the groups @xmath1 , see  @xcite .",
    "a group @xmath37 , analogous to @xmath1 , can be defined for any self - similar group @xmath38 , so that @xmath39 .",
    "groups of this type were for the first time studied by c.  rver  @xcite .",
    "in particular , he showed that if @xmath38 is the grigorchuk group  @xcite , then @xmath37 is finitely presented , simple , and is isomorphic to the abstract commensurator of the grigorchuk group .",
    "the case of a general self - similar group @xmath38 was studied later in  @xcite .",
    "several natural questions arise in connection with theorem  [ th : first ] .",
    "for example , is the isomorphism problem solvable for the groups @xmath1 ?",
    "equivalently , is the topological conjugacy problem for expanding maps algorithmically solvable ?",
    "note that expanding maps can be given in different ways by a finite amount of information : using finite presentations in the sense of  @xcite , using combinatorial models in the sense of  @xcite , using iterated monodromy groups , e.t.c ..",
    "another natural question is whether the groups @xmath1 , similarly to the higman - thompson groups ( see  @xcite ) , satisfy the finiteness condition @xmath40 , i.e. , if they have classifying spaces with finite @xmath41-dimensional skeleta for all @xmath41",
    ". it would be also interesting to study homology of @xmath1 in relation with homological properties of the dynamical system .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in `` definition of the groups @xmath1 '' we give a review of terminology related to rooted trees , and define the groups @xmath1 . in the next section `` symbolic coding ''",
    "we encode the vertices of the tree of preimages @xmath14 by finite words over an alphabet @xmath42 , and show that @xmath1 contains a natural copy of the higman - thompson group , and that @xmath1 is generated by the higman - thompson group and the iterated monodromy group .",
    "we also give a review of the basic notions of the theory of self - similar groups , and define the groups @xmath37 associated with self - similar groups , following  @xcite .",
    "in section  4 we prove that the commutator subgroup @xmath43 of @xmath37 is simple for any self - similar group @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , @xmath44 is simple for any map @xmath6 .",
    "note that the fact that every proper quotient of @xmath37 is abelian , i.e. , that every non - trivial normal subgroup of @xmath37 contains @xmath43 was already proved in  @xcite , and we use this fact in our proof .",
    "later , in the next section we give an interpretation of @xmath4 in topological terms .",
    "namely , we prove the following ( see proposition  [ pr : homology ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath45 is expanding , @xmath7 is path - connected and semi - locally simply connected , and @xmath46 .    if @xmath47 is even , then @xmath4 is isomorphic to the quotient of @xmath48 by the range of the endomorphism @xmath49 .    if @xmath47 is odd , then @xmath4 is isomorphic to the quotient of @xmath50 by the range of the endomorphism @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "here @xmath53 is the homomorphism induced by the identical embedding @xmath54 , the homomorphism @xmath55 maps a cycle @xmath56 to its full preimage @xmath57 , and @xmath58 maps a cycle @xmath56 defined by a loop @xmath22 to @xmath59 if @xmath22 acts as an odd permutation on the fiber of @xmath6 , and to @xmath60 otherwise .",
    "the main result of section  5 is existence of finite presentation of @xmath1 when @xmath6 is expanding .",
    "more generally , we show that @xmath37 is finitely presented , if @xmath38 is a _ contracting self - similar group _ , see theorem  [ th : finitepresentation ] .",
    "we also give ( in subsection  5.2 ) a general definition of the groups @xmath1 for expanding maps @xmath0 ( where @xmath7 is not required to be path connected ) .",
    "section `` dynamical systems and groupoids '' is an overview of the theory of limit dynamical systems of contracting self - similar groups and basic results of hyperbolic groupoids , following  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "these results are needed for the proof the fact that @xmath1 is a complete invariant of the dynamical system in the expanding case , which is proved ( theorem  [ th : classification ] ) in the last section of the paper .",
    "the general scheme of the proof of theorem  [ th : classification ] is as follows .",
    "first , we show , using a theorem of m.  rubin  @xcite , that two groups @xmath2 and @xmath3 are isomorphic if and only if their actions on the corresponding boundaries of trees are topologically conjugate .",
    "this implies , that the groupoid of germs @xmath61 of the action of the group @xmath1 on the boundary of the tree is uniquely determined by the group @xmath1 .",
    "the groupoid @xmath61 is hyperbolic , and hence it uniquely determines the equivalence class of its dual ( see  @xcite ) , which is the groupoid generated by the germs of @xmath0 .",
    "it remains to show that the dynamical system @xmath0 is uniquely determined ( up to topological conjugacy ) by the equivalence class of the groupoid of germs generated by it . this is proved using the techniques of hyperbolic groupoids .",
    "connectedness of @xmath7 is used in the proof in an essential way .",
    "it is a natural question to ask if theorem  [ th : classification ] is true in general ( without the condition that @xmath7 is path connected ) .    as a corollary of the proof of theorem  [",
    "th : classification ] , we clarify the relation between the groupoid - theoretic equivalence of groupoids of germs associated with expanding dynamical systems , and their topological conjugacy , see theorem  [ th : groupoidequivalence ] .",
