    "<S> we show that a ferroelectric phase transition takes place in the incommensurate phase of the @xmath0 crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric character of the ic phase explains the second - harmonic generation observed in the corresponding temperature range .    </S>",
    "<S> the crystals of the @xmath1 family ( about 20 crystals ) @xcite undergo two successive phase transitions on cooling : an incommensurate ( ic ) transition at temperature @xmath2 with a modulation vector near the @xmath3 point in the brillouin zone , and upon further cooling at temperature @xmath4 a commensurate lock - in transition to the triple - period ferroelectric phase with the modulation vector @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking peculiarity of the @xmath0 crystal , which belongs to the @xmath1 family , is the second - harmonic generation ( shg ) in the ic phase,@xcite of the same intensity magnitude as that in the @xmath3- phase . </S>",
    "<S> low temperature @xmath3- phases of the @xmath1 type crystals are improper ferroelectrics , and therefore the shg is a normal manifestation of this feature . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far there was neither pointed out a plausible reason for the shg in the ic phase of @xmath0 , nor explained why it takes place not in all the crystals of the @xmath1 family . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the shg was observed also in the ic phase of quartz by dolino and bachheimer ( 1977)@xcite and in the ic phase of the ammonium fluoroberyllate @xmath5 by alexandrov et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1978)@xcite , and both observations also can be explained using the theory developed below . </S>",
    "<S> the attempt to explain the shg in the ic phase of @xmath5 was carried out by golovko and levanyuk@xcite based on the spatial dispersion of the dielectric constant . </S>",
    "<S> however , the expected effect appeared to be small , and besides , it is not explained why in such a case the shg is not observed in all the crystals with the ic phases .    in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that within the ic phase of the @xmath0 crystal , necessarily a transition to the ferroelectric ic phase takes place . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the exact solution in frame of the landau theory . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason for such a ferroelectric transition is the coupling between the crystal s polar symmetry vibrational mode @xmath6 and some displacements of the ic domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that relative displacements of the domain walls in the domainlike ic structure induce polarization along the @xmath7 direction , and can be viewed as an additional phonon branch of a polar symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is not explicitly introduced in the equations below . </S>",
    "<S> it is a component of the ic phase @xmath8 function , and is taken into account implicitly , in the integral form . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the two modes renormalizes the frequency of the lower mode down to zero within the ic range , which induces a ferroelectric transition .    </S>",
    "<S> structure of the ic modulation of @xmath0 was defined in the neutron diffraction by iizumi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.@xcite the thermodynamic potential describing the ic phase of @xmath9 was detailed studied by sannikov and levanyuk.@xcite for the two - component order parameter with components @xmath10 and @xmath11 it can be written as : @xmath12 where @xmath6 is polarization vector in the @xmath7 direction , @xmath13 is electric field in the @xmath7 direction . in case of @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> this potential would describe a phase transition from the symmetric high - temperature phase to the triple - period commensurate phase at the temperature @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath16 the equilibrium values of the modulation phase @xmath17 are @xmath18 ( otherwise @xmath19 ) . however , in virtue of the lifshitz invariant ( @xmath20 ) the phase transition takes place from the high - temperature phase to the ic phase at @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> substituting @xmath24 in potential ( 1 ) one obtains for the @xmath25- and @xmath6- dependent part of potential ( 1 ) the following expression : @xmath26 minimization of this expression with respect to @xmath25 gives the equation : @xmath27 after single integration over @xmath28 and taking for the integration constant the form @xmath29 one obtains : @xmath30 where @xmath31 . the integration constant @xmath32 , as well as the polarization vector @xmath6 , </S>",

    "<S> the solution to this kind of equations for the ic structures was analyzed in the pioneer work by dzyaloshinski @xcite ( it was also detailed studied by golovko@xcite ) , and for eq . ( 3 ) , it has the form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the _ elliptic amplitude function _ and @xmath36 is the ic vector at the temperature of the ic transition . </S>",

    "<S> ( 5a ) can be numerically solved with respect to @xmath32 for given coefficients @xmath39 , and one obtains that the parameter @xmath32 monotonously decreases from @xmath40 at @xmath41 ( i.e. , at the ic transition @xmath2 ) down to @xmath42 at the continuous lock - in transition @xmath43 . as it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5a ) , at the lock - in transition point the ic amplitude is tending to @xmath44    which gives that @xmath45 , if the remaining coefficients are of the same order of magnitude .    in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding graph must look like a straight line with slope @xmath36 ( @xmath49 , i.e. , sinusoidal modulation ) , and on cooling it acquires the domain - like features . due to the symmetry , each point @xmath28 on the curves of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) is associated with a nonzero polarization , which is spatially distributed as @xmath50 with zero - integral effect . </S>",

    "<S> respectively , giving rise to the @xmath6-s of opposite signs .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) the transformation of the curves of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) under the applied electric field @xmath53 is shown . </S>",
    "<S> the field @xmath53 is taken into account via replacing in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) of the polarization vector @xmath6 by @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> an identical transformation of the domains takes place in the presence of nonzero polarization @xmath6 in crystal ( when @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding solutions were found both analytically and numerically ( using the `` mathematica '' software ) with the same result . </S>",
    "<S> note that the integral polarization vector contributed by the nonequal domains in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) is not zero .    </S>",
    "<S> now we show , that the above described transformation of the domain structure from that shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) takes place spontaneously , i.e. , without applying an external electric field . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , there takes place a ferroelectric phase transition inside the ic phase . </S>",
    "<S> let us calculate the dielectric susceptibility of the crystal in the ic phase : @xmath56 differentiation of potential ( 2 ) gives : @xmath57 @xmath58 is the ic period , given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) below . in order to calculate the derivative @xmath59 , we introduce notation @xmath60 integration of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) gives in this notation , @xmath61 , from which follows that @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter allows one to calculate the derivative @xmath63 via calculation of the corresponding derivatives of the function @xmath64 in the integral form ( see the appendix ) . after substituting of the calculated derivative in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 ) , one obtains : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a _ </S>",
    "<S> hypergeometric function_. this hypergeometric function has the asymptotic @xmath67 which well fits the function in all the range @xmath68 , i.e. , not only at @xmath69 . as one can see from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 10 ) , the ic period has an asymptotic : @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( as shown below , on approaching the lock - in temperature @xmath43 the coefficient @xmath32 is tending to zero as @xmath71 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> so , for the susceptibility @xmath72 one obtains : @xmath73 and the stability coefficient @xmath74 necessarily vanishes ( since the @xmath32 -dependent term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 8) is negative and diverging with @xmath69 ) , inducing ferroelectric phase transition at the temperature @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> a loss of stability necessarily takes place even for the case of large @xmath76 ( i.e. , even for a not soft polar mode of the high temperature phase ) , and it is expected in the medium temperature range of the ic phase ( @xmath77 ) </S>",
    "<S> .    however , some alternative situations are possible near the loss of stability @xmath75 . as it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , the polarization @xmath6 which appears below the transition should be sufficiently small : @xmath78 otherwise , the expression under the root in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) takes negative values for some @xmath17 , what means that the crystal does not fall within the ic phase , but within the commensurate lock - in phase instead , skipping the ferroelectric ic phase . in terms of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , it is equivalent to the infinite increasing of the one domain s size , which covers all of the crystal area . the right hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) is very small , since @xmath79 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) is a small parameter , and @xmath32 tends to zero in the low - temperature range of the ic phase ( see also below ) . in the case of a first - order ferroelectric phase transition giving rise to a large @xmath6 ( in landau theory , </S>",
    "<S> it means a negative fourth - order term in the potential s @xmath6- expansion ) , inequality ( 9 ) does not hold , and the transition transfers the crystal directly to the lock - in phase , skipping the ferroelectric ic phase . </S>",
    "<S> even for some order - disorder transitions , which are very close to the second - order type ( the polarization vector @xmath6 below the order - disorder transitions is larger , due to the small curie constant compared to that for the displacement type ) the expected ferroelectric transition is more likely to turn into the transition to the lock - in phase , skipping the ferroelectric ic phase . </S>",
    "<S> note that among the crystals of the @xmath1 family only @xmath0 is of a displacement type , and therefore for this crystal the ferroelectric phase transition ( from the ic to the ferroelectric ic phase ) can be considered as a most likely . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the ic structure of @xmath0 becomes ferroelectric with the modulation , spatially distributed like that in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> one should expect that the ferroelectric transition takes place in the beginning of the domainlike modulation formation , i.e. , at temperatures near the curve i in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , when the @xmath32 coefficient falls below unity .    </S>",
    "<S> as it follows from eqs.(5a , 5b ) , for estimates of inequality ( 9 ) , the asymptotic of the parameter @xmath69 can be used : @xmath80 near the lock - in point we presented @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is some constant . </S>",
    "<S> so , eq . ( 9 ) can be presented as @xmath83 , when @xmath84 ( we neglected a logarithmically diverging term @xmath85 , which does not change order of magnitude of the estimated values , since , as discussed below , @xmath86 can not be sufficiently small for it ) .    for obtaining of the inharmonic fourth order term in the @xmath6 expansion of the potential one should calculate the derivative @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> we shall introduce here only the result of this calculation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the @xmath88 term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , one obtains a negative , strongly diverging as @xmath89 with @xmath69 term . </S>",
    "<S> if the sum of the inharmonic @xmath90 terms becomes negative earlier than @xmath75 , then takes place a first - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> the latter makes more probable the first order transition , even if the coefficient @xmath91 is not small .    </S>",
    "<S> now we shall discuss some features of the ic phase for @xmath33 case in order to compare it with behavior of the ferroelectric ic phase . </S>",
    "<S> to study the temperature evolving of the ferroelectric ic structure upon cooling one should minimize potential ( 2 ) also over the ic amplitude @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we imply in the present paper only increasing of the ic amplitude @xmath92 upon cooling , and do not discuss the character of the lock - in transition .    </S>",
    "<S> first we discuss some structure peculiarities of the non - ferroelectric ic phase of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the length of each plateau in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) is six times shorter than the ic wavelength @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the ic wavevector [ @xmath94 is equal to the average slope of the given curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] . from this geometrical fact </S>",
    "<S> it follows , that the ic modulation argument @xmath31 can be presented as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a periodic function with period @xmath97 . as it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) , roughly @xmath96 can be approximated by @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the ic satellite reflections observed in the x - ray diffraction are induced by the fourier - components of the modulation function @xmath99 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ic satellites observed for such a modulation should appear in the points @xmath100 ; @xmath101 near the main bragg- reflections @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the manifestation of the domain - like ic structure in @xmath0 in diffraction should be only the simultaneous observation of the ic satellites of about the same intensity ( asymmetrically disposed with respect to the @xmath103 point ) in the points @xmath104 and @xmath105 near @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> intensive ic satellites in the points @xmath107 , which are observed in diffraction , are not contributed by the domain features of the modulation , and can not be viewed as a manifestation of a domainlike ic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the satellites @xmath104 and @xmath105 were not observed for @xmath0 , which proves that the domainlike structure is not well developed in @xmath0 , and the ferroelectric phase exists only in the medium range of the ic phase . </S>",
    "<S> so , as it follows from the exact solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , any crystal of the @xmath1 type with well developed ic domain structure ( i.e. , sufficiently small @xmath32 ) should be ferroelectric . </S>",
    "<S> the ferroelectric transition does not change the translation symmetry of the ic phase , and therefore the satellites disposition for the ferroelectric ic phase should not essentially differ from that for the @xmath33 case .    </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the character of increasing of the ic modulation period on cooling , which is logarithmically diverging , as it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ic period for the modulation given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the _ complete elliptic integral of the first kind_. with @xmath69 the function @xmath110 has the asymptotic @xmath111 and @xmath112 which is logarithmically diverging . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature @xmath113 can approach the lock - in temperature @xmath43 not closer than the temperature fluctuation @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the crystal volume and @xmath117 is the heat capacity . </S>",
    "<S> so , for any crystal of a finite size ( @xmath118 ) , the period @xmath119 can increase only about 10 times compared to @xmath120 , in virtue of the logarithmical character of the divergence ( it is also confirmed by our numerical simulations ) . besides , in the real experiment the temperature @xmath113 can not approach the lock - in temperature @xmath43 even closer than the instrumental temperature resolution @xmath121 , which does not allow to observe any diverging ic period , and the lock - in transition always should be observed as a discontinuous phase transition with jump in the wavevector @xmath94 down to @xmath122 .    for calculation of the ferroelectric ic modulation s period [ the @xmath28-length of the six neighboring domains in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] , one should integrate eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) from @xmath123 through @xmath124 , which gives : @xmath125    @xmath126\\;\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath127 is the _ </S>",

    "<S> . the parameter @xmath130 decreases down to zero with increasing of the polarization vector @xmath6 on cooling . </S>",
    "<S> integral ( 11 ) was calculated exactly , and after being simplified to the form of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) for @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) , which gives the size of the larger domains in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , is diverging with @xmath132 as @xmath133 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the size of the smaller domains is given by the second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 12 ) , and it is always finite , though it also increases with cooling .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , we showed that in the ic phase of the @xmath9 crystal takes place ferroelectric phase transition , which explains the shg in the ic phase of this crystal . </S>",
    "<S> formation of the ferroelectric ic phase is most likely near the displacement - type phase transitions , though it can occur also in those of the order - disorder type . </S>",
    "<S> the ic period increases on cooling towards the lock - in temperature @xmath43 as @xmath134 , though the size of the domains , polarized opposite to the prevailing polarization , remains finite . </S>"
