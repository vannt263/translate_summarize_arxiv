    "@xmath186 is determined by finding the minimum in the line energy , and is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath2 .",
    "the behavior of the chain state is subtly different from that of the single flux line .",
    "the main effects are the same , _",
    "i.e. _ for large anisotropy there exist a range of angles over which the chains can not be orientated , but the details are more complicated .",
    "the chain state is stable for small anisotropies , but for large anisotropies the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath2 once again becomes nonmonotonic . for this to occur it requires a larger anisotropy than for the single flux line .",
    "12 shows @xmath187 just after the onset of nonmonotonicity for isolated flux lines . the chain state has no restriction on the orientation of the flux lines , unlike the single flux line , and",
    "also the chain state always has a lower ( or equal ) lower critical field @xmath152@xcite , see fig .",
    "13 .    increasing the anisotropy , fig .",
    "14 , the chain state eventually shows signs of instabilities .",
    "initially @xmath187 becomes nonmonotonic at large tilt angles , @xmath188 , and the chains are excluded over the range @xmath189 .",
    "this occurs for @xmath190 and @xmath7 contains a kink in a manner similar to the single flux line .",
    "however , for @xmath191 , @xmath187 is also nonmonotonic at smaller angles , @xmath192 .",
    "this implies the chains are also excluded over a different range @xmath193 . from @xmath148 , fig .",
    "15 , it can be seen that a stable range @xmath194 exists between these two forbidden regions .",
    "the lower critical field @xmath7 now has two kinks .",
    "as the anisotropy is increased further these excluded regions grow until at @xmath195 the chain state is excluded over the whole range @xmath196 .",
    "the second kink in @xmath7 disappears , fig . 16 , and only one",
    "kink remains . for @xmath119 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the elastic instabilities again only occur when @xmath200 .",
    "these instabilities have slightly different properties at small @xmath2 and large @xmath2 . at large @xmath2",
    "the lattice is most unstable to a tilt - wave instability @xmath13 while it is a staircase wave instability , with @xmath127 and @xmath6 both non - zero , that causes the chain to become unstable at smaller @xmath2 .",
    "again , these instabilities only occur in the forbidden regions , and the chain state is stable at all allowed orientations .",
    "we have investigated the presence of instabilities in the flux line lattice in anisotropic superconductors using london theory .",
    "there are limitations on the applicability of the london theory , but the wavevectors at which the instabilities appear are well within its limits of validity , _ i.e. _ @xmath201 .    due to the anisotropy",
    "induced attractive flux line interaction , the form of the equilibrium flux line lattice has to be determined numerically at all fields .",
    "there is a smooth crossover from a large field abrikosov - like state to the low field chain - like state .",
    "the nature of the instabilities observed in this equilibrium lattice is not complex . at large fields it is stable . as the field",
    "is reduced , at a particular field @xmath121 some of the normal modes of the elasticity matrix become unstable .",
    "this field depends on the anisotropy @xmath1 and the angle @xmath2 at which the flux lines are orientated to the crystal @xmath3-axis .",
    "the instability is characterized by always having finite @xmath127 and @xmath6 , and we call this a staircase wave instability to distinguish it from a tilt wave instability which is defined as an instability which depends only on @xmath6 . there is a minimum anisotropy required before these instabilities are observed .",
    "this depends on @xmath15 and for @xmath116 the instabilities were seen for @xmath117 , but this was increased to @xmath202 for @xmath119 .",
    "this may indicate why the bitter patterns observed on ybco are different from those on bscco .    as the component of @xmath73 along the flux lines is non - zero",
    ", the choice of cutoff is crucial .",
    "we have used the cutoff suggested by sudband brandt , where @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "this cutoff appears more physical than a cutoff that just depends on @xmath76 and allows the elastic instabilities and the nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath187 to be related to a single quantity , the line tension @xmath205 , as expected .",
    "however , it should be noted there are still problems associated with this cutoff in the limit @xmath206 . once in the region",
    "where @xmath6 forces @xmath207 , the elasticity matrix ( [ elasticitymatrix ] ) will be dominated by @xmath208 .",
    "while @xmath209 is zero , the eigenvalues of the elasticity matrix are negative , showing london theory is always unstable at all fields and angles .",
    "however , these instabilities occur at values of @xmath210 and are unphysical .",
    "the inclusion of core effects , _",
    "e.g. _ core bending energy , may remove remove this instability , but this is outside the domain of validity of the london approximation .",
    "instabilities can also be observed by investigating the lower critical field @xmath152 , _ i.e. _ @xmath112 .",
    "these @xmath112 instabilities are different from the large field staircase wave instabilities . when the applied field @xmath132 is tilted away from the crystal axis , the @xmath9-field and the applied field @xmath132 are not parallel . in section",
    "[ sec : angle ] it was seen that for small fields and large anisotropies there existed a nonmonotonic relationship between the angle @xmath2 at which the @xmath9-field is tilted away from the @xmath3-axis , and the angle @xmath8 at which the applied field is tilted .",
    "the nonmonotonicity is related to the elastic instabilities observed , but also imply there is a restriction on the allowed orientations of the @xmath9-field and a kink in @xmath7 .",
    "the properties of the chain state changes at three different values of the anisotropy . for @xmath211 , all possible orientations of the chain state",
    "are possible , while in the interval @xmath212 the chains can not be orientated over the range @xmath189 . however , if @xmath213 the flux lines are excluded over two separate regions which grow to one large region for @xmath214 .",
    "this unusual behavior can also be described as @xmath7 developing one kink at @xmath215 , a second kink developing at @xmath216 but @xmath7 only having a single kink for @xmath217 .    whether the peculiar effect of having the allowed orientations @xmath194 between two forbidden regions really exists is unclear .",
    "just as the existence of the forbidden region @xmath218 for the isolated flux lines in section [ sec : angle ] may have been an indicator of a state with a lower free energy and applied field @xmath152 , there may exist a new composition of flux lines that will be stable at large anisotropies and have a lower free energy and applied field @xmath152 than the chain state .",
    "this may be a completely new state or a superposition of chain states and other flux lines , but a full investigation of such states is left for future work .",
