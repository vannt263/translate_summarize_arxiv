    "the peak magnitudes of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are one of the best distance indicators at high redshifts , where few reliable distance indicators are available to study the cosmological parameters . beginning with the discovery of sn 1992bi @xcite ,",
    "the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) has developed search techniques and rapid analysis methods that allow systematic discovery and follow up of `` batches '' of high - redshift supernovae .",
    "these searches and those of the high - z sn team have resulted in @xmath1 published sne ( @xmath2 ) , which have been used for measurements of the cosmological parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 and to provide initial constraints on the equation of state of the universe , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "spectra have been obtained for as many of the scp supernovae as possible , and as close as possible to maximum light .",
    "the spectra are used to determine the redshift of the event and to confirm its spectral sub - type , both crucial if the supernova is to be used in a determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition the spectra provide a check that sne  ia at high redshift are similar to those at low redshift , an assumption central to the use of sne  ia as ` standardized candles ' .",
    "this paper represents a significant contribution to the amount of published high - redshift sn ia spectroscopy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present spectra for a subset of our distant supernovae , discovered during search campaigns in january and march 1997 .",
    "since the goal of this paper is a first quantitative comparison of high- and low - redshift sn spectra , spectra were chosen where the sn features were relatively clear .",
    "spectra of 33 objects were taken during the two campaigns , of which four were found to be clear broad - lined qsos and two were `` featureless '' blue objects ( possibly bl lacs ) for which a redshift could not be measured .",
    "the other objects all have measured redshifts and of these about half ( 13 ) were rejected for the purposes of this paper based on one or both of the following criteria : low signal - to - noise ratio ( i.e. less than about 10 per 20  bin over the observed wavelength range 6000 - 8000 ) or large contamination by the host galaxy , roughly corresponding to a percentage increase of less than 50% in @xmath6-band photometry between reference and `` new '' images ( although the latter is only a rough guide since the phase of the sn , its location relative to the core of the galaxy and the seeing all strongly affect how clearly the sn appears in the spectrum ) .",
    "the spectra presented here provide the basis for the identification of these objects as type ia , as quoted in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "future papers by g. garavini et al . and e. smith et al .",
    "will present spectroscopic results and analysis on other scp datasets .",
    "for each object in our sample we give the redshift and present the results of matching the spectrum to various supernova templates ( including sne of types other than ia ) , and hence give spectroscopic evidence that these distant supernovae are of type ia .",
    "the spectral dates derived from this matching process are compared with the dates derived from the light curves .",
    "finally we present the set of high - redshift sn spectra as a time sequence showing that the spectrum changes with light curve phase in a similar way at low and high redshift .",
    "the observing strategy developed for these high - redshift sn search runs involved comparison of large numbers of galaxies in each of @xmath750 @xmath8 fields observed twice with a separation of 34 weeks @xcite .",
    "this strategy ensures that almost all the supernovae are discovered before maximum light , and , since it could be guaranteed that at least a dozen supernovae would be found on a given search run , the follow - up observing time could be scheduled in advance .",
    "this strategy made it possible to schedule spectroscopy time on large telescopes while the supernovae were still close to maximum light , and thus the supernova features can be observed even at redshifts @xmath91 .",
    "follow - up photometric measurements were also made of the supernova light - curves , from which the maximum brightness and date of maximum is derived .",
    "the supernovae described in this paper were identified on @xmath6-band images taken in two searches on the ctio 4-m blanco telescope in january and march 1997 .",
    "candidate supernovae were identified on the difference images ( see @xcite for details on the identification of candidates ) .",
    "those supernovae identified as type ia were followed photometrically in the @xmath6- and @xmath10-bands at the wiyn telescope at kpno , the eso 3.6 m and one ( sn 1997ap ) was followed with the _ hubble space telescope _ @xcite .",
    "parameterised light - curve fits for all but one of the objects presented in this paper ( sn 1997ag , which does not have sufficient photometric light curve measurements for cosmological use ) are published in @xcite . these sne form part of the set that provided the first evidence for the accelerating expansion of the universe and the presence of some form of dark energy driving this expansion",
    "many of these objects ( but excluding sn  1997ag , sn  1997 g , sn  1997j and sn  1997s because of poor colour measurements , @xmath11 ) were also used in the more recent measurements of cosmological parameters by @xcite .",
    "the spectra were obtained during two observing runs at the keck - ii 10-m telescope ( two nights in january and three in march 1997 ) and one run at the eso 3.6 m ( 1 night in january 1997 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic runs were scheduled to occur within one week of the corresponding search run at ctio . at the time of observations , close to maximum light",
    ", the typical magnitudes of the supernova candidates were 22 - 24 magnitude in @xmath6-band and in many cases their host galaxies had similar apparent magnitudes . in all cases where the galaxy was bright enough ,",
    "the slit was aligned at a position angle on the sky such that the supernova and the center of the host galaxy were both in the slit .",
    "this was done to allow redshift determination from features in the host galaxy spectrum .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standards hd84937 , hd19445 and bd262606 @xcite were taken at keck - ii , and ltt 1788 @xcite was observed at eso , in order to obtain approximate relative flux calibration of the spectra .",
    "the standards were observed at the parallactic angle , although note that the sn spectra were not necessarily taken at the parallactic angle as described above .",
    "although the effects of atmospheric dispersion are small when observing in the red ( as is the case for these spectra ) , some small wavelength - dependent slit losses may occur .",
    "therefore the overall slope of the spectra is not considered to be reliable and the slope is left as a free parameter in the analysis that follows .

    "typical exposure times were 0.5 to 1.5 hours .    during the january run",
    ", dome flats were taken at the position of targets when possible .",
    "this was necessary because flexure causes the fringe pattern to shift depending on the zenith distance and rotator angle .",
    "previous tests showed that dome flats gave marginally better results compared to internal flats when trying to subtract sky lines at the red end of the spectrum . during the march run ,",
    "bad weather and technical problems severely limited the amount of usable time . therefore , to allow us to observe all the candidates , the exposure times for each object were reduced and only internal flats were taken .",

    "the supernova was sufficiently offset from the core of its host galaxy that it was possible to extract the supernova spectrum and that of the host galaxy separately .",
    "in other cases it was only possible to extract a single spectrum containing a mix of supernova and host galaxy light . these spectra were then wavelength calibrated and flux calibrated . except where otherwise stated explicitly , a correction for atmospheric absorption features was made .",

    "the weighting function was set to be unity across the spectrum except at the telluric features , which were given zero weight .",
    "this equation is iterated over a range of redshifts to find the minimum @xmath22 in redshift , host galaxy , template supernova , and reddening space . in this analysis , the reddening law ( @xcite )",
    "was fixed at @xmath23 , although the spectrum matching code can handle other values of @xmath24 .",

    "@xcite make the case that , while slow - declining , spectroscopically peculiar sne like sn 1991 t and sn 1999aa represent 20% of sne discovered in volume - limited local surveys , they are strangely absent from high - redshift sn samples .",

    "the authors present one possible solution  that these sne become spectroscopically normal with time , and they appear normal by the time spectra are taken .",

    "since the spectrum was taken approximately 10 rest - frame days after maximum light , by which time sn 1991 t itself appears to be fairly spectroscopically normal , there is no definitive spectroscopic evidence that sn  1997am is a peculiar type ia , but it can not be ruled out . in the other case ,",

    "the stretch of sn  1997n is @xmath130 , somewhat lower than that of sn  1991 t .",

    "garavini et al .",
    "( in preparation ) have found definitive evidence for a sn 1991t - like supernova at high redshift . in that case",
    "the spectrum was taken 7 days before maximum when the spectral peculiarities are more evident .    the explanation for the supposed dearth of sn 1991t - like sne at high redshift proposed by li et al .",
    "( that they are in the data set , but appear spectroscopically normal when spectra are taken ) appears to be part of the answer to the paradox , although the situation may be more complicated . these sne may not be as consistently over - luminous as first thought @xcite , thus @xcite may have over - predicted the expected numbers in a flux - limited survey .    at the other extreme , spectroscopically peculiar under - luminous sne like sn 1991bg @xcite and sn 1999by @xcite",
    "have not been seen at high redshift . while it is unlikely that these sne will be found in flux - limited searches , it is also possible that these sne are from such an old stellar population that they do not exist at @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "while the depth of absorption lines gives some information about the quantity of an ion in a sn , the velocity of the line gives information about the ion s distribution within the photosphere .",
    "furthermore , the velocity of the supernova ejecta is related to the overall kinetic energy of the event .",
    "the kinetic energy has a direct influence on the opacities and hence on the total brightness of the supernova and its light - curve shape .    in figure  [ ca2vel ]",
    "we present a plot of the velocities of the minima for the scp high - redshift supernovae compared with two well - observed nearby supernovae .",
    "we note that while the absorption feature at 3700  is dominated by , and various ionization states of the iron - peak elements ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also contribute .",
    "for the three lowest redshift supernovae in the scp set , the feature is outside the observed wavelength range .",
    "therefore this analysis is restricted to the scp supernovae with @xmath134 .",
    "the analysis was performed on the spectra after galaxy subtraction had been done if this was necessary ( as described in the previous section ) .",
    "the velocities were estimated by fitting a gaussian function to the region 3610  to 3870  in the rest frame , followed by a second iteration using the region from -65  to + 100  either side of the previous estimate of the minimum .",
    "the velocity shift was calculated from the wavelength of the minimum by assuming a rest frame wavelength for this feature of 3945.28 .",
    "the same analysis was done on a spectral series for the normal type  ia sn1992a @xcite .",
    "finally the published velocities for the normal type  ia supernova 1989b @xcite are also shown .",
    "the general trend of decreasing velocities as a function of time and the range in velocities at a given epoch seen in the data is completely consistent with the range seen in nearby observations . this result",
    "is confirmed by garavini et al .",
    "( in preparation ) in a more recent independent set of high - redshift sn spectra .",
    "our high - redshift data is also broadly consistent with the recent study of nearby sne by @xcite , although the comparison is complicated by the fact that benetti et al .",
    "measure velocities whereas we consider velocities . taking into account the apparent offset between the two",
    "( as can be seen from sn  1992a and sn  1989b for example ) , the velocities seen in our high - redshift sample ( including the large value for sn  1997f ) are broadly consistent with the range of velocities seen in nearby sne . because of the larger error bars at high redshift , and only having a single velocity measurement per sn , it is not possible to determine into which of the @xcite classes each of our objects would fall .",
    "at the present time , the statistical and systematic errors in the measurement of the cosmological parameters from type ia supernovae are of similar size .",
    "as the quality and quantity of high - redshift supernova observations grows it will become even more important to constrain the systematic uncertainties . non - ia contamination and evolution are two of the larger potential systematics we currently face .",
    "here we have presented some of the methods we employ to reduce / study these uncertainties .    in this paper",
    "we have presented spectra for 14 high - redshift supernovae and demonstrated that the spectra are consistent with type ia . in three cases at intermediate redshift ( sn  1997ac , sn  1997ai and sn  1997am at @xmath135 ) in addition to two at lower redshift ( sn  1997i and sn  1997n ) we have observed the 6150feature and",
    "hence have unambiguously identified the sn as type ia . for higher redshifts",
    "this feature becomes increasingly difficult to observe as fringing and poor ccd response in the red , and bright oh lines in the sky background makes the spectra very noisy redward of @xmath136 .",
    "here we have used spectral matching combined with the identification of specific spectral features to identify the objects as sn  ia , the most important being the identification of features near 4000 .",
    "we have carried out first - order quantitative tests to compare the high - redshift spectra with their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "we show that the spectral phase determined from spectral matching to low - redshift type ia spectra is in very good agreement with the phase determined from the high - redshift light curve .",
    "similarly the spectral time series shows the same overall trends at low and high redshift . finally , quantitative measurements of the calcium ejection velocity in the high - redshift spectra are also consistent with those measured from the spectra of low - redshift branch - normal type ia sne .",
    "therefore we have found no evidence for evolution in the population of type ia sne up to redshifts of @xmath137 . while we can not prove that all sne ia at high redshift are identical to their low - redshift counterparts , we can say that it is possible to choose a set of high - redshift sne ia that are equivalent to low - redshift counterparts to within the accuracy of these quantitative tests .    with larger samples , such as those now being collected by the supernova legacy survey ( snls , @xcite ) and the essence project ( @xcite and references therein ) it will be possible to make more detailed comparisons in smaller redshift bins in the range @xmath138 and in subsets based on light curve stretch , galaxy host type and other factors",
    ". such studies will provide further confidence in the use of sne  ia as distance indicators , and , in cases where quantitative measurements of spectral features are found to correlate with luminosity or light curve stretch ( e.g. @xcite ) , these can be used to reduce scatter in the hubble diagram and thus improve the precision to which cosmological parameters may be measured .",
