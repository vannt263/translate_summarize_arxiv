    "traditionally , the aim of classical control methods in chaotic systems has been to lock the dynamics into a specific steady state or periodic orbit ( see for instance @xcite .",
    "but there has arisen a need for other approaches because there have appeared many situations where chaos could be a powerful attribute . in mechanics , for example , chaos helps prevent undesirable resonances @xcite . in engineering ,",
    "the thermal pulse combustor is more efficient in the chaotic regime @xcite . in living organisms ,",
    "chaotic dynamics in vital functions can make the difference between health and disease @xcite . in biology , it has been suggested that the disappearance of chaos may be the signal of pathological behavior @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "chaos is a desirable property that is worth preserving .",
    "however , sometimes the chaotic behavior is only transient in nature , and it is necessary to apply external perturbations to keep trajectories in the transient chaotic regime .",
    "transient chaos is a characteristic dynamical behavior that occurs in a certain region of phase space , where chaotic orbits exist for a while , before escaping to an external attractor .",
    "this kind of behavior can be found in a broad variety of systems like the periodically driven @xmath0 laser @xcite , voltage collapse in electrical power systems @xcite , or the mcann - yodzis ecological model @xcite , among many others .    from a topological point of view",
    ", transient chaos is caused by the presence of a chaotic saddle in phase space .",
    "a chaotic saddle can arise as a parameter is varied , when a chaotic attractor collides with the boundary of its own basin of attraction , causing a * boundary crisis*. then the chaotic attractor disappears , allowing the trajectories to escape to an external attractor . in many situations",
    ", the external attractor may be an undesirable dynamical state .",
    "for example , in the context of ecology @xcite , the escape may result in the extinction of some species , while in the cancer model described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics evolves towards a state where an undesirable growth of tumor cells occurs .    with the aim of avoiding the undesirable escapes ,",
    "different control methods have been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "these methods have been mainly designed to be applied in deterministic systems .",
    "however , when we are implementing some control method in a real system , the presence of disturbances may be unavoidable and must be considered , especially when it is necessary to keep the control as small as possible .",
    "methods that perform well in systems in absence of disturbances can fail dramatically when disturbances appear . for this reason ,",
    "it is reasonable to consider a term , that we call * disturbance * , that encloses all the uncertainty affecting the dynamics of the system , like modeling mismatches , finite precision in the measure of initial conditions or even systematic or random external disturbances .     +    to reduce the amount of control necessary to avoid escapes in a transient chaotic system in the presence of disturbances , a control method called * partial control * has been proposed in refs .",
    "this method is based on finding certain set in the phase space , which allows to avoid the escape of the trajectories .",
    "indeed the control idea , based on controlled set invariance , is pretty standard ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , however no partial control works have appeared in the control literature .",
    "this method consider that the trajectories are affected by a bounded disturbance , and then a bounded control is applied .",
    "both ideas , the control constraint and the application after a perturbation is not new in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless the use of sets to control transient chaotic systems affected by disturbances remains unexplored until now .",
    "the shape of the invariant sets play an important role in the dynamics of the controlled system @xcite .",
    "this situation is even stronger in the case of partial control , where the invariant set can be rather complex and it is only possible to find it using a numerical algorithm @xcite . in fig .  [ 0 ] an example of a set computed for the lorenz system",
    "the remarkable features of this method is that is able to use a control smaller than the disturbances affecting the system .",
    "in addition , the partially controlled dynamics remains chaotic , preserving the natural dynamics of the system .",
    "the method was successfully applied to several paradigmatic systems like the hnon map and the duffing oscillator @xcite , as well as other models in the context of ecology , cancer dynamics or economy @xcite .",
    "the partial control method is applied to maps , so that when we want to apply it to ordinary differential equations , a suitable time discretization of the continuous dynamics is needed to obtain a discrete time map .",
    "there exists a wide literature in nonlinear dynamics where the control is applied in a discrete way to continuous systems to suppress a chaotic behavior .",
    "for example , refs .",
    "@xcite describe two different experimental setups where a continuous system is controlled using a discrete time controller .",
    "different discretization techniques are possible , as for example , cutting the flow with a poincar section , or taking successive maxima ( or minima ) of the time series of a certain variable .",
    "alternatively , it could also be useful in applying the control at certain predefined values of time , as in the case of medical treatments based on periodic interventions . in this sense",
    ", we propose a way to build this kind of map using a time - discretization technique . with this approach it will be possible to control the system with a fixed time interval , which can be an advantage in many real applications .",
    "with the aim of showing how this method works in a flow affected by some disturbance , we have chosen the paradigmatic lorenz system for a choice of parameters where transient chaos appears and escapes occur .",
    "to apply the control method , we consider three different ways to discretize the dynamics of the flow taking into account how the disturbance in the flow appears in the map .",
    "first , a 1d ( one - dimensional ) map is built taking successive maxima of one of the variables .",
    "next , a 2d ( two - dimensional ) map is obtained from a poincar section .",
    "finally , in the third case a 3d ( three - dimensional ) map is built from a time - discretization of the flow . in all these cases",
    "we show how the partial control method is implemented ( the codes are available in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the procedure considered here can be applied in a similar way to a wide variety of systems found in the literature , where the goal is to avoid the escapes associated with a transient chaotic dynamics .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section @xmath1 is devoted to a general description of the partial control method . in section @xmath2 , we apply the method to the lorenz system , demonstrating the application of partial control in dimensions 1 , 2 and 3 , ( paying special attention to the novel 3d case ) and highlighting the pros and cons of the extra dimensions . finally , some conclusions are drawn in section @xmath3 .",
    "the partial control method is a recently developed control strategy for preventing escapes associated with a transient chaotic region in systems affected by disturbances .",
    "it is particulary appropriate when it is desirable to keep the magnitude of the control small .",
    "the method is based on the existence of certain sets , known as _ safe sets _ , which are used for steering the trajectory with small controls so that escapes can be avoided .",
    "in addition , the chaotic behavior of the dynamics is preserved .",
    "this control method is applied on maps , so in the case of flows affected by disturbances , it is necessary to previously discretize the dynamics .",
    "we consider here , that the discrete dynamics can be modeled as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an additive term representing the disturbance , which we assume to be bounded by some @xmath6 .",
    "for the controller , the observable is @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "the controller can not measure @xmath8 or @xmath5 separately in the real time application of the control .    in the partial control method the control variables are the same variables of the system .",
    "but we do not have a full control of what happens with those variables .",
    "we assume that we only apply a discrete control every @xmath9 .",
    "to relate the control in the map with the control in the physical continuous time model , we assume that the control is applied almost instantly in the flow , that is , we assume that the time spent to perturb the trajectory is much lower than the typical time variation of the dynamics .",
    "the control scheme is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents the applied control that we also consider to be bounded by some @xmath12 .",
    "one of the main achievements of this method is the relationship between the value of disturbance @xmath6 and the value of control @xmath12 .",
    "if we have @xmath13 , it would be trivial to have the control overpower the disturbance .",
    "however our goal is not to determine the trajectory , but only to prevent the escapes , and surprisingly , it is possible by using @xmath14 , which is rather counterintuitive .    to apply the method , we initially have to identify a region @xmath15 in phase space with transient chaos .",
    "trajectories in @xmath15 follow the chaotic dynamics and eventually escape from @xmath15 to an external attractor .",
    "the goal is to keep the dynamics @xmath4 within the region @xmath15 , and the partially controlled trajectories must satisfy the condition @xmath16 . on the left side of fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , we display an example of the dynamics in the region @xmath17 .",
    "some points may need a big control to return to @xmath18 , and therefore we remove them to preserve only the set of points that need only a small control bigger than some selected @xmath12 .",
    "following this idea , it is possible to numerically find a limiting set @xmath19 , where all the @xmath20 can be kept . in a formal way",
    ", we will say that @xmath21 is a * safe set * for the specified @xmath6 and @xmath12 , if for every @xmath22 and any @xmath23 where @xmath24 , there is a @xmath25 with @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "the control @xmath11 is chosen with the knowledge of @xmath28 , and applied to place the trajectory again in the set @xmath21 .",
    "we say that trajectories found under these conditions are * admissible trajectories*. sometimes , the set @xmath21 can consist of many components , while others is a connected set like the right side of fig .",

    "to apply the control , the controller only needs to measure the state of the disturbed system , that is @xmath7 $ ] .",

    ", where each @xmath32 has @xmath33 for some control @xmath34 , which is chosen depending on @xmath5 .",
    "notice that the removed region does not satisfy @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=62.0% ] +    one of the advantages of this method is that the set @xmath21 can be determined computationally following an iterative process .",
    "the set @xmath15 is represented by a grid stored in a computer . beginning with the region @xmath35 , in the first iteration we remove the grid points @xmath36",
    "for which there are @xmath23 with @xmath24 such that @xmath37 can not be moved back inside @xmath18 using a @xmath25 for which @xmath26 . as a result of this first pruning",
    ", a new region @xmath38 is obtained . applying the same process to @xmath39",
    ", we obtain a smaller set @xmath40 . repeating this process until it converges ,",
    "the final set denoted @xmath21 is found .",
    "this set is known as the * safe set*. based on this idea , we create an algorithm that we called the * sculpting algorithm * @xcite , for computing the successive regions @xmath41 until the safe set is finally found .",
    "we illustrate the procedure of finding the safe set in fig .  [ 2 ] . we are given the bound @xmath12 and @xmath6 and the region @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath42 step can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "fatten the set @xmath43 by @xmath12 , obtaining the set denoted @xmath44 .",
    "2 .   shrink the set @xmath44 by @xmath6 , obtaining the set denoted @xmath45 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath46 be the points @xmath47 of @xmath43 , for which @xmath48 is inside the set denoted @xmath45 .",
    "4 .   return to step @xmath49 , unless @xmath50 , in which case we set @xmath51 .",
    "we call this final region , the",
    "_ safe set_. note that if the chosen @xmath12 is too small , then @xmath21 may be the empty set and a bigger value of @xmath12 must be selected .",
    "is fattened by the thickness @xmath12 .",
    "the fattened set is displayed in red .",
    "then , the new set is shrunk or contracted by a distance @xmath6 , obtaining the set denoted @xmath45 ( in green ) .",
    "finally we remove the grid points @xmath52 whose image @xmath48 falls outside @xmath45 .",
    "notice that @xmath53.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=73.0% ] +    to implement the algorithm , we need to choose a grid of points in which we represent the set @xmath43 . as we remove points from the grid representation of @xmath43 , the process eventually stops when @xmath50 for some @xmath54 , and we write @xmath51 for that @xmath54 . due to the complex shape of the chaotic saddle underlying the chaotic dynamics",
    ", the derivation of a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm would be extremely difficult .",
    "however we can show in a very intuitive way that the algorithm converges in a finite number of steps to a safe set . to find the safe set , we begin with a grid of points covering @xmath15 which contains a finite number of points .",
    "then , the sculpting algorithm removes in each iteration the points that do not satisfy the control condition . as a result",
    ", subsets @xmath55 are obtained .",
    "we iterate this process until @xmath56 , being @xmath41 the safe set .",
    "therefore the finite number of initial points of @xmath15 ensures that the iterative process converges to a safe set , if it exists , in a finite number of steps .",
    "finally it is important to mention the influence of the grid resolution .",
    "the finite resolution of the grid implies a certain imprecision in obtaining the safe set .",
    "if we call @xmath57 the grid resolution spacing in each dimension , the total error ( the maximum distance to the nearest grid point ) will be @xmath58 .",
    "for example , if we have a 2d grid with resolution @xmath59 , the error in the representation of a point @xmath20 will be @xmath60 . for a good precision in the computation , we recommend here to take a grid resolution @xmath61 times smaller than the magnitude of the control @xmath12 . with this resolution the shape of the safe set usually remains practically unchanged with respect to the safe sets obtained with higher resolution .",
    "this practical recommendation gives a relative error in the control of @xmath62 , that is , when we are applying control we will have to put only a @xmath62 more of control in the worst cases .",
    "the increase of the resolution grid improves the precision , but the computational time has a polynomial growth with the dimension of the map , so there is a trade - off between the precision and the computational cost .",
    "to describe how the method can be applied to a flow affected by disturbances , we have chosen the lorenz system @xcite , which is one of the best known models in nonlinear dynamics .",
    "this system is a flow , that describes a simplified model of atmospheric convection .",
    "the model consists of three ordinary differential equations , @xmath63 depending on the parameter values @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , the system can exhibit different dynamical behaviors , either periodic solutions , chaotic attractors or even transient chaos .",
    "fixing @xmath67 , @xmath68 , transient chaos can be found in the interval @xmath69 $ ] as described in @xcite . for our simulations , we have chosen the value @xmath70 . in this regime , as we show in the left side of fig .  [ 3 ] , there are transient chaotic orbits that eventually decay towards one of the two point attractors .",
    "@xmath71 which physically represent a steady rotation of a fluid flow , one clockwise , and the other counterclockwise . without intervention , transient chaotic trajectories will escape towards these point attractors .    , @xmath68 and @xmath72 . on the left ,",
    "the trajectory is deterministic . on the right",
    ", the trajectory is affected by some disturbances .",
    "the disturbances here , were enlarged in order to help the eye .",
    "almost all trajectories eventually spiral to one of the two attractors ( @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) . here",
    "both trajectories spiral to @xmath73.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    to make this system more realistic , we have added disturbances .",
    "the source of the disturbances in a chaotic flow may be diverse , as for example continuous or discrete noise affecting the dynamics , mismatches of the model equations from reality , or the finite precision in the measurement of the state of the system .",
    "this last possibility is especially relevant in chaotic systems since uncertainty grows exponentially with time . in the right side of fig .  [",
    "3 ] , we show an example of the lorenz flow affected by some disturbances , where the trajectory eventually spirals to the @xmath73 attractor .",
    "our goal here is to apply the partial control method to avoid having trajectories falling to the attractors @xmath73 or @xmath74 and sustaining them in the transient chaotic regime .    since the lorenz system is a flow , different maps",
    "can be built , depending on our goals .",
    "one important consideration about the application of the method , is how we want to apply the control .",
    "one way is to perturb only certain variables of the system .",
    "another possibility is to apply the control only in certain regions of phase space .",
    "alternatively , we can also apply the control at regular times , independently of the state of the system . in all cases , it is important to analyze how the disturbances arise in the map constructed from the flow .",
    "the upper bound of the disturbances in the discrete map could be easily estimated in an experimental setup , measuring the maximum dispersion of an ensemble of trajectories with the same initial condition for a particular poincar section ( 2d case ) or stroboscopic section ( in the 3d case ) .",
    "this procedure could be repeated for several initial conditions taking as upper bound of the disturbances the maximum value of the dispersion found for all the initial conditions tested .",
    "this upper bound is the only requirement needed to apply the sculpting algorithm to compute the safe set .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ 4 ] , we follow lorenz and discretize the flow by taking the consecutive maxima of the variable @xmath75 , then we obtain a one - dimensional map .",
    "we write @xmath76 for the successive maximum @xmath75 value . in red",
    ", we represent different trajectories affected by different disturbances starting from @xmath76 . as a consequence ,",
    "the trajectories spread out to yield a dispersion width in @xmath77 .",
    "we can estimate the upper bound of the disturbance @xmath6 in the map , as half of the dispersion width .",
    "the dynamics in the map will be @xmath78 with @xmath29 . for systems of higher dimensions",
    "the disturbance in the map can be estimated in the same way . to do that",
    ", we have to take every point of the grid and analyze how is the dispersion of the possible trajectories when they return to the map .",
    "after that , we take @xmath6 as the maximum dispersion observed , recalling that we are assuming bounded disturbances in the dynamics .    * .",
    "a map constructed taking successive maxima of @xmath75 , with the notation @xmath76 . in red ,",
    "several trajectories are affected by some small disturbances along the trajectory , all of them starting in the same initial condition .",
    "the different trajectories spread out until they reach the next maximum @xmath77 . considering the dispersion width in the values of @xmath77 as @xmath79 , the bound of the effective disturbance affecting the map is @xmath80.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=67.0% ] +    due to the several possibilities for implementing the method in a flow , we describe in the next section three different ways by using a 1d , 2d and 3d map , and discussing the main pros and cons of each choice .",
    "we assume in all of them that the upper bound of the disturbances in the map have been previously measured , by using the method described above .",
    "as shown by lorenz @xcite , a 1d map for the lorenz system , can be created by taking the consecutive maxima of the variable @xmath75 .",
    "when plotting the pairs @xmath81 , one gets ( approximately ) a function @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "see fig .",
    "this is only possible because the sets are very thin . knowing a local maximum of @xmath75 is @xmath84 , allows one to estimate @xmath85 and @xmath86 with considerable precision .    for this map",
    ", transient chaos can be observed in the interval @xmath87 $ ] , so we have chosen this interval as the set @xmath18 .",
    "we have taken @xmath88 .",
    "if the control bound @xmath12 is chosen too small , there will be no safe set , and it will be impossible to prevent escapes . in this case , we have taken as the control bound @xmath89 ( @xmath14 ) which is approximately the minimum value for which a safe set exists .",
    "then , we have obtained the safe set by using the recursive sculpting algorithm . in fig .  [ 5 ] , we can see how the algorithm sculpts the initial region @xmath18 until it finds @xmath90 where it converges , so @xmath91 is the safe set .",
    "for this computation we have used a grid of @xmath92 points in the interval @xmath93 $ ] , so the grid resolution is @xmath94 .    .",
    "we take as initial set @xmath18 ( upper segment in blue ) the region where transient chaos occurs .",
    "the map is affected by disturbances with an upper bound @xmath88 , while we choose the upper bound of the control as @xmath89 , ( the bounds are the width of the bars displayed in the upper left side ) .",
    "the figure shows the successive steps computed by the sculpting algorithm , from an initial region @xmath18 until it converges to the subset @xmath95 .",

    "the figure shows a comparison between an uncontrolled trajectory that escapes from chaos ( red line ) and a partially controlled trajectory ( black line ) .",
    "starting with the same initial condition , the uncontrolled trajectory eventually decays to @xmath73 or @xmath74 , which physically means a steady rotation of the fluid flow . on the other hand the partially controlled trajectory",
    "is maintained in the chaotic transient regime , that is , the rotation of the fluid flow remains chaotic forever.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=85.0% ] +    the safe set computed ensures for any starting point @xmath20 in the safe set and any allowable @xmath5 , there is a @xmath11 that puts @xmath96 back in the safe set .",
    "this is true for the map , however , the control is applied in the phase space so we must take into account of the fact that as each local maximum of @xmath75 is described by @xmath2 coordinates @xmath97 , the total distance to the safe set is is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the closest point belonging to the safe set . in fig .",
    "[ 6 ] we show a controlled time series of the @xmath75 variable in contrast with an uncontrolled trajectory .",
    "we can see that chaos is sustained by applying small perturbations in the maxima of the variable @xmath75 .",
    "the main advantage of this 1d approach is that the computation of the safe set is easy and fast .",
    "this kind of map is useful when the disturbed trajectories mainly spread out along the expanding direction of the chaotic saddle , as occurs in the case of stochastic noise or uncertainties in the application of the controls .",
    "see for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an ecological model of three species was studied . in that case , it was possible to construct a map of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath75 kept constant , and only @xmath102 changed after one iteration of the map .",
    "that kind of situations allows the control of system while perturbing only one of the variables .      in the case of three - dimensional flows",

    "in addition , as opposed to the 1d map , where we have to act on the @xmath102 , @xmath101 and @xmath75 variables to control the system , the control in the 2d map is only applied in the variables @xmath102 and @xmath101 , since @xmath75 is constant . this can be an advantage in systems where it is difficult or expensive to apply the control in each variable .",
    "the 1d approach as well as the 2d approach , have the disadvantage of having to track the trajectory to know when it passes through the control region , where we apply the control corrections .",
    "another strategy is to put the focus on the time instead of the variables . in this way , it is possible to apply the partial control method using a time discretization of the lorenz system , which allows us to obtain a 3d discrete map . with this kind of map it is possible to avoid the escapes from chaos by applying the control with a fixed time interval , which can be a useful practice in many situations .",
    "the 3d map is obtained from the 3d flow by taking a suitable time interval @xmath9 between the current state of the system and the future state , that is , @xmath115 . by computing the time-@xmath9 image of each point of a 3d grid that cover the phase space , we can obtain the 3d map .",
    "the choice of @xmath9 is important , since it is related with the topology of the map obtained .",
    "if @xmath9 is too small no safe sets exist ( given @xmath116 ) , while for a sufficiently large time interval , the safe set appears .",
    "the topological explanation for this , is that the flow is acting like a pastry transformation which takes some time to be completed .",

    "this strategy can provide a possibly useful way to control real situations .",
    "for example , in the context of medicine , a medical treatment based on the partial control method , could be applied a fixed day of the week , which supposes an easy and convenient control relationship between the physician and the patient . to highlight this feature , we compare in fig .  [ 18 ] , three controlled trajectories obtained with the respective map ( 3d , 2d and 1d ) .",
    "we have marked in the figure , the points where the control is applied . notice that , unlike the other maps , in the 3d map it is possible to apply the control with a fixed time interval .",
    "for the application of the partial control method a very few amount of ingredients are required .",
    "we only need a transient chaotic system with escapes , the knowledge of the upper bound of the disturbances and an upper bound control high enough to find a safe set with the sculpting algorithm .",
    "we believe that these conditions are rather general . in the real time application of the control ,",
    "the controller only needs to know which is the state of the system and which is the safe set .",
    "if the state of the system is in the safe set no control is applied , whereas if the state of the system is not in the safe set , a small amount of control is needed to put the system inside the safe set again .",
    "we have applied the partial control method to the lorenz system in the presence of disturbances , for a particular choice of parameters where it shows transient chaos .",
    "typical uncontrolled trajectories in this system follow a chaotic motion until they escape to one of its two stable non - chaotic attractors . with the goal of avoiding these escapes , we have applied the partial control method in three different ways .",
    "we have built 1d , 2d and 3d maps , and obtained the respective safe sets with the sculpting algorithm .    using the respective safe sets in each case",
    ", we have shown that is possible to control the trajectories , using a small amount of control in comparison with the disturbances affecting the system .",
    "another remarkable feature is that the partially controlled trajectories keep the chaotic behavior of the original system . since @xmath136 , it is impossible for the controller to completely determine the oscillatory behavior .",
    "the possibility of using different kinds of maps to control the dynamics allows us flexibility .",
    "however , in some situations it can be convenient to apply the control in periodic time intervals .",
    "this strategy is shown in the 3d case with a fixed time discretization @xmath9 .",
    "this novel approach , allows us to focus the attention only in the time instead of the control region .",
    "in addition , the frequency of these controls can be adapted depending on the specific experimental requirements , which can suppose an easy and flexible way to control the system .",
    "finally , we want to highlight the potential of this control approach .",
    "the lorenz system was considered here , because is a very well known and paradigmatic system in nonlinear dynamics and it shows in a clear way how the partial control method works .",
