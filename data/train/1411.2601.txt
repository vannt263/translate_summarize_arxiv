    "in general relativity ( gr ) , any spacetime can be regarded as a solution to the einstein field equations @xmath0 , if one defines the energy momentum tensor of the matter according to the left hand side of the equation , that can be calculated from the metric tensor of the spacetime .",
    "however the matter tensor so defined will in general have unphysical properties and in most of the cases will have no resemblance to the standard matter around us . hence by the term _ exact solution _ of einstein field equations we shall mean the following : a spacetime ( @xmath1 ) in which the field equations are satisfied with the energy momentum tensor ( @xmath2 ) of some specific form of matter which obeys the postulate of local causality and at least one of the physically reasonable energy conditions @xcite .",
    "most of the well known exact solutions are thus for the empty space ( @xmath3 ) , for an electromagnetic field , for a perfect fluid or for combination of these . because of the extreme complexity of the field equations , which are in general 10 coupled non linear second order partial differential equations , it is impossible to find exact solutions except in the spaces of high symmetry ( e.g. spherical symmetry ) and for relatively simple matter content . in this regard",
    "these exact solutions are rather idealised .",
    "nevertheless , the exact solutions give the idea of important qualitative features that can arise in gr and hence the possible properties of the realistic solutions of field equations .",
    "one of the most intriguing and challenging task is to find the global properties of the field equations by the maximal analytic extension of the local solutions .",
    "study of these global structure of the solutions are important as we get the maximal manifold ( @xmath1 ) on which the solution is valid and hence the maximal complete atlas .",
    "this enables us to get rid of all the coordinate singularities that may appear due to bad choice of coordinates while solving the field equations .",
    "obtaining such maximal extension may be tedious and tricky as one needs to cleverly redefine the spacetime coordinates so that the space around the coordinate singularity becomes regular . by this step ,",
    "we get rid of the coordinate singularity and the metric tensor becomes nondegenerate even in the locus of the previous coordinate singularity .",
    "we may continue it as far as we can till this process ultimately stops because the spacetime is surrounded either by asymptotic infinity - infinite volume where trajectories may be extended to an infinite proper length - or by genuine ( curvature ) singularities that can not be extended by any coordinates .",
    "geodesics physically terminate at those real singularities .",
    "we know dynamical systems approach has proven to be a very important mathematical tool in studying the global properties of various cosmologies in gr @xcite and also other higher order theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "similar analysis were performed to study the properties of spherically symmetric solutions in dimensionally reduced spacetimes and diatonic black holes in gr and other higher order theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the most important advantage of dynamical systems technique is that without solving the system completely one can have qualitative informations on important global features of the phase space , in terms of the fixed points of the system , their stabilities and different invariant submanifolds of the complete phase space .",
    "the aim of this paper is as follows :    a.   using a semitetrad covariant formalism , we show that one can recast the field equations ( which are the combination of ricci and doubly contracted bianchi identities ) for vacuum ( with or without a cosmological constant ) or electrovacua locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs - ii ) spacetimes into an autonomous system of covariantly defined variables . hence by definition , this autonomous system is gauge independent .",
    "b.   using the usual poincar compactification , we compactify the phase space of this autonomous system . c.   using the general symmetries of lrs - ii spacetimes and the properties of the phase space of the above defined autonomous system , we show that we can have the qualitative idea of all the important global features of these spacetimes , without actually solving the system .",
    "thus the analysis developed in this paper can be effectively used to find the important global properties of other more realistic solutions of einstein field equations , without solving these equations .    in this paper , we confine our attention to spherically symmetric vacuum ( with or without a cosmological constant ) or electrovacuum , see @xcite for applications to modified gravity theories . for technical reasons",
    "it is convenient to consider a class of spacetimes which are a small generalisation of spherically symmetric metrics : namely _ locally rotationally symmetric _ ( lrs ) class ii spacetimes @xcite .",
    "these are evolving and vorticity free spacetimes with a 1-dimensional isotropy group of spatial rotations at every point .",
    "except for few higher symmetry cases , these spacetimes have locally ( at each point ) a unique preferred spatial direction that is covariantly defined .",
    "to describe these spacetimes in terms of metric components , it is well known that the most general interval for lrs - ii is written as @xcite @xmath4 \\;,\\label{lrsds}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are parameters along the integral curves of the timelike vector field @xmath7 and the preferred spacelike vector field @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath9 for @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the 2-metric @xmath11 describes spherical , flat , or open homogeneous and isotropic 2-surfaces for @xmath10 .",
    "spherically symmetric spacetimes are the @xmath12 subclass of these spacetimes .",
    "one can easily see that all the physically interesting spherically symmetric spacetimes fall in the class lrs - ii .",
    "it has been recently shown in @xcite , that a vacuum or electrovac lrs - ii spacetime ( with or without a cosmological constant ) has an extra symmetry in terms of existence of a killing vector in local @xmath13 $ ] plane , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are timelike and spacelike vector fields respectively , defined above .",
    "this extra killing vector , if timelike , makes the spacetime locally static and if spacelike makes the spacetime localy spatially homogeneous . in the maximally extended manifold these two sections",
    "are joined via a 3 dimensional submanifold commonly know as the event horizon . using this extra symmetry of lrs - ii spacetimes , we recast the field equations into a covariantly defined autonomous system separately for both these sections , compactify the phase spaces and show that we can recover all the important features of the global properties of these solutions .",
    "the formalism follows the same strategy as the @xmath16 decomposition or threading of space - time ( see @xcite for a comparison with the so - called @xmath17 formalism , or slicing of space - time ) , where one split the spacetime onto a timelike and an orthogonal three - dimensional spacelike hypersurface . all information is captured in a set of kinematic and dynamic variables .",
    "we can further decompose the 3-hypersurface into a spacelike vector and a 2-space .",
    "this strategy was developed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the so - called @xmath18 formalism ) . in this paper",
    "we will study the simple problem of spherically symmetric spacetimes , hence the full set of variables are scalars @xcite which simplifies the analysis .",
    "in fact , the same situation happens in cosmology where the space is homogeneous and isotropic and by virtue of the symmetry the @xmath16 decomposition gives rise to equations evolving only scalars .",
    "therefore the only non - zero variables for any rotationally symmetric spacetime are scalars in the @xmath19 approach , therefore it is natural approach for study of lrs spacetimes .",
    "first we perform a standard @xmath16 decomposition . for this",
    ", we define a unit timelike vector @xmath14 @xmath20 which defines the projection tensor on the 3-space @xmath21 . hence we can define two derivatives ; one following the vector @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 and a projected derivative defined as @xmath24 further we perform the split of the 3-space by introducing a unit spacelike vector @xmath25 @xmath26 with a projection tensor on the 2-space ( sheet ) orthogonal to @xmath27 and @xmath14 @xmath28 hence we can define two additional derivatives along @xmath27 in the surface orthogonal to @xmath14 @xmath29 and a projected derivative onto the sheet @xmath30      the riemann curvature tensor represents completely the spacetime which is fully determined by the weyl tensor ( free gravitational field ) and the ricci tensor which is determined locally at each point by the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "hence in a fully @xmath16 covariant approach , we split the weyl curvature tensor @xmath31 relative to @xmath14 into electric @xmath32 and magnetic @xmath33 parts and @xmath34 is the 3-space permutation symbol .",
    "also the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 can be decomposed relative to @xmath14 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the energy density , @xmath37 isotropic pressure , @xmath38 momentum density ( energy flux ) and @xmath39 trace - free anisotropic pressure ( anisotropic stress ) . for lrs spacetime ,",
    "only scalars do not vanish after the additional decomposition of space .",
    "hence the only non - zero part of the heat flux and the anisotropic pressure are @xmath40 also the non - zero part of the electric part of weyl tensor is @xmath41 and we will focus on spherically symmetric spacetimes with @xmath27 points along the radial direction . hence the spacetime is vorticity free ( lrs - ii ) which further constrains the magnetic weyl curvature @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the additional non - zero geometrical quantities are respectively the expansion ( @xmath43 ) , shear ( @xmath44 ) , sheet expansion ( @xmath45 ) and acceleration ( @xmath46 )      the complete set of propagation and/or evolution equations which define these spacetimes , namely lrs class ii spacetimes , are :      @xmath47      @xmath48      @xmath49    in most general case we will consider only electromagnetic field . assuming that we do not have magnetic monopole or using the duality rotation @xcite , we can always suppress the magnetic field in the vacuum .",
    "also the electric field can be decomposed in the form @xmath50 which is solution of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we have @xmath53}$ ] from which we have @xmath54\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we can always absorb the constants and work with the variable @xmath36 which is solution of the equations @xmath59    we also define the gaussian curvature via the ricci tensor on the sheet @xmath60 which can be written in the form @xcite @xmath61 it gives from the previous equations @xmath62    notice that eq.([gausscurv ] ) is a constraint because for any surface @xmath63 is fixed , e.g. in schwarzschild coordinates we have @xmath64 .",
    "this equation will be used to define the dimensionless variables as the friedmann equation is used in cosmology .      in this part",
    "we will consider spacetime with an additional timelike killing vector .",
    "therefore all the time derivatives are zero , hence it can easily seen from the previous equations that @xmath65 . as a consequence the variables @xmath66 fully characterize the kinematics .",
    "we define the dimensionless geometrical variables in the following way @xmath67    we have from ( [ equation31])-([evogauss ] ) :    @xmath68    where we have defined the dimensionless spatial derivative @xmath69 .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we discussed the static case . here",
    "we will assume the presence of spacelike killing vector .",
    "hence all space - derivatives will be zero .",
    "therefore for the non - static universe , @xmath70 and the variables @xmath71 completely characterize the system . along with the definitions in ( [ variable1 ] ) ,",
    "we further define two new variables @xmath72 here the propagation of the variables will be zero and only the evolution terms remain .",
    "the system of equations from ( [ equation31])-([evogauss ] ) , turns out to be :    @xmath73    where we define the dimensionless temporal derivative @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we will assume vacuum i.e. @xmath75 .      only the variables @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are non - zero .",
    "we use the last constraint ( [ sc2 ] ) to reduce the system to    @xmath79    the analysis of the system is carried out in the standard way . notice that the full knowledge of the dynamical system should comprise its behaviour at infinity . hence we transform the phase space into the so - called poincar sphere , a sphere with unit radius , tangent to the plane @xmath80 at the origin . every point of the plane @xmath80",
    "is mapped into 2 points on the surface of the sphere which are situated on the line passing through the point @xmath80 and the center of the sphere .",
    "therefore , infinitely distant points of the plane are mapped into the equator of the sphere .",
    "finally we will represent the orthogonal projection of any one of the hemispheres ( to do away with duplicate points ) of the sphere onto the tangent plane .",
    "this is the projective plane . in the compactified phase portrait",
    ", we will use capital letters @xmath81 . under poincar transformation ,",
    "the equations become @xmath82 where we have defined @xmath83 with the constraint @xmath84 and rescaled the derivative @xmath85 .",
    "the analysis of the dynamical system for vacuum is summarized in table [ tab : rg ] and the phase portrait is shown in fig.[fig : rg ] .",
    "notice that for each point we gave the stability .",
    "a hyperbolic equilibrium can be an attractor , repeller or saddle point .",
    "but there are many more types for non - hyperbolic equilibria",
    ". most of these equilibria do not have names .",
    "a complete classification does nt exist .",
    "therefore for non - hyperbolic critical points we will specify only if it is stable or unstable .",

    "there are various ways to do it",
    ". it can be derived by solving the linearised equations around the critical points .",
    "first , we need to define a coordinate system .",
    "we will use the spherical coordinates with a metric in the following form @xmath105 in order to understand the nature of critical point , we need to determine the different variables in terms of the metric . from the definition ( [ metric ] ) , we define the four - velocity @xmath106 and the radial vector @xmath107 . hence we get @xmath108 also we can rewrite the derivatives in the following form @xmath109 where @xmath64 and we have used @xmath110 .",
    "the last equality comes from ( [ def : phi ] ) .",
    "hence we have @xmath111 from which we can easily recover the metric at each critical point .",
    "notice that each critical point is at a fixed value of radial distance @xmath112 , hence it is necessary to perform a linearisation around the point in order to do an integration and recover the gravitational potential @xmath113 .",
    "for example , the solution of the dynamical system reduces around the critical point @xmath114 to @xmath115 from ( [ metricx ] ) we get @xmath116 the point @xmath117 corresponds to the limit where @xmath118 , therefore @xmath117 is the minkowski spacetime .",
    "notice from ( [ def : phi ] ) that @xmath119 , hence we have @xmath120 .",
    "but if we take the inner normal to the surface @xmath121 we will have @xmath122 .",
    "hence the phase space @xmath123 will be opposite to the subspace @xmath120 , the nature of the points will be reversed , e.g. an attractor will be repeller ( because of sign change in derivative ( [ deriv ] ) ) . also we see from ( [ def : a],[def : phi ] ) that reversing the direction of @xmath124 has no effect , because of the static nature of the spacetime .",
    "we also notice that in the kruskal - szekeres coordinates , we have @xmath125 when @xmath126 .",
    "therefore the normal vector to this hypersurface is @xmath127 or @xmath128 . in these coordinates , inner / outer direction of",
    "the spacelike normal vector @xmath129 corresponds to the transformation @xmath130 which is equivalent to the transformation from exterior region to parallel exterior region .",
    "therefore the phase space corresponding to @xmath123 is the parallel exterior region .",
    "the analysis covers the static part of the black hole and the white hole .",
    "we can do the same for the points at infinity , e.g. the point @xmath131 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath132 .",
    "the solution of the dynamical system around this point ( the dynamical system is given in the table [ tab : rg ] ) is @xmath133 which gives @xmath134 after redefinition of time ( constant is absorbed for @xmath113 ) , we have @xmath135 therefore in the limit @xmath118 , we conclude that @xmath131 corresponds to the singularity at @xmath136 .",
    "finally @xmath137 is a little bit more subtle .",
    "in fact we ca nt linearise the equations around this point .",
    "we notice that in a stationary spacetime , the apparent horizon coincides with the event horizon and the apparent horizon is a marginally trapped surface on which the outgoing null geodesics have zero expansion @xcite .",
    "we define 2 spacelike vectors @xmath138 on the 2-surface , which define an orthonormal basis with @xmath139 the normal spacelike vector to the 2-surface and @xmath124 the timelike vector",
    ". hence we can write the metric as @xmath140 also the expansion of the outgoing null geodesics is @xcite @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the outgoing null vector . hence ( [ eq : theta ] ) can be written as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the extrinsic curvature .",
    "using the decomposition of the extrinsic curvature and the definition of sheet expansion , we have @xmath145 therefore we conclude that @xmath146 @xcite for the apparent horizon ( @xmath147 ) and hence @xmath148 for static case , which implies @xmath137 is horizon .",
    "hence we see from fig.([fig : rg ] ) that if the system starts from the horizon @xmath149 it goes asymptotically to the minkowski spacetime @xmath150 which corresponds to the standard schwarzschild black hole solution with a positive mass and if the system starts from the singularity @xmath151 it evolves also till minkowski spacetime but without crossing horizon .",
    "that solution corresponds to a naked singularity where the mass is negative .",
    "the transformation to the extended spacetime @xmath130 is equivalent to @xmath152 which gives the other part of the phase space where @xmath153 which means anti - gravity or defocusing of geodesics .      for this case , only the variables @xmath76 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are non - zero .",
    "we also use the constraint ( [ nsc2 ] ) to reduce the system to @xmath156 there are no finite fixed points . under poincar transformation ,",
    "the equations become @xmath157 where we have rescaled the derivative @xmath158    we perform the same analysis as before except that the metric takes the following form @xmath159 we define the normal vectors as @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "it is easy to see that for any field @xmath162 , we have @xmath163 .",
    "we can also get @xmath164 and @xmath165 which gives @xmath166 . hence @xmath167 .",
    "the position of the horizon corresponds to @xmath168 .",
    "also the line of constant time are in the kruskal coordinates defined by @xmath169 so in these coordinates we have @xmath170 or @xmath171 . the transformation from non static black hole to non static white hole is ( @xmath172 , @xmath173 ) or equivalently by reversing the sign of @xmath174 . as previously the metric can be written in terms of the normalized variables @xmath175 and the derivative @xmath176    hence it is easy to analyse the system and find the nature of each critical points . the final result is summarized in the table [ tab : irg ] and the phase portrait is shown on fig.[fig : rgi ] .",
