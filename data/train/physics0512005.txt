    "gibrat  @xcite , building upon the work of the astronomers kapteyn  @xcite , assumed the expected value of the growth rate of a business firm s size to be proportional to the current size of the firm , which is called `` law of proportionate effect ''  @xcite .",
    "several models of proportional growth have been subsequently introduced in economics in order to explain the growth of business firms  @xcite .",
    "simon and co - authors  @xcite extended gibrat s model by introducing an entry process according to which the number of firms rise over time . in simon s framework , the market consists of a sequence of many independent `` opportunities '' which arise over time , each of size unity .",
    "models in this tradition have been challenged by many researchers  @xcite who found that the firm growth distribution is not gaussian but displays a tent shape .",
    "here we introduce a general framework that provides an unifying explanation for the growth of business firms based on the number and size distribution of their elementary constituent components  @xcite .",
    "specifically we present a model of proportional growth in both the number of units and their size and we draw some general implications on the mechanisms which sustain business firm growth  @xcite . according to the model , the probability density function ( pdf ) of growth rates is laplace in the center  @xcite with power law tails  @xcite decaying as @xmath2 where @xmath1 .    because of data limitations , previous studies in this field focus on the laplace shape of the body of the distribution  @xcite . using a database on the size and growth of firms and products , we characterize the shape of the whole growth rate distribution .",
    "we test our model by analyzing different levels of aggregation of economic systems , from the `` micro '' level of products to the `` macro '' level of industrial sectors and national economies .",
    "we find that the model accurately predicts the shape of the pdf of growth rate at all levels of aggregation studied .",
    "we model business firms as classes consisting of a random number of units . according to this view ,",
    "a firm is represented as the aggregation of its constituent units such as divisions  @xcite , businesses  @xcite , or products  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , on a different level of coarse - graining , a class can represent a national economy composed by economic units such as firms . in this article",
    "we study the logarithm of the one - year growth rate of classes @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the sizes of classes in the year @xmath6 and @xmath7 measured in monetary values ( gdp for countries , sales for firms and products ) . our model",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "two key sets of assumptions in the model are ( a ) the number of units in a class grows in proportion to the existing number of units and ( b ) the size of each unit fluctuates in proportion to its size .",
    "the first set of assumptions is :    * each class @xmath8 consists of @xmath9 number of units . at time @xmath10 , time step measured by year generally , there are @xmath11 classes consisting of @xmath12 total number of units .",
    "the initial average number of units in a class is thus @xmath13 .",
    "* at each time step a new unit is created .",
    "thus the number of units at time @xmath6 is @xmath14 . * with birth probability @xmath15 ,",
    "this new unit is assigned to a new class , so that the average number of classes at time @xmath6 is @xmath16 . * with probability @xmath17",
    ", a new unit is assigned to an existing class @xmath8 with probability @xmath18 , so @xmath19 .    for simplicity",
    ", we do not consider the decrease of the number of units in a class .",
    "in reality , elementary units enter and exit . because we are considering the case of a growing economy ,",
    "it is legitimate to assume the entry rate being higher than the exit rate . on the average",
    ", the net entry rate of units can be simplified as a positive constant . in the model , the net entry rate of units",
    "is fixed at @xmath20 .",
    "thus , at large @xmath6 , it gives results equivalent to the ones that would have been obtained considering a value for the exit rate of units .",
    "our goal is to find @xmath21 , the probability distribution of the number of units in the classes at large @xmath6 .",
    "this model in two limiting cases ( i ) @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 and ( ii ) @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 has exact analytical solutions @xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite respectively .    in the general case ,",
    "the exact analytical solution is not known and we obtain a numerical solution by computer simulations and compare it with the approximate mean field solution .",
    "( see , e.g. , chapter 6 of  @xcite and appendix a ) our results are consistent with the exactly solvable limiting cases as well as with the empirical data on the number of products in the pharmaceutical firms and can summarized as follows . in the limit of large @xmath6",

    "the distribution of units in the new classes created at @xmath35 converges to a power law with an exponential cutoff @xmath36 where @xmath37 for small @xmath15 , and @xmath38 decays for @xmath39 faster than @xmath40 .",

    "the second set of assumptions is :    * at time @xmath6 , each class @xmath8 has @xmath9 units of size @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are independent random variables taken from the distributions @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "@xmath49 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ p_k_final ] ) and @xmath50 is a given distribution with finite mean and standard deviation and @xmath51 has finite mean @xmath52 and variance @xmath53 .",
    "the size of a class is defined as @xmath54 . * at time @xmath7 , the size of each unit is decreased or increased by a random factor @xmath55 so that @xmath56 where @xmath57 , the growth rate of unit @xmath58 , is independent random variable taken from a distribution @xmath59 , which has a finite mean .",
    "we also assume that @xmath60 has finite mean @xmath61 and variance @xmath62 .",
    "the growth rate of each class is defined as @xmath63    here we neglect the influx of the new units , so @xmath64 .",
    "the resulting distribution of the growth rates of all classes is determined by @xmath65 where @xmath21 is the distribution of the number of units in the classes , computed in the previous stage of the model and @xmath66 is the conditional distribution of growth rates of classes with given number of units determined by the distribution @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the analytical solution of this model can be obtained only for certain limiting cases but a numerical solution can be easily computed for any set of assumptions .",
    "we investigate the model numerically and analytically ( see appendix b ) and find :    * the conditional distribution of the logarithmic growth rates @xmath66 for the firms consisting of a fixed number of units converges to a gaussian distribution for @xmath39 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a function of parameters of the distribution @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and @xmath71 is mean logarithmic growth rate of a unit , @xmath72 . +",

    "the distribution @xmath0 coincides with the distribution of the logarithms of the growth rates of the units : @xmath75 in the case of power law distribution @xmath76 which dramatically increases for @xmath77 , the distribution @xmath0 is dominated by the growth rates of classes consisting of a single unit @xmath78 , thus the distribution @xmath0 practically coincides with @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",

    "to test our model , we analyze different levels of aggregation of economic systems , from the micro level of products to the macro level of industrial sectors and national economies .",
    "first , we analyze a new and unique database , the pharmaceutical industry database ( phid ) , which records sales figures of the 189,303 products commercialized by 7,184 pharmaceutical firms in 21 countries from 1994 to 2004 , covering the whole size distribution for products and firms and monitoring the flows of entry and exit at both levels kindly provided by the epris program .",
    "then , we study the growth rates of all u.s .",
    "publicly - traded firms from 1973 to 2004 in all industries , based on security exchange commission filings ( compustat ) . finally ,",
    "at the macro level , we study the growth rates of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) of 195 countries from 1960 to 2004 ( world bank ) .    fig .",
    "[ growth_dist ] shows that the growth distributions of countries , firms , and products are well fitted by the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ p_new_1 ] ) with different values of @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , growth distributions at any level of aggregation depict marked departures from a gaussian shape .",
    "moreover , even if the @xmath0 of gdp can be approximated by a laplace distribution , the @xmath0 of firms and products are clearly more leptokurtic than laplace . based on our model ,",
    "the growth distribution is laplace in the body , with power - law tails .",
    "in fact , fig .  [ body ] show that the central body part of the growth rate distributions at any level of aggregation is well approximated by a double exponential fit .",
    "[ tails ] reveals that the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath80 at any level of aggregation can be well fitted by power - law with an exponent @xmath1 .    our analysis in sec .",
    "ii predicts that the power law regime of @xmath0 may vary depending on the behavior of @xmath21 for @xmath77 , and the distribution of the growth rates of units . in case of phid ,",
    "for which @xmath107 the growth rate distribution of firms must be almost the same as the growth rate distribution of products , as we stated in sec .",
    "hence the power law wings of @xmath0 for firms originate on the level of products .",
    "because phid does not contain information on the subunits of products we can not test our prediction directly , but we can hypothesize that the distribution of the product subunits ( number of customers or shipping ways ) is less dominated by small @xmath30 , but has a sufficiently wide power law regime due to the influx of new products .",
    "these rather plausible assumptions are sufficient to explain the shape of the distribution of the product growth rates , which is well described by eq .",
    "( [ p_new_1 ] ) .",
    "the phid database allows us to test the empirical conditional distribution @xmath108 and the dependence of its variance @xmath109 on @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the number of products .",
    "we find that @xmath110 , which is significantly smaller than @xmath111 behavior",
    ". this result does not imply correlations among product growth rates on the firm level  @xcite , but can be explained by the fact that for skewed distributions of product sizes @xmath67 characterized by large @xmath112 , the convergence of @xmath66 to its gaussian limit eq .",
    "( [ p_g_gk ] ) is slow and the growth rates of the firms are determined by the growth of the few large products . using the empirical values for the phid @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and assuming lognormality of the distributions @xmath67 and @xmath68 we find that the behavior of @xmath117 can be well approximated by a power law @xmath118 for @xmath119 . for this set of parameters ,",
    "the convergence of @xmath66 to a gaussian distribution takes place only for @xmath120 .",
    "this result is consistent with the observations of the power law relationship between firm size and growth rate variance reported earlier  @xcite .",
    "business firms grow by increasing their scale and scope .",
    "the scope of a firm is given by the number of its products .",
    "the scale of a firm is given by the size of its products .",
    "a firm like microsoft gets few big products while amazon sells a huge variety of goods , each of small size in terms of sales . in this article",
    "we argue that both mechanisms of growth are proportional .",
    "the number of products a firm can successfully launch is proportional to the number of products it has already commercialized . once a product has been launched its success depends on the number of customers who buy it and the price they are willing to pay . to a large extent ,",
    "if products are different enough , the success of a product is independent from other products commercialized by the same company .",
    "hence , the sales of products can be modeled as independent stochastic processes .",
    "moreover , sometimes , new products are commercialized by new companies . as a result , small companies with few products can experience sudden jerks of growth due to the successful launch of a new product .    in this article",
    ", we find that the empirical distribution of firm growth rates exhibits a central part which is distributed according to a laplace distribution and power - law wings @xmath2 where @xmath1 .",
    "if the distribution of number of units @xmath30 is dominated by single unit classes , the tails of firm growth rate are primarily due to smaller firms composed of one or few products .",
    "the laplace center of the distribution is shaped by big multiproduct firms .",
    "we find that the shape of the distribution of firm growth is almost the same in presence of a small entry rate and with zero entry .",
    "we also find that the model s predictions are accurate also in the case of product growth rates , which implies that products can be considered as composed by elementary sale units , which evolve according to a random multiplicative process @xcite .",
    "although there are several plausible explanations for the laplace body of the distribution  @xcite , the power law decay of the tails has not previously been observed .",
    "we introduce a simple and general model that accounts for both the central part and the tails of the distribution .",
    "the shape of the business growth rate distribution is due to the proportional growth of both the number and the size of the constituent units in the class .",
