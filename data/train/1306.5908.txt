    "ngc 2264 is among the best studied star formation regions .",
    "the ngc - designation simultaneously denotes a young , 3 myr old open cluster and an extended hii - region with some small molecular knots where star formation is still in progress @xcite .",
    "hundreds of pre - main sequence stars have been identified in this cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "signs of current formation of low - mass companion objects ( stellar or planetary objects ) can be found in this cluster , too ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the cluster is well studied at a broad wavelength range from x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , through visual and infrared wavelengths @xcite , to radio observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the cluster contains about 500 well - identified cluster members @xcite , but the true number of cluster members reaches @xmath0 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a very special and unique simultaneous time - series photometric study was carried out in near - infrared by spitzer , in x - ray by chandra and in optical by most and corot space satellites during the winter 2010/2011 .",
    "corot also observed this cluster in 2007/2008 for 30 days obtaining another set of ultraprecise time - series photometry @xcite .",
    "we used the 25 cm ground - based best ii ( berlin exoplanet search telescope ) in 2008/2009 to support the corot observations in two ways : to keep the validity of the ephemeris of several eclipsing binary stars and planetary candidates for future follow - up observations and to help the determination of possible variable contamination sources inside the corot photometric mask . since corot s photometric mask is large ( typically @xmath1 arcseconds ) due to a dispersion element in the optical path ,",
    "corot often measures the total flux from several light sources .",
    "therefore , the origin of the light variation is sometimes not the corot - target but one of the contaminating objects or the variation of the main corot - target is diluted by another star .",
    "our observations help to decide which one is the variable source if the amplitude of such variation is above our detection limit .",
    "similar observations for the same purpose were reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . since our observations on ngc 2264",
    "cover a whole season , time - series photometric data can also be used to investigate the photometric optical behaviour of the stars between the epochs of the two corot studies .    in this paper",
    "we present our study on the variable stars in ngc 2264 .",
    "section [ data ] presents the description of the telescope used and the observations .",
    "we report our flux measurements on the known variable stars , we confirm or reject the variability of several previously suspected variable stars as well as we report 920 new variable stars in and around ngc 2264 ( section [ variable_stars ] ) .",
    "in section [ yso ] we present a set of light curves of an interesting type of pre - main sequence stars .",
    "one similar light curve shape was found by @xcite , and here we add a selection of new examples to this rare variable star class .    in section  [ models ]",
    "we present the fitted models of 11 selected eclipsing binaries , while in section  [ others ] we discuss a set of interesting variable stars in our data set .",
    "in section  [ eclipsing ] we shall demonstrate that the observable frequency of algol - type eclipsing binaries is extremely high inside the cluster area compared to the field .",
    "we point out that there is no other possible explanation for this phenomenon but a well - determined , special orientation of the orbital planes of the binaries in the cluster , giving an additional , new constraint for the star formation theories .",
    "eventually the summary and conclusions of this paper can be found in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the observations were performed with the best ii telescope located at the observatorio cerro armazones , chile .",
    "the system consists of a takahashi 25 cm baker - ritchey - chrtien telescope equipped with a 4k @xmath2 4k finger lakes ccd .",
    "the corresponding field of view is @xmath3 with an angular resolution of @xmath4 pixel@xmath5 . in order to maximize the photon yield no filter was used .",
    "best ii observed the corot target field sra01 during a total of 50 nights between 2008 december 06 and 2009 february 10 . in order to cover the larger fov of corot completely , sra01",
    "was split into two best ii target fields that were observed alternately .",
    "these subfields are denoted sra01a and sra01b in the following .",
    "the acquired observations were processed using the best automated photometric pipeline as described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting datasets consist of 90,065 light curves of stellar objects in the corot sra01 field .",
    "since the corot satellite observed this field in 2007/2008 and 2010/2011 , our photometric data obtained in 2008 and 2009 are an excellent supplement for characterizing both short and long term variability , thus extending the corot observations .",
    "for detecting variable stars , we apply the efficient method described by @xcite .",
    "it is based on the widely - used variability index @xmath6 @xcite and a multiharmonic period search @xcite , but additionally involves an automatic treatment of systematic variability .",
    "all light curves with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) were fitted with seven harmonics and ranked using the modified analysis - of - variance statistic @xmath9 ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a cut - off limit was set to @xmath10 based on empirical experiments , yielding 1,805 variable star candidates ( 728 in sra01a , 1,077 in sra01b ) .",
    "all candidates were inspected visually and classified on an individual basis .",
    "we detected a total of 1,161 variable stars , of which 241 were previously known and 920 are new discoveries . the variable star catalogue and the observed light curves are presented here in table [ tab : varcat ] and figure [ fig : lc_sample ] , respectively , for guidance regarding its form and content .",

    "what makes it interesting is its mass ratio of @xmath211 .",
    "furthermore it exhibits the oconnell - effect ( @xmath212 mag ) which seems to be very stable during the observing run .",
    "the oconnell - effect is generally explained by strong stellar activity ( for an overview see * ? ? ?",
    "the temperature of the larger star ( @xmath213k , estimated from @xmath61 ) is higher than the temperature of the smaller secondary ( @xmath214k ) which is consistent with the h - subtype contact binary systems @xcite .",

    "if these parameters are realistic - which is the case if the system does not suffer from interstellar reddening - then these stars form very likely an dm1 + dm8 binary system .",
    "not also are such systems very rare , but also binarity among dm stars .",
    "that is why this system may serve as an important target for lower main sequence parameter studies @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy is needed to check its spectral type and the reddening effect .",
    "this algol - type binary has a strange light curve shape around the secondary minimum , where the brightness of the system increases significantly .",
    "this increase however is not stable ; during our observations it changes , resulting in a larger scatter at these phases .",
    "we modeled this feature successfully with a bright spot on the back side of the primary component .",
    "unfortunately , we did not find any @xmath61 color for this star and hence the light curve modeling results are uncertain .",
    "the system seems to consist of two equal stars close to each other , because the ellipsoidal effect is quite clear .",
    "although the two transit depths look similar ( indicating nearly equal surface temperatures ) , the ellipsoidal effect suggests a mass ratio of @xmath222 .",
    "therefore one of the stars may be an evolved object , because of its radius - excess .      this faint ( @xmath224 mag ) , common orbital period ( @xmath225 days ) contact binary star belongs to the a - subtype of contact binaries exhibiting a distinct oconnell - effect ( @xmath226 mag ) . to fit its light curve ,",
    "two spots were required , one very dark ( @xmath227 ) and one very bright ( @xmath228 ) , although this bright spot has a large uncertainty , see table [ tab : model_parameters ] ) .",

    "therefore this system should have an eccentricity of @xmath247 and @xmath248 meaning that we are viewing the system from the direction of periastron .",
    "sra01a_24280 is also an eccentric algol - type eclipsing binary system with @xmath250 days .",

    "there are @xmath299 known cluster members ( * ? ? ?",

    "we calculated the same ratio for the corot - field lra02 observed also by best ii @xcite .",
    "this field contains 115 eas among a total of 98,219 stars , which yields @xmath306 .",
    "given that we did not find any difference in the magnitude distribution for stars within and outside of the cluster , we regard this value as real .    in the field",
    "we can assume that the fraction of binary systems among all stars is around @xmath307 @xcite .",
    "if all the stars in ngc 2264 were located in binary systems we could expect a doubled number of eas in the cluster .",
    "this is , however , still 12 times smaller than what we observe .",
    "another possibility is that during the stellar and binary formation the systems preserve the original angular momentum vector of their parental cloud resulting in a more or less parallel orientation of the orbital planes of the binaries .",
    "we tried to separate the algols that belong to the cluster from the eclipsing binaries in the field to confirm that the observed excess is in the cluster and not in the field .",
    "we checked the proper motions of our stars using the ppmxl proper motion catalog @xcite . to calculate the probability of the eas we used the method described by @xcite .",
    "the probability that a given star belongs to the cluster can be calculated as    @xmath308    where @xmath309 and @xmath310 are the differences between the proper motion of a star and the average proper motion of the cluster member stars and @xmath311 and @xmath312 the standard deviations of the proper motions of the cluster member stars .",
    "the same equation can be used for the field membership ( @xmath313 ) but with the average proper motion of the field stars and their standard deviation .    since we do not know which ones are cluster members among our 90,065 stars , during the determination of the proper motion of the cluster we used the cluster members identified by @xcite .",
    "the average proper motion of the cluster is @xmath314 mas / year and @xmath315 mas / year .",
    "the average proper motion of the field is @xmath316 mas / year and @xmath317 mas / year based on all 90,065 stars .",
    "the normalized probability that a given star belongs to the cluster @xcite is :    @xmath318    the sum of these probabilities for all of the eas in the cluster area is 30.1 , which is the expected number of the cluster member eas .",
    "we were able to identify in the ppmxl catalogue only 87 out of the 92 eas , therefore this value is underestimated . using the ea frequency of @xmath319",
    "the expected value of field eas is 76.6 .",
    "since the total number of algols is 114 , it follows that the expected number of cluster member eas is @xmath320 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value we expect from the proper motion analysis .",
    "since the distance of the cluster is 900 pc , the proper motion values are small and hence it is difficult to select the cluster members individually .",
    "another way of selecting cluster members is via the use of a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the problem with this method however is that eas are binary stars and both the brightness and the color are affected by the companion .",
    "moreover , the ngc 2264 is a very young open cluster embedded in a dense interstellar cloud and this cloud produces a non - negligible absorption and reddening even in near - infrared @xmath6 , @xmath321 and @xmath322 bands .",
    "therefore , the de - reddened position of the eas in a color - magnitude diagram is doubtful .",
    "we compared the location of the cluster member stars @xcite and our eas in the @xmath323 - @xmath322 color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we shifted the binaries with the maximum value of 0.75 mag to correct for the additional intensity of the companion in case of two equally bright stars .",
    "46 eas are located in the same area as the cluster members , which is 25% higher than the number of expected eas in the cluster .",
    "the most accurate test would be to check the parallaxes of the stars , but , due to the large distance of the cluster , for sufficiently accurate parallaxes we have to wait for the results of the gaia satellite .",
    "in conclusion , based on both the proper motions and on the color - magnitude diagram there are a sufficient number of cluster member candidates in our ea sample to confirm the ea excess as an extreme excess of eclipsing binaries in ngc 2264 .",
    "the expected value of algols among the 2000 cluster members based on the algol frequency in the field is only 1.74 contrary to the 30.1 and 46 using the proper motions and the color - magnitude diagram , respectively .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the increased frequency os algols in the cluster area is due to the cluster members , because the chance of being only a random fluctuation in the field is extremely low . in order to explain the excess we modeled the fraction of observed algol type binaries .",
    "we assume an initial inclination ( @xmath324 ) and a scatter ( @xmath325 ) with a normal distribution .",
    "it is possible to calculate the theoretical fraction of eas in the field and in the cluster using only basic physical equations and empirical relations .",
    "we assume the period distribution as follows : @xmath326 where @xmath327 is a random variable distributed uniformly over the range [ 0,1 ] . since there are only a few eas with an orbital period less than 1 day @xcite we remove the binary stars with @xmath328 day , and taken into account only stars with longer periods .",
    "in our sample there are only 6 eas with a period shorter than 1 day . for longer periods",
    "this distribution is appropriate .",
    "the mass distribution is : @xmath329 where @xmath330 is another random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "finally the mass ratio is : @xmath331 where @xmath332 is a third random number also uniformly distributed in [ 0,1 ] .",
    "we use only circular orbits ( @xmath333 ) .",
    "relations [ eq : period_distr ] - [ eq : mass_ratio ] were taken from @xcite .",
    "the mass - radius relation was @xcite : @xmath334    we see an eclipse , if @xmath335 where @xmath67 is the inclination of the orbital plane and @xmath336 is the critical inclination .",
    "@xmath336 can be expressed as : @xmath337 where @xmath59 is the semi - major axis of the orbit .",

    "first , we simulate the algol - type variables with a uniformly distributed angular momentum unit vector in space . using a monte carlo simulation",
    ", we generated 50,000 binary systems with the parameter distribution described above and a distribution of the inclinations varying as : @xmath342 where @xmath343 is another random number uniformly distributed in [ 0,1 ] .",
    "assuming @xmath307 of binary systems , this model yields an @xmath344 fraction of eclipsing binaries .",
    "there are two more factors that influence the observability of these systems .",
    "one is the depth of the eclipse .",
    "there are many grazing eclipsing systems with very small amplitudes . in our sample",
    "all the eclipsing systems have at least 0.04 mag deep eclipses , so we set the lower limit to 0.04 mag .",
    "the depth of the eclipse is calculated without taking into account the limb darkening .",
    "the other factor comes from the epochs of the observations itself .",
    "if an algol - type system has an orbital period of e.g. 2.0 days but the eclipses appear in the daytime we have no chance to observe them .",
    "therefore , we calculated the fractional phase coverage as a function of orbital period .",
    "this function gives the probability that we observe at least one eclipse in our dataset .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ observability ] .",
    "the calculation takes periods until @xmath345 days into account .",
    "then instead of counting the eas with at least 0.04 mag amplitude and @xmath346 day , we summarize these probabilities for the detectable binaries .",
    "finally the relative frequency of the observable algol type systems in our dataset is @xmath347 .",
    "this is acceptably close to the observed value of @xmath348 . for fainter stars the limiting eclipse depth of 0.04 mag",
    "is somewhat underestimated .",
    "if we set the limiting amplitude to 0.1 mag the observable frequency is @xmath349 , and thus not significantly different .",
    "the observed fraction of algols in ngc 2264 , however , is @xmath350 , more than 20 times higher .",
    "if all stars were binaries , this could increase the field s frequency to @xmath351 inside the cluster but not to @xmath352 .",
    "this leads us to suggest that the inclinations can not be isotropically distributed inside the cluster . using our model we can check whether there is a combination of the initial inclination and a scatter around it that can reproduce this high fraction .",
    "therefore we run a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the inclinations are taken as follows : @xmath353 where @xmath324 is a random number uniformly distributed in [ 0@xmath68,90@xmath68 ] and @xmath355 is another random number normally distributed around 0@xmath68 with @xmath355 standard deviation in [ 0@xmath68,45@xmath68 ] .    ) with an initial inclination @xmath324 and a standard deviation @xmath325 around @xmath324 .",

    "[ binary_fraction_map ] . both panels of this figure",
    "are based on a monte carlo simulation of 10,000 inclination distributions described in eq .",
    "[ eq : i_0 ] . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ binary_fraction_map ] we plot the whole modeled range , while in the bottom panel we zoom into the right bottom corner region . as one can see , there is only a very small region where the fraction of detectable eas is around @xmath360 , our measured value .",
    "so the average inclination of the ngc 2264 should be above @xmath361 and the standard deviation is less than @xmath362 .",
    "practically we see the cluster s eclipsing binaries edge on .",
    "there are two possible solutions for the origin of this distribution .",
    "first , there may be a physical mechanism that uniformises the angular momentum vector distribution inside the cluster .",
    "second , and more likely , the original direction of the angular momentum vector of the cloud from which the cluster was formed was conserved even if the total amount of the angular momentum was decreased during the star formation process .",
    "the parallel orientation of the outflows in star forming regions also supports this scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    although the suggested common inclination distribution has some implications on the star formation processes , it is out the scope of this paper to investigate which star formation theory includes the conservation of the direction of the angular momentum vector .",
    "the proposed strict inclination distribution of the binaries may explain also the lack of eclipsing binaries in the pleiades @xcite .",
    "in the lower left part of the top panel of fig .",
    "[ binary_fraction_map ] the fraction of observable eclipsing binaries is practically 0 , although about 2/3 of the stars in the pleiades are binaries @xcite .",
    "these results also have an important consequence for transiting exoplanet searching surveys .",
    "if we can assume that the same process works for planet formation as for multiple star formation including the kozai - mechanism @xcite and the planets remain in the same orbital plane for longer timescales , one is unlikely to find any transiting exoplanet in open clusters that do not contain eclipsing binaries .",
    "thus the more favourable targets for transit searches are eclipsing binary - rich clusters .",
    "we presented a study of the variable stars in and around the young open cluster ngc 2264 observed by best ii in 2008/2009 .",
    "we detected 1,161 variable stars out of 90,065 stars in our field of view .",
    "only 241 of these stars were previously reported as variables , 920 are newly detected .",
    "we collected a set of young stellar objects with unusual light curves .",
    "a similar light curve was already found by @xcite , but our amplitudes are smaller and the periods are shorter .",
    "the large number of such objects is maybe due to the extreme distribution of the direction of angular momentum vectors ( see sect .  [ eclipsing ] ) .",
    "investigating the spatial distribution of the algol - type eclipsing binaries in the field we found that the fraction of these binaries is extremely high in the cluster .",
    "the incidence of these systems is 25 times more frequent than outside the cluster among the field stars .",
    "we checked whether this excess is real and we found that the probability of it being a statistical fluctuation is extremely low .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the excess is caused by the algols inside the cluster .",
    "we also searched for the origin of the excess and we concluded that the number of cluster member candidate eas is in very good agreement with our assumption .",
    "this feature can be explained if we assume that the angular momentum vectors of the orbital motions are directed anisotropically .",
    "this direction originates most likely from the original angular vector of the parental cloud . in the case of ngc 2264 , the average inclination of the orbital planes should be more than @xmath361 with a standard deviation less than @xmath362 .",
    "this model can explain also the lack of eclipsing binaries in the pleiades .",
    "if the inclination of a cluster is low enough , we can not see any eclipsing binaries even if the scatter of the inclinations is higher .",

    "<S> time - series photometry of the corot field sra01 was carried out with the berlin exoplanet search telescope ii ( best ii ) in 2008/2009 . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 1,161 variable stars were detected , of which 241 were previously known and 920 are newly found . </S>",
    "<S> several new , variable young stellar objects have been discovered . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the spatial distribution of eclipsing binaries revealed the higher relative frequency of algols toward the center of the young open cluster ngc 2264 . </S>",
    "<S> in general algol frequency obeys an isotropic distribution of their angular momentum vectors , except inside the cluster , where a specific orientation of the inclinations is the case . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that we see the orbital plane of the binaries almost edge - on .    </S>",
