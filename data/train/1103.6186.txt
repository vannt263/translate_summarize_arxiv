    "the critical endpoint , cp , of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite is one of the most important aspects of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "it is thus not surprising that an intense experimental activity is nowadays dedicated to the detection of such a point , which involves the large facilities at rhic and lhc ; moreover , further experiments are expected after the development of fair at gsi .",
    "several theoretical signatures of cp have been suggested  @xcite . despite the importance of cp , a firm theoretical evidence of its existence is still missing .",
    "in fact , the sign problem makes the lattice monte carlo simulations difficult , if not impossible , in the large baryon - chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) region for @xmath2  @xcite , see  @xcite for a recent review .",
    "therefore , it has not yet been possible to prove unambiguously the existence and the location of cp starting from first principles simulations of grand - canonical ensembles .",
    "the strong coupling expansion of lattice qcd  @xcite seems promising .",
    "even more , the predictions of effective models are spread in the @xmath3 plane , see for example  @xcite .",
    "an interesting overcoming of the sign problem for the quest of cp is offered by analytic continuation of data obtained at imaginary chemical potential , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "recent promising analysis shows that it might be possible to continue the critical line from the region of imaginary @xmath1 to that of real @xmath1  @xcite , pinning down the critical point .",
    "another fruitful approach is given by simulations at finite isospin chemical potential , @xmath5 , see for example  @xcite . even in this case , a critical endpoint there appears before the transition to the pion condensed phase .",
    "the latter point has been overlooked and it has not yet been detected by mean field model calculations ; hence it certainly deserves further study .",
    "it is also worth to cite the possibility to perform simulations in canonical , rather then grand - canonical , ensembles .",
    "preliminary results in this direction have been presented recently in  @xcite . on the purely theoretical side ,",
    "it has been suggested very recently  @xcite that the use of orbifold equivalence in the large @xmath6 approximation of qcd can lead to relations between the coordinates of cp at finite chemical potential , with those at finite isospin chemical potential .    in this article , we suggest a new , theoretical way to detect the cp , by means of lattice simulations with @xmath7 , which can be considered as an alternative to the @xmath4 technique . in order to accomplish this important program , we suggest to simulate qcd with a chiral chemical potential , @xmath0 , conjugated to the chiral charge density , @xmath8 , see  @xcite for previous studies .",
    "our idea , supported by concrete calculations within microscopic effective models , is that cp can be _ continued _ to a critical endpoint at @xmath9 and @xmath10 , that we denote by cp@xmath11 , the latter being accessible to @xmath7 lattice qcd simulations of grand - canonical ensembles  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of the former endpoint via lattice simulations , can be considered as a signal of the existence of the latter . to facilitate exposition",
    ", we introduce the symbol @xmath12 to denote the world with @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    ", we will use the symbol @xmath14 to denote the world with @xmath15 , and which corresponds to the physical universe .    the model calculations , in particular the ones based on the nambu - jona - lasinio model with the polyakov loop  @xcite ( pnjl model in the following ) with tree level coupling among chiral condensate and polyakov loop  @xcite , give numerical relations among the coordinates of cp@xmath11 and those of cp .",
    "in particular , the critical temperature turns out to be almost unaffected by the process of continuation ; the critical value of the chemical potential , @xmath16 , on the other hand turns out to be almost half of the critical chiral chemical potential , @xmath17 .    before discussing our results , it is important to spend some word more about the chiral chemical potential . in particular , we are aware that @xmath12 should be considered as a fictional universe . as a matter of fact , @xmath0 can not be considered as a true chemical potential because , in the confinement phase , the chiral condensate @xmath18 mixes left- and right - handed components of the quark field , leading to non - conservation of @xmath19 .",
    "this statement is true also in the quark - gluon - plasma phase , where the chiral condensate is much smaller than its value in the confinement phase ; in this case , the non - conservation of @xmath19 is much softer , and mainly due to the bare quark mass , @xmath20 with @xmath21 corresponding to the temperature of the heath bath in which the fields live .",
    "therefore , the point of view that we adopt in this article is to consider @xmath0 as a mere mathematical artifice .",
    "however , @xmath12 with @xmath7 can be simulated on the lattice",
    ". therefore , for the continuity property cited above , it is worth to study it by grand - canonical ensemble simulations : it might furnish an evidence of the existence of the critical endpoint in the real world .",
    "furthermore , once cp@xmath11 is detected , it might be possible to make use of lattice simulations to detect inhomogeneous phases  @xcite which could develop around cp@xmath11 , as a continuation of those which develop at cp .",
    "the results would then be of vital importance to understand , for example , the inner structure of compact stellar objects .",
    "for the aforementioned reasons , this study is very far from being of purely academic or theoretical interest .",
    "because of its non - perturbative nature , we can not make first principles calculations within qcd in the regimes to which we are interested in , namely moderate @xmath21 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 . hence we need to rely on some effective model , which is built in order to respect ( at least some of ) the symmetries of the qcd action . to this end , we make use of the celebrated quark - meson model  @xcite , and of the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite ( see  @xcite for reviews ) improved with the polyakov loop  @xcite , dubbed pnjl model , which have been used many times in recent years to describe successfully the thermodynamics of qcd with two and two - plus - one flavors , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "they are interesting because they allow for a self - consistent description of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ; even more , in the case the model is improved with the polyakov loop , it allows for a simultaneous computation of quantities sensible to confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .    in this section",
    "we describe both of the models .",
    "we firstly discuss the quark - meson model that we use in our computation , which is simpler to implement since take its simplest version , without the complications due to the finite value of the quark masses and to the polyakov loop .",
    "this is an useful preparation to the more important case of the pnjl model , which is more trustable quantitatively since it is tuned to reproduce lattice data at zero and imaginary chemical potential .",
    "the quark - meson ( qm ) model consists of the @xmath22 linear sigma model coupled to dynamical quarks via a yukawa - type interaction .",
    "the lagrangian density is given by @xmath23 q \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_\\mu\\sigma\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_\\mu\\bm\\pi\\right)^2 - u(\\sigma,\\bm\\pi)~. \\label{eq : ld1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath24 corresponds to a quark field in the fundamental representation of color group @xmath25 and flavor group @xmath26 ; besides , @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the scalar singlet and the pseudo - scalar iso - triplet fields , respectively .",
    "we have a introduced chemical potential for the quark number density , @xmath1 , and a pseudo - chemical potential conjugated to chirality imbalance , @xmath0 .",
    "we explain in some detail the physical meaning of the latter .",
    "the quantity conjugated to @xmath0 , namely the chiral charge density , is given by @xmath29 , and represents the difference in densities of the right- and left - handed quarks .",
    "at finite @xmath0 , a chirality imbalance is created , namely @xmath30 .",
    "for example , in the massless limit and at zero baryon",
    "chemical potential one has  @xcite @xmath31 if quark mass ( bare or constituent ) is taken into account , the relation @xmath32 can not be found analytically in the general case , and a numerical investigation is needed , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the imbalance of chiral density can be created by instanton / sphaleron transition in qcd , see  @xcite and references therein . as a matter of fact ,",
    "non perturbative background gluon configurations with nonzero winding number , @xmath33 , change the chirality of quarks according to the ward identity : @xmath34 as a consequence , the addition of @xmath0 to the lagrangian density of the chiral models mimics the instanton / sphaleron induced chirality transitions .",
    "the potential @xmath35 describes tree - level interactions among the meson fields . in this article",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the qm model in the chiral limit for simplicity , and take @xmath36 which is invariant under the chiral group .",
    "we work in the one - loop approximation , which amounts to consider mesons as classical fields , and integrate only over fermions in the generating functional of the theory to obtain the quantum effective potential ( qep ) . in the integration process , the meson fields are fixed to their classical expectation values , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the physical value of @xmath39 will be then determined by minimization of the qep .",
    "the field @xmath27 has the quantum numbers of the qcd chiral condensate , @xmath18 .",
    "hence its non - vanishing expectation value breaks chiral symmetry spontaneously , mimicking the chiral symmetry breaking of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the one - loop qep in presence of @xmath0 has been discussed several times  @xcite .",
    "the addition of the @xmath40dependence is a textbook matter .",
    "the final result is @xmath41 where @xmath42 corresponds to the pole of the quark propagator , and @xmath43 is the constituent quark mass ; finally , the index @xmath44 denotes the helicity projection .",
    "in right hand side of the first line of equation   the momentum integral corresponds to the vacuum quark fluctuations contribution to the qep .",
    "it is divergent , and it gives a contribution at @xmath45 and @xmath9 . for our purposes , it is enough to treat the model as an effective description of the infrared regime of qcd .",
    "therefore we treat the divergence phenomenologically , introducing a momentum cutoff , @xmath46 , in the vacuum term .",
    "this is equivalent to introduce a momentum - dependent quark mass , which is nonzero and constant for momenta lower than the cutoff , and zero for larger values of momenta , thus realizing a rough approximation of the effective ( momentum - dependent and ultraviolet suppressed ) quark mass of full qcd  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the model are tuned as in  @xcite .",
    "they are chosen in order to satisfy the requirements that @xmath47 in the vacuum , @xmath48 and @xmath49 mev , where @xmath50 moreover , the constituent quark mass in the vacuum is fixed to the value @xmath51 mev , which allows to fix the numerical value of @xmath52 with @xmath53 mev .",
    "finally , the ultraviolet cutoff is taken @xmath54 mev .",
    "this procedure fixes @xmath55 and @xmath56 mev@xmath57 .      in the pnjl model ,",
    "quark propagation in the medium is described by the following lagrangian density : @xmath58 here @xmath24 is the quark dirac spinor in the fundamental representation of the flavor @xmath26 and the color group ; @xmath59 correspond to the pauli matrices in flavor space .",
    "a sum over color and flavor is understood .",
    "the covariant derivative embeds the qcd coupling with the background gluon field which is related to the polyakov loop , see below .",
    "furthermore , we have defined @xmath60~.\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ]    one advantage to use the pnjl model is that it has access to the expectation value of the polyakov loop , that we denote by @xmath61 , which is sensible to confinement or deconfinement properties of a given phase . in order to compute @xmath61",
    "we introduce a static , homogeneous and euclidean background temporal gluon field , @xmath62 , coupled minimally to the quarks via the qcd covariant derivative  @xcite",
    ". then @xmath63 where @xmath64 . in the polyakov gauge , which is convenient for this study , @xmath65",
    "; moreover , for simplicity we take @xmath66 from the beginning as in  @xcite , which implies @xmath67 .",
    "we have then @xmath68 for our purpose , that is mainly the location of the critical endpoint , we expect that the approximation @xmath66 is sufficient ; as a matter of fact , we have verified that in this case we reproduce , at finite @xmath1 , the location of the critical endpoint obtained in  @xcite , where the same parametrization of the model is used , and where @xmath69 from the beginning .    in our computation",
    "we follow the idea implemented in  @xcite , which brings to a polyakov - loop - dependent coupling constant : @xmath70~,\\label{eq : run}\\ ] ] the ansatz in the above equation was inspired by  @xcite in which it was shown explicitly that the njl vertex can be derived in the infrared limit of qcd , it has a non - local structure , and it acquires a non - trivial dependence on the phase of the polyakov loop .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "this idea has been analyzed recently in  @xcite , where the effect of the confinement order parameter on the four - fermion interactions and their renormalization - group fixed - point structure has been investigated .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 have been fixed in  @xcite by a best fit of the available lattice data at zero and imaginary chemical potential of ref .",
    "in particular , the fitted data are the critical temperature at zero chemical potential , and the dependence of the roberge - weiss endpoint on the bare quark mass .",
    "the best fit procedure leads to @xmath73 , within the hard cutoff regularization scheme , which is the same scheme that we adopt in this article .",
    "in the one - loop approximation , the effective potential of this model is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 denote the statistical confining thermal contributions to the effective potential ; @xmath76 is still given by equation  , with @xmath77 .",
    "once again the vacuum fluctuation term is regularized by means of a ultraviolet cutoff , that we denote by @xmath46 .",
    "the relation between the chiral condensate and @xmath27 in the pnjl model is @xmath78 .",
    "we notice that in this case we take quarks with a finite bare mass , which will be fixed by requiring that the pion mass in the vacuum is in agreement with its experimental value .",
    "we also notice that the pnjl model considered here , which is dubbed extended - pnjl in  @xcite , has been tuned in order to reproduce quantitatively the lattice qcd thermodynamics at zero and imaginary quark chemical potential .",
    "hence , it represents a faithful description of qcd , in terms of collective degrees of freedom related to chiral symmetry breaking and deconfinement .",
    "the potential term @xmath79 in eq .",
    "is built by hand in order to reproduce the pure gluonic lattice data with @xmath80  @xcite .",

    "the models considered here and in  @xcite are different : the zero point energy is not taken into account in  @xcite , and on the other hand we do not include the polyakov loop in our qm model calculations . for these reasons , it is not necessary to have a quantitative agreement among our results and those of  @xcite . on the contrary , it is important to notice that the qualitative picture is the same , namely the existence of a critical endpoint in the @xmath97 plane .    in both of the aforementioned studies , the quark chemical potential @xmath1 has not been taken into account . therefore , the possibility to continue cp@xmath11 to cp , which is the main idea of the study illustrated in this article , was not considered in those references .",
    "in this article , we have suggested the possibility of continuation of the critical endpoint of the phase diagram of @xmath7 qcd , cp , to a critical endpoint dubbed cp@xmath11 belonging to a fictional world , @xmath12 , in which the quark number chemical potential is replaced by a pseudo - chemical potential , @xmath0 conjugated to the chiral charge density , @xmath19 . the universe @xmath12 has the merit that it can be simulated on the lattice  @xcite for @xmath7 .",
    "this suggestion is based on concrete calculations within chiral models . in particular , we have used the pnjl model with entanglement vertex , introduced in  @xcite , which offers a description of the qcd thermodynamics in terms of collective degrees of freedom , which is in quantitative agreement with lattice data at zero and imaginary chemical potential .",
    "our main idea is that simulations in @xmath12 might reveal the existence of a critical endpoint , cp@xmath11 , in the phase diagram .",
    "then , this critical point might be interpreted as the continuation of the critical point which is expected to belong to the phase diagram of real qcd , because of the continuity summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ev ] .",
    "hence it would be an indirect evidence of the existence of the critical point in real qcd .",
    "moreover , numerical predictions of the model , which connect cp to cp@xmath11 , are in equation  . for these reasons ,",
    "the interest of the present study is very far from being only academic or purely theoretical .",
    "our result paves the way of the mapping of the phases of quantum chromodynamics at finite @xmath1 , by virtue of the phases of a fictitious theory in which @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath0 .    in our calculations",
    "there are some factors that we have not included for simplicity , and that might be interesting to include in more complete calculations ( massive quarks , vector interactions , just to cite a couple of examples ) . in view of a possible mapping of the phase diagram of qcd using simulations of grand - canonical ensembles in @xmath12 ,",
    "it is of great interest to extend the analysis of  @xcite about inhomogeneous condensates , to cp@xmath11 .",
    "moreover , in our opinion it is important to understand quantitatively how the numerical predictions of the model , namely equation  , are affected by varying the quark masses , and introducing a third flavor .",
    "we plan to report on these topics in the next future .",
