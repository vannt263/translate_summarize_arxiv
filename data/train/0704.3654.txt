    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs)the most energetic event in the universe  are considered to be due to the death of massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , grbs are closely associated with the star formation of host galaxies .",
    "since grbs can be detected at cosmological distances ( the current record is @xmath14 for grb050904 ; @xcite ) , they are expected to be probes of the star formation history of the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to determine the use of grbs , it is essential to understand the star - formation activity of their hosts .",
    "multiwavelength observations have shown that grb hosts are typically blue , sub - luminous dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) with low metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation rates ( sfrs ) determined from optical / uv observations are @xmath15110 @xmath16 . on the other hand , submillimeter and",
    "radio continuum observations indicate that some grb hosts are dusty and have massively star forming properties ( sfr @xmath15 several 100 @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "there is a wide discrepancy between the sfrs derived from optical / uv and those from submillimeter / radio .",
    "mid - ir observations further complicate the situation ; only a small fraction of grb hosts are detected at mid - ir wavelengths in contrast with the image of submillimeter / radio observations @xcite .",
    "these methods for deriving the sfrs each have their own drawbacks . because optical / uv bands are subject to dust extinction and therefore the sfrs",
    "may be underestimated .",
    "mid - ir , far - ir , and radio continuum are susceptible to contamination from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the sfrs derived from submillimeter continuum have uncertainties in the assumption of the dust temperature and emission spectrum .    in order to solve these problems , it is necessary to derive the sfrs in a method which is independent of existing methods and not affected by dust extinction and agns . for this purpose ,",
    "an effective method is to observe the co line .",
    "the co line traces molecular gas , which is a fuel for star formation .",
    "thus far , the search for co ( @xmath1 = 10 ) emission from the host galaxy of grb030329 using the nobeyama millimeter array @xcite has been reported as the only attempt in this regard .",
    "however , only upper limits of the molecular gas mass and sfr of the host galaxy have been obtained .",
    "since current instruments have limitations , it appears that target selection is essential to detect co line emission .    in this paper",
    ", we report on observations of the @xmath1 = 32 transition line of @xmath0co in the host galaxy of grb980425 using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste : @xcite ) .",

    "its isotropic @xmath17-ray energy of @xmath15@xmath18 erg is significantly less than that of typical grbs by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy termed eso184-g82 ( figure [ fig : grbhost ] ) is the nearest grb host known to date .",
    "the redshift of @xmath19 @xcite is extremely low among grb hosts ( the mean redshift is @xmath20 ; @xcite ) . due to the proximity",
    ", it is the best target to detect co line emission . the host galaxy is a blue , sub - luminous , and low - metallicity star - forming galaxy ( see table [ tab : grbhost ] ) .",
    "sfr is derived from previous h@xmath13 , mid - ir , and hard x - ray observations as @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath23 @xcite respectively .",
    "the discrepancy between the sfrs derived from the x - ray and h@xmath13 observations implies that the host galaxy contains a large amount of molecular gas .",
    "the detection of co line emission is simplified by the fact that the galaxy has one of the highest values of metallicity[log(o / h)+12 ] = 8.6 @xcite  among grb hosts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
