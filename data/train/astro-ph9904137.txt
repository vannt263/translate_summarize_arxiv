    "finally , in sect.5 we discuss the results obtained and compare them to the results for related objects .",
    "we have obtained spectra of iras04296 with the ccd ( 1140@xmath71170 pixels ) equipped echelle spectrometer pfes mounted at the prime focus of the 6 m telescope of sao ras ( panchuk et al .",
    "1998 ) . the echelle - grating with @xmath8 and with a blaze angle of @xmath9 was used .",
    "a diffracton grating with @xmath10 was used as the cross - disperser .",
    "the camera has f=140 mm .",
    "the projected angular size of the input slit is 0.54arc sec .",
    "we observed iras04296 on october 07 , 1996 ( jd2450363.6 ) and february 26 , 1997 ( jd2450506.3 ) .",
    "the echelle frames with 25 echelle - orders cover the spectral region @xmath114420 - 8300 .",
    "the average spectral resolution was 0.4 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio was in the range 50110 for different spectral orders .",
    "all usual procedures needed for echelle - images reduction ( bias subtraction , cosmic ray removal , optimal order extraction , rebinning ) were made using the echelle context of the midas system .",
    "a gaussian function approximation was made for the measurement of equivalent widths .",
    "the comparison spectrum source was an argon - filled thorium hollow - cathode lamp .",
    "the distinctive features of the optical spectrum of the source iras04296 are a peculiar profile of the @xmath12 line ( see fig.[hi ] ) , molecular emission bands and very strong absorption lines of ionized atoms of s  process elements ( y , zr , ba , la , ce , pr , nd ) . for example , the equivalent widths of baii lines ( 6141 and 6496 ) exceed 0.6 .",
    "absorptional bands of several molecules ( @xmath1 , cn , tio , etc . ) are often present in the spectra of post - agb stars ( see , for example , hrivnak  1995 ; bakker et al .",
    "however , molecular _ emission _ features are only very rarely observed in the optical spectra of ppne .",
    "one such example is rafgl2688 ( the egg nebula ) for which crampton et al .",
    "( 1975 ) observed emission features of the @xmath0 molecule in a medium resolution spectrum . on the other hand , it is well known that cometary nuclei spectra show prominent swan band emission .    in both spectra of iras04296",
    "we have discovered strong _ emission _ in the ( 0;0 ) and ( 0;1 ) bands of the swan system of the @xmath0 molecule . on figs .",
    "[ swan1][swan3 ] we present a comparison between the spectrum of iras04296 ( observed on february , 26 , 1997 ) and that of the hale - bopp comet ( observed on march 30 , 1997 with the same spectrometer ) around bands ( 0;1 ) , ( 0;0 ) and ( 1;0 ) , respectively . from figs .",
    "[ swan1][swan3 ] it is clear that emission band ( 1;0 ) at 4735  is absent in the spectrum of iras04296 while the bands ( 0;1 ) at 5635  and ( 0;0 ) at 5165  are reliably measured .",
    "hrivnak  ( 1995 ) obtained the spectrum of iras04296 inside the blue spectral region , 38724870 , therefore he could not observe emission features of @xmath1 at 5165 and 5635 .    to understand the observed ratios between different bands ,",
    "we have estimated the temperature function for monochromatic coefficient of absorption per molecule ( @xmath13 ) for the swan bands in the `` just overlapping '' approximation ( joa , golden  1967 ) . for the microturbulent velocity @xmath14 this approximation works well near the band heads .",
    "values of @xmath13 for band heads of ( 0;0 ) at 5165   and ( 1;0 ) at 4735  coincide within 0.2dex for the temperatures range 30007000k , while @xmath13 for the band ( 0;1 ) at 5635   is systemically lower by about 0.6dex .",
    "taking into account these relations between @xmath13 s for different band heads and since we do not observe the 4735 band in rafgl2688 and iras04296 , we can conclude that it is impossible to describe the intensity ratios of @xmath1 emission bands for these objects by means of an equilibrium vibrational temperature in the 30007000k range .    to explain emission bands intensities for comets the mechanism of resonance fluorescence has been proposed ( zanstra  1928 , swings  1941 ) . in that case population of vibration ",
    "rotational levels for the molecule is described by the boltzmann approximation , however the value of _ t _ in the exponent no longer has the meaning of equilibrium temperature but it is a distribution parameter only .",
    "we suggest that the same mechanism could be responsible for the observed emission bands of iras04296 .",
    "however , it is clear from figs .",
    "[ swan1][swan3 ] that there are significant differences in the equivalent widths of the emission bands in the spectra of our supergiant and of the hale ",
    "bopp comet nucleus .",
    "they could be explained by a difference of radiation fluxes which illuminate @xmath1 molecules in these objects .",
    "the temperature of iras04296 ( @xmath15 around 6300k ) is sufficiently higher than that for the sun , therefore the band ( 1,0 ) at 4735 for iras04296 should be stronger than that for the hale - bopp comet nuclei .",
    "however , fig.[swan3 ] shows the opposite behaviour .",
    "it could mean that radiation field of iras04296 which excites the @xmath0 molecules is strongly reddened by matter located between its photosphere and the region which produces the @xmath16 emission .    together with the emission bands of the swan system ( klochkova et al .",
    "1997b ) absorption bands of the phillips system ( 1:0 ) , ( 2;0 ) , ( 3;0 ) have been revealed in the spectrum of iras04296 ( bakker et al .",
    "let us try to explain this phenomenon within the resonance fluorescence mechanism ordinary used to interpret comets spectra .",
    "as a first approximation , we assume that the vibrational distribution corresponds to the effective temperature of the star illuminating a circumstellar envelope if vibrational transitions in the low triplet state of a homonuclear molecule are strictly forbidden .",
    "but even when interpreting comets spectra such an approach appears to be too poor .",
    "the intensity distributions for different systems of bands and for bands of individual systems of the resonance fluorescence of the @xmath0 molecule have been considered in papers by krishna swamy & odell  ( 1977 , 1979 , 1981 ) .",
    "the intensities of bands have been calculated taking into account the excitation of the swan , ballick - ramsay and fox - herzberg triplet systems , phillips and milliken singlet systems as well as singlet - triplet transitions in low states .",
    "it has been shown , in particular , that at the value of the moment of singlet - triplet transitions @xmath17 and at the heliocentric distance of a comet d=1a.u .",
    "the ratios of intensities of sequences @xmath18 in the phillips system to the intensity of sequence @xmath19 of the swan system is equal to 0.094 , 0.11 and 0.04 , correspondingly ( krishna swamy & odell  1981 ) .",
    "this agrees well with results of measurement of comets spectra . using these results of krishna swamy & odell  ( 1981 )",
    ", we may suppose that the intensity of main bands of the swan system is ten times higher than that in the phillips system .",
    "now consider the case of iras04296 .",
    "let us add such an emission spectrum of the @xmath0 on the stellar continuum .",
    "in order to observe the emission bands of both the swan and the phillips systems over the continuum in such a combined spectrum , the stellar flux at @xmath20 = 5165 must be at least 10 times higher than near @xmath20=7720 .",
    "from kurucz s  ( 1979 ) tables it follows that the ratio of the fluxes near these wavelenghts for the sun ( the emitter in the case of comets ) is equal to @xmath21 . for the model with @xmath15",
    "= 6300k this ratio is equal to @xmath22 . from the real spectral energy distrubution",
    "observed for iras04296 ( kwok  1993 ) the ratio of the fluxes is essentially smaller : @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the conditions to observe the absorption bands of the phillips system and the emission bands of the swan system may arise inside the circumstellar envelope of iras04296 .",
    "we measured the radial velocity @xmath24 using our best spectrum , that obtained in february , 1997 .",
    "the average value of the radial velocity from numerous metal lines ( @xmath25 ) and from the @xmath26 absorption line ( @xmath27 ) agree within the accuracy of measurement .",
    "this radial velocity is consistent with a membership of an old population as suggested by the low metallicity ( see table1 ) .",
    "it should be noted also that the value of radial velocity we derived agrees with the value of @xmath28 which was given by omont et al .",
    "( 1993 ) from co data and @xmath29 by decin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from optical spectrum .",
    "there is still no sign of an essential temporal variability of @xmath30 for the object .",
    "from comparison of observed and synthetic spectra of iras04296 we discovered some strong absorptional features whose positions coincide with known diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) ( jenniskens et al .",
    "1994 ) . in fig.[dib ]",
    "we illustrate the presence of dib s by showing a spectral region of iras04296 . we have calculated the synthetic spectrum using the code starsp ( tsymbal  1995 ) and the atmospheric parameters and abundances of chemical elements we here obtained .",
    "it should be noted that for such a comparison in the spectral range near @xmath31 6270 - 6310 the telluric spectrum has been removed from the observed spectrum .    in the following paper",
    "we plan to study in detail such identified with dib s absorptions , we have revealed in the spectra of several related objects ( iras04296 , iras23304 + 6147 , iras222223 + 4327 ) , here we limited ourself by such short information .",
    "for understanding of an object at an advanced evolutionary stage , it is very important to know its metallicity and detailed chemical abundance pattern .",
    "our echelle spectra provide such a possibility due to their large wavelengths coverage .",
    "to study the chemical composition , we have used the plane - parallel homogeneous models generated by the marcs program ( gustafsson et al.1975 ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that unstable and very extended atmospheres of supergiants probably require more advanced model atmospheres .",
    "therefore , our results should be treated as only preliminary ones . for a chemical composition calculation by the model atmosphere method",
    ", one needs to know the values of the effective temperature ( @xmath15 ) , surface gravity ( logg ) and microturbulent velocity ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "determination of @xmath15 is problematic even for normal supergiants due to their extended atmospheres and significant non - lte effects . in the case of",
    "so peculiar a supergiant as iras04296 , for which the energy distribution is strongly distorted by interstellar and circumstellar extinction , determination of @xmath15 is the most difficult problem .",
    "we can not use for this purpose equivalent widths and profiles of hi lines ( well known criteria of atmospheric conditions for normal supergiants ) , since these lines are strongly distorted in the spectrum of iras04296 as seen in fig.[hi ] .",
    "therefore , we have applied the spectroscopic method for temperature determination of iras04296 , forcing the abundance derived for each line to be independent of the lower excitation potential ( ep ) .",
    "we have estimated that @xmath15 = 6300k with an internal uncertainty @xmath33@xmath15 = 250k . to check the realiability of our determination we have modelled the spectral energy distribution for this source ( see sect.4 ) and got a very similar temperature near 6500k .",
    "the surface gravity logg=0.0 was estimated through the ionization balance of the fei and feii abundances .",
    "the errors on the parameter logg is determined by forcing a maximum difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 to be 0.1dex ( where here and hereafter , @xmath36 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the hydrogen abundance @xmath37=12 .",
    "such a difference is achieved by varying the logg value by @xmath38 keeping other parameters ( @xmath15 and @xmath39 ) constant .",
    "the microturbulent velocity value based on equivalent widths ( w ) of fei and feii lines is quite high , equal to 7km / s .",
    "this value is determined with an uncertainty of @xmath40 , which is typical for f , g  supergiants .    to illustrate the choice of model parameters for the object iras04296 in the fig.[fe ]",
    "are shown the excitation potential  abundance diagram and the equivalent width  abundance diagram for lines of neutral ( dots ) and ionized ( crosses ) iron atoms . as follows from this figure ,",
    "there are no essential dependences for values considered .",
    "the large dispersion is mainly explained by errors of measurement of equivalent widths of weak absorption lines for such a faint object as the iras04296 ( see , for example , the similar dispersion on the fig.1 in the paper by decin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the brighter object iras22223 + 4327 , v=9.7 ) .",
    "we have checked the determination of iras04296 model parameters using weaker fei and feii lines and concluded that the parameters are steady within the erorr box up to @xmath41 = 100 - 150 m .",
    "this can also be seen from fig.[fe ] .",
    "it is well known that the plane - parallel static model atmosphere method does not give correct abundances for high luminosity stars ( luminosity classes ia ,",
    "the profiles of the spectral lines observed are broadened by non - thermal mechanisms whose influence may be variable at different levels in the atmosphere . therefore , to obtain more reliable estimates of chemical element abundances we use weak lines with @xmath42250 m .",
    "the average values of the equivalent widths @xmath43 we used for the abundances calculations are also given in table1 . only the baii abundance was calculated using 3 very strong lines : @xmath44 5853.67)=464 m , @xmath45 6141.71)=679 m and @xmath45 6496.90)=738 m , because the weaker lines of this element were not available . in general , the weak lines formed in deeper atmospheric layers are more correctly described by the standard static model . the limitation of equivalent width of lines used to @xmath46250 m significantly reduces the influence of uncertainty in the choice of @xmath47 .",
    "note , however , that the main factor in the abundance errors for most species remains the uncertainty of the @xmath15 value .",
    "therefore , we have checked our estimation of @xmath15 by modelling of spectral energy distribution for iras04296 .",
    "computed abundances of 26 chemical elements are presented in table1 . in the head of the table1 parameters of the adopted model atmosphere are shown .",
    "the dependence of chemical composition determination on uncertanties of the model atmosphere parameters is discussed in zas et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in the second column of table1",

    "it is important that we have not found any dependence of the abundances of these species on the equivalent width or on the excitation potential .",
    "therefore the microturbulent velocity does not vary between different chemical elements .",
    "values for most of the spectral lines used for the abundance calculations were taken from the list used by luck  ( 1991 ) .",

    "what is even more important , an excess of s ",
    "process elements was not found for a number of iras sources with altered cno - content but without the 21@xmath4 m feature ( some of which are oxygen - rich stars rather than carbon - rich stars ) : iras06338@xmath55333 ( luck & bond  1984 ; bond & luck  1987 ) , iras07331@xmath50021 ( luck & bond  1989 ; klochkova & panchuk  1996a ) , iras09276@xmath54454 ( klochkova & mishenina  1998 ) , iras12175@xmath1335338 ( van winckel  1997 ) , iras 12538@xmath1332611 ( luck et al .  1983 ; klochkova & panchuk  1988b ; giridhar et al .",
