    "a major focus of the research program at the jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) is to test the applicability of hadronic degrees of freedom in few - body nuclear systems through elastic electron scattering and photo - disintegration .",
    "earlier measurements have shown that a hadronic description works well down to scales of 1 fm at low energy transfers . however , deuteron photo - disintegration results show evidence of the scaling predicted by quark counting rules and a failure of the hadronic description at large energy and momentum transfers .",
    "the experiment described here aims at an additional test on the @xmath0he and @xmath1he nuclei .",
    "unpolarized @xmath4 scattering has been studied in hall a@xcite at jlab up to a @xmath2 value of 6 gev@xmath3 , providing accurate data on the deuteron structure function @xmath5 .",
    "tensor polarization in that same reaction was studied in hall c@xcite up to 1.7 gev@xmath3 , allowing a separate determination of all three deuteron form factors @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in that @xmath2-range .",
    "theoretical calculations using relativistic hadronic theory were able to describe all experimental data up to the highest @xmath2-value .",
    "on the other hand , the data for @xmath5 follow the scaling behavior predicted by pqcd for @xmath2-values larger than 4 gev@xmath3 .",
    "photo - disintegration of the deuteron has also been extensively studied at jlab , with publications of cross - section measurements@xcite from all three halls and a variety of polarization studies@xcite in hall a. hadronic theories can only describe the photo - disintegration cross - section data at low photon energies , while the data show the onset of approximate scaling for transverse momentum @xmath9 values larger than 1.3 gev/@xmath10 .",
    "the prediction of the quark - gluon string ( qgs ) model also agrees well with the data .",
    "the lowest - energy polarization - transfer data agree well with hadronic calculations . above 500 mev",
    "the magnitude of the induced polarization decreases rapidly to zero , in agreement with hadron helicity conservation ( hhc ) .",
    "the polarization transfer coefficients show maxima near 1 gev and appear to steadily decrease above that energy .",
    "this behavior is also consistent with hhc .    at larger energies",
    "there are significant differences between the kinematics of @xmath4 elastic scattering and deuteron photo - disintegration . in elastic scattering",
    "the invariant mass @xmath11 remains equal to the mass of the deuteron , whereas in photo - disintegration @xmath12 and resonances are explicitly excited . for a photon energy of 4 gev over 200 resonances can contribute through intermediate states , making detailed microscopic hadronic calculations unfeasible",
    "in the one - photon exchange approximation the cross section for elastic scattering off @xmath0he is given by :    @xmath13 ( \\frac{1}{1 + \\tau}),\\ ] ]    with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the mass and magnetic moment of the target nucleus , @xmath16 , @xmath17 the mott cross section and @xmath18 $ ] the linear polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "cross - section measurements at one @xmath2 value , but different scattering angles , are needed for a separate determination of the charge and magnetic form factors . for the spinless @xmath1he nucleus",
    "the cross section has only a contribution from the charge form factor    @xmath19    the form factors of the few - body systems are determined by the nuclear charge and current operators , that are a combination of one- and many - body terms .",
    "the one - body operator can be expressed in a standard way in terms of single - nucleon convection and magnetization currents .",
    "the latter are obtained by calculating the nuclear ground state , for which a number of methods have been used , @xmath20 solving the faddeev equations , using correlated hyperspherical harmonics , and monte carlo methods , either variational or green s function .",
    "modern calculations then include relativistic boost corrections .",
    "the two - body current operator can be decomposed in `` model - dependent '' and `` model - independent '' components .",
    "the model - independent one is obtained from the two - nucleon potential , and is dominated by a pion - like current acting at long range , but also includes a short - range rho - like current .",
    "three - body currents have been estimated , albeit only at small @xmath2 values , to have only a small contribution .",
    "the model - dependent currents are purely transverse and can not be linked to the two - nucleon interaction .",
    "the most important contribution , associated with the @xmath21-isobar , has been shown to have a significant contribution at intermediate @xmath2 values of @xmath22 1 gev@xmath3 . in the case of the deuteron",
    "the calculations are significantly simplified since only isoscalar terms need be included .",
    "a recent calculation@xcite that also includes a contribution from the @xmath23 transition mechanism , describes the jlab data@xcite through the largest @xmath2 value of 6 gev@xmath3 .",
    "most modern calculations are reasonably successful in describing both the charge and magnetic form - factor data for @xmath0he and @xmath1he through the diffraction maximum but deviate significantly in the region where a second diffraction minimum is expected .",
    "experiment e04 - 018@xcite was carried out - with two interruptions to run other experiments - from november 2006 through july 2007 . an intense electron beam with a current of up to 100 @xmath15a and an energy between 0.7 and 4.4",
    "gev was incident on cryogenic helium and hydrogen ( for calibration measurements ) target systems .",
    "the helium target cells were 20 cm long and operated at 8 k and 13 atm .",
    "the maximum luminosity used in the experiment was @xmath24 nuclei / cm@xmath3/s , which allowed measurements of cross sections as small as @xmath26 cm@xmath3/sr at 1 coincident event per day .",
    "scattered electrons and recoiling nuclei were detected in coincidence in the two identical high - resolution spectrometers ( hrs ) .",
    "both hrss used two planes of scintillators for triggering and timing purposes and two sets of vertical drift chambers for track reconstruction .",
    "electrons were identified using a erenkov detector and an electromagnetic lead - glass calorimeter .",
    "electron - nucleus coincidences were identified by double - arm time - of - flight measurements .",
    "data have been obtained in a @xmath2 range of 1 to 2.6 gev@xmath3 for @xmath0he and of 0.4 to 3 gev@xmath3 for @xmath1he .",
    "the on - line results show a clear indication of a second minimum in the @xmath1he charge form factor .",
    "if this is corroborated by the full analysis , expected by the summer of 2008 , it would be strong evidence that the @xmath1he charge form factor is still dominated by hadronic degrees of freedom through @xmath27 2 gev@xmath3 .",
    "the author thanks the e04 - 018 collaboration and especially its spokespersons , a. camsonne , j. gomez , a.t .",
