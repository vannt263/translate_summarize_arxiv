    "the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in rubidium by cornell and wieman [ 1 ] and in sodium by ketterle s group [ 2 ] have signalled a new era in ultra cold atomic physics and have virtually opened the flood gates for matter wave manipulation . at ultra low temperatures , the behaviour of becs is governed by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation which is nothing but the inhomogeneous ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation of the following form [ 3 - 6 ] @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the interatomic interaction and @xmath2 represents the external trapping potential that traps the atoms at such low temperatures .",
    "eventhough the above ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional gp equation is in general nonintegrable , it has been shown to admit integrability in quasi one dimensions for both time independent [ 7,8 ] and time dependent [ 9,10 ] harmonic trapping potentials .",
    "the experimental observation of bright [ 11 - 13 ] and dark solitons [ 14,15 ] in such quasi one dimensional becs has not only reconfirmed the integrability of the associated dynamical systems , but also stimulated a lot of interest to get a deeper understanding of the nonlinear phenomena surrounding becs .",
    "+ @xmath3 it must be mentioned that the behaviour of single component becs is controlled by the external trapping potential and the binary interatomic interaction ( scattering length ) .",
    "in contrast to single component becs , the dynamics of multicomponent becs [ 16 - 19 ] which comprise of either mixtures of different hyperfine states of the same atomic species or even mixtures of different atomic species is much richer by virtue of both interspecies interaction and intraspecies interaction .",
    "multicomponent becs show several interesting and novel phenomena like soliton trains , multidomain walls , spin switching [ 20 ] , multi mode collective excitations etc .",
    ", which are not normally encountered in single component becs .",
    "the recent analytical investigations of multicomponent becs [ 21,22 ] involving temporal variation of both interspecies and intraspecies scattering lengths have shown how the concept of coherent storage and matter wave switching can be manifested in the collisional dynamics of bright solitons .",
    "@xmath3 it is worth pointing at this juncture that the above scalar and vector becs involve the condensation of atoms or particles with integral spin ( bosons ) at the ground state .",
    "since the temperature at which bosons condense is governed by the inverse of the mass , the low density of the weekly interacting atoms combined with their relatively large mass ensures that the critical temperature is extremely low of the order order @xmath4 . in this context , it was believed that the condensation of quasi particles like excitons and polaritons with their high densities and negligible masses might occur at temperatures of several orders of magnitude higher than for atoms , reachable by standard cryogenic techniques . in this connection ,",
    "the advent of exciton bec [ 23 ] and a polariton bec ( or ) polariton laser[24 ] have certainly contributed to a resurgence in this exotic state of matter and have heralded a new era in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "excitons and polaritons are endowed with the spatially varying masses which ensures that the inter quasi - particle interaction could be spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "recently , such quasi particle condensates were modelled [ 25 ] by the gross- pitaeveskii equation with a space dependent dispersion coefficient reperesenting the position dependent masses of quasi particles of the form @xmath5 in the above equation , the dispersion coefficient @xmath6 , the scattering length @xmath7 and the trap @xmath8 are related by the following equations @xmath9 and @xmath10    @xmath3it should be mentioned that eq.(2 ) has been mapped on to the well known nls equation and has been investigated earlier [ 26 - 31 ] . in this context",
    ", it would be interesting to investigate the dynamics of two component quasi particle condensates .",
    "the fact that the two component quasi particle condensates are endowed with both intraspecies interaction and interspecies interaction means that one could conceive of spatio temporal binary interaction in them .",
    "@xmath3motivated by the above consideration , we investigate the dynamics of two component quasi particle condensates with space and time modulated nonlinearities . in particular , we derive the lax pair of the associated gross - pitaeveskii equation and generate bright solitons .",
    "we also study the collisional dynamics of matter wave solitons in harmonic and optical lattice potentials .",
    "@xmath3considering a temporally and spatially inhomogeneous two component quasi particle bec , the behaviour of the condensates that are prepared in two hyperfine states of the same atom can be described by the two coupled gp equation of the following form    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the above equation , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions of time . the arbitrary functions @xmath17and @xmath18 describe the temporal variation of binary interaction while the arbitrary functions ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath20 ) facilitate us to choose the potential and atomic feeding respectively . in the above equation ,",
    "the condensate wave functions are normalized to particle numbers @xmath21 while @xmath6 which represents the spatially varying dispersion coefficient is also related to the mass of the quasi - particles .",
    "equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) admit the following lax - pair @xmath22    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xmath27 in the above equation , @xmath28 represents the complex nonisospectral parameter and @xmath29 is a complex function of time while @xmath30 is the so called `` hidden complex spectral parameter '' .",
    "the temporal scattering lengths have been absorbed into @xmath31 and @xmath32 by substituting @xmath33 and @xmath34 . under the following transformation @xmath35 where @xmath36 eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) transform to the standard 2-component nls equation [ 32 ] .",
    "to generate the bright vector solitons of the coupled gp equations @xmath37 and @xmath38 , we now consider the vacuum solution ( @xmath39 ) so that the corresponding eigenvalue problem becomes @xmath40 where @xmath41 @xmath42 solving the above eigenvalue problem , one obtains the following vacuum eigen function @xmath43 where @xmath44 we now gauge transform the vacuum eigenfunction @xmath45 by a transformation function @xmath46 to give @xmath47 we now choose the transformation function @xmath46 from the solution of the associated riemann problem such that it is meromorphic in the complex @xmath48 plane as @xmath49\\cdot\\left(% \\begin{array}{ccc }    1 & 0 & 0 \\\\    0 & -1 & 0 \\\\    0 & 0 & -1 \\\\",

    "thus , choosing @xmath67 and @xmath53 and using eq .",
    "( 26 ) , the matrix @xmath64 can be explicitly written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 with @xmath70 while @xmath71 and @xmath72 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "now , substituting eqns.(17 ) , ( 21 ) in eqn.(19 ) , we obtain @xmath73    and similarly for @xmath74 .",
    "thus , one can write down the one soliton solution as    @xmath75    @xmath76    thus , the explicit forms of bright soliton solution can be written as    @xmath77    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the arbitrary parameter .",
    "looking at the above solution for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we infer that the amplitude of the bright solitons representing the condensates can be spatially and temporally modulated .",
    "this means that one can desirably change the intensities of the matter wave solitons by choosing spatial and temporal inhomogeneities suitably . in otherwords , spatially and temporally modulated scattering lengths",
    "can lead to various interesting profiles of the condensates .",
    "choosing the dispersion coefficient @xmath82 x @xmath83 x @xmath84 , one obtains an optical lattice potential as shown in figure ( 1a ) ( for an appropriate choice of the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 . under this condition",
    ", we observe that the matter waves are confined in space periodically as shown in figs ( 1b ) and ( 1c ) and we call them as `` grating solitons''[34 ] .",
    "the width and amplitude of the grating solitons can be modulated by suitably changing the parameters associated with @xmath6 .",

    "again , the width and amplitude of the bright solitons can be altered by changing the parameters associated with @xmath6 .",
    "this underscores the fact that the energy associated with the modes @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be modulated desirably .      choosing the transient trap as shown in fig ( 3a ) ( after appropriately choosing @xmath6 and the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath99 suitably ) , the behaviour of the condensates in the transient trap is shown in figures ( 3b ) and ( 3c ) . from the figures 3(a - c )",
    ", one could observe the stabilization of the condensates in the confining trap while the life time of the expulsive domain is too short to notice the dynamics of the condensates .",
    "choosing the dispersion coefficient @xmath100 x @xmath101 x @xmath84 , we observe that the external trap @xmath102 becomes zero . under this condition",
    ", we observe that the amplitude of the solitons keeps growing as they evolve in space and time as shown in figs ( 4a , b)and this increase of amplitude of matter wave solitons occurs without any addition of external energy for a specific choice of spatially inhomogeneous interaction .",
    "@xmath3the gauge transformation approach can be easily extended to generate multisoliton solution [ 33 ] and the interaction of solitons can be analysed .",
    "choosing the spatially varying dispersion coefficient of the form @xmath103 , one observes switching of intensities of matter wave solitons as shown in the figs ( 5a , b ) .",
    "thus , it is obvious from the figs ( 5 a , b ) that the intensity redistribution occurs between the modes @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is obvious from the above that cases [ ( i)-(v ) ] discuss the effect of spatially inhomogeneous interaction alone on the condensates . to investigate the impact of spatiotemporal interaction on the condensates ,",
    "we now consider the evolution of the condensates in the transient trap shown in figure ( 3a ) corresponding to case ( iii ) . now , evolving the temporal scattering lengths of the form @xmath104,the density of the condensates which were stabilized in the confining domain in the absence of temporal interaction now abruptly increases as shown in the figs ( 6a , b ) .",
    "we now suitably tune the spatially inhomogeneous interaction which subsequently reduces the density of the condensates . hence , we observe that it should be possible to vary the spatially inhomogeneous interaction to stabilize the condensates just as one temporally varies the scattering length using feshbach resonance as displayed in figs ( 7a , b ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that this is the first instance of the occurrence of feshbach resonance employing the variation of spatially inhomogeneous interaction .",
    "the combined effect of spatiotemporal interaction is that one can not only control the density of the condensates , but also design condensates with desirable density , shape ( or geometry ) and property leading to an era of * `` designer quasi particle condensates''*.",
    "in this paper , we have derived a new integrable model to investigate the dynamics of two component quasi - particle condensates with spatiotemporal interaction strengths and construct the associated lax pair .",
    "we then generate the matter wave solitons and study their properties in harmonic and optical lattice potentials .",
    "we also report the occurrence of feshbach resonance by subtle variation of spatially inhomogeneous interaction .",
    "we reiterate that the simultaneous impact of spatio temporal interaction could possibly herald a new era of \" * designer quasi particle condensates \" . *",
