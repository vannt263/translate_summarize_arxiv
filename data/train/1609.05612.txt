    "the chemical elements in the upper half of the periodic table represent only a tiny fraction of matter building up our universe .",
    "the reason for the rarity of these heavy elements is that they are produced in stars in subsidiary processes , not in the ones powering the star .",
    "it has been shown that these processes involve neutron - induced reactions that build the heavy elements from the iron group up to uranium .",
    "two distinct processes , characterized by neutron density and duration , have been identified : the slow and the rapid neutron - capture process , also called @xmath8- and @xmath9 process , respectively @xcite .    some of the most neutron deficient isotopes of the heavy elements , moreover , are even less abundant than the more neutron - rich ones .",
    "these stable isotopes on the proton rich side of the valley of stability between @xmath10se and @xmath11hg are the so - called @xmath4 isotopes .",
    "they are not produced in any of the neutron capture processes and their isotopic abundances are typically only 0.11% of that of their more neutron - rich neighbours .",
    "owing to their rareness and the fact that no heavy element has a dominant @xmath4 isotope , their existence is identified so far only in the solar system .",
    "we have no information on their abundance in other stars .",
    "regardless of their rarity , the existence of @xmath4 isotopes requires an explanation of their production processes and sites . to date",
    ", there is no unique and generally accepted process which could explain the abundances of _ all _ @xmath4 nuclei .",
    "several possible astrophysical production sites are suggested and also contributions from several mechanisms are considered . for reviews , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "perhaps the most important process which contributes to the synthesis of @xmath4 isotopes is the so - called @xmath0 process which converts heavy , neutron - rich species into @xmath4 isotopes through photodisintegration reactions @xcite . in the reaction network of a @xmath0-process model the ( @xmath0,n )  reactions , which drive the material toward the proton rich side , play the key role . on the proton rich side , ( @xmath0,p )  and ( @xmath0,@xmath2 )",
    "reactions start to compete with the ( @xmath0,n )  reactions and influence the resulting abundances of @xmath4 isotopes or their @xmath12-decay progenitors .",
    "although recent years have seen significant progress in modeling the @xmath0 process in massive stars @xcite , no good reproduction of abundances across the measured range has been achieved by the models , yet .",
    "especially severe differences can be found between calculated and observed abundances in certain mass regions , like around the mo - ru isotopes or at mass numbers around 150 .",
    "the failure of the models can in part be attributed to the nuclear physics input , especially in the region @xmath13 . for the light @xmath4 nuclides , thermonuclear supernovae with enhanced @xmath8-process seeds in binary systems",
    "have been suggested as a promising alternative @xcite .",
    "lacking experimental data in the relevant mass and energy range , the rates of reactions are taken from theoretical calculations based on the hauser - feshbach statistical model .",
    "an experimental check of the theoretical cross sections is therefore important to examine one possible reason of the deficiencies .",
    "this need triggered huge experimental work in the last decade on studying reactions relevant for the @xmath0 process ( see the references in the review paper @xcite and some of the most recent studies @xcite ) .",
    "owing to the size of a @xmath0-process network which involves thousands of reactions , it is difficult to identify a key reaction which should be the target of experimental investigations . sensitivity studies , however , have been carried out to point out those reactions to which @xmath0-process models are especially sensitive , i.e. , the @xmath0-process flow and therefore the resulting abundance of certain @xmath4 isotopes depend strongly on the rate of these reactions . the two , currently available sensitivity studies @xcite come up with lists of key reactions largely different from each other .",
    "this is due to the different approaches adopted .",
    "while the study by @xcite collectively varied groups of reactions to find their impact on final @xmath4 abundances , the paper by @xcite identified nuclides where predicted ( @xmath0,n ) ( @xmath0,p ) and/or ( @xmath0,@xmath2 )  rates are close and thus a change in either rate would affect deflections of the @xmath0-process path .",
    "there are only few reactions which are identified as being important in both studies , the @xmath1ba(@xmath0,@xmath2)@xmath3xe reaction being among them .",
    "earlier experiments have shown that in the case of ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )  reactions the discrepancy between experimental and calculated cross sections ( used to obtain reaction rates ) can easily be as much as a factor of three , or even an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the experimental study of the identified key reaction is of high importance .    instead of directly studying photodisintegration reactions , a cross section measurement of the reverse reaction , i.e. , particle capture , is usually preferred .",
    "technically , it is much easier to measure a charged particle capture cross section than a @xmath0 induced one .",
    "moreover , the effect of the thermally populated excited states of nuclei in the hot stellar plasma is much more pronounced in the case of @xmath0-induced reactions than for captures @xcite .",
    "thus , a measurement in the direction of the capture reaction provides more relevant astrophysical information compared to the study of the @xmath0-induced reaction itself .",
    "the aim of the present work is therefore the measurement of the @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  cross section .",
    "nevertheless , reactions on nuclei in excited states are particularly important at the high plasma temperatures encountered in the @xmath0 process also for captures .",
    "therefore , a measurement of laboratory ground - state ( g.s . ) cross sections can not fully constrain the stellar reaction rate but a comparison to the calculated g.s .",
    "cross sections allows to perform an important test of the prediction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : invesreac ] provides some further details about the investigated reactions .",
    "the experimental technique is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] while conclusions and a summary are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "at typical @xmath0-process temperatures of about 1.5  3.5 gk , the relevant energy range of the @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  reaction lies between 4.4mev and 10.6mev @xcite . due to the high coulomb barrier",
    ", the @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  cross section is very small in this energy range , dropping from about 10 @xmath14barn down to 10@xmath15 barn with decreasing energy .",
    "therefore , it was only possible to measure the cross section slightly above this energy range , between 10.6 and 13.6 mev in center - of - mass energy",
    ".    besides radiative capture , several reaction channels are open in the @xmath3xe + @xmath2 system in this energy range . however , as most of these channels involve the emission of low - energy charged particles , and are therefore suppressed by the coulomb barrier , only the ( @xmath16 ) , ( @xmath2,n ) , and ( @xmath2,p ) channels have non - negligible cross sections .",
    "these three channels lead to radioactive residual nuclei , @xmath1ba , @xmath5ba and @xmath5cs , respectively , and thus their cross sections can in principle be measured using the activation method .",
    "the activation method proved to be an extremely powerful technique for cross section measurements relevant for the @xmath0 process . above the fe region ,",
    "most of the charged - particle induced reaction cross sections have been measured with this method @xcite .",
    "also in the present work , the @xmath2-induced cross sections of @xmath3xe were measured with the activation method .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     the uncertainty of the cross section is calculated by taking into account the following partial errors : number of projectiles ( 3% , from the precision of the charge measurement ) , number of target atoms ( 2% , from the uncertainty of pressure and temperature measurement ) , the change of the physical dimensions of the gas cell ( 0.4% , from the deformation measurements ) , @xmath0-detection efficiency ( 7 - 11% ) , counting statistics ( @xmath17% for the ( @xmath2,@xmath0 ) and @xmath18% for the ( @xmath19 ) reaction ) and the ( @xmath2,@xmath4 ) reaction s contribution ( @xmath20% ) ) .",
    "the lowest energy irradiation ( e@xmath21=10.1mev ) was below the ( @xmath2,n )  reaction threshold ( 10.83mev ) , taking into account the energy loss in the entrance foil . in the case of the next three energies",
    "( e@xmath6=11.5 , 12 and 12.5mev ) the yield of the ( @xmath2,n )  reaction channel was too low .",
    "therefore , the @xmath3xe(@xmath2,n)@xmath5ba  cross section was determined only above these energies while the @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  cross section was successfully measured in the whole studied energy range .",
    "figures[fig : agres ] and [ fig : anres ] show the measured cross section of the @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  and @xmath3xe(@xmath2,n)@xmath5ba  reactions , respectively , as astrophysical @xmath22 factor @xcite .",
    "the results of statistical model calculations for the cross sections obtained with the default settings of the hauser - feshbach codes non - smoker @xcite , talys @xcite , and smaragd ( version 0.9.3s ) @xcite are also included in the figures .",
    "apart from differences in the internal numerics , the codes mainly differ in the input used to determine the transmission coefficients which are the central quantities in the hauser - fesbach approach @xcite .",
    "of special relevance here is the optical @xmath2+nucleus potential , as discussed in more detail below .",
    "currently , the rates of @xcite are used in most astrophysical studies .    as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : agres ] and [ fig : anres ] , the shown non - smoker and smaragd cross sections reproduce the measured energy dependence well but are larger by about a factor of 5 in both reactions .",
    "the talys calculation using the standard input parameters of the code version 1.6 gives similar ( @xmath2,n ) cross sections as non - smoker and smaragd .",
    "the unusual energy dependence of the talys ( @xmath2,@xmath0 ) cross section , on the other hand , is not reproduced by the measured data .      in this section",
    "we want to provide a more detailed analysis aimed at understanding the discrepancy between theory and experiment , and its impact on the stellar rates .",
    "to understand the source of the differences , and whether it is important for the astrophysical rate , it is necessary to consider the sensitivity of the calculated cross sections on the various nuclear properties entering the reaction model .",
    "central to the hauser - feshbach model are the averaged widths , computed from transmission coefficients which , in turn , are obtained from solutions of the schrdinger equation using effective interaction potentials or , for photon transmission coefficients , from the knowledge of photon strength functions and nuclear level densities @xcite . for reactions in astrophysics , mostly averaged neutron- , proton- , @xmath2- , and @xmath0 widths have to be considered . for the reactions considered here ,",
    "the impact of the proton width is negligible .",
    "figures [ fig : sensiag ] and [ fig : sensian ] show the sensitivities of the ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )  and ( @xmath2,n )  cross sections , respectively , to variations of the remaining widths .",
    "the sensitivity is defined as in @xcite and can vary between 0 ( no sensitivity ) and 1 ( full sensitivity ) , i.e. , the cross section @xmath23 will be changed by a factor @xmath24 , where @xmath8 is the sensitivity and @xmath25 the factor with which the width was varied . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the varied cross section is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the sensitivities shown here differ from those given in @xcite because it turned out that the excited states given in @xcite , which were used for the calculations in @xcite , do not define a complete set of states in @xmath5ba . due to the endothermic nature of @xmath3xe(@xmath2,n)@xmath5ba this",
    "strongly affects the resulting cross sections in the measured energy range .",
    "( similar problems due to incomplete sets of experimentally determined excited states were also discussed in @xcite . ) in the present work , the incomplete set of excited states was neglected in the smaragd calculations and instead the nuclear level density of @xcite with the parity distribution of @xcite was used above the ground state .    as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : sensiag ] and [ fig : sensian ] , the cross sections of both reactions are equally sensitive to the @xmath2 width across the measured energy range . on the other hand , the sensitivities to variations of the neutron- and @xmath0 widths are energy dependent and width variations also act oppositely in the two reactions .",
    "it should be noted that the three different calculations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : agres ] and [ fig : anres ] use different descriptions of nuclear properties .",
    "since the smaragd cross sections are above the experimentally determined ones in both reactions , a consistent rescaling can only be achieved by altering the @xmath2 width . even more constraining is the fact that it was possible to obtain ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )  data below the ( @xmath2,n )  threshold , where the neutron width does not contribute and the @xmath0 width is larger than the @xmath2 width , leading to a dependency of the cross section solely on the @xmath2 width . using the standard @xmath2+nucleus optical potential by @xcite , which was also used in the non - smoker rates @xcite , the smaragd cross sections shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensiag ] were obtained , requiring a renormalization of the calculated @xmath2 width by a factor of 0.125 to be in agreement with the experimental data point at the lowest energy.combining this with the ( @xmath2,n )  data at the upper end of the investigated energy range , which again almost exclusively depends on the @xmath2 width , allows to check whether the required scaling would be energy dependent . at the data point with highest energy ,",
    "the @xmath2 width had to be divided by three to reproduce the experimental cross section .",
    "it has to be cautioned , however , that the cross sections at this energy still are weakly dependent on the neutron- and @xmath0 widths .",
    "such a strong energy dependence has not been observed yet in other ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )  reactions studied in connection with the @xmath0 process .",
    "it can not , for example , be reproduced by the energy - dependent optical potential introduced in @xcite and subsequently used successfully to describe further reactions ( see the experimental references given in sec .  [",
    "sec : intro ] ) .    further experimental data below the ( @xmath2,n )  threshold would be needed to constrain fully the energy dependence and to determine the @xmath2 widths at astrophysically relevant energies due to the appearance of @xmath2 transitions to excited states in _ stellar _ rates . for the reaction in question",
    ", the relevant energy window lies below the measured energy range . even without this additional information",
    ", however , it is possible to discuss the astrophysical impact of a reduced @xmath2 width . required for astrophysical reaction network calculations",
    "are the _ stellar _ rates ( including reactions on thermally excited nuclei ) for @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  and its reverse reaction which can be derived applying detailed balance @xcite . both rates , for forward and reverse reaction , scale by the same factors and thus scaling the stellar ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )  rate will scale the stellar ( @xmath0,@xmath2 )  rate similarily .",
    "( note that this only applies to _ stellar _ rates including the effect of thermally excited nuclei , but not to g.s .",
    "rates and cross sections . ) in the @xmath0 process relevant for the production of @xmath4 nuclei , the ( @xmath0,@xmath2 )  reaction will dominate over the capture reaction , as there are no free @xmath2 particles to be captured . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : branching ] and discussed in @xcite , the stellar rate for @xmath1ba(@xmath0,@xmath2)@xmath3xe is close to the @xmath1ba(@xmath0,n ) and @xmath1ba(@xmath0,p ) rates and thus may provide a deflection in the path of ( @xmath0,n )  photodisintegrations .",
    "an increase in the rate would not only increase the @xmath3xe production through this path but also increase the sensitivity of the final abundance to this reaction .",
    "this is why a stronger dependence on this rate was found in @xcite when increasing it strongly .",
    "our experimental data , however , rule out an increase and rather suggest a considerable suppression of this reaction path .",
    "a rate reduction by a factor of 0.125 , as found with the lowest data point , already renders the ( @xmath0,@xmath2 )  rate unimportant compared to ( @xmath0,n )  in the relevant temperature range . a further reduction , although to be expected from the energy dependence extracted from the experimental data , will not change this conclusion and will have no further impact on the final abundance of @xmath4 nuclei .",
    "this is also the reason why ref .",
    "@xcite found only a modest impact of the rate even when reducing it by a factor of 0.1 .    to confirm this ,",
    "we have performed full @xmath0-process network calculations with different @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  rates , using two approaches to simulate nucleosynthesis in the explosion of a 25 @xmath7 star .",
    "the default non - smoker rate ( standard rate ) was taken from @xcite , as it was also used in @xcite and in rate set a of @xcite . as a second trial rate",
    ", we use the rate obtained with the smaragd code when using the potential by @xcite but renormalizing the obtained @xmath2 width by a factor of 0.125 as suggested by the experimental data .",
    "a third and fourth rate were obtained by using factors of 0.05 and 0.01 , respectively . in terms of astrophysical models ,",
    "the mass zones and trajectories from the stellar model of @xcite were employed ( model a ) .",
    "the same model was applied in @xcite .",
    "recently it was pointed out , however , that the zoning grid in this model is too coarse to follow the production of @xmath4 nuclei in detail @xcite .",
    "therefore we studied the @xmath0 process also in a second model with a finer grid of mass shells ( model b ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3xe abundance changes for the eight calculations ( four rates each in two models ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stellarmodels ] .",
    "both stellar models show the same dependence of the final @xmath3xe abundance on the @xmath2 width . as expected from the inspection of the rate ratios , the production decreases when using the modified rates .",
    "the reduction is very moderate , however , and much smaller than the ratios of the rates with respect to the standard rate .",
    "this is in line with what was found in fig .",
    "[ fig : branching ] . any further reduction also would not alter the production factor anymore because the ( @xmath0,@xmath2 )  rate is already smaller than the ( @xmath0,n )  one and thus its absolute value is not significant anymore .",
    "the reaction cross sections of @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba  and @xmath3xe(@xmath2,n)@xmath5ba  were measured close to the ( @xmath2,n )  threshold using the activation method .",
    "it was found that the experimental cross sections for both reactions are smaller than the ones predicted by the reaction model which has been used in previous @xmath0-process studies .",
    "this is in line with the findings of previous ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )  and ( @xmath2,n )  experiments on other @xmath4 nuclei , which also showed smaller cross sections than predicted ( see @xcite and references in @xcite ) .    although the covered energy range is slightly above the astrophysically relevant energies , it is possible to evaluate the astrophysical impact of the measurement .",
    "the ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )  cross section below the threshold can be taken as an upper limit for the calculation of the astrophysically relevant @xmath1ba(@xmath0,@xmath2 )  reaction rate . since the new rate is already below the @xmath1ba(@xmath0,n )",
    "rate , it was possible to show that this reaction path can not contribute significantly to the synthesis of the @xmath4 nucleus @xmath3xe .    a further reduction of the @xmath1ba(@xmath0,@xmath2 )  rate does not change this conclusion .",
    "it can be affected , however , by modified @xmath1ba(@xmath0,n )  and @xmath1ba(@xmath0,p )  rates .",
    "the values of these rates used in current astrophysical simulations are still based on theoretical predictions by @xcite .",
    "an experimental investigation of the respective ( n,@xmath0 )  and ( p,@xmath0 )  cross sections close to the astrophysically relevant energy window would be desirable . unfortunately , this proves to be very difficult because both @xmath5ba and @xmath5cs are unstable and any measurements will have to await further technical development .",

    "<S> background : :    the synthesis of heavy , proton rich isotopes in the astrophysical    @xmath0 process proceeds through photodisintegration    reactions . for the improved understanding of the process , the rates of    the involved nuclear reactions must be known . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction    @xmath1ba(@xmath0,@xmath2)@xmath3xe    was found to affect the abundance of the @xmath4 nucleus    @xmath3xe in previous rate variation studies . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    since the stellar rate for this reaction can not be determined by a    measurement directly , the aim of the present work was to measure the    cross section of the inverse    @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba    reaction and to compare the results with statistical model predictions    used in astrophysical networks . modified nuclear input can then be    used to provide an improved stellar reaction rate . of great importance    </S>",
    "<S> is the fact that data below the ( @xmath2,n )  threshold was    obtained . </S>",
    "<S> studying simultaneously the    @xmath3xe(@xmath2,n)@xmath5ba    reaction channel at higher energy allowed to further identify the    source of a discrepancy between data and prediction . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    the    @xmath3xe(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath1ba    and    @xmath3xe(@xmath2,n)@xmath5ba    cross sections were measured with the activation method using a thin    window @xmath3xe gas cell and an @xmath2    beam from a cyclotron accelerator . the studied energy range was    between e@xmath6=11 and 15 mev close above the    astrophysically relevant energy range . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the obtained cross sections are compared with hauser - feshbach    statistical model calculations . the experimental cross sections are    smaller than standard predictions previously used in astrophysical    calculations . as dominating source of the difference , the theoretical    @xmath2 width was identified . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data    suggest an @xmath2 width lower by at least a factor of    0.125 in the astrophysically important energy range . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    an upper limit for the    @xmath1ba(@xmath0,@xmath2)@xmath3xe    stellar rate was inferred from our measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of this    rate and lower rates was studied in two different models for    core - collapse supernova explosions of 25 @xmath7 stars .    </S>",
    "<S> a significant contribution to the @xmath3xe abundance via    this reaction path would only be possible when the rate was increased    above the previous standard value . </S>",
    "<S> since the experimental data rule    this out , they also demonstrate the closure of this production path . </S>"
