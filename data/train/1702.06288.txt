    "the aim of these notes is to present some recent and forthcoming works , in particular @xcite and @xcite , obtained by the author in collaboration with olivier glass , christophe lacave and alexandre munnier establishing point vortex dynamics as zero - radius limits of motions of a rigid body immersed in a two dimensional incompressible perfect fluids in several inertia regimes .",
    "the rigid body is assumed to be only accelerated by the force exerted by the fluid pressure on its boundary according to the newton equations , the fluid velocity and pressure being given by the incompressible euler equations .",
    "the equations at stake then read : @xmath0    here    * @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively denote the velocity and pressure fields ( the fluid is supposed to be homogeneous , of density @xmath3 in order to simplify the notations ) , * @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote respectively the mass and the momentum of inertia of the body , * @xmath6 is the velocity of the center of mass @xmath7 of the body and @xmath8 is the angular velocity .",
    "the body rigidly moves so that at times @xmath9 it occupies a domain @xmath10 which is isometric to its initial position @xmath11 which is supposed to be a simply connected smooth compact subset of @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , there exists a rotation matrix @xmath13 such that @xmath14 furthermore , the angle satisfies @xmath15 * when @xmath16 the notation @xmath17 stands for @xmath18 , * @xmath19 denotes the unit normal vector pointing outside the fluid domain , which of course depends on the solid position .",
    "we assume that the boundary of the solid is impermeable so that the fluid can not penetrate into the solid and we assume that there is no cavitation as well .",
    "the natural boundary condition at the fluid - solid interface is therefore @xmath20 let us emphasize that this condition extends the usual condition @xmath21 on a fixed boundary and involves only the normal part of the fluid velocity .",
    "as usual with perfect fluid no pointwise boundary condition needs to be prescribed for the tangential part of the fluid velocity . however because the domain occupied by the solid is a hole in the fluid domain there is a global condition on the tangential part of the fluid velocity involving the circulation @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fluid velocity and @xmath25 the the unit counterclockwise tangential vector so that @xmath26 .",
    "indeed when considering a fluid velocity @xmath24 which has a good enough regularity , what we will always do in these notes , the so - called kelvin s theorem applies and @xmath27 is preserved over time .",
    "the circulation somehow encodes the amount of vorticity hidden in the particle from the fluid viewpoint .",
    "indeed by green theorem the circulation can be recast as the integral over @xmath11 of the vorticity @xmath28 of any smooth vector field @xmath29 in @xmath11 such that @xmath30 on @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the limit where the body radius converges to zero corresponds to a singular perturbation problem ( in space ) for the fluid velocity when this latter has to accommodate with a condition of nonzero @xmath22 around a shrinking solid .",
    "indeed it is well understood since the works @xcite and @xcite that for a solid obstacle held fixed in a perfect incompressible fluid , with a nonzero given circulation and with possibly nonzero vorticity in the fluid , in the limit where the obstacle shrinks into a fixed pointwise particle , the euler equation driving the fluid evolution has to be modified : in the biot - savart law providing the fluid velocity generated by the fluid vorticity , a dirac mass at the fixed position of the pointwise obstacle with an amplitude equal to the circulation has to be added to the fluid vorticity .",
    "we will refer to the background fluid velocity in the sequel and we will denote it by @xmath32 .",
    "the genuine fluid vorticity @xmath33 ( that is without the dirac mass ) is convected by the background fluid velocity @xmath34 . in the case of a moving body",
    "one may wonder if the divergence of the fluid velocity has to be modified in the zero - radius limit as well in order to accommodate with the non - homogeneous condition . in the sequel we will consider some cases where the solid radius @xmath35 shrinks to @xmath36 with @xmath37 bounded so that the limit fluid velocity is divergence free including in the region where the solid has disappeared . ]",
    "see below , should the behaviour of the solid velocity with @xmath35 be worse the resulting singularity would be rather a dipole than a dirac mass . ] still the analysis of the dynamics of immersed rigid particles requires a more precise analysis , in particular because it is driven by the fluid pressure , a quantity which depends in a non linear and non local way on the fluid velocity . hence to understand the limit dynamics one has to precisely evaluate the pressure field on the boundary of the solid , that is , where the singularity is concentrated .",
    "one main goal of this line of research is prove another derivation of the point vortex dynamics as motions of immersed particles .",
    "in particular we will consider , in some appropriate settings , the limit of the dynamics of an immersed rigid body when its size and its mass go to zero and recover the equation of a point vortex .",
    "let us recall that the point vortex system is a classical model which goes back to helmholtz @xcite , kirchhoff @xcite , poincar @xcite , routh @xcite , kelvin @xcite , and lin @xcite .",
    "in these works it was thought as an idealized fluid model where the vorticity of an ideal incompressible two - dimensional fluid is discrete .",
    "although it does not constitute a solution of the incompressible euler equations , even in the sense of distributions , point vortices can be viewed as dirac masses obtained as limits of concentrated smooth vortices which evolve according to the euler equations . in particular in the case of a single vortex moving in a bounded and simply - connected domain",
    "this was proved by turkington in @xcite and an extension to the case of several vortices , including in the case where there is also a part of the vorticity which is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure ( the so - called wave - vortex system ) , was given by marchioro and pulvirenti , see @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that gallay has recently proven in @xcite that the point vortex system can also be obtained as vanishing viscosity limits of concentrated smooth vortices evolving according to the incompressible navier - stokes equations .",
    "our main goal is to prove that this classical point vortex motion can also be viewed as the limit of the dynamics of a solid , shrinking into a pointwise massless particle with fixed circulation , in free motion .",
    "indeed , our analysis also covers the case where the mass is kept fixed positive in the limit , one then obtains a second - order ordinary differential equation for the particle s position , that we will refer to as a `` massive '' point vortex system .    let us precise more the two kinds of inertia regimes we are going to consider in the small radius limit with the following definitions .    [ massivep ] we define    * a massive particle as the limit of a rigid body when its radius @xmath35 goes to @xmath36 with its mass @xmath38 and its momentum of inertia @xmath39 respectively satisfying @xmath40 and @xmath41 * a massless particle as the limit of a rigid body when its radius @xmath35 goes to @xmath36 with its mass @xmath38 and its momentum of inertia @xmath39 respectively satisfying @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are fixed independent of @xmath35 .",
    "five remarks are in order :    * it is understood that we consider a self - similar shrinking of the rigid body into its center of mass .",
    "choosing the origin @xmath36 of the frame as the center of mass of @xmath47 it means that we will as initial domain , for every @xmath48 $ ] , @xmath49 * one observes , of course , that the case of a massive particle corresponds to the limit case @xmath50 , * the scaling of momentum of inertia @xmath39 may look surprising at first sight , but it is quite natural since it corresponds to a second order moment whereas the mass is a zeroth order moment of the body s density , * it is understood that the circulation @xmath51 around the body satisfies @xmath52 , where @xmath22 is fixed . the amount of circulation is therefore supposed to be independent of the size of the body in our problem .",
    "moreover we assume that @xmath53 in the case of a massless particle . *",
    "the case where @xmath47 is a homogeneous disk is the most simple whereas the case where @xmath47 is a non - homogeneous disk involves some adapted tools in particular in order to deal with the case where @xmath54 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed treatment of these cases and we will consider only here the case where @xmath47 is not a disk .",
    "let us have a deeper look at newton s equations and anticipate that in the case of a massless particle the prefactor @xmath55 and @xmath56 in front of the second - order time derivative converge to zero in the zero radius limit so that one faces a singular perturbation problem in time of a non linear dynamics .",
    "we will make use of geodesic and gyroscopic features of the system in order to overcome this difficulty .",
    "let us mention from now on that the use of the geodesic structure is more subtle that one may expect at first glance .",
    "indeed the full system `` fluid + rigid body '' is conservative and enjoy a geodesic structure as a whole in the sense that if on a time interval @xmath57 the initial and final configurations are prescribed , then the pde s system `` fluid + rigid body '' is satisfied on @xmath57 if and only if the couple of flow maps associated with the fluid and solid velocities is a critical point of the action obtained by time integration of the total kinetic energy , cf @xcite .",
    "this gives some credit to the belief that the energy conservation drives the dynamics of the system , still some important transfers of energy from one phase to another may occur and this lead to a lack of bound of the solid velocity in the case of a light body . since the fluid velocity corresponding to a point vortex is not square integrable",
    "a renormalization of the energy is necessary in the zero radius limit .",
    "indeed one main feature of the point vortex equation is that the self - induced velocity of the vortex is discarded , or more precisely the self - induced velocity as if the point vortex was alone in the plane .",
    "let us therefore introduce @xmath58 $ ] the biot - savart law in the full plane that is the operator which maps any reasonable scalar function @xmath33 to the unique vector field @xmath59 $ ] vanishing at infinity and satisfying @xmath60   = 0 $ ] and @xmath61 = \\omega$ ] in @xmath62 , which is given by the convolution formula @xmath63:=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi } \\int _ { \\mathbb{r}^{2 } } \\frac{(x - y)^{\\perp}}{|x - y|^{2 } } \\omega ( t , y ) \\ , dy .\\ ] ] we believe that the following statement is true in a very general setting .     a massive particle immersed in a two dimensional incompressible perfect fluid moves according to newton s law with a gyroscopic force orthogonally proportional to its relative velocity and proportional to the circulation around the body .",
    "a massless particle immersed in a two dimensional incompressible perfect fluid with nonzero circulation moves as a point vortex , its vortex strength being given by the circulation . more precisely , the position @xmath64 of a massive ( respectively massless ) particle satisfies the equation @xmath65 with can be either interpreted as drift or desingularized as it is obtained from @xmath34 by removing its orthoradial singular part in @xmath66 . ]",
    "@xmath67 \\big ) ( h ) $ ] where @xmath34 denotes the background fluid velocity hinted above . on the other hand the genuine fluid vorticity @xmath33",
    "is convected by the background fluid velocity @xmath34 .",
    "let us mention that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) friedrichs already evoked a similar conjecture with a massive point vortex system in the case of two point vortices in the whole plane under the terminology of _ bound vortices _",
    "( as opposed to _ free vortices _ ) .",
    "the gyroscopic force appearing in the right hand side of the first equation in is a generalisation of the kutta - joukowski lift force which attracted a huge interest at the beginning of the 20th century during the first mathematical investigations in aeronautics , and which will be recalled in section [ chap1 ] .",
    "observe that the conjecture above does not mention any sensitivity to the body s shape .",
    "indeed it is expected that a more accurate description of the asymptotic behaviour thanks to a multi - scale asymptotic expansion of the body s dynamics in the limit @xmath68 will reveal an influence of the body s shape on some corrector terms which appears as subprincal in the limit @xmath68 for coarse topologies .",
    "the case where the circulation is assumed to vanish with @xmath35 as @xmath68 is another setting where such a dependence with respect to the body s shape should appear .",
    "indeed this conjecture has already been proved in a few cases and this is precisely the goal of these notes to give an account of these results .    * * in section [ chap1 ] , * we will start with a review of the case , well - known since more than one century , of the motion of one single rigid body immersed in an irrotational fluid filling the rest of the plane . in this setting the equations at stake are the incompressible euler equations on the fluid domain @xmath69 , the newton equations , the interface condition and the following condition of decay at infinity : @xmath70 . regarding the initial conditions we observe that there is no loss of generality in assuming that the center of mass ( respectively rotation angle ) of the solid coincides at the initial time with the origin @xmath71 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) and we therefore prescribe some initial position and velocity of the solid of the form @xmath72 . on the other hand",
    "we prescribe the initial value of the velocity @xmath73 in the initial domain @xmath74 occupied by the fluid .",
    "of course since we aim at considering smooth solutions we assume that the fluid and solid initial data are compatible .",
    "we may therefore consider that the solid translation and rotation velocities @xmath75 and @xmath76 are arbitrarily given and that the fluid velocity @xmath77 is the unique vector field compatible in the sense of the following definition .",
    "+ [ compdata ] given the initial domain @xmath78 occupied by the body , @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively in @xmath62 and @xmath79 , and @xmath27 in @xmath80 , we say that a vector field @xmath81 on the closure of @xmath82 with values in @xmath62 is compatible if it is the unique vector field satisfying the following div / curl type system : @xmath83 + indeed the zero vorticity condition propagates from @xmath84 according to helmholtz s third theorem so that at any time @xmath85 the fluid velocity @xmath86 can indeed be recovered from the solid s dynamics by an elliptic - type problem similar to the one given above for the initial data .",
    "since time appears only as a parameter rather than in the differential operators , the fluid state may be seen as only solving an auxiliary steady problem rather than an evolution equation .",
    "the newton equations can therefore be rephrased as a second - order differential equation whose coefficients are determined by the auxiliary fluid problem .",
    "in particular the prefactor of the translation and angular accelerations is the sum of the inertia of the solid and of the so - called `` added inertia '' which is a symmetric positive - semidefinite matrix depending only on the body s shape and which encodes the amount of incompressible fluid that the rigid body has also to accelerate around itself . remarkably enough in the case where the circulation is @xmath36",
    "it turns out that the solid equations can be recast as a geodesic equation associated with the metric given by the total inertia .",
    "unlike the geodesic structure of the full system `` fluid + rigid body '' hinted above , the configuration manifold only encodes here the solid s dynamics and is therefore of finite dimensions .",
    "this echoes that the equations of motion of point vortices embedded in incompressible flow are usually thought as a reduction of an infinite - dimensional dynamical system , namely the incompressible euler equation , to a finite - dimensional system .",
    "another celebrated feature of the body s dynamics is due to a gyroscopic force , proportional to the circulation around the body , known as the kutta - joukowski lift force . in order to make these features appear ,",
    "theorem [ pasdenom ] , and to make as explicit as possible the quantities genuinely involved in this ode two approaches were followed in the literature : the first one dates back to blasius , kutta , joukowski , chaplygin and sedov , cf .",
    "for instance @xcite , and relies on complex analysis whereas the second one is real - analytic and was initiated by lamb , cf .",
    "we will report here these two methods . which reports the results of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the presentation of the real - analytic method is extracted from the use we made of it in our investigation of the case where fluid - solid system occupies a bounded domain , cf .",
    "section [ chap2 ] which reports the results of @xcite .",
    "arguably the length comparison and the temporary occurrence of archimedes type quantities ( like the volume of the body , its geometric center .. ) in some intermediate computations leading to lemma [ propcia ] ( where they cancel out ) emphasize the superiority of lamb s method for our purposes .",
    "indeed in our forthcoming paper @xcite lamb s approach is extended to tackle the general case where several bodies move in a bounded rotational perfect flow when some of the rigid bodies shrink to pointwise particles , some of them with constant mass , the others with vanishing mass .",
    "still the complex - analytic method is known to be useful to deal with the case of a body whose boundary has singularities thanks to conformal mapping",
    ". it could be that it appears relevant as well to investigate the motion of a rigid curve resulting from an anisotropic shrinking . in this direction",
    "let us mention the paper @xcite which deals with the influence of a fixed curve on the fluid around . ]",
    "a trivial consequence of this reformulation is that a global - in - time smooth solution to the cauchy problem exists and is unique .",
    "therefore in section [ chap1 ] ( cf . below proposition [ cp ] ) we will prove the following classical result .",
    "+ [ thm - intro - sec1-cp ] given the initial domain @xmath11 occupied by the body , the initial solid translation and rotation velocities @xmath87 in @xmath88 , the circulation @xmath22 in @xmath79 , and @xmath81 the associated compatible initial fluid velocity ( according to definition [ compdata ] ) , there exists a unique smooth global - in - time solution to the problem compound of the incompressible euler equations on the fluid domain , of the newton equations , of the interface condition , of the condition at infinity : @xmath70 , and of the initial conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "+ moreover the structure of the reduced ode hinted above allows to investigate the zero - radius limit quite easily and to obtain the following result .",
    "+ [ thm - intro - sec1-vo ] let be given a rescaled initial domain @xmath11 occupied by the body , some initial solid translation and rotation velocities @xmath87 in @xmath89 and a circulation @xmath90 in @xmath91 in the case of a massive particle and in @xmath92 in the case of a massless particle , all of them independent of @xmath35 .",
    "let , for each @xmath93 , @xmath94 the associated compatible initial fluid velocity associated ( according to definition [ compdata ] ) with the initial solid domain @xmath95 defined by , @xmath87 and @xmath22 ; and consider the corresponding solution given by theorem [ thm - intro - sec1-cp ] . then in the zero radius limit @xmath68 , with the inertia scaling described in definition [ massivep ] , one respectively obtains for the position @xmath64 of the pointwise limit particle the equations @xmath96 in the massive limit and @xmath97 in the massless limit .",
    "+ therefore , in this historical setting , conjecture @xmath98 is validated with @xmath99 .",
    "of course theorem [ thm - intro - sec1-vo ] is a quite informal statement put here for sake of exposition , we will provide a rigorous statement in section [ chap1 ] , cf .",
    "theorem [ pasdenom - vo ] . * * in section [ chap2 ] , * we consider the case where the fluid - solid system occupies a bounded domain @xmath100 , still in the irrotational case .",
    "we assume that @xmath100 is a bounded open regular connected and simply connected domain @xmath100 of @xmath101 and that the center of mass of the solid coincides at the initial time with the origin @xmath102 which is assumed to be in @xmath103 + again the fluid velocity can be recovered from the solid s dynamics by an elliptic - type problem for which time is only a parameter and the newton equations can therefore be rephrased as a second - order differential equation with geodesic and gyroscopic features involving some coefficients determined by this auxiliary fluid problem .",
    "+ still some extra difficulties show up in this process .",
    "in particular the way the fluid domain depends on the body motion is more intricate and so are the variations of the added inertia and therefore of the metric given by the total inertia . indeed even in the case of zero circulation ( i.e. when @xmath104 ) the reformulation of the system as an geodesic equation was proven only recently in @xcite",
    ". the general case , with nonzero @xmath90 is obtained in @xcite .",
    "one another main new feature with respect to the unbounded case is that the kutta - joukowski lift force is superseded by a more sophisticated force term which has the form of the lorentz force in electromagnetism .",
    "indeed the magnetic part of the lorentz force , being gyroscopic and proportional to the circulation around the body , is a quite natural extension of the kutta - joukowski lift force of the unbounded case .",
    "still it depends on the body position in a more subtle way . on the other hand the electric - type force which may seem very damaging in order to obtain uniform estimates in the zero - radius limit as it does not disappear in an energy estimate .",
    "+ at least for fixed radius we will be able to infer straightforwardly from this reformulation the local - in - time existence and uniqueness of smooth solution to the cauchy problem . unlike the unbounded case of section [ chap1 ] , cf .",
    "theorem [ thm - intro - sec1-cp ] , the result is only local - in - time since collision of the body with the external may occur in finite time ( at least as far as it concerns smooth solutions ) , see @xcite for some examples of collisions of a disk moving in a potential flow ( that is in the case where the circulation @xmath27 satisfies @xmath105 ) with the fixed external boundary of the fluid domain .",
    "indeed an energy argument , cf .",
    "corollary [ bd - loin ] , proves that the life - time of such a smooth solution can only be limited by a collision . in order to obtain smooth solutions , even for small time",
    ", it is necessary to consider some compatible initial data .",
    "we therefore adapt the notion of compatible initial fluid velocity introduced in definition [ compdata ] to the bounded case .",
    "+ [ compdatabd ] given the open regular connected and simply connected bounded cavity @xmath106 and the initial regular closed domain @xmath107 occupied by the body , @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively in @xmath62 and @xmath79 , and @xmath27 in @xmath80 , we say that a vector field @xmath81 on the closure of @xmath108 with values in @xmath62 is compatible if it is the unique vector field satisfying the following div / curl type system : @xmath109 + therefore in section [ chap2 ] we will prove the following .",

    "+ then we expand the coefficients of the previous normal form in the zero - radius limit and repeatedly use lamb s lemma to reformulate under an asymptotic normal form closer to the one of the unbounded case where the leading terms of the electric - type force are absorbed in the other terms by a modulation of the unknown .",
    "indeed we will consider in particular as new unknown a quantity obtained by subtracting a drift velocity given by the leading terms of the electric - type potential from the translation velocity .",
    "this will allow to extend to this case the vanishingly small limit , still in both cases of a limit pointwise particle which is massive or massless .",
