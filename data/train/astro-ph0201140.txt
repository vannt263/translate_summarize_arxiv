    "although the sub - stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has been studied in a range of environments such as star - forming clusters ( luhman et al .",
    "1998 ; luhman 2000 ; najita et al .",
    "2000 ) , young open clusters ( bouvier et al . 1998 ; barrado y navascues et al .",
    "2001 ) and the field ( reid et al . 1999 ) , the imf of low - mass companions is not well understood , especially at `` wide '' ( @xmath3100au ) separations .",
    "radial velocity searches around solar - type main sequence stars ( e.g. , mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1996 ) have produced few confirmed brown dwarfs at separations @xmath43au .",
    "fewer than 0.5% of their sample have brown dwarf companions at those separations . a coronagraphic search for companions in the range 40 - 100au ( oppenheimer et al . 2001 )",
    "produced only one brown dwarf , gj 229b ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ) , well below the 17 - 30% multiplicity observed for all stars ( reid & gizis 1997 ) .",
    "other types of surveys , such as high spatial resolution space - based observations ( lowrance et al . 1999 ; lowrance et al .",
    "2000 ) and ground - based adaptive optics ( els et al .",
    "2001 ) , have also resulted in discoveries of low - mass stellar and sub - stellar companions .",
    "however , the frequency of stellar and sub - stellar companions at close separations remains distinctly different , resulting in the idea that there is a `` brown dwarf desert '' .",
    "to date there has been only one systematic search for brown dwarf companions at wide separations and with a volume - limited sample ( simons et al .",
    "1996 ; hereafter , shk ) .",
    "this was mainly a color - based search around m dwarfs within 8pc of the sun and did not turn up any new brown dwarfs , although , given the surprisingly blue colors of gj 229b , cool brown dwarfs with intermediate @xmath2-@xmath5 colors may have been overlooked in the survey .",
    "proper motion searches for companions have been used for many years to identify low - mass objects ( e.g. , van biesbroeck 1961 ) and offer a less biased way of finding low - mass companions than color - based surveys .",
    "therefore , we have conducted the planned second epoch survey of the shk sample , in order to identify low - mass companions to m dwarfs at wide separations out to over 1000au .",
    "the choice of m dwarf primaries is significant : reid & gizis ( 1997 ) and reid et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that the distribution of mass ratios for a sample of 80% m dwarfs has a peak at @xmath6 0.95 , where @xmath7 is the ratio of the secondary mass to the primary mass .",
    "they conclude that their sample shows a distinct bias towards approximately equal - mass systems and that the mass function for stellar companions is different from the imf of field stars . if these conclusions extend to brown dwarf masses , m primaries may harbor more sub - stellar companions than other stellar types . on the other hand ,",
    "reipurth & clarke ( 2001 ) suggest that brown dwarfs have been ejected by dynamical interactions during the star formation process and can not accrete enough mass to become stars . in this case m dwarf primaries",
    "may not be accompanied by such companions except in a multiple m dwarf systems with a correspondingly large gravitational potential .",
    "thus , our proper motion search around one spectral class of primaries fills a unique niche in the search for low - mass stellar and brown dwarf companions .",
    "we describe the data acquisition and reduction in @xmath82 and discuss the results of the survey in @xmath83 .",
    "our sample is identical to henry s ( 1991 ) list of m dwarfs within 8pc of the sun .",
    "the m dwarfs were chosen initially from the second catalog of nearby stars ( gliese 1969 ) and its updates ( gliese & jahreiss 1979 ) along with other additions from more recent literature ( e.g. , lhs 292 ; see shk for more details ) .",
    "the sample consists of 75 m dwarf primaries with m@xmath9@xmath108.0 mag , trigonometric parallaxes @xmath100@xmath11125 and declinations north of @xmath1 .",
    "shk observed 66 of these systems , discarding three due to confusion toward the galactic plane ( gj 701 , gj 729 , and gj 752 ) , leaving a total of 63 systems .",
    "of the original 75 systems , we observed 74 targets .",
    "table 1 contains a list of the targets , their proper motions , the dates of observation and those of shk , and other relevant parameters .",
    "the median distance of the m dwarf targets is 5.8pc , corresponding to a median search radius of 1480au in the present survey . over the complete distance range ,",
    "the search radius varies from 800 - 2100au .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of total proper motions of our objects between the first and second epoch observations . due to discoveries of new objects and to the measurement of more accurate parallaxes , the shk list is no longer a complete volume - limited sample .",
    "table 1 has five objects from the original sample whose updated parallaxes move them beyond the 8pc limit ( gj 185 , gj 623 , gj 686 , gj 1230 , and gj 884 ) and separately lists four objects whose redetermined parallaxes or recent discoveries ( e.g. , g 180 - 060 ; ducourant et al . 1998 ) place them within the survey criteria .",
    "first epoch images ( shk ) were obtained at the university of hawaii s 24-inch telescope between 1991 august and 1992 august with a facility 256 x 256 nicmos camera in both the @xmath2 and @xmath12 bands with a scale of 2@xmath110pixel@xmath13 .",
    "exposure times were typically 1 hour , and images were processed using conventional techniques .",
    "a custom program searched for point sources above a 3@xmath14 detection level and performed photometry on all sources using a 10@xmath15 aperture .    between 1998",
    "april and 2000 december , @xmath2-band images of the same fields were taken with the pisces camera ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2001 ) at the bok 2.3 m telescope on kitt peak .",
    "pisces has an 8@xmath165 diameter field - of - view and a 0@xmath115pixel@xmath13 plate scale at this telescope .",
    "nine 30 second exposures were obtained , centered on a program m dwarf , with a 10@xmath15 dither between each exposure .",
    "all images were corrected for quadrant cross - talk effects known to be present in hawaii arrays ( mccarthy et al .",
    "the images were then dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , masked for hot pixels , corrected for geometric distortion , and combined with standard iraf tasks .",
    "the flat - field was produced through a median combination of the dithered science frames .",
    "the flat - field is predictably poor in the region of the bright m star , which was allowed to saturate the detector .",
    "however , the flat - fielding does not affect the astrometry of the field , changing the position of the m dwarf by less than half a pixel in multiple test cases .",
    "also , because accurate photometry of the objects has already been carried out by shk , the resulting flat - field is adequate for this survey .",
    "figure 2 shows a sample fully reduced field ( gj 752 ) along with the identical field observed by shk .",
    "the field - of - view sizes are almost perfectly matched , except that pisces has a circular inscribed field .",
    "the shk images show an internal reflection due to the optics in the camera to the lower right of the m dwarf primary that is not in the second epoch set .",
    "the shk survey has a limiting magnitude of m@xmath17@xmath016.5 and is sensitive to companions down to 40 m@xmath18 assuming an age of 5gyr at the mean distance of the survey , 5.8pc , based on the models of burrows et al .",
    "we use 5gyr , following the findings of henry ( 1991 ) on this sample ; however , because age dating m dwarfs is difficult , 5gyr may not be an accurate average age .",
    "if the m dwarfs are instead 1gyr old , the survey is sensitive to 16 m@xmath18 . the sensitivity of the pisces images matches or exceeds that of the shk images in all cases with m@xmath17@xmath017.0 .",
    "each second epoch image is compared to its matching first epoch image using an iraf script originally designed to identify supernovae in nearby galaxies ( van dyk et al .",
    "2000 ) . using input coordinates of identical objects in the two frames , the script matches the pixel scales of the two cameras , accounts for any differences in geometric distortion , matches the point spread functions for the two images , and subtracts them .",
    "typically , 10 - 15 background stars from each m dwarf field were used as input references for the program .",
    "the total number of background stars ranges from 50 to over 1000 sources for the crowded fields near the galactic plane .",
    "the mean total proper motion of the m dwarfs between epochs is @xmath19 ( @xmath018 pixels on the pisces camera ) . moving objects",
    "are revealed by adjacent positive and negative images .",
    "companion objects would have proper motion vectors identical to the m dwarf primaries which have been accurately measured by hipparcos ( perryman et al .",
    ". objects with such large proper motions can easily be detected by visually examining the subtracted images .",
    "figure 3 shows the detection of the known low - mass companion van biesbroeck 10 ( vb 10 , gj 752b ) .",
    "other known wide companions were also detected as indicated with an asterisk in table 1 .",
    "these results demonstrate the reliability of the subtraction method .",
    "gj 570a , known to have a t dwarf companion at a separation of 258@xmath113 ( burgasser et al .",
    "2000 ) , was not included in the sample because the primary is a k4 dwarf .",
    "no new low - mass stellar or brown dwarf companions were detected in this 8pc sample of m dwarfs .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by shk from a @xmath2-@xmath12 color search .",
    "however , as many as nine wide ( 3600@xmath20@xmath21@xmath20120au ) companions have recently been detected around nearby ( 9.6 - 39pc ) stars using the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) database ( kirkpatrick et al . 2000 , 2001 ; burgasser et al . 2000 ; wilson et al . 2001 ) .",
    "seven of these new objects are common proper motion companions .",
    "in general , it is difficult to compare the 2mass results with the present survey because the 2mass primary stars have uncertain ages and generally higher luminosities .",
    "based on initial 2mass results , gizis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate that @xmath01% of primaries with masses 0.6 - 1.5m@xmath22 ( m@xmath9@xmath49.5 ) have wide ( @xmath201000au ) l dwarf companions and that the frequency of all wide brown dwarf companions is 5 - 13 times greater . extending this analysis to our m dwarf sample of 63 objects with masses between 0.08 - 0.6m@xmath22",
    ", we would expect to detect between 3 ( 5% of our sample ) and 9 ( 13% ) brown dwarf companions . the apparent difference between our results and gizis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) might be resolved if the frequency of brown dwarf companions depends strongly on primary mass and orbital separation .",
    "this possibility could be tested either by systematic data mining of the 2mass survey or by extending the present pisces survey to other spectral types .",
