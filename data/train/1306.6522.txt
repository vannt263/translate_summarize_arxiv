    "@xcite    in this paper , we propose to perform quantum computing based on electronic spin states @xcite in the two - dimensional topological insulators , also known as quantum spin hall systems ( qshs ) , which has been realized in both hgte / cdte @xcite and inas / gasb @xcite quantum wells .",

    "it is shown that a universal set of quantum gates can be achieved simply by the gate voltage control .",

    "our implementation of a universal set of the quantum gates is sketched in fig .",
    "two single - qubit gates are both composed by one piece of qsh as shown in fig .",

    "are required , which can be generated with the help of suitable voltage pulses .",
    "@xcite in the following , we consider an incoming wp with the lorentzian shape @xcite initially located at @xmath2 , which has the form of @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the the width of the wp .",
    "the entire wave function including the spin part can be expressed as @xmath6 is the initial spin state , @xmath7 creates an electron at @xmath8 with its spin @xmath9 taking the values of @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represents the vacuum state at zero temperature .",

    "( a ) a phase shift gate is realized by a gate voltage @xmath13 applied on the upper edge ; ( b ) a spin rotation around @xmath1 axis is achieved by tunneling between two edges in a quantum point contact structure ; ( c ) a two - qubit controlled phase gate is achieve via capacitive coulomb interaction ( shadow area ) between two adjacent edge channels from two parallel qshs.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the helical electrons in the edge states can be well described by the massless dirac equation , and the back scattering within one edge is completely suppressed even when nonmagnetic impurities and potential barriers exist . here , we focus on the right moving electrons only , and the edge channels are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dirac velocity . due to the spin - momentum locking , electrons with spin @xmath10 and @xmath11 transport rightward in the upper and lower edge channels , respectively .",
    "the spatial separation of opposite spins allows one to manipulate the spin states by applying electrical potential on the edge channels , which is easier to implement compared with the magnetic method .",
    "the phase gate @xmath16 operating on the spin state @xmath17 can be achieved by depositing a side gate on the upper edge channel as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , which can be expressed by the gating hamiltonian @xmath18 with @xmath13 being the gate voltage , applied on the region @xmath19 .",
    "such a side gate configuration has been studied in the interferometer structures in qshs by the plane - wave ansatez .",
    "@xcite here , by contrast , we focus on the propagation of a spatially localized wp in eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) , for the purpose of on - demand control over the electronic spin , which is not an eigenstate of the total hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] , [ hg ] ) .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that , localized wp of massless dirac electron can transport without any dispersion , just as the light travels in vacuum .",
    "one can see this directly through the equation of motion of the field operator in the interaction picture @xmath20 , @xmath21.\\ ] ] solving the equation then leads to the result @xmath22 which says that for any kind of wp , it can transport along the edge channels with a velocity @xmath15 , while keeping its shape unchanged .    we consider that at @xmath23 , an incoming wp in the form of eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) is located around @xmath2 . in the interaction picture , the gating hamiltonian is @xmath24 , which is now dependent on time .",
    "the wave function in the interaction picture can be calculated as well under the evolution of the gating hamiltonian by @xmath25 , and the result is @xmath26 finally , the wave function in the schrdinger picture can be obtained through the relation @xmath27 , or specifically , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the step function , and the width of the wp is assumed to be narrow compared with the scale of the qsh , i.e. , @xmath30 . when the electron arrives at @xmath3 after a traveling time of @xmath31 , the additional phase accumulated in the upper channel is @xmath32 , provided that @xmath33 . as a result",
    ", the spin state can be expressed as @xmath34 after tracing out the spatial part of the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) , which manifests that the side gate can be utilized as a phase gate on electronic spin qubit .    more practically , taking the inas / gasb quantum wells as an example , @xcite where the dirac velocity is @xmath35 m/s , so a @xmath36-phase gate can be achieved by setting the length of the gating region to @xmath37 nm and applying a gate voltage of @xmath38mv .",
    "given that the phase coherence length of the edge channels in the inas / gasb quantum wells is @xmath39 , it is reasonable to expect a high quality of the gate , for the decoherence effect is negligible .      to perform universal quantum computing , we now further consider an operation which rotates the spin around the @xmath1 axis .",
    "such a quantum gate can be realized in a quantum point contact structure @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , and it has been utilized in several quantum information processing tasks based on electronic spins .",
    "@xcite according to the study done by krueckl and richter , @xcite there exists an energy window in hgte / cdte quantum wells , where the amplitudes of electron scattering between edges can be adjusted to full range by a top gate @xmath40 , with the back scattering being completely suppressed simultaneously .",
    "this indicates that , within such an energy widow , the quantum point contact structure can serve as an ideal spin dependent beam splitter , which is just suitable for quantum computing . the rotation operation on spin around the @xmath1 axis by an angle @xmath41",
    "can be expressed effectively by @xmath42 , where @xmath41 is a function of the gate voltage and @xmath43 is the pauli matrix .",
    "a detail correspondence between @xmath41 and the voltage applied on the top gate can be found in ref . .",
    "for example , when the fermi energy takes the value @xmath44 , then the rotation by an angle of @xmath45 can be achieved by tuning the gate voltage to the value @xmath46mev . though the calculations are performed in the hgte / cdte quantum wells,@xcite it is reasonable to expect a qualitative same conclusion in inas / gasb quantum wells,@xcite given that the physics inside is independent on specific systems .",
    "the implementation of the single - qubit gates via electrical control as discussed in sec .",
    "[ ii ] also suggest that a two - qubit gate can be achieved by coulomb interaction between two electrons , which carry two spin qubits traveling through the edge channels .",
    "the structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , where a pair of qshs parallel to each other are utilized .",
    "the adjacent edge channels of the two qshs are coupled through the capacitive coulomb interaction ( the shadow area ) in the interaction region @xmath47 , where the tunneling between edges is forbidden .",
    "this can be realized by the deformation of the qsh edges , or through the gate voltage control on the expansion of the edge states in the direction perpendicular the edge .",
    "it is intuitive that , when the upper electron picks the spin down channel and the lower one chooses the spin up channel at the same time , a joint phase due to the interaction energy is accumulated , which is absent for all the other three spin configurations .",
    "this suggests a two - qubit controlled phase gate can be implemented through the on - demand coulomb interaction between electrons , which together with the two single - qubit gates can realize universal quantum computation .",
    "@xcite such coulomb interaction between edges has recently been proposed to measure the which - path information @xcite and generate orbital entanglement @xcite in the coupled mach - zehnder interferometer setup composed by the edge states in the quantum hall systems . here",
    "we generalize the discussion to qshs and utilize such an effect to perform quantum gate on the electronic spins .",
    "the incoming electron wave now contains one electron in each qsh , and takes the form @xmath48 where the subscripts 1 , 2 label the upper and lower qshs , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) and @xmath49 is a general two - spin state .",
    "the capacitive coulomb potential with an effective interacting length @xmath50 takes the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the density operator , @xmath53 is the interacting constant , and @xmath54 are the interaction kernels .",
    "@xcite    we now calculate the evolution of the two particle wave function .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in the interaction picture can be obtained as @xmath55 , with which the wave function in the interaction picture can be solved directly as @xmath56 the schrdinger wave function is obtained via @xmath57 with @xmath58 now describing two qshs and the final result is @xmath59 the additional phase shared by both electrons are the function of coordinates @xmath60 .",
    "after the electron pair traveling through the interaction region , the phase term has the following form @xmath61 where the desired constant phase is determined by @xmath62 .",
    "we would like to investigate the ideal case first , as the width of the wps is much smaller than the interacting length , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "this means the uncertainty of the electron positions are negligible , so as the uncertainty of the joint phase . as a result ,",
    "the general two - qubit state after traveling through the interaction region can be expressed as @xmath64 , by tracing out the spatial part of the wave function .",
    "therefore , a controlled phase gate @xmath65 is achieved by the on - demand coulomb interaction , which has the form of @xmath66",
    "practically , the wps always have finite width @xmath5 , and the injection of the wave pulse may not be perfectly synchronized as well , with a time delay of @xmath67 . as a result",
    ", the spin state is generally described by the reduced density matrix @xmath68 , or explicitly , @xmath69 with the matrix @xmath70 , and the phase term being defined by @xmath71 } { ( \\eta_1 ^ 2 + 1)(\\eta_2 ^ 2 + 1 ) } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 , with the dimensionless quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 describing the delay between the wave pulses and the width of the wp , in scale of the screening length .",
    "the expression of @xmath75 suggests that it is not a simple exponential function with modulus 1 , due to the finite width of the wp .",
    "the reason is that , the phase shift @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) is a function of coordinates of both electrons . as a result",
    ", the probabilistic feature of the coordinates leads to the uncertainty of the phase @xmath76 , or equivalently , spin decoherence , which is reflected by the suppression of the interference term .     as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath78.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]     as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath78.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to investigate the effect of the pulse delay and finite width of the wps mentioned above , we assume @xmath79 in @xmath65 and the input two - spin state is @xmath80",
    ". the fidelity of the two - qubit gate can be defined by @xmath81 , which quantifies the closeness between the actually obtained final state and the target state , @xcite and can be obtained as @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "the expression of @xmath84 indicates that both the decoherence effect , which causes @xmath85 , and an unexpected phase shift @xmath86 , will reduce the fidelity .",
    "alternatively , we can also define the gate purity by @xmath87 to characterize the effects of decoherence on the gate , @xcite which has the form of @xmath88 where we see that only the modulus of @xmath75 enters the expression .",
    "numerical results for both the fidelity @xmath84 and purity @xmath89 of the gate as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the imperfectness of synchronization has a negligible effect compared with the finite width of the wps , for the main effect of the former is the reduction of the presetting phase @xmath90 . in contrast",
    ", the finite width of the wps which introduces the decoherence effect has considerable impact on both the fidelity and purity . as a result , in order to realize a two - qubit gate with high fidelity , the width of the wps is required to be sufficiently narrow .",
    "fortunately , recent progresses on the coherent single electron source shows the feasibility of our proposal .",
    "it has been reported that the emission time of a single electron pulse can reach the accuracy of picosecond , i.e. , @xmath91ps , @xcite which means the width of the wp in the edge channels of inas / gasb quantum wells @xcite may reach a value of @xmath92 nm .",
    "therefore , by taking the interacting length of @xmath93 nm , the fidelity and purity of the controlled phase gate can reach the values of 93.3% and 89.0% , respectively .    in the above calculation , the inherent decoherence effect @xcite due to the interaction with the fermi",
    "see is assumed to be weak .",
    "@xcite practically , the strength of the screened coulomb interaction depends on the geometrical parameters of the quantum wells , which can range from the weakly interacting to strongly interacting limit .",
    "@xcite it is also worth noting that , the decoherence caused by coulomb interaction in the luttinger liquids can be partly or even fully undone with the help of a suitable voltage pulse .",
    "@xcite consequently , the quantum computing scheme based on electronic spins seems rather promising within the qsh framework .",
    "we have shown that a universal set of quantum gates on electronic spins can be realized by electrically controlled wp propagation in the edge channels of qshs .",
    "it is promising to reach satisfactory fidelity and purity of the quantum gates based on the existing experimental techniques , such as the high - quality single electron sources .",
    "@xcite we find that inas / gasb quantum wells is a better candidate for the implementation of quantum computing compared with hgte / cdte quantum wells , which has a slower dirac velocity and a longer phase coherence length . @xcite a braiding proposal in qshs",
    "has been put forward recently , @xcite and it has been proved that the transfer between spin states and topological qubits is advisable due to the spin polarization of majorana fermions .",
    "@xcite therefore , the spin qubits can serve as the ancillary qubits to perform several quantum operations which can not be achieved by braiding , such as the @xmath36 and controlled phase gates .",
    "these conventional quantum gates combined with braiding operations over majorana fermions may achieve universal quantum computation with a high error threshold in qshs .",
