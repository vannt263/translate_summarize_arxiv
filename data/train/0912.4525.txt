    "glass ceramics in @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6 ( las ) systems have attracted a lot of attention over the last several decades due to their low or even negative coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) , as well as due to their chemical and thermal stability.@xcite this class of materials has been extensively commercialized owing to their exotic physical properties which makes them suitable for industrial applications ( e.g. , heat exchangers ) which require dimensional stability and thermal shock resistance.@xcite they are also used in very specific applications like telescope mirror blanks , high precision optical devices and ring laser gyroscope.@xcite the hexagonal @xmath0-eucryptite is a prominent member of this class of materials .",
    "it has a highly anisotropic cte@xcite ( i.e. , @xmath7 7.26 @xmath8 perpendicular to the @xmath1 axis , @xmath9 -16.35 @xmath8 parallel to the @xmath1 axis ) which leads to a slightly negative crystallographic average ( bulk ) cte .",
    "@xmath0-eucryptite undergoes a reversible order - disorder structural transition at @xmath10 755 k.@xcite it exhibits one dimensional superionic conductivity of li@xmath11 ions along the @xmath1-axis which makes it a suitable electrolyte in li based batteries.@xcite most of these unusual properties of @xmath0-eucryptite are , in part , related to its crystal structure .",
    "figure [ fig : crystal ] illustrates a unit cell of @xmath0-eucryptite below the order - disorder transition containing 84 atoms with 12 unit formulae of lialsio@xmath12 . a single crystal of ordered @xmath0-eucryptite , as shown by figure [ fig : crystal ] has a primitive hexagonal structure belonging to the @xmath13 space group.@xcite",
    "this structure is a derivative of the @xmath0-quartz configuration , with half the si@xmath14 ions replaced by al@xmath15 while the charge imbalance is compensated by the channels of li@xmath16 ions parallel to the @xmath1-axis.@xcite several researchers@xcite have demonstrated through structural refinements that the structure is composed of interconnected helices of sio@xmath17 and alo@xmath18 tetrahedra with alternation of layers containing si and al atoms respectively , leading to a doubling of the @xmath1-axis of @xmath0-quartz .",
    "as mentioned , the slightly negative crystallographic average cte of @xmath0-eucryptite is due to the anisotropy of the linear expansion where a temperature increase involves a contraction along the @xmath1-axis which overcompensates the concomitant expansion in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath1-axis .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain this unusual thermal behavior.@xcite hortal _ _ et al.__@xcite employed a three - terminal technique@xcite to measure the linear compressibility @xmath19 of @xmath0-eucryptite along the @xmath20 and @xmath1 axes , and the reported values of @xmath21 gpa@xmath22 and @xmath23 gpa@xmath22 .",
    "these measured values of @xmath19 supported the explanation given by gillery and bush@xcite that the negative bulk thermal expansion is an elastic effect associated with the interconnected helices of si and al tetrahedra .",

    "it should be noted that @xmath2 calculated using the experimentally known @xmath24 is positive , in contrast to the negative value of @xmath27 gpa determined by direct measurements.@xcite while the sign of the direct measurement of @xmath2 remains in doubt due to experimental uncertainty , the near - zero value is also very different from that obtained in calculations . since the sign of @xmath2 is linked with the explanation of negative cte of @xmath0-eucryptite , it is necessary to address and possibly resolve the contradiction surrounding the sign of @xmath2 .    in this paper , we compute the elastic stiffness constants of ordered @xmath0-eucryptite containing 84 atoms per unit cell in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "we then use the elastic constants to evaluate the linear compressibilities @xmath3 and @xmath2 to clarify the sign of linear compressibility parallel to the @xmath1-axis .",
    "since the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations offer an independent method of determining the linear compressibility , the present study can resolve the discrepancy discussed above .",
    "after ascertaining the sign of @xmath2 , we discuss its implications on the explanation of negative crystallographic average cte of @xmath0-eucryptite .",
    "we demonstrate that the negative cte of @xmath0-eucryptite must arise from a combination of several interconnected phenomena as suggested by xu _",
