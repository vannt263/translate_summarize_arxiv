    "a theorem of fuglede @xcite states that a set tiles @xmath0 by lattice translation if and only if it has an orthonormal basis of exponentials @xmath1 with @xmath2 in the dual lattice .",
    "such a set is called a spectral set .",
    "the theorem suggests that one can study fourier series and approximation on a spectral set . for the simplest spectral sets , cubes in @xmath3 , we are in the familiar territory of classical ( multiple ) fourier series . for other spectral sets , such a study has mostly remained at the structural property in the @xmath4 level and it seems to have attracted little attention among researchers in approximation theory .    besides the usual rectangular domain",
    ", the simplest spectral set is a regular hexagon on the plane , which has been studied in connection with fourier analysis in @xcite . recently in @xcite , discrete fourier analysis on lattices",
    "was developed and the case of hexagon lattice was studied in detail ; in particular , lagrange interpolation and cubature formulas by trigonometric functions on a regular hexagon and on an equilateral triangle were studied . here",
    "we follow the set up in @xcite to study the summability of fourier series and approximation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show , using the hexagonal domain as an example , that fourier series on a spectral set has a rich structure that permits an extensive theory of fourier expansions and approximation .",
    "it is our hope that this work may stimulate further studies in this area .",
    "it should be mentioned that , in response to a problem on construction and analysis of hexagonal optical elements , orthogonal polynomials on the hexagon were studied in @xcite in which a method of generating an orthogonal polynomial basis was developed .",
    "we study orthogonal expansion and approximation by trigonometric functions on the hexagon domain .    in comparison to the usual fourier series for periodic functions in both variables on the plane , the periodicity of the fourier series on a hexagonal domain is defined in terms of the hexagon lattice , which has the symmetry of the reflection group @xmath5 with reflections along the edges of the hexagon .",
    "the functions that we consider are periodic under the translation of hexagonal lattice .",
    "it turns out ( @xcite ) that it is convenient to use homogenous coordinates that satisfy @xmath6 in @xmath7 rather than coordinates in @xmath8 .",
    "using homogenous coordinates allows us to treat the three directions equally and it reveals symmetry in various formulas that are not obvious in @xmath8 coordinates . as we shall show below , many results and formulas resemble closely to those of fourier analysis and approximation on @xmath9 periodic functions .",
    "fourier analysis on the hexagonal domain can be approached from several directions .",
    "orthogonal exponentials on the hexagonal domain are related to trigonometric functions on an equilateral triangle , upon considering symmetric exponentials on the hexagonal domain .",
    "these trigonometric functions arise from solutions of laplacian on the equilateral triangle , as seen in @xcite and developed extensively in @xcite , and they are closely related to orthogonal algebraic polynomials on the domain bounded by steiner s hyercycloid @xcite , much as chebyshev polynomials arise from exponentials .",
    "in fact , the trigonometric functions arise from the exponentials by symmetry are called generalized cosine functions in @xcite , and there are also generalized sine functions that are anti - symmetric .",
    "our results on the hexagonal domain can be easily translated to results in terms of generalized cosines .",
    "our results on summability can also be translated to orthogonal expansions of algebraic polynomials on the domain bounded by hypercycloid , but the same can not be said on our results on best approximation .",
    "in fact , just like the case of best approximation by polynomial on the interval , the approximation should be better at the boundary for polynomial approximation on the hypercycloid domain .",
    "for example , our bernstein type inequality ( theorem 4.8 ) can be translated into a markov type inequality for algebraic polynomials .",
    "a modulus of smoothness will need to be defined to take into account of the boundary effect of the hypercycloid domain , which is not trivial and will not be considered in this paper .",
    "some of our results , especially those on the best approximation , can be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "we choose to stay on the hexagonal domain to keep an uniformity of the paper and to stay away from overwhelming notations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "definitions and background materials will be given in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we study the abel summability , aka poisson integral , and cesro @xmath10 means of the fourer series on the hexagon , where several compact formulas for the kernel functions will be deduced .",
    "one interesting result shows that the @xmath11 means are nonnegative , akin to the fejr means for the classical fourier series . in section 4",
    "we study best approximation by trigonometric functions on the hexagonal domain and establish both direct and inverse theorems in terms of a modulus of smoothness .",
    "below we briefly sum up what we need on fourier analysis on hexagonal domain .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "the hexagonal lattice is given by @xmath12 , where the matrix @xmath13 and the spectral set @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the reason that @xmath14 contains only half of its boundary is given in @xcite .",
    "we will use homogeneous coordinates @xmath16 that satisfies @xmath6 for which the hexagonal domain @xmath14 becomes @xmath17 which is the intersection of the plane @xmath18 with the cube @xmath19 ^ 3 $ ] , as seen in figure 1 .     and in @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   and in @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=37.5% ]    the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 for convenience , we adopt the convention of using bold letters , such as @xmath23 , to denote points in the space @xmath24 in other words , bold letters such as @xmath23 stand for homogeneous coordinates . if we treat @xmath25 and @xmath26 as column vectors , then it follows from that @xmath27 upon using the fact that @xmath28 .",
    "computing the jacobian of the change of variables shows that @xmath29 . a function @xmath30 is called _ periodic _ with respect to the hexagonal lattice , if @xmath31 we call such a function @xmath13-periodic . in homogeneous coordinates",

    "we define @xmath43 these exponential functions are orthogonal with respect to @xmath44 .",

    "it enjoys a compact formula given by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that @xmath70 where @xmath71 this last formula is our starting point for studying summability of fourier series in the following section .",
    "we will also need to use the poisson summation formula associated with the hexagonal lattice .",
    "this formula takes the form ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath72 where for @xmath73 the fourier transform @xmath74 and its inverse are defined by @xmath75 and the formula holds under the usual assumption on the convergence of the series in both sides .",

    "by @xmath87 we mean that there are two constants @xmath86 and @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",
    "we consider hexagonal summability of fourier series ; that is , we write the fourier series as blocks whose indices are grouped according to @xmath56 : @xmath90 from now on we call such a series hexagonal fourier series .",

    "let us introduce a notation that @xmath353 .",
    "since @xmath354 , we can write @xmath346 as @xmath355 in particular , for @xmath356 , we have @xmath357 an immediate consequence of this expression is that @xmath358    define @xmath359 such that @xmath360 . then @xmath361 the definition of @xmath359 and poisson summation formula shows that @xmath362 in order to estimate the right hand side we first derive an upper bound for @xmath359 . since @xmath333 is a @xmath334 function and @xmath363 is differentiable except when one of the variable is zero , taking derivatives in @xmath364 norm , we end up with @xmath365          e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{3 } \\sb \\cdot \\tb } d\\sb.\\ ] ] each derivative of @xmath366 yields a @xmath367 . for @xmath368 and @xmath369 , we have @xmath370       & = \\sum_{|\\g| \\le k } \\binom{k}{\\g } n^{-k+|\\g| } \\eta^{(k-|\\g| ) }         \\left(\\tfrac{|\\tb|_h}{n}\\right )   \\partial^{\\g } \\tb^\\a \\\\      & =   \\sum_{|\\g| \\le |\\a| } \\binom{|\\b|}{\\g } n^{-k+|\\g| } \\eta^{(k-|\\g| ) }         \\left(\\tfrac{|\\tb|_h}{n}\\right ) \\frac{\\a!}{\\g ! } \\tb^{\\a -\\g } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used muti - index notations that for @xmath371 and @xmath372 , @xmath373 and @xmath374 .",
