    "<S> the traditional view of nuclear - spin decoherence in a field gradient due to molecular self - diffusion is challenged on the basis of temperature dependence of the linewidth , which demonstrates different behaviors between liquids and gases . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional theory predicts that in a fluid , linewidth should increase with temperature ; however , in gases we observed the opposite behavior . this surprising behavior can be explained using a more detailed theoretical description of the dephasing function that accounts for position autocorrelation effects </S>",
    "<S> .    for over six decades , diffusion - weighted nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) has been the flagship experiment for measurements of molecular self - diffusion in free or confined geometries . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion - based nmr experiments have a wide range of applications from porous media  @xcite , catalysis  @xcite , materials science and chemistry  @xcite to biomedicine  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider the simple experiment shown in fig .  [ pulsesequence ] , where the nuclear induction signal is read out in the presence of a magnetic - field gradient . </S>",
    "<S> the gradient modulates the magnetization spatially along the gradient s direction ( assuming a sufficiently strong external field so that the gradient is unidirectional ) . </S>",
    "<S> time evolution of this magnetization in the presence of diffusion effects provides a direct and unambiguous measurement of the self - diffusion process . in the traditional description of molecular self - diffusion  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a molecule undergoes a random walk whereby at each time step , the nuclear spins accumulate phase increments that are randomly drawn from a normal distribution . in the presence of a magnetic - field gradient </S>",
    "<S> , the decoherence of the nuclear induction signal @xmath0 follows the well - known textbook expression  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath3 is the self - diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 is the applied gradient strength , and @xmath5 is time . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 dependence has been extensively validated and has been utilized to measure molecular self - diffusion coefficients in a wide variety of liquids  @xcite . in a gas , however , the situation is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of a normally - distributed phase accumulation at every time step is difficult to justify in light of the fact that gas molecules undergo much more rapid motion than in liquids , due to much longer free displacements between collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the farther the molecular displacements along the direction of the gradient , the faster the nuclear spins will lose memory of their immediate environment . </S>",
    "<S> this memory loss should be expected to enter the description of the decoherence process . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , this simple aspect of free diffusion is still lacking a thorough experimental verification .     </S>",
    "<S> measurement of molecular self - diffusion in a constant field gradient . </S>",
    "<S> a 90@xmath7 radiofrequency ( rf ) pulse tips the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this resulting nuclear induction signal is measured in a constant gradient of amplitude @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of magnetization , as described by the textbook  @xcite expression  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , interrogates the molecular self - diffusion process.,width=151 ]    the nmr signal , @xmath0 , from an ensemble of spins initially located at @xmath8 is given by the expectation value of the phase factor : @xmath9 where @xmath10 describes the time - dependent resonance frequency offset ( in the rotating frame ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the presence of a magnetic field gradient @xmath4 , the resonance frequency is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , the position of the nuclear spin after time @xmath5 , is a random process . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume a gaussian random process that is stationary in the wide sense , this expectation value takes the form  @xcite : @xmath13    the first term , @xmath14 , encodes the position in the phase of the spins  @xcite after undergoing displacement but does not lead to decoherence unless the diffusion is not free . </S>",
    "<S> the second term describes signal decay , and consequently , affects linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> more complicated random processes may lead to higher - order terms , but we shall limit our discussion to the case where @xmath12 is a wide - sense stationary gaussian random process .    over the timescale @xmath5 of the nmr measurement , liquid phase molecules experience displacements that are much smaller than those in the gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> we may write this as @xmath15 , for a liquid . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation , known as the einstein - fick limit , indicates that the position autocorrelation function can be approximated by the mean - square displacement : @xmath16 where @xmath3 is the self - diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> it is known from experiments that in liquids , this limit holds  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath17 and @xmath18 differ by three orders of magnitude , and it is unclear if this approximation also holds for gases . away from the einstein - fick limit , </S>",
    "<S> contributions from ballistic transport become significant . </S>",
    "<S> we note that substitution of the limit  ( [ eq:3 ] ) into the second term of ( [ eq:2 ] ) recovers the result ( [ eq:1 ] ) as a special case .    in this letter , we show that  ( [ eq:1 ] ) does not hold for gases based on the analysis of linewidth as function of temperature ( @xmath19 ) . because @xmath20 increases with @xmath19 ,  ( [ eq:1 ] ) predicts that linewidth should increase with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that gases instead undergo line narrowing with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is unclear by cursory inspection of  ( [ eq:1 ] ) how gases may differ from liquids , especially in light of the fact that the dependence of line broadening on diffusion coefficient has been verified experimentally in several studies ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the key to establishing this distinction is a closer look at the temperature dependence of the line broadening mechanism , as explained below .    in the nmr experiment , </S>",
    "<S> nuclear spins are well isolated from the lattice and do not depolarize or randomize their phases when undergoing molecular collisions , in contrast to collisional broadening mechanisms in optics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the description of line broadening in such a  </S>",
    "<S> weak collision \" regime reflects the histories of molecular displacements . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest way to account for this is through a position autocorrelation function . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the particle displacements are modeled using a generalized langevin equation ( gle ) with memory kernel : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass of the diffusing particle , @xmath23 is a memory kernel , @xmath24 is the particle velocity , @xmath25 is its acceleration , and @xmath26 is a stochastic force . </S>",
    "<S> the gle has been validated experimentally for brownian particles ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mass of fluid particles ) ; for example , in the studies  @xcite @xmath22 was @xmath29 times larger than @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> so while the gle was not designed to model self - diffusion processes , it can be invoked to model viscous drag effects via the memory kernel . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we shall set @xmath30 , which is the only regime we are aware of , where the gle has been validated experimentally based on direct measurements of individual histories ( namely , in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , the stochastic force @xmath26 describes colored noise , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is boltzmann s constant . </S>",

    "<S> , we may obtain the overall temperature by modeling @xmath42 using the stokes law , @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , shear viscosity of the medium ; @xmath58 , sphere diameter ) , which holds in the limit of low reynolds numbers and invoking the sutherland s formula  @xcite for @xmath57 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is sutherland s constant for the gas , @xmath61 is the viscosity at temperature @xmath62 . at low temperatures , @xmath63 , whereas at high temperatures , @xmath64 . by substituting this into  ( [ eq:11 ] ) </S>",

    "<S> an analogous expression in the case of liquids can be derived using a suitable model for the temperature dependence of the viscosity in a liquid . however , this will not be needed here , because we shall see that the linewidth is essentially independent of temperature .    </S>",
