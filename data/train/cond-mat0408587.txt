    "the doping dependence of the high - temperature superconductors ( htscs ) has become a significant issue due to pseudogap phenomena in underdoped compounds and to the peculiar influence of hole carrier density on properties of superconducting and normal states . among the htscs",

    "la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 has a structural phase transformation between the underdoped and overdoped regimes.@xcite meanwhile , changing carrier density through cation substitution probably leads to local distortion due to the size effect.@xcite although the carrier density in yba@xmath1cu@xmath7o@xmath8 can be tuned by oxygen content , the occurrence of chain oxygen sites in this material complicates interpretation of much of the experimental data .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to make even slightly overdoped samples in this system , only the underdoped part of the phase diagram can be thoroughly studied . by comparison",
    ", bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 is a perfect candidate for studying its physical properties over a wide range of the doping .    in order to get insight into the basic mechanism responsible for high - temperature superconductivity , one always strives to observe the possible change of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 at fixed doping level .",
    "pressure has been realized to be an effective way to change @xmath0 for a compound . however , the effect of pressure on @xmath0 is very complicated .",
    "the pressure derivative of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , can vary from positive to negative , which strongly depends on the doping level . for",
    "most optimally doped compounds,@xcite @xmath0 generally increases when pressure is applied at the initial stage , passes through a saturation at some critical pressure level @xmath3 , then decreases modestly at high pressures .",
    "bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 is the only known system where the constantly positive @xmath9 is not sensitive to oxygen content,@xcite which makes it an ideal system to investigate the phase diagram between the saturated @xmath0 and critical pressure @xmath3 over an entire doping regime .",
    "early measurements on the 80@xmath1088 k samples@xcite have shown that for the sample with a relatively high @xmath0 it is easy to reach the saturation at the beginning of the pressure range .",
    "it was also shown that the @xmath3 shifts to higher pressure with additional oxygen content in the overdoped side.@xcite it remains unclear whether the saturation in the @xmath0 versus @xmath11 curve is present for samples away from optimal doping .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study the pressure dependence of @xmath0 as well as the high - pressure phase diagram in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 over the entire doping range .",
    "experiments carried out on a variety of htscs@xcite have revealed that @xmath0 is not a unique function of pressure but depends strongly on the temperature at which the pressure is applied . for almost all systems ,",
    "pressure - induced relaxation effects become activated for temperatures above 200 k. the pressure derivative @xmath9 can be increased tenfold if the pressure is changed at room temperature rather than at low temperatures.@xcite since the relaxation is believed to be frozen at low temperatures , the pressure dependence of @xmath0 and the pressure derivative @xmath9 basically represent the intrinsic pressure effect . such an effect most directly reflects changes in the basic physical properties , including",
    "the pairing interaction itself , and thus is most valuable for comparison with theory .",
    "it is therefore of interest to perform detailed measurements of @xmath12 under high pressure by changing pressure at low temperatures to elucidate the intrinsic pressure effects .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a high - pressure study of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals in which the pressure is applied and measured at low temperatures .",
    "the characteristic nonmonotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature is found in our crystals ranging from heavily underdoped to heavily overdoped samples .",
    "we obtain a new high - pressure phase diagram between the saturation of @xmath0 and critical pressure @xmath3 at which @xmath0 is saturated .",
    "we demonstrate that the nonmonotonic behavior originates from a competition between the hole carrier density and pairing interaction strength .",

    "a 10 - 90% transition width of 0.5 k in susceptibility of our samples is indicative of very good quality and of high homogeneity in both cation and oxygen concentrations.@xcite    we performed the measurements of @xmath0 under high pressures using a highly sensitive magnetic susceptibility technique with diamond anvil cells.@xcite this technique has been proven to be especially successful in the discovery of superconductivity in compressed sulphur and lithium.@xcite the technique is based on the quenching of the superconductivity and suppression of the meissner effect in the superconducting sample by an external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of the metallic parts of the high - pressure cells is essentially independent of the external field .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field applied to the sample inserted in the diamond cell mainly affects the change of the signal coming from the sample .",
    "if we apply an alternating low - frequency ( @xmath16 hz ) magnetic field with an amplitude below 100 oe , then the output signal changes twice per period of the magnetic field , because the positive and negative magnetic fields act identically to destroy the superconducting state .",

    "this difference might be due to the difference of the samples and/or the difference in the hydrostaticity of the pressure medium used .     with applied pressure up to 18 gpa for a bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal which is nearly optimally doped but slightly overdoped .",

    "compared to the maximum value of @xmath31 k in flux - grown bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 at optimal doping , the present sample with a @xmath0 of 60 k is heavily overdoped .",
    "the occurrence of the saturation in the @xmath12 curve in our sample is very interesting , since it has never been reported in such a heavily overdoped cuprate where the significant change of @xmath0 is tuned only through oxygen content rather than cation substitution .",
    "considering the fact that @xmath0 would decrease with further adding oxygen content in the overdoped regime , this result clearly indicates that neither the pressure - induced charge transfer@xcite nor the pressure - induced oxygen doping@xcite is solely responsible for the pressure effect on @xmath0 .",
    "the observed saturation in the @xmath12 curve also suggests that another intrinsic variable independent of the hole carrier density is playing a significant role in enhancing @xmath0 at even the heavily overdoped region .     at the ambient pressure ( open circles ) and critical pressure @xmath3 ( solid circles ) in flux - grown bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals as a function of @xmath0 referenced to the maximum value of 90 k. ]    among the results obtained in these experiments , the most important",

    "the saturation of @xmath0 under the critical pressure of a hole - doped cuprate has been shown to cover the heavily underdoped to heavily overdoped regime . despite extensive effort to reaching the saturation at the critical pressure",

    "the saturation @xmath32 was only found in either the underdoped side@xcite or the overdoped side.@xcite",
    "to understand the experimentally observed nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath12 of these samples , we use a simple @xmath33-wave bcs formalism : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the quasiparticle dispersion , @xmath37 is the number of @xmath38 vectors , @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath40 is the in - plane pairing interaction strength .",
