    "the precise physics of simple atom is the most interesting part of the so - called low - energy tests of quantum electrodynamics ( _ qed _ ) .",
    "low energy tests of qed offer a number of different options :    * a study with free particles provides the possibility of testing the qed lagrangian for free particles .",
    "the most accurate data arise from anomalous magnetic moments of the electron ( _ kinoshita_@xmath3 correspond to presentations at a satellite meeting to icap named _ hydrogen atom , 2 : precision physics of simple atomic system _ and its proceedings will be published by springer in 2001 . ] ) and the muon @xcite .",
    "* however , one knows that the bound problem makes all calculations more complicated .",
    "bound state qed is not a well  established theory .",
    "it involves different effective approaches to solve a two  body problem .",
    "these approaches can be essentially checked with low @xmath0 atomic systems like for e. g. hydrogen and deuterium ( _ hnsch_@xmath3 ) , neutral helium ( _ drake_@xmath3 ) and helium ions , muonium ( _ jungmann_@xmath3 ) , positronium ( _ conti_@xmath3 ) , muonic hydrogen and helium etc .",
    "we consider here most of the low@xmath0 atoms .",
    "* study of high@xmath0 ions ( _ myers_@xmath3 , _",
    "stlker_@xmath3 ) can not further the test of the bound state qed because of large contributions due to the nuclear structure .",
    "rather such an investigation is useful for trying different nuclear models .",
    "however , in some particular cases , atomic systems with a not too high @xmath0 can give some important information on higher order terms of the qed @xmath4 expansion .",
    "* there are some other two  body atoms under investigation .",
    "they contain a hadron as an orbiting particle .",
    "different antiprotonic ( _ yamazaki_@xmath3 ) and pionic ( _ nemenov_@xmath3 ) atoms provide a unique opportunity to study particle property with spectroscopic means with a high precision . in some sense",
    "it is not possible to have low precision : if a signal is detected the accuracy is granted .",
    "the precision study of the simple atoms is not only limited by experiments with simple atoms .",
    "the theory is not able to predict anything to be comparable to the experimental data .",
    "what theory can do is to express a measurable quantity in terms of fundamental constants and particle ( or nuclear ) properties .",
    "first of all we need to determine somehow the rydberg constant ( @xmath5 ) , the fine structure constant ( @xmath6 ) and the electron mass in some appropriate units ( e. g. in atomic units or in terms of the proton mass ( @xmath7 ) ) .",
    "uncertainties arising from these constants are sometimes compatible with other items of the uncertainty budget or they are even sometimes the most important source of inaccuracy",
    ". one should remember that the electron is the most fundamental particle for physics , chemistry , and metrology and the constants associated with its properties go through any atomic spectroscopic effects and any quantum electromagnetic effects .",
    "due to that a number of different studies , which are very far from the spectroscopy of simple atoms ( like e. g. watt balance experiment ( see _ mohr_@xmath3 for detail ) ) , are really strongly connected with the precision physics of simple atoms",
    ".    however , a knowledge of the universal fundamental constants is not enough for precision theoretical predictions and we need to learn also some more specific constants like for e. g. the muon mass or the proton electric charge radius .",
    "the former is important for the muonium hyperfine structure , while the latter is for calculating the hydrogen lamb shift .",
    "let us discuss the spectrum of simple atoms in more detail .",
    "the gross structure of atomic levels in a hydrogen  like atom comes from the schdinger equation with the coulomb potential and the result is well  known . ]",
    "there are a number of different corrections : the relativistic ones ( one can find them from the dirac equation ) , the hyperfine structure ( due to the nuclear magnetic moment ) and the qed ones .",
    "a structure of levels with the same value of the principal quantum number @xmath9 is a signature of any atomic system . in fig .",
    "1 we present three different spectra of the structure at @xmath10 . the first one is realized in `` normal '' ( electronic ) hydrogen  like atoms ( hydrogen , deuterium , helium ions etc ) .",
    "the muonium spectrum is the same .",
    "the largest splitting , of order @xmath11 , is the fine structure ( i. e. the splitting between levels with a different value of the electron angular momentum @xmath12 ) , the lamb shift arising from the electron self ",
    "energy effects is of order @xmath13 and it splits the levels with the same @xmath12 and different values of the electron orbital momentum @xmath14 . some nuclei are spinless ( like e. g. in @xmath15he ) , while others have a non  zero spin ( in hydrogen , deuterium , muonium , helium3 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the nuclear spin splits levels with the same electronic quantum number .",
    "the splitting are of order @xmath16 or @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the nuclear mass , and",
    "the structure depends on the value of the nuclear spin .",
    "the scheme in fig .",
    "1 is for nuclear spin 1/2 ( hydrogen ) .",
    "the structure of levels in positronium and muonic atoms is different because some other effects enter into consideration . for positronium ,",
    "an important feature is a real ( into two and three photons ) and virtual ( into one photon ) annihilation .",
    "the former is responsible for the decay of the s - states , while the latter shifts triplet levels ( and 2@xmath19s@xmath20 in particular ) .",
    "the shift is of the order of @xmath21 .",
    "contributions of the same order arise from relativistic effects and hyperfine interactions . as a result",
    "the positronium level structure at @xmath10 has no hierarchy ( fig .",
    "another situation is that for the muonic atoms .",
    "a difference comes from a contribution due to the vacuum polarization effect ( the uehling potential ) .",
    "effects of electronic vacuum polarization shift all levels to the order of @xmath22 .",
    "this shift is a nonrelativistic one and it splits 2s and 2p levels .",
    "the fine and hyperfine structures are of the same form as for the normal atoms ( i. e. @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ) and at low @xmath0 the lamb shift is a dominant correction to the energy levels .",
    "0.03    0.08    a number of different splittings have been precisely studied for about a century . bound state qed and maybe even qed itself was essentially established after a study of the lamb shift and the fine and hyperfine structures in hydrogen , deuterium and helium ions . in the last decades ,",
    "progress with such measurements was quite slow .",
    "the results of the last twenty years are presented in fig 2 ( lamb shift ) and 3 ( fine structure recalculated in terms of the lamb shift ) , while the older experiments are averaged ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for references ) . to reach the lamb shift from the fine structure ( 2p@xmath252s@xmath26 ) measurement we need to use a value of the 2p@xmath252p@xmath26 splitting which was found theoretically .",
    "the most direct results of the lamb shift need no qed theory .",
    "a result claimed to be the most accurate one ( _ sokolov_@xmath3 ) has an uncertainty of about 2 ppm .",
    "it is corrected because of a recalculation of the lifetime of the 2p@xmath26 state @xcite : @xmath27 there is some criticism by e. hinds @xcite and it is not clear if this result is as accurate as claimed . we wish to note , however , that common opinion on the direct lamb shift measurement contains two contradicting statements .",
    "firstly , it is generally believed that a lamb splitting of 2s@xmath26 and 2p@xmath26 ( about 1 ghz ) , with a decay width of 2p being 0.1 ghz , can not be measured better than 10 ppm .",
    "this means that the statistic error should be larger than 10 ppm .",
    "secondly , it is believed that sokolov s experiment is incorrect only because of a possible systematic error claimed by hinds .",
    "however , nobody insists that the statistical treatment of sokolov s data was incorrect and we can hope that traditional methods can go far beyond 10 ppm level .",
    "measurement of the deuterium lamb shift within the sokolov scheme will provide a chance to test some systematics of his experiment .",
    "essential progress in study of the hydrogen lamb shift comes recently from the optical two  photon doppler  free experiments ( see _ hnsch_@xmath3 and _ schwob et al._@xmath3 fort detail ) .",
    "the doppler  free measurement offers a determination of some transition frequency in the gross structure with a accuracy high enough to use the results to find the lamb shift .",
    "however , two problems arise due to these experiments .",
    "0.08    0.08    the transition energy between different levels of the gross structure is mainly determined by the rydberg energy : @xmath28 . to extract the lamb shift we first need to find a value of the rydberg constant .",
    "there are two ways to manage this .",
    "following the first of them one has to measure two different frequencies within one experiment with the ratio of the frequencies being an integer number . obtaining a beat frequency",
    "one can avoid the problem of determining the rydberg constant .",
    "three experiments have been performed in this way : the garching experiment dealt with the 1s2s transition and the 2s4s ( and 4d ) , at yale 1s2s frequency was compared with the one ",
    "photon 2s-4p transition and that was the only precision optical experiment with a one  photon transition .",
    "the recent paris experiment worked with 1s3s and 2s6s ( and 6d ) .",
    "the values derived from these experiments are collected in fig .",
    "4 .    another way to manage the problem with the rydberg constant is to do two independent absolute frequency measurements ( i. e. measurements in respect to the primary cesium standard ) and to compare them afterwards , hence determining both the rydberg constant and the lamb shift . such an approach , combining results from garching ( 1s2s ) and from paris ( on 2s8s , 8d , 12d ) , gave another optical value ( fig .",
    "4 ) . some of the optical experiments were also performed for deuterium and that may improve the accuracy in the determination of the rydberg constant and , thence , of the hydrogen lamb shift",
    ".    however , the values in fig . 4 derived from the optical measurements need further theoretical treatment . the experiments involved a number of levels ( 1s , 2s , 3s etc ) and with optical experimental data there was also a problem of an increasing number of levels with an unknown lamb shifts .",
    "the problem was solved with the help of a specific difference @xcite : @xmath29\\biggr\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and a table for @xmath34 can be found in refs .",
    "the uncertainty was also discussed there .",
    "the difference has a better established status than that for 1s ( or 2s ) lamb shifts ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the uncertainty budget was improved recently after calculations of one  loop corrections , exactly at @xmath1 , ( _ jentschura et al._@xmath3 ) and leading three  loop contributions ( _ melnikov and van ritbergen_@xmath3 ) .",
    "the theory of 2p@xmath252p@xmath26 splitting is also well established .",
    "perhaps , we have to clarify here the word `` theoretical '' .",
    "a value is a _ theoretical _",
    "one if it is sensitive to _ theoretical _ problems ( like the problem of the proton radius and of higher  order qed corrections for the lamb shift ) . an insensitive , sterile value is not theoretical , it is rather a _ mathematical _ one , and that is the case for the difference @xmath35 and the 2p@xmath36 energy .",
    "details of theoretical calculations can be found in the review @xcite .",
    ".theoretical unceratinty of the different corrections for the lamb shift in hydrogen .",
    "@xmath37 in case of recoil term we present a value of contradiction between different calculations .",
    "@xmath38 we give an estimated unceratinty of proper reevaluation of the most accurate data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the three parameters we mention generate different expansions and it is found that all three kind of expansions are not free from problems .    * the qed expansion over @xmath6 is an asymptotic one and the value of terms will decrease to some @xmath39 and increase after it . fortunately",
    ", that is not important for @xmath40 , which are only actual for the bound state qed . *",
    "the @xmath4 expansion involves another problem .",
    "one knows that high @xmath0 is a bad limit ( strong coupling ) and it is believed that low @xmath0 is a good limit .",
    "the latter is wrong .",
    "it is clear that at @xmath41 there is no bound system at all and the behavior of any expansion in the limit of low @xmath0 is not an analytical one .",
    "this eventually leads to logarithmic contributions .",
    "even a cube of logarithm ( @xmath42 at @xmath1 ) appears .",
    "the imaginary part of the logarithm is @xmath43 and the non  leading terms have often large coefficients because of this .",
    "there is another mechanism for large coefficients . as it is well",
    " known the bethe logarithm ( @xmath44 ) is a logarithm of an effective energy ( in atomic units ) of an intermediate state in a calculation of the electron self  energy .",
    "a logarithm equal to 3 corresponds to a quite relativistic intermediate p  state ( @xmath45 ) and that also leads to large coefficients because of relativistic corrections for intermediate states . * the recoil effect with the @xmath46 expansion also involves a non  analytical behavior .",
    "it is correct that the limit @xmath47 ( positronium ) is rather complicated for a calculation , however at the opposite limit ( @xmath48 ) there is no bound state .",
    "hopefully , often the logarithmic recoil corrections are not quite important numerically .",
    "since most of the recoil effects are relativistic ones , the exchange loop generates the effective parameter @xmath49 rather than @xmath4 .    due to the increasing number of logarithmic contributions we end up with a problem of large higher  order corrections .",
    "some higher  order logarithmic terms are compatible in comparison to a constant part of some lower  order terms .",
    "* for the hydrogen 2s lamb shift , non  logarithmic parts of the fifth order corrections ( in unit of the rydberg contributions ) lie from 164 khz ( @xmath50 ) and 37 khz ( @xmath51 ) to a few khz for recoil terms .",
    "the leading logarithmic term in the next order is @xmath52 , which contributs 3.6 khz . * the non  logarithmic parts of the third order correction ( in unit of @xmath53 ) for the ground state muonium hyperfine splitting varies from 8.8 khz ( @xmath54 ) to 2 khz for recoil and radiative recoil terms and to 0.4 khz for @xmath55 .",
    "three leading logarithmic corrections are slightly below 1 khz ( see table 2 ) : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "* a number of positronium levels are under study .",
    "the non - logarithmic @xmath59 term ( 7.2 mhz ) for the hyperfine structure is bigger than the logarithmic part of the @xmath60 contribution ( 0.9 mhz ) , while for the 1s-2s interval the situation is different : the non - logarithmic @xmath59 term is only 0.5 mhz and that is less than 1.2 mhz of the @xmath60 .",
    "these example show that an estimation of the higher order terms is extremely important and we hope that a calculation of leading logarithmic contributions provides a reasonable way to estimate uncalculated terms .",
    "we estimate the non  leading term within a half  value of the leading logarithmic contributions .",
    "estimation of uncalculated terms is a crucial problem in any qed calculations .",
    "let us now mention the case of moderate z. study of these ions provides a unique possibility of measuring higher order corrections .",
    "in particular an experimental study of helium ( _ drake_@xmath3 , _ burrows et al._@xmath3 ) and nitrogen ( _ myers_@xmath3 ) hydrogen  like ions will allow us to extract information on higher  order two  loop contributions with the help of a theoretical study of all other terms ( _ ivanov and karshenboim_@xmath3 ) .",
    "moderate@xmath0 few  electron atoms allow us to test our understanding of higher  order electron  electron interactions which is important for high @xmath0 spectroscopy .",
    "large values of the higher  order terms imply a calculation without expansion .",
    "this is only possible for one parameter , either @xmath4 or @xmath46 . for the simplest corrections ( like e. g. the vacuum polarization )",
    "it is possible to calculate analytically to any order of @xmath61 , otherwise only numerical results are possible .",
    "it is unlikely that a complete exact calculation of the two - loop self - energy can be performed soon and that means that expansion techniques is still the main approach in calculating the higher - order terms , perhaps in combination with experiments .",
    "a new opprortunity appears due to recent measurements of a bound electron @xmath62factor in a hydrogen  like atom ( _ hffner et al._@xmath3 , @xcite ) .",
    "a recent result on the carbon ion is useful for indirect determination of the electron mass ( _ karshenboim_@xmath3 ) .",
    "our theoretical prediction @xmath63 mainly based on @xcite calculation has a smaller uncertainty in part because of taking into account a known @xmath64 term .",
    "studies of the @xmath62factor will be very different from the lamb shift and the hyperfine structure .",
    "in contrast to spectroscopic studies it is possible to go through all @xmath0 and to determine some unknown coefficients of the theoretical expansion if we can fix its shape ( we call this _ weak theory _ in contrast to a real theory which can give direct numerical predictions ) .",
    "concluding the paper we wish to mention briefly different applications for the study of simple atoms .",
    "these studies are important for different field of physics :    * determination of fundamental constants ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) : some of these are important for other application , like e. g. the fine structure constant is necessary to reproduce the value of the ohm from the quantum hall effect . * development of new optical standard and tool for same : like e. g. the new frequency chain designed recently ( see _ diddam et al._@xmath3 , _ udem et al._@xmath3 and @xcite ) . * _ new _ physics : a study of muonium - to - antimuonium conversion ( _ jungmann_@xmath3 ) and the exotic decay of positronium ( _ conti_@xmath3 ) provide a possibility of looking for new particles , while the antihydrogen project and some others are expected to test some symmerties or possible variations of fundamental constants .",
    "* particle physics : a recent study of hydrogen is rather important to learn the proton structure , than to test the bound state qed . the theoretical methods developped recently are of use both for atoms and two - quark particles ( mesons ) and qed is a good opprotunity to test the methods .",
    "exotic atoms give us accurate information on hadron - hadron interactions .",
    "* nuclear physics : the situation is similar to that for particles physics : a study of light atoms offers information on structure of their nuclei .",
    "one the other hand , two and three  body atoms are an appropriate problem to testing different effective methods before to applying them to light nuclei .",
    "most of these questions and a more broad range of problems in physics of simple atoms were considered at a satellite meeting to the icap ( hydrogen atom , 2 : _ precise physics of simple atomic system _ ) .",
    "the proceeding will be published by springer in 2001 .",
    "i am grateful to t. hnsch , k. jungmann , g. werth , j. sapirstein and e. myers for useful and stimulating discussions .",
