    "a few following studies discussed properties of the clump - origin bulge . @xcite argued with numerical simulations that the clump - origin bulges should be classified into classical bulges , since the bulges in their simulations have a density profile near to the @xmath1 law , a thick shape , and a slow rotation in stellar component although the clumps are fast rotating before the bulge formation .",
    "they suggested that initial _",

    "since the original claim of the unphysical fragmentation was done based on their simulations during non - linear evolutions @xcite , it is hard to clarify what was the true origin of the unphysical fragments .",
    "this problem has been first pointed out by @xcite . since their evaluation",
    "was based on their simulation during non - linear evolutions , it is difficult to clarify what was the actual origin of the unphysical fragments .",
    "@xcite showed with well - conceived numerical tests for this problem that the growth of a linear - regime perturbation in a self - gravitating fluid is just slower than that of the analytical solution when the mass resolution is insufficient to express the local jeans mass ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "they did not find any unphysical fragmentation in simulations with insufficient mass resolution .",
    "therefore , there is no need to worry about the unphysical fragmentation in simulations with insufficient mass resolution without temperature / pressure floor .",
    "hence , the result that the disk holds a number of small clumps especially in early phase in our simulation is not a numerical artifact ( see , ",
    "the effect of the insufficient mass resolution in our simulation would appear as the suppression of growth rates of clump seeds",
    ". however , this is not crucial for our results because ( 1 ) the dynamical time of seeds we may drop in our simulation is short because they are compact ( 2 ) the final mass of the clumps are much larger than the resolution limit .",

    "since the system is lacking continuous gas supply supposed in the cosmological context , the gas accretion ceases at @xmath33 .",
    "after the cessation of gas supply , only a small number of tiny clumps form in the disc , which are fragile to tidal force and these disrupted clumps build up a stellar disc .",
    "the other massive clumps can survive , merge with one another and grow to more massive ones . in this phase , a central density slope of the dm halo",

    "@xcite has first suggested a thick disc formation scenario by dynamical heating on a disc by clumps , and @xcite observationally discussed the existence of a thick disc in chain galaxies . @xcite",

    "these bulges have a small value of the srsic index , @xmath95 , despite the fact that their star formation activity is as weak as classical bulges .",
    "these are called ` _ _ inactive pseudobulges _ _ ' @xcite .",
    "although the bulge in our simulation is less active than the observed inactive pseudobulges by @xmath96 in the specific star formation rate ( @xmath97 in the observations ) , the clump - origin bulge in our simulation resembles to the inactive pseudobulges : the nearly exponential surface density and the inactive star formation .",
    "we have to note that it could not be fair to directly compare the bulge in our simulation with the inactive pseudobulges in observations .",
    "the inactivity of these observed pseudobulges may be due to feedback from an active galactic nucleus , while our simulation does not take it into account .",
    "moreover , the simulated galaxy is lacking the later gas accretion which would play an important role for the thin disc formation .",
    "the star formation activity in the clump - origin bulge would be affected by the gas accretion : a dynamically cold thin disc forms non - axisymmetric structures such as spiral arms and a galactic bar , which can supply the bulge with gas more or less and would activate the star formation in the bulge .",
    "we set the larger spin parameter than the mean value of cosmological simulations , @xmath98 , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although observed values among high - redshift galaxies are still controversial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as we mentioned in  3.1.1",
    ", the large spin parameter would lead the formation of a large disc , small clumps and a small bulge .",

    "the disc in our simulation is larger than their observational result by a factor of 2 or 3 and the surface density of inter - clump region is lower than the observed values ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , our simulation may _ not _ be a well - reproduced model of the high - redshift galaxies in the current observations on the points of the disc size and the surface density , although our simulation does not seem inconsistent with the observation of @xcite on the points of the number and mass of the clumps ( compare with @xmath102 in fig.[snap ] ) . in our simulation ,",
    "the mass resolution of gas , which corresponds to the minimum resolved jeans mass , is approximately @xmath103 .",
    "this is much smaller than the mean clump masses observed in @xcite and comparable to the smallest clumps in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mass and number of clumps we obtained in our simulation are do not suffer from the resolution effects .",
    "however , current high - redshift observations still have difficulties of limited angular resolution and detectability , which would have caused underestimates of the number of clumps and the disc diameter . moreover , low luminosity clump clusters might have been missed . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", the current high - redshift observations would be biased to bright parts in bright galaxies .",
    "@xcite discussed that their clump cluster samples have a too high inter - clump surface density to be a typical nearby spiral galaxy like the mw .",
    "although clump clusters with a low surface brightness would not be the most representative cases for the high - redshift clump clusters , it may be possible that the low surface brightness clump clusters had been present but missed in the observations , and may be a progenitor of the nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "our simulation result may corresponds to such a low luminosity clump cluster , which suggests the old and metal - rich pseudobulge formation from the clumps .",
    "the longevity of the clumps in our simulation should be also examined carefully . in our simulation ,",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the main causes of this difference are the disc size and the clamp mass .",
    "the clumps in our simulation have to migrate a long distance to the galactic centre because of the larger disc scale length than that in the previous works .",
    "in addition , the clump masses seem somewhat smaller than these in the previous works .",
    "therefore , the dynamical friction on the clumps is weak in our simulation .",
    "in such a case of the slow evolution with the long - lived clumps , the clump clusters can not finish the formation of disc and bulge in the early universe .",
    "if the evolution time scale is @xmath106 like our simulation , the clumps remain in galaxies until after the redshift @xmath107 .",
    "observationally , there exists clump clusters even after the redshift @xmath107 , and @xcite observed that the clump clusters in the lower - redshift universe are less massive than these in the higher - redshift universe although they discussed that this downsizing is due to a detection limit in the observation and a smaller sampling volume in the lower - redshift universe .",
    "if this downsizing is real , our simulation may correspond to such less massive galaxies evolving slowly until the low - redshift .",
    "disruption of the clumps should be also discussed .",
    "recently , @xcite has observed strong outflows from some clumps , which are faster than the escape velocity of the clump .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the clump disruption due to the superwinds implemented in their numerical simulations by a parametrised wind model , although @xcite had analytically discussed that such a strong feedback would not be realistic .",
    "the sn feedback model adopted in our simulation can not reproduce such destructive superwinds .",
    "@xcite suggested that the most probable engine of the superwinds is radiation pressure from newly formed massive stars .",
    "however , most of simulations for galaxy formation have not been implemented with the radiation pressure from the massive stars and our simulation did not either .",
    "the result of @xcite implies that taking the radiative feedback into account may drastically change the picture of the simulations for clump clusters .",
    "the mw bulge does not follow the properties of classical bulges nor pseudobulges .",
    "the mw bulge shows a nearly exponential profile , an oblate peanut shape ( x - shape ) and a significant rotation , which are similar to pseudobulges . at the same time",
    ", it has old stars , a high metallicity and weak star formation , which are similar to classical bulges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite observationally discussed that an @xmath108 vs. @xmath76 distribution of the mw bulge stars agrees very well with the result of the chemo - dynamical simulation for clump - origin bulge formation in @xcite . on the other hand , contrary to @xcite , the recent observation of baade s window by @xcite showed considerable disagreement in a metallicity distribution function with the simulation result of @xcite",
    ". these chemical abundances will provide further constraints on the bulge formation scenario .",
    "we assumed an idealized simulation model , a collapsing gas sphere in a navarro - frenk - white model halo , in order to study _ naive natures _ of a clump - origin bulge . as we noted repeatedly in previous sections ,",
    "our model would need the later gas accretion to form a thin disc @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the cosmological context , real galaxies suffer galaxy merger more or less .",
    "these physical processes following the clump - origin bulge formation could alter the naive natures of the clump - origin bulge .",
    "for example , as we noted in  3.1.3 , a barred structure may induce a cylindrical rotation of the bulge @xcite .",
    "recently , some observations showed bimodal metallicity distributions and kinematics among mw bulge stars , implying a multiple formation process of the mw bulge @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the mw bulge is a complex bulge of a classical bulge and a pseudobulge .",
    "thus , bulge formation in real galaxies ( including the mw ) might be complex and proceed through multiple scenarios .",
    "some bulges would be a composite structure as proposed by some observations of extra - galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such unclassifiable bulges like the mw bulge ( old pseudobulge ) are also observed in some other disc galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our simulation results suggest that clump - origin bulges could be a possible origin of these old pseudobulges .",
    "in addition , as we discussed in  3.4 , the inactive pseudobulges may be also clump - origin bulges .",
    "it is very difficult to determine whether a bulge observed in a distant disc galaxy is clump - origin or not .",
    "although @xcite has argued that the secular evolution could build some pseudobulges quickly @xmath109 ago , we expect that the secular evolution would not be able to build up a pseudobulge in a premature disc in early phase of the galaxy formation .",
    "it is because the ` _ _ secular _ _",
    "' evolution has to postdate accomplishment of their disc formation and takes a long time to form a pseudobulge .",
    "therefore , we can expect that a galactic bulge observed in the high - redshift universe would be either a classical bulge or a clump - origin bulge . as we showed in  3.1.1",
    ", the clump - origin bulge has a nearly exponential surface density profile , which is distinguishable from the @xmath1 law profile of the classical bulges .",
    "thus , if the density profile of the bulges in clump clusters could be observationally resolved , we would be able to identify the clump - origin bulges by identifying their exponential density profile .",
    "@xcite has observationally indicated that comoving spatial number density of clumpy galaxies ( clump clusters and chain galaxies ) in the high - redshift universe ( @xmath110 ) are consistent with the density of spiral galaxies in the nearby universe and suggested that quite a few galaxies of current spirals used to be a clump cluster or a chain galaxy .",
    "this implies that disc galaxies hosting a clump - origin bulge may not be rare .",
    "however , the idea that all disc galaxies must have formed a clump - origin bulge contradicts the observational fact that the number of bulge - less spiral galaxies is not small @xcite .",
    "as we noted in  4.1 , @xcite had discussed that the observed clump clusters could not be the nearby spiral galaxies because of the too high surface density .",
    "so far , there have been only a few studies discussing the natures of clump - origin bulges .",
    "as we noted in  3.1 , @xcite has argued with numerical simulations that clump - origin bulges have a similar dynamical state to classical bulges , such as a large srsic index , @xmath111 and a slow rotation , @xmath112 .",
    "their results indicating classical bulge - like signatures poses a discrepancy with our results .",
    "this disagreement may imply that the properties of clump - origin bulges depend on initial conditions of simulations .",
    "our simulation model adopted the collapsing gas sphere model , while @xcite used a uniform density disc model as their initial condition .",
    "as we discussed , the size and number of the clumps would depend on the initial spin parameter .",
    "the size of the clumps may affect the relaxation process in the clump mergers .",
    "in the simulations of @xcite , fewer and larger clumps form in the clump cluster and the resultant @xmath59 ratio is somewhat larger than in our simulation .",
    "simulation method may also be a possible cause of the disagreement .",
    "the simulations of @xcite were performed by a particle - mesh sticky - particle code which mimics hydrodynamics by inelastic collisions between particles designated as a gas particle . on the other hand ,",
    "we describe the multi - phase interstellar medium with our sph code which treats radiative cooling , far - ultraviolet heating and sn feedback with hydrodynamical equations of motion .",
    "since the sticky particle method is only an imitation of hydrodynamics , the evolution of the ism represented by the sticky - particle method may lead different from that by the sph method .",
    "the sph simulations have also still suffered from the overcooling problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "degree of dissipation , i.e. richness of gas , in merging clumps may also affect the properties of the clump - origin bulge .",
    "moreover , structure of remnants seems to depend on the equation of state and cooling of gas @xcite .",
    "hence , the contradiction of our results of the clump - origin bulge to that of @xcite may stem from a difference of gaseous physics in the clump merger .",
    "the degree of dissipation in the clump mergers may depend on initial conditions of a simulation model and/or the adopted numerical scheme for hydrodynamics ( the sticky - particle or sph code ) .    as noted above , the clump - origin bulge in our simulation",
    "has nearly twice larger rotation in terms of @xmath113 than the result of @xcite .",
    "recently , the simulations of @xcite and @xcite have also demonstrated that the clumps in clump clusters are dynamically rotation supported systems during the migration toward the galactic centre although they paid little attention to resultant bulges .",
    "especially , @xcite mentioned that clumps which have experienced merger with other clumps tend to be highly supported by rotation and indicated that more massive clumps have larger rotation ( their  4.2 ) .",
    "although @xcite discussed kinematics of gas only , their results imply that the clump merger can spin up the remnant clumps .",
    "therefore , we could expect that the clump - origin bulges in their simulations would have a significant rotation because the clump - origin bulges are the final remnant of the clump mergers .",
    "clump - origin bulges form through ` _ _ mergers of stellar clumps _ _ ' in a disc , whereas classical bulges form through ` _ _ mergers of galaxies _ _ ' .",
    "formation of the clumps are caused by instability of gas in rotating disc , therefore , these clumps retain a memory of their discy origin and a spin in the same direction as the disc rotation as shown by @xcite .",
    "the bulge formation by the clump mergers takes place in the disc plane after orbiting around the galactic centre in the same direction , i.e. ` _ _ prograde - prograde merger _ _ ' . as a result , the clump - origin bulges which are remnant of the clump merger retain the orbital angular momentum of the merger and the spin angular momentum of the progenitor clumps in their kinematics",
    "then , the bulges should acquire the significant rotation of which property is different from that of classical bulges although both of them are built through merger - origin formation scenarios .",
    "our result indicated the nearly exponential surface density profile with the srsic index of @xmath53 .",
    "we speculate that this exponential profile may stem from the elongated bar - like shape of the bulge in our simulation ( fig .",
    "[ bulge_zoom ] ) .",
    "it has been observed that barred structures in spiral galaxies have an exponential density profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this was demonstrated also using numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we summarize the natures of the clump - origin bulge in our simulation :    * nearly exponential surface density profile , * elongated bar - like structure , and boxy shape , * significant net rotation , but not cylindrical , * old stellar population , * high metallicity of stars with vertical gradient and * inactive star formation ( if there is no late accretion ) .",
    "if we compare these natures with those observed in typical classical bulge and pseudobulges @xcite , the former three natures , exponential profile , boxy shape and a significant rotation , indicate pseudobulge - like signatures .",
    "on the other hand , the latter three , old , metal - rich stars and weak star formation , represent classical bulge - like signatures .",
    "therefore , the clump - origin bulge , which we obtained here , can not be simply classified into classical bulges nor pseudobulges , but should have unique properties as shown in this paper .",
    "however , @xcite has suggested with numerical simulations that clump - origin bulges should be a classical bulge .",
    "this inconsistency would be due to adopting different initial conditions and/or numerical schemes . as we discussed in  3.1.1 and 4 , initial setup in simulations would control disc diameters , gas density in the disc and the size of clump - origin bulges finally , and may affect the natures of the clump - origin bulge .    hence , our results open up a different possibility of clump - origin bulges than the result of @xcite . in our simulation ,",
    "the surface density of the disc is lower and the resultant bulge is smaller than @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that low surface brightness clump clusters prefer a _ clump - origin pseudobulge _ and enable the galaxy to avoid the _ clump - origin classical bulge _ formation .",
    "the clump - origin pseudobulge is more applicable to the mw bulge which is a pseudobulge - like but old metal - rich bulge .",
    "the low surface brightness clump clusters might had been present but missed in the observations and @xcite discussed that clump clusters in their observation have a too high surface density to be the mw progenitor .",
    "thus , to investigate the clump - origin bulge formation and its natures may take an important role to seek the formation history of the mw .",
