    "indeed , various investigations took into account the possible contribution of higher derivatives terms in the bulk action and mainly in the case of one bulk coordinate @xcite .",

    "the space time metric is defined in more than five dimensions , but , still , the gravity part of the action is assumed to be the einstein - hilbert term possibly supplemented by a bulk cosmological constant .",
    "we would like to understand if it is possible to obtain warped solutions in the context of the gravitating abelian - higgs model in six dimensions when quadratic curvature corrections are present .",

    "the quadratic corrections to the einstein - hilbert action will be taken in the euler - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) form .",
    "this choice has the interesting property of preserving the relations among the string tensions derived in the case when the gravity action is in the einstein - hilbert form .",
    "previous studies suggest that if the einstein hilbert action is supplemented by quadratic curvature corrections , geometries leading to warped compactification in more than five dimensions can be obtained .",

    "if this is the case , the quadratic part of the action can be written in terms of the euler - gauss - bonnet combination : @xmath0 in four dimensions the egb is a topological term and it coincides with the euler invariant : its contribution to the equations of motion can be rearranged in a perfect four - divergence which does not contribute to the classical equations of motion . in more than four dimensions",

    ", new regular solutions can be found if @xmath46 stays on the curves intercepting the `` parabola '' lying , in its turn , on the @xmath171 plane .    from a practical point of view",
    "the various curves intercepting the `` parabola '' have been obtained in the following way .",
    "starting from the point on the `` parabola '' , @xmath47 was held constant , @xmath46 was varied by small steps and @xmath66 was tuned so that the relation @xmath172 stays satisfied .",
    "the possibility of finding these regular solutions means that the parameter space is wider in the case when @xmath126 than in the case when @xmath105 .",
    "the same kind of analysis can be numerically performed starting from any point lying on the `` parabola '' and the five curves reported are only illustrative .",
    "as previously stressed , the curves intercepting the `` parabola '' can not be extended to arbitrary large values of @xmath100 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath51 and @xmath100 , from eqs .",
    "( [ as1])([as2 ] ) we must have that @xmath173 in order to avoid imaginary warp factors .    in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] also positive values of @xmath47 have been included . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "expoenentially decreasing solutions for the warp factors are not possible if @xmath47",
    ". moreover , also in the case @xmath104 exponentially decreasing warp factors are not allowed .",
    "the part of the curve corresponding to @xmath174 leads , for @xmath104 to exponentially _ increasing _ warp factors , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the border point between the regions @xmath175 and @xmath49 of the parameter space is represented by the bogomolnyi point where @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath121 @xcite .    in the case",
    "when quadratic curvature corrections are absent the parameter space of the model is three - dimensional and it can be described with a three dimensional plot as in fig .",
    "( [ f5 ] ) .",
    "if quadratic curvature corrections are present the parameter space is four - dimensional and it has to be studied , necessarily , one of the four parameters . in the present discussion",
    "@xmath67 has been fixed .",
    "however , the same study can be repeated by fixing either @xmath47 or @xmath66 and by discussing , respectively , the picture of the parameter space in the ( @xmath67 , @xmath66 , @xmath46 ) or ( @xmath67 , @xmath47 , @xmath46 ) planes .",
    "in this paper the solutions of the gravitating abelian - higgs model in six - dimensions have been studied .",
    "provided the quadratic corrections are parametrized in the egb form , new classes of regular solutions leading to warped geometries have been found .",
    "the rationale for these results stems from the fact that the relations among the string tensions still exist even if curvature self - interactions are present . in its turn , this property , relies , ultimately , on the features of the egb combination which does not produce , in the equations of motion , derivatives higher than second .",
    "if the bulk cosmological constant is negative the results of adding the egb term in the bulk action can be viewed in two different perspectives .",
    "starting from a regular solution ( without quadratic corrections ) , new solutions ( still regular ) can be found in the vicinity of the initial solution by changing @xmath178 from @xmath91 to @xmath48 . if , in another perspective , we start from a singular solutions ( without quadratic corrections ) new ( regular ) solutions can be found by tuning appropriately the value of @xmath46 .",
    "the results obtained in this investigation show that vortex - like solutions , obtained using the einstein - hilbert action , are stable towards the introduction of quadratic corrections of the egb form .",
    "furthermore , our results suggest that in the parameter space of the regular solutions a new direction opens up when @xmath126 .",
    "the singularity - free solutions discussed in the present paper represent an ideal framework in order to check for the localization of the various modes of the geometry as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the presence of an ( abelian ) gauge field background makes these solutions also rather interesting from the point of view of fermion localization @xcite .",
    "these problems are left for future studies .",
    "the authors are deeply indebted to m. shaposhnikov for inspiring discussions and important comments . the support of the tomalla foundation is also acknowledged ."
