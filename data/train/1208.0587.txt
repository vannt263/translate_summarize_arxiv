    "the link between chemical and dynamical evolution in early - type galaxies ( hereafter etgs ) has been studied for quite a long time through systematic measurements of colour gradients , which may lead us to understanding how the variations in the age and metallicity of the underlying stellar populations evolve as star formation proceeds through the history of the system @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models suggest that metallicity and age gradients arise naturally from the processes leading to galaxy formation , like in the `` in - situ '' collapse of a proto - galactic gas cloud @xcite . the first rendition of this formation scenario , also known as monolithic collapse @xcite , predicted steep metallicity gradients , while , a revised monolithic model for the formation of etgs led to shallower metallicity gradients ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that galaxy mergers will weaken the metallicity gradient , and lead to significant levels of star formation in the galaxy centre .",
    "more recently , cosmological simulations have brought to our attention the importance of cold accretion , as a viable way to form galaxies `` in - situ '' , resembling the monolithic formation scenario  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is still a matter of debate whether the metallicity gradient we measure today is a product of an old stellar population  reflecting mainly the initial conditions when the system collapsed  or results from more recent star formation episodes .",
    "therefore , systematic measurements of colour gradients are of crucial importance to distinguish among different formation models of early - type systems . a proper constraint on the gradients of the properties of the underlying stellar populations will help understand the mass assembly process in etgs .",
    "in the past , spectroscopic indices were used to measure metallicity in etgs , revealing the existence of radial gradients ranging from @xmath40.1 to @xmath40.3  dex per decade @xcite .",
    "the number of etgs for which the radial dependence of age and metallicity extends beyond one effective radius is small for today standards , albeit growing .",
    "this is due to the difficulty in obtaining spectroscopic measurements at surface brightness below the background sky level .",
    "however , the availability of multi - waveband samples for a vast number of sources remedy this situation , allowing us to estimate colour gradients up to several effective radii at low to moderate redshifts @xcite , and open the possibility of studying radial gradients at z@xmath51 @xcite .",
    "an important caveat is that colours have to be modelled by a stellar population synthesis code .",
    "this approach has been used in the past for small samples of etgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in the recent years , the study of large galaxy samples has mostly focused on the optical regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where one has to contend with the age - metallicity - extinction degeneracy @xcite .",
    "@xcite , and more recently  @xcite , have found evidence for significant age gradients in ellipticals , while independent works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , found negligible age gradients , showing that the interpretation of colour gradients is a difficult task .",
    "another aspect of studying colour gradients in etgs is to understand how this quantity relates to other observables and relationships so that we can build up a consistent galaxy formation and evolution framework .",
    "for instance , although etgs obey specific scaling relations ( e.g. fundamental plane ) , they may well represent different families according to the way mass was assembled during their history and the characterization of how mergers may have established the mass assembly is of unquestionable interest ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . as a first approximation",
    ", we would expect mergers to significantly affect the well - known scaling relations involving central velocity dispersion and stellar population properties , unless mass is accreted at very large radii .",
    "theoretical and observational work has shown that the presence of tidal debris in the outskirts of etgs may provide an essential piece of evidence to distinguish among different assembly scenarios ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "so far , most of the stellar population work was carried out within the central regions and mainly restricted to the optical regime .",
    "extending the analysis to the outer regions with a combination of optical and near - infrared data is a key factor to better comprehend how galaxies form and assemble their baryons .     in this paper",
    "we combine optical ( sloan digital sky survey  data release 6 , sdss ",
    "dr6 ;  @xcite ) and near - infrared ( ukirt infrared deep sky survey  data release 4 , ukidss - dr4 ; @xcite ) data to study colour gradients in a sample of 674 etgs located in different environments .",
    "the data were analysed with a dedicated pipeline that uses the package 2dphot @xcite .",
    "the high quality image of both optical and nir surveys enabled us to determine reliable colour gradients out to eight effective radii , as shown below .",
    "all systematic effects were carefully taken into account , including background subtraction ; stacking of the colour profiles and the effect of the tails of the psfs in the redder bands , all of which are crucial for an accurate measurement of the colours in the outer regions .",
    "the results presented here confirm previous findings about the metallicity gradients , and show that age gradients may not be as negligible as some papers have reported in the past .",
