    "using photometric redshifts to estimate the distances of faint galaxies has become an integral part of galaxy surveys conducted during recent years .",
    "this is driven by the large number of galaxies , and their faint fluxes which have made spectroscopic follow - up infeasible except for a relatively small and bright fraction of the galaxy population .",
    "albeit less precise and less accurate than spectroscopy , photometric redshifts provide a way to estimate distances for galaxies too faint for spectroscopy or samples too large to be practical for complete spectroscopic coverage . since the early description of using colors to determine distances in baum ( 1962 ) , and the important developments over the years described in e.g. , koo ( 1985 ) , connolly et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and gwyn ( 1995 ) , the number of articles describing the method and the number of applications for photometric redshifts have grown rapidly .",
    "the photometric redshift technique is usually divided into two groups , template fitting and empirical fitting .",
    "the template fitting technique derives the photometric redshift by minimizing the value @xmath1  when comparing an observed sed with the sed computed from a template library that includes spectral - energy distributions for a variety of galaxy types ( representing different redshifts , star - formation histories , chemical abundance , and mixtures of dust and stars ) .",
    "the empirical technique uses a training set of galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts to derive a relation between observed photometry and redshifts .",
    "today , a large number of codes of both techniques exists , many of which are publicly available .",
    "codes based on the template fitting technique include : zphot ( giallongo et al .",
    "1998 ) , hyperz ( bolzonella et al . 2000 ) , bpz ( bentez 2000 ) , impz ( babbedge et al . 2004 ) , zebra ( feldmann et al . 2006 ) , spoc ( finlator et al . 2007 ) , eazy ( brammer et al .",

    "2010 ) ; `` empirical-@xmath1 '' ( wolf 2009 ) ; `` random forests '' ( carliles et al .",
    "certain codes combine the methodology of both techniques ( e.g. , eazy , goodz , and lephare ) which can use a training set of galaxies to derive corrections to zero - points and/or template sed shapes in order to minimize the scatter between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in the training sample .",

    ", the catalogs will include auxiliary information such as photometric redshifts and stellar masses of galaxies .",
    "the candels data include some of the deepest photometry available in both optical and infrared over a wide area and it is important to investigate the behavior of the derived quantities at the faint flux levels typical of the survey .",
    "therefore , the candels team has preformed a series of tests to evaluate how photometric redshift and mass estimates from different codes compare , how well codes reproduce the redshift of objects with spectroscopic redshifts , how well codes reproduce masses from simulated galaxies , and how photometric redshift estimates depend on signal - to - noise , redshift and galaxy color .",
    "furthermore , we investigate how the error estimates determined by the codes compare with the errors expected from either spectroscopic control samples or simulated galaxy catalogs .",
    "finally , we investigate possible ways of combining results from individual codes in order to improve the quality of the photometric redshifts .",
    "while the investigation was performed with the candels data in mind , the questions should be general and the results relevant for any survey targeting distant galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we focus the investigation on the photometric redshift technique .",
    "a number of collaborators in the candels team were asked to use their preferred photometric redshift code to derive redshifts for a set of photometric catalogs .",
    "the results from the different codes and sets of template seds were thereafter compared with the aim of deriving the best photometric redshifts possible given the available data set and to minimize possible biases in the derived redshifts . in an accompanying paper ,",

    "( 2013 , in preparation ) , we discuss estimates of stellar masses using the same catalogs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the catalogs used in the testing followed in section 3 by a presentation of the different codes used .",

    "2011 ) , while f105w covers most of the remaining @xmath1060% , therefore , 13 band photometry is the maximum for any individual object .",
    "photometry in the acs and wfc3 bands are measured using sextractor in dual - image mode with f160w as the detection band . for all other bands ,",
    "the tfit method was used .",
    "this results in a flux measurement for all objects in all bands that cover the footprint of the f160w data .",
    "both sextractor and tfit will provide flux estimates for sources based on prior information on position and shape from the h - band image .",
    "therefore fluxes are provided in every band even for sources that are not formally detected in that band .",
    "these fluxes can sometimes be negative due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "if the photometric error estimates are corrected , this should not cause problems for the photometric - redshift estimates .",
    "we also note that the f160w band photometry includes 4 of the 10 planned epochs of goods - s data available at the time of the test . a detailed description of the candles goods - s data is given in guo et al .",

    "there are two quantities that together determine how well a code works , the rms after excluding outliers and the fraction of outliers .",
    "the tables show that most codes produce results that broadly agree .",
    "the scatter after excluding outliers is typically in the range @xmath66  and the outlier fraction ( olf ) is within the range 0.04 - 0.07 for a majority of the codes .",
    "codes with low @xmath50  tend to have a low olf . comparing the scatter @xmath50  using the fixed outlier definition with",
    "the scatter @xmath53 ( which uses the dynamic outlier definition ) , shows a very similar rank between methods ; codes with small @xmath50  have small @xmath53  and codes with high @xmath50  also have high @xmath53 .",
    "the outlier fraction is naturally less correlated between the methods . by definition ,",
    "codes with @xmath67  will get a lower dynamic outlier fraction , olf@xmath55 , compared to the fixed outlier fraction olf and vice versa .",
    "due to the similarity in both the size and rank between the results of the two definitions , we will quote results using @xmath50 and olf as default , but will also include results from the dynamic definition .",
    "the fixed definition allows for comparisons between results and the literature .    in overall performance , there are five codes that have a combination of both low scatter and outlier fraction for both catalogs , i.e. , codes 3b , 6e , 7c , 11h , and 13c .",
    "inspecting table [ table1 ] , reveals that these five results represent four different photometric redshift codes and four different sets of template seds .",
    "the result that no particular code gives a significantly better results than others is not surprising since most codes , including the four resulting in the lowest scatter , are based on the same technique , the @xmath1  template fitting .",
    "maybe a bit more surprising is that four ( or almost five ) different sed sets are represented , indicating that there is not a preferred set .",
    "we note that all five codes use the training sample of galaxies to derive zero - point shifts and/or corrections to the template sed set used .",
    "furthermore , all five include templates with emission lines and perform additional smoothing of the given flux errors .",
    "this suggests that having a code with these options is important for the quality of derived photometric redshifts . finally , all these codes use template seds that include emission lines features , suggesting their importance when deriving photometric redshifts .    at the other end of the spectrum , there are a few codes with an elevated fractions of outliers compared to the other codes . for the @xmath5-band",
    "selected sample ( table [ table2 ] ) , codes 2a , 5d , and 8f have a slightly higher outlier fraction . for code",
    "5d , this should mainly be due to the lack of templates matching low luminosity galaxies .",
    "this drives the outlier fraction to high values .",
    "furthermore , it also prevents the code from converging for many fits , resulting in derived photo - z for only a fraction of the objects in the catalog ( about 30 % lack a calculated photo - z ) . for the other two codes",
    ", the higher outlier fractions could be due to a combination of not adding smoothing errors , lack of training ( i.e. , deriving zero - point offsets ) , or a limited parameter space for constructing the template sed sets .",
    "there are two codes , 5d and 8f with a resulting scatter @xmath68 in the h - band selected catalog and @xmath69 in the z - band selected catalog . for code 5d ,",
    "the mass limit on the template seds used in this investigation should be the driving factor behind the high scatter . we also note that neither code 5d or code 8f use the spectroscopic training sample to optimize results .    for the three participants that use the eazy code ,",
    "the spread in results is comparable to the other codes that also use traditional @xmath1  fitting .",
    "the scatter should be due to the differences in templates , training of the code , and priors used between the participants running eazy , which are the main parameters that vary between any @xmath1  fitting code , as discussed in section 3 .    from the descriptions of the different codes in section 3 ,",
    "it is clear that there are many different approaches for treating data points with negative fluxes . for the spectroscopic training sample ,",
    "the galaxies are relatively bright and there are few data points that are `` non - detections '' with negative fluxes ( @xmath101% ) .",
    "therefore , the different treatment of negative fluxes will likely not introduce any extra scatter or biases between codes . at finter limits",
    "though , this may lead to systematic differences between the output of the codes .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] and [ table3 ] , we also list the scatter between the photometric redshifts and spectroscopic redshifts where we adopt the median photometric redshift from all codes and the median from the five codes with the lowest scatter .",
    "it is very interesting that taking the median in this way produces a lower scatter and outlier fraction than any of the individual codes .",
    "this important result is discussed in section 5 , where we investigate different approches of combining results to improve the photometric redshift accuracy .    to illustrate how well the individual codes recover the redshifts of the spectroscopic sample ,",

    ", we highlight the five codes that produce the lowest scatter and outlier fraction ( i.e. , are located closest to the origin ) .",
    "besides the individual results , we also plot the median photometric redshift of all codes ( black star symbol ) and the median of the five codes with the smallest scatter ( red star symbol ) .",
    "this illustrates that taking the median decreases both the scatter and fraction of outliers .    in figure [ fig4 ] , we plot the mean bias for the different codes , as well as for the median of all codes and the five selected codes .",
    "we find most codes produce photometric redshifts that are slightly shifted by mean[@xmath57@xmath100.01 in a sense that the photometric redshifts predict higher redshifts compared to the spectroscopic sample .",
    "calculating the error in the mean as @xmath72 , where @xmath73  is the number of data points , we find typical errors in the mean of @xmath100.002 .",
    "therefore , all codes have biases inconsistent with zero at a @xmath383@xmath42  level .",
    "however , the biases are smaller than the scatter ( @xmath50 ) and will not dominate the overall uncertainties in the photometric redshifts .      including nir data when deriving photometric redshifts",
    "is important for photometric redshift accuracy and limiting outliers ( e.g. , hogg et al . 1998 ; rudnick et al . 2001 ; dahlen et al . 2008 , 2010 ) . therefore ,",
    "having a catalog selected in the nir should in principle be better than an optically selected catalog since the former assures the availability of nir data . of course",
    ", having an optically selected catalog that requires nir coverage should be as close to equivalent to an nir selected .",
    "if we compare the results from the wfc3 @xmath5-band selected catalog ( table [ table2 ] ) with the acs @xmath6-band selected catalog ( table [ table3 ] ) , we find that the scatter is similar for each code .",
    "this is not unexpected since most of the photometry in the two cases are based on the same images , only the nir bands differ . in more detail ,",
    "the scatter for 9 of the 11 codes and the outlier fraction for 7 of the 11 codes are lower in the @xmath5-band selected catalog compared to the @xmath6-band selected .",
    "this slight improvement is consistent with the expected better performance for a nir selected catalog combined with the extra depth and number of bands when replacing isaac @xmath13  and @xmath5  by wfc3 f098m / f105w , f125w and f160w .",
    "the bias@xmath56  shows similar trends in the two catalogs , with deviations that are statistically inconsistent with being zero , but the absolute values are small compared to the scatter , @xmath50 .",
    "since the candels survey is foremost an infrared survey for which planned catalogs are to be selected in the wfc3 infrared bands , we will concentrate our investigation on the @xmath5-band selected galaxy sample .",
    "it is important to note that the photometric redshift accuracy reported for any survey may not be representative of the actual sample of galaxies for which photometric redshifts are derived .",
    "the reason being that the scatter is calculated using a subsample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that in most cases are significantly brighter , and in many cases at lower redshift , compared to the full galaxy sample . since fainter galaxies have larger photometric errors and may be detected in fewer bands , we expect that the errors on the photometric redshifts increase for these objects ( e.g. , hildebrandt et al .",
    "2008 ) . as an example of the magnitude and redshift dependence on the photometric redshifts , ilbert et al .",
    "( 2009 ) report for the cosmos survey @xmath65=0.007 and olf=0.7%  for a sample of galaxies at redshift @xmath74  brighter than @xmath7522.5 . at fainter magnitudes and higher redshift ,",
    "they report @xmath65=0.054 and olf=20%  for galaxies with redshift @xmath76  brighter than @xmath7725 , illustrating the significance of this effect .",
    "to quantify the magnitude dependence of the photometric redshifts , we divide the spectroscopic sample from the @xmath5-band selected catalog into two magnitude bins with equal number of objects , one brighter and one fainter than @xmath78=22.3 .",
    "we find that the scatter in the median photometric redshift increases from @xmath50=0.027 to @xmath50=0.034 and the outlier fraction decreases from 3.1% to 2.7% when going from the bright to the faint subsample .",
    "the difference is small , reflecting the relative brightness of both subsamples . as a comparison",
    ", we find the that faint spectroscopic subsample has a median @xmath78=23.2 , significantly brighter than the median magnitude of the full sample , which is @xmath78=25.7 .    to visualize the behavior of photometric redshifts down to faint magnitudes , we plot in figure [ fig5 ] the scatter between the eleven individual codes and the median of all codes .",
    "each panel shows about @xmath106000 objects with signal - to - noise @xmath7910 .",
    "we do not know how well the median represents the true redshifts at these magnitudes , but the plot illustrates that there are some substantial biases in a number of codes .",
    "for example , codes 2a , 5d , and 8f have a fairly prominent population at higher redshift compared to the median . potentially due to the aliasing between the lyman and the 4000  breaks these codes more often chose the higher redshift solution compared to the median .",
    "again , we note that the median we compare to is not necessarily the most correct solution .    to check the magnitude dependence for the full galaxy sample in some more detail , we plot in figure [ fig6 ] , the comparison between the five codes with the lowest scatter ( 3b , 6e , 7c , 11h , and 13c ) and the median of all codes in three magnitude bins , @xmath8024 , 24@xmath8126 , and 26@xmath8128 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the scatter increases at fainter magnitudes ( note that we plot the same number of objects , @xmath103000 , in each panel ) . to quantify the magnitude dependence",

    "this increase in scatter , and particularly in the fraction of outliers , further illustrates that the dispersion in the photometric redshifts calculated by different codes becomes significant at faint magnitudes , even though a good agreement is noticeable at brighter magnitudes .",
    "interestingly though , there is a fairly good agreement between code at all magnitudes at redshifts @xmath823 - 4 .",
    "this should be due to the strong lyman - break feature at these redshifts that helps determine the photometric redshift .",
    "we select these five particular codes because at bright magnitudes ( i.e. , typical of the spectroscopic samples ) they produce very similar photometric redshifts .",
    "this allows us to investigate how results diverge between codes due to mainly the signal - to - noise .",
    "we made similar tests using different codes and find results that are consistent .      to quantify the difference between the brightness distribution of the sub - sample with spectroscopic redshifts , compared to a full galaxy sample , we plot in figure [ fig7 ] the normalized distributions of the available spectroscopic sample together with the full sample of galaxies for the goods - s @xmath5-band selected catalog .",
    "for the full sample , we restrict the selection to galaxies with s / n@xmath795 in the @xmath5-band that are detected in at least six photometric bands .",
    "the red line in the figure shows the distribution of the spectroscopic sample while the blue line shows the full sample . obviously , the spectroscopic sample is significantly brighter than the bulk of the full sample of galaxies .",
    "when using the s / n@xmath795 limit in the @xmath5-band , we find that the full sample is on average 3.6 mag fainter than the spectroscopic sub sample .    to better quantify how the brightness of the spectroscopic sample affects the photometric redshift accuracy ,",
    "we artificially make the spectroscopic sample fainter to resemble the flux distribution expected for a deeper spectroscopic sample .",
    "first , we make a catalog consisting of the @xmath10 1000 objects with highest quality spectroscopic redshifts from the @xmath5-band selected catalog .",
    "the catalog initially has a magnitude distribution according to the red line in figure [ fig7 ] .",

    "we assign a photometric error drawn from the original catalog at a flux level matching the new assigned flux .",
    "we finally perturb the flux values using the assigned errors , assuming that they are gaussian and represent 1@xmath42 . the new magnitude distribution of the shifted spectroscopic sample is shown by the gray line in figure [ fig7 ] .",

    "we illustrate results from one specific code ( code 3b ) , but we expect a similar behavior for all codes .",
    "it is clear that both the scatter and outlier fractions increase as the spectroscopic sample is shifted to fainter flux levels .",
    "particularly , there is a significant increase in outlier fraction at faint magnitudes @xmath84 .",
    "this could be related to the increased risk of misidentifying the lyman and 4000  breaks at fainter magnitudes where photometric error are larger .    in a second test using the shifted photometry of the spectroscopic sample , we compare the results from multiple codes run on the same catalog .",
    "here we use the @xmath15m=3.6 catalog , since this illustrates the difference in photometry between the spectroscopic catalog and the full @xmath5-band selected catalog used in this investigation .",
    "eight codes participated in this test ( codes 3b , 4c , 6e , 7c , 8f , 9 g , 11h , and 12i ) .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "black dots to the lower left show the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction for the original case , while red dots in the upper left show the results after shifting the catalog to fainter fluxes and increased errors .",
    "star symbols represent the results when using the median of all codes . obviously , both the scatter and outlier fraction increase significantly for all codes when the photometric errors increase . for the median case ,",
    "the scatter approximately doubles from @xmath50=0.03 to @xmath50=0.06 , while the outlier fraction increases from 4% to 15% . at the same time",
    ", we note that in the case with shifted photometry , the median produces better results than any of the individual codes .    as a final test ,",
    "we use data from the simulated catalogs that were made artificially fainter to investigate the reliability of the photometric redshifts as a function of magnitude , using one of the codes ( code 3b ) , as a representative case . in figure [ fig10 ]",
    "we show the scatter ( @xmath50 ) and outlier fraction in magnitude bins with @xmath85  over the range @xmath86 .",
    "the figure indicates that both the scatter and outlier fractions are reasonably well behaved and degrade slowly out to magnitudes @xmath87 , whereafter both quantities increase more rapidly at @xmath88 .      to test the redshift dependence of the photometric redshifts ,",
    "we first divide the spectroscopic control sample in the @xmath5-band into two bins with equal number of objects .",
    "the redshift dividing the bins is @xmath71=0.95 and the median redshift for the two bins are @xmath71=0.7 and @xmath71=1.4 , respectively .",
    "we find that the scatter in the median photometric redshift increases from @xmath50=0.027 to @xmath50=0.034 , while the outlier fraction decreases from 3.4% to 2.4% when going from the low redshift to the high redshift subsamples .",
    "this indicates that there is no strong redshift trend in the photometric redshift accuracy . to make a more detailed investigation",
    ", we divide the spectroscopic sample into eleven redshift bins and calculate the scatter and outlier fraction in each bin separately .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the result for the @xmath5-band selected catalog when comparing the median photometric redshifts to the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the scatter , @xmath50 , lies at a fairly constant level with redshift , indicating that the redshift - normalized scatter gives a fairly robust indicator of the photometric redshift accuracy almost independent of redshift .",
    "the only point that lies significantly above the trend is the @xmath892 point .",
    "this could be due to the lack of strong spectral features at this redshift .",
    "this is also the redshift range where we expect the spectroscopic redshifts to be most uncertain and we can not rule out some errors in the spectroscopic sample even though we limit our selection to the highest quality spectra . at higher redshifts , the lyman break moves into the @xmath0-band , providing an important signal for the photometric redshift determination ( e.g. , rafelski et al .",
    "we also note that the vimos @xmath0-band used is redder than the typical @xmath0-band and therefore starts to probe the break at slightly higher redshifts . possibly contributing to the relatively high outlier fractions in the @xmath892.5 and @xmath893.2 data points .",
    "however , the tests do not account for high - z galaxies with significantly different seds than the moderate - z spec sample .",
    "if such a population is common at high redshift and is unrepresented in the template sed libraries , it could affect the accuracy of the photometric redshifts .",
    "it is , however , reassuring that for the spectroscopic sample at @xmath90 , the photometric redshifts agree well with the redshift from the spectra ( e.g. , figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "contributing to the accuracy of the @xmath91 photometric redshifts is the break due to absorption by intergalactic hi clouds ( madau 1995 ) , which affects the observed signal for all galaxy sed types .",
    "in fact , in figure [ fig11 ] , there are no outliers in the highest redshift bin ( @xmath92 ) , indicating that the lyman break helps to provide robust photometric redshift determinations at these redshifts .      the most important spectral features for determining photometric redshifts are the lyman break at @xmath10 1215  and the 4000  break ( we let the 4000  break denote the overall spectral feature caused by the balmer break at 3646  and the accumulation of absorption lines of mainly ionized metals around @xmath104000 ) .",
    "it is also expected that the size of the break should be important for the accuracy of the photometric redshifts .",
    "for example , an old red galaxy with a pronounced 4000  break should result in more accurate photometric redshift compared to a younger blue galaxy with a more featureless sed .",
    "these effects should be most important at lower redshifts ( @xmath93 ) , where the redshifted lyman break has not yet entered the observed @xmath0-band . at higher redshifts",
    "where the break at rest frame wavelengths short of @xmath101215    ( madau 1995 ) moves into the observed bands , even intrinsically featureless blue galaxies will show a break feature that helps determine the photometric redshift .",
    "galaxies with blue , relatively featureless sed at redshift @xmath93  therefore have the highest risk of being assigned incorrect redshifts .    to investigate the photometric redshift accuracy as a function of galaxy spectral type , we divide our spectroscopic sample into early - types , late - types , and starbursts based on the rest frame @xmath94  color of the galaxy .",
    "the colors are calculated using the observed bands that most closely covers the redshifted rest frame @xmath94  together with k - corrections based on the best - fitting template sed following the method in dahlen et al .",
    "we use a division where galaxies with @xmath95  are assigned as starbursts and galaxies with @xmath96  are assigned as early - type galaxies . galaxies with intermediate colors",
    "are assigned as late - type galaxies .",
    "this is a single rest frame color definition , we can not rule out that dusty later type galaxies may fall into the early - type category . in figure",
    "[ fig12 ] , we plot the scatter and outlier fraction for the control sample in six color bins using the median photometric redshift when comparing to the spectroscopic redshift .    from the figure we note",
    "that the scatter is not strongly dependent on galaxy color .",
    "there is an indication that the early - types have a smaller scatter ( @xmath970.02 ) compared to the remaining types ( @xmath970.03 ) .",
    "however , within the starburst and late - type bins , there is no clear color dependence .",
    "if we exclude galaxies at @xmath98  ( where the lyman break may be useful for determining photometric redshifts ) there is no significant change in the results .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is no strong color dependence in the photometric redshifts , except that we may expect more secure redshifts for early - type galaxies .",
    "the five codes resulting in the lowest scatter and outlier fraction use the spectroscopic training sample to derive shifts to either the photometry or template seds and add extra smoothing errors .",
    "the better behavior when applying zero - points shifts could be due to a number of factors",
    ". there could be actual errors in the given zero - points used to calculate the photometry , there could also be a mismatch between the template seds and the true seds of the observed objects .",

    "there are two main factors affecting the derived @xmath1  values , p(z ) distributions , and widths of the derived 68% and 95% intervals .",

    "this could result in seemingly acceptable fits over a larger redshift range and therefore a broad p(z ) distribution and an overestimate of the confidence intervals .",
    "a difference between the codes compared here is that some have added extra smoothing errors to existing photometric errors ( codes shown in table [ table1 ] ) . adding extra errors",
    "will effectively work as a smoothing of the p(z ) distributions and result in relatively larger numbers in table [ table5 ] compared to what the original photometric errors would result in .",
    "for example , codes 3b and 12i , which have the largest fractions quoted , are among the codes adding the largest smoothing errors to the existing photometric errors . secondly , the completeness of the template sed set used affects derived @xmath1  values and associated p(z ) distributions . utilizing a coarse set of templates that does not sufficiently cover the true sed distribution ,",
    "may result in acceptable @xmath1  value from only at a very narrow range of redshifts .",
    "this could lead to a narrow probability distribution and an underestimate of the confidence intervals . in table",
    "[ table5 ] , the small values for code 5d is likely due to a relatively coarse grid of template seds . therefore ,",
    "even if the photometric redshifts agree well with the spectroscopic control sample , one should be cautious when using the errors for photometric redshifts if these are based on the results from the @xmath1  fitting . in section 5.2 , we describe a simple method for adjusting the quoted errors so that they better reflect the actual uncertainty suggested by the spectroscopic control sample .",
    "table [ table2 ] shows that the outlier fraction for the @xmath5-band selected catalog lies in the range @xmath104 - 15% , depending on code .",
    "when comparing only the five codes with the lowest scatter , the range of outliers is narrowed to 3.6 - 5.3% . in absolute numbers ,",
    "this corresponds to 21 - 31 objects per code of the total 589 objects in the spectroscopic control sample .",
    "the number of individual objects flagged as an outlier by at least one of the five codes is 48 . of these ,",
    "20 are flagged by one code only , 7 by two codes , 2 by three codes , 8 by four codes , and 11 by all five codes .",

    "are flagged as outliers in 4 and 5 codes , respectively .",
    "the fact that 18 outliers are flagged by at least 4 of the 5 codes indicates that some feature drives the photometric redshift to an outlier independent of code or template sed used .",
    "these objects may have an sed not represented by any of the template sed sets .",
    "otherwise , the spectroscopic redshift could be incorrect or there could be problems with the photometry . to investigate this ,",
    "we look closer at the spectra for the subsample of 18 objects flagged as outliers by the median method . we find that at least 12 objects have spectroscopic redshifts that most likely are not the highest quality and could therefore be wrong .",
    "there are objects with spectra measured by different groups that disagree .",
    "a few of the objects also have close companions ( within @xmath101 arcsec ) where it is difficult to determine if the correct object in the photometric catalog has been assigned the spectroscopic redshift .",
    "so it is possible that the actual outlier fraction for the combined median photometric redshift is significantly less than reported in table [ table2 ] and table [ table3 ] , perhaps as low as @xmath101% when using the median method .",
    "we have shown that combining results from multiple codes leads to photometric redshifts with lower scatter and outlier fraction than any individual code .",
    "this important result implies that using a combination of outputs from multiple algorithms can significantly improve the quality of photometric redshifts .",
    "the fact that the median outperforms any individual method indicates that net systematic errors must go in opposite directions amongst different codes , such that the middle value will have smaller scatter about the true redshift than even the best single technique .",
    "we expect systematic errors to vary due to differences in the templates used , priors applied , or fitting algorithms employed . in effect , there is a wisdom of crowds in combining results from different photometric redshift codes , much like can occur when combining multiple estimates of quantities in other fields ( surowiecki 2005 ) .    besides deriving accurate photometric redshifts , we are also interested in assigning proper errors to derived photometric redshifts . in this section ,",
    "we look more in detail into these issues by investigating different ways of combining data when we have results derived independently by different participants . for this particular investigation",
    ", we use results from codes number 3b , 6e , 7c , 11h , and 13c . for each code",
    ", we have the calculated photometric redshift and the full redshift probability distribution , p(z ) , tabulated in the range @xmath109  in steps of @xmath110 .",
    "different codes use different recipes for assigning the photometric redshift based on the p(z ) . either the highest peak can be used to determine the photometric redshift , or some kind of weighted photometric redshift",
    "can be derived by integrating over the probability distribution . to get a clean comparison between methods",
    ", we use below photometric redshifts based on both the peak of the p(z ) , i.e. , @xmath111 , as well as the weighted photometric redshift , @xmath112 , and compare results separately .",
    "we compute the latter by integrating over the main peak of the p(z ) distribution",
    ". we do not want to integrate over the full p(z ) distribution since there are cases with multiple peaks due to e.g. , the aliasing between the lyman and the 4000  breaks ( where the actual p(z ) could be basically zero at the reported photometric redshift if it falls between two peaks ) .",
    "as already shown above , if we compare the median photometric redshift from multiple codes for each individual object with the spectroscopic control sample , we get a scatter and an outlier fraction lower than any individual code . the resulting scatter and outlier fraction from the straight median is shown in the first two rows of table [ table6 ] .",
    "these results indicate that combining results from multiple codes is advantageous .",
    "however , using a strict median does not directly produce any useful photometric redshift error estimate .",
    "basing the errors on the scatter between the five codes will not yield a consistent measurement because of the expected highly non - gaussian shape of the photometric redshift p(z ) and the strong possibility that the various photometric redshift estimates are covariant with each other ( e.g. , they are based on the same photometry ) , so their scatter will not reflect all measurement uncertainties .",
    "we therefore look into a few more ways of combining data that may provide accurate results for both the photometric redshifts and the errors . there is no significant difference between using @xmath111  compared to @xmath112 .      as a second approach",
    "we add the full p(z)@xmath113  distributions from the different codes to produce a combined p(z ) . from table",
    "[ table5 ] we saw that a number of codes underestimate the errors , i.e. , the distributions are too peaked around the derived photometric redshift .",
    "this will bias the combined redshift towards the values given by codes that underestimate the errors . at the same time",
    ", the photometric redshift of codes that overestimate the error will be given lower weights .",
    "to alleviate this , for codes underestimating the errors , we smooth each p(z)@xmath113  using a simple recipe where we for each redshift bin @xmath17  replace the probability with a combination of three adjacent bins p(z@xmath114)@xmath113=0.25p(z@xmath115)@xmath113 + 0.5p(z@xmath114)@xmath113 + 0.25p(z@xmath116)@xmath113 . we recalculate the fraction of the spectroscopic sample inside the 68.3% interval and iterate this procedure until the correct fraction is recovered .",
    "we thereafter apply the same smoothing , individually calculated for each code , to the full sample of galaxies . for the codes that overestimate the errors",
    ", we instead use a simple model to sharpen the p(z)@xmath113 . for each code",

    "to illustrate this procedure , we show in figure [ fig14 ] an example applied to a galaxy with spectroscopic redshift @xmath6=0.734 .",
    "the five blue lines show the probability distributions for five individual codes ( codes 3b , 6e , 7c , 11h , and 13c ) . to account for the four codes underestimating the error intervals and one code overestimating them",
    ", we apply the smoothing and sharpening described above .",
    "this should lead to distributions with more consistent confidence intervals .",
    "the resulting individual distributions are shown with red curves in the figure . in this particular case ,",
    "there is one code that produces a p(z ) with a double peak , which turns into a single peak after smoothing . after adding the five individual distributions , the resultant distribution is shown with the black line .    in table",
    "[ table6 ] , we show the results from adding the probability distributions in rows three and four .",
    "compared to the straight median , the combined p(z ) results in slightly higher outlier fraction and @xmath64 , but similar @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , either method should result in photometric redshifts with no significant difference in accuracy .",
    "the advantage with the added p(z)@xmath113  method is that it provides an estimate of the full probability distribution , which could be used to calculate e.g. , 68.3% confidence intervals . to test how well the combined p(z ) distributions",
    "reflects the true errors , we repeat the exercise above and calculate the fraction of objects in the control sample that falls within the 68.3% interval of the combined p(z ) . we find that 85% of the spectroscopically determined redshifts fall within the 68.3% confidence intervals .",
    "this suggests that combining the p(z ) by adding the individual distributions overestimates the size of the 68.3% confidence intervals . to get a distribution that better represent the errors ,",

    "for example , if the measurement is bad , one could use a redshift probability following the volume element redshift dependence . using this assumption , we find that the outlier fraction slightly decreases ( from  3.4% to  3.1% ) , while the full rms show a marginal increase ( @xmath64=0.10 to @xmath64=0.11 ) and ( after excluding outliers ) the rms , @xmath50 , remains unchanged .",
    "since we do not expect the spectroscopic control sample to follow the distribution of the volume element , we do not expect this example necessarily reflects the true expected effect of the volume element assumption .",
    "a further refinement of the model would be to assume that the redshift distribution of a bad measurement follows the expectations of an assumed luminosity function combined with a magnitude limit appropriate for this particular survey .",
    "in addition , it should be possible to let the expected distribution be dependent on , e.g. , apparent magnitude or color .    instead of using a generic form for u(z ) ,",
    "another possibility is to dilate the given p(z ) and use this for u(z ) . in this case",
    "we assume that the errors are underestimated if the measurement is bad , rather than having no information .",
    "there are many possibilities when applying the hierarchical bayesian method as discussed in lang & hogg ( 2012 ) .",

    "over the years , there has been a number of investigations comparing results from different codes in order to assess the accuracy of and the consistency between different photometric redshift codes .",
    "this includes hogg et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , abdalla et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and hildebrandt et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "the most comprehensive previous investigation of photometric redshift methods conducted in a similar way to what presented here is described in hildebrandt et al ( 2010 ) . in that investigation ,",
    "the result of twelve different runs , representing eleven codes , are presented . of these codes , three are common to this investigation ( eazy , lephare , and hyperz ) .",
    "photometric redshifts are calculated using an @xmath134-filter selected 18-band photometry catalog covering the goods - north field .",
    "the wavelength range covered is the same as here , i.e. , u - band to the irac 8.0@xmath33 m channel .",
    "the spectroscopic sample includes @xmath102000 objects , of which one quarter was provided as a training sample .",
    "the overall scatter after excluding outliers lies in the range @xmath50=0.04 - 0.08 , with a median of the twelve runs of @xmath50=0.059 .",
    "this is slightly higher than the median found here @xmath50=0.046 ( using the @xmath6-band selected results in table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "more importantly , the outlier fraction in hildebrandt et al . lies in the range 8 - 31% and has a median of 18.5% , while our investigation reports outlier fractions 4 - 14% with a median 6.4% .",
    "this significant difference , despite the many similarities in setup , could be due to a number a reasons .",
    "we have here used a uniformly produced photometry over the whole wavelength range using the tfit method , while hildebrandt et al . used coordinate matching between three different data sets ( ground - based optical / nir , @xmath2/acs , and @xmath9/irac ) .",
    "this could introduce biases in the photometry due to blending , mismatches and differences in apertures used .",
    "furthermore , we have made an effort to include only the highest quality spectroscopic redshifts and have excluded all known x - ray and radio sources when compiling our training and control samples .",
    "this should assure us an unbiased estimate of the scatter and outlier fractions when comparing spectroscopic and photometric redshifts . at the same time , hildebrandt et al .",
    "reports that at least some of the high outlier fraction could be due to x - ray sources or the spectroscopic sample used .",
    "we therefore think that the outlier fractions of a few per cent found in our study should be more representative of what is achievable with photometric redshifts when using deep high quality photometry .",
    "we have used the candels goods - s @xmath2  wfc3 @xmath5-band and acs @xmath6-band selected catalogs containing uniform tfit photometry covering the @xmath0-band to irac infrared bands to investigate the behavior of photometric redshifts . using a control sample with high quality spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "we have compared photometric redshifts derived from a number of different codes .",
    "we have investigated how the accuracy of the photometric redshifts depends on code and template sed set used .",
    "we have also investigated the dependence on redshift , galaxy color and brightness . finally , we discussed combining results from multiple codes for improving the photometric redshifts and deriving reliable error estimates .",
    "our main conclusions are    * there is no particular code or template sed set that produces significantly better photometric redshifts compared to others .",
    "however , the codes that produce the best photometric redshifts all include training using a spectroscopic sample to calculate offsets or shifts to either the photometric zero - points or the template seds .",
    "* there is a strong magnitude dependence on the accuracy of the photometric redshifts : rms values calculated for a spectroscopic control sample are only valid at the magnitudes probed by that sample .",
    "the photometric redshift uncertainty is likely to be significantly larger for a catalog that is deeper than the spectroscopic subsample .",
    "* we investigated the redshift dependence of the scatter between photometric redshifts and a control sample of spectroscopic redshifts and find that the rms , when normalized to redshift by @xmath42=rms@xmath135 $ ] , is almost independent of redshift .",
    "on the other hand , the fraction of outliers is elevated in the range @xmath136 , possibly due to the relatively weak lyman break signal in the lower part of this range , as well as aliasing between the lyman and the 4000  breaks .",
    "the outlier fraction at high redshift ( @xmath92 ) is low due to the strong lyman break signal .",
    "* we find that the rms is only weakly dependent on galaxy color as measured by the rest frame @xmath94  color . only for the very reddest early - type galaxies",
    "is there an indication that the scatter is smaller than the rest of the galaxy population .",
    "there is no increase in scatter for the most blue galaxies that should have the smallest 4000  breaks . *",
    "the bias@xmath56  between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts , defined as mean[@xmath137 after excluding outliers is statistically inconsistent with zero at a significance of @xmath138 .",
    "however , the bias is always smaller than the scatter and the latter therefore dominates the total uncertainty . *",
    "the photometric redshift codes produce an estimate of the uncertainty in the derived photometric redshift either as a full redshift probability distribution , p(z ) , or as quoted confidence intervals corresponding to e.g. , 68.3% or 95,4% confidence intervals . using the spectroscopic control sample with known redshifts , we calculate which fraction of the galaxies falls inside the 68.3% or 95.4% confidence intervals for the different codes .",
    "we find that a majority of the codes produce confidence intervals that are too narrow compared to expectations , i.e. , the errors in the photometric redshifts are most often underestimated .",
    "factors contributing to the narrow distributions could be underestimated photometric errors or too coarse set of template seds .",
    "we describe a method for adjusting probability distributions so that the correct fraction of galaxies in the control sample falls inside a specified confidence interval .",
    "* we can derive photo - z with lower scatter and outlier fraction when we combine results from different codes , when compared to any single code .",
    "taking a straight median , using a sum of the individual probability distributions , or using a hierarchical bayesian method yields very similar results .",
    "the two latter methods produce a probability distribution that can be used to assign errors to the photometric redshifts . for our spectroscopic sample",
    ", we find an rms of @xmath139  with an outlier fraction of at most @xmath103% .",
    "we finally note that the photometric redshifts presented here are based on test catalogs derived from a subset of candels goods - s data .",
    "after including additional data , particularly the full depth @xmath2/wfc3 @xmath13- and @xmath5-bands , we expect further improvements in the absolute values of the photometric redshift accuracies .",
    "further improvements are possible by the addition of medium and narrow band data that are available for the candels fields . the candels goods - s photometric redshift catalog will be made publicly available and is described in t. dahlen et al .",
