    "starting with the work of @xcite , it has been appreciated that the technique of localisation provides a powerful tool for performing exact non - perturbative computations in supersymmetric field theories defined on curved manifolds . while @xcite computed the exact path integral of four - dimensional @xmath5 gauge theories on a round four - sphere ,",
    "later the attention shifted to three - dimensional theories .",
    "the authors of references @xcite computed the partition function of general @xmath5 superconformal gauge theories , with chern ",
    "simons terms and matter in arbitrary representations , placed on the round three - sphere .",
    "if the theory has an r - symmetry , then it is possible to define it on more general manifolds , while preserving supersymmetry , by turning on a background non - dynamical gauge field coupled to the r - symmetry current  @xcite .",
    "the first examples of such backgrounds were considered in @xcite , where the exact partition function of supersymmetric gauge theories defined on different squashed three - spheres was computed .",
    "it was later shown in @xcite that the `` ellipsoid '' partition function of @xcite extends to a very general class of supersymmetric three - dimensional geometries .",
    "an asymptotically locally ads ( alads ) supergravity solution dual to the construction of @xcite was presented in @xcite , and various extensions were obtained in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will start exploring the gauge / gravity duality for four - dimensional @xmath2 superconformal field theories defined on curved manifolds , with the aim of comparing gravity calculations with exact field theory results .",
    "this problem in four ( boundary ) dimensions turns out to be more complicated than in one dimension lower for different reasons .",
    "when the new minimal or conformal supergravity formulations of rigid supersymmetry are used , unbroken supersymmetry in euclidean signature implies that the field theory must be defined on a hermitian manifold @xcite . however , exact calculations of the path integral using localisation in field theories on such manifolds have been less developed than their three - dimensional analogues so far ( but see the recent @xcite )",
    ". moreover , in four dimensions the path integral generically has logarithmic divergences , and extracting physical information from its finite part is more subtle than in three dimensions due to a number of ambiguities .",
    "these issues are under better control if one considers supersymmetric manifolds with topology @xmath6 . in these cases the path integral with periodic boundary conditions",
    "is expected to be proportional to a supersymmetric index  @xcite , refined with fugacities related to a choice of complex structure on @xmath6 @xcite . for superconformal theories , the index",
    "may be equivalently defined as the generating function of operators weighted by their fermion number , so that the contributions from the long multiplets cancel out , and as shown in  @xcite this may be obtained by putting the theory on @xmath7 . in  @xcite the superconformal index",
    "was successfully compared with the spectrum of kaluza ",
    "klein modes dual to the protected operators being counted by the index . however , from the perspective of the euclidean path integral , it is more natural to compare the field theory partition function with the holographically renormalised supergravity on - shell action @xcite . in the large @xmath8 limit",
    "the index scales like @xmath9 @xcite , while the on - shell action scales like @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , it would appear that the latter can not capture new information about the field theory , apart from the weyl anomaly @xcite . when the field theory is placed on a round ( i.e.  conformally flat ) @xmath3 ,",
    "the gravity dual is simply global ads@xmath0 with euclideanized time , and the renormalised gravity action has been argued to reproduce the _ casimir energy _ of the field theory super yang  mills , and the casimir energy can be computed at weak coupling . ] on @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "more generally , the on - shell action is expected to capture the ratio between the path integral and the index , which has been dubbed `` index casimir energy '' in references @xcite .",
    "this quantity is sensitive to the regularisation of the path integral , and will be discussed in more detail towards the end of the paper .    on the gravity side ,",
    "constructing five - dimensional supersymmetric alads solutions is technically more difficult than obtaining analogous solutions in one dimension less .",
    "one reason is that in odd dimensions the asymptotic form of the fields ( in a fefferman ",
    "graham coordinate system @xcite ) contains logarithmic terms , suggesting that analytic solutions are much harder to find .",
    "@xcite presented an alads solution that is special in this regard , as the logarithmic terms do not arise .",
    "this solution has a conformal boundary with the topology of @xmath12 , however its isometry group is @xmath13 , with the non - compact time being generated by a null ( in the boundary ) killing vector , hence it is not possible to analytically continue it to euclidean signature , while keeping a real metric .",
    "although in order to compare with localisation results we are ultimately interested in euclidean conformal boundaries , we will start working with minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity in lorentzian signature .",
    "this will allow us to construct a supersymmetric solution utilising the formalism of @xcite , thus avoiding complications arising in euclidean signature , where we would have to deal with a complex graviphoton field from the outset .",
    "the solution that we will present is a one - parameter family of supersymmetric deformations of ads@xmath0 , whose conformal boundary includes a biaxially squashed three - sphere with @xmath4 symmetry , as well as a non - trivial gauge field .",
    "it preserves two of the eight supercharges of minimal gauged supergravity .",
    "globally , the space - time is equivalent to ads@xmath0 , with topology @xmath14 , where the first factor is a time direction , and the @xmath15 factor arises from the three - sphere of the boundary smoothly shrinking to zero size in the interior . in particular , the space - time does not have a horizon .",
    "the metric , gauge field , and killing spinor of the solution restricted to the asymptotic boundary reduce precisely to a background @xcite solving the charged conformal killing spinor equation  @xcite , as well as the new minimal version of rigid supersymmetry in curved space  @xcite .",
    "therefore we interpret our solution as the gravity dual to an @xmath2 superconformal gauge theory on a curved , non conformally - flat , background preserving two supercharges .",
    "another feature of this background is that the aforementioned logarithmic divergences do not appear in the partition function  @xcite .",
    "our five - dimensional solution can be uplifted either to type iib or to eleven - dimensional supergravity , with the specific dual field theory depending on the choice of internal manifold  @xmath16 . in the uplift to type iib supergravity @xcite , @xmath16 can be a sasaki  einstein five - manifold , as well as a more general manifold arising from the classification of  @xcite . in the uplift to eleven - dimensional supergravity  @xcite",
    ", @xmath16 can be any of the manifolds in the classification of  @xcite .",
    "a main feature of the solution is that although it has been constructed using a combination of perturbative and numerical analysis , all the quantities of physical interest , namely the on - shell action and the holographic conserved charges , have been obtained analytically as a function of the boundary squashing parameter . upon a simple wick rotation , and compactification of the euclidean time ,",
    "the boundary metric describes a squashed @xmath3 , and the background gauge field becomes complex , consistently with the results of @xcite . while the boundary metric remains real , in the bulk both the gauge field and the metric become _",
    "complex_. however , the renormalised on - shell action is real and we show that it reduces to a boundary term .",
    "moreover , it receives a crucial contribution from the chern  simons term , with the result depending on the gauge choice for the graviphoton .",
    "we will explain that demanding the killing spinors ( on the boundary as well as in the bulk ) to be invariant with respect to a specific choice of killing vector @xmath17 generating time translations , fixes the gauge uniquely .",
    "this is necessary in order to have well - defined spinors after performing the wick rotation , and on the field theory side it is required for defining the euclidean path integral with supersymmetric boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we will show that the holographic charges obey relations consistent with the rigid supersymmetry algebras of the field theories defined on the boundary geometry .",
    "moreover , in the euclidean setting , we will see that the renormalised on - shell action reproduces a suitably defined casimir energy , arising from the supersymmetric path integral , up to terms that we will propose to be removable by a choice of finite local counterterms .",
    "in particular , the casimir energy depends linearly on the complex structure modulus @xmath18 of the boundary manifold and the @xmath19 anomaly coefficient , while we will show that there exists a choice of finite local counterterms , constructed from the supergravity fields and the complex structure , which cancels the remainder terms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section [ susysec ]",
    "we review the derivation of the relevant ode stemming from supersymmetry , following @xcite . in section [ newsol_section ]",
    "we present our new solution , combining analytical methods and a numerical integration of the ode .",
    "section  [ holorensection ] is devoted to holographic renormalisation and the computation of conserved charges . in section  [ summarysol ]",
    "we summarize the main features of the solution . in section [ fielddisc ]",
    "we discuss key properties of the dual field theories , and compare these with the gravity results .",
    "section  [ disc ] concludes summarising our findings and outlining directions for future work .",
    "two appendices contain technical details on the solution and the holographic quantities .",
    "we begin by presenting the supersymmetry equations of minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity , adopting the formalism of @xcite . in particular , we will be interested in supersymmetric solutions of the time - like class , derived from an ansatz possessing ( locally ) @xmath20 symmetry .",
    "this leads precisely to the same equations obeyed by the supersymmetric black hole solutions found in @xcite , and in this section we will follow closely the derivation therein . in the next section , we will present a new solution to these equations .",
    "the reader familiar with eq .",
    "below , or not interested in its derivation , can safely skip to the next section .    in the conventions of @xcite , the action for the bosonic sector of minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity reads",

    "the graviphoton @xmath25 is an abelian gauge field with field strength @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 is the five - dimensional newton constant and @xmath28 is a parameter with dimensions of length , related to the cosmological constant .",
    "the equations of motion derived from ( [ sugraction ] ) read [ einsteineq ] r _ + 2 f_f^_+ g _ ( + f_f^ ) & = & 0 , + [ maxwelleq ] * f + f f & = & 0 .",
    "for most of this paper we will work in lorentzian signature @xmath29 , although we will also discuss an analytic continuation later .",
    "a solution is supersymmetric if there is a non - trivial dirac spinor @xmath30 satisfying the equation [ killingspeqdirac ] = 0 , where @xmath31 generate the clifford algebra cliff@xmath32 , so @xmath33 .",
    "any such solution uplifts ( locally ) to a supersymmetric solution of type iib supergravity  @xcite or of eleven - dimensional supergravity  @xcite .",
    "although global aspects of this uplift can be subtle @xcite , for the solution that we will discuss the gauge field @xmath25 will be a _ globally defined _ one - form on the five - dimensional space , and therefore there are no global obstructions to uplifting it to ten or eleven dimensions .",
    "reference @xcite showed that solutions to ( [ killingspeqdirac ] ) possess a killing vector @xmath34 ( constructed as bilinear in the spinor @xmath30 ) , and fall into two classes , depending on whether this is everywhere null , or timelike at least in some open set .",
    "we will focus on the timelike class , which is further specified by a khler metric @xmath35 on the four - dimensional `` base '' @xmath36 transverse to @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in coordinates such that @xmath37 , the five - dimensional metric takes the form s^2 = - f^2 ( y + ) ^2 + f^-1s^2_b , [ generalggmetric ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are a positive function and a transverse one - form , respectively .",
    "the base is characterized by a khler form @xmath40 , inducing a complex structure @xmath41 , and a complex two - form @xmath42 , which is @xmath43 with respect to the complex structure and satisfies , where @xmath44 is the ricci one - form potential .",
    "namely , given the ricci curvature two - form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the riemann tensor of the khler metric , the ricci potential is defined by @xmath47 .",
    "equivalently , splitting @xmath42 into its real and imaginary parts as , we have a triplet of real two - forms @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "choosing @xmath50 as orientation on @xmath36 , the @xmath51 are anti - self - dual : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the hodge star on @xmath36 .",
    "also satisfy the algebraic relations . here",
    "@xmath54 denote tangent space indices on the khler base . ]    the gauge field of a supersymmetric solution in the timelike class is specified by the geometry and reads [ gaugefieldgg ] f  =  .",
    "moreover , denoting by @xmath55 the ricci scalar of @xmath35 and introducing @xmath56 , supersymmetry also implies that [ relfr ] f^-1  =  - r_b , and g^+  =  - ( r - x^1 ) [ g+istracelessricci ] , while @xmath57 may be determined using the maxwell equation . , where @xmath58 is also defined in  @xcite . in the specific case of interest for us , this is automatically satisfied . ] for more details we refer to @xcite .",
    "similarly to  @xcite , we will consider the following @xmath59 symmetric ansatz for the metric s^2_b  =  ^2 + a^2()(_1 ^",

    "the hat on @xmath67 ( and the consequent one on the left - invariant one - forms ) serves to distinguish this coordinate from a new one , @xmath68 , that will be introduced later . while at this stage @xmath67 should be regarded just as a local coordinate , @xmath68 will be an actual euler angle on  @xmath11 .",
    "the main motivation for working with this ansatz is that the supersymmetry equations reduce to a system of ode s , which ultimately can be expressed as a single sixth - order ode for one function @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in alads solutions , @xmath63 is related ( but , as we will see , not identical ) to a fefferman ",
    "graham coordinate .",
    "the boundary geometry will necessarily have locally @xmath69 isometry , therefore supersymmetry implies that the asymptotic metric and gauge field ( see section [ uvanalysis ] for their expression ) must be that of the example in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "we fix the orientation on @xmath36 defining @xmath70 , while the five - dimensional orientation is given by @xmath71 . the @xmath59 invariant ansatz is completed by taking x^1 & = & - a^2 ( ) _ 1 _ 2 + b ( ) _ 3 , + [ 1 mm ] & = & a()(_1 + _ 2)(+ b()_3 ) , + [ 1 mm ] & = & ( ) _ 3 , + [ 1 mm ] p & = & p ( ) _ 3 , where the function @xmath72 is chosen positive .",
    "the gauge field   becomes [ gaugefieldgr ] f  =   .",
    "the khler conditions then imply that @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath63 , while eq .",

    ", one can solve for @xmath75 in terms of @xmath76 , [ exprpsigeneral ]  =  - ( ^2 f^-1 + 8 ^-2 f^-2 - + f^-1 g ) , and eventually derive the equation governing @xmath76  @xcite : [ sixthordereq ] ( ^2 f^-1 + 8 ^-2f^-2 - + f^-1 g )  +  =  0 , where @xmath77 is the laplacian on @xmath36 .",
    "after using the expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath78 given above , one obtains a non - linear , sixth - order equation for @xmath72 with no explicit dependence on  @xmath63 .",
    "any solution to eq .   gives a supersymmetric solution to minimal five - dimensional gauged supergravity , preserving at least one quarter of the supersymmetry , namely two real supercharges . in  @xcite",

    "we will impose different conditions , in particular we will require that in the interior the space closes off smoothly like @xmath82 , where the first factor is a time coordinate , precisely as in global ads@xmath0 .",
    "another key difference with respect to the solution of @xcite is that the latter is asymptotically ads , with a conformally flat boundary @xmath83 , while our solution will be asymptotically _ locally _ ads , with a non conformally flat boundary comprising a squashed @xmath11 .",
    "correspondingly , while the gauge field strength in @xcite vanishes asymptotically , in our case it will remain non - trivial at the  boundary .",
    "in this section we study solutions to the sixth - order equation  .",
    "we start by obtaining a general asymptotic solution satisfying the alads condition .",
    "then we analyse the equation at finite @xmath63 and impose that the solution closes off smoothly in the interior .",
    "this will give a new one - parameter family of solutions .",
    "we will show that a solution connecting the asymptotic and the interior regions exists both by presenting a linearised solution around the ads@xmath0 background and by providing numerical evidence .",

    ", we introduce new coordinates @xmath98 that will prove particularly natural from a boundary perspective .",
    "these are given by [ changepsi ]  =  - t , y  =  t. then the five - dimensional metric takes the asymptotic form [ asymptoticmetric ] s^2  =  ^2 + e^2 s^2_bdry+  , with boundary metric [ bdrymetric ] s^2_bdry  =   ( 2a_0)^2 , while the gauge field reads [ asymptotica ] a  =  a_bdry + o(e^- ) , with boundary value [ bdrya ] a_bdry  =   . here",

    "we take @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , so that @xmath106 are euler angles on @xmath11 .",
    "then from   we see that the boundary is a direct product geometry including a squashed  @xmath11 , with radius @xmath107 and squashing parameter @xmath108 .",
    "namely , if we regard @xmath11 as a hopf fibration over @xmath109 , we have that the radius of the @xmath110 fiber generated by @xmath111 is rescaled with respect to the @xmath109 radius @xmath107 by a factor of @xmath108 .",
    "we will denote this squashed three - sphere by @xmath112 .",
    "so in these coordinates the boundary metric describes a direct product @xmath113 ; this will allow us to perform a simple wick - rotation later on by just analytically continuing @xmath114 .",
    "note that we need @xmath115 in order to have a riemannian metric on @xmath11 and avoid closed timelike curves in the boundary .",
    "when @xmath116 , then @xmath117 and there is no squashing ; namely , @xmath118 becomes conformally flat and describes an @xmath119 boundary with a round @xmath11 of radius @xmath107 .",
    "correspondingly , all @xmath120 terms in   vanish in this case",
    ". however , these terms are crucial for our purposes , as we are interested in non conformally flat boundaries .",
    "the only other free parameter of the uv solution   appearing in the leading order expression of the supergravity fields is @xmath91 , which controls the overall size of the boundary .",
    "since equation   has no explicit dependence on  @xmath63 , we could set @xmath91 to any chosen non - zero value by performing a constant shift of @xmath63 , followed by a redefinition of the other parameters in  .",

    "we see that a gauge shift @xmath121 just transforms the supersymmetry parameter as @xmath122 . in  , , we chose the gauge by imposing @xmath123 and that the @xmath20 symmetry is respected ; then we fixed the residual freedom to shift @xmath25 by a term proportional to @xmath124 by imposing that the spinor @xmath30 is _ independent of the time coordinate _ @xmath114 .",
    "this last property will be very important for us in the following .",

    ", we also show that the five - dimensional spacetime is alads by recasting the five - dimensional fields in fefferman  graham form .",
    "having determined the asymptotic behavior of the solution at large @xmath63 , we should now study how this ends in the interior ( i.e.  the `` ir region '' ) .",
    "we will require that the spacetime shrinks smoothly to zero size , with no horizon being formed . by exploiting the freedom to shift @xmath63",
    ", we can assume with no loss of generality that this happens at @xmath129 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath72 can be expanded in a taylor series around @xmath130 as [ iransatz ] a ( )  =  a_0^ir + a_1^ir + a_2^ir ^2 + a_3^ir ^3 +  .",

    "this is compatible with the presence of a horizon , because @xmath38 is the norm of the killing vector @xmath34 , and this should become null at the horizon .",

    "we can thus identify the free parameters with @xmath509 and @xmath510 , which are arbitrary because @xmath91 and @xmath511 are . as expected from general considerations about solutions on alads backgrounds",

    "the regularity condition imposed in the ir will constrain these vevs so that no freedom is left once the sources are fixed .    the gauge field in the new radial variable @xmath518 is a  =  t + _ 3 + ( r^-3 ) , with a_t^(0 ) & = & , a_t^(2 ) = 0 , + a_t^(2 ) & = & , + [ 2 mm ] a_^(0 ) & = & -c , a_^(2 ) = , + [ 2 mm ] a_^(2 ) & = & .",
    "because of supersymmetry , the solution for the gauge field does not contain any additional free parameter with respect to the metric .",
    "we have thus proved that the uv solution can be put in fefferman ",
    "graham form .",
    "we can also check that our findings agree with general results on alads backgrounds .",
    "for instance , an asymptotic analysis of the five - dimensional einstein equations in the presence of a cosmological constant  @xcite and a maxwell field  @xcite shows that the first subleading component of the metric is determined as [ g(2)general ] g_ij^(2 )  =  - ( r_ij - r g^(0)_ij ) , while the trace of @xmath506 is fixed by [ traceg(4)general ] tr g_(4 )  =   g_(2)^2 + f_(0)^2 . here",
    ", @xmath237 is the ricci tensor of @xmath519 , @xmath21 its curvature and the indices are raised using @xmath505 . and @xmath520.[comparisontaylor ] ] the traceless part of @xmath506 is instead not constrained by the einstein equation .",
    "we checked that these conditions are indeed satisfied by our solution .",
    "in the following we give the explicit expressions for the holographically renormalised energy - momentum tensor and r - current of our family of solutions .",
    "these are computed using   and  , and turn out to depend on the uv parameters @xmath91 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath191 .",
    "however , we know that the full solution only has one independent parameter . in the main text we showed how one can eliminate two of them : @xmath127 is determined by the global smoothness of the solution as discussed in section  [ sec : globalconstraint ] , while @xmath128 is fixed by a ward identity as explained in section  [ sec : holocharges ] .",
    "we find that their explicit expressions are a_4 & = & ( 5 + 64 a_2 - 256 a_2 ^ 2 + 32 c- 160 a_2 c- 104 c^2 ) , + [ 2 mm ] a_6 & = & [ sola6 ] .",

[ allthestress ] it is easy to check that @xmath263 is covariantly conserved and traceless with respect to the boundary metric  .",
    "the renormalised electric current , corresponding to the dual field theory r - current , reads j  =   and is covariantly conserved with respect to the boundary metric .",
    "we can verify that evaluating the associated charges via the definitions in section  [ sec : holocharges ] gives the results presented in the main text . recall that @xmath521 , and that the volume form on the three - sphere at the boundary is ( s^3_bdry )  =  ^3a_0 ^ 3 v _",

    "these are indeed the expressions appearing in the main text .",
    "consider the standard finite counterterms   for the on - shell action .",
    "these lead to the following ambiguity in the holographic energy - momentum tensor [ ambiguitytij ] t_ij  =   -  =   , where we used the fact that the metric variation of the euler density vanishes identically in four dimensions .",
    "the tensor @xmath525 is given by h_ij = - ^4 x r^2 = 2 _ i _ j r - 2 h_ij r + 12 h_ij r^2 - 2 r r_ij , while @xmath266 is the bach tensor following from the variation of the weyl square term : [ bachtensor ] b_ij & = & - ^4 x c_ijklc^ijkl + [ 2 mm ] & = & 13_i_j r - r_ij + 16 h_ij r - 2 r _ ikjlr^kl + 23 r r_ij + 12 h_ij ( r_klr^kl - 13 r^2 ) .these can also be deduced from the expressions given in  @xcite , after adapting them to @xmath526 signature and to the curvature tensor conventions in our footnote  [ footnoteconventionscurvature ] .",
    "both @xmath525 and @xmath266 are covariantly conserved , and @xmath527 .    including the new counterterm   also affects the energy - momentum tensor , as ^4 x h r_klr^kl  =  2 r_ik r_j^k - h_ijr_kl r^kl + 2 _ l_k ( r_i^k _ j^l ) , where the variation is done at fixed @xmath470 .",
    "specializing these formulae to our background , one can check that the ambiguities in the energy - momentum tensor affect the energy @xmath289 but not the angular momentum @xmath290 .",
    "specifically , @xmath289 is shifted by the same amount as the on - shell action @xmath528 , in such a way that both relations   and   continue to hold .",
    "finally , we note that there is also an ambiguity in the r - current : the variation of the counterterms   with respect to the boundary gauge field @xmath529 yields @xmath530 .",
    "however , this does not modify the temporal component of the current and therefore does not affect the charge @xmath285 defined in  .",
