    "relativistic hydrodynamics is an important tool to describe high energy flow phenomena in different areas , such as heavy - ion collisions , relativistic astrophysics and cosmology , although its theoretical foundation has not yet been fully established , in particular , when dissipative processes are involved @xcite .",
    "the simplest formulation is a relativistic covariant extension of the non - relativistic navier - stokes equation .",
    "it is , however , known that relativistic navier - stokes theory suffers the problem of relativistic acausality and instability his , dkkm3,pu .    after the seminal work by israel and stewart @xcite , so far many different approaches of the relativistic hydrodynamics which are consistent with causality have been proposed @xcite . in the following , we call these theories as the causal dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics ( cdr ) @xcite",
    ". the crucial difference of any cdr theories from the navier - stokes theory can be characterized by the introduction of finite relaxation times in the definitions of irreversible currents .",
    "this aspect is somehow overlooked but has an important consequence .",
    "that is , any relativistically causal fluids will be _ non - newtonian _ in the sense that irreversible currents are no longer simply proportional to the corresponding thermodynamic forces while their _ newtonian _ counterparts are .    in hydrodynamics ,",
    "all transport coefficients such as the shear viscosity and the bulk viscosity are inputs and should be determined from a microscopic theory . in the case of the navier - stokes theory ,",
    "the coefficients are usually calculated by using two different approaches .",
    "one is the kinetic approach based mainly on the boltzmann equation , and the other is the microscopic approach using the green - kubo - nakano ( gkn ) formula .",
    "strictly speaking , the kinetic approach is applicable only to rarefied gas and not reliable in practice to calculate the transport coefficients for finite density systems .",
    "for example , the density expansion of the shear viscosity @xmath6 in three dimensional space is given by @xcite @xmath7what we can calculate from the boltzmann equation is only the first term @xmath8 .",
    "this is because the boltzmann equation is the lowest order approximation of the bbgky hierarchy equation and does not contain the information of multiple collisions which violates the important assumption of the boltzmann equation , that is , the molecular chaos . to calculate the further expansion coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the kinetic approach",
    ", we have to use , for example , the bogoliubov - choh - uhlenbeck equation which is a generalized boltzmann equation @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", systematic generalization of the relativistic boltzmann equation is not yet known .    on the other hand ,",
    "the gkn formula does not have such a limitation with respect to the finiteness of density as far as we know because it is derived from the microscopic theory , quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "however , for a relativistic fluid , we have to be careful because the newtonian property of a fluid is assumed to derive the gkn formula .",
    "thus new formulism is needed to calculate the transport coefficients of cdr .",
    "transport phenomena such as viscosities , diffusion and heat conduction in hydrodynamics are related rather to the changes in a sort of boundary conditions than to the responses of the system to an external mechanical perturbation .",
    "for this reason , the required formulation should be different from the ordinary linear response theory .",
    "this fact is already emphasized by kubo @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the well - known expressions of transport coefficients of relativistic hydrodynamics are obtained by using the non - equilibrium statistical operator method by zubarev @xcite .",
    "so far , several different approaches have been proposed to calculate the transport coefficients : indirect kubo method , langevin - fokker - planck method , regression hypothesis based method , local equilibrium approach , external reservoir method , and prediction theory , and so on .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "recently , the authors of the present paper proposed a new microscopic formula to calculate the shear viscosity and the corresponding relaxation time of cdr using the projection operator method , which belongs to the langevin - fokker - planck method in the classification mentioned above @xcite .",
    "our formula is expressed in terms of the time correlation functions of microscopic currents and is a natural extension of the gkn formula .",
    "we showed that for the shear viscosity , it reproduces the gkn results in the leading order .",
    "when applied to a navier - stokes fluid and non - relativistic diffusion coefficients , our approach reproduces the well - known results , as is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive the microscopic formulae of the bulk viscosity @xmath0 and the corresponding relaxation time @xmath11 in the framework of the projection operator method @xcite .",
    "we apply the result to the pionic fluid and calculate in the leading order approximation in the chiral perturbation theory with the renormalizable energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we find that the relaxation time @xmath1 is enhanced around the temperature near the qcd phase transition .",
    "we further discuss the differences among our formalism , the kinetic theory @xcite and the string theory @xcite . in a cdr",
    ", the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 should satisfy the causality condition , which is derived by employing that the propagating speed of a physical signal should not exceed the speed of light .",
    "if this condition is violated , relativistic fluids becomes unstable @xcite .",
    "we confirm that the values of transport coefficients obtained by all the three different approaches are consistent with the causality condition .",
    "it should be noted that the bulk viscosity and the corresponding relaxation time are important not only for heavy - ion collision physics , but also for astrophysics , for example , the stability windows in parameter space of rotating compact stars @xcite , driving inflation in early universe and the associating entropy production @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we give a brief review of the projection operator method in sec .",

    "[ sec : bulk ] , we apply the method and derive expressions for the bulk viscosity and the relaxation time .",

    "the summary of our results concludes this work in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] . through this paper",
    ", we will use metric @xmath12 and the natural units @xmath13 .",
    "for the later convenience , let us briefly review the projection operator method  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the projection operator method was firstly proposed by nakajima @xcite , although it is often referred as the mori - zwanzig formalism due to the extensive use and developments done by these authors @xcite .",
    "many dynamical variables of practical interest , such as the conserved quantities , usually vary slowly in time comparing to other microscopic quantities .",
    "we call them gross variables . in order to discuss the dynamics of these slowly varying relevant variables , we need to introduce a coarse - graining procedure to smoothing out the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the projection operator method provides a systematic way to extract the information of the relevant coarse - grained dynamics from underlining microscopic theories .    in the case of a quantum system ,",
    "the full microscopic dynamics is described by the heisenberg equation of motion , @xmath14\\equiv ilo(t),\\]]where @xmath15 is an arbitrary operator and @xmath16 is the hamiltonian . for simplicity , here we have assumed that @xmath16 is independent of time . see refs .",
    "@xcite for the case of a system with time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "the second equality defines the liouville operator @xmath17 . in order to project out the irrelevant information associated with variables of microscopic ( short ) time scales ,",
    "we introduce a time - independent projection operator @xmath4 and its complementary operator @xmath18 , which satisfy the following general properties , @xmath19with the help of these operators , the heisenberg equation of motion can be re - expressed as @xcite @xmath20    this is called the time - convolution ( tc ) equation and its r.  h.  s. is composed of three distinct parts .",
    "the first term is called the streaming term and usually corresponds to collective oscillations such as plasma wave and spin wave .",
    "the second term is called the memory term which turns into the dissipation term after a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the third term is identified with the noise term after implementing coarse - graining of time , as we will see later .",
    "thus this equation is considered as a generalized langevin equation . as a matter of fact",
    ", the memory term and the noise term are related through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem of second kind mori , kk .",
    "note that the tc equation is very general and still equivalent to the heisenberg equation of motion .",
    "the choice of the most appropriate projection operator depends on the specific properties of a given system and also on the coarse - graining procedure which we wish to introduce .",
    "if we choose the projection operator so as to extract all the relevant gross ( in our case , hydrodynamic ) variables , we can , in principle , derive hydrodynamic equations from the tc equation . for this purpose",
    ", we use the mori projection operator @xcite .",
    "let @xmath21be a @xmath22-dimensional vector formed by @xmath22 time - independent operators corresponding to the gross variables @xmath23 where the notation @xmath24 is used to distinguish the schrdinger operator from its heisenberg form , @xmath25 .",
    "we choose @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 .",
    "then the time - independent mori projection operator @xmath4 is defined as @xcite @xmath28where @xmath15 is an arbitrary operator , and the coefficient @xmath29 is given by @xmath30here @xmath31 denotes the inner product of two arbitrary operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see below ) , and @xmath34 denotes @xmath35 element of the inverse matrix of @xmath36 i.e. , @xmath37 in this way , we expect that the relevant part of an arbitrary operator is expressed as a function of the gross variables by operating this projection operator . in order to follow the dynamics of the gross variables in time",
    ", we would need the time - dependent projections @xcite , but for the present purpose of calculating the transport coefficients , the time independent projection is sufficient .",
    "we are still left with the freedom to choose the definition of the inner product . here , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we use kubo s canonical correlation , @xmath38,\\]]where @xmath39 $ ] with @xmath40 being the inverse of temperature .",
    "one can see that , if it is a classical system , kubo s canonical correlation is reduced to the usual classical thermal expectation value . thus kubo s canonical correlation is the quantum generalization of the classical expectation values .",
    "it is easy to confirm that @xmath41    finally , the tc equation for the gross variable @xmath42 in the heisenberg picture can be expressed as @xmath43where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are operators of @xmath46matrices and @xmath47 is a @xmath22-vector whose elements are given by @xmath48    if the set of @xmath22-gross variables",
    "@xmath49 is appropriately chosen so as to extract all the dynamics associated with the slow hydrodynamic time scale , we expect that the dynamical variation time - scale of the last term @xmath50 of eq.([morieq ] ) should be very small compared to the hydrodynamic time scale , because the projection operator @xmath51 projects out components only orthogonal to @xmath49 .",
    "for this reason the term @xmath50 is called the noise term .",
    "in this section , we derive the microscopic formulae for the bulk viscosity @xmath0 and the corresponding relaxation time @xmath1 .",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "we derive the evolution equation of the bulk viscous pressure @xmath52 from the tc equation , and compare the derived microscopic equation with the phenomenological one to extract the microscopic formulae . for our purpose of obtaining the transport coefficient , it is sufficient to consider small deviation from the stationary back - ground - fluid in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the phenomenological equation of the bulk viscous pressure @xmath52 in a cdr is given by @xcite @xmath53where @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath54 are the bulk viscosity , the relaxation time and the fluid velocity , respectively . the first term on the l.h.s .",
    "represents the retardation effect of @xmath52 which is necessary to satisfy relativistic causality . for @xmath55 , eq .",
    "( eqn : phe_bulk1 ) is reduced to the usual navier - stokes constructive equation . in general , as is predicted from the kinetic theory , it is possible to introduce more non - linear terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phe_bulk1 ] ) but , as mentioned above , here we discuss only the lowest order equation consistent with a cdr .    in order to avoid the possible influence from the shear stress tensor , we consider a perturbation in infinite fluid in thermal equilibrium having a planar symmetry in @xmath56 plane .",
    "all the quantities associated with the perturbed fluid dynamics vary spatially only along the @xmath57 direction . in this case , the fluid velocity points to the @xmath57 direction ( if one wants to discuss shear viscosity only , one can choose the fluid velocity to point to the @xmath57 direction but vary spatially along the @xmath58 direction , as is done in ref .",
    "then , the equation of continuity of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath59 in momentum space is given by @xmath60where @xmath61 denotes the @xmath57-component of the momentum vector @xmath62 . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phe_bulk1 ] ) is simplified as @xmath63we use this equation as the definition of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 are the fourier transforms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .    in order to obtain the microscopic expressions of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we derive the equation for @xmath52 from the tc equation . for this purpose",
    ", we have to choose appropriate gross variables included in eq .",
    "( [ pheno_bulk ] ) to define the projection operator . among @xmath68 and @xmath69 ,",
    "the bulk viscous pressure @xmath52 is the deviation from the equilibrium pressure in the diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "thus we use the following operator representation , @xmath70where @xmath71 represents the equilibrium expectation value .",
    "furthermore , as we will discuss later , @xmath72 can be regarded as linearly dependent of @xmath73 in the lowest order of the perturbation .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ pheno_bulk ] ) contains basically two independent gross variables , @xmath74 where the bar notation , for example @xmath75 refers to the operator value of @xmath76 at @xmath77    according to eq .",
    "( [ project ] ) , the projection operator @xmath4 is now defined by @xmath78 substituting it into eq .",
    "( [ morieq ] ) , we obtain the following two equations , @xmath79where @xmath80and we used @xmath81note that we consider homogeneous energy density and pressure . then the first equation is nothing but just eq.([txo ] ) , that is , the equation of continuity , and the second equation describes the non - trivial evolution of @xmath52 .",
    "the exact expression of the memory function @xmath82 is given in ref .",

    "( [ langevin2 ] ) , the evolution of @xmath83 is given by @xmath84here we used @xmath85 , which is calculated from the definition of @xmath86 .",

    "finally , the memory function in low @xmath61 and @xmath90 limit is given by @xmath91    to extract the phenomenological equation ( [ pheno_bulk ] ) , we have to violate the time reversal symmetry . for this purpose",
    ", we implement the coarse - graining of time .",
    "let us introduce a macroscopic time scale @xmath92 as follows @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a scale parameter and less than one .",
    "then the time - convolution integral is expressed as @xmath95 when the microscopic and macroscopic time scales are clearly separated , we can take the the vanishing @xmath94 limit .",
    "then the integral is given by @xmath96 we call this coarse - grainings the time - convolutionless ( tcl ) approximation .",
    "note that this approximation is very similar to the so - called markov approximation . in the present case ,",
    "however , there is still the memory effect for @xmath52 even after the tcl approximation and we can not call it the markov approximation . with this approximation , eq .",

    "note here that , for fermion field and gauge field , the usual definition of energy - momentum tensor is already renormalizable and do not need any re - definition of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "however , because of the reason which will be discussed in the end of this section , this is still not the definition of the bulk viscous pressure which is used in the following calculation .",
    "we recall that the behavior of the retarded green function @xmath120 in the low momentum limit is not changed by adding an additional term which is proportional to the energy density in the definition of the bulk viscous pressure .",

    "as was shown by kadanoff and martin @xcite and later by one of the present authors @xcite , the ratio of the diffusion coefficient @xmath165 and the corresponding relaxation time @xmath166 is exactly determined from a sum rule .",
    "( b.10 ) , ( b.16 ) and ( b.28 ) of ref . @xcite",
    ". then we obtain @xmath167 where @xmath22 is the conserved number density and @xmath168 . in the projection operator method , this result is reproduced only when the tcl approximation is applied .",
    "that is , if we regard that the tcl approximation as the lowest order of the taylor expansion and the next order correction is considered , we obtain the result which is inconsistent with the initial value theorem and the sum rule .    when we observe with the time scale where the structure of the memory function in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) can not be neglected , it means that there still exists macroscopic degrees of freedom in the memory function . in order to finish the program of coarse - graining in the projection operator method",
    ", we have to re - define the projection operator so as to extract this macroscopic degree of freedom .",
    "then the form of hydrodynamics itself is changed and the obtained equation is not given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phe_bulk1 ] ) anymore . in other words , once we assume that the hydrodynamic equation is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phe_bulk1 ] ) , we must observe with the time scale where the structure of the memory function is negligible , and hence , we must use the tcl approximation instead of the taylor expansion .    as an example of the time dependence of the memory function ,",
    "see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "one can see that the memory function has finite values only around @xmath169 .      in this work",
    ", we used the phenomenological equation ( [ eqn : phe_bulk1 ] ) as the definition of the bulk viscosity @xmath123 and the relaxation time @xmath137 . on the other hand , it is possible to introduce non - linear terms to the phenomenological equation .",
    "for example , it might be possible to derive the hydrodynamic equation for the rarefied gas from the boltzmann equation , by using grad s moment method with the 14 moment approximation .",
    "in particular , the equation of the bulk viscous pressure is given by , @xcite @xmath170 where @xmath171 in order to obtain the microscopic expressions of these @xmath172 s in the projection operator method , the definition of the projection operator must be generalized so as to collect all gross variables appears in this non - linear equation .",
    "this will be put in future work .",
    "in this paper , we derived the microscopic formulae of the bulk viscosity @xmath123 and the corresponding relaxation time @xmath137 in causal dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics by using the projection operator method . applying these formulae to the pionic fluid and calculating in the leading order approximation in the chiral perturbation theory",
    ", we found that the relaxation time is enhanced around the temperature near the qcd phase transition , and there is a simple relation @xmath173 $ ] between @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we compared our result with the results of grad s moment method with the 14 moment approximation and the string theory by calculating the @xmath123-@xmath137 ratio which is independent of the choice of the collision term of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the ratio must be smaller than @xmath174 to satisfy the causality condition .",
    "we confirmed that all the three approaches are consistent with the causality condition .",
    "finally , we discussed that the time - convolutionless approximation , which is used to derive the transport coefficients , is consistent with exact results and we should not consider corrections to this approximation .    it should be emphasized that grad s moment method with the 14 moment approximation is not the unique method to calculate the transport coefficients of cdr from the boltzmann equation .",
    "recently a new calculation method based on the boltzmann equation was developed and it was found that the calculated transport coefficients are different from those of the 14 moment approximation @xcite .",
    "these new results are completely consistent with the leading order results of our formulae .",
    "this result was reported in another paper @xcite .",
