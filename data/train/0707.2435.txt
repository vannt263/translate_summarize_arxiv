    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of dilute atomic gases confined in optical and magnetic traps @xcite has opened new opportunities for investigating the coherence properties of degenerate quantum systems . from a theoretical point of view , under the usual experimental conditions these systems can be accurately described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite , a mean - field equation of motion governing the behavior of the condensate wave function @xmath0@xmath1 in the above equation @xmath2 is the number of atoms , @xmath3 is the interaction strength , @xmath4 is the _ s_-wave scattering length , and",
    "@xmath5 is the potential of the confining trap . in what follows",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the usual case of condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the gpe has proved to be very successful in describing the evolution in time of dilute quantum gases near the zero - temperature limit . from a mathematical point of view",
    "this equation is a time - dependent nonlinear differential equation .",
    "since no explicit analytical solutions are known , in general , eq .",
    "( [ i-1 ] ) has to be solved numerically .",
    "this is a nontrivial numerical task that demands a considerable computational effort .",
    "moreover , in many circumstances the superfluid dynamics of a zero - temperature condensate can become chaotic which requires large basis or grid point sets to guarantee convergence @xcite .",
    "in recent years there has been particular interest in becs confined in highly anisotropic traps @xcite . in such geometries",
    "the condensate is so tightly confined in the radial or the axial dimension that the corresponding dynamics becomes effectively one dimensional or two dimensional , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of these systems with reduced dimensionality is characterized by two very different time scales .",
    "even though usually one is only interested in the evolution of the slow degrees of freedom in the effective mean field induced by the fast degrees of freedom , from a computational point of view it is also required to resolve accurately the irrelevant fast degrees of freedom .",
    "it is clear that for sufficiently anisotropic traps this can represent a computational challenge .",
    "it is therefore convenient to develop theoretical models that permit one to study the condensate dynamics in terms of effective equations of lower dimensionality . in this",
    "regard various approaches have been followed in recent years @xcite . among them ,  the effective 1d and 2d nonpolynomial nonlinear schrdinger equations by salasnich _",
    "_ @xcite have proved the most efficient .    in this work",
    "we derive effective 1d and 2d wave equations that govern the dynamics of mean - field cigar - shaped and disk - shaped condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions .",
    "these equations which incorporate properly the contribution from the fast degrees of freedom have the correct limits in both the tf and the perturbative regime .",
    "even though the equations by salasnich _",
    "_ are in general very accurate , we demonstrate that our effective equations are more accurate .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of its simplicity , they also permit one to obtain fully analytical expressions for various relevant ground - state properties such as chemical potentials , condensate lengths , density profiles , and local sound velocities .",
    "consider a bec confined in a highly elongated trap .",
    "the high anisotropy of the trap has important consequences on the condensate dynamics which under usual conditions becomes governed by two very different time scales . in these circumstances",
    "the characteristic evolution time of the fast transverse motion ( @xmath7 ) is so small in comparison with the characteristic time scale of the axial motion ( @xmath8 ) that one can assume that at every instant of time the transverse degrees of freedom adjust instantaneously to the lowest - energy configuration compatible with the axial configuration occurring at that time ( _ adiabatic approximation _ ) .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the correlations between transverse and axial motions can be neglected and the condensate wave function can be factorized as @xcite@xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the local condensate density per unit length characterizing the axial configuration@xmath12 normalizing the transverse wave function to unity@xmath13 eq .",
    "( [ ii-2 ] ) takes the desirable form@xmath14    substituting now the wave function ( [ ii-1 ] ) into the gpe and assuming the confining potential to be separable as @xmath15 , one obtains@xmath16 both the axial and time variations induced in the transverse wave function @xmath17 by the axial density @xmath18 have been neglected in the above equation .",
    "neglecting the time derivative of @xmath17 is in fact the essence of the adiabatic approximation already discussed .",
    "neglecting the second derivative of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath19 requires the axial density to vary sufficiently slowly along the axial direction . for condensates in highly elongated traps such condition",
    "usually holds in most cases of practical interest .    multiplying eq .",
    "( [ ii-5 ] ) by @xmath20 and integrating on the transverse coordinates @xmath21 we arrive at@xmath22 where we have defined@xmath23 equation ( [ ii-6 ] ) is an effective 1d mean - field equation that governs the axial dynamics of cigar - shaped becs , incorporating the contribution from the transverse degrees of freedom through @xmath24 .",

    "( [ ii-6 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ii-5 ] ) yields@xmath25 which shows that at every instant of time and @xmath19 plane the transverse wave function @xmath17 satisfies the _ stationary _ gpe of an axially homogeneous condensate characterized by a density per unit length @xmath26 , with @xmath24 being the corresponding ( transverse ) local chemical potential .",
    "clearly , the usefulness of the effective 1d axial equation ( [ ii-6 ] ) depends , to a great extent , on the possibility of finding a simple way of solving eq .",
    "( [ ii-8 ] ) . in this regard ,",
    "it is important to note that @xmath18 enters the equation above as a mere external parameter , so that , in practice , the solution of the transverse equation does not require the knowledge of the axial evolution . before considering this problem in more detail",
    "we will first take a look at the condensate stationary states , which must satisfy@xmath27 substituting in eq .",
    "( [ ii-6 ] ) one obtains@xmath28 where the condensate chemical potential@xmath29 is the lagrange parameter that guarantees the normalization condition @xmath30 .",

    ", i.e.,@xmath33 then the first term on the left in eq . ( [ ii-10 ] ) can be neglected in comparison with the mean - field interaction energy and one arrives at the local density approximation@xmath34 when this equation is applicable , the knowledge of the transverse chemical potential permits one to obtain an analytic expression for the ground - state axial condensate profile @xmath35 . in any case , as eq .",
    "( [ ii-6 ] ) shows , the analytic determination of @xmath24 is the key ingredient to derive a useful 1d effective equation of motion for the condensate axial dynamics .",
    "we shall concentrate in what follows on cigar - shaped condensates confined in the radial direction by an axisymmetric harmonic potential characterized by an oscillator length @xmath36,@xmath37 introducing dimensionless variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the transverse equation ( [ ii-8 ] ) determining the local chemical potential @xmath40 takes the form @xcite @xmath41 this equation , that depends on the sole parameter @xmath42 , can be analytically solved in two limiting cases . when @xmath43 the mean - field interaction energy can be treated as a weak perturbation . in this perturbative regime",
    "the condensate wave function that minimizes the energy functional is given , to the lowest order , by the gaussian ground state of the harmonic oscillator and the condensate is tightly confined in the radial direction . under these conditions the radial motion is frozen out , restricted to zero - point oscillations , and the condensate becomes effectively one dimensional .",
    "thus the perturbative regime corresponds to quasi-1d mean - field condensates with a local chemical potential given by@xmath44 when @xmath45 the kinetic energy term can be safely neglected in comparison with the mean - field interaction energy .",
    "this is the thomas - fermi regime , in which many modes of the transverse harmonic trap become excited and the condensate exhibits a parabolic radial profile@xmath46 where the local chemical potential ensuring normalization is now given by@xmath47 note that in passing from the thomas - fermi regime to the perturbative regime the system undergoes an effective dimensional crossover from a 3d cigar - shaped condensate to a quasi-1d mean - field condensate .    in previous works @xcite , by using a suitable approximation scheme , we derived general approximate formulas that provide with remarkable accuracy ( typically better than @xmath48 ) the ground - state properties of any mean - field scalar bose - einstein condensate with short - range repulsive interatomic interactions , confined in arbitrary cylindrically symmetric harmonic traps , and even containing a multiply quantized axisymmetric vortex .",
    "this approximation scheme essentially represents an extension of the thomas - fermi approximation that incorporates conveniently the zero - point energy contribution . in the limiting cases of cigar - shaped and disk - shaped condensates the ground - state properties follow from explicit analytical formulas that reduce to the correct analytical expressions in both the tf and the perturbative regimes , and",
    "remain valid and accurate in between these two limiting cases , thus accounting properly for the corresponding dimensional crossover .",
    "physical quantities such as the condensate radius , axial length , chemical potential , mean - field interaction energy , kinetic and potential energies , density profiles , and local sound velocities can be easily and accurately obtained in this way in terms of the physically relevant parameters ( number of atoms , trap aspect ratio , and vortex charge ) . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that the transverse local chemical potential of a condensate with an axisymmetric vortex of charge @xmath49 , as a function of the condensate density per unit length @xmath18 , is given by@xmath50 with@xmath51 the parameter @xmath52 accounts for the dilution effect that the centrifugal force associated with the vortex has on the condensate mean density @xcite . in the absence of vortices @xmath53 ,",
    "the equation above simplifies to@xmath54 clearly , in the appropriate limits , this equation reduces to the quasi-1d and tf expressions ( [ ii-15 ] ) and ( [ ii-17 ] ) , respectively . as we shall see , it also describes correctly the corresponding dimensional crossover .",
    "the above equations were derived in  ref .",
    "@xcite by using a suitable tf - like ansatz for the local density @xmath55 of a harmonically trapped bec in its ground state .",
    "such local density , which is not factorizable in general , is defined in a volume that corresponds to the usual tf ellipsoidal density cloud conveniently truncated in order to account for the zero - point energy contribution .",
    "note that even though the expression ( [ ii-18 ] ) was originally obtained for a condensate in its ground state ( compatible with an axisymmetric vortex of charge @xmath49 ) and axially confined by a harmonic potential , it is , however , of general validity .",
    "this is so because , as already said , the solution of the transverse equation ( [ ii-14 ] ) does not depend on the particular axial evolution . to convince the reader that this is the case we have numerically solved eq .",

    "the maximum error is smaller than @xmath48 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and smaller than @xmath61 for @xmath62 . even though one expects @xcite this maximum error to increase with @xmath49 , it is still smaller than @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "this demonstrates that the local chemical potential as given by eq .",
    "( [ ii-18 ] ) is an accurate solution of the transverse equation ( [ ii-8 ] ) .",
    "this result is of interest in its own right .",

    "@xcite , it has been shown that the velocity of sound in an axially uniform bose - einstein condensate immersed in a 1d optical lattice and radially confined by a harmonic trap can be obtained , in a wide range of optical lattice depths , from the knowledge of the local chemical potential @xmath65 as a function of the linear average density @xmath66 , with @xmath67 being the lattice period .",
    "in such an approach the effect of the lattice is incorporated into a suitable renormalization of the mass and of the coupling constant . in the present work , however , the main interest of eq .",
    "( [ ii-18 ] ) comes from the fact that when substituted in eq .",
