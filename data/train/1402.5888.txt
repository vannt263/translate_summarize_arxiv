    "low - gain ( spontaneous ) parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) is one of the most common sources of entangled photons  @xcite . at high parametric gain , pdc generates bright squeezed vacuum ( bsv ) where the photon number per mode can reach several orders of magnitude  @xcite . in both high - gain and low - gain regimes ,",
    "pdc is an essentially multimode source and a lot of effort is spent to prepare its output in a single - mode state @xcite since many applications require single - mode beams . in order to address the problem one has to understand the characteristics of these modes",
    "this is usually done by employing a decomposition of the state into its coherent modes , called the schmidt decomposition . when the patterns of the modes are known , it is possible to employ some kind of filtering that matches the shape of a single mode .    in many cases ,",
    "the spatial distribution of pdc radiation can be well described in the double - gauss approximation  @xcite .",
    "then , the schmidt decomposition can be performed analytically and the modes are hermite - gaussian  @xcite ( alternatively , laguerre - gaussian basis can be used ) . however , to achieve the high - gain regime",
    ", one should focus the pump tightly and use longer crystals , and then the effect of transverse walk - off becomes noticeable .",
    "it manifests itself in the asymmetry of the spatial distributions for both the intensity and the correlation function  @xcite .",
    "the resulting angular spectrum can no longer be decomposed into hermite - gaussian or laguerre - gaussian modes",
    ".    it has been known for decades that high - gain parametric amplification can be improved by using two crystals with the optic axes tilted oppositely  @xcite and this configuration was used in the first experiments on squeezing  @xcite . at the same time , no analysis of the spectral distribution was made and the schmidt decomposition was never discussed . in this paper",
    "we study the angular structure of the pdc radiation generated in the walk - off compensating configuration .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of two - photon light since for this regime the theoretical model is well known and we can compare the experimental results with the calculation . a similar experiment with bsv has been described in ref .",
    "the quantum state of two - photon light generated via pdc is given by @xmath3 , known as the two - photon amplitude ( tpa ) , is the probability amplitude that the signal photon is emitted at an angle @xmath4 and the idler photon at an angle @xmath5 .",
    "alternatively , the tpa can be written in the transverse coordinate representation , as the probability amplitude @xmath6 that the signal photon leaves the crystal at the transverse position @xmath7 and the idler photon at the transverse position @xmath8 . using this distribution it is possible to fully describe the spatial distribution of two - photon light , in particular to find the schmidt decomposition and the shape of each mode .",
    "the tpa can be found from the hamiltonian @xmath9 of the pdc , as the state ( [ eqn : biphotonstate ] ) can be written in the first order of the perturbation theory , @xmath10    the hamiltonian that describes the pdc process , in its turn , is proportional to the volume integral of the product of the three fields involved , namely the pump , the signal , and the idler , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the volume of the crystal in which the interaction takes place and @xmath13 is the quadratic susceptibility . the signal and idler fields @xmath14 must be described as quantum ones but since the pump @xmath15 is a strong laser field it is sufficient to consider it as a classical gaussian beam .    because the pump beam usually has extraordinary polarisation , inside the nonlinear crystal it undergoes the walk - off effect .",
    "namely , even if the pump is incident perpendicular to the crystal , its poynting vector inside the crystal will be tilted by an angle @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : onecrystalanisotropy ] ) , while the wave vector remains in the same direction as outside of the crystal .",
    "the direction of the walk - off is determined by the angle between the wave vector of the pump and the optic axis .",
    "when the pump waist is smaller or comparable to the transverse displacement due to the walk - off ( the walk - off distance ) , the spatial distribution of pdc radiation is not symmetric any more  @xcite .",
    "0.49   depends on the angle of the pump wave vector with the optic axis c and the crystal birefringence .",
    "( b ) compensation of the anisotropy effect is obtained by using two crystals with the optic axes tilted in opposite directions . in the two crystals , the walk - off , as well as",

    "[ fig : anisotropycompensation ] .",
    "the resulting spatial distribution is symmetric but due to the free space propagation between the crystals the pdc radiation generated in different crystals acquires a relative phase .",
    "the interference between light generated in the first and in the second crystal leads to a fringe pattern .    in our consideration ,",
    "the system consists of two bbo crystals cut for collinear type i  eoo \" phase matching such that the pump is impinging perpendicular to their entrance faces . for this configuration",
    "there are no additional effects due to refraction .",
    "the anisotropy manifests itself in the asymmetry of the angular distributions of the intensity and two - photon correlations .",
    "it is mainly visible for the angular distributions in the principal plane , that is , in the plane formed by the pump wavevector and the optic axis .",
    "however , as we show further , it also reveals itself in the plane orthogonal to the principal one , although in this case the effect is more subtle .",
    "further , we will refer to these two cases as the ones of ` strong anisotropy ' and ` weak anisotropy ' .",
    "accordingly , we will assume the principal plane to be oriented arbitrarily with respect to the ` laboratory ' axes @xmath17 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . the angle between the principal plane and the @xmath18 axis will be denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 axis of our frame of reference coincides with the direction of the pump outside the crystal .",
    "the polarisation of the pump is always considered parallel to the principal plane , in order to provide phase matching . correspondingly , inside the crystal , the pump beam propagates at the walk - off angle @xmath16 to the @xmath20 axis ( fig .",

    ", one should perform the volume integration in ( [ eqn : h ] ) and then substitute the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wavefunction ] ) .",
    "the fields are represented , as usual , through the photon creation and annihilation operators in plane - wave modes  @xcite and for the pump field we assume a gaussian distribution propagating along the path shown in fig .",

    "if one projects the tpa onto one of the axes ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) the so - called unconditional distribution is obtained .",
    "this correspond to measuring the angular distribution of the signal or the idler radiation separately .",
    "furthermore , the slice through the tpa at a fixed value of @xmath5 , in other words the probability to observe a signal photon conditioned on the event of having the idler photon at @xmath5 , is known as the conditional distribution .    until now only one crystal was taken into account . if a second crystal , identical to the first one , is positioned right after it , the tpas of the two crystals will add up .",
    "if both crystals have the same orientation of the optical axis , then also the anisotropy will be equal in both crystals .",
    "we will refer to this situation as the non - compensation case .",
    "when the second crystal is rotated by @xmath31 along the @xmath18 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropycompensation ] ) then the effects of anisotropy in the two crystals are opposite . the total probability distribution of the radiation generated by both crystals is given by the sum of their tpas with the relative phase  @xcite that depends on the distance @xmath32 between the two crystals , @xmath33 + f_2(\\theta_s,\\theta_i ) , \\label{eqn : phase}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the wave vectors of the pump , signal , and idler radiation in the space between the crystals and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the tpas of the first and the second crystal respectively .",
    "these differ in three parameters : the limits of integration for @xmath39 that are from 0 to @xmath40 for the first crystal and from @xmath40 to @xmath41 for the second , the sign of @xmath16 that is opposite for the compensation configuration and the sign of @xmath13 that depends on the direction of the optic axis ( shown by arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) . due to the phase factor",
    "the resulting tpa will show interference that can be constructive or destructive depending on the sign of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . in order to produce pdc we utilised two bbo crystals with @xmath42 mm length .",
    "the crystals were cut for collinear frequency - degenerate type - i phase matching , so that the optic axes formed an angle of @xmath43 with the @xmath20 axis . the pump laser operated in the continuous - wave mode at @xmath44 nm . a half wave plate ( hwp )",
    "was used to change the polarisation of the pump to horizontal ( which corresponded to extraordinary polarisation in our crystals ) .",
    "the two crystals were separated by a distance @xmath45 mm .",
    "considering the parameters of the crystals and the pump , the walk - off angle was @xmath46 and hence the walk - off distance in one crystal was 67.4 @xmath47 m . in order to be able to observe the effect of anisotropy",
    "the beam waist should be at least comparable to the walk - off .",
    "this was achieved by focusing the pump with a lens ( @xmath48 cm ) , with the beam waist right between the crystals . with the help of a ccd camera we have measured a beam waist of 78 @xmath47 m . in order to completely remove the pump radiation we used a dichroic mirror reflecting wavelengths below @xmath49 nm and a bandpass filter transmitting around 808 nm with 3 nm fwhm .",
    "a glan - thompson prism was further used to remove any remaining pump radiation . to separate the signal and idler radiation , we used a 50:50 beamsplitter .",
    "each part of the split beam passed trough a lens with a focal length of @xmath50 cm . in the corresponding focal planes ,",
    "two 100@xmath47 m pinholes were positioned .",
    "after that , the radiation was collected by fibre collimators and coupled to the single photon detectors ( si - apds ) . in both arms",

    "[ fig : onecrystalanisotropy ] .",
    "the distortions introduced by anisotropy are evident .",

    "figures  [ fig : unconditionalnocompensetion ] , [ fig : conditionalnocompensetion ] show the measured unconditional and conditional distributions as well as the theoretical predictions .",
    "as previously discussed , due to the space between the two crystals , the effect of interference is also visible.the reduction of visibility in the experimental data is mainly due to the width of the pinhole used to scan the distribution .",
    "the position of the fringes depends on the distance between the crystals .",

    "0.32     0.32     0.32     from fig .",
    "[ fig : tpanocompensation ] , it is clear that the tpa becomes even more bent than in the single - crystal case .",
    "accordingly , the unconditional distribution becomes even more asymmetric .",
    "we then rotated the second crystal by @xmath31 in order to pass to the anisotropy compensation configuration .",
    "the optic axis of the second crystal was then at @xmath59 and the phase matching was still fulfilled . in this case",
    "the tpa of the second crystal is bent oppositely with respect to that of the first one .",
    "the two contributions are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpacompensation ] .",
    "as expected , the transverse distributions are symmetric but still show interference .",

    "0.32     0.32     0.32     although in this configuration the effect of anisotropy is more subtle , both conditional and unconditional distributions also indicate it by a certain change in the width with respect to the case where anisotropy is absent .",
    "as already mentioned , an important task is selecting a single schmidt mode of two - photon light and this task is much simplified if the first ( strongest ) mode is gaussian .",
    "the schmidt decomposition for type - i degenerate collinear two - photon state is @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the schmidt modes for signal and idler photons ( note that they are identical in our case ) .",
    "the schmidt coefficient @xmath64 gives the weight of a given mode @xmath65 .",
    "since the fundamental gaussian is the most convenient mode to work with , it is logical to aim for a high corresponding schmidt coefficient .    using the tpas calculated above",
    ", we numerically performed the schmidt decomposition for the case of an individual 2 mm crystal and also for the anisotropy compensation case using two 1 mm crystals . in the first case the dominant schmidt mode @xmath66 has a gaussian shape ( the overlap integral is 0.997 ) and a weight @xmath67 ( fig .",

    "the dominant mode is still gaussian with even a higher overlap integral ( 0.999 ) and a much larger weight @xmath68 ( fig .",

    "0.32     0.32",
    "we have studied the tpa for two - photon light emitted via pdc from two crystals oriented in such a way that the transverse walk - off is compensated .",
    "the compensation is achieved due to the opposite tilt of the optic axes in the two crystals and therefore opposite directions of the walk - off . both the theoretical calculation and",
    "the experimental results show that , in contrast to the case of a single crystal or two crystals with the optic axes oriented parallel ( non - compensating configuration ) , the tpa becomes closer to gaussian and the angular distributions of both intensity and coincidences become symmetric .",
    "importantly , compensation of the anisotropy leads to a tpa whose schmidt decomposition is much closer to that given by the double - gaussian model than in the non - compensated case .",
    "the first schmidt mode is very close to gaussian and hence can be filtered out using a single - mode optical fibre .",
    "this is especially important at high - gain pdc , where bright squeezed vacuum is produced .",
    "the existence of the interference fringes adds non - gaussian features to the tpa ; however , by minimising the distance between the two crystals it is possible to have a maximum at the centre .",
    "in this situation the schmidt decomposition feature a first schmidt mode close to gaussian ."
