    "possible explanations for these anomalies have been suggested such as improper foreground subtraction , wmap systematics , statistical flukes ; the possibilities of topological or cosmological origins for them have been proposed as well .",

    "moreover , even in the event isotropization should occur , there is a chance that signatures from anisotropic inflation or from an anisotropic pre - inflationary era might still be visible today @xcite . in the same contest of searching for models of the early universe that might produce some anisotropy signatures at late time ,",

    "the attempt to explain some of the cmb `` anomalous '' features as the indication of a break of statistical isotropy is the main reason behind ours and many of the existing inflationary models populated by vector fields , but not the only one . the first one of these models @xcite was formulated with the goal of producing inflation by the action of vector fields , without having to invoke the existence of a scalar field . the same motivations inspired the works that followed @xcite .",
    "lately , models where primordial vector fields can leave an imprint on the cmb have been formulated as an alternative to the basic inflationary scenario , in the search for interesting non - gaussianity predictions @xcite .",

    "all this appears to us as a rich bag of motivations for investigating these scenarios .",

    "we will also shortly discuss the mechanisms of production of the curvature fluctuations in these models .",
    "+ building a model where primordial vector fields can drive inflation and/or produce the observed spectrum of large scale fluctuations requires a more complex lagrangian than the basic gauge invariant @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , for a conformally invariant theory as the one described by @xmath16 , vector fields fluctuations are not excited on superhorizon scales . it is then necessary to modify the lagrangian .",
    "for some of the existing models , these modifications have been done to the expense of destabilizing the theory , by `` switching on '' unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "this was pointed out in @xcite , where a large variety of vector field models was analyzed in which longitudinal polarization modes exist that are endowed with negative squared masses ( the `` wrong '' signs of the masses are imposed for the theory to satisfy the constraints that allow a suitable background evolution ) .",
    "it turnes out that , in a range of interest of the theory , these fields acquire negative total energy , i.e. behave like `` ghosts '' , the presence of which is known to be responsible for an unstable vacuum . a related problem for some of these theories is represented by the existence of instabilities affecting the equations of motion of the ghost fields @xcite .",
    "+ in the remaing part of this section , we are going to present some of these models together with some recent attempts to overcome their limits .",
    "+ in all of the models we will consider , primordial vector fields fluctuations end up either being entirely responsible for or only partially contributing to the curvature fluctuations at late times .",
    "this can happen through different mechanisms .",
    "if the vector fields affects the universe expansion during inflation , its contribution @xmath17 to the total @xmath1 can be derived from combining the definition of the number of e - foldings ( @xmath18 ) with the einstein equation ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the energy density of the vector field and @xmath21 the inflaton energy density ) and using the @xmath22n expansion of the curvature fluctuation in terms of both the inflaton and the vector fields fluctuations ( see sec .",
    "to lowest order we have @xcite [ direct ] _ a = a_i , where a single vector field has been taken into account for simplicity ( @xmath23 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath24 is the background value of the field and @xmath25 its perturbation ) . when calculating the amplitude of non - gaussianity in sec .  5",
    ", we will refer to this case as `` vector inflation '' for simplicity .",
    "+ a different fluctuation production process is the curvaton mechanism which was initially formulated for scalar theories but it is also applicable to vectors @xcite .",
    "specifically , inflation is driven by a scalar field , whereas the curvaton field(s ) ( now played by the vectors ) , has a very small ( compared to the hubble rate ) mass during inflation . towards the end of the inflationary epoch ,",
    "the hubble rate value starts decreasing until it equates the vector mass ; when this eventually happens , the curvaton begins to oscillate and it will then dissipate its energy into radiation . the curvaton becomes responsible for a fraction of the total curvature fluctuation that is proportional to a parameter ( @xmath26 ) related to the ratio between the curvaton energy density and the total energy density of the universe at the epoch of the curvaton decay  @xcite [ indirect ] _ a= , where @xmath27 .",
    "anisotropy bounds on the power spectrum favour small values of @xmath26 . + from eqs .",
    "( [ direct ] ) and ( [ indirect ] ) we can see that , dependending on which one of these two mechanisms of production of the curvature fluctuations is considered , different coefficients will result in the @xmath22n expansion ( see eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) ) .",
    "+ in this section we will describe both models where inflation is intended to be vector field driven and those models in which , instead , the role of the inflaton is played by a scalar field , whereas the energy of the vector is kept subdominant in the total energy density of the universe during the entire inflationary phase .",
    "a pioneer work on vector field driven inflation was formulated by l.  h.  ford @xcite , who considered a single self - coupled field @xmath28 with a lagrangian l_vector =- f_f^+v ( ) where @xmath29 and the potential @xmath30 is a function of @xmath31 .",
    "different scenarios of expansion are analyzed by the author for different functions @xmath30 .",
    "the universe expands anisotropically at the end of the inflationary era and this anisotropy either survives until late times or is damped out depending on the shape and the location of the minima of the potential .",
    "+ the study of perturbations in a similar model was proposed by dimopoulos in @xcite where he showed that for a lagrangian [ dimopoulos ] l_vector =- f_f^+m^2 b_b^ and for @xmath32 , the transverse mode of the vector field is governed by the same equation of motion as a light scalar field in a de sitter stage .",
    "a suitable superhorizon power spectrum of fluctuations could therefore arise . in order to prevent production of large scale anisotropy ,",
    "in this model the vector field plays the role of the curvaton while inflation is driven by a scalar field .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ dimopoulos ] ) may be also intended , at least during inflation , as including a non - minimal coupling of the vector field to gravity ; indeed the mass term can be rewritten as [ lag ] l_vector(m^2_0+r)b_b^ where , for the whole duration of the inflationary era , the bare mass @xmath33 is assumed to be much smaller than the hubble rate and the ricci scalar @xmath34 $ ] can be approximated as @xmath35 . for the specific value @xmath36 , eq .",

    "+ the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) with @xmath36 was also employed in @xcite , where inflation is scalar - field - driven and a primordial vector field affects large - scale curvature fluctuations and , similarly , in @xcite , which includes a study of the backreaction of the vector field on the dynamics of expansion , by introducing a bianchi type - i metric .",
    "a model was proposed in @xcite where lagrange multipliers ( @xmath38 ) are employed to determine a fixed norm primordial vector field @xmath39 [ acw ] l_vector(b^b_-m^2)- _ where @xmath40 is a vacuum energy .",
    "the expansion rate in this scenario is anisotropic : if we orient the @xmath41-axis of the spatial frame along the direction determined by the vector field , we find two different hubble rates : along the @xmath41-direction it is equal to h_b^2= , and it is given by @xmath42 along the orthogonal directions ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 is a polynomial function of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a parameter appearing in the kinetic part of the lagrangian that we omitted in ( [ acw ] ) ( see @xcite for its complete expression ) .",
    "as expected , an isotropic expansion is recovered if the vev of the vector field is set to zero .",
    "most of the models mentioned so far successfully solve the problem of attaining a slow - roll regime for the vector - fields without imposing too many restrictions on the parameters of the theory and of avoiding excessive production of anisotropy at late times .",
    "none of them though escapes those instabilities related to the negative energy of the longitudinal modes ( although a study of the instabilities for fixed - norm field models was done in @xcite where some stable cases with non - canonical kinetic terms were found ) . as discussed in @xcite , in the self - coupled model a ghost appears at small ( compared to the horizon ) wavelengths ; in the non - minimally coupled and in the fixed - norm cases instead the instability concerns the region around horizon crossing .",
    "+ models with varying gauge coupling can overcome the problem of instabilities and have recently attracted quite some attention . in @xcite ,",

    "the potential @xmath30 is chosen in such a way as to preserve gauge invariance ; this way the longitudinal mode disappears and instabilities are avoided .",
    "+ similarly , kanno et al @xcite consider a vector field lagrangian of the type [ ] l_vector =- f^2()f^f _ , but in a basic scalar field driven inflation model . very recently , in @xcite the linear perturbations in these kind of models have been investigated .",

    "in particular , the structure of the interaction hamiltonian is independent of the functional dependence of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and determines the general form of and the anisotropy coefficients appearing in the final `` non - abelian '' expressions ( see sec .  4 ) .",

    "a parametrization was adopted as in ( [ l ] ) in order to keep the analysis more general and given that , because of the instability issues , introducing this degree of freedom into the theory requires special attention .",

    "this case is known to be affected by quantum instabilities in the longitudinal mode , anyway we choose @xmath74 for the sake of simplicity in our presentation .",

    "+ the amplitude of non - gaussianity has been presented through the parameters @xmath159 and @xmath160 ; in particular we have show the dependence of these functions from the non - angular parameters of the theory . we have provided the comparisons among the different ( scalar versus vector , abelian versus non - abelian ) contributions to @xmath159 and @xmath160 , noticing that any one of them can be the dominant contribution depending on the selected region of parameter space .",
    "in particular , we have stressed how the anisotropic contributions to the bispectrum and the trispectrum can overcome the isotropic parts .",
    "an interesting feature of these models is that the bispectrum and the trispectrum depend on the same set of parameters and their amplitudes are therefore strictly related to one another .",
    "+ we have presented the shapes of both the bispectrum and the trispectrum .",
    "the isotropic functions appearing in their final expressions had been analyzed separately from their anisotropy coefficients .",
    "the bispectrum isotropic functions had been found to preferably show a local shape .",
    "the trispectrum ones had been plotted selecting equilateral and specialized planar configurations .",
    "the full expressions ( i.e. complete of their anisotropy coefficients ) of bispectrum and trispectrum have been presented in specific momenta configuration , in order to provide a hint of the modulation of shapes and amplitudes operated by anisotropy .",
    "+ we have reviewed old and recent vector field models , indicating both their limits and achievements .",
    "we would like to stress that , in our view , the most promising features of these models consists in the possibility of providing both non - gaussianity and statistical anisotropy predictions that are related to one another because of the fact that they share the same underlying theory .",
    "this might , at some point in the future , become a great advantage : measurements of non - gaussianity could be used to constrain statistical anisotropy or viceversa .",
