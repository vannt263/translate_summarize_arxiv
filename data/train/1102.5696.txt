    "recently , a new state of matter , the topological insulator , attracts much theoretical and experimental attention.@xcite it has an electronic structure dominated by the spin - orbit coupling , which is a band insulator with a well - defined gap in the bulk but can host an odd number of dirac cones protected by time reversal symmetry on the surface.@xcite the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling makes it promising for spintronics applications.@xcite the proximity induced superconducting state on the topological insulator surface by a deposited superconductor was proposed to create majorana fermions@xcite , which may provide a new way to realize the topological quantum computation.@xcite lately , the realization of a superconducting state in a typical topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 by intercalating cu between adjacent quintuple units ( cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) makes the system even more attractive.@xcite the large diamagnetic response shows that the pairing is mainly of bulk character . in another topological insulator bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , the application of a high pressure also turns the material into a superconducting state.@xcite    since the superconductivity is bulk and intrinsic to the material , if zero energy surface majorana fermion mode exists , it would be easier to manipulate as compared to that induced by proximity effect , as it would not experience the interface roughness or mismatch common to a junction type device .",
    "possible nontrivial odd - parity pairing in cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is proposed and analyzed by fu and berg.@xcite it was argued that only if a bulk gap opens and the bulk pairing is odd in parity , would zero energy andreev bound states appear in the surface spectrum .",
    "however , their analysis was concentrated on the case when the chemical potential is much larger than the gap and the topological surface states are already merged into the continuum conduction band .",
    "a similar analysis was put forward by sato.@xcite    despite the above works , a detailed theoretical analysis of surface spectrum in the superconducting phase arising from a topological insulator is still lacking . in particular , not much is reported for the situation when the chemical potential is only slightly larger than the insulating gap and both topological surface states ( or , the surface conduction band@xcite ) and the continuum bulk conduction band are present but separated . since the surface spectrum is central to the topological properties of a material both in the normal and in the superconducting state , which is also directly accessible by experimental techniques as arpes@xcite and stm@xcite , it is highly desirable to make a detailed study of them .",
    "this will help to understand better superconductivity in systems with nontrivial topological band structure .",
    "we focus on two questions in this paper .",
    "one is the effect of superconducting pairing on the topological surface states@xcite present in the normal state .",
    "the other is the existence of surface andreev bound states .",
    "we have noticed that two different models@xcite are often used in - discriminatively in literature .",
    "they have the same normal state energy spectra but may be different in the superconducting state .",
    "we thus present our results for both of them .",
    "what happens to the topological surface states when pairing is introduced in the bulk depends on the orbital character of the topological surface state and on the bulk pairing symmetry .",
    "only when the continuum part of the band opens a full gap and the topological surface states , while separated from the bulk conduction band , do not open a gap for an odd - parity pairing , would a gapless andreev bound state appear .",
    "we find that the orbital characters of the topological surface states are different for the two models . for a certain bulk pairing symmetry , it is possible that the topological surface states of one model opens a gap while that of the other model is still intact .",
    "the existence of andreev bound states , the most important indication of nontrivial topological order in the superconducting phase , is thus expected to be also related to the orbital character of the topological surface states .",
    "we show that the interplay between the continuum bulk conduction band and the topological surface states produces a ring or a segment of zero energy states in addition to the andreev bound states depending on the symmetry of bulk pairing order parameters .",
    "in the following , when we talk about topological insulators , we would be mainly referring to bi@xmath3se@xmath4 , which shows a well defined dirac cone structure for the topological surface states.@xcite the model we consider below could be easily generalized to study other topological insulators like tlbise@xmath3@xcite and bi@xmath0te@xmath0se@xcite .",
    "the band structure of cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is similar to that of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , the most essential part of which consists of two @xmath5 orbitals on the top and bottom se layers hybridized with neighboring bi @xmath5 orbitals , in each quintuple bi@xmath0se@xmath1 unit.@xcite in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the normal state has four degrees of freedom .",
    "label the two orbitals concentrating mainly on the top and bottom ( seeing along the @xmath6 direction ) se layer of the various bi@xmath3se@xmath4 quintuple units as the first and second orbital , the basis is taken as @xmath7=[@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "the models could be written compactly in the following matrix form@xcite @xmath13 i@xmath14 is the fourth order unit matrix , giving rise to a topologically trivial shift of the energy bands and would be neglected in most of our following analysis . in terms of the two by two pauli matrices @xmath15",

    "some papers adopt the bonding and antibonding states of the two orbitals defined above as the orbital basis.@xcite the corresponding models could be obtained in terms of a simple unitary transformation performed in the orbital subspace .",
    "note that , the two different models give the same bulk band dispersion @xmath28=@xmath29 , with each of two eigen - energies two fold kramers degenerate due to the time reversal symmetry and the inversion symmetry of the model .",
    "however , we will show in the following that they are essentially two physically distinct models .    for the coefficients",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , there are different possible parameterizations which coincide with each other close to the @xmath33 point.@xcite without loss of generality , we take the parameterizations of wang _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "since the diagonal term @xmath30 proportional to the unit matrix does not affect the topological characters , it is ignored here .",
    "the system is defined on a hypothetical bilayer hexagonal lattice stacked along the @xmath34-axis , respecting the in plane hexagonal symmetry of the original bi@xmath0se@xmath1 lattice . with the three independent in - plane",
    "nearest neighbor unit vectors defined as @xmath35=(@xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , @xmath38=(-@xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , and @xmath39=(0 , -1 ) , we have @xmath40=@xmath41 , @xmath42=2@xmath43 , @xmath44=2@xmath45 , and @xmath46=@xmath47 .",
    "the in - plane and out - of - plane lattice parameters@xcite are taken as length units in the above expression , that is @xmath48=@xmath49=1 .",

    "_ et al.__@xcite describe qualitatively the same physics . with this parametrization , it is easy to see that the model has the inversion symmetry @xmath54=@xmath55 , where the inversion operator is defined as @xmath56=@xmath57.@xcite now , we clarify the differences between models ( i ) and ( ii ) by their surface states , which is one of the most important signatures of nontrivial topological order in the system .",
    "close to the @xmath33 point in the bz , we take @xmath58=@xmath59 , in which @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . consider a sample occupying the lower half space @xmath63 . the possible surface states localized close to @xmath64",
    "is searched by solving a set of four coupled second order differential equations @xmath65 together with the open boundary condition @xmath66=@xmath67=0.@xcite @xmath68 is the four - component eigenvector and e is the energy of the surface mode , respectively .",
    "we look for the zero energy states and hence set @xmath69=0.@xcite    for the model ( i ) with @xmath70=@xmath71@xmath72@xmath73 , the up and down spin degrees of freedom are decoupled from each other . the wave function could thus be written as @xmath68=@xmath74^{t}$]=@xmath75^{t}$ ] .",
    "the two spin components of the zero energy mode satisfy the same equation as ( @xmath76 is @xmath77 or @xmath78 for the two spin degrees of freedom ) @xmath79 \\chi_{s}(z)=0.\\ ] ] the two degenerate zero energy surface modes for @xmath34@xmath800 are obtained as @xmath81 where @xmath82=1 or 2 , @xmath83 is a normalization constant and @xmath84=@xmath85 .",
    "1/re@xmath86 $ ] ( ` re ' means taking the real part of a number ) are the two penetration depths of the surface modes into the bulk .",
    "the two unit vectors are @xmath87=@xmath88 and @xmath89=@xmath90 , where @xmath91 is one for @xmath82=@xmath92 and zero otherwise .",
    "take @xmath93 as the two basis , the effective model for the surface states are obtained by considering the k@xmath2 and k@xmath94 dependent terms in the original model as perturbations , which are @xmath95 suppose the two basis are normalized , the effective model for the surface states is@xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the first and second pauli matrices . since the two basis both have definite spin characters , @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the above equation could also be considered as acting in the spin subspace .",
    "the most salient feature of this model is that the corresponding surface states has contributions only from the first orbital .",
    "when we consider a sample occupying @xmath34@xmath990 , the surface states at @xmath34=0 would arise only from the second orbital .",
    "we now study model ( ii ) for @xmath25=@xmath100@xmath72@xmath101 .",
    "we still consider a sample situated at @xmath34@xmath800 with the open boundary conditions .",
    "following exactly the same steps as for the first model , we obtain the two degenerate zero energy surface states as @xmath102 where @xmath82=1 or 2 , @xmath83 is a normalization constant and @xmath103 are defined identically as above .",
    "however , the two unit basis vectors are quite different from the first model and are @xmath104=@xmath105^{t}$ ] and @xmath106=@xmath107^{t}$ ] .",
    "the two dimensional effective model for the surface states is also a bit different at least formally , which is @xmath108 the pauli matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 act in the two fold degenerate basis of the zero energy surface states which both have definite spin characters . for a general two dimensional wave vector , the surface state would be a linear combination of all the four spin - orbital basis .",
    "thus there are qualitative differences between two models which were used in - discriminatively in the literature for bi@xmath0se@xmath1.@xcite while only one orbital contributes to the surface states for model ( i ) , both two orbitals contribute in equal weight to the surface states for model ( ii ) . on the other hand , the effective model of the surface states",
    "has the same spin - orbital coupled form as the linear @xmath109 and @xmath110 terms in the original three dimensional model for model ( i ) .",
    "however , the effective model is changed from @xmath111 to @xmath112 for model ( ii ) .",
    "we have verified that , if we change the in - plane spin - orbit coupling of the two models ( i ) and ( ii ) from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , the resulting effective model of the surface states would have the form @xmath112 for model ( i ) but will be switched to @xmath111 for model ( ii ) .    before ending this section",
    ", we would like to point out that both the @xmath113-linear term in @xmath46 and the @xmath113-square term in @xmath40 are essential to obtain the zero energy surface modes .",
    "if we omit the @xmath114 term in @xmath40 , it is easy to verify that the gapless surface states no longer exist .",
    "this is related to the fact that band inversion is essential to the appearance of nontrivial topological surface states@xcite , which can only occur in the presence of @xmath114 term for @xmath109=@xmath110=0 .",
    "the realization of the superconducting state in cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1@xcite has brought about excitement that non - trivial topological superconducting state might be realized in this system , in which topologically protected gapless surface states traverse the bulk superconducting gap.@xcite the recent realization of superconducting phase in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 under high pressure@xcite makes the bi@xmath0x@xmath1 ( x is se or te ) material a very promising candidate system to realize topologically nontrivial superconducting phases.@xcite    the normal state of the topological insulator is marked by the presence of topological surface states inside the bulk gap .",
    "these gapless topological surface states are well separated from the bulk conduction band at low energies and become indistinguishable for energies much higher than the conduction band minimum . depending on the doped charge density the superconducting state could occur with the chemical potential either deep in the bulk conduction band or in the intermediate region where the topological surface states are well separated from the bulk conduction band@xcite . in the latter case , the coupling between the continuum bulk states and the isolated topological surface states may cause some new interesting phenomena .",
    "thus this intermediate region is where we will concentrate on below .",
    "furthermore , the actual pairing symmetries of the superconducting cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 are presently unknown.@xcite thus we will examine cases with different pairing symmetries in the hope to provide clues to identify the pairing symmetry and the role contributed by the topological surface states .    in the following , we will study the surface spectral function to see possible nontrivial topological properties arising from the normal phase topological order which is subject to a certain bulk pairing .",
    "the surface spectral function , which could be obtained from the surface green s function , has been studied by arpes@xcite and stm@xcite to give important information on the topological properties of the system . in the superconducting state",
    ", we expect to see some surface andreev bound states if a certain superconducting order is realized in the material .    in the presence of a surface perpendicular to the @xmath34-axis , @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "are good quantum numbers , and @xmath113 is replaced by @xmath115 as we shall search for surface states .",
    "we then discretize the @xmath34 coordinate and turn the whole sample ( @xmath34@xmath800 ) with a surface at @xmath34=0 to a coupled quintuple - layer system .",

    "now introduce superconducting pairing and define the nambu basis as @xmath133=@xmath134 $ ] .",

    "we have found no difference between the results obtained in terms of different iteration schemes .    after the retarded green s functions are at hand , the spectral function is obtained as @xmath156",
    "since we have now two orbital and two spin degrees of freedom , there are many possible pairing channels for different possible pairing mechanisms .",
    "realistic theoretical determination of the pairing symmetry requires the knowledge of pairing mechanism and reasonable parameter values , which are both lacking presently.@xcite here we will consider singlet and triplet pairing orders as phenomenological input parameters .",
    "their qualitative differences in spectral functions could help to identify the pairing symmetry from experiments .      before presenting the full spectral function ,",
    "we first would like to examine what happens to the topological surface states inherited from the normal state@xcite upon the formation of a certain bulk pairing .",

    "2(b ) , the continuum part of the spectrum even nearly closes at some special wave vectors for certain parameters .",
    "another interesting feature is the strong redistribution of spectral weight between the continuum conduction band and the topological surface states .",
    "some weight in the bulk conduction band part of the surface spectrum above the chemical potential is depleted and transferred to the topological surface states below the chemical potential .",
