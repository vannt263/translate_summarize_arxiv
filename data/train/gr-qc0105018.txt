    "some of the predictions for primordial nucleosynthesis in a non - extensive setting have been analyzed before by some of us , using the asymptotic approach of the quantum distribution functions , see refs .",
    "@xcite . here , instead , we shall consistently continue within the formalism given in paper i. since this approach is simpler , we shall obtain analytical results far beyond the point where previous works have reached , see for instance ref .",
    "together with paper i , we shall then provide a complete history of the early universe , accordingly modified taking into account a non - extensive setting . in this paper",
    ", we shall focus on the study of the changes that non - extensive statistics introduces in the principle of detailed balance , for which we provide a detailed analysis , both numerical and analytical .",
    "we shall then enhance the study presented in @xcite , by framing it in a larger picture which encompasses an smaller number of approximations and a larger number of predictions .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis was recently used as well to demonstrate that macroscopic samples of neutrinos in thermal equilibrium are indeed distributed according to fermi - dirac statistics @xcite .",
    "these latter authors considered that neutrinos were distributed by a bose - einstein statistics , and established bounds ( not very restrictive though ) upon this unexpected possibility .",
    "it is interesting to compare with our case : we assume that neutrinos are indeed 1/2 particles , as a large amount of data coming from particles accelerators show , but that even when continuing being fermions , and fulfilling the pauli s exclusion principle , their distribution functions could slightly deviate from an exact fermi - dirac one .    since we have provided a detailed account of non - extensive statistics , and the reasons why we choose the analytical form of the quantum distribution functions we adopted ( together with its derivation ) in paper i",
    ", we shall skip such topics here .",
    "we have also considered in paper i some physical reasons why to expect that boltzmann - gibbs distribution functions could be considered as an approximation .",
    "the same is valid for citations to previous works , for which we adopted here the criterion to quote just those needed for the explicit computations we are carrying on .",
    "this does not mean that our references are the only works in cosmological applications of non - extensivity , but only that for proper citation of some of the others , we refer the reader to paper i.    the layout of this work is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the basics of the neutron to proton ratio in an evolving universe .",
    "this section does not use much the fact that we are immersed in a non - extensive setting , but just presents general results which are valid disregarding the statistical mechanics used .",
    "indeed , the derivation being presented in section 2 was already given by others @xcite , and we provide it here just for the ease of discussion . in sections 3 - 7 we give the details of the analysis of the principle of detailed balance , and show how to obtain a priori results on the possible range of physically admitted values of @xmath0 without the need to compare with experiments .",
    "much of it is done in an analytical form , some is solved numerically . in section 8 , we present a detailed comparison between the two situations ( full and approximate cases ) that we found possible for the principle of detailed balance . towards the end of this latter section",
    "we provide a comparison with the latest data available . in section 9",
    "we compute , for the first time in a non - extensive framework , which is the modified capture time , the time in which neutrons are captured into deuterons . using this result we are able to compute the primordial abundance of @xmath1he with a greater degree of precision than that obtained in all previous works .",
    "we show that there are non - linear effects introduced by the appearance of a slight non - extensivity .",
    "finally , we give some general discussion in our concluding remarks .",
    "we begin by turning again to the issue of the evolution of the neutron abundance as the universe evolves .",
    "we shall base this discussion in the work by , bernstein , brown and feimberg @xcite . as we have done before , we shall denote by @xmath2 the rate for the weak processes to convert protons into neutrons and by @xmath3 the rate for the reverse ones @xcite .",

    "7 and 8 are worth doing .",
    "firstly , note that the dependence of the @xmath1he abundance , when neutron free decay is taken into account , is no longer linear as it was before , see for instance eq .",
    "( [ eq : yqp ] ) .",
    "this makes the study of the nucleosynthesis process much more interesting , and the use of the full numerical code a worth doing task .",

    "secondly , it appears that for a given value of @xmath308 ( and @xmath309 ) there are two values of @xmath0 that could fit well the observations .",
    "finally note that the y - axis of fig .",

    "8 ( right panel ) we show for the first time the dependence of the @xmath1he abundance as a function of @xmath251 , for different @xmath0-values .",
    "the general trend of an increasing abundance as a function of @xmath309 is maintained , but for different values of @xmath198 , the curves cross the current constraints in different positions .",
    "this plot actually represents a 3d problem , with a two parameter space .",
    "the influence of @xmath309 appears when numerically solving the equation for @xmath293 .",
    "indeed , the computation of the correction to the value of @xmath308 in the full analytical treatment presented here has to take into account different contributions .",
    "a direct linear dependence on @xmath0 is within the time - temperature relationship ( see the first equations in this section , especially eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttrel ] ) ) and in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yqp ] ) .",
    "in addition , we can see that if @xmath293 is smaller than in the standard case , then @xmath311 will be bigger , and @xmath213 will be smaller than their respective standard counterparts .",
    "thus , @xmath312 will in turn be bigger , what happens for instance in the case of a negative value of @xmath0 , and this would provide a bigger @xmath308 . however , the linear correction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yqp ] ) is competing with that positive deviation ; this is what finally makes the curve to deviate from a straight line .",
    "in this paper , based on previous works ( paper i ) , we have revisited the problem of the primordial genesis of light elements within the framework of non - extensive statistics .",
    "we have particularly paid attention to the form of the principle of detailed balance that is valid in this new setting .",
    "we have shown that its usual form is no longer valid , but instead , that it is just an approximation , dubbed here as the bst .",
    "the full , new form of the principle of detailed balance was derived and named as bne , and we have studied it in detail too . by doing so , we were able to disguise the range of validity of previous approaches to the topic , and to formally see the origin and range of the deviations between the standard and non - extensive scenarios for the primordial production of elements .",
    "we have also analyzed the neutron free decay correction to the capture time , and found that even when considering a first ( linear ) order correction in the quantum distribution functions , the final output can not be reduced to a linear correction in the abundances , as fig .",
    "8 explicitly show . by comparing with the latest observational data , we have obtained a new bound on the upper limit of the parameter @xmath200 .",
    "we think that the bound being presented here ( referring also to figs . 7 and 8)",
    "is obtained within a much more detailed basis than the previous ones , see for instance @xcite , and then that this bound should be considered as the more reliable of them all .",
    "indeed , we believe that the only way to improve it is to go to a direct implementation of the primordial nucleosynthesis code . by doing",
    "so we would have the possibility of studying the modifications to the abundances of all light elements in a simultaneous way .",
    "this further extension is currently under analysis .      to have a rough idea of the order of magnitude of the function @xmath294",
    ", we need to compute @xmath313 in the range of temperatures we are interested in , with @xmath314 and @xmath234 .",
    "firstly , we note that for this purpose it is enough to consider the standard values of all these quantities .",
    "this is because non - extensive effects here would introduce only second order corrections in @xmath0 , that we are disregarding in our computation .",
    "recalling the relation @xmath315 , we see that in order to estimate the values of @xmath313 we need to know the abundances @xmath316 . then , to get @xmath294 , we have made the following steps :    1 .   using the time - temperature relation",
    "we can put @xmath317 as an explicit function of @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath318 follows , as well as @xmath319 .",
    "2 .   considering @xmath318 together with the obtainable function @xmath320 ( remember that @xmath321 ) , and imposing the ( approximate ) constrain @xmath322 , we get the values of @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
