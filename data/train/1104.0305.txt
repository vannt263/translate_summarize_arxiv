    "experimental data have consistently revealed that the neuronal connection weight , which models the efficacy of the firing of a pre - synaptic neuron in modulating the state of a post - synaptic one , varies on short time scales , ranging from hundreds to thousands of milliseconds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is called short - term plasticity ( stp ) .",
    "two types of stp , with opposite effects on the connection efficacy , have been observed .",
    "they are short - term depression ( std ) and short - term facilitation ( stf ) .",
    "std is caused by the depletion of available resources when neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal of the pre - synaptic neuron during signal transmission @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , stf is caused by the influx of calcium into the presynaptic terminal after spike generation , which increases the probability of releasing neurotransmitters .",
    "computational studies on the impact of stp on network dynamics have strongly suggested that stp can play many important roles in neural computation .",
    "for instance , cortical neurons receive pre - synaptic signals with firing rates ranging from less than 1 to more than 200 hertz .",
    "it was suggested that std provides a dynamic gain control mechanism that allows equal fractional changes on rapidly and slowly firing afferents to produce post - synaptic responses , realizing weber s law @xcite .",
    "besides , computations can be performed in recurrent networks by population spikes in response to external inputs , which are enabled through std by recurrent connections @xcite .    another role played by synaptic depression",
    "was proposed by levina , herrmann , and giesel ( 2007 ) . in neuronal systems , critical avalanches",
    "are believed to bring about optimal computational capabilities , and are observed experimentally .",
    "synaptic depression enables a feedback mechanism so that the system can be maintained at a critical state , making the self - organized critical behavior robust @xcite .",
    "herding , a computational algorithm reminiscent of the neuronal dynamics with synaptic depression , was recently found to have a similar effect on the complexity of information processing @xcite .",
    "stp was also recently thought to play a role in the way a neuron estimates the membrane potential information of the pre - synaptic neuron based on the spikes it receives @xcite .    concerning the computational significance of stf , a recent work proposed an interesting idea for achieving working memory in the prefrontal cortex @xcite .",
    "the residual calcium of stf is used as a buffer to facilitate synaptic connections , so that inputs in a subsequent delay period can be used to retrieve the information encoded by the facilitated synaptic connections .",
    "the stf - based memory mechanism has the advantage of not having to rely on persistent neural firing during the time the working memory is functioning , and hence is energetically more efficient .    from the computational point of view",
    ", the time scale of stp resides between fast neural signaling ( in the order of milliseconds ) and rapid learning ( in the order of minutes or above ) , which is the time scale of many important temporal processes occurring in our daily lives , such as the passive holding of a temporal memory of objects coming into our visual field ( the so - called iconic sensory memory ) , or the active use of the memory trace of recent events for motion control .",
    "thus , stp may serve as a substrate for neural systems manipulating temporal information on the relevant time scales .",
    "stp has been observed in many parts of the cortex , and also exhibits large diversity in different cortical areas , suggesting that the brain may employ a strategy of weighting std and stf differently depending on the computational purpose .    in the present study",
    ", we explore the potential roles of stp in processing information derived from external stimuli , an issue of fundamental importance yet inadequately investigated so far .",
    "for ease of exposition , we use continuous attractor neural networks ( canns ) as our working model , but our main results are qualitatively applicable to general cases .",
    "canns are recurrent networks that can hold a continuous family of localized active states  @xcite .",
    "neutral stability is a key property of canns , which enables neural systems to update memory states easily and to track time - varying stimuli smoothly .",
    "canns have been successfully applied to describe the generation of persistent neural activities @xcite , the encoding of continuous stimuli such as the orientation , the head direction and the spatial location of objects @xcite , and a framework for implementing efficient population decoding  @xcite .    when stp is included in a cann , the dynamics of the network",
    "is governed by two time scales .",
    "the time constant of stp is much slower than that of neural signaling ( 100 - 1000 ms vs. 1 - 10 ms ) .",
    "the interplay between the fast and the slow dynamics causes the network to exhibit rich dynamical behaviors , laying the foundation for the neural system to implement complicated functions .    in canns with std , various intrinsic behaviors",
    "have been reported , including damped oscillations @xcite , periodic and aperiodic dynamics @xcite , state hopping with transient population spikes @xcite , traveling fronts and pulses @xcite , breathers and pulse - emitting breathers @xcite , spiral waves @xcite , rotating bump states @xcite , and self - sustained non - periodic activities @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on those network states relevant to the processing of stimuli in canns , including static , moving and metastatic bumps @xcite . more significantly",
    ", we find that with std , the network state can display slow - decaying plateau behaviors , i.e. , the network that is initially being stimulated to an active state by a transient input decays to the silent state very slowly on the time scale of std relaxation , rather than on the time scale of neural signaling .",
    "this is a very interesting property .",
    "it implies that std can provide a way for the neural system to maintain sensory memory for a duration unachievable by the signaling of single neurons , and shut off the network activity of sensory memory naturally .",
    "the latter has once been a challenging technical issue in the study of theoretical neuroscience @xcite .    with stf ,",
    "neuronal connections become strengthened during the presence of an external stimulus .",
    "this stimulus - specific facilitation lasts for a period on the time scale of stf , and provides a way for the neural system to hold a memory trace of external inputs @xcite .",
    "this information can be used by the neural system for various computational tasks . to demonstrate this idea , we consider canns as a framework for implementing population decoding @xcite . in the presence of stf",
    ", the network response is determined not only by the instant input value but also by the history of external inputs ( the latter being mediated by the facilitated neuronal interactions ) .",
    "therefore , temporal fluctuations in external inputs can be largely averaged out , leading to improved decoding results .    in general ,",
    "std and stf tend to have opposite effects on network dynamics @xcite .",
    "the former increases the mobility of network states , whereas the latter increases their stability .",
    "enhanced mobility and stability can contribute positively to different computational tasks .",
    "enhanced stability mediated by stf can improve the computational and behavioral stability of canns . to demonstrate that enhanced mobility does have a positive role in information processing",
    ", we investigate a computational task in which the network tracks time - varying stimuli .",
    "we find that std increases the tracking speed of a cann .",
    "interestingly , for strong std , the network state can even overtake the moving stimulus , reminiscent of the anticipative responses of head - direction and place cells @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . after introducing the models and methods in section 2 , we discuss the intrinsic properties of canns in the absence of external stimuli by studying their phase diagram in section 3 . in sections 4 to 6",
    ", we study the network behavior in the presence of various stimuli . in section 4 ,",
    "we consider the after - effects of a transient stimulus , and find that sensory memories can persist for a desirable duration and then decay gracefully . in section 5 , we consider the response of the network to a noisy stimulus , and find that the accuracy in population decoding can be enhanced . in section 6 , we consider the response of the network to a moving stimulus , and find that the tracking performance is improved by the enhanced mobility of the network states .",
    "the paper ends with conclusions and discussions in section 7 .",
    "our preliminary results on the effects of std have been reported in fung , wong , wang , and wu ( 2010 ) .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional continuous stimulus @xmath0 encoded by an ensemble of neurons .",
    "for example , the stimulus may represent a moving direction , an orientation or a general continuous feature of objects extracted by the neural system .",
    "we consider the case where the range of possible values of the stimulus is much larger than the range of neuronal interactions .",
    "we can thus effectively take @xmath1 in our analysis . in simulations , however , we will set the stimulus range to be @xmath2 , and have @xmath3 neurons uniformly distributed in the range obeying a periodic boundary condition .",
    "let @xmath4 be the current at time @xmath5 in the neurons whose preferred stimulus is @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath4 is determined by the external input @xmath6 , the network input from other neurons , and its own relaxation .",

    "@xmath10 is the firing rate of neurons , which increases with the synaptic input , but saturates in the presence of global activity - dependent inhibition .",
    "a solvable model that captures these features is given by deneve , latham , and pouget ( 1999 ) and wu , amari , and nakahara ( 2002 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a positive constant controlling the strength of global inhibition and @xmath13 is a constant whose dimension is @xmath14 .",
    "this type of global inhibition can be achieved by shunting inhibition @xcite .",

    "we only need to consider the effect of stf . note , however , that the terms  high frequency limit \" and  low frequency limit \" are used figuratively .",
    "the actual limits should depend on the other parameters mentioned above .",
    "our theoretical analysis of the network dynamics is based on the observations that : 1 ) the stationary states of the network , as well as the profile of stp across all neurons , can be well approximated as gaussian - shaped bumps ; and 2 ) the state change of the network , and hence the profile of stp , can be well described by distortions of the gaussian bump in various forms .",
    "we can therefore use a perturbation approach developed by fung , wong , and wu ( 2010 ) to solve the network dynamics analytically .",
    "it is instructive for us to first review the network dynamics when no stp is included .",
    "this is done by setting @xmath38 in eq .",

    "fung , wong , and wu ( 2010 ) have shown that the wave functions of the quantum harmonic oscillators can well describe the different distortion modes of a bump state .",
    "for instance , during the process of tracking an external stimulus , the synaptic input @xmath4 can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the wavefunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator ( fig .",
    "[ basis - functions ] ) , @xmath52      \\left(\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^n      \\exp\\left[-{\\frac { ( x - z)^2 } { 2a^2}}\\right ] , ~~n=0,1,\\ldots .",
    "\\label{eq : un}\\ ] ] these functions have clear physical meanings , corresponding to distortions in the height , position , width , skewness and other higher order features of the gaussian bump ( see fig .",
    "[ basis - functions ] ) .",
    "we can use a perturbation approach to solve the network dynamics effectively , with each distortion mode characterized by an eigenvalue determining its rate of evolution in time .",
    "a key property of canns is that the translational mode has a zero eigenvalue , and all other distortion modes have negative eigenvalues for @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that the gaussian bumps are able to track changes in the position of the external stimuli by continuously shifting the position of the bumps , with other distortion modes affecting the tracking process only in the transients .",
    "an example of the tracking process is shown in fig .",

    "we will only present the detailed analysis to the case of std .",
    "extension to the case of stf is straightforward .",
    "similar to the synaptic input @xmath4 , the profile of std can be expanded in terms of the distortion modes , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is given by @xmath67}\\left(\\frac{d}{dx}\\right)^n    \\exp{\\left[-\\frac{(x - z)^2}{a^2}\\right]}.\\ ] ] note that the width of @xmath68 is @xmath69 times that of @xmath70 due to the appearance of @xmath71 in eq . .",

    "the details are presented in appendix b.    the peak position @xmath74 of the bump is determined from the self - consistent condition , @xmath75    truncating the perturbation expansion at increasingly high orders corresponds to the inclusion of increasingly complex distortions , and hence provides increasingly accurate descriptions of the network dynamics .",
    "as confirmed in the subsequent sections , the perturbative approach is in excellent agreement with simulation results .",
    "the agreement is especially remarkable when the std strength is weak , and the lowest few orders are already sufficient to explain the dynamical features .",
    "the agreement is less satisfactory when std is strong , and the perturbative approach typically over - estimates the stability of the moving bump .",
    "this is probably due to the considerable distortion of the gaussian profile of the synaptic depression when std is strong .",

    "this can be seen from the steady state solution of @xmath4 , @xmath86 the third term in the denominator of the integrand arises from std , and plays the role of a local inhibition that is strongest where the neurons are most active .",
    "hence we see that the silent state with @xmath87 is the only stable state when either @xmath88 or @xmath89 is large .",
    "when std is weak , the network behaves similarly to canns without std , that is , the static bump state is present up to @xmath88 near 1 .",
    "however , when @xmath89 increases , a state with the bump spontaneously moving at a constant velocity comes into existence .",
    "such moving states have been predicted in canns @xcite , and may be associated with the travelling wave behaviors widely observed in the neocortex  @xcite . at an intermediate range of @xmath89 , the static and moving states coexist , and the final state of the network depends on the initial condition . as @xmath89 increases further , static bumps disappear . in the limit of high @xmath89 ,",

    "the boundary of this region is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ phase - diagram - std ] .",
    "unfortunately , this line is not easily observed in numerical solutions since the static bump is unstable against fluctuations that are asymmetric with respect to its central position .",
    "although the bump is stable against symmetric fluctuations , asymmetric fluctuations can displace its position and eventually convert it to a moving bump .",
    "this will be considered in the first - order perturbation in the next subsection .",
    "when the network bump is moving , the profile of std is lagging behind due to its slow dynamics , and this induces an asymmetric distortion in the profile of std .",
    "[ phase - lag - std ] illustrates this behavior . comparing the static and moving bumps shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - lag - std](a ) and ( b ) , one can see that the profile of a moving bump is characterized by the synaptic depression lagging behind the moving bump .",

    ", the region of synaptic depression tends to follow the bump .",

    "the first - order analysis includes the displacement mode and asymmetry with respect to the bump peak , and hence can describe the onset of the moving phase .",

    "the second - order analysis further includes the width distortions , and hence improves the prediction of the boundary of the moving phase , as well as the lifetimes of the plateau states .",
    "higher - order perturbations are required to yield more accurate descriptions of results such as the overshooting in the tracking process .",
    "we anticipate that the perturbation analysis will also be useful in many other population decoding problems , such as in quantifying the deformation of tuning curves due to neural adaptation @xcite .",
    "more importantly , our work reveals a number of interesting behaviors which may have far - reaching implications in neural computation .",
    "first , std endows canns with slow - decaying behaviors .",
    "when a network is initially stimulated to an active state by an external input , it will decay to the silent state very slowly after the input is removed .",
    "the duration of the plateau is of the time scale of std rather than of neural signaling .",
    "this provides a way for the network to hold the stimulus information for up to hundreds of milliseconds , if the network operates in the parameter regime where the bumps are marginally unstable .",
    "this property is , on the other hand , extremely difficult to implement in attractor networks without std . in a cann without std , an active state of the network",
    "will either decay to the silent state exponentially fast or be retained forever , depending on the initial activity level of the network .",
    "indeed , how to shut off the activity of a cann gracefully has been a challenging issue that has received wide attention in theoretical neuroscience , with researchers suggesting that a strong external input either in the form of inhibition or excitation must be applied ( see , e.g. , gutkin , laing , colby , chow , and ermentrout ( 2001 ) ) . here",
    ", we have shown that in certain circumstances , std can provide a mechanism for closing down network activities naturally and after a desirable duration .",
    "taking into account the time scale of std ( in the order of @xmath173 ms ) and the passive nature of its dynamics , the std - based memory is most likely associated with the sensory memory of the brain , e.g. , the iconic and the echoic memories @xcite .",
    "second , with std , canns can support both static and moving bumps .",
    "static bumps exist only when the synaptic depression is sufficiently weak .",
    "a consequence of synaptic depression is that static bumps are placed in the metastatic state , so that its response to changing stimuli is speeded up , enhancing its tracking performance .",
    "the states of moving bumps may be associated with the travelling wave behaviors widely observed in the neurocortex .",
    "we have also observed that for strong std , the network state can even overtake the moving stimulus , reminiscent of the anticipative responses of head - direction and place cells  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this occurs in the parameter range where the network holds spontaneous moving bump solutions , suggesting that travelling wave phenomena may be closely related to the predicting capacity of neural systems .",
    "third , stf improves the decoding accuracy of canns .",
    "when an external stimulus is presented , stf strengthens the interactions among neurons which are tuned to the stimulus .",
    "this stimulus - specific facilitation provides a mechanism for the network to hold a memory trace of external inputs up to the time scale of stf , and this information can be used by the neural system for executing various memory - based operations , such as operating the working memory .",
    "we have tested this idea in a population decoding task , and found that the error is indeed decreased .",
    "this is due to the determination of the network response by both the instantaneous value and the history of external inputs , which effectively averages out temporal fluctuations .",
    "these computational advantages of dynamical synapses lead to the following implications for the modeling of neural systems .",
    "first , it sheds some light on the long - standing debate in the field about the instability of canns in the presence of noise .",
    "two aspects of instability have been identified @xcite .",
    "one is the structural instability , which refers to the argument that network components in reality , such as the neuronal synapses , are unlikely to be as perfect as mathematically required in canns .",
    "a small amount of discrepancy in the network structure can destroy the state space considerably , destabilizing the bump state after the stimulus is removed .",
    "the other instability refers to the computational sensitivity of the network to input noises .",
    "because of neutral stability , the bump position is very susceptible to fluctuations in external inputs , rendering the network decoding unreliable .",
    "we have shown that stf can largely improve the computational robustness of canns by averaging out the temporal fluctuations in inputs .",
    "similarly , stf can overcome the structural susceptibility of canns .",
    "with stf , the neuronal connections around the bump area are strengthened temporally , which effectively stabilizes the bump on the time scale of stf @xcite .",
    "another mechanism in a similar spirit is the reduction of the inhibition strength around the bump area @xcite .",
    "second , std and stf should be dominant in different areas of the brain .",
    "we have investigated the impact of std and stf on the tracking performance of canns .",
    "there is , in general , a trade - off between the stability of bump states and the tracking performance of the network .",
    "std increases the mobility of bump states and hence the tracking speed of the network , whereas stf has the opposite effect .",
    "these differences predict that in cortical areas where time - varying stimuli , such as the head direction and the moving direction of objects , are encoded , std should have a stronger effect than stf .",
    "on the other hand , in cortical areas where the robustness of bump states , i.e. , the decoding accuracy of stimuli , is preferred , stf should have a stronger effect .",
    "third , std and stf consume different levels of energy and operate on different time scales .",
    "we have shown that both std and stf can generate temporal memories , but their ways of achieving it are quite different . in std",
    ", the memory is held in the prolonged neural activities , whereas in stf , it is in the facilitated neuronal connections .",
    "mongillo , barak , and tsodyks ( 2008 ) proposed that with stf , neurons may not even have to be active after the stimulus is removed .",
    "the facilitated neuronal connections , mediated by the elevated calcium residue , is sufficient to carry out the memory retrieval . in our model , this is equivalent to setting the network in the parameter regime without static bump solutions , or in the regime with static bump solutions but with the external stimulus presented for such a short time that neuronal interactions can not be fully facilitated .",
    "thus , taking into account the energy consumption associated with neural firing , the stf - based mechanism for short - term memory has the advantage of being economically efficient .",
    "however , the std - based one also has the desirable property of enabling the stimulus information to be propagated to other cortical areas , since neural firing is necessary for signal transmission , and this is critical in the early information pathways .",
    "furthermore , the time durations required for eliciting stf- and std - based memory are significantly different .",
    "the former needs a stimulus to be presented for an amount of time up to @xmath123 to facilitate neuronal interactions sufficiently ; whereas the latter simply requires a transient appearance of a stimulus .",
    "this difference implies that the two memory mechanisms may have potentially different applications in neural systems .    in summary",
    ", we have revealed that stp can play very valuable roles in neural information processing , including achieving temporal memory , improving decoding accuracy , enhancing tracking performance and stabilizing canns .",
    "we have also shown that std and stf tend to have different impacts on the network dynamics .",
    "these results , together with the fact that stp displays large diversity in the neural cortex , suggest that the brain may employ a strategy of weighting std and stf differentially depending on the computational task . in the present study , for the simplicity of analysis",
    ", we have only explored the effects of std and stp separately . in practice ,",
    "a proper combination of std and stp can make the network exhibit new and interesting behaviors and implement new and computationally desirable properties .",
    "for instance , a cann with both std and stf , and with the time scale of the former shorter than that of the latter , can hold bump states for a period of time before shifting the memory to facilitated neural connections .",
    "this enables the network to achieve both goals of conveying the stimulus information to other cortical areas and holding the memory cheaply .",
    "alternatively , the network may have the time scale of std longer than that of stf , so that the network can produce improved encoding results for external stimuli and also close down bump activities easily .",
    "we will explore these interesting issues in the future .",
    "we acknowledge the valuable comments of terry sejnowski on this work . this study is supported by the research grants council of hong kong ( grant numbers 604008 and 605010 ) and the 973 program of china ( grant number 2011cba00406 ) .",
