    "the colossal magnetoresistance phenomena discovered in the early 90 s in mixed - valent manganites has stimulated world - wide research activities on the subject during the last decade @xcite .",
    "intense research has revealed many new aspects of this complex material system , which now turn out to be basic to the physics of correlated many - body systems .",
    "several key phenomena observed in manganites , such as strong coupling among spin / charge / orbital degrees of freedom , competition among several order parameters , and the resulting inhomogeneous ground state , now appear to be broadly applicable to other correlated systems including high _ _ t__@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "early experimental and theoretical results that uncovered many exciting physical properties are discussed in many excellent review articles ( ramirez , 1997 @xcite ; coey , viret , and von molnar , 1999 @xcite ; tokura and tomioka , 1999 @xcite ) , and in several edited books ( rao and raveau , 1998 @xcite ; tokura , 1999 @xcite ; kaplan and mahanti 1999 @xcite ) .",
    "one of us ( swc ) also reviewed early experimental progress in 1998 and 1999 @xcite .",
    "early works on optical spectroscopy of the manganites were reviewed by noh , jung , and kim @xcite , okimoto and tokura @xcite , and cooper@xcite .",
    "an experimental overview of structure and transport of the manganites was prepared by salamon and jaime , 2001 @xcite and a theoretical review by dagotto , hotta , and moreo , 2001 @xcite on phase separation phenomena in manganites .    in this review ,",
    "we cover the extensive progress made in understanding these interesting systems in the last about three years , with emphasis on multi - scale phase modulation phenomena .",
    "we include our recent experimental results that provided unambiguous evidence for multiscale charge / lattice / orbital inhomogeneity and the concomitant phase separation phenomena in the manganites .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the basic physics underlying these effects , and a brief summary of earlier relevant progress in the physics of the manganite system .    roughly speaking , colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) results from a magnetic - field - induced shift of the ferromagnetic curie temperature , and the accompanying metal - insulator transition . the initial extensive research on the origin of cmr effect revealed two important aspects of the intriguing system .",
    "first , it appears that charge carriers in the mixed - valent manganites are ( jahn - teller - type ) polaronic . in other words , charge carriers in the _ _ e__@xmath4 band of mn@xmath5 tend to be localized by accompanying lattice distortions and to be strongly dressed by clouds of phonons .",
    "the lattice distortions accompanying the carriers probably resemble local jahn - teller distortions and the polaronic nature of charge carriers was much emphasized .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that the exact nature ( i.e. , metallic or insulating ) of the ground state of the many - polaron problem is still largely a mystery .",
    "the second important aspect , which is somewhat related to the jahn - teller polaron issue , is the unusually strong coupling among charge / spin / orbital degrees of freedom in manganites .",
    "for example , when charge carriers in the _",
    "_ e__@xmath4 orbital can hop readily from one mn site to another , the double exchange mechanism produces ferromagnetic coupling between localized _ _",
    "t__@xmath6 spins @xcite .",
    "however , when charge carriers tend to localize , superexchange coupling becomes active .",
    "it turns out that the magnitude as well as the sign of this superexchange coupling depends on the orbital character of the localized charge @xcite .",
    "for example , when the _",
    "_ e__@xmath4 orbital electron of mn@xmath5 faces the neighboring mn@xmath7 , the superexchange coupling between the mn@xmath5 and mn@xmath7 is ferromagnetic . otherwise , the superexchange coupling is antiferromagnetic .",
    "the prototypical manganite system is ca - doped lamno@xmath2 , where the concentration of mn@xmath7 is controlled by the doping level of ca@xmath8 into la@xmath5 sites .",
    "the general trend of physical properties with concentration variation of mn@xmath5 ( or mn@xmath7 ) can be summarized in the following way : ( 1 ) when there are more mn@xmath5 than mn@xmath7 ( i.e. , _ _ x__0.5 in la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 ) , the ground state tends to be metallic and ferromagnetic , probably induced by the double exchange mechanism .",
    "( 2 ) when there are more mn@xmath7 than mn@xmath5 ( i.e , _ _",
    "x__0.5 ) , the ground state often becomes charge - localized ( insulating ) and , in fact , charge - ordered with intriguing patterns .",
    "magnetic coupling in this insulator is dominated by superexchange coupling , which is sensitive to orbital ordering .",
    "( 3 ) surprisingly , high temperature properties differ strongly from those of the ground state . at high temperatures , systems with _ _",
    "x__0.5 tend to be more insulating than those with _ _ x__0.5 .",
    "for example , the ground state of la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 is ferromagnetic - metallic , but the system becomes insulating above the curie temperature .",
    "thus , we may conclude that the jahn - teller polaron nature is a controlling effect for _ _ x__0.5 at high temperatures .",
    "the details of these aspects are well discussed in various review papers 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 .",
    "recently , there has been an unexpected turn of events in manganite research .",
    "the steadily accumulating body of experimental results clearly indicates that the mixed - valent manganite system is electronically / magnetically inhomogeneous so that a hamiltonian approach may have severe limitations .",
    "this inhomogeneity appears at various length scales as well as time scales .",
    "trivial inhomogeneity such as chemical inhomogeneity through inappropriate synthesis of materials is partially responsible .",
    "however , there are non - trivial inhomogeneities not directly related to the origin of cmr effects .",
    "for example , in the low doping range with _",
    "_ x__@xmath110.1 and _ _ x__@xmath120.9 in la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath13 , the system is a weakly doped antiferromagnet , with a tendency to exhibit very - small - scale ( likely nano - scale ) phase mixtures of an antiferromagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "in fact , this is a general trend when carriers are introduced into antiferromagnetic ( especially , mott - type insulating ) oxides .",
    "there are , however , two important non - trivial inhomogeneities ( or phase modulations ) in mixed - valent manganites that can be relevant to cmr effects ; these cmr - related phase modulations are the main theme of this chapter .",
    "one non - trivial phase modulation occurs at low temperatures with micro - meter length scales .",
    "for example , in pr@xmath5-substituted la@xmath14ca@xmath15mno@xmath2 , ferromagnetic - metallic regions and charge - ordered insulating regions coexist at low temperatures with sub - micro - meter scales .",
    "the relative volume of the electronically / magnetically distinct regions varies with pr substitution .",
    "furthermore , this relative volume is sensitive to applied magnetic field ( favoring the ferromagnetic - metallic state ) , which leads to huge negative magnetoresistance .",
    "it turns out that long - range strain , resulting from the significantly - different crystallographic structures of the metallic and insulating phases , plays an important role in producing large - length - scale phase coexistence in the system .",
    "this tendency resembles what generally happens in martensitic phase transformations . in martensitic systems",
    ", crystallographically - different phases can coexist at low temperatures to accommodate the significant long - range strain associated with martensitic transformation .",
    "therefore , it appears that manganites are a wonderfully unique system in which martensitic effects and strongly - correlated physics both play critical roles .",
    "the other important inhomogeneity is related to the presence of nano - scale charge / orbital correlated nano - clusters ( or nano - scale charge / orbital ordering ) in the background paramagnetic state above the curie temperature .",
    "for example , above the curie temperature of 275 k in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 , nano - scale charge / orbital ordering has been observed .",
    "furthermore , the nano - scale charge / orbital ordering is correlated with the insulating nature of the system above the curie temperature .",
    "in fact , systematics of various manganites reveal that the insulating nature above the curie temperature is always associated with the presence of charge / orbital correlated nano - clusters , existing only in the orthorhombic crystallographic structure .",
    "the theoretical reexamination of the exact role of jahn - teller polarons as well as polaron - polaron correlations in the insulator above the curie temperature will be essential to understand the systematics .    to address the non - trivial phase modulations that are directly related to cmr properties in mixed - valent manganites , we organize this chapter as follows .",
    "a revisited phase diagram on ( la , ca)mno@xmath2 system covering high temperature structural transition boundaries is discussed in section sec2 .",
    "carrier - concentration - dependence of various electronic and thermal transport properties is also presented in this section to complete the phase diagram of this prototypical system . in section [ sec3 ] , new experimental findings are discussed , especially relating to the phase separation phenomena with sub - micro - meter scales at low temperature . we focus on the ( la , pr , ca)mno@xmath2 system produced with varying chemical pressure .",
    "magnetotransport , electron microscopy , and optical conductivity studies are used to investigate extensively the nature of the low temperature phase separation . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "high temperature - nanoscale phase modulations are explored in ( la , ca)mno@xmath2 systems using various experimental approaches such as electronic / thermal transport and optical conductivity measurements . section [ sec5 ] focuses on the nanoscale phase coexistence problem studied with _",

    "section [ sec6 ] concludes this chapter .",
    "the perovskite manganite ( la , ca)mno@xmath2 is a prototypical system that exhibits various ground states as a function of carrier concentration .",
    "the ca ionic size is almost identical to the la one , and thus a true solid solution forms in the entire range of ca concentrations with minimal disorder effects , which might come from a size mismatch of the a - site ions in the abo@xmath2 perovskite structure . by varying relative ratios of la and ca",
    ", we can explore the influence of carrier concentrations on the physical properties of this system .    to accurately obtain desired carrier concentrations ,",
    "a large number of polycrystalline la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 specimens with high density were prepared with similar synthesis conditions .",

    "the samples for _ _ x__@xmath120.2 were post - annealed in a flowing nitrogen gas , and the samples for _ _ x__@xmath120.8 in an oxygen for 12 - 60 hrs .",
    "a previous study has focused on low temperature phase diagram based on the detailed measurements of magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath18 ) ( or magnetization ) @xcite .",
    "the data were still incomplete to understand detailed phase diagram . in this study",
    ", we extended our measurements to resistivity ( @xmath19 ) , thermal conductivity ( @xmath20 ) and thermoelectric power ( _ s _ ) at low temperatures to determine doping - dependent variations of electronic ( charge ) and phononic ( lattice ) degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "in addition , to complete the phase diagram , we also determined structural phase transition temperatures as a function of ca concentrations through the high - temperature - dc resistivity measurements .",
    "high temperature @xmath19 was measured with a transport stick located inside a quartz tube in a furnace .",
    "temperature was measured with a pt and pt - rh thermocouple from 300 to @xmath121000 k. the thermocouple was pre - calibrated as a function of temperature . in each measurement",
    ", we used the conventional 4-probe technique with silver or gold pastes suitable for high temperature measurements .",
    "depending on the carrier concentration , care was taken to flow a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases so that oxygen stoichiometry of a sample does not change while measuring resistivity at high temperatures above @xmath12500 k. as explained above , when prepared in air , samples with _ _",
    "x__@xmath120.2 tend to absorb oxygen , while samples with _ _ x__@xmath120.8 are susceptible to oxygen deficiency .",

    "quite low @xmath20 observed at low temperatures in the charge - ordered samples , can be also attributed to long - range anisotropic lattice strains , resulting from the cooperative jahn - teller distortion and orbital ordering .",

    "x__=0.2 - 0.5 , provided that the lattice symmetry is of the orthorhombic@xmath233 type .",
    "interestingly , the correlations are not significantly affected by the nature of the low - temperature ordered state .",
    "in particular , very similar nanoscale correlations were found in pr@xmath30ca@xmath31mno@xmath2 which exhibits the ce - type order at low temperatures , and in la@xmath30ca@xmath31mno@xmath2 , which is a ferromagnetic metal @xcite .",
    "nanoscale structural correlations , therefore , appear to be a generic feature of the orthorhombic pi state in hole - doped manganites .    despite significant amount of research activity devoted to the local inhomogeneities in the pi state of the manganites ,",
    "the exact structure of the correlated regions is still largely unknown .",
    "moreover , recent studies indicate that the scenario described above , in which nanoscale charge / orbital ordered insulating regions are present in the pi state , is in all likelihood oversimplified .",
    "below , we describe some recent _ x_-ray scattering studies of the structural correlations in the pi state , discuss the implications of these experiments for the local structure of the pi state , and pose questions for future research .",
    "we will focus our discussion on the properties of the nd@xmath9sr@xmath10mno@xmath13 , _ _ x__=0.3 - 0.5 samples .",
    "these properties are representative of the manganites with the fm ground state ; materials with the charge - ordered ground state will be discussed later .",
    "the nanoscale correlations give rise to broad diffraction peaks at the ( 0 , @xmath234 , 0 ) , and ( @xmath235 , 0 , 0 ) reduced scattering vectors , with @xmath235,@xmath234=0.35 - 0.55 in different manganites 88,89,90,91,92,93,94,96 .",
    "( we are using the orthorhombic _ pbnm _ notation , in which @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and @xmath2382@xmath239 , @xmath239 is the cubic perovskite lattice constant . )",
    "a representative overall scattering pattern is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 1 ] .",
    "the broad peaks at ( 4.5 , 4 , 0 ) and ( 4 , 4.5 , 0 ) reflect the presence of the nanoscale correlations .",
    "the intensity of these peaks is believed to reflect the concentration of the correlated regions , and their width is inversely proportional to the region size @xcite .",
    "the position of the peaks defines the period of the lattice modulation in the correlated regions .",
    "the peaks are observed on top of the `` butterfly - like '' shaped background which is attributed to scattering from uncorrelated polarons , also known as huang scattering , and to thermal - diffuse scattering @xcite . to separate this background from the correlated peaks ,",
    "scans along the @xmath240 or @xmath241 directions are taken , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 2 ] .",
    "these scans are fitted to a gaussian or lorentzian line shape and a monotonically sloping background .",
    "the parameters of the correlated peaks in the nd@xmath9sr@xmath10mno@xmath2 samples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 3 ] .",
    "the peak intensity is strongly reduced in the fm state and traces the behavior of the electrical resistivity over the entire temperature range in the pi and fm states .",
    "interestingly , in many samples the structural correlations do not disappear completely below the curie temperature even at the lowest temperatures",
    ". these results are consistent with the earlier pdf measurements @xcite indicating the presence of local jahn - teller distortions in the fm state .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 3 ] show that the correlations survive deep in the fm region of the phase diagram , indicating that the fm state is inhomogeneous .",
    "[ fig5 - 3 ]  also illustrates two other important observations .",
    "first , the correlation length of the nanoscale regions is the same in all samples and is independent on temperature .",
    "the same correlation length is also found in other manganites , including la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 ( _ _ x__=0.2 , 0.3 ) @xcite , and la@xmath242(ca@xmath243sr@xmath244)@xmath245mno@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "second , the period of the lattice modulation is also independent on temperature .",
    "it does depend on the sample composition , but in a very regular manner . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 4 ] we plot the period of the lattice modulation as a function of doping , _",
    "x_. remarkably , all the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 4 ] appear to fall on the same line , which begins at",
    "_ _ x__=0 and @xmath246=2/3 , and ends at _ _ x__=1 and @xmath246=0 .    in its",
    "mostly widely investigated form , the cmr effect is a field - induced transition from the pi to the fm phase . since the nanoscale correlations are suppressed in the fm state , application of a magnetic field should also result in their suppression . the data of fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 5 ] show that this is indeed the case : as the magnetic field is applied , the electrical resistivity is reduced , and the intensity of the correlated peak is diminished , tracing the behavior of the resistivity @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a substantial correlated peak is still present at the highest magnetic field obtainable in this experiment .",
    "the field - induced transition is gradual . assuming that the intensity of the correlated peak reflects the concentration of the correlated regions ,",
    "one concludes that the field - induced state is very inhomogeneous .",
    "finally , we note that the magnetic field affects neither the correlation length , nor the period of the lattice modulation in the ordered regions .",
    "pseudo - cubic perovskite manganites exhibit a number of different structural phases , among them orthorhombic , rhombohedral , and tetragonal .",
    "the nanoscale correlations described above have thus far only been found in the orthorhombic@xmath233 phase .",
    "it remains to be seen whether they exist in other structural phases .",
    "preliminary measurements suggest the possibility that the rhombohedral phase does not support the nanoscale fluctuations @xcite .",
    "an example of the data supporting this claim is shown in fig . [ fig5 - 6 ] which shows temperature dependence of the correlated peak intensity and the electrical resistivity in la@xmath242(ca@xmath243sr@xmath244)@xmath245mno@xmath2 .",
    "this compound exhibits a pi state for _ _",
    "t__300 k. with increasing temperature , the paramagnetic insulating state undergoes a structural transition from the orthorhombic _ o _ state to a rhombohedral state .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ fig5 - 6 ] show that the nanoscale correlations abruptly disappear at the orthorhombic - to - rhombohedral transition . at the same time",
    ", the electrical resistivity is significantly reduced .",
    "these observations are in general agreement with the picture in which the correlations reflect the presence of insulating regions in the sample .    the above experimental results could be summarized as follows : ( i ) the nanoscale structural correlations are present in the orthorhombic pi state .",
    "they are suppressed ( but not completely destroyed ) on the transition to the fm state , independent on whether the transition is induced by changing temperature or magnetic field .",
    "( ii ) the correlation length characteristic to the nanoscale regions is the same in all samples and does not depend on temperature or magnetic field .",
    "( iii ) the period of the lattice modulation is the same linear function of the concentration of the divalent ion ( doping level ) _ x _ in all the samples .",
    "thus , it appears that the structure of the correlated regions in the manganites with the fm low - temperature state is defined by a single parameter , _",
    "x_.    we now turn to the interpretation of these data .",
    "we note that the precise determination of the structure of the correlated regions , similar to that carried out for the layered manganites @xcite , is yet to be done . at this stage , therefore , we can only present some current ideas on this subject . from the very beginning",
    ", the correlated regions were described as small regions possessing charge and orbital order @xcite .",
    "this suggestion was made based on the observed scattering vectors of the maxima of the broad correlated peaks . in the case of _ _",
    "x__=0.3 , these peaks are observed at the same positions as the so - called orbital - ordering peaks in the ce - type charge / orbital ordered state .",
    "thus , it was proposed that small regions with the ce - type order are present in the pi state . as _",
    "x _ deviates from 0.3 , different charge / orbital ordered structures , possibly containing discommensurations , were speculated to be realized @xcite .",
    "in particular , as _ x _ approaches 0.5 , the lattice modulation period approaches 3 , and one of the striped structures observed in highly doped manganites could be realized .",
    "it was also pointed out that if the ordered regions are well defined , their actual size could be significantly larger than the correlation length shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 - 3 ] and [ fig5 - 5 ] , which was defined as inverse half - width at half - maximum of the peaks 96 . thus , the charge and orbital ordered structures described above are compatible with the experimental results .    in the above scenario ,",
    "the charge - ordered structures are observed at doping levels different from those of the corresponding long - range - ordered counterparts .",
    "the ce - type order , for example , is most stable at _ _",
    "x__=0.5 , and the striped structure with a period 3 is observed at _ _",
    "x__=2/3 ( see open symbols in fig . [ fig5 - 4 ] ) . as a possible reason for this discrepancy",
    ", it was proposed that charge - poor and charge - rich regions are formed in the sample @xcite .",
    "the charge concentration in the charge - depleted regions could then be close to the ideal concentration needed for the formation of the charged - ordered structures with the observed periodicity .",
    "several possible reasons for such variations of the charge density were proposed .",
    "first , it can result from chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "it is , however , difficult to see how chemical inhomogeneities would explain the observed common features in a variety of samples with quite different chemical compositions .",
    "second , even in the absence of chemical inhomogeneities , the formation of charge - rich and charge - poor regions is still possible .",
    "a number of theoretical calculations , in fact , predict such a phase separation @xcite .",
    "moreover , electronic phase separation appears to be a generic feature of almost any current theory describing mixed - valence manganites .",
    "note , the usual argument that coulomb interaction would prevent significant spatial charge segregation should not necessarily work in the case of nanoscale domains .",
    "this interaction could , of course , be one of the factors limiting the ordered region size .",
    "it is interesting to note that manganites with the long - range ce - type and striped order exhibit the @xmath22-orthorhombic structure with the lattice constants @xmath247/@xmath28 @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath247-axis contraction in these compounds reflects the jahn - teller distortion of the mn@xmath5o@xmath249 octahedra with the long axis lying in the @xmath250 plane .",
    "thus , on average , the long axes of the mno@xmath251 octahedra lie in the @xmath250 plane in both the long - range charge ordered phase , and in the @xmath22 paramagnetic insulating state .",
    "in contrast , the mno@xmath249 octahedra are undistorted in the rhombohedral ( _ _ r__@xmath29_c _ ) state @xcite .",
    "it appears , therefore , that the average lattice distortion characteristic to the @xmath22 state promotes ( or , possibly , reflects ) formation of the nanoscale correlations .",
    "since there is no _ a priori _ requirement that the local symmetry of the nanoscale ordered regions should match the average symmetry of the crystal lattice , this is quite an interesting observation .",
    "finally , we note that the case of the transition from the pi or fm phase directly to the charge - ordered phase , such as in pr@xmath59ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 or la@xmath123ca@xmath123mno@xmath170 , is more complex . in such transitions ,",
    "the periodicity of the lattice modulation and the correlation length vary on warming as the low - temperature , long - range charge order disappears and the high - temperature correlations arise @xcite .",
    "the existing experimental data are not completely consistent , and it is unclear as to what extent they reflect the intrinsic properties of the pi state .",
    "systematic measurements at temperatures much larger than the charge - ordering transition temperature are needed to answer this question .",
    "summing up , it appears that the important role of nanoscale structural correlations in manganites is currently quite well established . in particular , the presence of these correlations is one of the factors leading to the large magnetoresistance observed in these compounds .",
    "the correlations are found in a number of different manganite compounds , they show a systematic behavior , and , therefore , these correlations are not likely to be the artifacts resulting from unclean samples or secondary phases",
    ".    however , both the experimental investigation of the local structure of the phases exhibiting nanoscale correlations , and the theoretical work on the mechanism of their formation are still in their beginning stage .",
    "while the simple interpretation of the experimental data given above appears to be reasonable , there are several important problems with it .",
    "first , the integrated intensity of the correlated peaks is surprisingly small .",
    "calculations based on the assumption that the magnitude of the lattice distortion in the correlated regions is the same as that in the corresponding long - range ordered phases produce extremely small estimates for the volume fraction of the charge - ordered regions in the pi state .",
    "different authors give estimates for this fraction ranging from several percent @xcite to a small fraction of 1 percent @xcite .",
    "it is hard to see how such a small volume fraction could have a profound effect on the transport properties .",
    "second , the `` uncorrelated polarons '' and the `` nanoscale correlations '' are now often treated as two separate objects . in our opinion , this separation is not altogether justified , and both the _ _ q__=0 and the _ _",
    "q__@xmath120.5 signals might originate from the same object .",
    "further studies of diffuse scattering in these materials , including energy - resolved studies , are clearly needed to address these problems .",
    "the example of manganites clearly shows that local nanoscale inhomogeneities could have a great influence on the bulk properties .",
    "numerous recent studies show that similar inhomogeneities are likely to play an important role in other correlated materials , cuprates and nickelates among them .",
    "understanding the intriguing properties of the correlated materials , therefore , will require understanding details of their local structure .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies addressing this issue will , therefore , play an important role in future work on correlated materials .",
    "in this review chapter , we presented extensive experimental evidence to support the unambiguous existence of phase modulations in mixed - valent manganites .",
    "it is revealed that two important non - trivial inhomogeneities ( or phase modulations ) play an important role in producing colossal magnetoresistance in mixed - valent manganites , i.e. , sub - micrometer - scale ( macroscopic ) and nano - scale ( microscopic ) phase coexistence / fluctuation .",
    "the first ( macroscopic ) phase separation is caused by the coexistence of mainly ferromagnetic metallic and charge - ordered insulating domains at low temperatures with micrometer length scales .",
    "extensive experimental evidence for such a large - length - scale phase modulation was found in the pr@xmath5-substituted la@xmath14ca@xmath15mno@xmath2 system where the relative volume of the electronically- and magnetically - distinct regions varies with pr substitution .",
    "however , it is important to note that both of the main two phases have the same charge densities but quite different long - range strains , resulting from the significantly different crystallographic structures of the metallic and insulating phases .",
    "it is this lattice strain that produces such large - length - scale phase coexistence at low temperature .",
    "this physical situation resembles what generally happens in martensitic systems , in which crystallographically - different phases can coexist at low temperatures to accommodate the significant long - range strain associated with the martensitic transformation . even if many magnetotransport properties of the system can be understood within a percolation model between two different electronic phases , it is still necessary that martensitic - transformation - effects should be included to understand adequately many physical properties of the system .",
    "for example , a martensite - like transformation can naturally bring another charge - disordered insulating phase with lattice strains different from those of the main two phases into play .",
    "thus , extremely sensitive and huge magnetoresistance under an applied magnetic field at low temperature should be also associated with the special situation that structurally different phases can coexist and that they show avalanche - effects when they switch to a new phase under magnetic fields .",
    "the other important phase modulation discussed in this chapter is caused by nano - scale charge / orbital correlated nano - clusters ( or nano - scale charge / orbital ordering ) in the background of the paramagnetic state above the curie temperature ( or charge ordering temperature ) . experimental evidence from transport ,",
    "magnetism , optical spectroscopy , and _",
    "x_-ray scattering studies were presented to show that microscopic phase fluctuation effects can exist over broad doping ranges of the prototypical la@xmath9ca@xmath53mno@xmath2 and nd@xmath9sr@xmath10mno@xmath2 systems above the long - range ordering temperatures . in particular , those results revealed that unusually large fluctuation of the ce - type charge / orbital ordering exists in the samples near the special half - doped manganite la@xmath123ca@xmath123mno@xmath2 .",
    "based on present and previous results , the high temperature ce - type correlations are expected to be dominant over a broad doping ranges of la@xmath47ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 ( 0.3@xmath40__x__@xmath400.7 ) and nd@xmath9sr@xmath53mno@xmath2 ( 0.3@xmath40__x__@xmath400.5 ) . in the future , it will be interesting to identify the exact nature of nano - correlation as a function of carrier concentration at high temperature in many ferromagnetic as well as charge / orbital - ordered manganites .",
    "additionally , we have provided convincing experimental evidence for the existence of _ t _ * , the cluster - forming temperature , in la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 , particularly with _ _ x__@xmath430.5 .",
    "the existence for _ t _ * in low - hole - doping manganites is still not clear yet because transport is always insulating - like up to structural transition temperatures .",
    "future studies are quite necessary directed toward understanding the phase fluctuation effects in the low hole - doping regime of la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 . finally , it is important to note that many systematic studies of various manganites now indicate that the insulating nature above the curie temperature is always associated with the presence of charge / orbital correlated nano - clusters , existing only in orthorhombic crystallographic structures .",
    "thus , the nano - clusters will play a key role in producing cmr near the insulator - metal transition of the manganites .",
    "in other words , sensitive collapse of nano - scale charge / orbital ordering under a small magnetic field will essentially produce a huge drop in resistivity , inducing large negative magnetoresistance just above the curie temperature .",
    "there remain several interesting unsolved questions .",
    "first , most of the competing interactions in manganites seem to produce fluctuations of competing order parameters near its thermodynamic critical or bi - critical points at finite temperatures according to the electronic / magnetic phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 - 1 ] . on the other hand",
    ", it remains to be experimentally clarified whether the giant fluctuations of the half - doped manganites are a direct consequence of the coexistence of competing order parameters even at zero temperature as a theoretical model suggests @xcite . in this context",
    ", the role of quantum fluctuations should be investigated more systematically to determine whether competition of order parameters at zero temperature can play a key role in producing nanoscale - phase coexistence / fluctuation in an unusual phase space in perovskite manganites .",
    "second , the long - range strain - induced phase coexistence might be a generic feature in the manganites with strong jahn - teller effects .",
    "however , local physics based on a jahn - teller electron - phonon coupling alone does nt seem to be enough to describe the observed unique phase modulation with micrometer length scale .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations directed toward understanding the metal - insulator transition induced by long - range strain are important .",
    "third , it is still puzzling why ferromagnetism and metallicity are optimized at the commensurate hole - doping _",
    "_ x__=3/8 , where enhanced electron - phonon coupling can be expected to result in localization of carriers @xcite .",
    "enhanced metallicity exhibited for special commensurate doping might be related to a dynamic nano - scale charge / orbital ordering with stripe correlations .",
    "it is now well known that the high-@xmath252 cuprates have dynamic and short - ranged stripe correlations even in the superconducting regime .",
    "while static charge ordering is clearly compatible with localization of carriers , the exact role of dynamic stripe correlations on the metallicity or superconductivity is still not understood in the cuprates . in this context , the role of dynamic stripe correlations on the carrier mobility should be further investigated in manganites .",
    "finally , the discovery of two important phase - separation phenomena , micro- and macro - scopic , increase our understanding of colossal magnetoresistance found in the perovskite manganites at high and low temperatures , respectively .",
    "phase - modulation phenomena , and related physics established in manganites , however , will be broadly applicable to other strongly correlated material systems , wherein two or multi - competing interactions coexist .",
