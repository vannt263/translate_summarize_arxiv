    "soft matter and life science systems investigated by neutron reflectometry ( nr ) continuously increase in complexity  both in structure as well as in the number and the specific roles of their components .",
    "the same is true for hard matter systems .",
    "this development presents a permanent challenge and demand for continuous improvement of the neutron facilities . on the other hand",
    "there is a constantly increasing request for nr measurements , in particular in soft matter and life sciences , which stems from the unique possibilities of neutrons in probing amphiphilic and self - organizing structures at air - liquid @xcite , liquid - liquid @xcite and solid - liquid ( buried ) interfaces @xcite .",
    "nr in combination with off - specular and grazing - incidence small angle neutron scattering ( gisans @xcite , sesans @xcite , sergis @xcite ) provides deep insight in self - assembly- and aggregation processes @xcite , 1 - 3d ordered interfacial films @xcite and the interplay of length scales in hierarchically structured systems @xcite .",
    "+ current research at the forefront of science with nr covers investigations of protein organization in bio - membranes @xcite , structure , organization and functioning of living cells at interfaces @xcite , nano - engineering @xcite , new materials and interface properties for energy ( storage ) applications @xcite , magnetic fluctuations and domain propagation @xcite as well as magnetic ordering and the understanding of relevant length scales and energies @xcite . + complementary ( on - board ) in - situ techniques in addition to nr are often needed to elucidate complex interfacial structures and processes that are difficult to assess otherwise . in particular x - ray reflectometry @xcite ,",
    "ellipsometry @xcite , brewster angle microscopy @xcite and ir spectroscopy @xcite are essential complementary tools for achieving integrated insight into soft matter and life science systems .",
    "soft matter sample sizes required by nr today are typically of the order of 1000 mm@xmath10 or larger which hinders studies with components that are not available or can not be produced in sufficient quantities .",
    "the latter holds in particular , but not exclusively , for biological systems where typically human proteins provide such bottle - neck .",
    "thus , parametric studies for instance on biological , genetic or pharmaceutical activity are outside the scope of nr measurements today .",
    "such investigations will become available with the high flux of the ess source by utilizing much reduced beam cross sections ( foot prints ) and sample sizes .",
    "+ minimized beam dimensions ( with not necessarily minimized sample size ) will further allow for characterizations of rough and curved interfaces that are common in functional and natural materials like industrial coatings , ball bearings , bone or skin .",
    "in addition , inhomogeneous , patterned surfaces might be scanned for local features with sub - mm beams .",
    "magnetic reference layers in combination with polarized neutron beams offer additional contrast and sensitivity for samples that do not withstand solution contrast changes @xcite . in combination with polarization analysis such experimental set - up",
    "will help discriminating the incoherent background in soft matter and life science systems by spin - filtering @xcite .",
    "+ the ess source @xcite will enable kinetic studies of systems in non - equilibrium situations on time scales not available today . tackling the millisecond range in the future however might still require concurrent sample sizes .",
    "therefore , the reflectometer at ess should foresee flexible and adaptable collimation optics .",
    "the latter is also important whenever interfaces are to be assessed from above and below the sample horizon as can be the case for buried interfaces and interfaces under load , e.g. shear forces in combined nr and rheology set - ups @xcite .",
    "+ the length scale of interest in soft matter and life science systems of the next generation will cover 1 - 3000 @xmath3 , hence an instrument with variable resolution from @xmath11 is required . for the majority of purposes ( not including wide angle and diffraction experiments ) a q - range of 0.005 @xmath12 to 1 @xmath12 will suffice .",
    "the scientific motivation described in the last section combined with additional requirements from ess advisory panels were taken into account when choosing the basic instrument parameters . as a result",
    ", the key strength of this instrument was decided to be the ability to use small samples and to access large momentum transfer values @xmath13 reaching up to @xmath9 1 @xmath6 in both downward and upward direction for liquid samples . in order to match these requirements ,",
    "the following basic parameters were selected :    * moderator : the horizontal reflectometer extracts neutrons from the cold moderator providing the highest flux in the region of interest @xmath14 . * instrument length @xmath15 : the instrument length is determined by the loosest desired resolution of @xmath16 and shortest design wavelength currently being @xmath17 . based on the ess pulse length of @xmath18 ms , @xmath19 is calculated from : @xmath20 which gives @xmath21 m. the current length of the instrument design is 54.9 m and thus very close to the analytical value . *",
    "usable waveband @xmath22 : using the instrument length @xmath23 m , the pulse length @xmath18 ms and the pulse frequency @xmath24 hz , the width of the waveband @xmath22 before main frames start to overlap is : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ms and @xmath27 . thus wavelengths from 2 @xmath28 to 7.1 @xmath28 are used if every neutron pulse is accepted .",
    "the width of the waveband can be increased to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , ... ) @xmath28 , if every second ( third , ... ) pulse is utilized . in principle",
    ", the used waveband can be optimized for each measurement , by shifting it to lower or higher wavelengths ( e.g , 1.5 @xmath28 - 6.6 @xmath28 or 4 @xmath28 to 9.1 @xmath28 ) to improve the intrinsic resolution or q - range , respectively .",
    "* vertical guide shape : a horizontal reflectometer is to provide only a limited vertical divergence on the sample , which depends on the desired @xmath31 resolution .",
    "hence , a constant guide shape can be chosen in the vertical plane , which does not provide large divergence on the sample and is easy to build . at the same time , in order to achieve high @xmath13 values of up to 1 @xmath6 in the case of free liquid surfaces , the beam needs to be bent onto the sample surface by up to @xmath32 9@xmath33 .",
    "such a severe beam deflection is very challenging and requires multiple reflections from tilted or curved mirror surfaces , which is best managed with limited beam heights .",
    "thus the height of the beam @xmath34 is restricted to 2 cm .",
    "the beam deflection part of the guide is described in the next section . *",
    "horizontal guide shape : it is expected that sample sizes for reflectometry will tendencially decrease . to provide a sufficient neutron flux on samples of the order of 1 @xmath2 , the guide system should have focusing properties in the horizontal plane , hence the reflectometer is currently planned with an elliptic guide @xcite , starting with entrance / exit width of 10 cm and a maximum width of 26 cm .",
    "the elliptic guide provides a focused beam to either perform efficient measurements with small samples or restrict the beam size to carry out position dependent studies .",
    "still , the outgoing beam is large enough for also addressing bigger samples , e.g. for time - resolved measurements .",
    "the distance between the source and the guide entrance is 2 m being currently the minimum distance , at which optical components can be placed at the ess .",
    "the first 4 m part of the guide is thus inside the shielding monolith of 6 m radius and is referred to below as the * extraction system * ( guide part 1 ) .    in the following",
    ", the layout of the instrument based on the key parameters listed above is described in more detail ( see also tab .",
    "[ tab : reflectometer ] for an overview ) .",
    "individual beamline components are presented and their characteristics are justified based on results of neutronic mc simulations carried out with the vitess software package @xcite .      the reflectometer is set up for using wavelengths of 2 @xmath3 and longer .",
    "based on the current moderator description provided by the ess and implemented in simulation packages like vitess @xcite and mcstas @xcite , the cold moderator with 12 cm edge length , which provides a larger flux for wavelengths longer than 2.5 @xmath3 , was selected for the reflectometer .",
    "neutron optic elements can be placed in the shielding monolith , which is currently 6 m in radius , beginning at 2 m behind the moderator .",
    "thus beamline components like mirrors or guides can be placed in the monolith to increase the number of neutrons fed into the main guide system outside the first 6 m. while the horizontal shape is elliptic ( see above ) , three options were tested for the vertical shape of the extraction system , that is a constant height of 2 cm , and a tapered guide with the entry height of 8.67 cm and 12 cm , respectively . for the latter ,",
    "the guide entry height matches the size of the moderator .",
    "simulations reveal that the best beam extraction is provided by the tapered feeding guide with 8.67 cm entry height , though it is noted that the performance of the constant guide is only slightly worse .",
    "the conclusion is that a large part of additional phase space accepted by the tapered guide is not transported by the subsequent beamline to the sample position .",
    "a reflectometer aiming for high - q measurements needs to be free of prompt pulse background . taking into account the unprecedented intensity of currently 5 mw and the energy of the primary proton beam of @xmath35 gev",
    "it is unclear whether a t0-chopper is able to remove all of the fast particle and gamma - ray background .",
    "this is why a t0-chopper is not foreseen and the background from the prompt pulse is avoided by the geometry of the guide system .",
    "the latter has to be designed such that in the field of view of the detector , there are no guide elements that lie in the direct flight path from the source .",
    "this is the definition of * avoiding the line of sight twice*. since the horizontal shape of the guide is elliptic and a modification of this shape would interfere with its focusing properties , avoiding the line of sight must be carried out in the vertical plane . +",
    "as a sophisticated chopper system will be placed within the first few meters after the shielding monolith , where also one chopper needs to be moved along the beamline , it was decided to leave the in - monolith section horizontally , i.e. not to have any inclination in the guide system there . on the other hand ,",
    "the guide section 4 , which is upstream from the bending section , should be horizontal , to enable the latter to equally access samples from above and below .",
    "avoiding the line of sight requires a difference in height between the guide position at the monolith and at the bending section .",
    "ways to achieve that are to place a double bender ( * s - bender * ) or a double kink ( * z - kink * ) in between . here ,",
    "a z - kink shows a clearly superior performance , see fig .",
    "[ fig : losbasicsetups ] .",
    "the kink angle is fixed at @xmath36 , which leads to very moderate losses only if compared with a guide system without a kink .",
    "the shift of the maximum in the vertical divergence distribution towards 0.25@xmath33 can be reduced by optimizing the vertical shape of the kink guide element .",
    "the latter shows the best performance if the shape is slightly double - elliptic .",
    "the total length of the kink guide section is 11.2 m and the shift in height of the guide position amounts to @xmath37 cm .",
    "+    in accordance with the demand of avoiding the line of sight twice , the z - kink element should be placed such that fast primary particles are unable to illuminate the guide section after the z - kink , independent of whether their flight path would interfere with the detector area .",
    "a simple raytracing study was performed to determine an optimal position of the latter guide element by scanning the neutron parameter space at the source between @xmath38 cm and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the vertical coordinate of the neutron trajectory at the source and @xmath41 is its vertical divergence .",
    "the study revealed that if the z - kink is placed at a distance of 18.7 m away from the source , all fast particles would propagate at least 6 m outside the guide before entering the last guide section .",
    "since propagation outside the guide can for simplicity be considered as propagation in shielding , it can safely be argued that due to the guide geometry , all fast background will be sufficiently absorbed and the prompt pulse will not contribute to the background at the detector position .",
    "+      as stated above , in order to access a momentum transfer @xmath42 on a free liquid surface the beam must have an incident angle on a horizontal sample of @xmath43 , taking into account the shortest utilized wavelength of 2 @xmath3 .",
    "short wavelength neutrons require several bounces off the beam bending walls in order to be inclined by such large angle @xmath44 , since there is a strong limitation on their maximum reflection angle , e.g. @xmath45 for m=5 supermirror coatings . at the same time",
    ", the reflectometer is to provide sufficient flexibility concerning the variety of incident angles such that also regions of small @xmath46 can be covered .",
    "thus , the beam is tilted down- or upwards on a horizontal sample surface by means of 5 movable deflecting elements , of which the top and the bottom surfaces are covered with m = 5 coating .",
    "the length of each element is @xmath9 1.28 m with the height of 2 cm .",
    "when tilted by @xmath47 each element bends the full beam of 2 cm height by 1.8@xmath33 .",
    "the horizontal shape of the beam bending elements is elliptic , since these elements are still part of the main guide ellipse ( see fig .",
    "the maximum bending angle @xmath43 guaranties for a maximum @xmath42 . bending guide elements can be replaced upon request by a gisans guide module providing horizontal collimation .",
    "the beam characteristics after the bending section are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : beamposatsample ] and [ fig : beamdivatsample ] . in principle",
    ", it is also possible to have shorter ( 1.15 m ) bending elements that can be tilted by 1@xmath33 , hence reaching the maximum reflection angle for a 2 @xmath3 neutron . on the other hand ,",
    "mc simulations show that in this case the intensity at wavelengths around 2 @xmath3 is heavily suppressed .",
    "+    the layout of the bending section is optimized for maximum flexibility and high-@xmath13 while keeping the complexity of the system as low as possible .",
    "the five bending elements can be arranged to bend the neutron beam down- or upwards by a number of possible angles .",
    "their work principle is that neutrons bounce off each element once and propagate towards the sample afterwards , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bendingfig ] .",
    "the drawback is that neutrons with a non - zero divergence have a certain chance of hitting the bottom ( top ) wall of one of the bending elements , if the beam is bent downwards ( upwards ) .",
    "the resulting mis - orientation can be further increased during the propagation of the beam until the neutron is absorbed or leaves the bending section with a high divergence , i.e. does not propagate towards the sample .",
    "this is why the vertical divergence provided by the collimation system does not exceed 0.2@xmath33 fwhm ( 0.3@xmath33 as maximum ) for higher bending angles , even though the maximum divergence can in principle achieve maximum @xmath48 , taking into account the height of the guide of 2 cm and the collimation length of 2 m. it was investigated whether the divergence can be increased by involving more bending elements that would approximate a curved guide .",
    "this , however , would increase the mechanical complexity of the system , while mc simulations showed that there was no significant flux gain at the sample position .",
    "+          the collimation of the neutron beam exiting the bending section of the guide is done by means of two diaphragms ( slits ) located at the guide exit and 2 m downstream from the guide , respectively .",
    "the first slit determines the total vertical divergence on the sample , while the second , so - called footprint slit , is used to reduce the beam size such that it matches the sample dimensions or the requirements for the beam size , e.g. , for position sensitive measurements .",
    "the adjusted divergence depends on the desired vertical angular resolution on the sample . for simplicity one",
    "usually uses matching resolution for divergence and wavelength , thus the opening ( height ) of the first slit depends on the pulse shaping regime used .",
    "the free propagation length of 2 m further allows to install , e.g. , a polarization device between the collimation slits .",
    "+      the reflectometer operates with two chopper setups for basic and high - resolution , respectively .",
    "all choppers are located at the side of the guide to make use of the small beam height and thus reduce the opening / closing time .",
    "the basic setup requires three choppers , which define the main frame and prevent neutrons with other wavelengths from propagating to the detector . in the basic setup ,",
    "the wavelength resolution is defined by the total pulse length @xmath49 ms .",
    "hence the first chopper does not need to be close to the source , as the pulse length will not be reduced .",
    "furthermore , the first few meters after the shielding monolith are occupied by pulse shaping choppers belonging to the high - resolution setup ( see below ) .",
    "thus , the first chopper of the basic setup is placed at 12.5 m , followed by a second chopper at 17.5 m and a third chopper at 31 m. while the first two choppers are designed to suppress background from slow neutrons that otherwise could pollute the subsequent frame(s ) , the third chopper defines the accepted waveband of @xmath50 , if every source pulse is used .",
    "the waveband can be extended , if every second ( third ) pulse is used , see fig . [",
    "fig : basicspectra ] . this can be achieved by reducing the chopper rotation frequency to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , ... ) of the original value . +     to 7.1 ( @xmath29  , ... ) . since only every second ( third ) pulse is used to extract the double ( triple )",
    "waveband , for neutron wavelengths contained in the single waveband the flux is consequently reduced.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    a dedicated wavelength frame multiplication system ( wfm ) was developed for the high - resolution work regime .",
    "its purpose is to provide a high , constant wavelength resolution between @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the utilized waveband , while removing contaminant neutrons .",
    "this layout is very close to the one described in @xcite comprising six choppers in total .",
    "solely the rotation speed of the first three choppers is increased to 112 hz to further reduce intensity losses , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxbasicwfm ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : reflectometer ] .",
    "it is noted that the intensity loss in subframe overlap regions is intrinsic to the way the wfm system is designed , as the subframes are kept separated in time very strictly .",
    "this is necessary for highly structured reflectivity spectra that are recorded with the high - resolution setup . in general , the ansatz described in @xcite , which is very similar to the one used here , could lead to less intensity losses in the subframe overlap regions , but at the expense of a somewhat more challenging subframe separation .",
    "+     for position ) using the basic and high - resolution setup , adjusted for a 1% @xmath0 resolution , for a reflection angle of 1.5@xmath33 .",
    "the intensity drop in the spectrum of the high - resolution system arises from strict prevention of subframe overlap at the detector position.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]      in case of free liquid surfaces or situations where the interface of study needs to be fixed in the horizontal plane , samples are put on a movable sample table equipped with motors for necessary movements in horizontal and in vertical direction .",
    "the positional displacement of the sample from the @xmath55 position of the main guide ( upstream the bending section ) is 84 cm at maximum for the highest possible deflection angle of 9@xmath4 .",
    "this maximum vertical movement is only 1.7 times the vertical displacement of the sample stage realized at figaro at present and thus , will not pose any difficulty in handling on the instrument . the sample table will allow for accessing the sample by the neutron beam from above and below . in the case of air - solid and solid - liquid interfaces samples will be tilted against the fixed incident beam in the horizontal at fixed zero height thus operating the instrument in the more simple @xmath8 mode . in addition",
    ", there should exist enough space for sample environment controlling temperature , pressure , mechanical load etc .",
    "for the very reason the distance between the sample position and the footprint slit is set to 40 cm .",
    "it is envisaged that the reflectometer comprises a position sensitive area detector of 50 x 50 @xmath2 , located 2 m away from the sample position , with a pixel size fine enough to match the angular resolution .",
    "the smallest reflection angles are expected to be 0.3@xmath33 - 0.4@xmath33 .",
    "taking into account the loosest wavelength resolution of 10% the detector resolution should be @xmath56 .",
    "using @xmath57 mm , where @xmath58 is the pixel size and @xmath59 the desired resolution expressed in @xmath60 under the presumption that the divergence distribution is gaussian , it follows that a detector with pixels having 2 mm egde length fulfills the instrument requirements .",
    "furthermore , it will be advantegeous that the detection process takes place in a single conversion layer , since in this case the detector can be tilted by an angle @xmath61 w.r.t the neutron flight path after the sample to improve the angular resolution in vertical direction to @xmath62 .",
    "such setup could even match the high wavelength resolution achieved with the wfm chopper setup .",

    "the radial collimation option offers the possibility to perform gisans measurements at the liquid reflectometer with a resolution matching that of a current state - of - the - art sans instrument .",
    "the layout of the horizontal reflectometer is optimized for measurements with small samples and high q transfers .",
    "its performance is demonstrated by carrying out virtual experiments with different samples of 1x1 @xmath2 area .",
    "fluxes and count rates are given for different angular and resolution settings , which are summarized in tab .",

    "the beam intensity at the sample position is also shown for selected angular settings in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxsample ] .",
    "the simulations were carried out including the ess cold moderator characteristics as of may 2013 .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the basic setup of the reflectometer utilizes three choppers that provide the desired waveband with the wavelength resolution mainly determined by the length of the instrument going up to 10% for 2 @xmath3 neutrons . the slit collimation yields a vertical beam divergence that matches the loosest wavelength resolution ( but",
    "is restricted to max .",
    "@xmath78 fhwm ) .",
    "such a setup is most suitable for measuring reflectivity spectra of free liquid surfaces and monolayers on liquid surfaces , like e.g. langmuir and gibbs adsorption layer of amphiphiles .",
    "the measurement can be performed using the single waveband and three angular settings or the double waveband and two angular settings ( and so on ) . in general , for each angular setting the waveband can be freely selected , e.g. for small angles it is advantageous to use a larger waveband , since the reflectivity is high at low q and thus a larger q - region can be covered with a measurement time still being of the order of a few seconds .",
    "the applicability will depend on the time required by the choppers to change settings from single to double ( triple , ... ) waveband regime .",

    "the parameters of the d - dppe langmuir layer are based on x - ray data @xcite . ] and corresponding count rates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d20measurement ] .",
    "the usage of the double waveband leads to a larger measurement time , but on the other hand the time needed to adjust for an intermediate reflection angle is saved .",
    "the longest measurement time is required , as expected , for highest angular settings . nevertheless , it is possible to measure reflectivities up to @xmath81 within minutes on a 1x1 @xmath2 sample , with at least 100 counts for every data point .",
    "the ability of measuring reflectivities at high q and on samples of 1 @xmath2 size is unprecedented .",
    "for example , the figaro reflectometer at ill is used for measurements up to 0.4 @xmath82 with typically much larger sample sizes . +     for several angle of incidence @xmath83 .",
    "the neutron flux depends both on the diverence range , which is @xmath84 of the incident angle and the footprint size of the 1 @xmath2 sample increasing with @xmath85 .",
    "see also tab .",
    "[ tab : fluxes].,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    it is well known that incoherent background originating from the sample sets a limit on minimum reflectivity that can still be measured with a certain statistical significance . for the ideal d@xmath79o surface of 1x1 @xmath2 area and 0.3 mm thickness , the background is of the order of @xmath86 using the mean free path of @xmath87 cm for d@xmath79o for incoherent scattering .",
    "neutronic simulations with incoherent background included show that even in that case data acquisition times of 100 s suffice in the range up to 0.6 @xmath12 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : inbkgmeasurement ] .",
    "since its shape is flat , the background can be fitted and subtracted from the reflectivity spectrum .",
    "the residual spectrum agrees well with the theoretical curve and all data points still have a high enough statistical significance , with 2@xmath60 being the significance of the lowest data point .",
    "thus , if the measurement can be carried out for a sufficiently long time , being only a few minutes for a 1x1 @xmath2 d@xmath79o sample , reflectivities down to 10@xmath88 can be accessed by background recording and subtraction . in the case of the 1x1 @xmath2 monolayer sample ,",
    "the mean free path of the null reflecting water is @xmath89 and yields a background level of @xmath90 .",
    "for such a sample the total counting time of the order of 4 to 5 hours ( for the largest angular setting ) will suffice to achieve a statistically significant measurement of the monolayer signal after background subtraction . naturally , the required sampling time is inversely proportional to the total sample area and can be significantly reduced if larger samples ( of the order of 10 @xmath2 ) are used .",
