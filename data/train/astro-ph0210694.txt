    "the usno - b catalog , currently released in version 1.0 , is compiled from the digitization of various photographic sky survey plates by the precision measuring machine ( pmm ) located at the u. s. naval observatory flagstaff station ( usnofs ) .",
    "the pmm produces both a pixel archive and a list of detections for each plate in real time .",
    "the plate material includes five complete coverages of the northern sky and four of the southern sky , and contains a mixture of colors and epochs .",
    "the catalog was compiled from the merged lists of detections , and presents position , proper motion , magnitudes in various colors , star - galaxy classification , and various uncertainty estimators for 1,042,618,261 distinct objects .",
    "a discussion of the technical details is presented in the documentation associated with the catalog , and like the catalog is not being submitted for publication in a journal",

    "usno - b is the next step in the sequence of catalogs that started with uj1.0 ( monet et al .",
    "1994 ) , usno - a1.0 ( monet et al . 1996 ) and usno - a2.0 ( monet et al . 1998 ) . in simple terms , usno - a was a 2-color , 1-epoch catalog while usno - b is a 3-color , 2-epoch catalog .",
    "this statement , like most generalities about these catalogs , is incorrect .",
    "the southern surveys that were part of usno - a were taken at 2 epochs , and there is no first epoch blue survey south of @xmath1 to include in usno - b . for both catalogs ,",
    "an object must be detected on two different surveys to be included in the catalog since isolated , single survey detections are unreliable . for usno -",
    "a , this meant that the object must have detectable red and blue fluxes , and this led to the exclusion of many faint objects with non - neutral colors .",
    "also , the epoch difference in the southern surveys meant that objects with larger proper motions tended to be excluded .",
    "usno - b attempts to fix both of these problems .",
    "an object detected on the same color survey at two epochs will be included in usno - b as will objects which have significant proper motions , although it is still the case that objects with large motions and extreme colors may be omitted .",
    "the selection algorithm requires that spatially coincident detections must be made on any two of the surveys for an object to be classified as real and be included in the catalog .",

    "pmm differs from most other astronomical plate scanners because it uses a 2-dimensional charge coupled device ( ccd ) camera as its sensor .",
    "a schmidt plate is digitized in 588 separate exposures , and each produces a 1312 by 1032 image digitized with 8-bit resolution .",
    "the ccds have 6.8 by 6.8 micron pixels , a 100% fill factor , and are read at 10 million pixels per second .",
    "a complete exposure cycle takes about 0.5 seconds including the shutter operation and integration times .",
    "a lens provides 2:1 imaging of the ccd on the focal plane . using a nominal plate scale of 67 arcseconds per millimeter , the pixels are about 0.9 arcseconds in size , the field of view is about 20 by 15 arcminutes , and spacing between exposures is about 18 by 13 arcminutes .",
    "pmm has two ccd camera systems , but mechanical limitations restrict parallel operations to about 60% of each plate .",
    "pmm is also different from other scanners because all image processing is done in real time .",
    "each ccd is connected to a computer by an optical fiber and a dma interface , and each frame is fully archived and processed before the next is taken .",
    "the processing is quite complicated , a detailed description ( including source code ) is included in the usno - b documentation , but the following gives the major steps .",
    "after the data arrive in physical memory , the process forks and one path writes the raw data to magnetic tape and then exits .",
    "the processing path starts with bias removal , flat field correction , and an object finder .",
    "each object is processed in steps of increasing precision , but the processing of each object is independent of all others .",
    "this independence enables the usage of parallel processing by the four cpus in each computer , and was a necessary simplification given the computers available in the early 1990s .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] lists all of the parameters computed for each object in every frame .",
    "this rich parameter set obviates the need to make a `` star '' or `` galaxy '' decision in real time .",
    "once the entire plate has been scanned , the list of object parameters is flushed first to disk , and then ( offline ) to cd - rom .",
    "all data in the usno - b catalog come from these files , and the lookback index given for each detection in the catalog allows all quantities to be recovered from the database .",
    "perhaps the only portion of the algorithm worthy of comment here is the one used to compute the image position .",
    "the image data are 8-bits in transmission , and by measuring photographic negatives , the sky is bright and the images are faint . since most of the survey plates are lacking density calibration spots or wedges , and",
    "because the scattered light in the images is small ( perhaps 0.5% ) but significant , the choice was made to omit a density - to - intensity calibration , and to deal with the images in transmitted light .",
    "all of these effects increase the already noisy nature of the photographic emulsion , and tests showed that a least squares estimator was necessary . in the faint limit ,",
    "stars look something like a gaussian , but they have flat cores and wide wings when saturated .",
    "the choice was made to use the function @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the six free parameters are @xmath4 ( central amplitude ) , @xmath5 ( background ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( position ) , @xmath8 ( saturation radius ) , and @xmath9 ( extent of image wings ) . extensive testing indicated that this symmetric version provided a more stable estimate of the image position than the somewhat better fitting function that includes a seventh free parameter for asymmetry .",
    "traditional non - linear least squares based on marquardt s algorithm ( bevington 1969 ) was used .",
    "iteration was terminated after three steps , regardless of convergence : testing showed that good images were fit immediately , and that bad images never found a good fit .",
    "the plate scanning sequence was developed during the testing phase of the pmm program .",
    "the first step was to do test exposures and adjust the neutral density filters in the illumination beam to compensate for the background diffuse density of the plate .",
    "this was needed because some plates were almost clear while others were almost black .",
    "next , the spatial scanning pattern was done without using the imaging cameras , but while using laser micrometers to measure the distance from the camera to the emulsion .",
    "this was needed because plates sagged in the platens , the platens sagged , and because some plates had significant ripples in the glass .",
    "once a 2-dimensional map of the plate surface was measured , a low - order polynomial was fit to produce the map that was used during the scanning to keep the ccd a constant distance from the plate .",
    "the third step was to focus the cameras by maximizing the sky granularity in the image .",
    "the combination of the nominal focus , the map of the plate surface , and the compensation for the background density allowed the scan to commence .",
    "each vision system had an independent prescan sequence , but the scanning of the plates used both cameras whenever possible .",
    "each platen holds four plates , and typical , out of the galactic plane plates took about an hour to scan and produced about 200,000 detections .",
    "the slowest plates were in the region of baade s window , took about seven hours to scan , and produced more than 7,000,000 detections .",
    "pmm has two platens , and barcodes were placed on all platens , plate envelopes , and magnetic tapes to minimize bookkeeping errors .",
    "the hardware and software were frozen at the start of production - mode scanning ( 1994.7 ) , and it took about @xmath10 seconds ( 1994.7 to 2001.2 ) to process essentially all of the almost 19,000 plates involved . about @xmath11 pixels were processed ( 100,000 pixels per second ) and about @xmath12 detections were logged ( 75 detections per second ) .",
    "pmm now sits idle .",
    "the first step of the calibration takes the pixel coordinates computed in each of the 588 exposures needed to scan a plate , combines them with the metrology of the pmm platen , and produces a catalog of positions in pmm focal plane coordinates ( integer @xmath13 meters ) .",
    "it turned out that the elaborate pre - scan efforts to determine proper focus were not accurate enough , so a numerical refocusing algorithm was developed .",
    "this adjusted the coordinates computed in each exposure so as to maximize the number of overlapping frame multiple detections and to minimize the dispersion in their mean positions .",
    "the revision to the focus computed by this algorithm was typically smaller than the focal depth of the camera , but occasionally a plate was found wherein the real time focus was significantly in error .",
    "the second step was to compute a catalog of astrometric standards for each plate .",
    "to the extent enabled by the slalib software package ( wallace 1994 ) , the coordinates of stars in this catalog are the apparent position of the star on an idealized schmidt plate given the circumstances of the observation .",
    "the catalog of pmm measures was correlated with these standards , and a cubic transformation was computed .",
    "as is well known , the combination of the schmidt telescope and the photographic emulsion suffers from large astrometric errors as a function of magnitude .",
    "one of the problems with the astrometry presented in usno - a is that it used the faintest tycho-2 stars ( hg et al .",
    "2000 ) as its astrometric calibrators . while this was the best that could be done at the time ,",
    "all of these stars are in deep saturation on the survey plates .",
    "hence , the astrometry of faint , unsaturated stars suffered from field - dependent effects that were suspected but uncharacterized at the time usno - a was compiled .",
    "a different strategy was employed for usno - b . as part of the pmm program ,",
    "the northern proper motion plates ( klemola et al . 1987 ) and the southern proper motion plates ( platais et al . 1998 ) were scanned , and an astrometric catalog called ys4.0 was compiled ( monet _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude of ys4.0 is about @xmath14 , and these stars are not saturated on the schmidt survey plates .",
    "the advantage of this strategy is that the astrometric calibration avoids saturated stars .",
    "the disadvantage is that the mean epoch of ys4.0 is about 1975 , and the mean motion between ys4.0 and the schmidt surveys was set to zero by the least squares solution .",
    "hence , the proper motions in usno - b are relative , not absolute , and future releases of usno - b will attempt to remove this bias through the introduction of a statistical model .",
    "the first iteration of the astrometric algorithm assumed only a cubic relationship between the plate coordinates and the astrometric standards .",
    "once all of the plates were processed , the astrometric residuals were co - added as a function of position in the focal plane , and the systematic , fixed pattern of astrometric residuals was computed .",
    "this was done independently for each survey , and solutions were done as a function of magnitude and declination .",
    "( declination is a surrogate for zenith distance since most plates were taken near the meridian . )",
    "no obvious correlations with declination were seen , but very large terms and differences in terms were found as a function of magnitude . all of these maps are included in the documentation associated with the digital version of usno - b , but figure 1 shows typical maps ( poss - i 103a - o survey at internal pmm magnitudes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . for usno - b ,",
    "separate maps were used for each survey at each integer internal magnitude between 10 and 19 .",
    "the map for @xmath15 was used at all internal magnitudes brighter than 10 , and that for @xmath17 was used for all magnitudes fainter than 19 .    given the maps of fixed pattern astrometric error , the astrometric solution pipeline was rerun , the maps were included , and the cubic mapping between plate and catalog coordinates was recomputed .",
    "finally , all measures were transformed from plate coordinates to sky coordinates to produce plate - by - plate catalogs of j2000 coordinates at the epoch that the plate was taken .",
    "although a more thorough analysis of the astrometric accuracy of the usno - b catalog is planned , a coarse estimate can be obtained from the dispersion of the fits for the individual observations ( items q and r in table  [ tbl-3 ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the subset of objects with all possible detections ( i.e. , 4 in the south and 5 in the north ; about 40% of all objects in usno - b ) shows that the median dispersion is about 0.12 arcsec in both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is an approximate value , and it ignores possible systematic components arising from position on the plate , brightness of the image , or other effects .",
    "users should remember that some usno - b objects with large astrometric uncertainty may be erroneous combinations of observations of different objects , that the uncertainty in the predicted position of an object increases with time since the mean epoch ( often in the 1970s ) , and that usage of this estimated accuracy should not replace a computation for each object using the values listed in the catalog and the desired epoch of observation .",
    "the photometric calibration of the usno - b catalog is of marginal quality , and will be revised as the appropriate data become available .",
    "the root of the problem is that an all - sky catalog of faint photometric standards does not exist .",
    "because of this , a 2-step photometric calibration strategy was adopted .",
    "the first step was to calibrate the bright stars on all the plates .",
    "tycho-2 stars are almost all brighter than @xmath20 , and although the images are grossly saturated , an almost linear relationship exists between the internal magnitudes measured by the pmm and values computed from spectral energy distributions and the @xmath21 magnitudes listed in the catalog .",
    "details of the modeling are presented in the documentation accompanying the digital version of the usno - b catalog , and henden s file _",
    "tables.txt _ contains the results . since",
    "tycho-2 stars are measured on all plates , the bright star fit was extrapolated and applied to all pmm measures from that plate .",
    "the remaining task was to compute the systematic differences between the true calibration for faint stars and the extrapolation of the bright star fit .",
    "two sources of photometry for faint stars ( magnitudes from 14 to 22 ) were used , the guide star photometric catalog 2 ( bucciarelli et al .",
    "2001 ) and the photometric data measured for the usnofs ccd parallax program ( monet et al .",
    "henden s tables were used to convert between the standard system magnitudes and the photographic magnitudes , and the combination of these two catalogs provided faint standards on 3,281 plates , or about 44% of the total needed .",
    "polynomial fits ( linear or cubic as necessary ) were computed , and the calibrated magnitudes for all objects were obtained .    for the remaining 56% of the plates without faint photometric calibrators ,",
    "the calibration was computed from the plate overlap zones .",
    "the plates adjacent to an uncalibrated plate were searched , and if any had a faint calibration , then it was identified as a possible calibrator , and the distance between plate centers was tallied .",
    "after searching all nearby plates , the closest one was found and if there were more than 500 objects in common , a calibration was computed .",
    "there were 3,517 ( about 47% ) uncalibrated plates that were adjacent to calibrated plates , but three more steps were needed to complete the calibration of all plates .",
    "no analysis of all possible overlap regions was done , and this is an area wherein improvements are anticipated in future releases of usno - b .",
    "it is difficult to give a single number for the photometric accuracy of usno - b , but the solution combining all 632,827 calibration stars spread over 3,281 plates has a standard deviation of 0.25 magnitudes .",
    "this value includes whatever effects might arise from the transformation of @xmath22 to @xmath23 colors , but a similar value is found for each of the ten different surveys taken separately .",
    "many plates , particularly those calibrated with the photometry from the usnofs parallax program , show substantially smaller errors , and solutions for plates without photometric calibrators may be worse .",
    "another major problem with usno - b photometry is that a separate calibration for the photometry of extended objects was not done . in part , this is due to the relatively few catalogs of galaxy photometry .",
    "another factor is that the transformation from magnitudes in a standard system to those in the photographic bandpasses is even less well determined than for stars .",
    "the final reason was that the photometric response of the plates is quite non - linear , and no attempt was made to compute the transformation between the observed values of transmitted light and the true intensity incident on the plate .",
    "whereas the photometry of stars may be useful , the usno - b magnitudes for non - stellar objects are qualitative , at best .",
    "although commonly called star / galaxy separation , the value presented in usno - b is a measure of the similarity of the unknown object to a stellar point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "most objects that are dissimilar to the psf are galaxies , but many other types of astronomical objects and photographic artifacts can produce objects in the catalog . since the measured transmission was not converted to a true intensity , and because the photographic process is inherently non - linear , the stellar psf varies with apparent brightness and position in the focal plane .",
    "the method used to distinguish stars from nonstellar objects was an oblique decision tree with three nodes .",
    "each node of the decision tree is a plane defined by values of two image description parameters , and six ( not necessarily distinct ) image parameters are needed to define this tree .",
    "a decision tree must be trained on a set of objects of known type ( star or galaxy ) .",
    "the training set in the northern sky was chosen to be the plates containing the coma cluster of galaxies .",
    "the training set was compiled by hand by examining kpno 4-m ccd frames of the coma cluster taken in good seeing by secker ( 1997 ) .",
    "the catalog of coma cluster galaxies by godwin , metcalfe , & peach ( 1983 ) was also consulted .",
    "because of the non - linearities in the image in transmitted light , each interval of one internal magnitude was searched for the set of six image description parameters that provided best star / nonstar discrimination out of the entire set ( see table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "once the training plate of each northern survey was calibrated , the edges of the stellar ridge lines of the various image parameters were identified in five annular zones centered on the plate center . for each of the other plates in the survey , the stellar ridge lines of the relevant parameters were mapped ( shift and stretch only ) to those of the training plate zone by zone , and the classification index was computed for each object .",
    "the calibration of the southern sky was done in a similar manner , but the training set was taken to be a particularly good plate in the equatorial overlap zone , and truth was taken to be the classification from the northern plates .",
    "the largest source of classification error is the inability to match the stellar ridge line on a given plate to that on the training plate .",
    "the classifier produces an integer in the range @xmath24 that measures the similarity of the unknown object to a stellar psf .",
    "values of @xmath25 are probably non - stellar , and values of @xmath26 are probably stellar .",
    "the catalog gives the individual classifications from all surveys other than those taken on _ iv - n _ emulsions ( see table  [ tbl-3 ] bytes 2039 ) .",
    "various internal tests suggest that the classifier is correct about 85% of the time for objects with internal magnitudes 1420 , but a thorough discussion of the classifier , estimates for its accuracy , and a suggested algorithm for combining the individual estimators for a single object will be given by canzian et al .",

    "as was found with usno - a , these files increase the efficiency of catalog access .",
    "users who need a more detailed description are urged to read the documentation and the source code distributed with the catalog .",
    "the overriding concerns were to include as many objects as is reasonable ( since the alternative is to omit the associated detections ) , and to require spatially correlated detections on any two or more surveys ( even if the combinations may seem curious ) . at usnofs",

    "the sdss results are based on ccd data , and have substantially smaller uncertainties than the observations from which usno - b was compiled .",
    "the astrometric comparison for objects determined by sdss to be unblended and in the magnitude range of @xmath31 shows a dispersion of about 0.13 arcseconds for stars and 0.20 arcseconds for galaxies . unfortunately , systematic offsets as large as 0.25 arcseconds were found , and these are taken as evidence for distortions of the usno - b1.0 astrometric calibration .",

    "@xmath32    these relations are determined from the 34 poss - i fields and the 40 poss - ii fields that are covered by the sdss edr , so represent only a small fraction of the usno - b catalog .",
    "examination of the residuals from these relations suggests that there are additional systematic errors that depend on magnitude , up to 0.15 mag , and that vary from plate to plate , up to 0.2 mag for red plates and somewhat worse for blue plates . little systematic variation ( @xmath330.1 mag )",
    "is seen with distance from the center of a plate .",

    "usno - b is essentially 100% complete for stars determined to be unblended with other objects by sdss , but the completeness drops to about 97% when all sdss objects are considered .",
    "this is yet more evidence that ccd data are far superior for image deconvolution than those obtained from photographic plates .",
    "usno - b is roughly 92% complete for unblended sdss galaxies with @xmath35 .",
    "table  [ tbl-4 ] shows the correlation between usno - b and sdss classifications as a function of sdss @xmath34 magnitude .",

    "it is an all - sky catalog of positions , proper motions , magnitudes , and classifications for more than a billion objects , and its accuracy is about 0.2 arcseconds for astrometry , 0.3 magnitudes for photometry , and 85% for object classification .",
    "as demonstrated by the comparison to the sdss edr and other zone catalogs , systematic astrometric and photometric errors exist in this version , and there may be large regions of sky wherein the automated verification algorithms failed without signaling an error .",
    "the release of usno - b1.0 is a compromise between the desire for public access and the process of catalog compilation and verification .",
    "the next step in the usno - b process will be the database join with the 2-micron all sky survey ( skrutskie et al .",
    "http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass_ ) , and this will entail a top - to - bottom verification and recalibration of the usno - b algorithms . the scheduled release date for usno - b1.1 is september 2003 .",
    "as was usno - a , usno - b is just a milestone in the processing of the pmm s archive .",
    "future work will be directed toward finding a way to calibrate the data from all of the plates that pmm has scanned , and to identify a method to make these available to the community .",
    "manpower and costs are finite , but the quality and importance of the historic photographic data justify these efforts .",
    "the first , and probably the most important acknowledgment goes to the many individuals ( observers , technicians , assistants , graduate students , etc . ) , mostly anonymous except in biodegrading paper logs and documents , whose dedication and expertise have produced the stunning collection of plates that pmm had the privilege of scanning .",
    "the record of the sky is irreplaceable , and that it is of such high quality serves as an inspiration to those who follow in their footsteps .",
    "most of the errors and inaccuracies in usno - b belong to pmm , and not to the original archive .",
    "although technically in the public domain and hence requiring no acknowledgment , it is appropriate to repeat these sentences from minkowski and abell ( 1963 ) .",
    "`` the sky survey was made financially possible by grants from the national geographic society .",
    "the society provided the photographic materials and special equipment required , the salaries of the personnel employed full or part time on the survey , and the production of the two sets of contact positives on glass of each survey photograph .",
    "the observing time with the 48-inch schmidt telescope required to obtain the sky survey photographs was made available by the palomar observatory of the california institute of technology . ''",
    "this work is based partly on photographic plates obtained at the palomar observatory 48-inch oschin telescope for the second palomar observatory sky survey which was funded by the eastman kodak company , the national geographic society , the samuel oschin foundation , the alfred sloan foundation , the national science foundation grants ast84 - 08225 , ast87 - 19465 ,",
    "ast90 - 23115 and ast93 - 18984 , and the national aeronautics and space administration grants ngl 05002140 and nagw 1710 .",
    "some of the measures used in the usno - b catalog are based on photographic data obtained using the uk schmidt telescope .",
    "the uk schmidt telescope was operated by the royal observatory edinburgh , with funding from the uk science and engineering research council , until june 1988 , and thereafter by the anglo - australian observatory .",
