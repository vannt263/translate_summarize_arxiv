    "the skutterudites constitute an interesting class of materials for applications as thermoelectric energy converters,@xcite since they possess the necessary electronic properties , notably a large seebeck coefficient , and a low thermal conductivity .",

    "x is a pnictogen , e.g. p , as and sb , and r is the filler atom , typically a rare earth element , such as la or ce .",
    "the skutterudites offer a rich ability for engineering in order to optimize their properties by alloying on the metal or pnictogen lattices , as well as by careful selection of the filler element .",

    "the ability to lower the thermal conductivity in cosb@xmath0 by using filler atoms is limited@xcite since the filling factor , y , is rather small and focus on filled skutterudites has been directed towards other skutterudites , such as fe containing r@xmath4fe@xmath7co@xmath8sb@xmath6 since the filling factor is larger for such systems and for r@xmath4fe@xmath5sb@xmath6 the filling factor reaches unity.@xcite filled r@xmath4fe@xmath5sb@xmath6 systems have been studied for quite some time .",
    "however , the binary fesb@xmath0 system has not received much attention even though an understanding of the dynamics of the filler and its impact on the electronic structure and thermal conductivity can not be complete without an understanding of the properties of the host framework . according to the phase diagram@xcite fesb@xmath0",
    "is metastable in comparison to fesb@xmath2 , which also possess interesting thermoelectric properties , and sb .",
    "recently , however , micrometer thick films of fesb@xmath0 has been synthesized by nanoalloying of fe and sb precursors at @xmath9  k@xcite and its physical properties investigated experimentally.@xcite a significant difference compared to cosb@xmath0 is that fesb@xmath0 is softer and a softening of low - energy phonon modes would likely have a favorable influence towards a lower thermal conductivity of fesb@xmath0 compared to cosb@xmath0 .    since there are no theoretical studies focusing on fesb@xmath0 we investigate the electronic structure , lattice dynamics and possible dynamic stability of fesb@xmath0 using methods based on density functional theory .",

    "[ fig : bands ] , it is clear that the phonon modes can be divided into two regions in terms of energy : the lower region which contains both acoustic and optical modes , which in the case of fesb@xmath0 lies in the energy range of 0  to  20  mev , and the upper optical region , which for fesb@xmath0 lies in between 27  to  33  mev . in cosb@xmath0",

    "in addition , we find that the upper optical region in lafe@xmath5sb@xmath6 is split in two regions with a gap at 27  mev , which is dramatically different from the behavior in the binary systems where this region contains modes with dispersions that cross and overlap each other . for cosb@xmath0 there is a narrow gap at about 13  mev which splits the lower phonon energy region . among the systems studied here ,",

    "we find that the pdos of fe has two small broad peaks at @xmath257  mev and @xmath2515  mev , as well as a larger feature between 27 and 33  mev which has two clear peaks , see panel ( b ) in fig .",

    "these observations are in good agreement with available experimental pdos measured by mchel et al.@xcite compared to cosb@xmath0 , also plotted in fig  [ fig : phonondos ] , the pdos of fesb@xmath0 show the same behavior as the phonon dispersions that the lower phonon energy region is narrower in fesb@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , in cosb@xmath0 the sb projected pdos shows distinct features , such as two deep valleys at @xmath2513  mev and @xmath2520  mev as well as a very distinct peak at @xmath2522  mev .",

    "the two binary skutterudite systems therefore show distinct differences in their lattice dynamics and especially so for the dynamics of the sb atoms in the two systems .    when la is inserted into fesb@xmath0 , we find that the total pdos from 0 up to about 7.5  mev are very similar , however , when projected onto sb there is a marked difference between the filled and unfilled systems .",

    "we find that in order to obtain a dynamically stable system it is required to evaluate the lattice dynamics for the ferromagnetic ground state of fesb@xmath0 .",
    "phonon calculations for the non spin - polarized phase yield unstable phonon modes along most high symmetry directions .",
    "we note that the calculations of the lattice dynamics have been done within the harmonic approximation at @xmath20  k. however , the harmonic approximation is known to fail for systems that are stabilized at finite temperatures , since anharmonic effects are not included in the calculation .",
    "famous examples are the high temperature phases of zr,@xcite ti@xcite and hf@xcite which all have the bcc structure at elevated temperatures even though the bcc structure for these systems is dynamically unstable in the harmonic approximation . the low t@xmath45 for fesb@xmath0 combined with the fact that the phase is made experimentally at @xmath46  k@xcite suggest that the non spin - polarized phase will be stabilized at finite temperature in a similar fashion as the examples mentioned above .",
    "compared to cosb@xmath0 we find that the lattice dynamics in fesb@xmath0 differs in several respects , for example : the sb pdos in fesb@xmath0 is more flat and narrower compared to cosb@xmath0 which shows more features in the pdos , especially a significant peak about 22  mev that is not present in fesb@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the pdos of fe at large phonon energies show a clear two peak feature which is not the case in cosb@xmath0 which is more flat .",
    "we also find that fesb@xmath0 is softer than cosb@xmath0 based on the form of the phonon energy dispersions and pdos as well as from calculations of the elastic constants of the two systems .    when compared to filled lafe@xmath5sb@xmath6 , we find a hardening at low phonon energies for the filled system of the sb pdos which coincides with the la pdos peak centered at 7  mev .",
    "this hardening of the sb pdos is in perfect agreement with the experimental result of mchel et al.@xcite    furthermore , we find that fesb@xmath0 is mechanically stable , i.e. have @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath3 greater than zero , as well as dynamically stable in its bulk form .",
    "this suggests that it should be in principle possible for a process route to be established in order to produce bulk samples of binary fesb@xmath0 .",

    "<S> we have performed density functional calculations of the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of the binary skutterudite fesb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ground state of fesb@xmath0 is a near semi - metallic ferromagnet with @xmath1  k. furthermore , we find that fesb@xmath0 is softer than cosb@xmath0 based on an analysis of the relation of the elastic constants and the shape of the phonon density of states in the two systems , which is in agreement with experimental observation . based on these observations </S>",
    "<S> we find it plausible that fesb@xmath0 will have a lower thermal conductivity than cosb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , our calculations indicate that fesb@xmath0 may be stable towards decomposition into fesb@xmath2 and sb . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for ferromagnetic fesb@xmath0 we obtain real - valued phonon frequencies and also a @xmath3 greater than zero , indicating that the system is mechanically as well as dynamically stable . </S>"
