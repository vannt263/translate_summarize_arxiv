    "light scattering is a widely used technique to measure the properties of particles in colloidal dispersion systems .",
    "one of the main applications of the dynamic light scattering ( dls ) technique is to measure the sizes of spherical particles in liquid suspension .",
    "the standard method of cumulants@xcite has been used to measure the hydrodynamic radius , or more strictly apparent hydrodynamic radius @xmath5 @xcite of particles from the normalized time auto - correlation function of the scattered light intensity @xmath0 with the assistance of the einstein - stokes relation , where @xmath6 is the delay time . in order to obtain the effective diffusion coefficient@xcite or the apparent hydrodynamic radius@xcite to detect small poly - dispersities for large particles ,",
    "dls technique is endeavored to use at different scattering angles .    in the previous work@xcite ,",
    "the particle size information included in the static and dynamic light scattering data and the influences of particle size distribution on the deviation between an exponentiality and @xmath0 at a scattering angle of 30@xmath7 have been explored .",
    "the particle size distributions obtained using different techniques have been compared . in this work ,",
    "the effects of the scattering angle on the nonexponentiality of @xmath8 are investigated using dilute poly(@xmath1-isopropylacrylamide ) microgel and standard polystyrene latex samples in dispersion respectively .",
    "the results show that the effects of the scattering angle on the deviation between an exponentiality and @xmath0 are small .",
    "since the method of cumulants measures the particle size distribution from the nonexponentiality of @xmath0 at a single scattering angle , the simulated data were thus used to explore the effects of the particle size distribution on the difference between them at different scattering angles .",
    "the analysis reveals that the deviation between an exponentiality and @xmath0 is determined by the particle size distribution and scattering angle . in general ,",
    "the influences of the particle size distribution are small on the nonexponentiality of @xmath0 and very large on the initial slope of the logarithm of @xmath8 and the effects of the scattering angle are determined by the particle size distribution and mean particle size . under some conditions ,",
    "the deviations between an exponentiality and @xmath8 are greatly influenced by the scattering angle .",
    "the values of the apparent hydrodynamic radius are also determined by the particle size distribution and scattering angle . the apparent hydrodynamic radius and its distribution obtained using the cumulants method are different from the hydrodynamic radius and its distribution .",
    "when the rayleigh - gans - debye ( rgd ) approximation is valid , the normalized time auto - correlation function of the electric field of the scattered light @xmath9 for dilute poly - disperse homogeneous spherical particles in dispersion is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the static radius , @xmath12 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath13 is the scattering vector , @xmath14  is the wavelength of the incident light in vacuo , @xmath15 is the solvent refractive index , @xmath16 is the scattering angle , @xmath17 is the number distribution of particle sizes and the form factor @xmath18 is    @xmath19    from the einstein - stokes relation    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the viscosity of the solvent , boltzmann s constant and absolute temperature respectively , the hydrodynamic radius @xmath24 can be obtained .",
    "traditionally the cumulants is a standard method to measure the particle size distribution from the dls data @xmath25 . in this work ,",
    "the following equation was used to analyze the dls data to the second moment    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the average decay rate , @xmath28 is the effective diffusion coefficient , @xmath29 is the second moment and @xmath30 is a constant that depends on the experimental geometry for a given experimental measurement .",
    "the apparent hydrodynamic radius @xmath5 can be obtained from @xmath31    @xmath32    the relative width of the apparent hydrodynamic radius distribution is@xcite @xmath33    if the first cumulant is used , the value of the apparent hydrodynamic radius @xmath5 at given scattering angle and delay time @xmath34 can be calculated directly using the static particle size information and the relationship between the static and hydrodynamic radii .",
    "if the dls data during the delay time range @xmath35 and @xmath36 are chosen to obtain @xmath5 at a given scattering angle , the average value of apparent hydrodynamic radius can be calculated using the following equation    @xmath37",
    "the sls and dls data were measured using the instrument built by alv - laser vertriebsgesellschaft m.b.h ( langen , germany ) .",
    "it utilizes an alv-5000 multiple tau digital correlator and a jds uniphase 1145p he - ne laser to provide a 23 mw vertically polarized laser at wavelength of 632.8 nm .    in this work ,",
    "two kinds of samples were used .",
    "one is pnipam submicron spheres and the other is standard polystyrene latex spheres .",
    "the samples used in this work have been detailed before@xcite .",
    "the four pnipam microgel samples pnipam-0 , pnipam-1 , pnipam-2 and pnipam-5 were named according to the molar ratios @xmath38 of cross - linker @xmath39-methylenebisacrylamide over @xmath1-isopropylacrylamide .",
    "the sulfate polystyrene latex with a normalized mean radius of 33.5 nm and surfactant - free sulfate polystyrene latex of 55 nm were named latex-1 and latex-2 respectively .",
    "in this section , the nonexponentiality of @xmath3 is investigated using the standard polystyrene latex and pnipam samples at different scattering angles .      for small particles ,",
    "the standard dls technique can be used at any given scattering angle . for narrow particle size distributions ,",
    "the effects of the form factor can be neglected , the particle size information obtained at different scattering angles should be the same .",
    "the particle sizes and distributions of the standard polystyrene latex samples latex-1 and latex-2 provided by the supplier are small and narrow respectively .",
    "the deviation between an exponentiality and @xmath0 are investigated at a temperature of 298.5 k and scattering angles 30@xmath40 , 40@xmath41 , 50@xmath41 , 60@xmath41 , 70@xmath41 , 80@xmath42 , 90@xmath41 , 100@xmath41 , 120@xmath41 , 130@xmath7 , 140@xmath41 and 150@xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the logarithm of the dls data @xmath43 was plotted as a function of the delay time @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the results for latex-1 and latex-2 measured at scattering angles 30@xmath41 , 60@xmath41 , 90@xmath41 , 120@xmath41 and 150@xmath41 are shown in figs .",

    "the values of apparent hydrodynamic radius obtained at different scattering angles almost are equal . for latex-1 and latex-2 ,",
    "the values are about 37.27 nm and 64.5 nm respectively .    for pnipam samples at high temperatures ,",
    "the particle sizes and distributions obtained using the sls technique are small and narrow .",
    "the nonexponentiality of @xmath0 for pnipam samples at hight temperatures are investigated as the standard polystyrene latex samples latex-1 and latex-2 at a temperature of 298.5 k. the results for pnipam-1 and pnipam-2 at about a temperature of 312.6 k and scattering angles 30@xmath41 , 60@xmath41 , 90@xmath41 , 120@xmath41 and 150@xmath41 are shown in figs .",

    "figure 2 shows clearly the nonexponentiality of @xmath3 at a given scattering angle investigated is small .",
    "the values of apparent hydrodynamic radius obtained at different scattering angles almost are equal . for pnipam-1 and paipam-2 ,",
    "the values are about 137.8 nm and 136.5 nm respectively .      for large particles",
    ", since most of scattering light is cancelled due to the light interference in the vicinity of the scattered intensity minimum and the scattered intensity at large scattering angles is influenced by the reflected light , the information included in dls data is complex . in order to avoid the considerations for the situations , the nonexponentiality of @xmath2 is investigated at small scattering angles before the emergence of the scattered intensity minimum .",
    "for the samples pnipam-1 and",
    "panipam-2 at a temperature of 302.2 k , the scattered intensity minimums emerge at about the scattering angles 85@xmath7 and 97@xmath41 respectively , the deviations between an exponentiality and @xmath0 are explored before the scattering angle 75@xmath41 .",
    "the logarithm of the dls data @xmath44 was plotted as a function of the delay time @xmath6 .",

    "figure 3 shows clearly the nonexponentiality of @xmath0 at a given scattering angle investigated is small .",
    "the values of apparent hydrodynamic radius are a function of the scattering angle . for pnipam-1 the values are about 320 nm to 310 nm and for pnipam-2 the values are from 300 nm to 295 nm during scattering angle range from 30@xmath41 to 70@xmath7 .",
    "because the distributions of the pnipam submicron and standard polystyrene latex samples are narrow and the expected values of the dls data calculated based on the commercial and static particle size information are consistent with the experimental data@xcite , the dls simulated data were used in order to explore the effects of particle size distribution on the deviation between an exponentiality and @xmath3 and the initial slope of the logarithm of @xmath45 at different scattering angles in detail .",
