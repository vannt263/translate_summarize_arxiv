    "the notion of asymptotic dimension of a metric space was introduced by gromov in @xcite .",
    "it is a large scale analog of topological dimension and it is invariant by quasi - isometries .",
    "this notion has proved relevant in the context of novikov s higher signature conjecture .",
    "yu @xcite has shown that groups of finite asymptotic dimension satisfy novikov s conjecture .",
    "dranishnikov ( @xcite ) has investigated further asymptotic dimension generalizing several theorems from topological to asymptotic dimension .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the relationship between asymptotic dimension of a gromov - hyperbolic space ( see @xcite ) and the topological dimension of its boundary .",

    "he observes that the same argument shows that @xmath5 for @xmath6 a hyperbolic group and asks whether such considerations lead further to the inequality @xmath7 .",
    "bonk and schramm ( @xcite ) have shown that if @xmath0 is a gromov - hyperbolic space of bounded growth then @xmath0 embeds quasi - isometrically to the hyperbolic @xmath8-space @xmath9@xmath10 for some @xmath8 .",
    "it follows that @xmath11 ( see also @xcite for a proof of this ) . if @xmath12 is any metric space one can define ( @xcite , @xcite ) a hyperbolic space @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a visual hyperbolic space then @xmath0 is quasi - isometric to @xmath15 ( i.e. the boundary determines the space ) .",
    "so it is natural to ask whether @xmath16 for visual hyperbolic spaces in general . besides the argument sketched in @xcite , sec .",
    "@xmath3 makes sense in this context too .    in this paper",
    "we give an example of a visual hyperbolic space @xmath0 such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "so the inequality @xmath19 does nt hold for this space .",
