    "we may reverse the trajectories on one side of the circle used for cross correlations and obtain @xmath292 instead of just @xmath285 .",
    "there are also additional base diagrams at the second order correction to trees , which may be treated as in @xcite , but which we do not treat here since there are now diagrams at the the first order correction .",

    "so we select the @xmath305 such sets from our multiplication .",
    "since each outgoing channel ( although appearing twice ) is distinct we may relabel them appropriately to reduce our leading order diagrams to @xmath34 ways of permuting a single outgoing label .",
