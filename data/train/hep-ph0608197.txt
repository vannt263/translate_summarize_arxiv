    "@xcite and the phase transitions between those configurations were investigated by kugler and shtrikman  @xcite .",
    "recently , the idea of using crystallized skyrmions to study nuclear matter was revived by park , min , rho and vento with the introduction of the atiyah - manton multi - soliton ansatz in a unit cell  @xcite .",
    "the soliton model incorporating quark degrees of freedom into each soliton was also considered in 80 s .",
    "achtzehnter , scheid and wilets investigated the friedberg - lee soliton bag model with a simple cubic lattice  @xcite . due to the periodicity of the background potential , the solution of the dirac equation has the form of the bloch waves , @xmath2 where @xmath3 satisfies the same periodic boundary condition as the background potential .",

    ". then the lowest energy level ( `` bottom '' of the band ) for the valence quarks becomes s - state .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions at the cell boundary should be imposed on the quark wave functions as well as the chiral fields .",
    "this simple treatment sheds light on the nucleon structure in nuclear medium .",
    "soliton matter within this approximation have been extensively studied by using various nucleon models such as the the chiral quark - meson type model  @xcite , friedberg - lee soliton bag model  @xcite , the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "the non - zero dispersion of the lowest band @xcite and the quark - meson coupling @xcite were also examined within this approximation .",
    "the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) can be interpreted as the soliton bag model including not only valence quarks but also the vacuum sea quark polarization effects explicitly  @xcite .",
    "the model provides correct observables of a nucleon such as mass , electromagnetic value , spin carried by quarks , parton distributions and octet , decuplet @xmath4 baryon spectra  @xcite .",
    "amore and de pace studied nuclear matter in the cqsm using the wigner - seitz approximation and observed the nuclear saturation  @xcite .",
    "they examined the soliton solutions with three different boundary conditions imposed on the quark wave function .",
    "however the obtained saturation density was lower than the experimental value .",
    "they thus concluded that such discrepancy is originated in the approximate treatment  @xcite of the sea quark contribution .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we studied the nuclear matter in cqsm and observed splitting of the nucleon-@xmath5 spectra .",
    "the vacuum polarization was treated exactly and a relatively shallow saturation was obtained .",
    "however for the value of the constituent quark mass @xmath6 reproducing the octet and decuplet baryon spectra , the soliton breaks even at low densities .    in this paper , we construct the matter soliton solutions including @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "the role of @xmath8 is to produce the short range effects of the nuclear force and stabilize the solution at high densities .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
