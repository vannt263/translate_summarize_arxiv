    "in the last decade surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers)@xcite has made rapid progress towards applications . with a sensitivity rivaling fluorescence in some cases , and a much higher structural specificity , sers is a highly attractive technique , being developed simultaneously with the field of plasmonics .",
    "progress towards different uses of sers in practical applications has been steady .",
    "new substrates including : arrays of inverted pyramids@xcite , silver pillar and torroid arrays@xcite , adaptive silver films@xcite , and metallic nano - shells@xcite , have been demonstrated .",
    "in addition , many molecules relevant to a myriad of applications such as glucose@xcite , proteins@xcite , dna@xcite , a wide range of medicinal drugs@xcite , and substances for forensic science@xcite , have been characterized . on the other hand ,",
    "the understanding of some fundamental aspects of the phenomenon is still incomplete , and in some cases controversial .",
    "although a full understanding is sometimes not essential for the development of applications , there can be no denying the fact that better comprehension is desirable .",
    "optical pumping of vibrational modes was first suggested in 1996 based on the observed dependence of the anti - stokes / stokes ( as / s ) ratio with incident laser power@xcite , and it was suggested that this could be a possible tool to estimate sers cross sections . however , the interpretation of the experimental results have been the subject of considerable debate in the literature , with many authors simply denying its existence and attributing the experimental observations to either laser - heating , resonance effects , or combinations thereof@xcite . over a series of previous papers",
    "we have suggested the investigation of the as / s - ratio as a function of temperature @xmath0 as an alternative method for the observation of pumping@xcite . in a recent paper , we provided definitive evidence for the existence of vibrational pumping under sers conditions thereby bringing to conclusion one aspect of this complex problem@xcite .",
    "here we address another aspect , namely the problems associated with estimating the sers cross section using this method , and we extend our analysis to include different analytes and laser excitations .",
    "we also highlight several outstanding issues which were not considered previously@xcite .",
    "obtaining good estimates of sers cross sections is in general an extremely hard problem and has been a longstanding ambition of the sers community for reasons that go from the purely applied ( quantification of signals ) to the more fundamental ( comparisons of theoretical electromagnetic enhancement factors with experiment ) .",
    "any method that can produce a standard protocol for the estimation of sers cross sections is , accordingly , of great interest and an effort to understand its principles and limitations is required .",
    "before we go into the details , we briefly review the necessary concepts for understanding as / s - ratios and vibrational pumping in sers .",
    "the method we are going to present has not been widely used and therefore we review the historical background and also its peculiarities and limitations .",
    "the discussion has some natural overlap with our previous papers@xcite but it is presented here for the sake of completeness , the convenience of the reader , and future reference for forthcoming work in progress .",
    "this will inevitably result in a somewhat lengthy introductory section where the principles of the method are laid down .",
    "the next sections are fully devoted to this and are followed by a section at the end with a practical experimental demonstration of sers cross section determination for several standard probes .",
    "let us consider the different contributions to the population of a single vibrational level at temperature @xmath1 during a sers measurement ; we can identify two main contributions : @xmath2 the laser itself which pumps vibrations through raman processes with a rate proportional to its intensity @xmath3 and to the raman - stokes cross section @xmath4 , and @xmath5 thermal excitation and relaxation .",
    "vibrations remain in the level with a finite lifetime @xmath6 , which encompasses all possible relaxation mechanisms such as intramolecular vibrational relaxation ivr ( anharmonic processes ) or external relaxation mechanisms .",
    "there are other possible secondary mechanisms , such as relaxation through an anti - stokes raman processes , or excitation to higher vibrational levels .",
    "it is possible to write rate equations for the detailed dynamics of vibration populations in such a system @xcite . in the regime of weak pumping ( which is the only case considered here ) , where the vibrational population remains small , @xmath7 , it is sufficient to consider only the two main mechanisms , and the rate equation for @xmath8",
    "can then be written as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the raman - stokes cross section , @xmath11 the intensity ( power per surface area ) of the laser , @xmath12 the energy of an exciting photon ( @xmath13 is the number of incident photon per unit time and surface area ) , and @xmath14 the energy of the vibration .",
    "the first term on the right is the number of vibrations per unit time being pumped into the level by the action of the laser , while the second and third terms are the contributions of thermal excitation and population relaxation , respectively . in the steady state @xmath15 .",
    "generally , @xmath10 is very small , so when @xmath11 is small the pumping contribution is negligible and the vibrational population is dominated by thermal effects ; i.e. @xmath16 is given by a boltzmann factor .",
    "when @xmath11 is increased ( so that there is a significant pumping contribution to the population of the level ) @xmath8 becomes : @xmath17 where the pumping term is clearly distinguished from the thermal contribution .",
    "in addition , for an ensemble of @xmath18 molecules , the stokes - raman signal is given by @xmath19 while the anti - stokes signal is given by @xmath20 , leading to : @xmath21 moreover , taking the ratio of the anti - stokes to the stokes intensities @xmath22 , we have : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the _ asymmetry factor _ ( extensively discussed in refs .",
    "@xmath24 includes not only any possible difference between anti - stokes and stokes cross sections arising from resonance effects ( due either to plasmon resonances or to resonant raman scattering for a resonant analyte ) , but also the standard wavelength dependence of raman processes @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 can be expressed as : @xmath27 .",
    "\\label{pumpratio}\\ ] ]    this simple model shows that the stokes - raman signal always remains linearly dependent on @xmath11 .",
    "the anti - stokes signal also shows a linear dependence with power when pumping is negligible .",
    "but when pumping dominates over thermal effects , then @xmath28 varies quadratically with power while the as / s - ratio is linearly dependent on @xmath11 .",
    "the original work by kneipp et .",
    "al.@xcite used rhodamine 6 g ( rh6 g ) and crystal violet ( cv ) ( two commonly used sers active dyes ) under @xmath29 excitation at room temperature ( rt ) . the argument for pumping",
    "was primarily based on two observations : ( i ) the as / s - ratios were shown to be larger than expected for a boltzmann factor , and ( ii ) the _ power dependence _ of the signal at rt ( where the thermal contribution is likely to dominate , or be important ) was quadratic .",
    "this observation of a non - linear dependence of the anti - stokes intensities with power ( resulting in a linear dependence in the as / s - ratio ) was thought to provide strong evidence for vibrational pumping in sers .",
    "further measurements on carbon nanotubes@xcite and a dna - base@xcite supported these initial results .",
    "the arguments against this original interpretation are summarized in the following subsection .",
    "haslett et .",
    "al.@xcite were the first to seriously question the existence of vibrational pumping as revealed in the original studies .",
    "extensive measurements were made under similar conditions with a number of both resonant and non - resonant molecules .",
    "they observed an anomalous ratio for all the resonant molecules tested which was independent of power until photo - bleaching occurred .",
    "no anomaly was observed in the case of the non - resonant molecules .",
    "it was concluded that the anomalous ratios observed in the original papers were the result of `` hidden '' resonances rather than pumping@xcite .",
    "al.@xcite also concluded that the observed anomalous ratio could be explained by resonances .",
    "these resonances are accounted for by the asymmetry factor @xmath24 in the model of the previous section . in the absence of pumping ,",
    "the as / s - ratio is predicted to be : @xmath30 it is clear that the @xmath24 factor can indeed result in anomalous ratios ( different from the boltzmann factor ) , even in the absence of pumping .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that the observed power dependence was not the effect of pumping but rather laser heating .",
    "the effect of heating on @xmath26 in the absence of pumping can be simply understood by including it in eq .",
    "( [ ratio - corrected ] ) .",
    "the real temperature of the probed molecule , @xmath31 , may be different to the nominal temperature @xmath1 because of heating effects , either in the sers substrate or in the molecule itself @xcite . by writing @xmath32 and assuming that @xmath33 we can obtain the corresponding ratio , @xmath34 , by expanding eq .",
    "[ ratio - corrected ] as : @xmath35 this expression first shows that heating can also result in an anomalous as / s ratio , even when @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , it can have an important impact on the power dependence of @xmath26 , because @xmath37 should increase with @xmath11 .",
    "we can assume in a first approximation that @xmath38 , since heat diffusion and transfer are linear problems .",
    "the above expression shows that laser heating should then result in an exponential increase of @xmath34 with @xmath11 .",
    "however , in many cases of interest , the argument in the second exponential is small compared to 1 , and eq .",
    "( [ ratio - x ] ) can then be further expanded to give : @xmath39 a linear dependence of @xmath26 with @xmath11 ( or equivalently a quadratic dependence of @xmath28 with @xmath11 ) _ can then equally be the result of conventional heating effects or pumping_. such an observation is therefore insufficient to demonstrate the presence or not of vibrational pumping .",
    "we also note that heating effects can also explain the mode - dependent behavior observed in the original work @xcite , as the argument of the second exponential in eq .",
    "( [ ratio - x ] ) depends on the mode energy @xmath14 .",
    "most studies have concentrated on finding evidence for sers pumping at room temperature ( rt ) , in particular by studying the power dependence of the as / s ratio .",
    "it is true that the huge enhancements in sers conditions greatly increases the contribution from pumping , but may also contribute to an increased heating ( in particular directly in the probe molecules ) . at room temperature ( rt ) and above , the thermal contribution to @xmath26 is relatively large and in many cases dominates , such that @xmath40 .",
    "the study of vibrational pumping at rt therefore involves measuring small departures from an already existing ( large ) thermal population .",
    "moreover , as the previous discussion has shown it is also extremely difficult to distinguish the relative contributions of pumping and heating at rt .",
    "a more practical approach is to study the temperature dependence of the as / s ratios , and in particular the low - temperature regime where thermal effects are expected to be completely negligible compared to any other mechanisms , and in particular pumping .",
    "the temperature dependence can be directly studied using the model presented so far .",
    "figure [ schmratios ] summarizes the different scenarios for as / s - ratios as a function of temperature .",
    "the solid lines show the variation of the ratio with @xmath1 when pumping is absent ; i.e. an exponential decrease as @xmath1 decreases , following the boltzmann factor @xmath41 .",
    "the dashed lines show the case when pumping is present . at high @xmath1 s",
    "the ratio is approximately the same as if pumping were absent .",
    "this is the _ thermally - dominated regime_. as @xmath1 is decreased , there is a cross - over to a _ pumping - dominated regime _ , where the ratio reaches a plateau .",
    "we refer to the cross - over temperature between these two regimes as t@xmath42 ; indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "[ schmratios ] .",
    "the cross - over occurs when pumping and thermal terms in eq .",
    "( [ pumpratio ] ) are comparable , which occurs for : @xmath43^{-1}\\ ] ] the cross - over occurs at a larger temperature for higher powers @xmath11 , for which pumping is stronger , but also for higher energy peaks ( with a larger @xmath14 ) , for which thermal excitation is weaker .    in the pumping - dominated regime ,",
    "the as / s - ratio is constant and equal to @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 can be estimated to a high degree of accuracy for a given experimental setup .",
    "if @xmath46 ( no asymmetry between @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) we can therefore deduce the product @xmath49 from the plateau in the as / s - ratio below @xmath50 .",
    "in general , and in particular under sers conditions , @xmath51 , but its value can be determined from the exponential dependence in the thermally - dominated regime ( above @xmath50 ) . in practice , a fit of the experimental data over the whole temperature range with two parameters enables us to determine both @xmath24 and @xmath52 @xcite . nevertheless , the problem of estimating @xmath6 still needs to be circumvented to determine the sers cross - section @xmath10 itself .    by reducing @xmath1 , the contribution from pumping becomes dominant , making measurements much easier , and more reliable .",
    "it also simplifies greatly their interpretation .",
    "but the main advantage is that it enables one to unambiguously rule out heating effects as an alternative explanation . as discussed , the appearance of plateaus for @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ schmratios ] is a clear characterization of the pumping - dominated regime .",
    "note that it does not mean that heating is absent , but simply that its effect on as / s - ratios is negligible ( relative to the pumping contribution ) .",
    "any heating effects may possibly affect the value of @xmath50 , but as long as a plateau is observed , vibrational pumping must occur .",
    "moreover , the value of @xmath26 in the plateau region ( from which we will infer sers cross - sections ) is independent of heating .",
    "studies of the temperature dependence of @xmath26 therefore provide a more conclusive demonstration of sers pumping .",
    "however , the technique is not without its drawbacks . in order to extract sers cross - sections for the method discussed here",
    "there are several issues that need special attention as described below .",
    "several issues need to be considered in the practical determination of sers cross sections via vibrational pumping .",
    "not all of them can be resolved satisfactorily and we have to include some _ ad - hoc _ approximations in order to obtain estimates of the cross sections .",
    "while there is nothing intrinsically wrong with this , it is necessary to be aware of the range of validity of the estimates in order to be able to comprehend the current limitations of the method as proposed .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that in most situations in raman ( and in sers ) we talk plainly about the cross section @xmath54 while in reality there are at least three possible cross sections we can refer to : @xmath2 radiative , @xmath5 non - radiative , and @xmath55 total . in the case of vibrational pumping , for example",
    ", the rate at which vibrations are pumped into the molecule is proportional to the _ total _ cross section . but some of the re - emitted photons might not be observable in the far - field because they are absorbed by plasmon resonances in the vicinity of the probe .",
    "this is what makes the distinction between _ radiative _ and _ non - radiative _ cross sections .",
    "this could lead potentially to inconsistencies among cross sections for different modes if they happen at frequencies where the non - radiative contributions are different .",
    "we will not insist on this distinction in the following , but it is worth keeping in mind that as far as the cross sections is concerned what we measure is the `` radiative '' part of an effect ( pumping ) which depends on the `` total '' ( radiative plus non - radiative ) cross section .",
    "this distinction could under certain circumstances be important .",
    "we summarize in this subsection the different aspects of the problem of lifetime estimation for the purpose of obtaining sers cross sections .    * ultimately , the observation of a cross - over from a thermally - dominated to a pumping - dominated as / s - ratio leads to an estimation of both the asymmetry factor @xmath24 and the product @xmath56 .",
    "an estimation of @xmath47 itself requires the knowledge of @xmath6 , as pointed out before .",
    "the latter can not be directly obtained , in general , from the sers spectrum potentially leading to a serious limitation of this technique . in the first report of cross section estimation via vibrational pumping@xcite a lifetime of @xmath57",
    "was simply estimated without any reference to the experimental data .    in order to improve upon this",
    "we need to make a series of assumptions .",
    "the validity of these assumptions needs to be evaluated on a case - by - case basis and the results obtained for the cross section have to be interpreted within these approximations / assumptions .",
    "let us first review the problems associated with trying to extract lifetimes from the sers spectra .",
    "* raman peaks in molecules have lineshapes which are seldom pure lorentzians and have several contributions to their natural widths ; a subject of a longstanding history in spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "the observed linewidth has typically contributions from : @xmath2 groups of raman modes piled up together in narrow energy regions ; @xmath5 inhomogeneous broadening , @xmath55 phase coherence relaxation , and @xmath58 population relaxation .",
    "the last two are also known as the _ off - diagonal _ ( dephasing ) and _ diagonal _ ( population ) relaxation times in density matrix formalism@xcite , respectively , and are part of the _ homogeneous broadening _ of the peak .",
    "these relaxation times are different from mode to mode and can not be easily separated from the observed linewidth in a plain sers spectrum .",
    "the _ population relaxation _ is the one we need ( @xmath6 ) for the estimation of @xmath10 . *",
    "the presence of multiple modes contributing to a peak is a drawback that can be overcome in many situations . in the case of dyes",
    "it is not unusual for several raman active modes , which are closely spaced in energy and have different cross - sections , to contribute to the observed peaks .",
    "this will naturally result in distortions of the lineshape and problems with any estimate of the lifetime based on the width of the peak .",
    "this can be overcome by the use of well characterized vibrations which are relatively isolated from the others and even ( if possible ) complementing the information by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the raman spectra@xcite to support the selection of those modes that are the best candidates for a reliable estimation of @xmath6 . *",
    "if the broadening is homogeneous@xcite , the only remaining contributions to the linewidth are the diagonal and off - diagonal relaxation times .",
    "molecular vibrations have typically very strong anharmonic couplings with other vibrations in the molecule and contributions to inhomogeneous broadenings are mostly negligible . even in sers experiments where the single molecule limit is approached@xcite ( which would be more sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening ) the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , @xmath59 , of the peaks does not change by more than @xmath60 @xmath61 in peaks with a typical @xmath59 of @xmath62 @xmath61 . the validity of this assumption ( whether inhomogeneous broadening is important or not ) has to be assessed obviously in each specific situation . *",
    "the separation between diagonal and off - diagonal relaxation times can not be achieved by a simple sers spectrum .",
    "it is always possible to invoke a different type of spectroscopy ( time resolved)@xcite , but this may not be feasible in most situations .",
    "one simple possibility ( as done in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is to estimate the population relaxation by using the fwhm @xmath63 of the peaks via @xmath64 ; i.e. essentially ignoring the contribution of the dephasing ( off - diagonal ) relaxation to the width .",
    "this will produce an underestimation of @xmath6 and an overestimation of @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , this typically produces cross - sections for different peaks which are not entirely consistent with the relative ( integrated ) intensities among peaks ; thus showing an intrinsic inconsistency in the estimation of the @xmath6 s ( which can be of the order of a factor of 2 to 10 for the examples we examined ) .",
    "it is generally difficult to make a simple estimation that will be valid for all modes .",
    "it is quite clear that for the cross sections to be meaningful ( and if they are not affected by different amounts of non - radiative processes ) the relative cross sections among peaks must be in accordance with the relative integrated intensities observed in a normal sers spectrum .",
    "* population relaxation is caused mainly by the anharmonic coupling to the `` thermal bath '' .",
    "this bath includes all other modes in the molecule as well as those in the solvent or substrate . generally speaking",
    ", higher energy modes have shorter lifetimes due to a greater number of possible decay pathways .",
    "intramolecular anharmonic decays are energy conserving , meaning that high energy modes have more possibilities for a decay than low energy ones .",
    "population relaxation is also the only dynamical process that contributes to the vibrational linewidth in the limit @xmath65 . *",
    "it is important to realize that , in principle , _ if we find a single peak in the spectrum where the population relaxation can be gained directly from the fwhm via _",
    "@xmath64 , _ then all of the cross sections of the other modes follow immediately through the relative integrated intensities of the peaks_. when lacking a time resolved experiment to isolate the contributions properly , _ the problem comes down to a judicious choice of a mode where the width is dominated by relaxation population_. a compromise then is to extract the values of the cross sections by means of the width of the highest ( isolated ) raman active mode .",
    "a rule of thumb is that the lower the temperature and the higher the energy of the mode the more the linewidth will be dominated by population relaxation .",
    "we can then use one mode to estimate its @xmath47 , and all the others follow automatically from this assumption .",
    "the cross sections are now consistent by construction and the method provides , in fact , the means to estimate the relative lifetimes of the modes .",
    "we call this procedure ( i.e. estimating the @xmath6 of the raman active mode with the largest raman shift , and making the other cross - sections consistent with this value through the relative integrated intensities ) the _ corrected lifetime method _",
    "( clm ) . *",
    "if we are comparing different substrates with the same analyte we could also directly compare the values of @xmath52 without any further assumption . if there is no reason to believe that relaxation population is different between the two substrates , _ the ratio of @xmath52 for two different substrates provides a direct comparison of sers cross sections_.      * problems with measuring the asymmetry factor `` @xmath24 '' can be as important as those to obtain a reliable lifetime .",
    "heating in the thermally - dominated regime can be a _",
    "major _ problem . as demonstrated in sec .",
    "ii b , heating can be in part a source for a larger than normal @xmath24 , if it is not properly identified .",
    "* ideally , the best estimation of @xmath24 can come from measurements at rt with long integration times and very low powers .",
    "the obtained @xmath24 s should be more or less the same for a given analyte in the presence of the same metal ( they are mainly related to the local interaction of the dye with the metal@xcite ) . *",
    "the product @xmath66 is measured with high accuracy in the pumping dominated `` plateau '' at low temperatures .",
    "accordingly , the best use of the technique is to use one well - characterized analyte ( without photo - bleaching if possible ) as a means to compare the relative sers cross - sections of the dye on different substrates of the same metal , by simple comparison of the plateaus .",
    "the product @xmath66 is perhaps the best `` objective '' comparison between the cross sections of two substrates without any assumption .",
    "however , it is also important to note that the cross sections we are comparing are not the average cross sections but rather a biased average towards the highest cross sections in the sample , as explained in the next subsection .",
    "there are additional complications with the estimation of the cross section .",
    "it is generally accepted that sers signals are dominated by the presence of `` hot - spots '' or places with high local enhancements .",
    "the formulae presented above made implicitly the assumption that the cross section is the same for all @xmath18 molecules in the sample .",
    "the question we want to address now is : do we obtain an estimate of the average cross section with this method ?",
    "we shall show in what follows that what we actually obtain from the experiment is an estimate which is heavily biased towards the sites with the highest enhancements ; i.e. the method provides an estimate of the enhancements in hot - spots .",
    "this is of course an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time .",
    "we show this explicitly in this section .",
    "we consider a number of molecules ( @xmath67 from 1 to @xmath18 ) in the sample .",
    "each molecule can have a different anti - stokes , ( @xmath68 ) and stokes ( @xmath69 ) sers cross sections ( according to the asymmetry factor @xmath70 for that molecule ) .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the incident power @xmath11 is the same for all .",
    "the rate equation for the average phonon population @xmath71 of a vibrational mode of _ one molecule _ , @xmath67 , and its stationary state solution are given by expressions similar to eqs .",
    "( [ rateeqn ] ) and ( [ nsteady ] ) : following the other formulae in the previous sections , the stokes signal for this molecule is simply @xmath72 , while the anti - stokes signal is given by : @xmath73 .",
    "the anti - stokes / stokes ratio _ for this molecule _ , @xmath74 , is given by an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ pumpratio ] ) .",
    "if all the molecules experienced the same enhancements , then the total stokes and anti - stokes intensities would be @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and the ratio would be @xmath77 .",
    "however , if the molecules have different cross sections ( sers enhancements ) , which is a much more realistic assumption , we then have : @xmath78 and @xmath79 all the averages here @xmath80 are the usual statistical ensemble averages .",
    "the as / s - ratio is then : @xmath81.\\ ] ]    comparing this expression with that obtained previously in eq .",
    "( [ pumpratio ] ) , what we called @xmath24 is now replaced by : @xmath82 note that this is not exactly the average of the @xmath83 s , i.e. @xmath84 . moreover , what we measure ( instead of @xmath85 ) is now : @xmath86    to understand the meaning of @xmath87 ( @xmath88 for ensemble ) , we need to understand the sources of non - uniformity .",
    "the main variation is in the cross - sections , because of the large differences in sers enhancements at different locations on the sers substrate .",
    "we typically have values which are , say , @xmath89 larger at hot - spots than in other places .",
    "however , for a given molecule , the ratio @xmath90 should not vary as much ( at least not by more than one order of magnitude ) . in fact , this ratio can in a first approximation be taken as a constant , which is an intrinsic property of the adsorbed molecule / metal complex@xcite . assuming that @xmath91 is the same for all molecules",
    ", we simply get that @xmath92 , i.e. the @xmath24 we measure is the correct one . moreover , using @xmath93 , we can express @xmath87 as a function of @xmath94 only as :    @xmath95    if the distribution of @xmath10 s were fairly uniform ( for example a gaussian around an average value with a small standard deviation ) then @xmath87 would be a good estimate of the average of the distribution ( slightly overestimated ) .",
    "but this is far from reality in sers conditions .",
    "a more realistic situation is to have a small number of molecules at a hot - spot ( hs ) , and a large number of molecules at non - hs positions . for",
    "the sake of argument , let us demonstrate the effect on this average by considering @xmath96 molecules with one molecule at a hs and 999 molecules at places with much lower enhancements .",
    "the expression given above would give : @xmath97 if there is a difference of a few orders of magnitude between the cross sections @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the numerator is then easily dominated by the one molecule at the hs ( due to the square ) . for the numerator ,",
    "it is not as clear - cut , it all depends on how much stronger the hs is and how many molecules are at non - hs positions . but overall , the denominator is likely to be dominated by @xmath98 , possibly slightly larger if the second contribution is not negligible .",
    "this shows that @xmath100 , or perhaps slightly smaller .",
    "a more quantitative argument is only possible if we had a more realistic distribution of sers enhancements for a given substrate , but the qualitative conclusion is that _ pumping experiments provide a good lower estimate of the cross - section of the few molecules experiencing the highest enhancements_.      the last aspect we want to briefly touch upon in this analysis of cross section estimations via vibrational pumping is photo - bleaching",
    ". the exact mechanisms of photo - bleaching under sers conditions are still poorly understood and would deserve a full study in itself .",
    "photo - bleaching is particularly important in the method we are describing here because molecules sited at hs s (",
    "i.e. those exposed to the largest enhancements ) are affected to a greater degree . at high power densities ,",
    "for example , the population of molecules at hs s will be bleached at a faster rate than the average and this will change the measured cross section . studying @xmath26 under photo - bleaching conditions could , in principle , tell us something about this distribution .",
    "there is robust experimental evidence that photo - bleaching can complicate the analysis , produce experimental artifacts , and -to a large extent- even decide the answer we obtain from a specific experiment .",
    "this is added to several experimental complications in as / s - ratios which include the fact that sometimes ( depending on the dispersion of the spectrometer ) the anti - stokes and stokes sides can not be measured simultaneously .",
    "this implies a delay between the two measurements and therefore a difference in exposure times to the laser . by choosing a certain power level we are , in a way , selecting the population of hs",
    "s that we are going to measure .",
    "we shall come back to this problem in the discussion of the results .",
    "a rule of thumb is that larger laser spots with low power densities ( but sufficient to produce detectable pumping ) , short integration times , and non - resonant ( with the dye ) laser excitation , are in general preferable for a more reliable estimate of sers cross sections .",
    "all possible measures should be taken ( including the type of scanning used ) to address and minimize the undesirable effects of photo - bleaching .",
    "we turn now to an experimental demonstration of the principles underlined above .",
    "sers measurements have been performed on substrates formed by dried ag colloids on silicon .",
    "the colloids were prepared using the standard lee and meisel technique@xcite .",
    "sers active samples were prepared by mixing the colloids with a @xmath101 kcl solution in equal amounts .",
    "the analytes were then added to give a concentration of @xmath102 in each case . a small amount of this solution",
    "was then dried on to a silicon substrate .",
    "the investigated analytes are rhodamine 6 g ( rh6 g ) , crystal violet ( cv ) , and 3,3-diethyloxadicarbocyanine ( dodc ) .",
    "figure [ analytes ] shows the basic sers spectra of the analytes .",
    "we shall show the explicit temperature dependencies of the as / s - ratios for only a few modes ( labeled in fig .",
    "[ analytes ] ) while the tables show additional data for other modes .",
    "samples were mounted in a closed - cycle he - cryostat ( cti - cryogenics ) with temperature control in the range @xmath103 .",
    "raman measurements were performed using several laser lines of a kr@xmath104 and ar@xmath104-ion lasers which were focused to a 20 @xmath105 m diameter spot .",
    "the signal was collected using a high - numerical aperture photographic zoom lens ( canon , @xmath10610 magnification ) onto the entrance slit of a high - dispersion double - additive u1000 jobin - yvon spectrometer coupled to a liquid n@xmath107-cooled ccd detector .",
    "peaks were analyzed using standard voigt functions with subtracted backgrounds .",
    "the variation in the as / s - ratio with @xmath1 for each mode was then fitted to eq .",
    "[ pumpratio ] . for this purpose , it is convenient to modify the expression to :    @xmath108 , \\label{lnpumpratio}\\ ] ]    where @xmath109 , and @xmath110 which are the ( dimensionless ) fitted parameters .",
    "the @xmath6 s of the peaks ( necessary to obtain the cross sections ) are estimated in two different ways following the prescriptions in sec .",
    "iii b.    as discussed earlier , it is of critical importance that the sample remains stable over the entire length of the experiment .",
    "a range of integration times were used depending on the specific sample and measurement to achieve a good signal to noise ratio for different peaks , but power densities were kept to a minimum compatible with the observation of pumping and exposure to the beam was minimized as much as possible in between changes of @xmath1 .",
    "we used @xmath111 spread over the 20 @xmath105 m diameter spot .",
    "as the rate of photo - bleaching may change with @xmath1@xcite a suitable power density to ensure reasonable stability must be decided at rt , where the effect is greatest .",
    "the relatively large spot and low power densities have the triple advantage of ( @xmath67 ) reducing photo - bleaching to a negligible level , ( @xmath112 ) reducing any indirect laser heating effects and ( @xmath113 ) improving the averaging over cluster geometries . still , even under low power density excitation",
    ", the choice of laser line can have an important effect on the measurement .",
    "an explicit example is shown in fig .",
    "[ photobleach ] for rh6 g under @xmath114 excitation .",
    "as explained in the caption , this observation is compatible with a bleaching of the hs s with largest cross sections .",
    "laser lines that are strongly resonant with the probe molecule@xcite should be avoided so that the photo - stability of the analyte and the accumulated exposure to the laser do not become an issue in the interpretation and analysis of the data .",
    "for that reason , we only concentrate hereafter on results obtained with the @xmath115 and @xmath116 lines of a kr@xmath117-laser .",
    "these two lines are close enough to the visible ( to profit fully from sers enhancements ) but , by the same token , they do not produce excessive photo - bleaching for the dyes under consideration here .",
    "having all the theoretical tools from the previous sections , we can now easily scan through several experimental results that demonstrate the method in practice .",
    "figure [ tdeps ] shows the as / s - ratios ( ln(@xmath26 ) ) vs. @xmath1 , as measured using the @xmath118 line , for four modes of each of the investigated analytes .",
    "the solid lines represent the best fit to the experimental values using eq .",
    "[ lnpumpratio ] . a series of small imperfections can be seen in the data for some modes , but overall the behavior is very well represented by eq .",
    "[ lnpumpratio ] , with rh6 g being the best example .",
    "the arrows indicate the cross - over points @xmath119 between the thermally - dominated and pumping - dominated regimes for all the investigated modes .",
    "@xmath50 occurs at higher @xmath1 s for higher energy modes , as expected .",
    "the fact that pumping is observed for each of the modes indicates that the effect is fairly general and should be observable for a large number of analytes for as long as @xmath10 is high enough to make pumping observable at moderate power densities@xcite .    in order to transform these data into estimates of the cross sections we need to address the different methods of estimating @xmath6 .",
    "table [ tab : fitsigmas ] shows the experimental results for rh6 g taken with the @xmath116 line . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we display the cross section by using two different estimations of the @xmath6 s .",
    "this gives a better idea of how reliable these numbers are and how differences among them should be interpreted .",
    "table [ tab : fitsigmas ] shows both : @xmath2 the extraction of @xmath6 directly from the widths via @xmath120 ( this normally renders cross sections which are not fully consistent with the relative integrated intensities of the peaks ) , and @xmath5 the extraction of @xmath6 from the highest raman active mode and the subsequent adjustment of the other cross - sections to agree with the relative integrated intensities ( as described in sec .",
    "iii b ) . a column with relative intensities and cross - sections among modes",
    "is also provided for completeness .",
    "the anti - stokes cross sections are obtained through the stokes ones via the fitted value of the asymmetry parameter @xmath24 from eq .",
    "[ lnpumpratio ] .",
    "these results prove the point that the estimation of the lifetime is a crucial step in this method to transform the experimental values into an estimation of the cross sections themselves .",
    "the values should be interpreted within this assumption , and their validity should be assessed on a case - by - case basis .",
    "the preferred ( more consistent ) method is of course the one that ensures the relative cross sections agree with the relative intensities of peaks ( clm in sec .",
    "iii b ) .",
    "finally , we can discuss the effect of estimating the cross sections for two different excitation wavelengths .",
    "the experiment is somewhat restricted in the choice of excitations ( to be compatible with photo - stability ) but still provides a hint of resonance contributions to the cross sections with some limitations .",
    "table [ tab : fitsigmasall ] shows the cross - sections obtained for rh6 g , dodc , and cv for 647 and @xmath116 excitations for different modes .",
    "all the cross sections were obtained by the clm analysis .",
    "it is worth noting that in this latter method we only need ( in principle ) one temperature dependent as / s - ratio for the highest raman active mode ( judged to be dominated by population relaxation ) .",
    "this together with the plain sers spectrum of the dye is enough to estimate all the cross sections of the modes via the relative integrated intensities .",
    "the results will be consistent ( by construction ) but not necessarily accurate ( depending on the one mode that has been chosen to estimate the initial cross section ) .",
    "the main conclusions of these experiments can be summarized as follows : @xmath2 rh6 g shows larger cross - sections at 647 than at @xmath116 .",
    "this is consistent with a resonant increase known to exist in rh6 g towards the yellow part of the spectrum@xcite .",
    "@xmath5 on the contrary , both dodc and cv experience larger cross - sections at @xmath121 , consistent with the maximum of the absorption of these dyes being at longer wavelengths with respect to rh6 g and , therefore , having a much more red - shifted resonant interaction than rh6g@xcite .",
    "@xmath55 although there is some variations from mode to mode , it is generally true that cv experiences the largest cross - sections in this near - ir region .",
    "the numbers in tables [ tab : fitsigmas ] and [ tab : fitsigmasall ] deserve a special comment regarding their interpretation . for a start , the main source of error in these numbers ( as pointed out in the caption of table [ tab : fitsigmas ] ) is _ systematic _ rather than statistical , and comes from the different methods used in the estimation of @xmath6 .",
    "error bars for these systematic errors are not easy to obtain from the data , for they depend on the relative contribution to the fwhm of population relaxation and dephasing , which is unknown and changes from mode to mode .",
    "the number of significant figures is decided then by the range in which these numbers span for a given group of modes and laser excitation .",
    "it only makes sense to compare statistical errors ( from the propagation of errors in the parameters of the fits and the experimental magnitudes ) for two cross sections with the same systematic errors .",
    "this is the situation , for example , of the comparison between the method presented in this paper and the power - dependence method ( quadratic dependence of the @xmath28 signal as a function of power ) as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this latter case",
    "the same systematic error coming from the estimation of @xmath6 affects both results and , hence , the statistical error bars are meaningful to claim consistency or inconsistency between the two values . in any other case ,",
    "the overriding source of error in these estimates of the cross sections is systematic .",
    "the order of magnitude of these numbers deserves a special comment too .",
    "according to the results in sec .",
    "iii d , we expect these numbers to represent something close to the maximum available enhancement in these samples .",
    "in addition , the fact that @xmath6 could be in general underestimated by any of the methods presented here leads automatically to an overestimation of @xmath54 .",
    "last but not least , the values of @xmath48 are obtained from those of @xmath47 via the asymmetry factor @xmath24 . as a consequence of all these , we expect the values to be : @xmath2 at the higher - end of what is known for hs s in sers for @xmath47 and , @xmath5 with a larger error for the anti - stokes values which use the estimation of the asymmetry parameter @xmath122 two times ; once to obtain @xmath47 itself through the fit of @xmath123 vs. @xmath1 , and twice to obtain @xmath48 from @xmath47 . indeed ,",
    "table [ tab : fitsigmasall ] shows that cross - sections are at the higher - end of what is commonly accepted for sers enhancements .",
    "@xmath48 is bound to be less exact than @xmath47 because it depends crucially on the asymmetry parameter and its associated errors ( treated in sec .",
    "the most consistent set of values are obtained for @xmath47 using the clm - analysis ( which should be the preferred option ) and are all of the order of @xmath124 . in exceptional cases ,",
    "cross sections of the order of @xmath125 are obtained , which are still expected if we take into account that the estimation is for hs s and that the values are possibly overestimated by the choice of @xmath6 .",
    "unrealistically large values of @xmath47 beyond that should be interpreted as a limitation of the technique , in general , and should be tracked down to a problem in the assignment of @xmath6 for that mode .",
    "even for these cases , it is still possible to compare @xmath126 ( or @xmath127 ) for the same modes in different substrates providing a relative comparison of cross section performances at hs s without any additional assumptions .",
    "this comparison is independent of the number of molecules involved in the signal , due to the self - normalizing nature of the method .",
    "table [ tab : fitsigmasall ] summarizes , therefore , a typical example where the performance of different dyes can be tested through appropriate estimates of the cross sections derived from the method presented in this paper .",
    "we have presented an in - depth discussion of the state - of - the - art of sers cross section estimation via vibrational pumping and have given several experimental examples of it . despite the approximations needed and the intrinsic problems of the technique , it is still an excellent tool ( and in many cases possibly the only tool ) to extract an estimation of the sers cross - sections in situations where the number of molecules and hot - spots present in the sample are not known or are difficult to estimate .",
    "the _ self - normalizing _ nature of the method ( with respect to the number of molecules involved ) is certainly a major advantage .",
    "in addition , we feel that these latter experimental and theoretical developments have moved forward to establish vibrational pumping as a real phenomenon in sers after almost a decade of controversy about its very existence .",
    "one outstanding issue that surely deserves further investigation is the effect of photo - bleaching under sers conditions ( in particular in hs ) . as we showed in sec .",
    "iii d , the fact that this technique produces an estimate of the cross sections which is heavily biased towards hs s provides a unique opportunity to explore their characteristics .",
    "this is particularly true in the comparison among different substrates ( in which the photo - stability of the analyte plays a special role ) .",
