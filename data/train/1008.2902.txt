    "[ sec:1 ]    kondo effect in electronic transport through quantum dots ( qds ) strongly coupled to external leads is a many body phenomenon which has been extensively studied in the last two decades@xcite .",

    "the enhanced transmission is suppressed when a bias voltage is applied , and this leads to the so - called zero - bias ( kondo ) anomaly in differential conductance .",
    "the above described phenomenon arises from the two - fold spin degeneracy , and is often referred to as the spin kondo effect .",

    "such a behavior stems from the fact that the rate of tunneling events leading to the kondo resonance decreases since the dot qd1 becomes detached from the leads as @xmath33 decreases .",

    "then , we used the slave boson technique to calculate local density of states and linear conductance . to find nonlinear conductance we used the nonequillibrium green function method .",
    "the numerical results show that transport characteristics reveal typical kondo phenomenon , similar to that observed in a single quantum dot with spin degenerate discrete level , coupled to external ferromagnetic leads . in the case",
    "considered , the splitting due to level renormalization could be compensated by external gate voltages , so one could reach the full kondo anomaly . such a compensation , however , is not possible when the direct tunneling between the dots is strong .",
    "the author is extremely gratefull to prof .",
    "j. barna for fruitful discussions and would like to thank him for giving helpful advices during preparation of the manuscript .",
    "this work , as part of the european science foundation eurocores programme spintra , was supported by funds from the ministry of science and higher education as a research project in years 2006 - 2009 and the ec sixth framework programme , under contract n. eras - ct-2003 - 980409 .",
    "the author also acknowledges support by funds from ministry of science and higher education as a research project n n202 169536 in years 2009 - 2011 .",
    "here we show explicit form of the derived dots green functions @xmath165 for @xmath166 ;              @xmath186 with @xmath187 $ ] , @xmath188 , @xmath189 for @xmath190 and @xmath191 for @xmath192 .",
    "the self energy @xmath193 is the self energy of the noninteracting system , i.e. , @xmath194 in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) .",
    "although , presented here eom approach gives qualitatively good ( physical ) results around @xmath84 , it breaks down ( both qualitatively and quantitatively ) at lower temperatures ( especially at @xmath195 ) .",
    "we must point out that the drawbacks in eom method are due to the logarithmic divergence of the digamma function .",
    "detailed analysis can be found in ref .",
    ". here , we only list them briefly .",
    "specifically , the divergence of the digamma function leads to wrong behavior of the linear conductance ( density of states at the fermi level)@xcite .",
    "slave - boson calculations ( which are exact at t=0k ) show that the conductance saturates as the dot s level is decreased ( see fig.[fig:3 ] ) .",
    "this is no longer true for eom approaches , where below certain dot s level position the conductance starts to decrease@xcite .",
    "the eom methods , with different decoupling schemes@xcite , also do not conserve completeness relation as well as not satisfy friedel sum rule@xcite .",
    "however , the decoupling schemes considered in our work somehow give surprisingly good dependence of the dot s occupation numbers as a function of the impurity level position ( similar to those obtained by numerical renormalization group method@xcite ) .",
    "taking all above into account one should remember that presented here eom method leads to incorrect predictions at low temperatures and is limited to @xmath196 as we stated in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "however , the eom methods have an advantage on the other techniques used to investigate kondo problem .",
    "specifically , it enables to explore the non - equilibrium phenomena present in qds systems biased by a finite voltage difference attached to the external leads .",
