    "the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission was measured with the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) on the compton gamma ray observatory up to about 20 gev .",
    "to first approximation it can be described by a suitable model for the diffuse interstellar gas , the galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) distribution , and the diffuse photon fields @xcite .",
    "the resulting gcr distribution in the milky way essentially corresponds to that measured in situ in the local neighborhood of the solar system .",
    "this is also our starting point .",
    "however above about 1  gev the observed average diffuse @xmath0-ray intensity in the inner galaxy , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , exceeds the model prediction significantly , and this excess appears to increase monotonically with @xmath0-ray energy .",
    "spatially , the diffuse @xmath0-ray intensity is strongly increasing towards the galactic midplane .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as paper i ) , we have calculated the contribution of an unresolved distribution of cr sources to the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux in the disk , assuming the gcr distribution within its large confinement volume to be the same as that measured in situ .",
    "the cr sources contribute through the @xmath0-ray emission of the accelerated particles that are confined in their interior  the source cosmic rays ( scrs ) .",
    "it was assumed that supernova remnants ( snrs ) are the dominant sources of the gcrs . on this premise",
    "it was found that the scrs give an important contribution to the diffuse high - energy @xmath0-ray emission at low galactic latitudes . since the cr energy spectrum inside snrs is much harder than on average in the galaxy",
    " the average spectrum being softened by rigidity - dependent escape from the galaxy in the diffusion / convection region above the disk  the relative snr contribution increases with energy and was found to become in fact dominant at @xmath0-ray energies @xmath7  gev .",
    "this led to a substantial increase of the `` diffuse '' tev @xmath0-ray emission from the galactic disk so as to constitute a significant observational background .",
    "this hard - spectrum background must also be taken into account in the search for spatially extended galactic cr sources above the gev region .",
    "extending paper i we take into account here that a significant fraction of the snr population , the type ii and ib supernovae ( sne ) with progenitor masses in excess of @xmath8 , expand into a nonuniform circumstellar medium strongly modified by the wind from the progenitor star . in such snrs",
    "the majority of crs should be produced in a thin dense shell of swept - up ism . as a consequence of the high density of this shell the expected @xmath9-decay @xmath0-ray emission with energies",
    "@xmath10  gev is shown to be an order of magnitude larger than for an identical explosion into a uniform ism .",
    "this gives a natural explanation for the observed diffuse @xmath0-ray excess for energies @xmath11  gev .",
    "we also consider in detail the contribution of the high - energy scr electrons to the high energy @xmath0-ray background due to inverse compton ( ic ) scattering on the background photon field . since the energy spectrum of the scr electrons",
    "is strongly influenced by synchrotron losses , the ic @xmath0-ray emission depends on the effective magnetic field strength in the snr interior .",
    "this field may in turn be amplified relative to the external field by the acceleration process itself @xcite .",
    "we take such a field amplification into account as an average property of snrs relative to the contribution from the gcrs . as demonstrated below , this results in an order of magnitude increase of the galactic @xmath0-ray emission at tev - energies . in a preliminary form",
    "these results have been presented in @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that a detailed measurement of the low - latitude diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray spectrum within the energy interval from 1 to @xmath12  gev will constitute an important indirect test for the gcr origin from the _ population _ of galactic snrs as a whole .",
    "the majority of the gcrs with charge number z , at least up to kinetic energies @xmath13  ev , is presumably accelerated in snrs .",
    "individual examples , where this is the case , are the objects sn 1006 @xcite and cas a @xcite . according to theory a significant part of the hydrodynamic sn explosion energy @xmath14  erg is converted into crs already in the early sedov phase of the evolution , @xmath15  yr , as a result of diffusive shock acceleration @xcite . later on the total cr energy content @xmath16 and",
    "therefore the @xmath0-ray production slowly varies with time .",
    "we neglect this variation in the energetics in our considerations below , assuming a time - independent scr energy content @xmath17 , consistent with the gcr energy budget requirement .",
    "the total number of active snrs , @xmath18 , is an increasing function of their assumed life time @xmath19  yr , i.e. the time until which they can confine the main fraction of the accelerated particles . here",
    "yr is the galactic sn rate .",
    "consequently we conclude that the population of the oldest snrs should dominate the total @xmath0-ray luminosity of the ensemble of galactic snrs .",
    "approximately we shall therefore consider only snrs in the sedov phase of their evolution in our estimate of the total @xmath0-ray luminosity .",
    "gamma - ray producing crs in the galaxy are then the sum of two basically different populations .",
    "the first one consists of the ordinary gcrs and presumably occupies a large galactic residence volume quasi - uniformly .",
    "this residence volume exceeds by far the volume of the gas disk which harbors the cr sources @xcite .",
    "the second cr population are the scrs in the localized snrs .    during the initial , active period of snr evolution at times",
    "@xmath21 when the sn shock is relatively strong , the volume occupied by the accelerated crs practically coincides with the shock volume . during later evolutionary stages the shock becomes weak and crs begin to leave the snr acceleration region .",
    "after some period of time the escaping scrs become very well mixed with the ambient gcrs .",
    "thus the controling factor is the shock strength .",
    "the @xmath0-ray production by the gcrs is quite well studied @xcite .",
    "therefore we shall concentrate on the relative contribution of the scr population .",
    "it was shown in paper i that the total @xmath0-ray spectrum measured from an arbitrary galactic disk volume is expected to be @xmath22 ,   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the @xmath9-decay @xmath0-ray spectrum due to gcrs and the additional factor 0.4 is introduced to approximately take into account the contribution of gcr electron component to the diffuse @xmath0-ray emission at gev energies @xcite .",
    "for the ratio @xmath24 of the @xmath0-ray production rates due to scrs and gcrs we have @xmath25 with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the gas number density in the galactic disk and inside snrs , respectively , @xmath29 is the ratio of the ic to @xmath9-decay @xmath0-ray production rates due to the scrs , @xmath30 is the proton scr confinement time , and the difference between the spectral indices of the gcrs and the scrs is assumed to be 0.6 .    in the case of snrs",
    "expanding into a uniform ism @xmath30 , which is equal to the confinement time @xmath31 of the scr electron component if synchrotron losses are not more restrictive for electrons ( see below ) , is given by the expression @xmath32 where @xmath33  gev is the maximal energy of crs that can accelerated in snrs , and @xmath34 which is roughly valid for the hadronic @xmath0-ray production process .",
    "the decrease of the proton confinement time @xmath30 with energy @xmath35 is due to the diminishing ability of the snr shock to produce high - energy crs during the sedov phase .",
    "in fact , the highest cr energy @xmath35 and therefore the highest - energy @xmath0-ray production slowly decrease with time as @xmath36 which implies the escape of the highest energy crs from the snr @xcite .",
    "since it was shown in paper i that electron scrs give a @xmath0-ray contribution comparable with that of the nuclear scrs , we consider the electron emission here in greater detail . in the relevant energy range",
    "the @xmath0-ray luminosity due to the electron ic scattering on the background photons can be described in the thompson limit @xcite .",
    "since the electron spectrum in a snr depends significantly on the snr age @xmath37 due to synchrotron losses , we first determine the @xmath0-ray production rate @xmath38 due to one snr of age @xmath37 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy of electrons which produce an ic photon with mean energy @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mean energy and number density of the background photons , respectively . finally @xmath45 denotes the spatial electron scr number density averaged over the galactic disk volume @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of snrs of age between @xmath37 and @xmath48 which contribute to the ic emission at energy @xmath41 from cr electron sources .",
    "the source electron spectrum at energies @xmath49 , where synchrotron losses are not important , can be represented in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the electron to proton ratio and @xmath52 is the total number of scr protons per snr in the energy interval d@xmath35 . finally @xmath53 is the low energy limit of that part of the electron spectrum which is modified by the synchrotron losses , and @xmath54 is the magnetic field strength inside the snrs . for @xmath55",
    "the electron spectrum is steeper due to synchrotron losses : @xmath56 we also neglect the time dependence of the proton spectrum in snrs , since in the later sedov phase which is most important here , it is not significant , especially at high energies @xcite .",
    "the proton spectrum is taken in a power lower form @xmath57 with @xmath58 , consistent with the requirements for the sources of the galactic crs .",
    "the maximum energy of scr electrons is also restricted by their synchrotron losses during their acceleration at the snr shock : @xmath59 if @xmath60 ; here @xmath61 is the shock speed . at the beginning of the sedov phase ( @xmath62  yr ) the shock speed is about @xmath63  km / s and subsequently decreases as @xmath64 . therefore the electron confinement time",
    "can be written in the form @xmath65 the total ic @xmath0-ray production rate due to all existing snrs can be determined by the expression @xmath66 first we normalize @xmath67 to the production rate of @xmath9-decay @xmath0-rays .from inelastic cr - gas collisions , primarily p - p collisions , which may be written in the form @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the local gas number density , @xmath70 is the inelastic p - p cross - section , @xmath71 is the so - called spectrum - weighted moment of the inelastic cross - section , @xmath72 is the spatial number density of scrs averaged over the galactic volume @xmath46 , and @xmath73 is the speed of light .",
    "then , performing the integration over all possible snr ages , we find the ratio of luminosities : @xmath74 for @xmath0-ray energies @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the energy of @xmath0-rays .which are emitted by electrons with synchrotron loss time equal to @xmath31 .",
    "the value @xmath79 was used , which corresponds to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "due to the rather hard scr electron spectrum the dominant contribution to the ic radiation comes from collisions with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons which are characterized by @xmath80  @xmath81 and @xmath82  ev . the far infrared radiation ( fir ) field with @xmath83",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath84  ev contributes about 20% for @xmath85  gev . in the case of the fir background",
    "the klein - nishina cross - section must be used instead of the thomson limit at tev @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "we take account of the klein - nishina decrease of the cross - section at high energies through multiplying @xmath86 by the correction factor @xmath87 which approximately describes the reduction effect @xcite . for @xmath88",
    "tev , @xmath89 for the fir contribution .",
    "bremsstrahlung @xmath0-rays .play no role for the average @xmath0-ray background above gev energies , if @xmath90 ( paper i ) .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we present a calculated @xmath0-ray spectrum based on the above expressions ( [ eq1])([eq17 ] ) with @xmath91  yr , @xmath92  @xmath4 g , @xmath93  gev , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "a scr power law index @xmath58 and a 10 percent efficiency of scr production in snr , required to account for the gcrs , were used .",
    "one can see that the scr contribution becomes dominant for @xmath85  gev where the expected @xmath0-ray spectrum becomes extremely hard . at tev energies the predicted flux exceeds the lowest hegra upper limit @xcite almost by a factor of two .",
    "the scr electron contribution increases with energy @xmath41 and exceeds the proton scr contribution for energies @xmath96  gev . at @xmath97",
    "tev electron scrs contribute about 60% of the total @xmath0-ray flux .",
    "therefore at these high energies the expected @xmath0-ray emissivity of snrs is only weakly dependent on the most relevant parameter , the maximum confinement time @xmath2 , since according to expressions ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) we have for @xmath98  tev @xmath99 taking into account that at this energy @xmath100 . even if @xmath2 is as short as @xmath101  yr , the expected scr contribution at tev energies is therefore only 30% lower and still exceeds the gcr contribution by more than an order of magnitude ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that in the latter case the scr contribution is entirely due to the electrons : they radiate about 85% of the tev @xmath0-rays .. this extreme case has to be considered as the lowest value for the scr contribution to the galactic @xmath0-ray background radiation , since there are no other ways to decrease it .",
    "this holds in particular also for the average gas number density @xmath28 inside snrs because the ic @xmath0-ray production rate does not depend on it . such a short confinement time",
    "@xmath3  yr @xcite could be realized in a scenario where a strong amplification of the magnetic field @xmath54 in snrs is balanced by nonlinear wave - wave interactions such that the wave magnetic power @xmath102 in the spatial scale @xmath103 is dissipated in a ( minimal ) eddy turnover time @xmath104 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath105^{1/2}$ ] is the rms - value of the plasma mass velocity at scale @xmath103 , and @xmath106 denotes the alfv@xmath107n velocity .",
    "we also point out that the restriction of the electron confinement time @xmath31 due to their synchrotron losses becomes significant for @xmath0-ray energies",
    "@xmath108  tev and leads to the steepening of the @xmath0-ray spectrum ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "according to fig.[fig1 ] , for energies @xmath109 to 4  tev the expected differential @xmath0-ray energy spectrum from the central part of the galaxy has the form @xmath110 with power law index @xmath111 and amplitude @xmath112  ( @xmath113 s sr tev)@xmath114 , depending on the confinement time @xmath2 .    as one can see from fig.[fig1 ] , the @xmath0-ray flux expected for @xmath91  yr at @xmath115  tev exceeds the hegra upper limit @xcite and the preliminary flux measured by the milagro detector @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here that we have multiplied the milagro flux by a factor of 3 since we present the expected @xmath0-ray flux from the region @xmath116 whereas the milagro data correspond to @xmath117 .",
    "even for @xmath118  yr the expected flux exceeds the milagro data .",
    "the only physical parameter which strongly influences the ic @xmath0-ray production rate is the snr magnetic field @xmath54 : according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq15])([eq16 ] ) @xmath119 . a value of @xmath54 that is significantly higher than @xmath92",
    "@xmath4 g can be attributed to field amplification at the shock front due to the strong wave production by the acceleration of crs far into the nonlinear regime @xcite .    in fig.[fig2",

    "therefore the contribution of the hadronic scrs to the @xmath0-ray flux becomes much more significant : at tev - energies and for @xmath91  yr the @xmath9-decay @xmath0-rays .exceed the ic @xmath0-rays .by a factor of 2.5 , whereas for @xmath121  yr the ic @xmath0-rays .still exceed the @xmath9-decay @xmath0-rays .by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "one can see that in this case the expected @xmath0-ray flux is below the hegra and tibet upper limits already for a scr confinement time @xmath91  yr . the expected @xmath0-ray spectrum at energies @xmath122  tev is characterized by @xmath123 and @xmath124  ( @xmath113 s sr tev)@xmath114 , which also considerably exceeds the gcr contribution .",
    "note that since the maximum energy of scrs obeys @xmath125 , it is larger by a factor of three compared with the previous case . taking into account the uncertainty of the milagro flux",
    "one can conclude that this measurement does not contradict our prediction for the case of the amplified magnetic field .",
    "the lower value of the confinement time @xmath3  yr might be preferable in this sense .",
    "the above consideration corresponds to the assumption that all existing galactic snrs expand into a uniform circumstellar medium with a density of @xmath126  @xmath81 . however , for stellar masses in excess of about 15 @xmath127 the progenitors of type ii and ib sne can strongly modify their environment through their ionizing radiation and very energetic winds @xcite . disregarding large - scale turbulent mixing processes in the sequel , the stellar wind from such a star creates a low - density bubble beyond the termination shock out to a radius @xmath128 , bounded by a dense swept - up shell of interstellar material .",
    "the radius of the wind bubble can be several tens of parsecs .",
    "the very hot dilute bubble contains a small amount of mass , typically a few solar masses or even less , whereas the thin swept - up shell ultimately contains thousands of solar masses .",
    "this shell will have a gradual inner boundary where localized mixing of bubble and shell material proceeds . since the typical sn ejecta mass is about @xmath129 for massive progenitors , only a relatively small fraction of the sn explosion energy @xmath130",
    "is transformed into internal gas and cr energy during the sn shock propagation through the bubble and the main part of sn energy is deposited in the shell .",
    "there are no physical reasons for which the cr production process in the shell matter is substantially different from that in the uniform ism case , apart from the different distribution of ion injection across the snr shock surface due to the magnetic field geometry @xcite .",
    "the major difference which plays a role for the @xmath9-decay @xmath0-rays .is that crs accelerated during the sn shock propagation through the shell are confined in a medium which is more than a factor of ten denser than the average ism in the galactic disk , of density @xmath131 .",
    "this may lead to an appreciable increase of the overall @xmath0-ray production .",
    "in addition , the snr shock evolves differently than in the case of a uniform circumstellar medium .",
    "the entire active period of snr evolution , when the sn shock is strong enough and effectively produces crs , takes place within the shell of thickness @xmath132 which is much smaller than its radius , @xmath133 .",
    "this implies that during the entire active evolution the snr shock size @xmath134 remains nearly constant .",
    "the time dependence of the shock speed @xmath61 which is very important for the scr confinement in snrs can then be estimated as follows .",
    "the majority of the progenitor stars with an intense wind are main - sequence stars with initial masses @xmath135 @xcite . in the mean , during their evolution in the surrounding uniform ism of gas number density @xmath136",
    ", they create a bubble of size @xcite @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the mass - loss rate of the presupernova star , @xmath139 is the wind speed , and @xmath140 is the duration of the wind period .    in order to determine the sn shock dynamics inside the shell we model the gas number density distribution in the bubble and in the shell in the form @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the peak number density in the shell , @xmath143 is the gas number density inside the bubble , typically very small compared with the shell density , and @xmath144 is the shell compression ratio .",
    "the mass of the bubble @xmath145 is about @xmath146 , whereas the shell mass @xmath147 is a few thousands of solar masses .",
    "therefore , during snr shock propagation through the bubble , only a small fraction of its energy is given to gas of stellar origin .",
    "the main part of the explosion energy is deposited in the shell .    as in the case of a uniform ism",
    "the evolution of the sn shock can be represented as a sequence of two stages .",
    "the first stage is the free expansion phase which continues up to the time , when the shock sweeps up a mass equal to the ejecta mass @xmath148 .",
    "the second phase is analogous to the sedov phase in the uniform ism .",
    "the only significant difference compared with the uniform ism case is that at the end of the free expansion phase , when a large part of the sn energy has been given to the swept up gas , the shock volume is much larger .    when the swept - up mass becomes large compared to the sum of bubble mass and @xmath148 , the sn shock propagation in the shell medium with density @xmath149 can be shown to approach the following self - similar adiabatic solution @xmath150 which corresponds to an expansion law @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "the shock decelerates much more rapidly in this case , @xmath153 , than in the case of a uniform ism , where @xmath154 . due to the fact that @xmath155 we have approximately @xmath156 . during this period of time",
    "the shock size and the amount of the swept - up mass are connected by the relation @xmath157 substituting in this expression the sn ejecta mass @xmath148 we get the value of the sn shock size which corresponds to the end of free expansion phase @xmath158 at this epoch the shock speed is roughly the mean ejecta speed @xmath159 therefore the corresponding time scale is @xmath160 .    as it follows from the expansion law and from eq.([eq24 ] ) , the snr shock reaches the edge of the shell @xmath161 at time @xmath162 which for @xmath163 gives @xmath164 at about this stage the snr shock has lost much of its speed and will come into pressure equilibrium with its environment , i.e. @xmath165 .    for the typical values @xmath166/yr , @xmath167  km / s , @xmath168  yr , which correspond to a progenitor of mass @xmath169 @xcite and @xmath126  @xmath81 , we have @xmath170  pc and @xmath171 . for @xmath172  erg and @xmath173",
    "this gives @xmath174  yr and @xmath175  yr . the ambient interstellar gas may also be photoionized which implies a large enough external pressure to stop bubble expansion at a lower radius @xcite .",
    "therefore we also consider below the case @xmath176  pc which corresponds to @xmath177  yr .",
    "according to theory , the expanding snr shock produces a power law cr spectrum up to a maximum energy @xcite @xmath178 which is determined by the radius @xmath134 and speed @xmath61 of the shock .",
    "the crs with the highest energy @xmath179 are produced at the very beginning of the sedov phase @xmath180 when the product @xmath181 has its maximum .",
    "subsequently , the product @xmath181 decreases with time approximately as @xmath182 and the snr shock produces crs with progressively lower cutoff energy @xmath183 . during that phase those crs that were previously produced with energies @xmath184",
    "now leave the remnant without a significant influence of the snr shock .",
    "therefore the cr confinement time has to be taken in the form @xmath185 where according to the above consideration @xmath186 .",
    "this relation is analogous to eq.([eq3 ] ) in the case of a uniform ism and leads to an increase of the spectral index of the @xmath0-ray emission by one unit .    in order to estimate the highest energy of",
    "accelerated crs in this case we use the relation @xmath187 . compared with the case of a uniform ism , where @xmath188  pc for @xmath126  @xmath81 , the value of @xmath189 is about ten times larger but @xmath190 is the same .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath191 on the other hand is much lower than in the case of a sn  ia . indeed , as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) , the gas number density at the beginning of the sedov phase is as small as @xmath192 .",
    "the magnetic field in the region of the shell is presumably adiabatically compressed interstellar field @xmath193 . if we approximate the directions of @xmath193 as being isotropic , then its magnitude scales with the gas density like @xmath194 , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this gives a field strength @xmath195 .",
    "taking into account all the factors considered , we conclude that the maximum cr energy in the case of wind - sne with dense shells is roughly a factor of ten smaller than in the case of sne expanding into a uniform ism . assuming that the field amplification is proportional to @xmath196 , cf .",
    "@xcite , this amplification does not play a role here since @xmath197 is so low .",
    "in contrast to our previous study @xcite , where we considered the cr acceleration by sn shocks expanding into a _ modified",
    "_ bubble , we consider here the opposite extreme of bubble structure .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field suppresses the mass and heat transport between the dense shell and the hot bubble @xcite .",
    "therefore the bubble mass is so small that a significant number of crs is produced by the sn shock only when it enters the dense shell .",
    "even though it is not clear at the moment which of these two concepts is physically more correct , we consider here the possibility of an unmodified bubble , because of its great importance for @xmath0-ray production .",
    "we note that due to the energy dependence of the confinement time @xmath198 the scr contribution to the @xmath0-ray flux undergoes a spectral break at a @xmath0-ray energy which corresponds to the scr energy @xmath199 protons with energies @xmath200 survive up to the final active snr epoch @xmath201 and therefore provide the maximum contribution to the @xmath0-ray snr emissivity at @xmath202 , whereas for @xmath203 the @xmath0-ray emissivity decreases more steeply , to go to zero at @xmath204 .",
    "the gas number density @xmath28 in expression ( [ eq2 ] ) is a function of snr age @xmath37 for wind - sne , because the gas density @xmath205 seen by the sn shock changes during the evolution of the snr .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) that the gas density behind the sn shock , where most of the scrs are located , can be represented as @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the sn shock compression ratio .",
    "therefore the gas density seen by scrs of energy @xmath35 is @xmath208 since @xmath209 for @xmath203 , the @xmath0-ray spectrum produced in the shell is very steep at these high energies , and in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) we have @xmath210 .",
    "we assume that the progenitors of type ii sne are stars more massive than @xmath211 , and that only those with @xmath135 have strong winds which produce extended bubbles , e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is also true for the progenitor population of type ib sne .",
    "according to @xcite the initial mass function has the form @xmath212 with @xmath213 for the mass intervals",
    "@xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 , respectively . therefore the ratio of the number of stars whose initial mass @xmath218 exceeds 15  @xmath127 to those with @xmath219 is 0.23 . since about 85% of all sn explosions in the galaxy",
    "are type ii and type ib sne @xcite , and since in addition the explosion energies @xmath130 of type  ii and type  ib sne with @xmath135 are about two times larger than on average @xcite , we conclude that roughly a fraction @xmath220 of the total galactic sn energy release is from wind - sne with progenitors of masses @xmath135 which produce extended bubbles .",
    "therefore the expected @xmath0-ray snr luminosity should be weighted between the snr populations expanding into a uniform ism and into bubbles as follows : @xmath221 where @xmath222 corresponds to the ratio of @xmath0-ray production rates due to scrs and gcrs if all sne were exploding into a uniform ism , and @xmath223 is the corresponding ratio for explosions into bubbles .    assuming that wind - sne have rarefied bubbles with dense shells the spectrum of @xmath0-rays .calculated with the above ratio @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 is presented in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] by the full lines , which correspond to two different assumptions about the value of the scr confinement time @xmath2 .",
    "it is seen that the wind - sne dominate at energies @xmath228  gev and fit the egret data for @xmath229  yr fairly well , whereas for the larger confinement times @xmath91  yr their contribution becomes so large , that their calculated flux exceeds the egret data by about a factor of two .",
    "we emphasize that the contribution from the population of wind - sne is mainly due to the nuclear scr component .",
    "the break in the @xmath0-ray spectra presented in fig.[fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] is at @xmath230  gev for @xmath91  yr and at @xmath231  gev for @xmath229  yr . for larger energies",
    "the proton confinement time and the gas density become lower , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , which leads to a corresponding decrease of the wind - sn contribution to the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "this contribution becomes insignificant for @xmath97  tev .",
    "our above consideration is based upon a picture in which the population of snrs , considered here as the main gcr sources , are distributed across the galactic disk similar to the interstellar gas . in this case the calculated ratio @xmath234 of the scr to the gcr contribution does not depend upon the observing direction in the disk . since the number of these sources @xmath235 is very limited , their mean number within the field of view @xmath236   degrees of a stereoscopic system of imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes for @xmath0-ray energies @xmath237  gev is so low , that one should expect large fluctuations of the actual value of @xmath234 , especially for lines - of - sight other than those directed towards the inner galaxy .",
    "the actual snr distribution within the galactic disk most probably is not uniform . according to @xcite the sn explosion rate as a function of galactocentric radius @xmath238 has a peak at @xmath239  kpc and drops exponentially with a scale length of @xmath240  kpc . within @xmath241  kpc",
    "this agrees fairly well with the radial distributions of _ supernovae _ in a sample of 36 _ external galaxies _ of hubble type sb ",
    "sbc , statistically considered equivalent to our galaxy @xcite . from our results , for @xmath0-ray energies larger than 10 gev , the ratio @xmath224 , corrected for the nonuniform snr distribution , is then given by the ratio @xmath242 , where the parameter @xmath243 represents the ratio of the actual snr number along the given line - of - sight to that snr number which would corresponds to their uniform distribution .",
    "for lower @xmath0-ray energies , @xmath244  mev , where the truly diffuse emission from the gcrs dominates , it is known that the @xmath0-ray emissivity gradient is significantly shallower than the gradient of @xmath243 , as shown by the egret instrument on board of the cgro satellite @xcite in basic agreement with the results from the cos - b satellite @xcite .",
    "this much shallower , indeed truly diffuse galactocentric @xmath0-ray gradient can be understood as a nonlinear propagation effect from the disk into the galactic wind where the latter is driven by the gcrs themselves @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the radial galactocentric variation of the direct radiation from the sources is not smoothed by any propagation effect . therefore its amplitude should spatially vary like the distribution of the sources , integrated along the line - of - sight , and this variation should become directly measurable in the @xmath245  gev range .",
    "given several such line - of - sight integrals , one can infer the radial galactocentric @xmath0-ray emissivity gradient .",
    "the excellent angular resolution of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes and the high sensitivity of instruments like the cangaroo iii and h.e.s.s .",
    "arrays in the southern hemisphere , which at tev energies have an order of magnitude higher sensitivity compared with previous generation instruments like hegra @xcite , should allow this measurement in particular in the inner galaxy .",
    "the assumed average value @xmath246 g of the magnetic field inside snrs is considerably smaller than the value @xmath247 g inferred for e.g. sn  1006 in the very early sedov phase @xcite .",
    "however the amplification must be a monotonically increasing function of the shock strength .",
    "in particular , @xcite argue for a dependence @xmath248 .",
    "if so , then the effective amplified magnetic field in snrs varies from @xmath249  @xmath4 g at the beginning of the sedov phase to the typical interstellar value @xmath250",
    "@xmath4 g at the end of its active period @xmath251 .",
    "since the value of the magnetic field in snrs has a dominant influence on the ic @xmath0-ray spectrum , and since all evolutionary phases of a snr contribute to this spectrum in a roughly equal way , the adopted value @xmath120",
    "@xmath4 g appears to be quite realistic , averaging over the entire active period .",
    "one should also note that the snr magnetic field influences the maximum energy of scrs .",
    "since the most energetic scrs are created at the beginning of the sedov phase , their actual maximum energy @xmath252 is expected to be larger than considered here , because the amplified magnetic field @xmath191 in this phase is by a factor of several larger than on average .",
    "compared with the fig.[fig2 ] this effect will produce more a extended and smooth high energy tail of the @xmath0-ray spectrum up to the energy @xmath253  gev .",
    "the actual process of sn shock interaction with the dense shell could be much more complicated compared with the ideal picture considered here . if due to some physical factors ( inhomogeneities in the surrounding ism , instabilities ... ) the shell is _ always",
    "_ strongly distorted , then one would expect that the sn shock will penetrate through the shell more rapidly .",
    "this will lead to a decrease of the propagation time @xmath254 and/or to the decrease of the effective gas number density @xmath28 , that in turn will decrease the amount of @xmath0-rays .produced in such types of snrs .",
    "in other words , the calculated @xmath0-ray spectrum at @xmath10  gev ( see fig.[fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] ) , which is mainly due to the wind sne , has to be considered as an upper limit , which corresponds to the case of stable unmodified bubbles .",
    "our considerations demonstrate that the scrs inevitably make a strong contribution to the `` diffuse '' @xmath0-ray flux from the galactic disk at all energies above a few gev , if the population of snrs is the main source of the gcrs . according to our estimates",
    ", the scr contribution dominates at energies greater than 100  gev due to its substantially harder spectrum .",
    "there are two physical parameters which influence the expected @xmath0-ray emission from snrs significantly : the cr confinement time and the mean magnetic field strength @xmath54 inside the snrs .",
    "for a conventional value @xmath92",
    "@xmath4 g the expected @xmath0-ray flux from snrs exceeds the hegra upper limit considerably if the scr confinement time is as large as @xmath91  yr .",
    "this contradiction can be resolved either if we suggest an appreciably higher postshock magnetic field @xmath255  @xmath4 g or if the scr confinement time is as small as @xmath3  yr , or a combination of both effects .",
    "these possibilities can be attributed to field amplification by the scrs themselves .",
    "in fact , nonlinear field amplification may also lead to a substantial decrease of the scr confinement time : according to @xcite maximal turbulent alfv@xmath107n wave damping with its corresponding increase of cr mobility could make the scr confinement time as small as @xmath256  yr . under these circumstances the most realistic @xmath0-ray background spectrum",
    "is represented by the thick solid line in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "one can see that even in the case of @xmath257  @xmath4 g and @xmath258  yr the snr contribution at tev energies , with roughly numbers of ic and @xmath9-decay @xmath0-rays .",
    ", still exceeds the gcr contribution almost by an order of magnitude .",
    "note that the preliminary @xmath0-ray flux at @xmath115  tev , measured by the milagro detector @xcite , confirms our earlier prediction @xcite .    at lower energies",
    "@xmath10  gev the @xmath0-ray emission from snrs is dominated by the wind - sne with initial progenitor mass @xmath135 which expand into the bubble created by the progenitor s wind , under the assumption that the bubble is not modified by global heat and mass transport .",
    "the main fraction of the crs is produced in this case when the sn shock propagates through the thin dense shell at the edge of the bubble . due to",
    "the significantly higher mass density of the shell material compared with the mean gas density in the galactic disk @xmath9-decay @xmath0-rays .dominate at @xmath0-ray energies @xmath10  gev despite the fact that only about 20% of all snrs belong to this class of objects . as shown in figs.[fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the discrepancy between the observed `` diffuse '' intensity and standard model predictions at energies above a few gev can be attributed to the scr contribution .",
    "this requires unmodified bubbles for the wind - sne .",
    "since we can not prove this assumption , the corresponding explanation of the lower energy @xmath0-ray excess is not a definitive conclusion , but rather a plausible suggestion which must await more detailed studies of wind bubble morphologies .",
    "we conclude that a detailed measurement of the low - latitude `` diffuse '' galactic @xmath0-ray _ spectrum _ within the energy interval from 1 to @xmath12  gev will allow a strong consistency check for the predominant origin of the galactic cosmic rays from the galactic population of snrs as a whole . in the energy range above a few 100",
    "gev our predictions are quite robust resulting in a hard spectrum whose galactocentric variation should correspond to that of the observed snr distribution . if the preliminary milagro data , which agree with our prediction , are confirmed by more precise measurements , then such measurements will give an indirect confirmation of snrs as the main sources of gcrs .",
    "the measurements will also give a new tool to study the spatial distribution of snrs in the galaxy .",
