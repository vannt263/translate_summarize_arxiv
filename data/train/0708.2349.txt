    "in this paper we study a well - known combinatorial model of determinantal point processes in dimension 1 + 1 ( one spatial and one time variable ) .",
    "the model depends on 3 positive integers @xmath0 and is given by the uniform distribution on the finite set @xmath1 of combinatorial objects that can be described in several equivalent ways : 3d young diagrams ( in other words plane partitions ) in an @xmath2 box ; tilings of the hexagon of side lengths @xmath3 by rhombi of three types ; and a dimer model on the honeycomb lattice ( see e.g. cohn  larsen - propp @xcite , johansson @xcite , johansson",
    " nordenstam @xcite ) .",
    "correspondences between different models can be found in the appendix .",
    "following johansson , we use yet another model where @xmath1 is identified with the ensemble of non - intersecting polygonal paths on the plane lattice .",
    "the latter model leads to determinantal point processes ( put it otherwise , random point configurations ) varying over time .",
    "the determinantal property , which is of crucial importance , means that dynamical ( i.e. space - time ) correlation functions of the model can be obtained as minors of some matrix which is called dynamical correlation kernel .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compute the asymptotics of this kernel in the `` bulk limit '' regime .    for a fixed time moment",
    "our model provides a random point configuration on the one - dimensional lattice  the so - called hahn orthogonal polynomial ensemble .",
    "the dynamical model can be described as a chain of such ensembles with varying parameters , thus it can be called a dynamical hahn ensemble .",
    "the dynamical correlation kernel is the so - called extended hahn kernel ; it has been previously obtained by johansson @xcite and johansson  nordenstam @xcite .",
    "the eynard - metha theorem @xcite provides the basis for computations of the kernel .",
    "the main result of our paper is computation of the asymptotics of the extended hahn kernel in the bulk limit regime .",
    "the answer is given by the translation - invariant kernel @xmath4 defined on @xmath5 , for which a simple integral representation was derived : @xmath6 here the integration is to be performed over the right side of the unit circle when @xmath7 and over the left side otherwise , parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 depend on the location in the bulk ( see theorem 1 ) .    the static version of the kernel ( @xmath10 ) is the well - known discrete sine kernel on @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the obtained dynamical extension of the sine kernel is among the kernels constructed in @xcite . the kernel @xmath4 is connected with the kernel obtained by okounkov and reshetihin in @xcite by a simple transformation ( duality of particles and holes on the lattice ) .    in the paper by kenyon @xcite local correlations in the model similar to the one considered by us in the similar limit regimes",
    "were studied . using different techniques",
    "it was shown that the limit distribution is one of the so - called ergodic gibbs measures @xmath12 on the infinite hexagonal graph .",
    "the latter measures were classified by sheffield in his thesis @xcite , and in the article @xcite correlation kernels for the measures @xmath12 were computed .",
    "kenyon points out that his results should hold in the general case but in his paper @xcite , full proof was given under the assumption that the so - called limit shape has no facets . in our case",
    "the limit shape does have facets , and it seems that our result does not follow from @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we do not employ the techniques of the papers by kenyon , okounkov and sheffield and obtain theorem 1 using a new method .",
    "subtle analytical results about asymptotic properties of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles can be found in literature ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , but they deal with static rather than dynamical ensembles .",
    "the usage of the well - known technique of investigating asymptotics via a suitable integral representation of the kernel in the case of the extended hahn kernel fails too .",
    "we solve the problem using the method first proposed in @xcite .",
    "although in @xcite again only static models were investigated , it turned out that the method can be adapted to the dynamical model of our interest .",
    "we use some relations between hahn polynomials with varying parameters for the computation of the pre - limit kernel ( similar approach was used in @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we define a stochastic process under study and compute its simplest characteristics . in section 2 , the determinantal form of the process is proved and its dynamical correlation kernel is expressed through the hahn orthogonal polynomials . in section 3 ,",
    "the main theorem is formulated and proved .",
    "finally , in the fourth section we analyze obtained results and show their connection with theorems proved in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the author would like to thank a.  borodin for proposing the problem , advices and hinting the required form of relations for the hahn polynomials .",
    "the author is grateful to g.  olshanski for many fruitful discussions and invaluable help in writing this article .",
    "consider the integer lattice @xmath13 on the plane @xmath14 and two sets of points on it : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ranges from @xmath18 to some fixed @xmath19 , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are some fixed parameters ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we are going to study collections of @xmath19 non - intersecting paths passing through the lattice nodes , such that the @xmath17-th path connects @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "every path is a polygonal line each link of which is a segment with left end - point @xmath25 and right end - point @xmath26 or @xmath27 . in other words ,",
    "the paths consist of horizontal segments and segments inclined at an angle of 45 degrees , thereby while moving along the path the @xmath28coordinate increases and the @xmath29coordinate does nt decrease .",
    "we will often call the @xmath28coordinate `` time '' .    introduce the probability space of all such families of paths and the probability measure on it considering all families equiprobable .",
    "now let us consider an arbitrary time moment @xmath28 and a set of points",
    "@xmath30 with coordinates @xmath31 respectively ( we assume that @xmath32 are arranged in the ascending order ) .",
    "the probability of the event that our collection of paths passes through the points @xmath33 is well defined .",
    "this probability induces a probability measure @xmath34 on the @xmath19point sets of positive integers in a natural way .",
    "next , the collections of paths under consideration define a stochastic process with discrete time @xmath35 , the state space consisting of @xmath19point sets of positive integers , and one - dimensional distributions @xmath36 .",
    "let us denote this process by @xmath37 .",
    "our aim is studying properties of this process .",
    "the above process is a markov process : this is readily seen from the very definition of the markov property ( the past and the future are independent given the present ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that all paths ( and consequently all configurations of the process @xmath37 ) are contained inside a hexagon whose two sides are parallel to the @xmath28axis , other two ones are parallel to the @xmath29axis and the remaining two sides are inclined at an angle of 45 degrees .",
    "the corresponding illustration is given in figure @xmath18    figure 1 .",
    "collection of 6 non - intersecting paths .",
    "we start with the explicit computation of the quantity @xmath38    the number of collections of the non - intersecting paths connecting points @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath17 varies from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , is equal to @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "this fact is well known .",
    "the trick which is used in the proof is described in @xcite .",
    "it follows from proposition 1 and definitions that @xmath42\\cdot \\det_{i , j=1,\\dots , n}\\left[{t - t\\choose s+i-1-z_j}\\right ] } { \\det_{i , j=1,\\dots , n}\\left[{t\\choose s+i - j}\\right]}.\\ ] ]    next we use theorem 26 from @xcite for the computation of the determinants . after some simplifications we obtain ( in what follows we use the standard notation @xmath43 ) :",

    "all explicit formulas connecting different parameters in different representations of the weight function will be given in the next section .",
    "thus , @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , is the weight of _ hahn orthogonal polynomials _ ( for the definition and properties of the hahn polynomials see @xcite ) while parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 depend on @xmath20 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath28 ; as before , @xmath47 is related to @xmath32 by a shift of the origin . in",
    "what follows @xmath54 denotes the weight function at the time moment @xmath28 .",

    "assume that @xmath56 are corresponding orthogonal polynomials . further consider the probability measure on the n - tuples of integers @xmath57 then the probability that the random @xmath19-tuple contains given distinct points @xmath58 is equal to @xmath59\\ ] ] where the kernel @xmath60 is computed using formula @xmath61    proof of this theorem can be found in @xcite    such a probability distribution on the @xmath19-tuples of integers is called _ the orthogonal polynomial ensemble_. observe that one - dimensional distributions in our problem have precisely the same type as those in the last proposition .",
    "now we return to the process @xmath37 under consideration .",
    "we are going to describe explicitly its one - dimensional distributions and the involved orthogonal polynomials and weight functions .    in our model",
    "the weight function can be written in the form @xmath62 ( here @xmath9 is some constant that does not depend on @xmath29 while @xmath63 differs from @xmath29 by some shift ) .",
    "note that the support of the weight function varies in time , i.e. , when @xmath28 increases by one either the support does nt change or one point is being added to it from above or one point is being removed from below or both actions happen simultaneously ( see figure 1 ) . denote the support of @xmath64 by @xmath65 .",

    "another similar formulation of the proposition was used in @xcite .",

    "( iv ) one should express @xmath115 in terms of @xmath119 and @xmath120 using ( * * ) and again use the last lemma .",

    "the fact that the one - dimensional distributions can be expressed in the form that is required for the application of proposition 5 follows from proposition 2 , where one takes @xmath121 ( actually , in this case proposition 2 is quite obvious ) and the following observation : @xmath122)^2=      \\det_{i , j=1,\\dots , n}\\left[f_{i-1}^t(x_j)\\right]\\cdot      \\det_{i , j=1,\\dots , n}\\left[f^t_{j-1}(x_i)\\right]\\\\=      \\det\\left(\\left[f^t_{i-1}(x_j)\\right]\\cdot \\left[f^t_{j-1}(x_i)\\right]\\right)=      \\det_{i , j=1,\\dots , n}\\left[k(x_j , x_i)\\right]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( here @xmath123 is the kernel defined in propostition 2 ) .",

    "the matrix under the sign of determinant has a zero row or column .",
    "consequently , the determinant is equal to zero . on the other hand , the transition probability is equal to zero , too .    in the former case",
    "the matrix under the sign of determinant is block - diagonal .",
    "moreover , its zeros are arranged in such a way that every block is either an upper triangular or lower triangular matrix .",
    "we may conclude that the determinant of the matrix is equal to the product of its diagonal elements , and the value of @xmath135 is equal to the transition probability of the process @xmath37 computed in lemma 4 .",
    "hence the process meets the conditions of proposition 3 and we conclude that the process is determinantal .",
    "we are interested in the limit distribution ( limit correlation kernel ) in the following limit regime :    let us fix numbers @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",

    "further we enlarge the hexagon by means of homothety with center at @xmath144 and coefficient equal to @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the number of the paths increases , and we are focusing on the local picture near the point @xmath144 .    recall the formula for the pre - limit kernel : @xmath146 the functions @xmath147 and the coefficients @xmath148 were defined in section 2 .",

    "existence of the process given by the limit correlation kernels follows easily from the convergence of these functions .",

    "finally , we perform the inverse fourier transform and derive the desired correlation kernel : @xmath241    the factor outside the integral can be omitted as it corresponds to a conjugation of the kernel which does nt change the correlation functions .",

    "@xmath242 reasoning is similar and we will omit some details . consider the operator @xmath243 which is given by the matrix @xmath244 it can be expressed in the following way : @xmath245 here @xmath246 is the operator defined on the first @xmath19 functions @xmath228 by the formula @xmath247 . as above",

    "this operator is equal to the operator of the restriction to the right arc of the unit circle contained between the angles @xmath207 and @xmath8 .    for further reasoning we need the following lemma :    consider two families @xmath255 and @xmath256 of the operators in the hilbert space .",
    "assume that when @xmath141 norms of all operators are bounded by some constant , @xmath257 and @xmath258 in the sense of the strong operator convergence , @xmath181 is an arbitrary orthoprojection and @xmath259 is its image .",

    "the restriction of this function to the unit circle is non - zero and invertible when @xmath272 while it may be equal to zero when @xmath273 . but the limit projection @xmath253 is the operator of multiplication by the characteristic function of some arc which does nt contain the point @xmath273 .",
    "consequently , restriction of the operator @xmath270 to the image of projection @xmath253 is invertible and we may apply the last lemma .    we obtain that ( in @xmath213realization ) limit of the operators @xmath249 multiplies vectors from the image of the limit projection @xmath253 by some function . this function is inverse to the function which the operator @xmath270 is multiplying by . on the other hand , @xmath274 for vectors from the orthogonal complement to the image of the projection @xmath253 , consequently , as norms of all operators @xmath250 are bounded , so @xmath275 .",
    "further reasoning is identical with the case @xmath214 .",
    "theorem is proved .",
    "now we will take a look more closely at the obtained one - dimensional correlation function which can also be called the density function .",
    "recall that all points of the collections of non - intersecting paths under consideration form a hexagon whose sides are parallel to one axis , other two ones are parallel to another axis and third pair of the sides is inclined 45 degrees with respect to the axis .    in the paper @xcite tilings of the hexagon by rhombi",
    "were studied .",
    "these tilings can also be interpreted as collections of non - intersecting paths .",
    "it was proved that so - called `` frozen''(or `` arctic '' ) regions exist . in these regions",
    "the limit distribution is non - random and tiling consists of rhombi of only one type ( for the exact wording see theorem 1.1 in @xcite )",
    ". we will show below that our results agree with this theorem and the shape or the frozen regions can be obtained also from our dynamical kernel as regions of such values of the parameters of the limit regime that local fluctuations disappear and the limit process is trivial ( either all points of the lattice belong to the random configuration with probability one or no points at all belong to the random configuration with probability one ) .",
    "let us fix the parameters of the hexagon @xmath138 , @xmath137 , @xmath136 in our model and study the dependence of the density function on the point @xmath144 .",
    "the limit distribution is non - trivial only inside an ellipse , which is tangent to the hexagon defined by the parameters @xmath138 , @xmath137 , @xmath136 while outside this ellipse the density function is equal to zero or to one .",
    "let us compute @xmath276 which coincides with the density function .",
    "we have : @xmath277 for some values of the parameters either @xmath155 or @xmath157 , it means that the density is equal to 0 or 1 . in our terms the desired case is equivalent to the fact that in the expression defining the angle @xmath8 ( @xmath278 ) the parameter @xmath279 is not less than 1 in magnitude . we can rewrite it as @xmath280 . after simplification",
    "last inequality transforms into @xmath281    interior of some ellipse is given by this expression .",
    "one can easily check that this ellipse is tangent to the borders of the hexagon under consideration defined by the parameters @xmath138 , @xmath137 , @xmath136 .    in the paper @xcite",
    "the frozen region was the same , it was the interior of the tangent ellipse .      in this section we will show the connection between our results and results of the paper @xcite . in the last paper",
    "some point process was studied .",
    "it had the correlation kernel equal to @xmath282 here @xmath283 is some complex number depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "this number is less than 1 in magnitude and has positive real component .",
    "the integration is to be performed over the right arc of the circle when @xmath284 , otherwise , over the left arc .",
    "one can choose a linear transformation of the lattice @xmath151 in such a way that processes given by our kernel and by the kernel from @xcite are connected by the particles - hole involution , i.e. random configurations given by the former kernel are complementary to the ones described by the latter kernel .",
    "observe that choosing five parameters of our model we can obtain arbitrary values of the kernel parameters @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "now take a look at the kernel from @xcite .",
    "let us change the variables in the integral to transform the path of integration into the arc of the unit circle ( note that arising factor outside the integral can be omitted as this factor does nt change correlation functions ) .",
    "next , we introduce the linear transformation of the lattice @xmath287 @xmath288 indeed this transformation maps the lattice considered by okounkov and reshetikhin into @xmath151 .",
    "the kernel becomes @xmath289 ( the integration is to be performed over the unit circle , the choice of arc is made in the same way as above , @xmath285 ) .",
    "for @xmath290 we make a change of variables in the integral @xmath291 : @xmath292 here the integration is performed over the right arc of the unit circle when @xmath293 and over the left one otherwise .",
    "the factor @xmath294 can be omitted again .",
    "this kernel differs from the kernel of our model by the sign for @xmath290 . while for @xmath10 the kernel differs from the desired one by the arc of the integration . to obtain the required arc we should subtract the integral from the residue of the integrand at the point 0 , i.e. subtract from 1 for @xmath295 and",
    "subtract from 0 for @xmath296 .",
    "thus , two kernels are related in the following way : @xmath297 .",
    "but it is exactly the transformation of the kernel in the particle - holes involution .",
    "( for instance , it was proved in appendix a.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that when the parameter of the integral @xmath298 in our model we can change the variables : @xmath299 .",
    "the constant @xmath9 becomes @xmath300 and also index of power of @xmath283 changes from @xmath301 into @xmath302 .",
    "however , this transform is only another linear transformation of the lattice .",
    "consequently , the proposition is proved in that case too .",
    "this result could have been foreseen , because the models are closely related . in @xcite the ensemble of 3d young diagrams without any restrictions",
    "was studied and one of the interpretation of our model is the ensemble of 3d young diagrams contained in the box . other argument in favor of this result is hypothetical universality of the obtained kernel stated in @xcite .",
    "one of the additional proofs of the universality was derivation of the same kernel in @xcite as bulk scaling limit of the cylindric partitions .",
    "the model under consideration has lots of different combinatorial interpretations .",
    "we will show some of them .",
    "now we incline at an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the horizontal axis segments of the polygonal lines which were inclined at an angle of 45 degrees . and replace the horizontal segments by the segments inclined at an angle of 30 degrees to the axis again , but this time downward directed .",
