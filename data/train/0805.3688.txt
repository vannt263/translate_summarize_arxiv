    "max - plus convex sets and cones have been studied by several authors with different motivations .",
    "they were introduced by k. zimmermann  @xcite when studying discrete optimization problems .",
    "another motivation arose from the use by maslov  @xcite of a max - plus analogue of the superposition principle , which applies to the solutions of a stationary hamilton - jacobi equation whose hamiltonian is convex in the adjoint variable .",
    "hence , the space of solutions has a structure analogous to that of a linear space .",
    "this was one of the motivations for the development of the idempotent analysis  @xcite which includes the study , by litvinov , maslov , and shpiz  @xcite of the idempotent spaces , of which max - plus cones are special cases .",

    "the tropical analogues of polytopes were considered by develin and sturmfels  @xcite , who established a remarkable connection with phylogenetic analysis , showing that tree metrics may be thought of in terms of tropical polytopes .",
    "tropical convexity was further studied by joswig  @xcite and develin and yu  @xcite .",

    "these motivations led to the proof of max - plus analogues of classical results such as : hahn - banach theorem either in analytic ( extension of linear forms ) or geometric ( separation ) form  @xcite , minkowski theorem ( generation of a closed convex set by its extreme points )  @xcite , and helly and carathodory type theorems  @xcite .",
    "however , some duality results are still missing , because the idempotency of addition creates difficulties which are absent in the classical theory .",

    "this kind of properties , relating internal and external representations of convex cones , are not yet well understood in the max - plus case .",
    "indeed , classical duality theory relates a convex cone with the set of linear inequalities that its points satisfy . in the max - plus setting , the _ polar _ of a max - plus convex cone @xmath13 can be defined as @xmath14 conversely , we may consider the set of points satisfying a given set of inequalities .",
    "this leads us to define , for all @xmath15 , a `` dual '' polar cone : @xmath16 it follows from the separation theorem of  @xcite that a closed max - plus convex cone @xmath4 is characterized by its polar cone : @xmath17 it is natural to ask which subsets @xmath18 of @xmath19 arise as polars of cones , or equivalently , which subsets are of the form @xmath20 for some @xmath21 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following analogue of the bipolar theorem :    [ bipolar ] a subset @xmath15 is the polar of a cone if , and only if , the following conditions are satisfied :    * @xmath18 is a closed max - plus convex cone , * @xmath22 , * @xmath23 .",
    "this follows from theorem  [ thbipolarrmax ] below .",
    "we deduce this result from a new separation theorem , theorem  [ tseppolrmax ] , which is in some sense a dual of the separation theorem of  @xcite .",
    "we shall first establish similar results when the scalars form a complete semiring which is reflexive in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "this applies in particular to the completion of the max - plus semiring @xmath24 .",
    "thanks to completeness and reflexivity properties , we shall obtain the separation theorem by algebraic and order theoretical arguments , relying on residuation theory ( galois connection in lattices ) .",

    "detailed explanations of the constructions of figure  [ polar ] can be found in example  [ examplepolar ] .",
    "we shall show that if @xmath18 is a finite subset of @xmath19 , representing a finite set of linear inequalities , then there are in general elements in the transitive closure of @xmath18 which are not linear combinations of @xmath18 .",
    "this means that there are some inequalities which can be logically deduced from the finite set of inequalities @xmath26 but which can not be obtained by a linear combination of these inequalities .",
    "hence , theorem  [ bipolar ] shows that there is no direct analogue of farkas lemma .",
    "this is related to the difficulties in defining the faces of tropical polyhedra , due to the obstructions mentioned in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "some properties concerning max - plus convex cones are analogous to the case of cones in classical convexity . however , max - plus convex cones also have some features which are reminiscent of classical linear spaces .",
    "this is because in max - plus algebra , an inequality @xmath27 can always be rewritten as an equality , @xmath28 .",
    "this point of view leads to define  @xcite the orthogonal of a max - plus convex cone @xmath4 , @xmath29 such an orthogonal is a congruence of semimodules , in the sense that will be defined in section  [ secseptheo ] . like in the case of linear inequalities",
    ", we may also consider the set of points satisfying a given set of linear equalities : for @xmath15 define @xmath30 as a consequence of the separation theorem of  @xcite we have @xmath31 if @xmath4 is a closed cone , a result which was already stated in  @xcite in the particular case of finitely generated cones .",
    "we shall prove , as a variant of our main theorem , the following biorthogonal theorem .",

    "congruences are used in  @xcite to solve some observability problems for max - plus linear discrete event systems , i.e.  to reconstruct some information on the state of the system from observations .",
    "the present biorthogonality theorem is used there to construct dynamic observers : in fact , cones are simpler to manipulate than congruences , due to the absence of `` doubling '' of the dimension , duality allows us to reduce algorithmic problems concerning congruences to algorithmic problems concerning cones .",
    "the duality results of the present paper may also be useful in the recent application of max - plus polyhedra to static analysis by abstract interpretation  @xcite .",
