    "fermilab uses slip - stacking in the recycler ( and previously main injector ) to double the proton bunch intensity it can deliver to experiments .",
    "the us particle physics community has come to a consensus that the fermilab should upgrade its proton beam intensity in a cost - effective manner  @xcite . to this end , the fermilab proton improvement plan - ii",
    "@xcite calls for an improvement in beam power from 700 kw ( with slip - stacking ) to 1.2 mw with an eye towards multi - mw improvements .",
    "the increase in proton intensity requires a commensurate decrease in the slip - stacking loss - rate to limit activation in the tunnel . a substantial improvement",
    "to either the booster beam quality or stable slip - stacking bucket area would accomplish this objective .",
    "this note describes the implications of both approaches .    slip - stacking allows two beams to accumulate in the same cyclic accelerator by using two rf cavities at near but distinct frequencies .",
    "slip - stacking has been used at fermilab since 2004 to nearly double the protons per ramp cycle  @xcite@xcite . slip - stacking in the main injector originally suffered significant beam - loading effects that were addressed through rf feedback and feedforward @xcite .",
    "previously slip - stacking took place in the main injector , but now takes place in the recycler to avoid loading time .",
    "the complete ramp cycle with slip - stacking in the recycler and a 15-hz booster cycle - rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ ss ] .",
    "the slipping rate of the buckets must be properly synchronized to the injection rate of new batches .",
    "the difference between the two rf frequencies must be equal to the product of the harmonic number of the booster rf and the cycle rate of the fermilab booster .",
    "so for a booster with a 15-hz cycle - rate we have @xmath0 and for a possible 20-hz cycle - rate @xmath1 the difference in the frequency of the two rf cavities is related to the difference in momentum of the two beams by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the harmonic number of the recycler and @xmath4 is the phase - slip factor of the recycler ( see table  [ param ] ) .",
    "consequently , the momentum difference between the two beams is @xmath5 for the 15-hz booster and @xmath6 for the 20-hz booster .",
    "the gains in slip - stacking efficiency under the 20-hz booster scenario also require an increase in rf cavity voltage ( see fig .",
    "[ ar](b ) ) .",
    "the ideal rf cavity voltage increases from 64 kv to 114 kv , which is a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "the duty factor may also decrease ( by no more than @xmath11 ) in the case of a 20-hz booster ; the power dissipation would increase by at least @xmath12 .",
    "the maximum recycler rf voltage is 150 kv and the maximum recycle rf power is 150 kw , according to @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the recycler rf cavities overheating would have to be investigated .",

    "<S> we examine the potential impacts to slip - stacking from a change of the booster cycle - rate from 15- to 20-hz . we find that changing the booster cycle - rate to 20-hz would greatly increase the slip - stacking bucket area , while potentially requiring greater usage of the recycler momentum aperture and additional power dissipation in the rf cavities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the losses from rf interference can be reduced by a factor of 4 - 10 ( depending on booster beam longitudinal parameters ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the aspect ratio and beam emittance requirements for efficient slip - stacking in both cycle - rate cases . using a different injection scheme </S>",
    "<S> can eliminate the need for greater momentum aperture in the recycler . </S>"
