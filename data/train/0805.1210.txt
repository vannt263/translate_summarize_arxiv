    "attractor neural networks ( ann ) are a paradigm for the property of associative memory @xcite . nevertheless , concerning practical applications , and also when trying to mold the essence of actual systems , the utility of ann is severely limited , mainly by the fact that they can only retrieve one memory at the time .",
    "in this note we show that such a limitation may be systematically overcome by simply generalizing familiar model situations .",
    "more specifically , we here extend some of our recent work on ann with fast pre  synaptic noise @xcite .",
    "the result is a novel mathematically ",
    "tractable ann whose activity eventually describes heteroclinic paths among the attractors .",
    "this illustrates , in particular , the possibility of a constructive role of chaos during searching processes .",
    "our previous related studies essentially considered the same model system but two different ways of updating it , namely , ( _ i _ ) sequential and ( _ ii _ ) parallel updating .",
    "interesting enough , the ensuing behavior was qualitatively , even dramatically different .",
    "that is , the main observation was , respectively , ( _ i _ ) a great enhancement of the system sensibility to external stimuli as a consequence of rapid synaptic fluctuations which simulate facilitation and/or depression cortesnc , depre5 , and ( _ ii _ ) chaotic behavior while the system spontaneously visited all the available attractors @xcite .",
    "each of these two regimes of behavior is to be associated with a different functionality of an essential dynamic instability .",
    "such an important dependence on the updating process is rather unexpected .",
    "for instance , we checked that it does not occur in a recent model @xcite which is based on a different depression mechanism .",
    "this situation motivated us to study in detail the changeover between ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) as a modification of our previously proposed ann cortesnc , depre4 .",
    "that is , we here present neural automata in which the number or density @xmath3 of neurons that are updated at each time step is a parameter . the resulting behavior as one modifies @xmath3 is varied and intriguing .",
    "it leads us to argue on the possible relevance of our observations to interpret neurobiological experiments .",
    "let the sets of neuron activities @xmath4 and synaptic weights @xmath5 where @xmath6 and assume a presynaptic current @xmath7 on each neuron due to the weighted action of the others . at each time unit ,",
    "one updates the activity of @xmath8 neurons , @xmath9 this induces evolution in discrete time , @xmath10 of the state probability distribution according to @xmath11where the transition rate is a superposition : @xmath12here , @xmath13 $ ] and we denote @xmath14 an extra set of indexes which helps one in selecting the desired subset of neurons .",
    "the above thus describes _ parallel _ updating , as in familiar cellular automata @xcite , _ _  _",
    "_ for @xmath15 or , macroscopically , @xmath16 while updating proceeds sequentially , as in kinetic ising - like models @xcite , for @xmath17 or @xmath18    we shall consider explicitly the simplest version of this model which happens to be both interesting and mathematically tractable .",
    "first , we assume binary neurons , so that @xmath19 which is known to be sufficient in order to capture the essentials of cooperative processes depre1,marrob , binaryneurons . the elementary rate @xmath20 is an arbitrary function of @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 an inverse temperature  or stochasticity parameter ) which we assume to satisfy detailed balance .",
    "this property is not fulfilled by the superposition ( [ rate ] ) for @xmath23 however .",
    "consequently , the resulting steady states are generally out of equilibrium , which is more realistic in practice than thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we shall only illustrate the case in which the @xmath8 neurons are chosen at random out from the set of @xmath24 so that one has @xmath25 in ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we also need to assume that the currents are such that @xmath26 , $ ] where @xmath27 are some given ,",
    "_ stored patterns _ ( realizations of the set of activities ) and @xmath28 here , @xmath29 measures the _ overlap _ between the current state and pattern @xmath30 for @xmath31 and finite @xmath32 i.e. , in the limit @xmath33 ( which is not the interesting case , but may serve first for illustrative purposes ) the resulting time equation under these conditions is @xmath34 where @xmath35 , $ ] for any @xmath30 the above result is general and valid for any type of patterns .",
    "it is to be noticed that the sum over @xmath36 in this map can be replaced by an average over the distribution of patterns @xmath37 this permits a simple derivation of mean - field dynamical equations for the overlaps , at least for finite @xmath38 note also that monte carlo simulations do not require restriction concerning the nature of the stored patterns .",
    "the above allows for different relations between the currents @xmath39 and the weights @xmath40 and between these and other system properties .",
    "the simplest realization corresponds to the hopfield case @xcite which follows from the map above for @xmath41 and currents given by @xmath42 with the weights fixed according to the hebb prescription , namely , @xmath43 the symmetry @xmath44 then assures @xmath45 and , for high enough @xmath46 the _ stored _ patterns @xmath47 are attractors of dynamics @xcite .",
    "we checked that , in agreement with some indications @xcite , the hopfield ",
    "hebb network exhibits associative memory for any @xmath48 however , the situation is more complex , e.g. , it depends on @xmath1 as one goes beyond hopfield ",
    "hebb , as we show in the next section .",
    "it is well documented that transmission of information and computations in the brain are correlated with activity  induced fast fluctuations of synapses , i.e. , our @xmath49 s @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it has been observed that there is some efficacy lost after heavy work , so that synapses suffer from _ depression _ ; it is claimed that repeated activation decreases the neurotransmitter release which depresses the synaptic response @xcite .",
    "the consequences of this have already been analyzed in various contexts depre1,mdepre3,bibit , cortesnc , depre4,depre5 , and a main general conclusion from these studies is that depression importantly affects a network performance reducing , in particular , the stability of the attractors .",
    "motivated by these facts , we shall adopt here the hopfield currents and the following prescription for the synaptic weights:@xmath50 n^{-1}\\sum\\nolimits_{\\mu } \\xi _ { i}^{\\mu } \\xi _ { j}^{\\mu } ,   \\label{wij}\\]]where @xmath51 note here that , in addition of static quenched disorder as in the standard hopfield model , the weights ( [ wij ] ) include a time dependence through the overlap vector @xmath52 which is a measure of the network firing activity .",
    "these weights , which reduce to the hebb prescription for @xmath53 amount to assume short  term fluctuations which change synapses by a factor @xmath54 on the average with a probability @xmath55 . therefore , any positive @xmath56 simulates synaptic depression if @xmath55 is large .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that , the greater @xmath57 is , more activity will in the average arrive to a particular postsynaptic neuron @xmath36 in the network and , therefore , this neuron will be more depressed .",
    "although the magnitude @xmath55 involves a sum over all stored patterns , this will only affect neurons that are active in a particular pattern for not too high correlated patterns .",
    "more details concerning these assertions are in @xcite .",
    "our setting here is rather close to the one in previous treatments of depressing synapses in a cooperative environment . as a matter of fact",
    ", one may show after some simple algebra that the model in @xcite corresponds to certain choices of @xmath54 and @xmath58 in ( [ wij ] ) concerning steady states .",
    "for instance , a possible choice for @xmath59 and @xmath60 is @xmath61 and @xmath62}{\\gamma^2(1-\\pi^2)+4\\gamma+4}$ ] where @xmath63 is the depression parameter defined in @xcite and @xmath64 is the value for that parameter at which @xmath65 this type of nonlinearity in @xmath66 however , induces less susceptibility than the choice we are using here ( see next section ) .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we shall be concerned in this paper with both positive and negative values of @xmath67 a result is that the behavior we are looking for ensues in any of these cases ( but only for certain values of @xmath68 ) .",
    "in the limite @xmath69 the ( nonequilibrium ) stationary state follows from the map for @xmath59 as @xmath70 and local stability requires that @xmath71 @xmath72 \\right\\ } \\allowbreak + \\left ( 1-\\rho \\right ) \\pi .$ ] the fixed point is therefore independent of @xmath1 but stability demands that @xmath73 with@xmath74 -\\beta + 1\\right\\ } ^{-1 }   \\label{roc}\\]](a condition that can not be fulfilled in the hopfield , @xmath75 case ) .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows , @xmath76 marks the period - doubling route to chaos in the saddle  point map .",
    "this behavior is confirmed numerically for @xmath77 stored arbitrary patterns , as shown numerically below .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows some typical _ stationary _ monte carlo runs , i.e. , from bottom to top : ( _ a _ ) convergence towards one attractor in fact , one of the _ antipatterns _ , namely , the negative of one of the given patterns for small @xmath78 ( _ b _ ) fully irregular behavior with positive lyapunov exponent for @xmath79 ( _ c _ ) regular oscillation between one attractor and its negative for @xmath80 ( _ d _ ) onset of chaos as @xmath3 is further increased ; and ( _ e _ ) rapid and ordered periodic oscillations between one pattern and its antipattern when , finally , all the neurons are active . the cases ( _ b _ ) and ( _ d _ ) are examples of instability  induced switching phenomena , in which the system activity chaotically _ visits _ different attractors by describing heteroclinic paths and remaining different time intervals in the neighborhood of each attractor . this kind of behavior was previously observed for @xmath81 at certain values of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the interesting new facts are that this requires a minimum of synchronized neurons , that this minimum as well as many other details depend on @xmath82 and that , as we show in the caption of figure [ fig1 ] , varying @xmath3 above @xmath83 seems to induce further intriguing qualitative changes .",
    "it is also to be remarked that chaotic switching or itinerancy requires that the system is in a specially susceptible state first described in cortesnc , depre5 .",
    "this is accomplished in the present case by means of the activity  dependent fast noise modelled in ( [ wij ] ) .",
    "one should expect that variations of this assumption on the weights may result in an equivalent susceptible state . as a matter of fact",
    ", we found that changing the sign of @xmath54 does not affect our main observations .",
    "however , the case @xmath53 in which the weights are fixed , does not exhibit interesting behavior , and @xmath3 turns then into an irrelevant parameter .",
    "on the other hand , the model in @xcite does not seem to involve sufficient susceptibility for the purpose ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) , in spite of the fact that it includes an activity  dependent depression mechanism .",
    "the explanation is the following . assuming that the dynamics can be writen as @xmath84 the gain function @xmath85 in the model in @xcite is a nonlinear one which behaves monotonically for all values of the depression parameter . in our case",
    ", however , a non - monotonic type of gain function occurs for some values of @xmath68 and @xmath86 ( see comparison in figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this has been reported to be important to originate a chaotic dynamics among the attractors @xcite .",
    "monitoring activity trajectories as one varies @xmath3 in the case of several stored patterns provides the following qualitative picture for arbitrary patterns . as far as @xmath87",
    "the activity remains wandering around one of the patterns .",
    "the pattern selected depends on the initial condition , and the trajectory visits a neighborhood of it whose volume increases slightly with @xmath88 the trajectory seems to tend to densely fill this volume with time .",
    "increasing @xmath89 however , the system may escape from the initially chosen pattern and , eventually , will tend to visit all the patterns .",
    "in addition , one observes that the trajectory is rather structured .",
    "that is , there are many jumps between the more correlated patterns but only very few to the less correlated ones if the system is close to the edge of chaos , and the system attention to all the patterns tends to be balanced as @xmath3 is increased within a chaotic window . increasing @xmath3",
    "further , the network surpasses equiprobability of patterns and , eventually , abandons the chaotic regime to fall into a limit cycle , where periodically oscillates between a pattern and its antipattern .",
    "this confirms and details the behavior shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this behavior , which is clearly observed in monte carlo simulations , can also be obtained under a mean field theory .",
    "assume , for instance , random patterns with @xmath90 where @xmath91 even for @xmath92 in the simplest case of two patterns this mean field dynamics is determined by @xmath93+\\rho\\;\\frac{1-a^2}{2}\\tanh [ b(\\pi_t ) ( \\pi^1_t\\!-\\!\\pi^2_t ) ] \\\\ \\\\ \\quad\\quad\\quad+\\,(1-\\rho)\\;\\pi^1_t \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\displaystyle \\pi^2_{t+1}=\\rho\\;\\frac{1+a^2}{2}\\tanh [ b(\\pi_t)(\\pi^1_t\\!+\\!\\pi^2_t)]-\\rho\\;\\frac{1-a^2}{2}\\tanh [ b(\\pi_t)(\\pi^1_t\\!-\\!\\pi^2_t ) ] \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\quad\\quad\\quad+\\,(1-\\rho)\\;\\pi^2_t , \\end{array } \\label{system2}\\ ] ] where @xmath94.$ ] it may be noticed that only in the non - interesting case of orthogonal patterns , namely @xmath95 the mean field dynamics ( [ system2 ] ) gives chaotic switching between a particular pattern and its antipattern but not between different patterns .",
    "otherwise , the situation is of chaotic switching among the stored patterns .",
    "this paper deals with ann in which the density @xmath3 of neurons that are updated at each time step is a parameter , so that the limit @xmath96 ( 1 ) corresponds to sequential ( parallel ) updating .",
    "our main motivation is that previous studies of ann in these limits revealed qualitatively different behavior , and that analysis in which the number of updated neurons is systematically varied are rare in the literature , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is worth to remark also that there are several arguments which suggest studying changes with @xmath88 one is simply the suspicion , born outside biology , that a network could perhaps like to maintain inert some of the nodes during operation , and not necessarily for economy but in order to gain efficiency . as a matter of fact ,",
    "as one may get convinced by oneself by looking at our expressions for the currents @xmath97 hushing some of the nodes may be equivalent to modifying the wiring topology , and this is recognized as a method to enhance a network efficiency @xcite .",
    "more specifically within biology , one may notice that assuming cells that are stimulated only in the presence of a neuromodulator such as dopamine , @xmath3 could stand for the fraction of neurons modulated each cycle .",
    "there is no input on the other @xmath98 so that information from the previous state is maintained , which was argued to be a basis for working memories micro , workmem . on the other hand",
    ", varying @xmath3 may also be relevant to simulate various situations of persistent activity @xcite , the observed variability of the neurons threshold @xcite , and the possible existence of _ silent neurons _",
    "@xcite , for instance .",
    "the fact is that varying @xmath3 in our model turns out to be very intriguing .",
    "however , @xmath3 is relevant only if the network is _",
    "susceptible_. such a condition occurs in our case as a consequence of activity  dependent _ fast synaptic _ noise as modelled in ( [ wij ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is irrelevant in other cases as , in particular , for the model in @xcite which is based on the depression mechanism introduced in @xcite , and also when the synaptic weights are fixed , even heterogeneously as in a hopfield  hebb network . on the contrary ,",
    "the model here exhibits kind of _ dynamic _ association , namely , the activity either goes to one attractor or else , for large enough @xmath89 visits possible attractors .",
    "the visits may abruptly become chaotic .",
    "besides synchronization of a minimum of neurons , this requires careful tuning of @xmath88 as a matter of fact , as shown by equation ( [ roc ] ) and figure fig1 , a complex situation makes it difficult to predict the result for slight changes of @xmath88 another interesting feature of our model is illustrated in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "this shows time series of the mean firing rate , @xmath99 in a case study with six patterns exposed to two different stimuli of the same intensity and duration ( between 3000 and 4000 @xmath8 monte carlo trials ) . each pattern is a string of @xmath100 bits .",
    "three patterns are randomly generated with 40 , 50 and 60% of the bits set to 1 , and the other three with the 1s at the first 70 , 50 and 25% positions , respectively ; the rest of the bits are set to @xmath101 the bottom graph shows the baseline activity without stimulus ( bs ) and the activity level under stimulus @xmath102 ( sa1 ) and @xmath103 ( sa2 ) , i.e. , two of the patterns . the behavior which exhibits the system in this case ( which we found for other parameter values as well ) is amazingly alike to observations in a comparable ( but true , not computer ) experimental setting concerning the odor response of the projection neurons in the locust antennal lobe @xcite .",
    "interesting enough , the switching which shows our model due to stimulus destabilization in the simulation of figure [ fig5 ] occurs for @xmath104 in fact , a similar phenomenon was observed also for @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this shows that , at least in this case , an efficient adaptation to a changing environment does not require chaos .",
    "however , the chaotic itinerancy we described above allows for a more efficient search of the attractors space in a way that was believed to hold in relevant systems under a critical condition @xcite .",
    "our model thus illustrates a mechanism that makes chaos extremely beneficial .",
    "this confirms expectations @xcite that the instability inherent to chaos facilitates moving to any pattern at any time .",
    "the present model system illustrates a specific mechanism which allows for this . as @xmath3 increases in a chaotic region",
    ", it is more likely that the activity will visit all the attractors , not only the most correlated ones .",
    "the number and diversity of attractors it visits then increases with @xmath1 and we observed that the time spent in the attractor also varies with @xmath88 the system in this way may perform family discrimination and classification by tuning @xmath88 we finally remark that our model allows for describing a coupling of @xmath3 to the activity , which may be quite a realistic setting in some cases . no doubt it would be interesting to study other related model situations .",
