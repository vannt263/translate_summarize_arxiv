    "the discovery of a new member of a small class of astrophysical sources is important because each source has the potential to constrain theoretical models of the source physics .",
    "neutron star binary systems are an example of a small class of x  ray sources , with numbers presently totaling total @xmath12 .",
    "powered pulsars can be divided into two broad classes based on their x  ray luminosities and spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x  ray spectra of the higher luminosity sources ( @xmath13 ergs s@xmath11 ) are typically characterized by a hard power law of photon index @xmath14 out to an energy of @xmath15 kev , above which the spectrum `` breaks '' to a much steeper index ( @xmath16 ) . the lower luminosity accreting x ",
    "ray pulsars tend not to have this broken power law shape , and instead have a softer spectral shape ( @xmath17 ) over a broad range of x  ray energies .",
    "furthermore , observations of low luminosity burst sources have revealed weak power law components ( @xmath18 ) when the inferred accretion accretion rate drops below a critical value ( @xcite ) . in this _ letter _",
    "we present the detection of a new source which appears to be a low luminosity accreting x  ray source .",
    "the @xmath19 ( fwhm ) field of view centered at the point ra ( j2000 ) @xmath20 and dec ( j2000 ) @xmath21 was observed by the high energy x  ray timing experiment ( hexte ) and the proportional counter array ( pca ) instruments aboard the _ rossi x  ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) satellite on a number of occasions between august 16 - 19 , 1996 , with a total livetime of @xmath22 ksec .",
    "the target of the observations was the interplanetary network ( ipn ) error box from the soft gamma ",
    "ray repeater sgr 1900 + 14 ( @xcite ) , and the pointing was offset to avoid the bright confusing source 4u1907 + 097 , which is @xmath23 away .",
    "the hexte instrument consists of two clusters of collimated nai / csi phoswich detectors with a total net area of @xmath24 @xmath25 and an effective energy range of @xmath26 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "hexte background estimation utilizes near - real time observations of off - source viewing directions .",
    "the pca instrument consists of @xmath27 collimated xenon proportional counter detectors with a total net area of @xmath28 @xmath29 and an effective energy range of @xmath30 kev ( @xcite ) . for the pca instrument ,",
    "the instrumental background estimate is determined from modeling blank sky observations to estimate both the internal background of the detectors and the background due to cosmic x - ray flux .",
    "photon event times from the pca in the energy range @xmath3 kev were extracted and binned into lightcurves of @xmath31 second binsize , after correcting the times to the solar system barycenter using the jpl de200 ephemeris and _ rxte _ pointing coordinates .",
    "the process was repeated for background data generated with the pca background model , which was then subtracted from the on - source lightcurve . a lomb - scargle periodogram ( @xcite )",
    "was then formed from the data , resulting in the power spectrum shown in figure 1 ( top ) .",
    "two harmonically spaced frequencies were detected at frequencies @xmath32 hz and @xmath33 hz . the probability that each of these peaks is a random fluctuation is @xmath34 , given the number of frequencies examined and the exponential probability distribution of the lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the presence of peaks corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 is also suggested by the periodogram , but at a marginal significance .",
    "periodogram and fft analysis using different time binsizes , no background subtraction , individual pca detector units , and time interval subsets all show evidence for of one or two harmonic peaks in the power spectra .    the harmonically - spaced frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 imply a fundamental frequency of @xmath39 , corresponding to a period of @xmath40 seconds . to search for the fundamental period we performed a chi - squared folding analysis on @xmath41 frequencies corresponding to periods about @xmath42 seconds , with a frequency resolution equal to the independent fourier spacing implied by the total duration of the data .",
    "the result , shown in figure 1 ( bottom ) , indicates a fundamental period of @xmath43 seconds .",
    "we then searched the hexte event data for this periodicity , using the @xmath44 test ( @xcite ) .",
    "hexte on - source event times in the energy range @xmath45 kev were accumulated and corrected to the solar system barycenter using the the jpl de200 ephemeris and _ rxte _ pointing coordinates ( as before ) .",
    "the @xmath46 event times yielded a @xmath47 value of @xmath48 , using the single frequency corresponding to the period @xmath49 seconds .",
    "this corresponds to a random probability of @xmath50 , given the probability distribution of @xmath44 . as a check ,",
    "the @xmath45 kev hexte _ off - source _ events were analyzed in an identical manner and a value of @xmath51 was obtained  consistent with no periodicity .",
    "the barycenter - corrected pca and hexte event times were extracted for various energy ranges and folded on the fundamental period @xmath52 seconds ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the corrected event times were normalized to mjd 50342.0 ( tdb ) before folding .",
    "the folded lightcurve ( flc ) appears to change at energies between @xmath53 kev , with the pulse profile becoming more singly - peaked and possibly shifting in phase .",
    "in addition , the pulsed emission for energies above @xmath54 kev peaks at a different phase than the emission at lower energies . given the contributions from instrumental , cosmic x ",
    "ray , and galactic ridge fluxes implied by the spectral fits ( discussed below ) , we derive pulsed fractions of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 in the energy ranges @xmath3 , @xmath15 and @xmath58 kev , respectively .",
    "we have searched for evidence of doppler shifts associated with possible binary motion in the observed periodicities from xte j1906 + 09 .",
    "barycenter corrected @xmath30 kev pca event times were collected for @xmath59 observation intervals throughout the observing period .",
    "the frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath38 were determined for each time interval via fitting of the peak in the @xmath47 distribution , taken from small frequency ranges about @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with a gaussian .",
    "the fundamental frequency @xmath62 ( corresponding to the @xmath49 s period ) was then obtained for each data set by the relation @xmath63 .",
    "we find that the fundamental frequency obtained in this manner is consistent with a constant frequency over the @xmath64 day observation period . because of the limited ( @xmath59 ) number of observations and limited temporal coverage of the observations , however , the non - detection of significant doppler shifts poses no serious constraint on the possible binary orbital parameters of the system . for secular period changes ,",
    "we fit a model to the data in which the period changes linearly with time , and obtained a @xmath65 upper limit of @xmath66 .",
    "spectral analysis of relatively faint x ",
    "ray sources at low galactic latitudes is complicated by the presence of diffuse emission from the galactic ridge .",
    "recent work by valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) indicates that the pointing direction of xte j1906 + 09 is outside the bright , thin component of the ridge emission but inside the broader ( fwhm@xmath67 ) region .",
    "only one of the hexte background positions is centered on a region of significantly higher galactic x  ray flux @xmath68 , and this background is excluded from the analysis . following valinia & marshall ( 1998 ) ,",
    "we model the galactic ridge emission in the pca with thermal and nonthermal components consisting of raymond - smith plasma ( with solar elemental abundances and zero redshift ) and power law spectral shapes , respectively , multiplied by a neutral hydrogen absorption factor .",
    "the phase - averaged pca and hexte data were fit simultaneously to various continuum spectral models using xspec 10.0 and assuming that xte j1906 + 09 was at the center of the field of view .",
    "for the spectral fits , pca and hexte data in the energy ranges @xmath69 and @xmath70 kev , respectively , were used . to account for uncertainties in the effective open area of the two instruments ,",
    "the relative normalization of hexte was treated as a free parameter in the spectral fits .",
    "the plasma temperature , spectral index , and @xmath71 values of the galactic ridge spectrum ( pca only ) were held fixed at values appropriate for the `` central ridge '' ( see table 3 from valinia & marshall 1998 ) , but the normalizations were allowed to vary , to account for the fact that the _ rxte _ pointing position is displaced from the galactic plane by @xmath19 .",
    "the results for a power law model for the xte j1906 + 09 emission is given in table 1 .",
    "a thermal bremsstrahlung spectral shape of temperature @xmath6 kev and @xmath72 @xmath8 fits the data equally well .",
    "more complicated spectral models ( such as broken power laws ) were not fit to the data , due to insufficient counts above @xmath4 kev .",
    "the reduced chi - squared values for both the power law and thermal bremsstrahlung spectral fits were @xmath73 for @xmath74 degrees of freedom .",
    "as expected , for both fits the galactic ridge normalization values were lower than the values given in valinia & marshall ( 1998 )  consistent with the @xmath19 offset from the galactic plane  and the relative normalization factor between the pca and hexte was consistent with previous fits to high galactic latitude sources ( @xcite ) . in the spectral fitting , we have assumed that all the observed iron line emission is from the galactic ridge ( raymond - smith plasma component ) , and therefore we do not attempt to constrain the iron line emission from xte j1906 + 09 .",
    "because of the low galactic latitude of the observed field , there is no shortage of possible xte j1906 + 09 counterparts .",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey ( @xcite ) sources rx j190724 + 0843.4 and rx j190717 + 0919.3 ( @xcite ) are unlikely counterparts , because their count rates are significantly higher ( by at least an order of magnitude ) than the predicted _ rosat _ pspc count rate of xte j1906 + 09 , given the spectral parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "the predicted _ rosat _ hri count rates are @xmath75 and @xmath76 counts s@xmath11 for the power law and thermal bremsstrahlung spectral forms , respectively .",
    "supernova remnants such a g42.8 + 0.6 and other supernova remnants in the field of view ( @xcite ) are usually not associated with slow ( period @xmath9 s ) pulsars because of age constraints .",
    "the pulsation period and inferred luminosity of xte j1906 + 09 indicate that that the x  ray emission is powered by accretion onto a neutron star . the high absorption column density implied by the spectral fit suggests that the source is located at a distance of at least @xmath77 kpc , and this yields a lower limit to the x  ray luminosity ( @xmath3 kev ) of @xmath10 ergs s@xmath11 . a variable pulse shape with energy ( fig .",
    "2 ) is characteristic of accretion - powered neutron star systems , in which the emergent x  ray emission pattern is determined by the geometry and the distribution of matter in the vicinity .",
    "the scattering cross section is also energy dependent , and hence the pulse profile is expected to vary with energy . in addition , at lower energies more complicated pulsar lightcurves are expected due to photoelectric absorption by material around the neutron star .    assuming that xte j1906 + 09 is an accretion - powered binary system , we can speculate on the nature of the system . the low luminosity and long spin period of xte j1906 + 09 are atypical of low mass x ",
    "ray binary systems , but are consistent with a high mass system in which the accretion takes place via mass ejection from the companion star . such high mass x ",
    "ray binaries can be divided into two classes : underfilled roche lobe systems and be - binary systems .",
    "be - binary systems are transient systems in which the outflow from the be star companion takes the form of either a stellar wind or an equatorial mass ejection ( @xcite ) .",
    "these sources are transient or highly variable , with x  ray luminosities ranging over @xmath78 orders of magnitude ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "if xte j1906 + 09 is such a system , it probably has a long orbit ( @xmath80 days ) , due to the observed correlation between orbit and pulsar periods in be - binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "one problem with this identification is that the x  ray spectra of these systems are characterized by power laws with photon indices @xmath81 ( @xmath82 kev , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath83 kev spectrum of xte j1906 + 09 ( using the hexte data only ) is fit by a power law of photon index @xmath84 , which is significantly harder than this .",
    "in addition , there are no known be stars in the @xmath19 xte j1906 + 09 error box ( @xcite ) .",
    "xte j1906 + 09 could also be an underfilled roche lobe supergiant system .",
    "these systems typically have long orbital periods ( @xmath85 days ) , long spin periods ( @xmath86 s ) , and relatively low x  ray luminosities of @xmath87 ergs s@xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred parameters of xte j1906 + 09 are consistent with being a member of this class , but the x  ray spectral index of xte j1906 + 09 is flatter than that seen from roche lobe supergiant systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "the peculiar double m star infrared system discovered by hartmann et al . ( 1995 ) is also in the _ rxte _ field of view .",
    "the stars in this system are heavily reddened ( @xmath88 ) , implying a distance of @xmath89 kpc , and are thought to be gravitationally bound with an orbit of @xmath90 years ( @xcite ) . using the average extinction curve given in savage & mathis ( 1979 ) , and the relation between @xmath71 and @xmath91 given in korneef ( 1982 ) , we derive the relation @xmath92 mag , where @xmath93 is @xmath71 in units of @xmath94 @xmath8 . from the mean xte j1906 + 09 @xmath71 value obtained from the power law and bremsstrahlung",
    "fits , we obtain @xmath95 mag , which is consistent with the value seen from these stars .    given the similarities between the observed properties of xte j1906 + 09 and high mass wind - fed x ",
    "ray binary systems , and the similar inferred distances of xte j1906 + 09 and the m star supergiant system , we regard the latter as a promising counterpart candidate to xte j1906 + 09 .",
    "the large separation of the m stars would allow one to have a neutron star companion without significant effect on the m star system",
    ". then the m star - neutron star system could be the source of the x  ray flux seen by _",
    "rxte_. vrba et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have suggested that such a combination might be the counterpart of the soft gamma ",
    "ray repeater sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "the detection of @xmath42 second pulsations from these ir sources would verify the association of xte j1906 + 09 with this system , and xte j1906 + 09 would become the first known x - ray triple system .",
    "we have presented the detection of a new @xmath42 second pulsating x  ray source with _",
    "rxte_. the source was detected during observations of a region of galactic plane containing the sgr 1900 + 14 error box .",
    "characteristics of the folded lightcurves and spectrum suggest that the source , xte j1906 + 09 , is a low luminosity x  ray binary located beyond the galactic center .",
    "the low luminosity and long pulse period of xte j1906 + 09 indicate that this source is probably a high mass x  ray binary accreting via a stellar wind .",
    "we raise the possibility that the new source is associated with the highly absorbed double m supergiant binary system on the edge of the sgr 1900 + 14 error box .",
