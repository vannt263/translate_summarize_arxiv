    "within the loop - based approach to quantum gravity , there are now a number of proposals for the hamiltonian constraint @xcite . most of these are modifications of thiemann s proposal @xcite , and in particular make use of an observation by rovelli and smolin @xcite that certain limits of operators can be taken on diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "one would like to test any proposal for the quantum constraints of gravity in a variety of ways .",
    "below , we consider the proposals for euclidean quantum gravity , computing the constraint algebras for each and comparing them to the classical hypersurface deformation algebra of @xcite .",
    "although the constraint algebra has been studied at a more heuristic level and in a less well - defined context @xcite , an actual computation has until now been impossible for the proposals of @xcite due to the subtle way in which these works construct their constraints .",
    "the proposals follow the ideas of @xcite and define the constraints only when acting on a space @xmath1 of ` diffeomorphism invariant ' states .",
    "this is because they employ a limiting procedure which does not converge on a general state .",
    "however , because a typical hamiltonian constraint has nonvanishing commutator with the diffeomorphism constraint , the action of such a constraint takes a diffeomorphism invariant state to a state that is _ not _ diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "the ranges of the proposed constraint operators are therefore not contained in their domains and it is not possible to apply two of them in succession , or to directly compute a commutator .",
    "it is important to note that what we have in mind differs from the `` anomaly - free '' calculation of @xcite in that we wish to commute the so - called ` unregulated ' or ` regulator independent ' operators , whereas @xcite studied the commutator of regulator dependent constraints .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the limiting procedures of @xcite in fact converge on a larger space @xmath2 , which we shall call the space of ` vertex - smooth states . '",
    "thus , the proposed operators extend naturally to @xmath0 . furthermore , @xmath0 is mapped into itself by all of the proposed constraints . as a result ,",
    "the proposals define constraint operators _ within _ the space @xmath0 , and products and commutators of such operators are well defined in this space .",
    "let us recall that , classically , the poisson bracket of two euclidean hamiltonian constraints is an inverse metric @xmath3 times an infinitesimal diffeomorphism generator @xmath4 : [ alg1 ] \\{h(n),h(m ) } = ( mn_a - nm_a ) c_b q^ab .",
    "we will see that a generic element of @xmath0 is not annihilated by the diffeomorphism generator , a fact first pointed out to the authors by jos mouro .",
    "] indeed , the action of the diffeomorphism group on @xmath0 provides a faithful representation .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 contains the entire space of solutions to the constraints discussed in @xcite  presumably , the entire space of physical states in these proposals . it would therefore be a great surprise if the inverse metric was degenerate on this space .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the commutator of two hamiltonian constraints vanishes identically on @xmath0 for a large class of proposals .",
    "more will be said about quantum versions of @xmath5 in the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "there is in fact a general difficulty in constructing a quantum version of [ alg1 ] using operators that act on ( and preserve ) some subspace of a hilbert space which contains diffeomorphism invariant states . with a few natural assumptions , we shown in the appendix that , in such a case , every diffeomorphism invariant state in domain of the hamiltonian operators must be annihilated by the hamiltonians .",
    "it is interesting to note that our argument breaks down if the constraints are rescaled and made into minus - half - densities  a case never considered in canonical gravity to our knowledge .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section ii first establishes the context and conventions for our work and then describes the new space @xmath0 .",
    "section iii then describes a general class of ` rst - like ' operators on @xmath0 which includes many of the ( so - called ` non - symmetric ' ) proposals for the euclidean hamiltonian constraints .",
    "it also shows that the commutator of such operators vanishes in general . in section iv",
    ", we discuss various ` symmetrized ' operators that have been proposed . here",
    ", the commutator again tends to vanish and , when it does not , it also fails to annihilate diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "this accounts for all existing proposals except that of @xcite , which will be considered in @xcite .",
    "we end with a brief discussion in section v.",
    "this section introduces the new space @xmath0 of ` vertex - smooth states ' which will allow us to compute constraint algebras .",
    "section iia sets the framework for our discussion and establishes notation and conventions .",
    "section iib then describes the vertex - smooth states .",
    "we save the demonstration that @xmath0 provides a natural habitat for rst - like constraints for a later section , after the constraints themselves have been introduced .",
    "we now take a few moments to fix our context and conventions before introducing the new space .",
    "we recall that standard constructions @xcite of the space of generalized connections make use of an analytic structure on the three manifold @xmath6 .",
    "they were generalized by baez and sawin @xcite to the smooth category , however the notion of the spin - network has not been completely successfully defined in that case . on the one hand ,",
    "the definition of hamiltonian constraints given in @xcite requires the action of smooth , rather then analytic diffeomorphisms but , on the other hand , the construction of the diffeomorphism invariant states of @xcite makes use of the spin - networks .",
    "merging these two features requires some care .",
    "the hilbert space we desire is constructed without invoking an analytic structure but it is only a subspace of that of @xcite ; in fact , it is the subspace studied in @xcite .    in @xcite , a space of ` generalized connections '",
    "was constructed using the @xmath7 algebra defined by the traces of holonomies of a connection along piecewise smooth closed curves in @xmath6 .",
    "the spectrum of this algebra is the ashtekar - isham space @xmath8 .",
    "the elements of this space can be thought of as ` distributional ' connections for which the holonomy around any closed curve is well - defined , but for which such holonomies satisfy no continuity properties @xcite .",
    "this is to be the ` quantum configuration space , ' and quantum states are to be functions on this space .",
    "following @xcite we consider a special set of such functions associated with graphs embedded in @xmath6 . by a graph @xmath9",
    "we mean a finite set of ` edges ' ( 1-dimensional , smooth oriented submanifolds of @xmath6 with a 2-point boundary called ` the ends ' of an edge ) such that any two of them intersect , if at all , at only one or both ends .",
    "we denote the set of edges of @xmath9 by @xmath10 , and the particular subset with at least one end at @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "also associated with a graph @xmath9 is a set of vertices @xmath13 ; the vertices @xmath13 are the end points of the edges .",
    "we will say that a function on @xmath8 is ` cylindrical over a graph @xmath9 ' if it depends only on the holonomies of the generalized connection along curves that lie in that particular graph . as the graphs we consider are smoothly embedded , every cylindrical function over a graph belongs to the hilbert space described by baez and sawin @xcite .",
    "as a result , there is an inner product on these smooth cylindrical functions , and they can be completed to form a hilbert space @xmath14 which is a proper subspace of the hilbert space of @xcite .",
    "the construction of @xcite is more general and allows curves to intersect an infinite number of times , but such cases were not considered in @xcite so we will also exclude them here ( see @xcite for an extension of the theory to such cases ) .",
    "the natural action of smooth diffeomorphisms of @xmath6 in @xmath14 is unitary . for @xmath15",
    ", the action will be denoted @xmath16 , with @xmath17 .    to each graph",
    "@xmath18 one associates a certain subspace @xmath19 in such a manner that @xmath20 is orthogonal to @xmath21 whenever the ranges of the graphs differ from each other , @xmath22 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath14 has the property that  =  _ r()h_where @xmath23 denotes the direct sum of hilbert spaces and implies that that the result should be completed to obtain another hilbert space .    given a graph @xmath18 , the space @xmath24 can be formed from the associated to @xmath18 ` spin - network functions ' @xcite recall that spin networks @xmath25 are smooth cylindrical functions which are parameterized by triples @xmath26 where @xmath9 ranges over all graphs embedded in @xmath6 and @xmath27 range over certain lists of ` spins ' and ` contractors ' associated with the graph @xmath9 .",
    "the label @xmath28 assigns a representation of @xmath29 to each edge of @xmath9 , while a contractor @xmath30 assigns an ` intertwinor ' to each vertex @xmath11 in @xmath9 which ensures that @xmath25 is invariant with respect to the gauge transformations .",
    "the intertwinors are linear operators which act in a space determined by the spins assigned by @xmath28 to the edges that intersect at @xmath11 ; the reader should consult @xcite for details .",
    "now , @xmath24 is the hilbert completion of the space spanned by all the spin - network functions given by all the labels @xmath26 such that for every edge @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "it is convenient to use the symbol @xmath33 to denote the vertex set of the underlying graph @xmath9 , and to refer to the vertices of @xmath9 as vertices of the spin network @xmath25 . also , given a graph @xmath9 or a spin - network @xmath25 , by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively we denote the range of the graph .",
    "if the list of possible contractors is properly chosen , then the states @xmath36 form an orthonormal basis of @xmath14 .",
    "let us choose once and for all a particular such orthonormal basis @xmath37 .",
    "an important point is that , for @xmath38 , the set of allowed contractors @xmath30 is finite for a fixed pair @xmath39 .",
    "this means that any spin network is a finite linear combination of states in @xmath37 .",
    "it follows that the space @xmath40 of finite linear combinations of spin networks is also the space of finite linear combinations of states in @xmath37 . in order to remove the regulators",
    ", @xcite required the constraints to act on ` diffeomorphism - invariant ' states .",
    "while no state in @xmath14 is invariant under all diffeomorphisms , a space of diffeomorphism invariant states was constructed in @xcite .",
    "this was done by working in a larger space which consists of linear functionals on some dense subspace of @xmath14 .",
    "we will take this dense subspace to be @xmath40 and consider the space of all linear functionals on @xmath40 , the dual @xmath41 of @xmath40 .",
    "because the elements of @xmath41 are linear functions on @xmath40 , they will be denoted by ` bra ' vectors @xmath42 .",
    "note that if one chooses the topology on @xmath40 to be just that due to its linear structure , the algebraic and topological duals of @xmath40 coincide .",
    "our spaces satisfy the relation  and are analogous to a rigged hilbert triple .",
    "since smooth diffeomorphisms of @xmath6 act on @xmath40 , they have a natural ( dual ) action on @xmath41 .",
    "the space @xmath41 is quite large , and in particular contains many linear functionals which are invariant under the action of all such diffeomorphisms .",
    "we use @xmath43 to denote the space of such diffeomorphism invariant functionals .",
    "it is on this space that the _ un_regulated constraints @xmath44 of @xcite were defined in those works . in order to reduce the already formidable amount of notation present in this paper , we will not explicitly differentiate between the action of an operator on a space @xmath40 and the dual action of the operator on the space of linear functionals on @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , we will explicitly display the regulators for regulated constraints so that @xmath44 , with no regulator , will always denote an operator that acts in the dual space . ] .",
    "however , because a given constraint @xmath44 depends on a choice of lapse function @xmath45 , the constraints themselves are not diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "thus , the action of @xmath44 in general yields a state that is _ not _ diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "products such as @xmath46 are therefore not , a priori , defined .",
    "if one wishes to compute commutators , one needs a space larger than @xmath43 in which to work .    because the constraints of gravity enforce diffeomorphism invariance , @xmath43 may be expected to contain any ` physical ' states ( in the sense of dirac@xcite ) .",
    "however , in the current work we are interested in the constraint algebra , which must vanish on physical states .",
    "in fact , the classical commutator @xcite of two hamiltonian constraints becomes trivial when just the diffeomorphism constraint is satisfied , so we again see that @xmath43 is too small for our purposes .",
    "we now introduce a larger space @xmath0 of ` vertex - smooth ' states with @xmath47 .",
    "we seek a space which carries a well - defined action of the constraints of @xcite and which is preserved by that action .",
    "the fact @xcite that the constraints are ` anomaly - free ' ( in the sense defined in @xcite ) on diffeomorphism invariant states may be taken as a hint that such a space should exist .",
    "furthermore , we would like the natural action of the diffeomorphism group to give a faithful representation on this new space .",
    "that is to say , only the identity diffeomorphism should be represented trivially .",
    "readers who are already familiar with the constraints introduced in @xcite will recall that those constraints were defined only on diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "specifically it was important that the action of the ( dual ) state @xmath48 on a spin network over a graph @xmath9 does not depend on the exact placement of the edges of @xmath9 .",
    "this is true for any diffeomorphism invariant state , as its action remains the same when an edge is moved by a small diffeomorphism .",
    "the key point concerning our new space is that its states , too , will not care about the exact placement of edges , yet they will care about the placement of _ vertices _ as a result , the space @xmath49 will carry a faithful representation of the diffeomorphism group . the careful reader may object that moving an edge generally involves moving vertices as well , but this will be dealt with in section iii .",
    "our definition is as follows .",
    "let @xmath50 contain those @xmath51 such that :    * \\a ) if two spin networks @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related by a smooth diffeomorphism which is the identity on their vertices , then | _ 1 = | _ 2 .",
    "+ thus , if we fix some ` reference ' spin network @xmath54 with @xmath55 vertices @xmath56 , then , as @xmath57 ranges over @xmath58 , @xmath59 of vertices of @xmath60 .",
    "that is to say that @xmath61 on the space of maps @xmath62 given by restricting diffeomorphisms @xmath57 to @xmath33 .",
    "* \\b ) each function @xmath63 as above extends to a _",
    "smooth_. however , requiring @xmath64 to be differentiable allows infinitesimal diffeomorphisms to act on @xmath0 , and taking @xmath64 to be smooth allows @xmath0 to be preserved under this action . ]",
    "function @xmath65 on the _ entire _ space @xmath66 of maps @xmath67 from @xmath33 to @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , @xmath68 must be smooth at points where two or more vertices are mapped to the same point in @xmath6 , despite the fact that @xmath69 was only defined on maps @xmath70 that take distinct vertices to distinct points .    as a result",
    ", a state @xmath71 can be characterized by a family of smooth functions @xmath72 , one for each equivalence class of spin networks under smooth diffeomorphisms .",
    "the diffeomorphism invariant elements of @xmath41 are just those states @xmath73 for which each @xmath74 is a constant function .",
    "thus , @xmath75 .",
    "we will see below that the euclidean constraints of @xcite are well - defined on this space and that they map this space into itself , allowing us to compute their algebra .",
    "in this section we discuss a general class of operator families which we call the the ` rovelli - smolin - thiemann - like ' operators or the ` rst - like ' operators .",
    "such a family is labeled by a lapse function @xmath76 , as are the hamiltonian constraints of gravity .",
    "this class will include the ( so - called ` nonsymmetric ' ) constraints introduced in @xcite .",
    "we show below that all such operators are defined on @xmath0 and map @xmath0 into itself .",
    "we will also show that any two operators @xmath44 and @xmath77 in the same family commute .",
    "rst - like operators are based on the notion of a ` loop assignment scheme ' @xmath78 , which takes a vertex @xmath11 of a graph @xmath9 and an ordered pair @xmath79 of edges in @xmath9 and assigns to @xmath80 a smooth loop @xmath81 \\rightarrow \\sigma$ ] .",
    "below , we use the symbol @xmath82 to denote either the map from @xmath83 $ ] to @xmath6 or its orientation preserving reparametrization invariance class ; the meaning should be clear from the context .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we require a loop assignment scheme to have the following properties .",
    "1 ) each loop @xmath82 must begin and end at @xmath11 and be such that @xmath84 is a subset of the range @xmath85 some other graph @xmath86 ; for example , this excludes loops with infinitely many self - intersections .",
    "2 ) the loop @xmath82 is also required to span a nontrivial area and to be tangent to the plane defined by @xmath79 at its beginning and its end .",
    "3 ) finally , a loop assignment scheme must be ` locally diffeomorphism covariant , ' in the sense that if @xmath80 restricted to a neighborhood @xmath87 of @xmath11 is related to @xmath88 restricted to a neighborhood @xmath89 of @xmath90 by a smooth diffeomorphism @xmath57 , then @xmath91 where @xmath92 is some ( possibly different ) smooth diffeomorphism which coincides with @xmath57 on the restriction of @xmath93 to @xmath87 . here",
    ", the symbol @xmath94 denotes the composition of functions .",
    "the loop assignment scheme will play the role of a ` regulator ' for the quantum operator with the idea that , as the regulator is removed , one should pass through a series of loop assignment schemes in which the loops shrink to points .",
    "this limit will be discussed in more detail shortly .",
    "having chosen a loop assignment scheme @xmath78 , a _ regulated _ rst - like operator is constructed from a family of operators [ ht ] ^(x ) : associated with the points @xmath95 .",
    "the action of @xmath96 on a spin network @xmath97 vanishes when @xmath98 is not a vertex of @xmath18 , and otherwise can be written in the form [ rstlike ] ^(x)|,j , c  =  _ i , j e(,v ) u^i[(,x , i , j ) ]    @xmath99 of edges of @xmath9 incident at @xmath11 and there is a vector of linear operators h_i(,j , x , i , j):c  h_i(,j , x , i , j)c , on the space of contractors for @xmath100 associated to every pair of edges @xmath79 intersecting at the point @xmath98 . the repeated index @xmath101 is summed over @xmath102 and @xmath103 $ ] is the traceless part of the holonomy @xmath104 $ ] defined by u [ ] = u^0[]+ u^i[]_i , where @xmath105 are the generators of @xmath29 .",
    "the operator @xmath106 transforms according to the the adjoint representation of @xmath29 under gauge transformations at @xmath98 , is antisymmetric in @xmath79 , and carries a gauge invariant intertwinor @xmath30 into a vector of intertwinors @xmath107 by changing only the linear operators assigned by @xmath30 to the particular vertex @xmath98 .",
    "these operators must again satisfy a ` local diffeomorphism covariance ' condition in the sense that if @xmath108 restricted to @xmath87 is related to @xmath109 restricted to @xmath89 by a diffeomorphism @xmath15 with @xmath110 for open sets @xmath111 , @xmath112 , then @xmath113 and @xmath114 are related by the same diffeomorphism ; specifically , _ (",

    "the ( uncountably infinite ) sum is well defined when acting on an element @xmath116 of @xmath40 as all but a finite number of terms annihilate any given such @xmath117 .",
    "it is clear from @xcite that the regulated ` non - symmetric ' constraints proposed in that work are of the form ( [ rstlike ] ) and define regulated rst - like operators .",
    "the same is true of the constraints discussed in @xcite ( which are related to those of @xcite by ` changing the factor ordering ' ) . for these particular proposals ,",
    "the loop assigned to any vertex @xmath11 and edge pair @xmath79 first runs along @xmath118 , then crosses over to @xmath119 without intersecting any other edges , and returns to @xmath11 along @xmath119 .",
    "the details of @xmath113 for the proposal of @xcite depend on the choice of volume operator and on the particular interpretation of the regularization scheme .",
    "having defined the regulated operators , the regulator @xmath78 is now to be ` removed ' by considering sequences @xmath120 in which , as @xmath121 , the loops @xmath122 shrink to the vertex @xmath11 , and such that loops @xmath122 which correspond to the same graph , vertex , and edges but to different values of @xmath123 are related by diffeomorphisms which map the graph @xmath9 to itself .",
    "that is to say that @xmath124 should satisfy @xmath125 for some @xmath126 such that @xmath127 preserves the edges of @xmath9 ( and their orientations ) and @xmath128 for all @xmath129",
    ". the sequence should also be such that , given @xmath80 and an open set @xmath130 , there is some @xmath131 for which , for all @xmath132 , we have @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the identity outside of @xmath87 .",
    "the ` unregulated ' constraint operator is to be defined through [ op ] ( n)|= _ n ^_n(n ) | .",
    "we may schematically denote this limit by @xmath135 , though the final object @xmath136 will depend on the particular sequence of loop assignment schemes chosen .",
    "such an object @xmath44 will be called an ( unregulated ) rst - like operator .",
    "note that , when acting on @xmath14 , this limit does not converge at all : typically , for a spin network @xmath137 , @xmath138 is orthogonal to @xmath139 for @xmath140 because the two states are supported on graphs occupying different positions in @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that ( as remarked in @xcite ) if cylindrical functions are viewed as functions on _ continuous _",
    "( i.e. , nondistributional ) connections , then the limit ( [ op ] ) does converge when acting on such functions , but the result is just the zero operator .",
    "this follows from the fact that , as the loops shrink to a point , the holonomies @xmath141 $ ] become @xmath142 so that @xmath143 $ ] goes to zero .",
    "nonetheless , a well - defined non - zero limit will be obtained by considering the dual operator induced by @xmath144 in the space @xmath0 of linear functionals defined above .    to show this ,",
    "let us consider @xmath145 and take @xmath146 to be a spin network . for each @xmath123 , the functions @xmath147|\\gamma , j , h^i(\\gamma , j , x , i , j ) c\\rangle$ ]",

    "the important point is that only a finite number of spin network states can appear in this decomposition .",
    "this is because the allowed spin is bounded by the sum of the maximum spin in the list @xmath28 and ( @xmath151 times ) the maximum number of times the loop @xmath122 retraces itself . as a result , we may write [ expand ] _",

    "thus , @xmath169 is a well - defined element of @xmath41 .",
    "note that in fact , for @xmath163 , @xmath170 is a vertex of the graph @xmath25 ; this reminds us of the implicit dependence of @xmath127 on @xmath33 . due to the local diffeomorphism covariance of the loop assignments , ( [ lim ] )",

    "it is clear that the space @xmath0 could in fact be extended even further .",
    "just as it was sufficient for our states to depend smoothly on the positions of the vertices , it is not necessary for the states to be completely independent of the placement of the edges .",

    "however , the space @xmath0 defined in section [ vss ] is enough for our purposes and we will not discuss further generalizations here .",
    "we are now in a position to study the commutator @xmath185 $ ] as an operator on @xmath0 .",
    "although we work on a larger space @xmath0 and with the unregulated operators ( which are of a more general form than in @xcite ) , the following argument is much like the anomaly - free calculation of @xcite .",

    "the general case can then be reconstructed using the fact that @xmath44 is linear in @xmath45 .",

    "we again stress that this holds for any rst - like operator , whether it acts on planar vertices or not .",

    "we note that a particular choice was made in @xcite , but we will instead leave the relevant parameters arbitrary . for a generic loop assignment ( such that the attached loop @xmath233 never overlaps @xmath18 ) , @xmath229 is a densely defined operator in @xmath232 . for other loop assignments , @xmath136 may only be defined on some smaller domain ( say , @xmath234 ) as states in @xmath235 are carried out of @xmath232 by @xmath229 . in any case , one can see if @xmath229 is symmetric in the sense of a bilinear form on its domain . because @xmath229 typically ` destroys ' edges of graphs and usually does not ` create ' edges , @xmath229 is not symmetric in any of the hilbert spaces @xmath232 unless the inner product is chosen so degenerate that @xmath229 is just the zero operator in @xmath232 . in this sense then , no family of rst - like constraints is symmetric .    the view has been expressed @xcite that one might like to have a family of hamiltonian constraints that _ are _ symmetric in some sense . a minimal requirement might be that @xmath229 defines a symmetric operator on some natural domain in @xmath232 . the status of this view is not completely clear , as there are general arguments @xcite that , due to the structure of the classical constraint algebra , the hamiltonian constraints should not be self - adjoint . since , however , the classical commutator of hamiltonian constraints vanishes on the surface in phase space satisfying the diffeomorphism constraints , this argument need not apply to @xmath229 on @xmath232 .",
    "see also the commentary of @xcite on this issue .",
    "we therefore wish to consider a ` symmetrization ' of our family of constraints which gives a self - adjoint @xmath229 on some @xmath232 and compute the algebra of the resulting constraints .",

    "the set of proposals @xcite for ` symmetrizing ' the constraints is in fact quite diverse . in this subsection",

    "however , we then show ( in section iv c ) that even this new definition of symmetrization leads to either commuting constraints or to constraints which are anomalous in the sense that their commutator does not even vanish on diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "it is in this sense that we use the terms ` anomaly ' or ` anomalous ' in the rest of this work .    at first",

    "this possibility was mentioned in @xcite and was used as a basis for @xcite .",

    "recall that @xmath245 basically adds edges ( due to the @xmath246 $ ] factor ) to @xmath243 .",
    "thus , @xmath247 typically vanishes unless @xmath248 is a subgraph of @xmath9 and @xmath249 supplies exactly the missing edges ( for some @xmath250 ) . however , the required edges of @xmath9 lie at a finite separation from the vertices of @xmath248 , while the edges added by @xmath251 $ ] approach @xmath11 as @xmath162 .",
    "since there are only a finite number of subgraphs of @xmath248 and one may use the fact that the @xmath252 s for various @xmath123 are related by diffeomorphisms to bound the change in spin , for fixed @xmath238 there is only a finite set of @xmath243 for which @xmath253 can be nonzero , independent of the value of @xmath123 . as a result , for @xmath123 greater than some @xmath254 , @xmath255 for all @xmath243 .",

    "due to the fact that we have not required the loops to shrink in a uniform ( @xmath9 independent ) way , the limit of @xmath259^\\dagger$ ] may be nonzero , or may not even by defined on all of @xmath43 .",

    "another proposal was made by de pietri , rovelli , and borrisov in @xcite and corresponds to ` changing the factor ordering ' of the regulated constraints of @xcite .",
    "however , in our notation their proposal amounts to simply using a different set of operators @xmath261 than the original proposal of thiemann .",
    "in fact , under their proposal , the fully ` symmetrized ' operator is still an rst - like operator .",
    "thus , such operators are not constant - lapse symmetric in the above sense .",
    "in addition , the calculation of section [ comsec ] applies and the commutator of two such constraints vanishes on @xmath0 .    finally , we remark that another kind of symmetrization was considered in @xcite , and involved ` marking ' various edges .",

    "see we are interested in the unregulated constraints , we will not discuss this proposal here .",
    "it appears that the sort of ` symmetrization ' which is desired @xcite is something that does not involve marking special edges and which is somehow closer to the symmetrization of @xmath229 induced by the inner product on @xmath232 .",
    "a step in this direction was suggested to us by thiemann @xcite and will be described below together with the resulting definition of the hermitian conjugates @xmath262 .",
    "the idea is to rewrite the definition of the hermitian conjugate of @xmath229 induced by the inner product on @xmath232 in a suggestive form , which can then be refined to define a family of operators @xmath225 which we will refer to as the ` hermitian conjugates ' of @xmath226 .",
    "it is important to note that our definition of the hermitian conjugate will make use of special properties of @xmath226 , and will not be applicable to a general family of operators @xmath263 on @xmath0 labeled by lapse functions . in particular , it does not directly provide a definition of the hermitian conjugate of @xmath225 , or of the ` symmetrized ' operator @xmath264 . as a result",
    ", this structure in no ways runs counter to the arguments of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the family @xmath265 will be constant lapse symmetric , as desired .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the inner product defined by @xcite on diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "in fact , @xcite considered a space of spin network states based on analytic graphs and invariance only under analytic diffeomorphisms .",
    "what we need here is an extension to our smooth case .",
    "the construction is similar to that of @xcite , and in fact simpler @xcite .",
    "for example there is no issue of ` type i ' vs. ` type ii ' graphs ( see @xcite ) ; in our smooth case , all graphs may be studied together . since the treatment of our case is direct ( given the methods of @xcite )",
    ", we simply state the results below ; the reader may consult @xcite for details .",
    "we will first need a bit of notation . recall that an important notion in @xcite was the group @xmath266 of ` graph symmetries ' of a graph @xmath9 .",
    "roughly speaking , this is the group of all embeddings of @xmath18 into itself .",
    "we define it as follows : consider the ` isotropy ' group @xmath267 of diffeomorphisms @xmath57 that map @xmath9 to itself . also , let @xmath268 ( the ` trivial action ' subgroup ) consist of those @xmath269 that map every _ edge _ of the graph @xmath9 to itself and preserve every edge s orientation .",
    "the trivial action subgroup is normal in @xmath270 , and the graph symmetry group is defined to be the quotient : @xmath271 . given a graph @xmath18 , the symmetry group @xmath272 acts naturally in the linear space spanned by the spin - networks over @xmath18 .",
    "now , for a spin network @xmath25 over a graph @xmath18 , we will define a linear functional @xmath273 .",
    "suppose that @xmath237 is a spin network over a graph @xmath86 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath9 ( so that @xmath274 for some @xmath275 .",
    "then , the action of @xmath276 on @xmath237 is with respect to the action of the group of diffeomorphisms ' @xcite . ] , 1 |   : =   _ s ( ) ( _ s ) ( ) |. when @xmath86 is not diffeomorphic to @xmath18 , the result is just zero .",
    "if we let @xmath277 be the space spanned by ( finite ) linear combinations of the @xmath278 , then a natural family of inner products @xcite on @xmath277 is given by [ dip ] , 1 |  , 1  = a _ [ ] , 1 |  for any set of positive real constants @xmath279}$ ] which may depend on the diffeomorphism class of @xmath18 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath232 is just the completion of @xmath231 in one of the inner products ( [ dip ] ) .    as a result",
    ", the hermitian conjugate of @xmath229 is defined on an appropriate domain by latexmath:[$\\langle \\gamma , 1|\\hat{h}^\\dagger(1 )     where the overline denotes complex conjugation .",
    "this led thiemann to suggest @xcite that a ` hermitian conjugate family ' @xmath225 be defined on diffeomorphism invariant states of the form @xmath276 by some sort of expression of the form : [ symondiff ] , 1 | h^(n ) |  = for an appropriate diffeomorphism @xmath281 that , in some sense , moves @xmath25 to the location in @xmath6 occupied by @xmath243 .",
    "our task it to make this suggestion precise , and in fact we will simultaneously extend it so that @xmath225 can act on states which are not necessarily diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "nevertheless , we take ( [ symondiff ] ) as our moral inspiration and link to the inner product ( [ dip ] ) .    to proceed , we will first need to introduce some new notation .",
    "for example , for every graph @xmath18 we define the pointed symmetry group @xmath282 by replacing , at every stage in the the definition of @xmath272 , the groups @xmath283 and @xmath284 with their subgroups @xmath285 and @xmath286 of diffeomorphisms which are the identity on the vertices of @xmath18 .",
    "next , given any spin network @xmath25 and any map @xmath287 , we define the state @xmath288 to be the linear functional for which _ |",
    "  =   _ s _ * ( ) ^ _ s ( ) |  for @xmath237 such that there is a diffeomorphism @xmath289 satisfying @xmath290 and which , when restricted to the vertices of @xmath9 , coincides with @xmath70 . for other @xmath237",
    ", we set @xmath291 . note that if @xmath70 happens to map two distinct vertices of @xmath25 to the same point , then @xmath288 is just the zero functional .",
    "the states @xmath288 do not lie in @xmath0 , because their action does not depend smoothly on the location of the vertices of @xmath243 ; it vanishes unless the vertices of @xmath243 occupy exactly the positions assigned by the map @xmath70 .",
    "however , these states can be used to build a large class of states in @xmath0 which we will label @xmath292 with @xmath25 a spin network and @xmath293 a smooth function .",
    "these are the states defined by [ fdef ] , f |  : = _ ^v ( ) f ( ) _ | recall that such ( uncountably infinite ) sums are well defined in @xmath41 as , when acting on a given spin network state , only a finite number of the terms contribute .",
    "for example , given spin networks @xmath25 and @xmath243 associated to graphs @xmath18 and @xmath86 respectively , if there is some @xmath294 such that @xmath295 then we have [ action ] , f |",

    "we define a linear functional on @xmath40 corresponding to the notion of @xmath298 ` averaged with respect to the diffeomorphisms acting trivially on @xmath299 ' ,   |^x  : =  _ _ |_x = id , | .",
    "the functional @xmath300 is again not an element of @xmath0 but the action of @xmath301 is naturally defined on such states by ( [ lim ] ) .    for any rst - like operator @xmath226",

    "when @xmath243 has at least as many vertices as @xmath25 , we set [ hc ] , f |",
    "h^(n ) |  =   _ ^v()f ( ) _ x v_|v()|( ) ( ) , where @xmath302 is any diffeomorphism of @xmath6 that coincides with @xmath70 on @xmath33 and @xmath303 is the set of all @xmath123-element subsets of @xmath304 ( so that @xmath305 is the set of all sets of vertices of @xmath243 which have the same number of elements as the set of the vertices of @xmath25 ) .",
    "when @xmath243 has less vertices than @xmath25 , we set @xmath306 .",
    "the result is a well - defined family of operators @xmath307 .",
    "implicit in our definition is the fact that a ( regulated ) rst - like operator always adds vertices when acting on a spin network @xmath238 .",
    "thus , the action of an ( unregulated ) rst - like operator on the ( dual ) state @xmath292 is of the form @xmath308 where each @xmath243 has _ less",
    "_ vertices than @xmath25 . as a result",
    ", we may expect that @xmath309 where now each @xmath243 has _ more _ vertices than @xmath25 .",
    "it is this idea which motivates the definition of @xmath310 given above .",
    "there are several properties of ( [ hc ] ) that we would like to point out . for example , the reader may readily verify that the hermitian conjugate family of operators ( [ hc ] ) is consistent with the hilbert space inner product on @xmath311 : when the domains are properly chosen , the restriction of @xmath312 to @xmath311 for @xmath313 is the hermitian conjugate of the associated restriction of @xmath314 with respect to the hilbert product of @xmath311 .",
    "in addition , one sees that when @xmath243 has at least as many vertices as @xmath25 , the only nonzero contribution in ( [ hc ] ) comes from terms in which @xmath315 .",
    "thus ( [ hc ] ) depends on the values of the lapse @xmath45 only at the vertices of @xmath243 . in this sense",
    "@xmath302 moves @xmath25 to the position occupied by @xmath243 .",
    "the details of ( [ hc ] ) are complicated due to the desire to deal carefully with graphs with symmetries ; we recall that the action ( [ action ] ) of @xmath292 also has several terms when @xmath266 is not empty . in this sense",
    "then , ( [ hc ] ) can be seen as a precise implementation of the ideas of ( [ symondiff ] ) .",
    "it would also appear that ( [ hc ] ) is a precise implementation of the ideas of @xcite .",
    "finally we note that , as expected , @xmath262 generally ` adds edges ' : when the spins of @xmath25 are large enough , latexmath:[$\\langle \\gamma , f | h^\\dagger(n ) = \\sum_{\\gamma ' } \\langle \\gamma ' , f^{\\gamma ' }    each @xmath248 . the reader may also wish to investigate other properties of this expression for himself .",
    "now , a priori , the action of @xmath262 is only defined on the vector space ( which we shall call @xmath317 ) spanned by the states @xmath318 .",
    "this space is in fact sufficient for our study of the commutator , but we may also attempt to extend the definition of @xmath262 to all of @xmath0 using a kind of ` super linearity . '",
    "the point is that a general state @xmath159 can be written as a certain sum of states of the form @xmath292 . indeed , for a state @xmath319 such that the graph symmetry group of the underlying graph @xmath9 is trivial",
    ", the function @xmath320 is just the function @xmath74 from the definition of @xmath0 in section [ vss ] , while @xmath321 for all @xmath243 not diffeomorphic to @xmath25 is zero .",
    "thus , a general state @xmath159 can be written as [ basis ] | = _ s^ * , _",

    "| h^(n ) | .",
    "such a sum will make sense if , for each state @xmath238 , only a finite number of terms contribute .",
    "this is the case if one uses a loop assignment such that none of the loops @xmath233 overlaps @xmath18 .",
    "however , for the assignment used in @xcite , we must distinguish two cases in the work of thiemann . due to the phenomenon of ` disappearing edges'@xcite , @xmath262 as defined by the original constraints @xmath226 of @xcite does not satisfy the above requirement .",
    "that is , for certain choices of @xmath238 , an ( uncountably ) infinite number of terms in the sum ( [ slin ] ) may be nonzero .",
    "thus , we say that the action of @xmath312 on a general element of @xmath0 is divergent . unfortunately , this is true even if we attempt to extend the definition only to the image @xmath327 $ ] of @xmath328 under @xmath77 .",
    "( again , because of the disappearing edges phenomenon , the smaller space @xmath329 is not preserved by @xmath312 ) .",
    "thus , it is not possible to define @xmath330 even on @xmath331 , or to compute a commutator on this space .",
    "furthermore , there is no subspace on which @xmath226 and @xmath225 are both defined and which is preserved by both of these operators .",
    "similarly , for this case , @xmath332 is only defined on a subspace @xmath333 of @xmath232 which is not dense in @xmath232 . however , there are subspaces @xmath334 of @xmath41 on which the @xmath123-fold action of @xmath226 or @xmath225 are defined .",
    "thus , we might calculate the commutator on @xmath335 .",
    "more will be said about this shortly .",
    "the other case considered by thiemann @xcite is when certain additional ` projection ' operators are introduced to remove the offending terms generated by @xmath226 . as a result",
    ", we must now consider the class of ` projected rst - like operators ' defined in the same way as the rst - like operators , but from regulated operators of the form [ prstlike ] ^(x)|,j , c  =  p__i , j e(,v ) u^i[(,x , i , j ) ] |,j , h_i(,j , x , i , j)c . here",
    ", all is as with the rst - like operators , except for the addition of the projection @xmath336 .",
    "this @xmath336 is just the projection onto the space of all spin networks @xmath337 over graphs @xmath248 such that the graph @xmath9 is a subgraph of @xmath248 .",
    "these projections clearly satisfy their own version of ` diffeomorphism covariance ' and , as a result , the arguments of sections [ takelim ] and [ comsec ] can be repeated for the projected rst - like operators , showing that they yield well defined operators @xmath338 and that any two such constraints commute .",
    "as before , we do not comment on the motivations behind this construction , but simply use it to calculate the commutator of the symmetrized constraints .    with the projectors in place , the associated hermitian conjugate operators @xmath262 defined by ( [ hc ] ) are well - defined on all of @xmath0 .",
    "we also note that for a state @xmath51 in @xmath335 , the action of a projected operator on @xmath51 is _ identical _ to the action of the corresponding unprojected operator on @xmath51 . as a result ,",
    "our discussion of the projected case below includes much of the information about the unprojected commutator in fact , an argument similar to the one given below also holds for the unprojected operator on @xmath335 ( and produces similar results ) , so long as appropriate care is taken with the convergence of various ` superlinear ' expressions .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the particular constraints proposed by thiemann , and use the projected form ( [ prstlike ] ) .",
    "as stated above , an argument similar to the one below also applies to thiemann s unprojected operators on @xmath335 , so long as appropriate care is taken with superlinear expressions .",
    "in addition , we consider only forms of thiemann s constraint which do not act at planar vertices  it is straightforward to show than any other case is anomalous in the sense that @xmath340 $ ] does not annihilate diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "we will not review the details of thiemann s proposal here , but we remind the reader of what for us is the most important property of this proposal : that for a spin network @xmath137 , the graphs @xmath341 associated with the spin networks @xmath342 appearing in ( [ expand ] ) differ from @xmath9 only in having a single extra edge attached to two edges that intersect at @xmath11 as shown below : .2 cm .2 cm    fig .",

    "addition _ of such an edge .",
    "there are in fact several types of terms to consider in calculating the commutator and it is useful to dispense with some of them right at the beginning .",
    "suppose that we define the ` symmetrized ' hamiltonian @xmath345 .",
    "the commutator of two such operators can be expanded in four terms : @xmath346 & = & [ \\hat h(n ) , \\hat h(m ) ] \\cr & + & [ \\hat h^\\dagger(n ) , \\hat{h}(m ) ] + [ \\hat h(n ) , h^\\dagger(m ) ] + [ \\hat h^\\dagger(n ) , \\hat h^\\dagger(m)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we have already shown that the first term is zero , we shall concentrate on the last three .",
    "in fact , it is the treatment of the middle two that will be most complicated .",
    "it is quite easy to outline the proof that these terms also vanish . given a state @xmath347 and a probe spin - network function @xmath348 the quantity @xmath349| \\gamma ' \\rangle $ ] is the sum of contributions coming , roughly speaking , from the action of the two operators either at a same vertex @xmath11 , say , of @xmath243 or at disjoint vertices @xmath11 , @xmath350 , say . for the first kind of contribution , the only dependence on the lapse functions is an overall factor @xmath351 which is obviously symmetric with respect to the change @xmath352 . for the second",
    ", the action at each of the vertices depends only on the characteristics of the spin - network @xmath243 in an appropriate neighborhood of that vertex . in most cases the neighborhoods are disjoint so that the order in which the operators act is irrelevant .",
    "the only special case is when an edge added by the operator at @xmath353 can be annihilated at @xmath354 @xcite . on such spin - networks ,",
    "the commutator is not zero .",
    "thus , in computing the commutator of the constraints , our general approach will be quite similar to ( but dual to ) that of section [ comsec ] .",
    "that is , we will attempt to decompose the action of @xmath226 and @xmath225 on @xmath292 as a sum over actions that we may describe as ` localized at the various vertices of @xmath25 ' and then use local diffeomorphism invariance ( and properties of thiemann s proposal ) to compute the commutator . however , before attacking the problem directly , it will be useful to recall some general facts about spin networks and cylindrical functions on @xmath355 .",
    "we recall that the space @xmath355 can in fact be constructed as a quotient space . in the notation of @xcite ( see also a later work @xcite ) , @xmath356 .",

    "the answer was found to be ` rather little . '",
    "it would appear that three interpretations are possible :    the first would be to note that the constraint algebra is not actually a ` physical ' object since the constraints should simply annihilate any physical states .",
    "thus , a consistent interpretation is to state that point of view to state that any meaningful comparison of a quantum theory with general relativity must take the form of examining the classical limit of gauge invariant quantities and physical states .",
    "since our analysis does not achieve this , it is not truly meaningful .    as a first response ,",
    "let us consider a theory of gravity coupled to matter .",
    "then the classical phase space functions corresponding to the operators studied here no longer annihilate physical states and neither does their commutator . instead , while that commutator is not an observable , it does generate ` diffeomorphisms of the gravitational degrees of freedom relative to the matter degrees of freedom ' even on physical states . however , if our results carry over to such a setting and if the physical states lie in a space corresponding to the one studied here , then the analogous quantum commutator is still the zero operator .",
    "it is true that even this would not address the action of a physical operator on a physical state .",
    "nonetheless , it appears close enough that our work may be taken as a caution that , when confronted with a a proposed quantum object arising from a complicated regularization procedure , it is important to find a nontrivial check that this object does in fact have some relation to the desired physics .    the next interpretation would be to suggest that the space @xmath0 is somehow too small to see a nontrivial commutator ; that the commutator just ` happens to vanish ' on @xmath0 . in argument against this interpretation",
    "we note that @xmath0 is quite large and contains both the spaces @xmath40 and @xmath43 , which were supposed to capture much of the physics of general relativity@xcite",
    ". however , this question merits a more thorough discussion of the ` right - hand side ' of the classical commutator .",
    "recall that the classical poisson bracket of two hamiltonian constraints is \\{h(n),h(m ) } = n_a c_b q^ab , where @xmath3 is the inverse three - metric and @xmath4 is the vector constraint .",
    "the question is then of how @xmath5 should be represented on @xmath40 or @xmath0 and whether or not it should , in general , vanish .. one study of this operator was performed in @xcite and it will be addressed further in @xcite , but here we content ourselves with two observations .",
    "we recall that @xmath4 generates diffeomorphisms and that the generator of diffeomorphisms is well - defined and nonvanishing on @xmath0 .",
    "also , @xmath3 is invertible classically , so we would be surprised if it vanished on a large set of quantum states .",
    "the third interpretation is that the quantum constraint proposals studied here fail to capture the physics of general relativity .",
    "taking that point of view the question remains , however , of whether one can single out a particular aspect of these proposals as being responsible for the difficulties .",
    "the use of diffeomorphism invariant ( or partially diffeomorphism invariant ) states in defining the limit in which the regulators are removed seems a likely culprit .",
    "this question will be examined in more detail in @xcite , which will study certain variations on that theme .",
    "it is , however , important to note that even if these constraints by themselves fail to capture the physics of gravity , this does not necessarily mean that they are _ incompatible _ with that physics and can not be used as a starting point .",
    "an important example in this regard is the work of thiemann @xcite on 2 + 1 gravity .",
    "we expect that all of the results given here in the 3 + 1 context also hold for the 2 + 1 constraints used there .",
    "nevertheless , thiemann showed that the solutions space of these constraints contains ( as a small subspace ) the usual physical states of the witten formulation @xcite of 2 + 1 gravity .",
    "he was then able to pick out these states by using various elements of the witten formulation .",
    "something similar may be possible in the 3 + 1 case as well , though the question remains of what additional structure would then play the role of the 2 + 1 witten formulation .",
    "it would appear that our work is related to the commentary of smolin in @xcite .",
    "his work notes that constraints defined by the rst - like limiting procedure ( and their hermitian conjugates ) are ` too local ' at an intuitive level and do not seem to generate structures that resemble the features of general relativity .",
    "it then suggests a number of difficulties which may be expected to follow , but unfortunately it is difficult to make these arguments conclusive . while the algebra was not a specific concern of @xcite , at least for the rst - like operators themselves ( if not for the ` symmetrized ' versions of section [ sym ] )",
    ", it is the intuitive ` locality ' which is responsible for the vanishing of the commutator .",
    "thus , although our analysis does not deal directly with observables , one could regard our work in section [ rst ] as a precise statement of the type desired in @xcite .",
    "one might hope @xcite to achieve better results by abandoning the canonical framework completely and defining the quantum theory via some sort of path integral .",
    "while this may be possible , we take the results derived here as a general warning that , until some well - defined and nontrivial calculation can be done to connect the quantum theory with general relativity , it remains unclear to what extent the proposed quantization captures the desired physics .",
    "we would like to thank abhay ashtekar , rudolfo gambini , jos mouro , jorge pullin , carlo rovelli , and especially thomas thiemann both for their perspective and for clarifying the status of the field .",
    "we also thank thomas thiemann for a critical reading of an early draft of the paper .",
    "this was work supported in part by funds from the erwin schrdinger institute , the max planck society , the grants phy95 - 07065 and phy-9722362 from the us national science foundation , syracuse university .",
    "jl thanks alexander von humboldt - stiftung ( avh ) , the polish committee on scientific research ( kbn , grant no . 2 p03b 017 12 ) and the foundation for polish - german cooperation with funds provided by the federal republic of germany for the support .",
    "we would also like to thank both the erwin schrdinger institute and the albert einstein institute ( max plank institt fr gravitationsphysik ) for their hospitality , as much of the work was done while j.l . and",
    "were visiting these facilities .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the following theorem :    * theorem : * _ suppose that there is a hilbert space @xmath14 on which the diffeomorphism group @xmath519 acts unitarily through operators @xmath520 for @xmath15 . here , @xmath6 is some compact manifold .",
    "furthermore , suppose that there is a family of operators @xmath521 labeled by smooth real - valued functions on @xmath6 such that @xmath521 is linear in @xmath45 , and such that @xmath522 .",
    "then a state @xmath523 can belong to the common domain of all operators @xmath521 only if it is annihilated by them .",
    "_    note that we have not required @xmath521 to be symmetric or self - adjoint and that by definition laps functions have density weight zero . for a non - compact manifold @xmath6 the same conclusion holds provided @xmath521 is ` super linear ' with respect to a sum given by a partition of the unity .",
    "that assumption is satisfied by the rst - hamiltonian operators .",
    "since we have a large class of operators ( the rst - like constraints ) which are well - defined on @xmath524 and not all of @xmath43 is annihilated by the constraints , this theorem will show that there can be no hermitian inner product on @xmath0 such that the action of @xmath519 is unitary , unless it is very degenerate .    to prove the theorem ,",
    "consider the inner product @xmath525 and note that @xmath526 is a positive definite _ real _ bilinear product on smooth real functions @xmath45 and @xmath190 .",
    "this product is diffeomorphism invariant in the sense that @xmath527 for any diffeomorphism @xmath528 .",
    "let us begin by covering @xmath6 with coordinate charts @xmath529 .",
    "it is enough to show that @xmath530 for any @xmath45 supported in some fixed coordinate chart @xmath363 , since , due to the compactness of @xmath6 , the general case then follows from diffeomorphism invariance and linearity .",
    "let @xmath45 be supported in a chart @xmath531 .",
    "then , there exists a function @xmath190 supported in @xmath363 such that , for sufficiently large value of a parameter @xmath532 , the function @xmath533 is diffeomorphism equivalent to @xmath190 .",
    "indeed let @xmath190 be any smooth function which coincides with @xmath534 on @xmath369 .",
    "since @xmath45 is smooth and @xmath6 is compact , the first derivative @xmath535 must be bounded by some positive real number @xmath536 .",
    "thus , for @xmath537 , @xmath538 is a smooth monotonically increasing function of @xmath534 .",
    "since @xmath45 must vanish at the boundary of @xmath363 , @xmath539 on the boundary of @xmath363 and the map @xmath540 is a diffeomorphism . from the diffeomorphism invariance of the product @xmath541 , for @xmath542",
    ", we must have @xmath543 + \\lambda^{-2 } ( n , n)$ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath544 and @xmath545 must vanish . since @xmath545 is just the norm of @xmath546 in @xmath14 , we find that @xmath521 annihilates @xmath547 which completes the proof .",
