    "one of the most important unresolved questions in particle physics is how exactly the electroweak symmetry is broken .",
    "the standard model higgs mechanism provides ample motivation to come up with alternatives . an interesting new possibility is provided by higgsless models  @xcite with a warped extra dimension  @xcite",
    ". a higgs field localized on the ir brane of an rs background is decoupled by taking its vev to be very large , while the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons remain finite and are set by the size of the extra dimension .",
    "unitarity of the gauge boson scattering amplitudes can then be ensured via heavy kk gauge boson exchange .",
    "such models would solve the little hierarchy problem of randall - sundrum setups and have very distinctive phenomenological consequences .",
    "however , it is not clear whether these higgsless rs models can be made completely viable : a large correction to the s parameter makes it difficult to match electroweak precision data , the cutoff scale has to be adequately raised to ensure unitarization happens at weak coupling , and generically fcnc s are not adequately suppressed .",
    "many of these initial difficulties have been at least partially addressed .",
    "one can tune the effective s - parameter away by making the fermion left - handed fermion wave functions close to flat  @xcite , and choosing the right fermion representations can prevent the large top mass from introducing coupling deviations in the @xmath4-vertex  @xcite .",
    "the cutoff scale can also be raised by lowering the curvature of the extra dimension @xcite .",
    "however , once the fermion wave functions are required to be close to flat , the traditional anarchic rs approach to flavor  @xcite ( where fermion wave function overlaps generate fermion mass hierarchies and also give a protection called rs - gim against fcnc s @xcite ) can no longer be applied . a possible resolution to this problem",
    "is to introduce a genuine five - dimensional gim mechanism , which uses bulk symmetries to suppress flavor violation @xcite .",
    "the trick is to impose global flavor symmetries on the bulk , with a large subgroup left unbroken on the ir brane and flavor mixing forbidden anywhere except the uv brane .",
    "one can then construct a model where tree - level fcnc s are genuinely vanishing , with the downside that we are no longer trying to explain the quark mass and mixing hierarchies , merely accommodating them .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine the flavor bounds ( similar to  @xcite on higgsless models and to present a viable flavor construction for these theories ( see  @xcite for other examples in an rs context ) .",
    "we have to circumvent the problems usually associated with higgsless models by ensuring that    all fcncs are sufficiently suppressed ,    all tree - level electroweak precision constraints are satisfied ,    the cutoff scale is sufficiently high .    we show that the simplest versions of such a model can not be realistic : imposing an exact gim mechanism for all three generations either drives up the cutoff scale or prevents the s - parameter from being cancelled . instead",
    ", the realistic flavor model we propose will have next - to minimal flavor violation ( nmfv ) @xcite , featuring a custodially protected quark representation for the third generation , and an exact gim mechanism implemented for the first two generations only .",
    "this choice of representations allows us to isolate the lighter quarks from the dangerous top mass and prevent a large s - parameter without having to increase the bulk coupling and decrease the cutoff scale .",
    "flavor - changing neutral currents are controlled by two main mechanisms :    the surviving flavor symmetry between the first two generations forces all the mixing to go through the third generation ( hence nmfv ) , which is vital to reduce @xmath5 and @xmath6 mixing .",
    "kinetic mixing terms on the uv confine the right - handed fermions to the uv brane and reduce bulk contributions to the couplings , which are the source of off - diagonal neutral couplings .",
    "this results in an rs - gim - like flavor suppression mechanism for the right - handed fermions .",
    "we also have some freedom to distribute the required charged - current mixing amongst the up- and down - sectors , which reduces neutral - current mixing in each sector .",
    "all of this is necessary to sufficiently suppress flavor violation .",
    "we find that experimental fcnc bounds systematically constrain the down - sector mixing angles , forcing them to lie within a volume of angle space that is enclosed by a well - defined surface .",
    "_ assuming _ the uv kinetic mixing terms obey a cabibbo - type mixing hierarchy , this volume occupies @xmath7 of available angle space .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ s.background ] we review the 5d gim mechanism and introduce the quark representations we will be using",
    ". in section [ s.nmfv ] we outline our nmfv quark model and show compliance with electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) .",
    "we also examine in detail the errors introduced by the zero mode approximation , and find that one can have zero s - parameter without flatness , provided there is a lot of kk mixing on the ir brane .",
    "the flavor suppression mechanisms of the nmfv model are derived in section [ s.flavor ] and demonstrated with the gluon kk contribution to fcnc s in section [ s.fcncbounds ] .",
    "numerical results for the mixing constraints are presented in section [ s.numerical ] , and we conclude with section [ s.conclusion ] .",
    "after briefly reviewing the gauge sector , we will discuss the full 5d gim mechanism @xcite and how one could apply it to various simple quark models .",
    "this will motivate the construction of our next - to minimal flavor violation model in section [ s.nmfv ] .",
    "we work on an ads@xmath8 background and parameterize our space - time using conformal coordinates @xmath9 where the uv and ir branes sit at @xmath10 respectively .",
    "our gauge sector takes the standard rs form @xcite with @xmath11 on the ir brane , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "this means we have an @xmath12 gauge group  @xcite in the bulk ( where @xmath13 ) , which is broken by boundary conditions to @xmath14 on the uv brane and @xmath15 on the ir brane .",
    "the custodial @xmath16 symmetry protects the @xmath17 ratio from deviations at tree level , and the gauge boson mass is given by the size of the extra dimension . for future convenience ,",
    "let us define @xmath18 then to leading order in @xmath19 , @xmath20    on a technical note , we include all brane - localized gauge kinetic terms ( bkts ) that are allowed by symmetries , and include their corrections due to 1-loop running effects on their respective branes @xcite .",
    "this means that the effective @xmath21 bkt on the uv brane can be negative at the weak scale .",
    "we will also localize some fermions on the uv brane , making the effective @xmath22 bkt always positive ( but the effect is very small ) . unless otherwise mentioned , we set all _ effective _ bkts to zero at the weak scale except for @xmath22 , for which we set the bare term to zero .",
    "we also set the effective @xmath23 bkts to zero , but note that they could be made negative at the weak scale .",
    "in addition to the bkts , the free input parameters in the gauge sector are @xmath24 and the ratio @xmath25 . the sm @xmath26 masses then determine @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 at the weak scale set the overall size of the 5d couplings .",
    "all of our gauge bosons are canonically normalized , with all electroweak coupling corrections ( including @xmath31 and @xmath32 parameters ) pushed into interaction terms .",
    "our theory is valid up to a momentum cutoff , which in ads@xmath8 space is given conservatively by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the largest 5-dimensional coupling .",
    "if we take @xmath35 , then to leading order in @xmath19 the 4d coupling @xmath36 can be expressed as @xmath37 @xcite , which together with eq .",
    "( [ e.wmass ] ) gives @xmath38 if we had a physical higgs on the ir brane we could freely choose our kk scale and make the cutoff large , but in the higgsless model we must choose a low curvature to unitarize @xmath39-scattering before the theory becomes strongly coupled .",
    "we set @xmath40 which gives @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we also choose @xmath35 , since gauge matching would decrease the cutoff if we made the couplings different .",
    "the @xmath43 mass is therefore fixed and of order @xmath44 .",
    "our notation for a 5d dirac fermion will be @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are both lh 2-component weyl spinors , and hence @xmath48 is a rh 2-component spinor .",
    "we write the boundary conditions for each dirac spinor as @xmath49 at @xmath50 , where @xmath51 means @xmath52 and @xmath53 means @xmath54 .",
    "the normalized left - handed zero - mode profile is given by @xmath55 is the rs flavor function . the right - handed profile @xmath56 is defined identically , with @xmath57 .      for three generations of a given quark representation",
    "we can impose global flavor symmetries that prevent fcncs at tree - level while generating all the required masses and mixings @xcite . in broad strokes",
    ", those symmetries must satisfy the following criteria :    we need to have enough freedom to generate 6 different 4d quark masses and reproduce the ckm mixing matrix .    to ensure that flavor - violating operators are suppressed by the high scale @xmath58 , we only allow flavor mixing on the uv brane , via right - handed kinetic terms for the up and down sector independently .",
    "left - handed mixing is assumed to be forbidden by flavor symmetry , since otherwise the right- and left - handed kinetic terms can not be diagonalized simultaneously and there would be fcncs .    if we switch off the charged - current interactions we should be able to use the symmetries of the bulk and ir brane to diagonalize the uv mixing matrices .",
    "this makes the neutral currents diagonal in the 4d mass basis and forbids tree - level fcncs .",
    "we will now see how this mechanism can be applied to various simple quark models .",
    "the simplest potentially realistic quark representation is the left - right symmetric representation , which has been adopted in  @xcite : @xmath59 we impose the boundary conditions @xmath60 on @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) on @xmath63 to obtain left - handed and right - handed zero modes ( similarly for @xmath64 ) . on the ir brane ,",
    "both @xmath65 and @xmath66 are @xmath67 doublets , so we can write a dirac mass mixing term @xcite to lift the zero modes , @xmath68 on the uv brane , the @xmath66 doublet breaks up into two @xmath69 singlets , allowing us to assign brane - localized kinetic terms to @xmath63 and @xmath70 separately and supply the proper mass splitting .",
    "if we want to implement the full 5d gim mechanism using this representation , we populate the bulk with three copies of @xmath71 and impose flavor symmetries @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this makes the bulk masses @xmath74 and the ir dirac mass @xmath75 flavor blind . on the uv brane",
    "we allow only kinetic mixing of the @xmath66 fields , which take the form @xmath76 for both @xmath63 and @xmath70 , where @xmath77 are two independent hermitian matrices and @xmath78 are flavor indices . to forbid left - handed mixing",
    ", we impose the flavor symmetry @xmath79 .",
    "if we switch off the charged - current interactions , the @xmath80 symmetries become independent and @xmath81 , similarly in the bulk .",
    "these symmetries are broken on the uv brane , but we can use them to diagonalize the @xmath77 mixing matrices and end up with @xmath82 , which prevents tree - level fcncs . another way to see this is as follows : since all other mass and kinetic terms in the action are flavor singlets , we can go to the 4d mass basis by rotating the fermions in flavor space and diagonalizing @xmath83 .",
    "this pushes all the physical mixing into the charged - current couplings , giving us exactly the standard model ckm structure .",
    "the main problem with this model is the top quark . to make it heavy",
    ", we must localize it close to the ir brane and make @xmath75 large .",
    "the flavor symmetry then forces _ all _ the quarks to be close to the ir , generating a large negative @xmath31-parameter .",
    "the large flavor - blind @xmath75 has two additional dangerous effects : firstly , the @xmath84 mixing causes left - handed quarks to live partially in the @xmath24 representation ( and vice versa ) , which induces even more coupling corrections since it has the wrong quantum numbers .",
    "secondly , the @xmath85 mixing causes the light quarks to live partially in kk modes , resulting in dangerously high couplings to gauge kk modes .",
    "one could try to address these problems by increasing the @xmath67 ir kinetic term , which corresponds to adding a positive bare @xmath31 parameter on the ir brane , but this is not viable .",
    "the matching of gauge couplings would force the coupling in the bulk to increase , lowering our cutoff to @xmath86 and making the theory non - perturbative before the unitarization mechanism of higgsless rs models kicks in .",
    "we clearly need some way to protect the other quarks from deviations due to the heavy top mass .      focusing on the third generation only for a moment , the problem with the left - right symmetric representation is that the effects of the top mass are felt by the left - handed bottom ( we can localize the right - handed bottom on the uv brane ) .",
    "al  @xcite realized that deviations to those couplings could be avoided if    the @xmath88 is not in the same representation as any field which can mix with @xmath89 , so that the top can have a separate ir dirac mass that is not communicated to the bottom , and    the representations that house the left - handed @xmath90 are symmetric under @xmath91 interchange .",
    "this ensures that the @xmath19 and @xmath24 couplings are the same , meaning the @xmath89 couples to a linear combination of gauge bosons which is flat near the ir brane .",
    "its couplings are therefore protected from deviations due to the @xmath92 breaking .    in the notation of  @xcite ,",
    "the simplest representation which ( almost ) satisfies these requirements is : @xmath93 for the @xmath94 quarks we impose the same boundary conditions as for the quarks in the left - right symmetric representation , while we make the exotic @xmath32 , @xmath95 quarks ( with electric charge @xmath96 and @xmath1 respectively ) heavy by imposing mixed boundary conditions @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "on the ir brane , the @xmath101 bidoublet breaks down into an @xmath67 triplet and a singlet , which can mix with @xmath102 and @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath103 hence the allowed dirac mass term on the ir brane is @xmath104,\\ ] ] so we can make @xmath105 large to get a heavy top without influencing any field with the quantum numbers of the bottom . also note that the custodial protection granted by this representation is not complete : kk - mixing via the @xmath106 mass term causes the left - handed @xmath90 to live partially in @xmath107 , which is _ not _ part of a @xmath108 symmetric representation .",
    "symmetric we would have to extend @xmath102 to a @xmath109 . ]",
    "this turns out to be good thing , since the fully protected coupling is a few percent too large in higgsless models ( just the effect of the @xmath31-parameter ) .",
    "we can reduce it by localizing the @xmath107 closer to the uv brane , which increases @xmath106 ( for a given 4d bottom mass ) and hence increases kk - mixing .",
    "this in turn decreases the coupling , since it makes the lh bottom sensitive to the gauge boson profiles near the ir brane .",
    "the unique features of this representation allow us to implement the full 5d gim mechanism in a rather different fashion from the previous case . to protect the up and charm quarks from the heavy top",
    ", we make @xmath105 different for each quark generation and forbid all up - sector flavor mixing , including on the uv brane .",
    "the down sector symmetries , on the other hand , are chosen very similarly to the left - right symmetric representation : @xmath106 is flavor blind and large enough to generate the _ bottom _ mass , and a kinetic mixing matrix @xmath110 on the uv brane generates quark mixing in the down sector ( and hence all the physical quark mixing ) .",
    "this amounts to imposing the flavor symmetry @xmath111 , which gets broken down to @xmath112 on the ir brane , and @xmath113 on the uv brane ( we also set all brane kinetic terms for @xmath114 fields to zero ) .",
    "fcncs are prevented in the exact same fashion as for the left - right symmetric model , except we now only have to diagonalize the down sector .    nevertheless , a higgsless quark model using _ only _ the custodially protected representation is not viable .",
    "@xmath102 must be close to the uv to match @xmath115 to the sm .",
    "this fixes @xmath116 while leaving the @xmath101 bulk mass @xmath117 unconstrained due to custodial protection .",
    "the problem is a tension between the lh up - type couplings and the rh bottom coupling .",
    "@xmath118 can only be matched if @xmath119 uv , since it is not protected and suffers large corrections near the ir brane .",
    "@xmath120 has the opposite requirement . if @xmath106 is the minimal value to give @xmath121 , @xmath107 lives entirely in the bulk .",
    "it must therefore be close to the uv brane to make it insensitive to the broken symmetry on the ir brane , which is not a problem .",
    "however , if @xmath122 uv , then @xmath106 must be very large to generate @xmath121 , which increases kk mixing and makes @xmath120 sensitive to the ir brane again , reducing the coupling below sm .",
    "so while matching the lh up - type couplings to the sm requires @xmath123 uv , the rh bottom coupling requires @xmath119 ir .",
    "it is not possible to match both simultaneously .",
    "one might try to increase @xmath106 and confine the rh bottom to the uv brane , allowing @xmath101 to be closer to the uv , but this also increases @xmath32-mixing with the up - type quarks , which forces @xmath101 _ even closer _ to the uv to get a match .",
    "one can not achieve overlap .",
    "so while this model can protect the left - handed bottom couplings , the 5d gim mechanism forces _ all _ the up - type quarks to behave like the troublesome top , and their couplings can not be matched to the sm simultaneously with the rh bottom .",
    "the complete 5d gim mechanism is too restrictive for higgsless rs model - building .",
    "we have to give up a some flavor protection in exchange for agreement with electroweak precision data , while ensuring that fcncs are still under control .",
    "this motivates us to combine both representations in a single quark model with _ next - to minimal flavor violation _ , harnessing their complementing strengths while keeping as much flavor symmetry as possible .",
    "two copies of @xmath71 with bulk masses @xmath74 make up the first two generations , while the third generation is contained in the custodially protected @xmath124 with bulk masses @xmath125 .",
    "this protects the other quarks from the influence of the heavy top while enabling us to match all fermion couplings to experimental data .",
    "( note that the top couplings are poorly constrained . )",
    "the form of the respective ir dirac mass terms are given in equations ( [ e.lrsymirterm ] ) and ( [ e.custodialirterm ] ) .",
    "we impose the flavor symmetry @xmath126 in the bulk , which is broken down to @xmath127 on the ir brane .",
    "this means that the first two generations have the same ir dirac mass @xmath75 and bulk masses .",
    "the third generation has the ir dirac masses @xmath106 for the @xmath67 triplet ( which includes the bottom ) and @xmath105 for the singlet ( which supplies mass to the top ) . to provide flavor mixing and differentiate the quark masses of the first two generations",
    ", we must introduce general hermitian @xmath128 kinetic mixing matrices @xmath129 and @xmath110 as in eq .",
    "( [ e.kineticterm ] ) .",
    "therefore , the flavor symmetry on the uv brane is @xmath79 ( where the third @xmath65 is contained in @xmath101 ) .",
    "we can see immediately that there will be fcncs in this model .",
    "the flavor symmetry is explicitly broken by choosing a different quark representation for the third generation .",
    "if we switch off the charged currents , we only have @xmath0 symmetries available , which are not enough to diagonalize the kinetic mixing matrices on the uv brane .",
    "however , as we will see , this partial symmetry is enough to force all mixing to go ` through the third generation ' and suppress 12-mixings .",
    "we can solve the bulk equations with the appropriate bc s to compute the entire kk tower of fermion wave functions .",
    "after integrating out the 5@xmath130 dimension , we end up with a 4d action containing the following terms ( using matrix notation in flavor / kk space ) : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a gauge boson kk index , @xmath133 is a diagonal matrix of the right - handed fermion wave functions evaluated at @xmath134 , and @xmath83 is the uv brane kinetic mixing matrix .    to go to 4d mass basis , we must first diagonalize and canonically normalize the kinetic mixing term by rotating the rh spinors with a hermitian matrix @xmath135 .",
    "once the kinetic terms are flavor singlets we can diagonalize the mass matrices with the usual biunitary transformation .",
    "we will always distinguish quantities in the physical basis with a ` mass ' superscript from quantities in the original flavor basis without superscript .",
    "the quark spinors in the mass basis are related to the flavor basis in the following way : @xmath136 applying this transformation to the the mass terms , the left / right - handed neutral couplings ( denoted generically by @xmath137/@xmath138 ) , and the left / right - handed @xmath2 couplings , we get : @xmath139 there is a very useful relation which we will need later .",
    "we simply write out @xmath140 ( since @xmath141 is diagonal ) .",
    "keeping in mind that the @xmath135 matrices are hermitian and @xmath142 , we find @xmath143    the exotic x - quark with charge @xmath1 is an interesting experimental signature of our model . its mass is roughly half a @xmath144 and it couples to the top via charged - current interactions ( in the flavor basis ) with coupling strength comparable to but generically less than @xmath145 .",
    "the coupling in the mass basis is @xmath146 detection could be possible at the lhc with less than @xmath147 pb@xmath148 of integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see why this model can satisfy electroweak precision constraints .",
    "the heavy top mass does not influence the other quarks , and the correct bottom couplings can be achieved by moving @xmath149 and @xmath88 close to the ir brane , while the @xmath150 is close to the uv @xcite .",
    "the top couplings will deviate from the sm value , but this is acceptable since it is poorly constrained experimentally .",
    "the first- and second - generation couplings can be made to agree with the sm by adjusting  @xmath151 , and we have enough freedom to choose ir dirac masses and uv kinetic terms to generate all the different quark masses and mixings .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath152 bulk masses can take on a range of values , due to the effect of kk - mixing which we will discuss in section [ ss.zeromode ] .",
    "we explicitly demonstrated ewpd compliance using two different numerical calculations . in the first",
    ", we assumed that there is no flavor mixing and absorbed the diagonal boundary terms into bc s . in the second",
    "there was flavor mixing , and we followed the procedure of section [ ss.4dmassbasis ] : using the zero mode approximation in which the boundary terms act as mixing terms between zero modes and kk modes .",
    "one of the canonical signatures of higgsless models are light gauge kk - modes with a mass of @xmath153 .",
    "this is low enough to warrant closer inspection of current cdf bounds @xcite to make sure our model is not already excluded .",
    "the cdf searches for heavy gauge bosons focus on resonant pair production processes of the form ( light quark pair ) @xmath154 ( heavy gauge boson ) @xmath154 ( some fermion pair , e.g. @xmath155 ) . assuming that the coupling to the heavy gauge boson is the same as to the sm counterpart for both the initial and final fermion states , the cdf bounds are @xmath156 .",
    "however , those bounds must be adjusted for our model since the coupling of gauge kk modes is very suppressed for the first two quark generations , and somewhat enhanced for the third generation .",
    "@xmath157 since the light left - handed quarks are not uv - localized , their couplings depend sensitively on the bulk masses and can be very small .",
    "leptons in our model would have similar couplings to the light quarks .",
    "it is clear that the coupling suppression increases the @xmath158 bounds from leptonic and @xmath159-channel searches way beyond our kk - scale of 700 gev . due to low @xmath160-detection efficiencies ,",
    "the @xmath161-channel also does not supply a meaningful @xmath162 bound @xcite .    only the constraints on @xmath163 from @xcite",
    "require closer inspection .",
    "their analysis assumed vector - like couplings to @xmath164 which were parameterized as @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the bounds on @xmath163 depend on @xmath167 and the width @xmath168 of @xmath164 .",
    "if we assume that we can use those bounds for our _ chiral _ couplings by simply averaging and setting @xmath169 , we can extract an approximate bound of @xmath170 on the width of our kk - gluon if its mass is @xmath171 .",
    "we have not calculated the width of the @xmath164 since it depends on several parameters that are not completely fixed in our model , but @xmath172 is not an atypical value for rs kk - gluons , see for example @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can also decrease @xmath173 by another factor of @xmath174 by taking into account 1-loop rge corrections to the @xmath175 uv brane kinetic term , as outlined in section [ ss.gaugesector ] .",
    "this alleviates any concern that our model might be excluded by cdf bounds .",
    "however , the relatively light @xmath164 should certainly be detected at the lhc .",
    "each @xmath176 hermitian uv kinetic mixing matrix @xmath77 is defined by @xmath177 parameters , @xmath178 real elements and @xmath179 complex phases . for @xmath180 ,",
    "this gives a total of 12 real parameters and 6 phases .",
    "we can always do an @xmath181 flavor rotation , which corresponds to eliminating unphysical parameters : it removes 1 angle and 3 phases .",
    "this leaves us with 11 real parameters and 3 phases , which includes the 6 quark masses .",
    "hence the parameters in the flavor sector are 6 quark masses , 5 mixing angles and 3 phases , as well as 3 ir dirac masses @xmath182 and @xmath106 .    at this point a remark about the _ size _ of the uv kinetic terms is in order .",
    "the @xmath83 matrix elements will be very large , generically @xmath183 r$ ] , but this is no cause for concern .",
    "after canonically normalizing , the magnitude of the @xmath6 s will merely specify what fraction of the fermions lives on the uv brane ( i.e. is elementary in the ads / cft picture ) , and how much lives in the bulk ( i.e. is composite ) . in our model the right - handed quarks",
    "are almost entirely confined to the uv brane , only slightly dipping into the bulk to mix with the left - handed quarks on the ir brane and generate a dirac mass .",
    "the fermion zero mode approximation enormously simplifies matching and mixing calculations , and we can use it to gain a great deal of insight into the flavor protection mechanisms of our model .",
    "however , kk mixing is much more significant for higgsless models than for standard rs with multi - tev kk masses , so we need to investigate the range of validity of this approximation in detail if we want to trust our calculations .",
    "consider a simple toy - model with a single generation of quarks in the left - right symmetric representation eq .",
    "( [ e.qlqrdef ] ) .",
    "there is a dirac mass term on the ir brane ( [ e.lrsymirterm ] ) and a uv boundary kinetic term for the right - handed fields ( [ e.kineticterm ] ) . focusing only on the _ left - handed _",
    "fields for the moment , we can incorporate the ir dirac mass term into the @xmath184 boundary conditions of the 5d wave function profiles @xcite , eliminating kk - mixing on the ir brane : @xmath185 similarly for the down sector .",
    "we will assume that the errors are small and @xmath186 .",
    "if there was no ir mixing , @xmath187 would just be the zero mode @xmath188 ( i.e. @xmath189 from eq .  ( [ e.zeromode ] ) with @xmath190 ) , and adding a small amount of mixing should not change the shape of that waveform significantly .",
    "the new mode that appears due to mixing is @xmath191 , and its shape is also independent of the size of a small mass .",

    "<S> we examine various possibilities for realistic 5d higgsless models and construct a full quark sector featuring next - to - minimal flavor violation ( with an exact bulk @xmath0 protecting the first two generations ) satisfying electroweak and flavor constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the `` new custodially protected representation '' is used for the third generation to protect the light quarks from flavor violations induced due to the heavy top . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of flavor symmetries , and rs - gim for the right - handed quarks suppresses flavor - changing neutral currents below experimental bounds , assuming ckm - type mixing on the uv brane . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the usual higgsless rs signals , this model predicts an exotic charge-@xmath1 quark with mass of about 0.5 tev which should show up at the lhc very quickly , as well as nonzero flavor - changing neutral currents which could be detected in the next generation of flavor experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in the course of our analysis , we also find quantitative estimates for the errors of the fermion zero mode approximation , which are significant for higgsless - type models .    </S>",
