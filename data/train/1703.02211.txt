    "casimir @xcite and van der waals @xcite forces are the subject of a mature research area @xcite enjoying a renaissance @xcite since the first precision measurement of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "current theory @xcite is able to predict the force between macroscopic bodies with an accuracy only limited by the knowledge of the material parameters .",
    "yet surprisingly @xcite after almost 70 years of research , while theory describes the casimir force _ between _ bodies , the force _ inside _ macroscopic bodies is poorly understood . in this paper , we develop from a physically intuitive picture the macroscopic theory of the stress that gives rise to casimir forces inside inhomogeneous planar media .",
    "our result agrees with a previous _ ad hoc _",
    "procedure @xcite , giving both mathematical and physical justification to a conjecture that was only tested numerically so far .",
    "our theory is likely to be extendable ; it may open the gate to the computation of casimir forces inside arbitrary materials .    in piece ",
    "wise homogeneous media , the casimir force acts only upon boundaries @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _  between bodies . in inhomogeneous media",
    ", the casimir effect may act inside the material . in solids ,",
    "the casimir stress is negligible in comparison with the interatomic forces , but in fluids it may build up sufficient pressure to force fluids to move until an equilibrium is reached .",
    "this internal casimir force is particularly strong near edges in the refractive  index profile @xcite .",
    "our paper develops the theoretical tools for predicting how inhomogeneous fluids respond to casimir forces .",
    "we consider the simplest non  trivial class of inhomogeneous materials : planar media .",
    "these are materials where the electric permittivity @xmath0 and magnetic permeability @xmath1 vary in only one spatial direction .",
    "we also assume that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are scalars ( isotropic media ) .",
    "note that in using @xmath0 and @xmath1 we are using the concepts of macroscopic electromagnetism @xcite ; we do not need to resort to the microscopic properties of materials .",
    "our theory thus indicates that macroscopic electromagnetism  plus quantum fluctuations  is sufficient to predict the casimir force , which is far from being obvious .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    let us begin by developing heuristic arguments and intuitive pictures for casimir forces , visualizing the theoretical problems they pose and our solutions .",
    "the root of the problem has been the interplay between quantum fluctuations and electromagnetism that creates the casimir force in the first place .",
    "figure [ quantumnoise ] illustrates two fundamentally different theoretical concepts of quantum fluctuations .",
    "one is casimir s idea @xcite  inspired by bohr @xcite  that vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are responsible for the effect ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]a ) , the other schwinger s concept @xcite  lifshitz theory @xcite is consistent with  of fluctuating sources interacting with the electromagnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]b ) . in casimir",
    "s picture ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]a ) the zero  point energy of the electromagnetic quantum field in and around materials creates the force , in schwinger s ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]b ) the field is not even required to be quantized @xcite . here ,",
    "quantum fluctuations in the material induce oscillating dipoles at each point ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]b ) .",
    "each dipole sends out an electromagnetic wave , the wave explores the surroundings , and when some part of the wave is scattered back to the source it interacts with it . in schwinger",
    "s picture ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]b ) the interaction of each fluctuating dipole with the backscattered wave creates the casimir force .",
    "both pictures harbour similar hidden problems : infinities . in casimir",
    "s picture ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]a ) the zero  point energy @xmath2 sums up the vacuum energies of all the allowed electromagnetic modes with eigenfrequencies @xmath3 : @xmath4 one sees this pictorially from trying to plot ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]a ) the electric field strength in the vacuum state for casimir s classic example @xcite , the vacuum in the cavity between two perfectly reflecting mirrors @xcite . adding more and more cavity modes produces finer and finer details in the fluctuating field , while the amplitude grows without bound .",
    "yet casimir @xcite managed to extract the part from the diverging series in eq .",
    "( [ infinity ] ) that actually does physical work and found a finite force .",
    "procedures that achieve this are called _",
    "renormalisation_. in the zeta ",
    "function renormalisation @xcite , for example , the eigenfrequencies in eq .",
    "( [ infinity ] ) are raised to the power @xmath5 for complex @xmath6 , which defines an analytic function of @xmath6 where the series converges .",
    "the analytic continuation to @xmath7 then assigns a finite value to eq .",
    "( [ infinity ] ) which happens to agree with casimir s original calculation @xcite .",
    "an infinity also mars schwinger s picture of fluctuating sources ( fig .",
    "[ quantumnoise]b ) , but we suggest one can identify and remove the issue in a physically motivated way ( fig .",
    "[ pointsplit ] ) .",
    "the infinity comes from the interaction of each dipole with itself , which poses already a problem in the classical theory of electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "there one must explicitly forbid point charges to directly interact with themselves .",
    "in lifshitz @xcite and schwinger s @xcite theory each point of the medium is mentally split into two points , that we view as emitter and receiver ( fig .",
    "[ pointsplit]a ) infinitesimally close to each other .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the emitter generate electromagnetic waves the receiver responds to .",
    "the contribution due to the wave directly going from emitter to receiver ( fig .",
    "[ pointsplit]b ) is deemed unphysical and removed .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    lifshitz @xcite and schwinger s @xcite theory works well for arbitrary piece  wise homogeneous planar materials @xcite ; it also agrees with casimir s original result @xcite for the special case of a perfect cavity .",
    "however , the theory fails for inhomogeneous media @xcite , for the following reason .",
    "the outgoing wave does not only perceive the electromagnetic properties of the material at the point of emission , but also in its vicinity , even if emitter and receiver are infinitesimally close .",
    "the near field does not only depend on the local values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but also on their first spatial derivatives ( see sec .",
    "ii and appendix a ) .",
    "this feature is ignored in lifshitz @xcite and schwinger s @xcite theory , although it appears to be inevitable in macroscopic electromagnetism @xcite where each mathematical point of the material is not a physical point , but rather represents the collective effect of a very great number of molecules generating the electromagnetic response of the material @xcite .",
    "now , if the dielectric properties of the material vary , both the outgoing wave and the scattered wave depends on them .",
    "how does one distinguish the outgoing wave ?",
    "this is the theoretical problem in a nutshell . in this paper",
    "we apply geometrical optics and insights from transformation optics @xcite to identify the outgoing wave ( fig .",
    "[ outgoing ] ) .",
    "we achieve this for arbitrary planar @xmath0 and @xmath1 , not only for the case @xmath8 when transformation optics is exact @xcite . this outgoing wave",
    "is then removed from the interaction between emitter and receiver .",
    "we prove ( appendix b ) that this renormalization removes the principal divergences of the casimir stress and we believe that the remaining stress is the complete physical one .",
    "as the emitter perceives its environment beyond the immediate point of emission , the outgoing wave depends on the local dielectric properties and their derivatives .",
    "how many derivatives does one need to take into account ? in this paper",
    "we use a quadratic expansion of the local material parameters ( fig .",
    "[ quadratic ] ) .",
    "we have seen that a linear expansion is insufficient ( appendix c ) ; the quadratic expansion is the simplest one that works .",
    "moreover , as waves are oscillations in space and time described by a second  order wave equation , one needs at least two infinitesimal steps to establish a wave , which might explain why one needs a quadratic expansion for identifying the outgoing wave .    ]    ]    note that similar ideas have been proposed before in attempts @xcite to renormalize the energy ",
    "momentum tensor of the quantum vacuum in general relativity @xcite . there",
    "the singularities of the emitted wave are removed by subtracting certain waves defined in quadratic expansion .",
    "this procedure did almost work , were it not for a logarithmic singularity .",
    "now , one knows from transformation optics @xcite that certain magneto  electric materials with @xmath8",
    "correspond to space ",
    "time geometries in general relativity .",
    "so why does the same problem not occur in our theory ?",
    "in classical general relativity @xcite the equivalence principle requires that the medium of space and time acts the same on all waves , regardless of wavelength : space  time is dispersionless . yet ordinary materials are dispersive ; @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend on frequency @xmath9 and approach unity in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "we show in appendix a that dispersion removes the logarithmic singularity in the stress .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the previous papers @xcite we give simple explicit expressions for the regularizer that are ready for immediate use in numerical calculations .",
    "dispersion has also been the problem in the _ ad hoc _ generalization @xcite of lifshitz theory @xcite to inhomogeneous planar media @xcite .",
    "while our renormalizer turns out to be identical to the one proposed there @xcite , the numerical examples @xcite are incorrect , as they are for nondispersive media . in truth ,",
    "the stress diverges there , but only logarithmically , which is not easy to see numerically ( because `` the logarithm is a good approximation for a constant ''  l. d. landau ) .",
    "moreover and more importantly , our paper gives mathematical proof beyond numerics that the renormalization works ( see appendix b ) and adds a physical picture to the _ ad hoc _ renormalizer @xcite , a picture that also seems valid beyond planar media .",
    "quantum field theory in curved space @xcite and _ ad hoc _ renormalization @xcite have not been the only attempts in developing a theory for the casimir stress inside materials .",
    "other theories have been proposed as well @xcite including the perspective of going beyond standard macroscopic electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "zeta - function renormalization has been tried @xcite , but as the authors put it @xcite : `` the functional dependence of the needed counterterms is very involved and the classical model necessary for renormalization lacks physical intuition as well as motivation '' , which is what we hope to facilitate in our paper .",
    "in this section we substantiate the physical arguments and visualizations of the introduction by theoretical calculations .",
    "we begin with a brief summary of lifshitz theory in planar media .",
    "consider a planar isotropic medium with scalar @xmath0 and @xmath1 depending on the cartesian coordinate @xmath11 and frequency @xmath9 .",
    "we define the refractive index @xmath12 and impedance @xmath13 as @xmath14 the casimir  force density @xmath15 inside the material is the divergence of the casimir stress @xmath16 , the minkowski stress in the vacuum state @xcite . for planar",
    "isotropic media the stress tensor is diagonal @xcite and hence only @xmath17 makes a contribution to the force : @xmath18 according to lifshitz theory @xcite the physically relevant stress component @xmath17 is given by the formula @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath21 denotes the imaginary wave number to the frequency @xmath22 , and @xmath23 abbreviates the expression @xmath24 while the @xmath25 denote @xmath26 for the two polarizations e and m of the electromagnetic waves in the planar medium .",
    "the polarizations are defined as follows : in the e ",
    "polarization , the electric field vector lies in the plane orthogonal to @xmath11 ( and is orthogonal to the wave vector ) , in the m  polarization it is the magnetic field . the scalar green functions @xmath27 satisfy the wave equation @xcite @xmath28 they describe for the two polarizations the amplitudes of electromagnetic waves emitted at @xmath29 and received at @xmath30 . according to the point ",
    "splitting method , one calculates the stress first for @xmath31 and then takes the limit @xmath32 .",
    "note that the green functions are real , because @xmath0 and @xmath1 are real for purely imaginary frequencies @xcite .",
    "close to the point of emission the field diverges .",
    "there the derivatives in eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) outweigh @xmath33 such that we can ignore this term : electrostatics ( @xmath34 ) dominates the near field .",
    "close to the emission point we can also ignore any spatial variations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; the green equation ( [ green ] ) reduces to the poisson equation with the solution @xmath35 which shows the principal , coulomb  type singularity of the field at the point of emission .",
    "however , as the stress depends on derivatives of the green functions , see eq .",
    "( [ stress ] ) , further details of the near field become important .",
    "they call for more careful consideration , as follows .",
    "let us fourier  transform the green functions with respect to the spatial coordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 the electromagnetic functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not depend on .",
    "we obtain from eq .",

    "( [ fourier ] ) indicates .",
    "the lifshitz regularisation @xcite assumes the medium to be homogenous in the vicinity of the emission point . for an infinitely extended homogenous medium ,",
    "we obtain for eq .",
    "( [ gdiff ] ) the retarded solutions @xmath44 substituting the two @xmath45 into the expression for the stress , eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) , we see that @xmath17 diverges like @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a cut  off of each of the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) .",
    "however , more careful analysis ( appendix a ) reveals that the unrenormalized , bare stress diverges like @xmath48 with the terms @xmath49 the primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath50 of the logarithm is complicated ( appendix a ) but turns out to vanish for physical media with dispersion where @xmath0 and @xmath1 depend on frequency and approach unity for @xmath51 ( appendix a ) .",
    "the other two singularities do not disappear in general , although @xmath52 becomes linear due to the @xmath40integration , as the near field of the emitter is an evanescent field @xcite that contains arbitrarily large spatial fourier components , even for finite frequencies .",
    "we recover the @xmath46 lifshitz divergence , but we have also obtained a @xmath53 or @xmath47 singularity when @xmath0 or @xmath1 depend on @xmath11 .",
    "the latter is the mathematical reason why the original lifshitz renormalization @xcite fails in inhomogeneous planar media @xcite .      in order to renormalize the casimir stress one should subtract from the green function @xmath54 the near field @xmath55 of the emitter : @xmath56 in the original lifshitz renormalization @xcite @xmath57",
    "is given by eq .",

    "( [ fourier ] ) for the stress one gets @xmath60 with exactly the terms of eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) and hence all the singularites , apart from the logarithmic one .",
    "as the latter disappears for dispersive media , we have thus proved mathematically that this renormalizer does indeed remove all the physically relevant singularities of the casimir stress in planar media .",
    "one might be content with eq .",
    "( [ adhoc ] ) were it not for the unsettling thought that removing the infinity is necessary but not sufficient for identifying the correct renormalization .",
    "subtracting one infinity from the other does not guarantee the right result , because the correct renormalizer might also make a finite contribution to the remaining finite stress , correcting it .",
    "in addition to the mathematical requirement of cancelling the singularities , a physical motivation is essential , which is what we are going to develop now .",
    "figure [ pointsplit ] shows the physical picture we have in mind : the renormalizer removes the wave directly going from emitter to receiver , because this wave describes the unphysical interaction of the dipole with itself ( mentally split into emitter and receiver ) .",
    "given that the near field depends on both the values and the derivatives of the material parameters , as eqs .",
    "( [ singularities]-[a4 ] ) indicate , how can we distinguish the outgoing from the scattered wave ?",
    "scattering is a deviation from geometrical optics , because in geometrical optics a flash of light would just propagate along the ray trajectories ; nothing is reflected there  nothing is scattered .",
    "hence we identify the outgoing wave by geometrical optics .",
    "since the defining feature  the flash of light  is a feature of wave propagation in physical , three - dimensional space , we consider geometrical optics in real space , not in fourier space , but then transform our result for use in the fourier method ( appendix b ) .",
    "first we cast the wave equation in geometrical form . in the rest of the paper",
    "we drop the polarization index p for keeping the notation uncluttered .",

    "( [ d0 ] ) with respect to time that @xmath78 corresponds to the flash of light @xmath84 along the geodesics , which shows that @xmath78 is the outgoing wave .",
    "geometrical optics gives the outgoing wave , but it turns out we also need to consider the next  order correction . for finding it , we write the phase as @xmath85 and consider the leading correction @xmath86 to the @xmath78 of geometrical optics : @xmath87 to first order in @xmath88 we obtain from eqs .",

    "of course , higher  order corrections will then let the wave recede .",
    "note that geometric dispersion is the primary case of scattering in an inhomogeneous medium without sharp boundaries , as scattering is the deviation of wave propagation from geometrical optics and @xmath86 is the leading correction ; @xmath86 describes the first reflection the outgoing wave encounters . according to huygen s principle @xcite",
    ", we can view the wave propagation as a continuous succession of propagations ( @xmath78 ) and reflections ( @xmath86 ) .",
