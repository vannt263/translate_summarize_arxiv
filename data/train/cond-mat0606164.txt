    "in recent years there has been a renewed interest in the analysis of the dynamical behavior at critical attractors in low dimensional maps . in such situations ,",
    "criticality is triggered by the vanishing of the lyapunov coefficient ( coefficients in dimension higher than one ) so that ordinary chaos paradigms are not applicable .",
    "part of this interest is because tsallis functional forms ( the so - called @xmath0-exponential and @xmath0-logarithm ) were found to mimic the role that the ordinary exponential and logarithm have in the usual theory of chaos ( although , as we will see below , in a more complex and sophisticated sense ) .",
    "in fact , exact renormalization group ( rg ) solutions for the sensitivity to initial conditions at these critical attractors are found to assume the structure of ( infinite families of ) @xmath0-exponential functions .",
    "this paper attempts to rationalize in a single review some of the most relevant new results that stemmed from the application of exact rg approaches to critical attractors of low dimensional maps @xcite .",
    "this research work moved from the understanding that rg techniques developed in the 80s for describing the static properties of the maps could indeed be extended in order to solve in all details the dynamical behavior at critical attractors . then , contact with tsallis and mori s formalisms were established _ a posteriori_.",
    "the final result is the identification of a universal , intricate , dynamical mechanism common to the three paradigmatic routes to chaos of period doubling , intermittency and quasiperiodicity .",
    "another important result conveyed by the rg approach at the chaos threshold of the logistic map is the determination of the exponent characterizing the decay of correlations in presence of an external noise source @xcite . by realizing that such an iteration equation is a discrete version of langevin s equation and that the underlying scenario is that of an ergodic to non - ergodic transition , one can in fact produce a `` translation dictionary '' between the dynamical behavior of the logistic map with additive noise and the phenomenology observed for a glass former .",
    "translated words include adam - gibbs formula , time translation invariance and @xmath1-relaxation , aging , subdiffusion and arrest .",
    "there is a further interesting mechanism through which aging and weak ergodicity breaking can be obtained in low dimensional maps .",
    "this mechanism is related to the dynamical behavior close to the origin of a manneville - like map ( see below ) and can be statistically described in terms of the continuous time random walk formalism .",
    "such a discussion is however out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for an appropriate account .",
    "the paper is divided in two main sections .",
    "section [ routes ] is devoted to the dynamical picture underlying the above mentioned routes to chaos . in section [ glassy ]",
    "we describe the analogies between the behavior of the logistic map with additive noise and that of a glass former . finally , some remarks are added .",
    "in the following , we will be mainly considering unimodal maps , i.e. , discrete - time iterated maps governed by the equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 $ ] is the control parameter and @xmath4 the non linearity order of the maximum at @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "important quantities for the dynamics at the onset of chaos are the diameters of the bifurcation forks @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , which are defined as the distances of two nearest neighbors attractor points in a super - stable cycle .",
    "as we will see , in the limit @xmath23 these diameters contain all the information about the multifractal attractor at the onset of chaos .",
    "the chaos threshold @xmath19 is the accumulation point of both pitchfork bifurcations and super - stable cycles .    for @xmath24",
    ", @xmath14 is positive except in an numerable number of intervals which are again characterized by a periodic attractor .",
    "the left extreme of such intervals is determined by a tangent bifurcation where @xmath14 vanishes . inside each interval ,",
    "a new pitchfork bifurcation cascades produces a ( higher order ) chaos threshold before reaching the right extreme of the interval , so that the final result is an intricate and fascinating self - similar structure .",
    "the study of unimodal maps marked an era in chaos theory .",
    "for example , the pitchfork cascade has been identified to occur in chemical reactions , optically bistable systems , electrical rcl oscillators , sound waves in water , bnard convection fluid experiments , ",
    "@xcite . also , the tangent bifurcation with the addition of a reinjection mechanism is the paradigm for the phenomenon of ( type i ) intermittency and @xmath25-noise observed , e.g. , in nonlinear rcl oscillators and in bnard convection @xcite .",
    "the elegance and richness of this self - similar structure stimulated a number of theoretical results starting from the late @xmath26 s .",
    "perhaps the milestone was the rg approach developed by feigenbaum @xcite and , independently , by coullet and tresser @xcite for the pitchfork bifurcations cascade .",
    "this work was extended by the group of politi @xcite and that of mori @xcite that focused on the properties of the fluctuation spectrum of generalized algebraic lyapunov coefficients .",
    "an exact solution for the tangent bifurcation dynamics was found by hu and rudnick @xcite .",

    ", [ eq_subdiffusion ] where @xmath167 the diffusion process displayed by the map in eq .",
    "( [ eq_subdiffusion ] ) reproduces the crossover normal / sub - diffusion / arrest as @xmath85 tends to zero @xcite .",
    "several nonlinear dissipative systems , like those mentioned in this review , exhibit both regular and chaotic behavior depending on some external parameter .",
    "the transition from regularity to chaoticity implies a dramatic alteration in the dynamical behavior , the situation changing from an exponentially fast _ insensitivity _ to initial conditions to an exponentially fast _ sensitivity _ to initial conditions .",
    "there are only few possible mechanisms through which such transitions occur .",
    "these are the well known ( universal ) routes to chaos .",
    "thus , when the external parameters are tuned _ at _ the transition point , the ordinary lyapunov coefficients vanish and they do not allow to extract significant trends characterizing the critical dynamics . under these conditions , intricate oscillations typically appear . since these oscillations are reminiscent of the regular behavior , the possibility arises to characterize the dynamics exactly if one accepts to describe it via a set of specific temporal subsequences .    here",
    "we have given an account of the extension of the static rg approaches , discovered in the 80 s , to the dynamics at the critical attractors of period doubling , intermittency and quasiperiodicity routes to chaos @xcite .",
    "the outcome of this extension , obtained basically from an _ a priori _ approach , are significant new results that enlarge considerably the previous knowledge .",
    "for example , it is now clear that all the properties found for the sensitivity to initial conditions are associated to the discontinuities of feigenbaum s universal @xmath85 scaling function for the bifurcation cascade onset of chaos @xcite ( with an analogous extension for the quasiperiodic critical attractor @xcite ) . in the language of tsallis functional forms these properties",
    "can be read as tsallis generalization of the lyapunov coefficient that exhibits a new spectrum of behaviors ranging from weaker to stronger than exponential laws @xcite .",
    "also , precise contact with the formalism of mori s dynamical transitions at the transition point and the fixed @xmath0-parameter in tsallis formalism has been established @xcite . in view of this relation on can conclude that the dynamics for the period doubling and the quasiperiodic critical attractors is in fact characterized by an infinite number of mori s dynamical transitions @xcite , in place of the single one known previously . in relation to a recent debate in the literature @xcite ,",
    "let us then conclude that the novel exact knowledge on the critical dynamics obtained in @xcite puts into a different fresh context the fundamental scaling laws discovered in the 80 s for these nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "as an example of how to implement the detailed knowledge of the dynamics at the period doubling onset of chaos , we have reported @xcite that specific parallels with the behavior of a glass former close to the glass transition can be established if one adds a noise term to the logistic map equation .",
    "of course through this very simple one - dimensional system we can aim only at qualitative analogies with respect to the behavior of a supercooled liquid close to the glass transition , nevertheless these similarities have the appeal of allowing a precise numerical and analytical inspection .",
