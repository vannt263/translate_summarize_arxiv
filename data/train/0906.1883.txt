    "it is well known that stochastic integrals can be interpreted as vector measures , the identification being given by the identity @xmath1 here , the driving process @xmath2 is a ( semi)martingale ( for instance , a brownian motion ) , and @xmath3 is a stochastic process satisfying suitable measurability and integrability conditions .",
    "this observation has been used by various authors as the starting point of a theory of stochastic integration for vector - valued processes .",

    "indeed , we established the it isomorphism @xmath10 the linear subspace of all operators in @xmath9 of the form @xmath11 for some function @xmath12 is dense , but unless @xmath4 has cotype @xmath13 it is strictly smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "this means that in general there are operators @xmath14 which are not representable by an @xmath4-valued function . since the space of test functions @xmath15 embeds in @xmath16 , by restriction one could still think of such operators as @xmath4-valued distributions .",
    "it may be more intuitive , however , to think of @xmath17 as an @xmath4-valued vector measure .",
    "we shall prove ( see theorem [ thm:2 ] and the subsequent remark ) that if @xmath4 does not contain a closed subspace isomorphic to @xmath18 , then the space @xmath9 is isometrically isomorphic in a natural way to the space of @xmath4-valued vector measures on @xmath19 which are of bounded @xmath0-variation .",
    "this gives a ` measure theoretic ' description of the class of admissible integrands for stochastic integrals with respect to brownian motions .",
    "the condition @xmath20 can be removed if we replace the space of @xmath0-radonifying operators by the larger space of all @xmath0-summing operators ( which contains the space of all @xmath0-radonifying operators isometrically as a closed subspace ) .",
    "vector measures of bounded @xmath0-variation behave quite differently from vector measures of bounded variation .",
    "for instance , the question whether an @xmath4-valued vector measure of bounded @xmath0-variation can be represented by an @xmath4-valued function is not linked to the radon - nikodm property , but rather to the type @xmath13 and cotype @xmath13 properties of @xmath4 ( see corollaries [ type ] and [ cotype ] ) .    in section [ sec : randomised ] we consider yet another class of vector measures whose variation is given by certain random sums , and we show that a function @xmath5 is stochastically integrable with respect to a brownian motion @xmath6}$ ] on a probability space @xmath21 if and only if the formula @xmath22 defines an @xmath23-valued vector measure @xmath24 in this class .",

    "furthermore , every vector measure which is of bounded @xmath0-variation is of bounded @xmath13-semivariation .    in order to give a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector measure to have bounded @xmath0-variation we need to introduce the following terminology . a bounded operator @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a hilbert space , is said to be _ @xmath0-summing _ if there exists a constant @xmath39 such that for all finite orthonormal systems @xmath40 in @xmath38 one has @xmath41 the least constant @xmath39 for which this holds is called the _ @xmath0-summing norm _ of @xmath17 , notation @xmath42 .",
