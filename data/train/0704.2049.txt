    "there is currently a great deal of interest in collective quantum effects in plasmas @xcite ; many of these studies are motivated by recent experimental progress and techniques @xcite and also by possible astrophysical applications @xcite .",
    "in particular , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) plasmas are of interest in such astrophysical applications . however ,",
    "in strong magnetic fields , single electron effects that depend on the electron spin properties , such as landau quantization , will be important .",
    "it is thus not surprising that collective spin effects can influence the wave propagation in a strongly magnetized quantum plasma @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent progress in producing ultra - cold plasmas in terms of rydberg states @xcite may offer an interesting experimental environment for quantum plasma dynamics . in such cold plasmas , the thermal energy of the particles can be very small compared to the zeeman energy of the particles in an magnetic fields .",
    "thus , collective spin properties of quantum plasmas may be possible to detect in a near future .    in this brief report",

    "we show that in a magnetized quantum plasma , the electron spin-@xmath0 effect can strongly modify the amplitude and width of rarefactive solitons .",
    "we begin by presenting the general governing equations for a quantum magnetoplasma in which the electron@xmath1 spin effect are included .",

    ", we immediately obtain the continuity equation    @xmath12    assuming the quasi - neutrality , i.e.  @xmath13 , the momentum conservation equation reads    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the scalar pressure in the center - of - mass frame , the current is given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the plasma magnetization due to the electron spin , and @xcite    @xmath18    is the quantum force due to collective tunneling and spin alignment . here @xmath19 is the magnitude of the bohr magneton , @xmath20 is planck constant divided by @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the speed of light in vacuum .",

    "the solitary waves have only sub - alfvnic speeds and are characterized by a localized depletion of the magnetic field and density . in fig . 1 , we see that the solitary waves increase their amplitudes for smaller speeds . in the limit of zero speed",
    ", we have rarefactive solitons with a zero density at its center .",
    "the influence of the electron spin-@xmath0 effect on the solitary waves is displayed in fig .",
    "2 , where we see that larger values of @xmath63 lead to wider solitary waves with shallower density and magnetic field depletions . in order to study the influence of the spin pressure on the nonlinear dynamics of our system ,",

    "in the numerical examples of the previous section , the normalized zeeman energy @xmath63 played a crucial role .",
    "in particular , the spin contribution to the soliton dynamics is enhanced when the zeeman energy is of the order of or greater than one ( we note however that other parameters play a role in forming the necessary shape of the sagdeev potential ) .",
    "thus , it is natural to investigate what type of parameter values correspond to @xmath79 . for astrophysical plasmas , such as in pulsar magnetospheres , we can have @xmath80 @xcite , implying that the that @xmath79 for @xmath81 , i.e. , not a very severe constraint . however , in such environments , the plasma often has relativistic temperatures and flows , and a relativistic formalism should be used . in the case of rydberg plasmas",
    "@xcite , where the temperature can go as low as millikelvins , we see that the zeeman energy is greater than one for external magnetic field @xmath82 .",
    "thus , in such ultra - cold laboratory systems , a very weak external magnetic field would make spin effects important for the formation of solitons , and the theory presented here could therefore be checked experimentally .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the effects of the quantum bohm potential and the electron spin-@xmath0 on the existence of magnetosonic solitary waves in a magnetized quantum plasma .",
    "the solitary waves exist due to a balance between the nonlinearities and the dispersion induced by the electron quantum diffraction / tunneling effects associated with the quantum bohm potential .",
    "the spin introduces an additional negative pressure - like term in the quantum momentum equation , with the effect that solitary waves become wider and have shallower density depletions for larger values of the zeeman energy @xmath83 .",
    "we note that the spin term in the sagdeev potential ( 13 ) can dominate the dynamics in the regime of @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "this regime corresponds to a dense quantum plasma with an ambient magnetic field , such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the spin of the electrons collectively modifies the quantum dynamics of the mhd plasma significantly ."
