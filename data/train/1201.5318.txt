    "heavy - ion reactions at radioactive ion beam ( rib ) facilities enable us to synthesize new exotic neutron - rich nuclei far away from the valley of stability and to study their physical properties . at the hribf facility",
    "a series of experiments has been carried out with radioactive @xmath0sn beams on various targets  @xcite .",
    "one of the major open questions in fusion reactions of exotic neutron - rich nuclei is the dependence of the fusion cross section ( and related observables ) on the neutron excess , or equivalently on the total isospin quantum number @xmath4 . to reveal possible systematic trends requires both theoretical and experimental studies with a wide variety of projectile and target combinations which are expected to become available at current and future rib facilities . to be able to pin down the isospin dependence in a fully microscopic theory ,",
    "it is desirable to choose collision partners which are as simple as possible : projectile and target nuclei should be spherical in their ground state , and the compound nucleus should have a high fission barrier so that the fission component can be ignored ( at least at lower beam energies ) .",
    "ideal reaction partners satisfying these criteria include the neutron - rich system @xmath0sn+@xmath1ca and the stable system @xmath2sn+@xmath3ca which we investigate in this paper .",
    "if the reaction partners have appreciably different @xmath5 ratios , the proton and neutron centers of mass of the reacting system may not coincide during the early stages of the collision . in this case",
    ", collective oscillations of protons against neutrons on the way to fusion might occur , the so - called pre - equilibrium giant dipole resonance ( gdr )  @xcite . in fusion reactions , the shape of the pre - equilibrium di - nuclear complex exhibits a very large prolate deformation as compared to the shape of the equilibrated compound nucleus ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "consequently , the @xmath6-rays emitted during the early phase of fusion contain information about the shape of the system and provide a cooling effect along the fusion path as well as insight into the charge equilibration .",
    "the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory provides a useful foundation for a fully microscopic many - body theory of large amplitude collective motion  @xcite including nuclear molecular resonances , deep - inelastic scattering and heavy - ion fusion , and collective excitations .",
    "the earliest tdhf calculations carried out in the 1970 s and 1980 s were severely limited by computer memory and speed .",
    "hence , these calculations had to make restrictive assumptions such as axial symmetry and the omission of spin - orbit coupling . during the past several years , with a steady increase in computational power , it has become feasible to perform tdhf calculations on a three - dimensional ( 3d ) cartesian grid with no symmetry restrictions whatsoever and with much more accurate numerical methods  @xcite . at the same time",
    "the quality of effective interactions has also been substantially improved  @xcite .",
    "our tdhf code utilizes the full skyrme interaction , including all of the time - odd terms in the mean - field hamiltonian  @xcite .    during the past several years",
    ", we have developed the density - constrained tdhf method ( dc - tdhf ) for calculating heavy - ion potentials  @xcite , and we have applied this method to calculate fusion and capture cross sections above and below the barrier .",
    "so far , we have studied the systems @xmath0sn+@xmath7ni  @xcite , @xmath7ni+@xmath7ni  @xcite , @xmath8o+@xmath9pb  @xcite , @xmath10sn+@xmath11zr  @xcite , and we have studied the entrance channel dynamics of hot and cold fusion reactions leading to superheavy element @xmath12  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "we have found good agreement between the measured fusion cross sections and the dc - tdhf results .",
    "this is rather remarkable given the fact that the only input in dc - tdhf is the skyrme effective n - n interaction , and there are no adjustable parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  ii we summarize the theoretical formalism for pre - equilibrium gdr excitation in heavy - ion fusion reactions with the tdhf method , and we compare the resulting dipole radiation yields for the neutron - rich system @xmath0sn+@xmath1ca to the photon spectra of the stable system @xmath2sn+@xmath3ca . in section  iii , we study total fusion cross sections for both systems .",
    "first , we carry out unrestricted tdhf runs at energies above the barrier ( no tunneling ) .",
    "secondly , we calculate the heavy - ion interaction potential @xmath13 and the coordinate - dependent mass parameter @xmath14 utilizing the dc - tdhf method . by numerical integration of the schrdinger equation for the relative coordinate @xmath15 with the _ incoming wave boundary condition _ ( iwbc ) method , we calculate total fusion cross sections both below and above the barrier , and we compare our theoretical results to recent data measured at hribf .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  iv .",
    "in the present tdhf calculations we use the skyrme sly4 interaction  @xcite for the nucleons including all of the time - odd terms in the mean - field hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations are carried out on a 3d cartesian lattice .",
    "for the two reactions studied here , the lattice spans @xmath16  fm along the collision axis and @xmath17  fm in the other two directions , depending on the impact parameter .",
    "derivative operators on the lattice are represented by the basis - spline collocation method .",
    "one of the major advantages of this method is that we may use a relatively large grid spacing of @xmath18  fm and nevertheless achieve high numerical accuracy .",
    "first we generate very accurate static hf wave functions for the two nuclei on the 3d grid .",
    "the static hf equations are solved with the damped gradient iteration method .",
    "the initial separation of the two nuclei is @xmath19  fm for central collisions . in the second step ,",
    "we apply a boost operator to the single - particle wave functions .",
    "the time - propagation is carried out using a taylor series expansion ( up to orders @xmath20 ) of the unitary mean - field propagator , with a time step @xmath21  fm / c .    in tdhf , the dissipation of the relative kinetic energy into internal excitations is due to the collisions of the nucleons with the `` walls '' of the self - consistent mean - field potential  @xcite . because the randomization of the single - particle motion occurs through repeated exchange of nucleons from one nucleus into the other ,",
    "the equilibration of excitations is rather slow , and it is sensitive to the details of the shape evolution of the composite system .",
    "this is in contrast to most classical pictures of nuclear fusion which generally assume near instantaneous , isotropic equilibration .    in fig .",

    "the initial amplitude seems to be nearly the same in both cases which may question the argument that the total isospin @xmath36 is responsible for the strong dipole excitations .",
    "we have also computed a collision of the symmetric system @xmath37sr+@xmath37sr which ends in a comparable compound state .",
    "there is no isovector dipole excitation in this case as expected .",

    "we have cut out the approach phase of the two ions corresponding to times @xmath46  fm / c .",
    "the upper limit of the time integration is @xmath47  fm / c which corresponds to @xmath48 s.    the lower part ( red curve ) of the fig .",
    "[ fig : d10_e ] shows the spectrum obtained for the whole time interval @xmath49  fm / c .",
    "we observe that the isovector dipole radiation spectrum shows a peak near @xmath50  mev for both isotopic combinations .",
    "furthermore , we have also divided the total time span into three intervals and evaluated the power spectra separately for these ( see upper panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : d10_e ] .",
    "this indicates the time evolution of the power spectra .",
    "the case of @xmath0sn+@xmath1ca shows a steady upshift of the mean peak and decrease of overall strength .",
    "the latter is an obvious effect of damping .",
    "the upshift indicates a decreasing system size .",
    "this complies with the expectation that the true system radii ( evaluated in an analyzing volume ) should shrink .",
    "the system @xmath2sn+@xmath3ca behaves differently .",

    ", one can conclude that the system with a larger initial @xmath5 differential , namely the stable system , should have the stronger initial pre - equilibrium gdr excitation , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : d10_e ] this is indeed the case . on the other hand",
    "the presence of extra neutrons for the neutron - rich system seem to prolong the life of the gdr suggesting a longer equilibration time for this case .",
    "we have also evaluated the dipole radiation spectra originating from the compound systems in their ground states . both of these have a quadrupole deformation @xmath55 which is significantly smaller than the deformation of the pre - compound state , @xmath56 .",
    "figure  [ fig : d10_e ] ( lower panels , dashed black curves ) shows also the power spectra produced by the compound systems . because of the smaller deformation the spectra peak at a higher energy , and this peak",
    "is well separated from the peak of pre - compound stage .    in order to estimate the energy content in the isovector - dipole oscillations ,",
    "we have computed the dipole polarizability @xmath57 and find for the pre - compound system @xmath58 the value @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding excitation energy is given by @xmath61 .",
    "this energy content changes based on what stage of the reaction is considered . during the initial contact phase , where the dipole excitation may be the dominant form of collective excitation the",
    "amplitude @xmath62 ( see figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) is as large as @xmath63  fm , which yields @xmath64  mev excitation whereas at later stages the dipole amplitude is in the range of @xmath65  fm resulting in approximately @xmath66  mev excitation .",
    "our calculations of excitation energy based on the dc - tdhf method ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for this c.m .",
    "energy indicate that the amount of intrinsic excitation energy starts to rise from zero as the two nuclei make contact and reach the value of @xmath67  mev as the initial composite system is formed .",
    "thus the fraction of the excitation energy carried by the pre - equilibrium gdr can be a large part of the small excitation energy near barrier ( by as much as @xmath67% at the barrier peak ) , while it becomes less than a percent in the interior region .",
    "depending upon beam energy and impact parameter , the dominant reaction channels are deep - inelastic and fusion reactions  @xcite . in general , central collisions and collisions with relatively small impact parameter result in fusion , while larger impact parameters give rise to deep - inelastic reactions . at @xmath68 energies above the potential barrier it is possible to carry out standard unrestricted tdhf runs ( no tunneling ) . by varying the impact parameter and plotting the density contours as a function of time",
    ", one can easily distinguish between fusion events ( one fragment in the exit channel ) and deep - inelastic reactions ( two fragments ) .",
    "let us first consider the case of the neutron - rich system @xmath0sn+@xmath1ca .",
    "the hf initialization run shows that both nuclei are spherical in their ground state , in agreement with hfb calculations and with experimental data . at energy @xmath69",

    "the unphysical shape is due to the lack of pairing in pure hf .",
    "because the shape of the nucleus is very important for fusion calculations , we have added bcs / lipkin - nogami pairing to the hf initialization of @xmath2sn which results in an approximately spherical shape . during the subsequent tdhf run",

    "we notice that if we plot both systems as a function of the center - of - mass energy , the more massive neutron - rich system shows a larger fusion cross section .",
    "part of this is a trivial size - effect which can be taking out by appropriate scaling factors .",
    "we will comment on this issue further when we compare the tdhf cross sections to experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_scaled ] at the end of section iii ) .      in the absence of a true quantum many - body theory of barrier tunneling ,",
    "sub - barrier fusion calculations are reduced to the calculation of a potential barrier between the interacting nuclei and a subsequent calculation of tunneling through the barrier  @xcite . to date , theoretical studies of fusion cross sections are still dominated by phenomenological methods such as the coupled - channels ( cc ) approach  @xcite . in this approach , one either uses empirical ion - ion potentials or one calculates the heavy - ion potential with the double - folding method using measured nuclear densities for projectile and target  @xcite . in the latter case , one relies on the `` frozen density '' or `` sudden '' approximation in which the nuclear densities are unchanged during the computation of the ion - ion potential as a function of the internuclear distance . the frozen density approximation ignores dynamical effects such as neck formation during the nuclear overlap .",
    "it has been demonstrated that for deep sub - barrier energies the inner part of the potential barrier plays a very important role  @xcite .    while phenomenological methods provide a useful starting point for the analysis of multitudinous fusion data it is desirable to make contact with the microscopic theories of nuclear structure and reactions .",

    "the numerical calculations are carried out on a 3d lattice using both the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) method and the recently developed density constrained tdhf method ( dc - tdhf ) .",
    "regarding pre - equilibrium gdr excitation , we demonstrate that the peak of the dipole radiation spectrum occurs at a substantially lower energy than expected for an equilibrated system , thus reflecting the very large prolate elongation of the di - nuclear complex during the early stages of fusion .",
    "in addition , we study total fusion cross sections for both systems .",
    "first , we carry out unrestricted tdhf runs at energies above the barrier ( no tunneling ) . secondly , we calculate the heavy - ion interaction potential @xmath13 and the coordinate - dependent mass parameter @xmath14 utilizing the dc - tdhf method .",
    "our results demonstrate that in these heavy systems the potential barrier height increases dramatically with increasing energy @xmath77 , and the barrier peak moves inward towards smaller @xmath15-values , in contrast to light ion systems such as @xmath8o+@xmath8o which show almost no energy - dependence .    by numerical integration of the schrdinger equation for the relative coordinate @xmath15 with the _ incoming wave boundary condition _ ( iwbc )",
    "method , we calculate total fusion cross sections both below and above the barrier .",
    "we emphasize that the only input in our microscopic calculations is the skyrme n - n interaction , with no adjustable parameters whatsoever .",
    "we find that our theoretical fusion cross sections for both systems agree reasonably well with recent data measured at hribf .",
