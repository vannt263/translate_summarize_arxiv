    "discrete symmetries , such as parity ( p ) , charge conjugation ( c ) and time - reversal ( t ) , have played important roles to establish the structure of the standard model .",
    "one of the most famous examples is cp violation which led to three generations of quarks and leptons@xcite .    in the strong interaction ,",
    "the most strict constraint on violation of p and t symmetries comes from the measurement of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) for neutron ( nedm ) and proton ( pedm ) .",
    "the current upper bound is given by @xmath5 for neutron from a larmor frequency measurement with ultra - cold neutron ( ucn)@xcite , and @xmath6 for proton@xcite , which is estimated indirectly from edm of mercury atom @xmath7 given by @xmath8@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , qcd allows a gauge invariant , renormalizable , and cp odd @xmath0 term , @xmath9 in euclidean space - time with @xmath10 which is the field strength of gluon . some model estimations@xcite yield @xmath11 which leads to a bound @xmath12",
    ". hence @xmath0 must be very small or even may vanish in qcd .",
    "smallness of @xmath0 in the qcd sector , however , is not protected in the presence of the electroweak sector of the standard model , where the quark mass matrix , arising from yukawa couplings to the higgs field , may be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent left and right handed quark fields with flavor indices @xmath16 .",
    "diagonalizing the mass matrix and making it real , the parameter @xmath0 becomes @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the original @xmath0 parameter in qcd .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 and @xmath19 contributions have to cancel out to the precise degree that the stringent experimental upper bound on nedm is satisfied . in either of the two cases",
    ", it seems necessary to explain why nature chooses such a small value for @xmath0 ; this is the `` strong cp problem '' .",
    "one of the most attractive explanations proposed so far is the peccei - quinn mechanism@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the axion , a new particle predicted by this mechanism , has not been experimentally observed so far .",
    "present theoretical estimations of nedm vary in magnitude among different models such as current algebra@xcite , chiral perturbation theory@xcite , and qcd sum rule@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "while these crude estimations of @xmath20 already convince the smallness of @xmath0 , a theoretically reliable and accurate estimation for nedm will be required to determine the value of @xmath0 , if a non - zero value of nedm is observed in future experiments .",
    "lattice qcd calculations provide a first - principle method for this task .",
    "indeed more than fifteen years ago , the first attempt was made to estimate nedm in a quenched lattice qcd simulation@xcite .",
    "reliable signal of nedm could not be obtained at this time@xcite . since then",
    ", no lattice calculation of nedm have been attempted until recently . in the last year , new approach has been presented for this problem .",
    "ref.@xcite proposed a formulation to extract the cp - odd electromagnetic form factor of nucleon from certain lattice correlation functions .",
    "nedm can be extracted from this form factor in the zero momentum transfer limit . applying this formulation in a quenched calculation with domain - wall quarks , a non - zero value for the cp - odd form factor of nucleon",
    "was obtained at one value of non - zero momentum .",
    "based on this formulation , the same form factor has been calculated on gauge configurations generated by @xmath21 dynamical domain - wall qcd at several non - zero momenta@xcite . the value of nedm after the zero momentum extrapolation , however , is consistent with zero within the large statistical error in this calculation .",
    "the results mentioned above suggest that , while it is possible to obtain signals for the cp odd form factor at fixed and small value of momentum , it is numerically difficult to carry out a statistically controlled extrapolation of the form factor to the zero momentum limit to extract the value of edm . therefore , in this paper , we investigate another method to calculate the value of edm directly without momentum extrapolation . in this method , introducing a constant uniform electric field @xmath22 , we measure the energy difference between spin - up and spin - down components of the nucleon in the presence of the @xmath0 term  @xcite . if the electric field is small enough , the leading contribution to the energy difference is given by @xmath23 with neutron spin @xmath24 and electric field @xmath22 .",
    "therefore edm can be directly extracted without momentum extrapolation .",
    "the most difficult part of this calculation is to reweight the nucleon propagator on a given gauge configuration with the factor @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the topological charge of the configuration .",
    "we may control this reweighting by taking a small value of @xmath0 .",
    "another difficulty is that our electric field breaks periodicity in the time direction , generating large field at the time boundary .",
    "we should investigate influences of the large electric field at the boundary to edm signals .",
    "we check the ability of this method in the quenched approximation at a heavy quark mass .",
    "we employ two fermion formulations , domain - wall fermion having chiral symmetry and clover fermion with explicitly broken chiral symmetry , in order to investigate possible dependence of edm signals on the aspect of chiral symmetry of fermion formulations .",
    "our study have revealed that the quality of edm signals is not very sensitive to fermion formulations .",
    "therefore we have employed the clover fermion , which requires much less computational cost than the domain - wall fermion , to study various systematics of edm such as the volume dependence , the boundary effect and the quark mass dependence within the quenched approximation .",

    "[ sec : nedm_e_field ] we explain the definition of edm and our method to extract edm from nucleon propagators .",
    "simulation details of our lattice calculation are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result_efield ] we show numerical results with both domain - wall and clover fermion at heavy quark mass on a @xmath1 lattice .",
    "we then investigate the finite size effect and the boundary effect on a @xmath4 lattice with the clover fermion .",
    "in [ sec : quark_mass_dep ] we systematically study the quark mass dependence of edm using the larger lattice with the clover fermion .",
    "a summary and discussion is given in the last section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in our previous work@xcite , we defined nedm from the cp - odd electromagnetic form factor , @xmath27 , in the zero momentum transfer limit . in the actual calculation , however , it is not so easy to change the momentum transfer , since the momentum is quantized as @xmath28 on a finite spatial length of @xmath29 . in the case of large @xmath30 with @xmath31 at small @xmath29 ,",
    "statistical errors are large , while a smaller @xmath30 with @xmath31 , which has a better signal , requires a larger lattice size @xmath29 . in both cases ,",
    "the calculation becomes more difficult for larger momentum at @xmath32 than for the smallest momentum at @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , the correct distribution of the topological charge is essentially important for the nedm calculation .",
    "since the width of the distribution of topological charge increases linearly with the volume , larger volume calculations require more statistics than the small volume ones , contrary to other observables .",
    "the difficulties for the extrapolation to the zero momentum transfer limit mentioned above are our motivations to consider a different method for the nedm calculation with which we can avoid the momentum extrapolation . in this section",
    "we introduce our new approach for the lattice qcd calculation of nedm .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , nedm is defined through the energy change of the neutron state in the presence of an external electric field , similarly to the magnetic moment defined from that in the magnetic field .",
    "if a static and uniform electric field exists in a cp - violating system , the electric dipole moment(edm ) appears in the hamiltonian as the interaction term between spin @xmath24 of particle and electric field @xmath22 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the edm . in order to extract edm",
    "we consider the energy difference of nucleon states for opposite spins in the external electric field : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the energy of nucleon whose spin vector is @xmath38 in the presence of the electric field @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we can extract @xmath35 from the nucleon propagators for two different spin states at zero momentum only , avoiding difficult calculations at non - zero momenta .    for small @xmath0 we can expand @xmath35 as @xmath40",
    "we will check that higher order contributions at @xmath41 are negligibly small .",
    "hereafter we represent @xmath42 as the leading order of edm .      a static and uniform electric field",
    "is represented by the spatial gauge potential as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the constant electric field in euclidean space .",
    "a non - zero nedm could be detected from the oscillating behavior of the neutron propagator .",
    "since nedm is expected to be small , it is numerically very difficult to measure such a small oscillation . on the other hand , if we employ a static and uniform electric field in minkovski space as @xmath45 the oscillation turns into an exponential behavior , which is easier to measure .",
    "therefore we introduce a static and uniform electric field in minkovski space as an external field into lattice qcd , by replacing the spatial link variables as @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the quark charge , @xmath48 for up quark and @xmath49 for down quark .",
    "hereafter we suppress the superscript of the constant electric field @xmath50 in minkovski space for simplicity .",
    "an obvious problem here is that the minkovski electric field @xmath51 breaks the periodic boundary condition in the temporal direction : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the size of the temporal direction .",
    "this generates an effective electric field , defined by @xmath54 , as @xmath55 therefore the electric field is no more constant near the boundary between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in order to avoid the effect of this non - uniform electric field to the edm signal",
    ", we have to take @xmath50 as small as possible . in any case a small value of @xmath50 is necessary to neglect @xmath58 terms in ( [ eq : edm_hamil ] ) . also breaks the periodic boundary condition . ]    in our calculation gauge configurations are generated by the usual lattice qcd action without @xmath51 and @xmath0 .",
    "after inserting the electric field to gauge configurations we calculate quark propagators for flavor @xmath59 and @xmath60 separately , in addition to the normal one with @xmath61 , which is used to remove a fake signal at @xmath62 caused by statistical fluctuations .",
    "the total number of solvers for quark propagators is three for each configuration . from quark propagators we construct the nucleon propagator with the @xmath0 term as @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the vacuum expectation value of @xmath65 with @xmath22 but without the @xmath0 term .",
    "here we use the re - weighting method with the complex weight factor @xmath25 . in order to obtain good signals , a large overlap of gauge ensembles between @xmath66 and @xmath67 as well as the correct distribution of the topological charge",
    "are required .",
