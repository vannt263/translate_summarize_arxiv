    "term  ( iii ) for  @xmath237 gives terms  ( iii ) , ( iv ) , and  ( v ) for  @xmath5 .",

    "the contracted component of genus  @xmath66 contains either  0 or  1 point with markings @xmath527 ( those that are not forgotten by  @xmath525 ) . according to these two cases",
    "we obtain either term  ( iv ) or term  ( v ) from the proposition .      by the action of the upper triangular group",
    "we have obtained a gromov  witten potential that describes the semi - simple frobenius manifold  @xmath59 that we started with .",

    "this annoying term leads to a problem that we have to discuss in more detail .",
    "the corresponding term @xmath542 in the differential operator @xmath543 is simply a partial derivative in the direction @xmath544 .",
    "the exponential @xmath545 is then a shift of the coordinates @xmath64 in this direction .",
    "a shift of coordinates is not a well - defined operation for formal power series . in our case",
    ", we consider power series in variables @xmath546 , @xmath547 ,  , whose coefficients are analytic in @xmath64 on the frobenius manifold except perhaps its discriminant .",
    "thus the shift is a well - defined operation , but it can , in some cases , lead us out of the realm of power series . in this case the genus expansion of the genus  0 gromov ",
    "witten potential will be a power series in @xmath546 , @xmath547 ,  , whose coefficients are analytic functions in @xmath64 with a singularity at the origin .",
    "( see , for instance ,  @xcite , section  6 , where @xmath78 and @xmath156 are the gromov ",
    "witten potentials without descendants for genus @xmath66 and  @xmath55 respectively . )",
