    "<S> is often conducted , wherein only the promising discoveries are followed - up . </S>",
    "<S> this is a common research strategy in genomics , proteomics and in other areas where high throughput methods are used . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to decide whether promising findings from the preliminary study are replicated by the follow - up study , keeping in mind that the preliminary study involved an extensive search for rare true signal in a vast amount of noise . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal computes a number , the @xmath0-value , to quantify the strength of replication . _    </S>",
    "<S> we are concerned with situations in which many features are scanned for their statistical significance in a primary study . </S>",
    "<S> these features can be single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) examined for associations with disease , genes examined for differential expression , pathways examined for enrichment , protein pairs examined for protein - protein interactions , etc . </S>",
    "<S> interesting features are selected for follow - up , and only the selected ones are tested in a follow - up study .    </S>",
    "<S> this approach addresses two goals . </S>",
    "<S> the first goal is to increase the number of cases in order to increase the power to detect a feature , at a lower cost . </S>",
    "<S> the second goal is to address the basic dogma of science that a finding is more convincingly a true finding if it is replicated in at least one more study . </S>",
    "<S> replicability has been the cornerstone of science as we know it since the foundation of experimental science . </S>",
    "<S> possibly the first documented example is the discovery of a phenomenon related to vacuum , made by huygens in amsterdam in the 17th century , who travelled to boyle s laboratory in london in order to replicate the experiment and prove that the scientific phenomenon was not idiosynchronic to his specific laboratory with his specific equipment @xcite . in modern research , </S>",
    "<S> the lack of replicability has deeply bothered behavioral scientists that compare the behavior of different strains of mice , e.g. in knockout experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is well documented that in different laboratories , the comparison of behaviors of the same two strains may lead to opposite conclusions that are both statistically significant ( @xcite , @xcite , and chapter 4 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation may be the different laboratory environment ( i.e. personnel , equipment , measurement techniques ) affecting differently the study strains ( i.e. an interaction of strain with laboratory ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the null hypothesis that the effect is say non - positive is true in one laboratory , but false in the other laboratory , and thus the positive effect is not replicated in both laboratories . </S>",
    "<S> replicability problems also emerge in medical research and are of great concern . </S>",
    "<S> half of phase iii clinical trials fail even though they rely on one of the many measures of success that were studied in the phase ii trials ( @xcite and @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the therapeutic effect discovered in the phase ii study , which leads to the phase iii study conducted in different patients , using similar but not identical methods and measures of success , was not replicated . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the phase iii studies were not under - powered , so failing to discover an effect suggests that the effect was absent from phase iii even if it was present in phase ii . in genomic research , </S>",
    "<S> the interest is in the genetic effect on phenotype . in different studies of the same associations with phenotype </S>",
    "<S> , we seem to be testing the same hypotheses but the hypotheses tested are actually much more particular . </S>",
    "<S> whether a hypothesis is true may depend on the cohorts in the study , that are from specific populations exposed to specific environments ( for particular examples , see section results ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if discoveries are made , it is of great interest to see whether these discoveries are replicated in different cohorts , from different populations , with different environmental exposures and different measurement techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the paramount importance of having replicated findings is well recognized in genomic research @xcite . in particular , this is so in genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) , see @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as noted in @xcite , the anticipated effects for common variants in gwas are modest and very similar in magnitude to the subtle biases that may affect genetic association studies - most notably population stratification bias . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , they argue that it is important to observe the same association in other studies using similar , but not identical , sub - populations and methods . obviously , </S>",
    "<S> splitting the data into two independent parts and doing the same analysis on each does not answer the above concerns .    </S>",
    "<S> replicability problems arise in many additional scientific areas , and discussions of these problems reached prominent general - interest venues , for instance the new yorker ( december 13 , 2010 ) and the economist ( october 19 , 2013 ) . we need to have an objective way to declare that a certain study really replicates the findings in another study . </S>",
    "<S> this paper makes a concrete , objective , easy to apply , and rigorously motivated way to determine that a finding has been replicated .    </S>",
    "<S> * replicability versus meta - analysis . * in many areas </S>",
    "<S> it is common to combine the results of studies that examine the same hypotheses by a meta - analysis . </S>",
    "<S> pooling results across studies is especially attractive when single studies are underpowered , utilizing the potential increase in power of combining the studies , but the meta - analysis @xmath1-value tests only the null hypothesis of no signal in all studies . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> a strong signal in one of the studies ( with @xmath1-value close to zero ) is enough to declare the meta - analysis finding as highly significant .    </S>",
    "<S> a meta - analysis discovery based on a few studies is no better than a discovery from a single large study in assessing replicability , unless we are ready to assume that if a signal exists in one study it exists in all , i.e. that a discovery has to be a replicated discovery . </S>",
    "<S> this obviously need not be true , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , replicability can not be assessed in the following common practice : features are screened in a primary study , then the features with promising results are examined in a follow - up study , and the discoveries are only based on the results from the follow - up study . </S>",
    "<S> these are follow - up study discoveries , not discoveries that replicated from the primary study to the follow - up study .    in gwas , a typical table of results reports the @xmath1-values in the primary and follow - up study , side by side , as well as the meta - analysis @xmath1-values , for the snps with the smallest meta - analysis @xmath1-values . </S>",
    "<S> table 1 columns 1 - 6 is an example of such a table of results @xcite . in replicability analysis , </S>",
    "<S> the null hypothesis of signal in at most one study is tested , the rejection of which yields the statistical significance of the replicability claim . </S>",
    "<S> ( replicability is sometimes referred to as reproducibility , but see @xcite . )    * the @xmath0-value for replicability . * </S>",
    "<S> if a hypothesis in one study is rejected at the 0.05 level , and it is also rejected in the same direction in another study at the 0.05 level , then replicability is intuitively established . </S>",
    "<S> this is also a sound statistical claim , in the sense that the probability of claiming that a finding is replicated if the null hypothesis is true in at least one of the studies is at most 0.05 . </S>",
    "<S> the need for a statistical framework for establishing replicability becomes essential with the use of high throughput methods . </S>",
    "<S> the potential to err in inference when more than one study is involved is more severe when each study is examining simultaneously many features . </S>",
    "<S> the choices for selection are much wider </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , the statistical methods needed are more complicated than the very intuitive statistical method for establishing replicability when a single feature is involved . </S>",
    "<S> multiple testing methods are widely employed to adjust for the effect of selection , either by controlling the probability of erroneously selecting even a single feature ( fwer ) , or by controlling the false discovery rate ( fdr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the concern regarding the selected claims of replicability is even greater , because the selection takes place both after the primary study and after the follow - up study . </S>",
    "<S> our method reports the _ r - value _ , that can be defined for either error rates for replicability analysis . here </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the fdr : + * definition.*_the fdr @xmath0-value for feature @xmath2 is the lowest fdr level at which we can say that the finding is among the replicated ones . _ + the smaller the @xmath0-value , the stronger the evidence in favor of replicability of the finding . </S>",
    "<S> it can be compared to any desired level of fdr in the same way that a @xmath1-value is commonly compared to the desired false detection parameter @xmath3 .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a method for computing @xmath0-values for features examined in primary and follow - up studies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest to complement tables of results that report for selected findings the primary , follow - up , and meta - analysis @xmath1-values , with an additional column of @xmath0-values . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-values in column 7 of table 1 are all below 0.05 , concurring with the main replicability findings of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ranking of @xmath0-values is different than the ranking of the meta - analysis @xmath1-values , indicating the novelty of the added information . </S>",
    "<S> table 2 shows the results of a somewhat more complicated example to be discussed below , where the difference between the meta - analysis and the replicability conclusions is more dramatic . </S>"
