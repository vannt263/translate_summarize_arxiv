    "the chromatic number and independence ratio are equal or almost equal . on the other hand , so - called _ kneser graphs _ are examples of graphs on @xmath7 vertices with constant independent ratio and chromatic number of order @xmath8  @xcite . in this paper , we are motivated by three conjectures on cycles in graphs with large chromatic number .",

    "the important result by kim  @xcite establishing the order of magnitude of triangle - complete graph ramsey numbers @xmath16 shows that there are triangle - free graphs with independence ratio @xmath9 and with @xmath17 vertices , so the above result is best possible up to the value of the implicit constant .",

    "then we say that @xmath18 has _ speed at most @xmath20 _ if for every @xmath21 and every @xmath7-vertex graph @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 . since the identity function @xmath24 for @xmath25 serves as an upper bound for the speed of every hereditary property , the speed of each hereditary property is well - defined .",

    "theorem [ general ] applies in general to the property @xmath28 of @xmath29-free graphs  this is the hereditary property of graphs which do not contain any copy of @xmath29 .",

    "one can improve the lower bound @xmath33 in the above theorem by a polylogarithmic factor which , for @xmath34 , agrees with theorem [ long ] , but this involves only further computations and so will be omitted .",
    "erds  @xcite offered one thousand dollars for a satisfactory resolution of the following problem : in a graph of infinite chromatic number , which cycle lengths should appear ?",
    "for example , erds conjectured that a graph of sufficiently large chromatic number has a cycle of length a prime .",
    "we show that if an @xmath7-vertex graph has independence ratio at least @xmath35 , then not only does it contain a cycle of prime length , it contains cycles of lengths from many other sparse infinite sequences of integers . here",
    "@xmath36 is the number of times the natural logarithm must be applied to @xmath7 to get a number less than one , and in what follows , we write @xmath37 for the logarithm base @xmath38 , and omit the base if the logarithm is the natural logarithm .",
    "we prove the following theorem :    [ lengths ] let @xmath39 be an infinite increasing sequence of positive integers satisfying @xmath40 and @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath0 is an @xmath7-vertex graph and @xmath43 then @xmath0 contains a cycle of length in the sequence @xmath39 .",
    "theorem [ lengths ] is proved in section 3 .",
    "we claimed that an @xmath7-vertex graph @xmath0 with @xmath44 contains a cycle of length a prime .",

    "an important remark is that theorem [ lengths ] distinguishes between the independence ratio and the chromatic number : generalizations of mycielski s well - known construction of triangle - free graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number provide constructions for infinitely many @xmath7 of an @xmath7-vertex graph @xmath52 of chromatic number @xmath53 with no cycle of length in a prescribed sequence @xmath39 satisfying @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",

    "erds  @xcite proposed the study of the quantity @xmath56 and conjectured that in a graph of infinite chromatic number , @xmath57 diverges .",
    "this conjecture was proved by gyrfs , komlos and szemerdi  @xcite .",
    "specifically , they proved that if @xmath0 is a finite graph of minimum degree @xmath58 , then there exists @xmath59 such that @xmath60 this is best possible up to the value of the constant @xmath61 , since the complete bipartite graph has @xmath62 .",
    "it follows that @xmath57 diverges when @xmath0 has infinite chromatic number , since a graph of infinite chromatic number contains a graph of minimum degree at least @xmath58 for each @xmath63 .",
    "the result above therefore does not rely on the chromatic number as much as the existence of subgraphs of arbitrarily large average degree .",
    "erds and hajnal  @xcite conjectured that in a graph with infinite chromatic number , the sum of reciprocals of odd cycle lengths diverges .",
    "if @xmath64 is the set of lengths of odd cycles in @xmath0 , their conjecture states that if @xmath0 is a graph of infinite chromatic number , then @xmath65 in this paper , we give some evidence for this conjecture by showing :    [ recip ] for any graph @xmath0 on @xmath7 vertices , @xmath66    we prove theorem [ recip ] in section 4 .",
    "this theorem is best possible up to the @xmath67 term , in the sense that @xmath68 .",
    "it would be interesting as a first step to the erds - hajnal conjecture to show that @xmath69 diverges when @xmath0 is a graph with infinite independence ratio .",
    "in this section , we present the results necessary for the proofs of theorems [ long][recip ] .",
    "the following notation will be used .",

    "we denote by @xmath72 the set of vertices of @xmath73 adjacent to at least one vertex in @xmath3 .",
    "we sometimes omit the subscript @xmath0 when it is clear which graph is being referred to .",
    "we write @xmath2 for the independence number of the subgraph of @xmath0 induced by @xmath3 . fixing a vertex @xmath74 ,",
    "it is convenient to let @xmath75 denote the set of vertices at distance exactly @xmath76 from @xmath77 .",
    "the starting point for proving theorems [ long ]  [ lengths ] is to show that graphs with large independence ratio have nice expansion properties .",
    "precisely , we make the following definitions :    we say that a graph @xmath0 is _ @xmath9-expanding on independent sets _ if every independent set @xmath78 in @xmath0 has @xmath79 . a graph @xmath0 is _ weakly @xmath9-expanding on independent sets _ if for some @xmath74 , every independent set @xmath80 has @xmath79 .",
    "we notice in particular that if a graph is weakly @xmath9-expanding on independent sets , then all but at most one vertex in the graph has degree more than @xmath9 .",

    "therefore there exists @xmath97 that is @xmath9-expanding on independent sets .",
