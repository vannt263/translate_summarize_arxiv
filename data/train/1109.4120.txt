    "the decomposition of the calculated @xmath145 and @xmath145 spectra into separate transitions revealed that the cu@xmath2 3@xmath151 orbitals serve as _ initial _ states for transitions within the spectral range 2.4@xmath373.5 ev in fig .",
    "final _ states involved are of cu@xmath2 4@xmath11 character with _ x _ and _ y _ symmetries .",
    "the respective transitions and dispersions of bands in a fat - band representation are illustrated in fig .",

    "10(a ) , the @xmath145 spectrum around 3 ev is , mainly , formed by transitions into the cu@xmath2 4@xmath152 states ( blue dash - dotted lines ) , while transitions into the 4@xmath153 states ( red dashed lines ) dominantly form the @xmath145 spectra .",
    "because of the large dispersion of these states , the transitions give a rather flat shape of the optical conductivity in this spectral range and spread out up to 5 ev . above 3.2 ev the calculated spectra are formed by the cu@xmath2 3__d _ _ unoccupied states and o 2__p _ _ @xmath154 cu@xmath22 3__d _ _",
    "interband transitions , contributing equally to both @xmath145 and @xmath145 .",
    "let us turn now to the interband transitions associated with the cu@xmath22 3__d _ _ _ final _ states , giving , in particular , the sharp peaks near 1.5 ev in fig .",
    "the decomposition into partial contributions reveals that these peaks are formed by transitions from the occupied cu@xmath2 3@xmath155 bands to the cu@xmath22 3__d _ _ states with @xmath156 symmetry , see fig .",
    "the high intensity and sharpness of the peaks are explained by the low dispersion of the cu@xmath22 3__d@xmath157 _ _ states , lying at the fermi level in the lsda calculations , and the cu@xmath2 3@xmath155 bands near the @xmath158 points of the brillouin - zone in fig .",
    "11(b ) . the _ initial _ states with different symmetries , _ xz _ and _ yz _ , contribute differently to the optical conductivities @xmath145 and @xmath145 , as indicated in fig . 11 . while these transitions have predominantly _ d _ character , the contribution of _ p _ states to the cu@xmath2 3@xmath155 bands",
    "is sufficient to provide a significant transition probability through optical dipole matrix elements .",
    "the above analysis of the interband transitions , which are responsible for the strong anisotropy of the optical properties of , is based on the _ spin - restricted _ lsda calculation which gives a metallic solution with four cu@xmath22 @xmath10-derived bands crossing the fermi level ( fig . 8) .",
    "although a minute gap of less than 0.1 ev opens in lsda calculations for _ spin - spirals _ ( not shown ) , it is still much smaller than the experimental gap of 2 ev .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is that the strength of electronic correlations in the cu@xmath22 @xmath159 shell is strongly underestimated within the lsda .",
    "when properly accounted for , the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath146 would split the half - filled cu@xmath22 @xmath10 bands into occupied lower and unoccupied upper hubbard bands and open an insulating gap .",
    "then , the sharp peaks of the calculated optical conductivity , which appear at @xmath1491.5 ev due to the interband transitions involving the cu@xmath22 @xmath10 _ final _ states ( fig . 8) , would shift to higher photon energies improving the agreement with the measured spectra .    in order to illustrate the effect of the electronic correlations on the optical conductivity of we recalculated its band structure and optical spectra using the lsda+@xmath160 method @xcite .",
    "the lsda+@xmath160 calculations were performed assuming ferromagnetic order of the cu@xmath22 moments .",
    "the value of the exchange integral @xmath161 was fixed to the lsda value of 1 ev , and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath146 was varied from 2 to 8 ev . before presenting the results of the lsda+@xmath160 calculations it is worth recalling that when the so - called atomic limit is used for the double counting term @xcite and non - spherical contributions to @xmath146 and @xmath161 are neglected , the expression for the orbital dependent lsda+@xmath160 potential @xmath162 , which is to be added to the lsda potential , becomes particularly simple : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the occupation of @xmath20-th localized orbital with the spin @xmath165 .",
    "one immediately notices that the main effect of lsda+@xmath160 is to split occupied ( @xmath166 ) and unoccupied ( @xmath167 ) states by shifting the former by @xmath168 downwards and the latter by the same amount upwards with respect to their lsda energy position .",
    "since all the cu@xmath22 @xmath138 states , except for @xmath10  ones , are completely filled already in lsda , they shift by @xmath168 to lower energies when @xmath146 is applied .",
    "the half - filled @xmath10 states contribute substantially to bonding o@xmath11cu @xmath138 states near the bottom of the valence band because of strong @xmath165-type hybridization with o @xmath169 states . in lsda+@xmath160 calculations",
    "the majority spin @xmath10 state becomes fully occupied and moves by @xmath168 downwards .",
    "the occupation of the minority spin @xmath10 state , however , does not go to zero , as one would expect for a formally unoccupied state , but instead remains close to 0.5 due to the strong @xmath10 contribution to the occupied o @xmath170cu @xmath138 bonding states . according to eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the lsda+@xmath160 potential acting on the minority spin cu@xmath22 @xmath10 state is much less than @xmath168 , and the energy of the bands formed by these states remains close to the lsda value . in order to avoid such asymmetric splitting of the @xmath10  bands",
    ", we performed the lsda+@xmath160 calculations with the occupation numbers of the majority and minority spin cu@xmath22 @xmath10 states fixed to 1 and 0 , respectively . in this way the corresponding majority and minority spin bands are shifted by @xmath171 with respect to their lsda position .",
    "the optical conductivities @xmath145 and @xmath145 calculated with @xmath172=6 ev acting on the cu@xmath22 @xmath138 states are presented in fig . 12 ( b ) . with this value of @xmath172 , the unoccupied bands formed by the minority spin cu@xmath22 @xmath10 states lie @xmath1492 ev above the fermi level and , in contrast to the lsda result , the lsda+@xmath160 band structure is insulating with a gap of about 1.8 ev .",
    "the sharp absorption peaks , which are caused by inter - band transitions to the final states of the cu@xmath22 @xmath10 character and appear at @xmath1491.5 ev in the lsda spectra ( fig .",
    "9 ) , shift to 3 ev in much better agreement with the experiment .",
    "the peaks show strong polarization dependence , with the  peak being 0.3 ev lower than the  one . when @xmath173 of 6 ev is applied also to the @xmath138 states of cu@xmath2 ions , the bands formed by cu@xmath2 @xmath8 and @xmath174 states , which are the initial states for the interband transitions responsible for the sharp peaks , shift to lower energies . in this case",
    "all @xmath175 and lsda+@xmath160 mimics to some extent the effect of the so - called self - interaction corrections @xcite by shifting all the cu@xmath2 @xmath138 states downwards .",
    "this brings the conductivity peaks even closer to their experimental positions .",
    "nevertheless , the magnitude of the calculated optical conductivity remains lower than in the experiment .",
    "one would also expect some narrowing of the unoccupied cu@xmath22 @xmath10  bands if the lsda+@xmath160 calculation were performed for the incommensurate magnetic structure observed experimentally.@xcite this could result in sharpening of the peaks and an increase of the calculated conductivity .",
    "our calculations suggest that the origin of the anomalously strong absorption peaks observed at 3.45 and 3.7 ev can be ascribed to the interband cu@xmath2 3@xmath138 @xmath140 cu@xmath22 3@xmath138 transitions .",
    "the observed shift in the peak positions between two polarizations arises from different contributions of transitions from the _ initial _ @xmath174 and @xmath8 states to the optical conductivity , as shown in fig .",
    "the experimentally observed anisotropy of the background , assigned to the cu@xmath2 3@xmath176 4@xmath11  transitions , is due to the different contributions of transitions to the _ final _ states with @xmath152 and @xmath153 characters to the optical conductivities @xmath145 and @xmath145 , as shown in fig .",
    "in our spectroscopic ellipsometry study of , we observed that the spectra of the dielectric function for light polarized parallel to the @xmath5 planes exhibit a strong in - plane anisotropy of the interband excitations .",
    "the absorption edge for polarization along the @xmath6 chains is formed by a two - peak structure centered at 2.15 and 2.65 ev .",
    "this feature is absent in the other polarization and bears striking resemblance to the one observed in the single - valent @xmath6 chain compound @xmath16.@xcite our findings suggest that these modes are a generic feature of mott - hubbard insulators with edge - sharing copper - oxide chains . based on theoretical considerations",
    ", we have also shown that an exciton doublet is expected to emerge as a consequence of the long - range coulomb interaction at energies @xmath177 and @xmath178 upon cooling into a temperature range where substantial spin correlations become established .",
    "identification of this exciton doublet with the experimentally observed two - peak feature allowed us to determine the local hubbard interaction parameter @xmath108 ev and the long range coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath109 ev .",
    "the quantitative information about elementary excitations in insulating chain cuprates gained from the present study may deepen our understanding of the electronic structure and phase behavior of doped cuprates as well . in the doped cuo@xmath141-planes of the cuprate superconductors",
    "the band width is significantly larger , and hence excitons are not expected to appear .",
    "nonetheless , the quantitative description of the effect of the long - range coulomb interaction obtained here may facilitate realistic calculations of the properties of charge density wave and striped states in doped compounds with one - dimensional @xcite and two - dimensional electronic structure .",
    "we have also observed strong and sharp absorption bands peaked at 3.45 ev and 3.7 ev for light polarization along and perpendicular to the @xmath6 chains , respectively , dominating the spectra and superimposed on a flat and featureless plateau background above the absorption edge .",
    "based on density functional calculations , we conclude that the major contribution to the background response comes from the intra - atomic cu@xmath2 3@xmath176 4@xmath11  transitions within the dumbbells .",
    "the experimentally observed anisotropy of the background is explained due to the different characters of the final 4@xmath152 and 4@xmath153 states .",
