    "although the standard model ( sm ) has successfully accounted for all low energy cp - violating phenomena thus far observed , it is insufficient as the source of cp - violation needed to explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry in our universe  @xcite . according to sakharov  @xcite ,",
    "one of the conditions necessary to generate such an asymmetry is that the elementary interaction violates charge conjugation symmetry ( c ) and the combined cp symmetry ( where p is the parity symmetry ) .",
    "however , the size of the asymmetry needed for this can not be derived in model calculations based on the sm  @xcite and new sources of cp violation have been sought for many years in particle physics experiments .",
    "prominent among these are the rare decays @xmath4 which are sensitive to new physics involving both cp - violating and cp - conserving interactions . in this paper , we present a detailed description of the previously reported measurement of the reaction @xmath5 performed by brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) experiment bnl - e949  @xcite .",

    "we first briefly review cp violation and rare kaon decays , with an emphasis on @xmath6 decays .",
    "we then describe previous results on this reaction and discuss the sources of potential background and the methods for suppressing backgrounds .",
    "we also discuss the design of the @xmath1 beamline , the detector and the selection criteria used in data analysis and describe the methods used for estimating background levels and for evaluating the acceptance . after examining the signal region , we present the method used for extracting the branching ratio , making full use of our knowledge of the background in the signal region . in the last section ,",

    "@xmath24 s and @xmath25 s are so far the only two mesons showing evidence of cp violation in their decay processes . whether or not the observed cp violation can be completely explained by the ckm phase within the sm can be probed by the independent determination of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , from @xmath24 and @xmath25 decays as shown in fig .",

    "vanishes if all of the quark masses , @xmath39 , are equal , because of the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "however , the breaking of flavor symmetry , which results in the variation of quark masses , allows this decay to proceed at a very small rate .",

    "theoretically a precise measurement of ( ) is one of the cleanest ways to extract @xmath30 .",
    "this is due to the following factors :    * the long - distance contributions to the branching ratio are small  @xcite and under control , the most recent calculation gives a contribution of ( + 6@xmath733)% to the branching ratio  @xcite ; * the uncertainty from the hadronic matrix element has been reduced to @xmath741% by recent theoretical and experimental developments  @xcite , and * the recent nnlo calculation  @xcite has reduced the total theoretical uncertainties to @xmath726% , i.e. relatively small and reliably calculated as compared with the uncertainties present in other @xmath25 and @xmath24 decays .",
    "if a precise measurement of the neutral analog @xmath75 could also be made , the intrinsic theoretical error on @xmath30 could be reduced to @xmath721%  @xcite .    as determinations of @xmath24-system parameters become increasingly precise , the uncertainty on the sm prediction for   will approach the current theoretical accuracy of @xmath726% .",
    "a correspondingly precise measurement of the  branching ratio therefore provides a stringent test of the sm and probes for new physics .",
    "there have been numerous predictions for   in the models beyond the sm and applications of the measured branching ratio to constrain new models .",
