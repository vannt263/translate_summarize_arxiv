    "anderson localization of waves in one - dimensional random media is associated with an exponential decrease of the wave amplitude inside the disordered , locally - transparent sample , which results in an exponentially small typical transmittance @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the length of the sample , and @xmath4 is the localization length ) .",
    "another manifestation of anderson localization is the existence of resonant frequencies , where the transmission increases drastically , sometimes up to unity .",
    "these frequencies correspond to the quasi - localized eigenstates ( modes , or disorder - induced resonances ) characterized by a high concentration of energy in randomly - located points inside the system .",
    "even though one - dimensional ( 1d ) localization has been intensively studied during the last few decades @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) , most of the analytical results were obtained for mean quantities , i.e. , for values averaged over ensembles of random realizations .",
    "these results are physically meaningful for the self - averaging lyapunov exponent ( inverse localization length ) , which becomes non - random in the macroscopic limit @xcite . for non - self - averaging quantities ( field amplitude and phase , intensity , transmission and refection coefficients , etc . )",
    "a random system of any size is always mesoscopic , and therefore , mean values have little to do with measurements at individual samples .",
    "this is most pronounced when it comes to the disorder - induced resonances whose parameters are extremely volatile and strongly fluctuate from realization to realization @xcite .",
    "in particular , ensemble averaging wipes out all information about the frequencies and locations of individual localized states within a particular sample , even though these data are essential for applications based on harnessing micro and nano cavities with high @xmath5-factors .",
    "nowadays , photonic crystals are believed to be the most suitable platforms for the creation and integration of optical resonators into optical networks . to create an effective resonant cavity that supports localized high-@xmath5 modes in a photonic crystal ( pc ) , it is necessary to break periodicity , i.e. to introduce a defect in a regular system . as fluctuations of the dielectric and geometrical parameters",
    "are inevitably present in any manufactured periodic sample , it could create a serious obstacle in the efficient practical use of pcs",
    ". therefore considerable efforts of researches and manufacturers go into the control of fluctuations . alternatively , if rather than combating imperfections of periodicity , one fabricated highly - disordered samples , they could be equally well harnessed , for example , for creating tunable resonant elements .",
    "this is because 1d random configurations have a unique band structure that for some applications have obvious advantages over those of pc @xcite .",
    "contrary to periodic systems , resonant cavities inherently exist in any ( long enough ) disordered sample , or can be easily created by introducing a non - random element ( for example , homogeneous segment ) into an otherwise random configuration .",
    "the effective wave parameters of these cavities are very sensitive to the fine structure of each sample , and can be easily tuned either by slightly varying the refractive index in a small area inside the sample or , for example , by changing the ratio between the coupling strength and absorption .",
    "this makes possible to shift the resonant frequency ( and thereby to lock and unlock the flow of radiation ) ; to couple modes and create quasi - extended states , etc @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that each localized state at a frequency @xmath6 could be associated with an effective , high @xmath5-factor resonance cavity comprised of almost transparent ( for this frequency ) segment bounded by essentially non - transparent regions ( effective barriers ) .",
    "wave tunneling through such a system can be treated as a particular case of the general problem of the transmission through an open resonator @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of a disorder - induced cavity is that it has no regular walls ( the medium is locally transparent in each point ) , and high reflectivity of the confining barriers is due to the anderson localization .",
    "moreover , different segments of the sample are transparent for different frequencies , i.e. , each localized mode is associated with its own resonator",
    ".      if the medium inside such a cavity is amplifying , the combination of the optical gain and the interference of multiply scattered radiation creates coherent field and gives rise to multi - frequency lasing with sharply peaked lasing spectrum .",
    "random lasers ( rl ) are the subject of increasing scientific interest due to their unusual properties and promising potential applications @xcite . unlike conventional lasers , where any disorder is detrimental , in a random version , scattering plays a positive role increasing the path length and the dwell time of light in the active medium .",
    "so far most studies , both experimental and theoretical , have concentrated on 3d disordered systems and chaotic cavities .",
    "one of the grave drawbacks of 3d random lasers is their inefficient pumping , which is hampered by the scattering of the pumping radiation in the random medium . a one - dimensional rl , which is free from this disadvantage , can be realized either as a random stack of amplifying layers @xcite or as a set of bragg gratings randomly distributed along a doped optical fiber @xcite . in the last case , the wavelength of the pumping laser is shifted from the bragg resonance of the gratings , and the fiber is excited homogeneously along the whole length of the sample .",
    "both these methods reduce noticeably the lasing threshold as compared to 3d random lasing systems .",
    "because the frequencies of the modes and the locations of the effective cavities vary from sample to sample randomly , in the most cases they are described statistically misirpashaev98,zaitsev06,zaitzev09,soukoulis2000,cao2007 .",
    "however , usually we deal with a specific random sample , and it is important to know how many modes and at which frequencies can be excited in a given frequency range ; where these modes are localized inside this sample , etc @xcite .    another field of research in which this information is crucial has arisen recently after it had been realized that anderson resonances could be used to observe cavity quantum electrodynamics effects by embedding a single quantized emitter ( quantum dot ) in a disordered pc waveguide lodahl-1,lodahl-2 . in those experiments ,",
    "the efficiency of the interaction between radiation and disorder - induced cavities depends strongly on the location of the source inside the random sample .",
    "indeed , all qed effects are well - pronounced when the emitter with a given frequency is placed inside the effective cavity , which is resonant at this frequency , and could be completely suppressed otherwise .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an algorithm that enables to detect all cavities and to find their locations and eigen - frequencies for any _ individual _ sample with given geometry and optical parameters .",
    "it is shown that in the case of uncorrelated disorder , the number of disorder - induced resonances per unit frequency interval is independent of the strength of the fluctuations and is uniquely determined by the size of the random sample .",
    "the results have been checked experimentally using rls based on a single - mode fiber with randomly distributed resonant bragg gratings developed in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for a quantitative description of the wave propagation through a disordered sample , it is advantageous to consider it as a random chain of effective regular resonators with given q - factors and coupling coefficients .",
    "the typical size of each resonator is of the order of the localization length , @xmath7 , and their centers are randomly distributed along the sample . for manufacturing rls and for the ability to tailor their properties , it is important to know the location of the resonant cavity for each eigen - frequency @xcite . to this end ,",
    "a criterion is necessary , which enables to determine whether a given area of a disordered sample is either a resonant cavity or a strongly reflecting ( typical ) random segment .    to derive such a criterion for randomly layered media",
    ", we consider a disordered sample consisting of @xmath8  homogeneous layers with thicknesses @xmath9 and dispersionless refractive indices @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) that are statistically independent and uniformly distributed in the intervals @xmath12 and ( @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "( the effects of correlation between the thicknesses of the adjacent blocks have been considered in @xcite ) . in a system with uncorrelated layers ,",
    "the interface between the @xmath14-th and @xmath15-th layers is located at a random point @xmath16 and can be characterized by complex transmission , @xmath17 , and reflection , @xmath18 , coefficients , which are also randomly distributed in the corresponding intervals .",
    "the numeration is chosen from left to right so that @xmath19 .",
    "it is assumed thereafter that the optical contrast between layers is small .",
    "therefore all fresnel reflection coefficients @xmath20 are also small @xmath21and , consequently , @xmath22 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "these coefficients will be assumed real .",
    "generalization to complex - valued @xmath18 and @xmath17 is straightforward .    in what follows , it is convenient to turn to  the _ optical lengths _ ,",
    "i.e. to replace the thicknesses @xmath23 and the coordinates @xmath16 by @xmath24where @xmath10 is the refraction index of the @xmath14-th layer . note that in these notations the wave number has the same value @xmath25 in all layers .    to distinguish between an effective resonator and a bragg reflector",
    ", a proper physical quantity representative of distinctive properties of these objects has to be found . to do this ,",
    "let us consider a wave that propagates rightward from a point @xmath26 [ right side of the interface between the @xmath27-th and @xmath14-th layers ] , where its amplitude is @xmath28 ( thereafter superscripts @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the amplitudes of the waves propagating to the right or to the left , respectively ) .",
    "after traveling through the @xmath14-th layer , the wave is partially reflected back from the interface between the @xmath14-th and @xmath15-th slabs .",
    "the transmitted part extends through @xmath15-th layer and is partially reflected from the next interface , etc .",

    "( [ i m delta ] ) are complex , @xmath52 . if the q - factor of a resonator is large enough , then @xmath53 and @xmath54where @xmath55 is the resonator length .",

    "indeed , when for a segment of @xmath61 layers centered at a point @xmath62  inside a long ( @xmath63 ) disordered sample the imaginary part of @xmath60 is zero at some @xmath35 , this area is either a resonant ( at the frequency @xmath64 ) cavity or a localization - induced resonant bragg reflector .",
    "what it is indeed is determined by the sign of the real part of @xmath65 : in a resonator @xmath66 , while for a bragg grating @xmath67    the last condition is easy to understand if we notice that @xmath68 is @xmath69-fourier harmonics of the function @xmath70,\\ ] ] and @xmath37 is the @xmath71-fourier harmonics of the function @xmath72.\\ ] ] this means that @xmath68 and @xmath37 are bragg reflection coefficients from @xmath42 slabs located to the right and to the left from the @xmath14-th layer , respectively .    since our prime interest here are disorder - induced resonators for which @xmath73 , and because in the localized regime the reflection coefficient from a typical region is close to unity when its length is of the order ( and larger ) of the localization length , for further calculations we have to choose @xmath74 .",
    "important to stress that each resonator is formed in an area of the size of a few localization lengths and is practically unaffected by the outer ( to this area ) parts of the sample .",
    "this means that the eigen - frequency of an effective cavity is independent of it location inside a sample , and does not change if the total length of the sample is increased , for example , by adding more scatterers at its edges .",
    "when the thicknesses of the layers are uncorrelated and the mean thickness @xmath75 is large compared to the wavelength , @xmath76 , the localization length is determined by the mean value of the local reflection coefficients @xmath18 @xcite . to prove this statement , note that the functions @xmath77 , eqs .",
    "( eq2,[eq3 ] ) , are sums of @xmath78 uncorrelated random complex numbers , and therefore can be described in terms of a random walk on the plane @xmath79 with the single step equal to @xmath80 then , the mean absolute value @xmath81 is the mean distance from the origin after @xmath82 steps : @xmath83the characteristic scale of the variation of @xmath77 along the sample measured in number of layers is of the order of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath77 and hence the quantities @xmath85 are smooth random functions of @xmath14 , i.e. of the distance along the sample . as the length @xmath8 of a sample is large enough , @xmath86 , the number of regions where @xmath87 is approximately equal to the number of regions where @xmath88 .",

    "it is easy to see that the largest contribution to @xmath102 comes from the layers that are the most distant from the @xmath14-th layer : @xmath103 \\sim |% \\widetilde{z}_{j}-\\widetilde{z}_{j\\pm { n}_{\\mathrm{loc}}}| \\sim \\nonumber\\\\ { n}_{\\mathrm{loc}}\\widetilde{d}_{0}=l_{\\mathrm{loc}}.   \\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath104 and the characteristic interval @xmath93 between resonant wave numbers localized around an arbitrary point @xmath105  can be estimated as @xmath106 in @xcite this result has been obtained for modes located around the center of the sample .",
    "equations  ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) allow estimating the number of resonances @xmath1 in the given frequency interval @xmath107 in the sample of the length @xmath108 : @xmath109    the number of cavities , @xmath0 , and the spacing between the resonances , @xmath93 , are inversely proportional @xcite to @xmath4 , i.e. , it increases when the strength of the scattering increases .",
    "therefore , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) that @xmath1 does not depend on the localization length . in other words ,",
    "the number of resonances ( and therefore the number of peaks in the transmission spectrum and the number of regions with enhanced intensity ) in a given frequency interval are proportional to the size of the random system and are independent of the strength of disorder .",
    "an important point is that eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) gives the _ total _ number of disorder - induced resonances existing along the whole length of a random system in a given range @xmath91 .",
    "when random lasing is concerned , each sample is an active medium , and a new parameter  the specific gain rate @xmath110  should be involved . in evaluating the number of _ lasing _",
    "modes , this parameter has to be compared with the lasing threshold @xmath111 of each cavity , which is different for different ones . as it has been shown in @xcite and mentioned in the introduction above , each disorder - induced resonator occupying an area @xmath112 is built of strongly reflecting ( as a result of anderson localization ) effective barriers that confine an almost transparent ( for the given resonant wave number @xmath89 ) region .",
    "reflection coefficients of the left and right ( from the center ) parts of this structure are large , which means that the normalized amplitudes @xmath113 of the @xmath114-harmonics of the distributions @xmath115 [ eqs .",
    "( [ distribution_1 ] ) , ( [ distribution_2 ] ) ] of the scatterers in these parts of @xmath14-th cavity are large , @xmath116 .",
    "however , the value @xmath117 of the amplitude of the @xmath118-harmonics of the distribution @xmath119 of the scatterers along the _ _  whole _ _ cavity , can be small , or even equal to zero .",
    "indeed , since @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122the value of @xmath123 is small when @xmath124 is close to unity . for given values of @xmath125 and @xmath126 ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath127 is smaller the greater is @xmath124 . in the extreme case",
    ", the amplitude @xmath128 turns to zero , i.e. , the @xmath118-harmonics is completely suppressed .",
    "this happens when the amplitudes @xmath129 have equal absolute values but opposite signs , i.e. are shifted in phase by @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the ( positive ) value of @xmath124 can be treated as a measure of the amplitude of the @xmath118-harmonics of the cavity and of the phase shift between the @xmath118-harmonics of its left and right parts .    in a real random sample ,",
    "the @xmath118-harmonics of the spatial distributions @xmath131 of scatterers are not equal to zero in any effective cavity and for any @xmath89 ( any frequency @xmath132 ) , including the resonant ones .",
    "these harmonics provide distributed feedback , as it occurs , for instance , in conventional ( not random ) semiconductor distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as in a conventional dfb laser with regular bragg grating ( regular periodic spatial distribution of the scatterers ) , in a disorder - induced cavity a lasing mode is excited when the gain rate @xmath110 of the medium exceeds the value @xmath111 of the threshold of the cavity .",
    "the difference between these two cases is that the whole periodic grating is characterized by a single value of @xmath133 , while different parts of a random configuration have their own different thresholds @xmath111 , whose values are minimal into the cavities . in just the same way as the phase shift between two identical halves of the regular grating causes to decrease the threshold in conventional dfb lasers @xcite , the phase difference between complex amplitudes @xmath134 and @xmath135 reduces the lasing threshold of the @xmath118-resonant random cavity . from the considerations presented in the previous paragraph it follows that the information about @xmath111 is also contained in the quantities @xmath136",
    ": the greater @xmath137 is for a given cavity , the smaller is its threshold @xmath111 .",
    "thus , only those cavities whose thresholds @xmath111 are less than the medium gain @xmath110 ( i.e. the values @xmath137 exceed the critical value @xmath138 ) , contribute to the formation of the lasing spectrum .",
    "therefore the number of lasing modes ( number of lines in the lasing spectrum ) is definitely smaller than the total number of cavities @xmath1 .    to conclude this section we note that approach presented above could be used in studying various wave systems , for example , thz tunable vortex photonic crystals . indeed ,",
    "many calculations on this problem have already been performed @xcite , including the role of disorder , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "to verify the results of the previous section , we have calculated the function @xmath46 numerically for different random samples , and have found the distribution of the areas with @xmath87 and @xmath139 along each sample for different wave numbers .",
    "these distributions have been mapped on the coordinate  wave - number plane in fig .",
    "[ l - k_plot ] .",
    "then , the eigenvalues , @xmath51 , have been determined from eq .",
    "( [ i m delta ] ) , and spatial distributions of the intensity created inside the samples by the incident waves with the corresponding resonant frequencies ( @xmath140 ) have been found and compared with the map . to facilitate this comparison ,",
    "we take into account that the intensity pumped by the incident wave into a cavity depends on its location inside the sample : it decreases exponentially as the distance of the cavity from the input end increases @xcite . as an example , the intensity distributions along the same sample illuminated by the same wave , either from the left @xmath141 ( blue curve ) , or from the right , @xmath142 , ( red curve ) ends are shown in fig .  [ fig_2]a .    in both curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , the intensity in the closest to the input cavity is far above the intensity inside the more distant one .",

    "correlation cross - correlation functions , @xmath149 , of those two types of curves reveal strong correlation between the normalized intensity and @xmath150 .",
    "one can see that the cavities are well detected by the @xmath151 criterion .",
    "figure  [ fig.numer_simulation_nres ] demonstrates that , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) , the number of resonances in a given frequency interval is independent of the strength of disorder ( of the values of the local reflection coefficients @xmath18 ) and of the variance of the fluctuations of the thicknesses @xmath23 , and is completely determined by the size of the sample .",
    "this rather counter - intuitive result is also supported by the numerical simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_new ] , where the locations of the resonant cavities in the coordinate - frequency plane are shown ( marked in black ) for two samples .",
    "the samples are geometrically identical , i.e. have the same spatial distribution of the scatterers , and differ only in the amplitudes of their reflection coefficients , so that the localization length at the upper picture is twice larger than in the lower panel . when comparing both images in fig .",
    "[ fig_new ] , it is easy to see that in passing from one picture to another the sizes of the black areas in the @xmath152-direction increase while the distances between them along the @xmath153-axis decrease in the same proportion , so that , in keeping with eq .  ( [ eq17 ] ) , @xmath154 remains the same , meaning that there is no dependence of the number of resonances on the localization length .",
    "the experimental detection of disorder - induced cavities and resonances is a challenging task in optics .",
    "although the intensity distribution can not be measured directly , the resonances , in principle , can be revealed by transmission experiments at different frequencies .",
    "however , although resonant transmission in lossless systems is essentially higher than at typical frequencies , it is much stronger affected by absorption , which is proportional to the exponentially large intensity inside resonators . in microwave experiments @xcite , where the absorption length was much larger than the total length of the system ( single - mode waveguide ) , the transmission was bellow the noise level even at centrally located resonances .",
    "this fact was of little concern in that case because the microwave probe could be inserted in different points inside the waveguide . in fiber optic systems",
    ", however , this is not possible . with long optical fibers , to make the transmission measurable it might be necessary to compensate for the absorption by , for example , introducing amplification .",
    "when the amplification is sufficiently large , all resonances manifest themselves as sharp lines in the transmission spectrum .",
    "experimental studies of resonances in disordered optical fibers with active elements is also of interest for a better understanding of the physics of rl , because in amplifying media all resonant modes are potential candidate for lasing .",
    "the ability to monitor and to tailor their parameters , especially the total number , eigen frequencies , and locations is critical to fulfill this potential .",
    "random one - dimensional cavities can be created in optical fibers by the introduction of randomly - positioned reflectors , in the form of bragg gratings @xcite . to create such structures ,",
    "we have used commercial er / ge co - doped fibers ( ino quebec , qc , canada ) that are single - mode at 1535 nm .",
    "erbium is the active element and germanium doping provides a kind of photosensitivity that can be used to change , locally , the refractive index .",
    "the bragg gratings were fabricated by exposing the fiber to uv light ( 244 nm ) from a frequency doubled argon ion laser through a periodic mask whose spatial period is 1059.8 nm .",
    "each one of the fabricated gratings had a length of approximately @xmath155 mm .",

    "while the relative intensity of the peaks can change with the pump power , their spectral positions ( indicated by the vertical lines in the figure ) remain fixed .    another interesting feature that can be observed in fig .",
    "[ laser_emission ] is that , once an emission line appears in a system with a low number of gratings , it is likely to reappear in a system with a higher number of gratings .",
    "one can see , for example , that the emission lines observed with the system with seven gratings are also present in the systems with more gratings .",
    "the curves shown in fig [ fig.time_variation ] represent spectra of the radiation emitted by a random laser with 22 gratings , measured in 1 second intervals . even at constant pumping power ,",
    "the number of well - defined lasing modes and their emission intensity fluctuate in time .",
    "the emission frequencies , however , remain fixed ; one can see that they always coincide with one of the vertical lines of the figure .",
    "the observed fluctuations of the intensity of the spectral lines could not be caused by relatively small ( @xmath1725% ) fluctuations of the intensity of the pumping laser , and apparently were associated with non - linear effects . indeed , despite the relatively low power of the emission , the field inside the high-@xmath5 cavities can be strong enough ( due to resonance ) to generate a kerr - type nonlinearity .",
    "these effects are of importance , for example , in distributed bragg reflector fiber lasers that are longer than @xmath173 cm @xcite    the black points in fig .",
    "[ fig.numer_exp_theory ] denote the number of lasing modes measured in the wavelength range @xmath174 nm in samples with different numbers of gratings @xmath164 ( and different lengths of the system ; @xmath165 , @xmath175 mm ) .",
    "these numbers were obtained by adding all the emission lines present in the emission spectra over an extended period of time .",
    "the amount of the lasing modes growths linearly with the length of the system , although , in accordance with the theoretical reasoning above , it is always less than the total number of the effective resonant cavities in the sample ( fig .",
    "ntransexp ) .",
    "to conclude , eigen - modes ( resonances ) of a randomly layered long ( @xmath176 ) sample are localized in disorder - induced effective cavities of the size of the order of the localization length that are randomly distributed along the sample . an algorithm for finding this distribution in an individual configuration with arbitrary ( random ) parameters",
    "was developed based on the calculation of the function @xmath177 in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "it was shown that a cavity of an effective size of a few localization lengths , in which a mode with @xmath178 can be localized , exists around @xmath14-th layer when @xmath179 and @xmath180 in the case of uncorrelated disorder and weak scattering , the spacing between eigen - levels and the number of cavities @xmath1 in a given frequency interval does not depend on the strength of disorder , and are uniquely determined by the size of the sample .",
    "the frequency of each resonance is independent of the coordinate of the effective cavity , in which it is located .",
    "the number of lasing modes depends also on the ratio between the threshold values @xmath111 of the individual cavities and the gain @xmath110 of the medium , and is less than @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical predictions and numerical results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data obtained by measuring the emission spectra of the random laser based on the single - mode fiber with randomly distributed bragg gratings .",
