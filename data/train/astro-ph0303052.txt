    "because low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are most likely dominated by dark matter at all radii ( e.g. , de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; verheijen 1997 ; swaters , madore , & trewhella 2000 ) , they are ideal for studying the power law slopes of the central dark matter density distributions @xmath0 .",
    "cosmological simulations indicate @xmath1 depends on the nature of the dark matter ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; coln , avila - reese , & valenzuela 2000 ; dav et al .  2001 ; knebe et al .",
    "thus , a measurement of @xmath1 may provide constraints on the nature of dark matter in galaxies and theories of galaxy formation .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to measure the inner slope @xmath1 observationally .",
    "observations have relatively low angular resolution and are affected by beam smearing ( swaters 1999 , hereafter s99 ; swaters et al .",
    "2000 ; van den bosch et al .  2000",
    "; mcgaugh , rubin , & de blok 2001 ) ; hence  observations generally are less suited to measure @xmath1 accurately .",
    "long - slit observations provide higher angular resolution , but studies based on such observations find conflicting results .",
    "some find lsb galaxies are consistent with steep inner slopes ( swaters 2001 ; swaters et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter smvdbb ) , yet others find them inconsistent with steep slopes ( de blok et al",
    ". 2001a , b ; de blok & bosma 2002 , hereafter dbb ; marchesini et al .",
    "this inconsistency remains even when identical datasets are used ( smvdbb ) .",
    "the apparent discrepancy can be explained , in part , by systematic effects of slit width , seeing , slit offsets and galaxy inclination , which all lead to an underestimate of @xmath1 ( smvdbb ) .",
    "= 1.0    to avoid systematic effects of long - slit observations , and to map possible non - circular motions , it is necessary to obtain high spatial resolution , two - dimensional velocity fields ( see also beauvais & bothun 1999 ) .",
    "blais - ouellette et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented such observations for the dwarf lsb galaxies ngc  3109 and ic  2574 .",
    "unfortunately , both galaxies are less suited to address the core issue ; ngc  3109 is close to edge - on , and ic  2574 has a poorly sampled velocity field and a perturbed interstellar medium ( walter & brinks 1999 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present a high - resolution , two - dimensional velocity field of the lsb galaxy ddo  39 .",
    "this galaxy was selected because of its suitable inclination of @xmath2 , low surface brightness ( @xmath3 mag arcsec@xmath4 , swaters & balcells 2002 ) , disk dominated radial surface brightness profile with a disk scale length of @xmath5  kpc at an adopted distance of 12.8 mpc ( s99 ) , regular optical and  morphology , and well - behaved  kinematics ( see fig .",
    "[ figvfs ] ) .",
    "these properties make ddo  39 an ideal galaxy to study the kinematics in the central regions of an lsb galaxy .",
    "ddo  39 was observed with the sparsepak integral field unit on the 3.5 m wiyn telescope on january 11 , 12 and 13 , 2002 .",
    "sparsepak is a fiber - optic array containing 82 fibers , each @xmath6 in diameter and separated by @xmath7 , arranged in a sparsely packed grid , @xmath8 on each side , with a small , nearly - integral core .",
    "seven sky fibers are spaced between @xmath9 and @xmath10 away from the central fiber .",
    "the grid can be fully sampled in three pointings . for a detailed description ,",
    "see bershady et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the fibers are fed to the wiyn bench spectrograph .",
    "we used the 860 l / mm grating in second order at 6600  , yielding a fwhm velocity resolution of 66 . in the first two nights we filled the grid with three @xmath11  min integrations ; in the third night we integrated @xmath12  hour on the central pointing .",
    "the iraf dohydra package was used for data reduction and extraction of the spectra .",
    "sky subtraction was done by creating a two - dimensional image of extracted spectra , filtering out the h@xmath1 lines , and subtracting a low order baseline ( bershady et al , in preparation ) . to determine the actual telescope pointing and offsets",
    ", we calculated the expected relative continuum flux for all fibers from an @xmath13-band image of ddo  39 , and compared this to our observations . by minimizing the @xmath14 difference",
    ", the pointing offsets could be determined with an accuracy of @xmath15 ( swaters et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we constructed a sparse velocity field by fitting gaussians to spectra with  emission stronger than three times the noise level and placing the derived velocities in a map at the corresponding positions . to construct a contiguous velocity field for graphical presentation",
    ", the points in the sparse velocity field were interpolated after weighting with a gaussian beam of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these velocity fields , shown in fig",
    ".  [ figvfs ] , highlight the kinematics in the central regions and over the entire sparsepak field of view .",
    "because of the interpolation , the isovelocity contours may be uncertain , especially at the edges .",
    "to determine the galaxy orientation parameters , we fitted a tilted ring model to the sparse velocity field . because of the approximately linear rise of the rotation curve ( rc ) , it was not possible to determine the center or the inclination kinematically from the sparsepak data . instead , we used the optical center at @xmath18 @xmath19 ( j2000 ) .",
    "although the inner rotation curve shape depends somewhat on the choice of center , the main results of this letter do not . for the inclination we used @xmath2 , derived from the  observations .",
    "the position angle and systemic velocity were found to be consistent with the @xmath20 and 818  of the  observations , and we used the latter .    with these orientation parameters , all points in the sparse velocity field were corrected for projection effects . to determine the rotation velocity ,",
    "points were averaged in concentric annuli with a width of @xmath21 .",
    "each point was assigned a weight of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the angle in the plane of the galaxy with respect to the major axis , and @xmath24 is the error on the radial velocity , with an imposed minimum of 4 .",
    "the error on the rotation velocity was taken to be the quadratic sum of the formal error and one fourth of the difference between the approaching and receding sides , with an imposed minimum error of 2 .",
    "the rc derived in this way was combined with the  rc from s99 to create the hybrid rc shown in fig .",
    "[ figrc]a .",
    "[ figrc]a shows good agreement between our rc and the rc derived by s99 from  data .",
    "[ figrc]b compares dbb s long - slit data and our data within @xmath25 of the major axis .",
    "there is good general agreement , although the velocities derived by dbb tend to be somewhat closer to the systemic velocity .",
    "[ figrc]c compares our rc to the one derived by dbb .",
    "although consistent within the errors , their rc is substantially lower where independent optical data are used ( dbb also used s99 s data beyond @xmath26 ) .",
    "the reason for this is unclear , but the fact that we used two - dimensional data and dbb spline - interpolated their binned data to derive their rc are both likely to play a role .      above",
    "we have assumed that the gas moves on circular orbits",
    ". however , the  velocity fields in fig .  [ figvfs ] reveal significant noncircular motions . because the velocity fields might be affected by interpolation ,",
    "we have also plotted the data directly . in fig .",
    "[ figrings ] we plot the observed radial velocities with respect to systemic velocity in different radial intervals , normalized by the rotation velocity . at large radii the radial velocities follow the curve expected for circular rotation closely . on the other hand , in the innermost regions there are clear deviations from simple circular motions .    fig .",
    "[ figrings ] also shows that there is significant scatter around the best fit rotation velocity . the scatter ( before normalization )",
    "is around 9 , independent of radius .",
    "the scatter is in part due to observational uncertainties .",
    "measurement errors depend on the signal - to - noise ratio and range from 2 to around 8  for the weakest lines , and average about 4 . additional scatter may arise if the intensity weighted position of the  over the fiber `` beam '' does not coincide with the center of that fiber . the maximum contribution of this effect , modeled by calculating the extreme velocities in each fiber and comparing those to the expected velocities , is found to be lower than 3  at all radii . subtracting the dominant sources of observational uncertainties from the observed dispersion in the rings , we find the intrinsic fiber - to - fiber line - of - sight dispersion is around 8 .    because the dispersion @xmath27 is comparable to the rotation velocity @xmath28 in the central regions , it may be necessary to correct the rc to obtain the circular velocity .",
    "if one assumes the dispersion represents pressure support due to random motions , then , assuming axisymmetry and absence of radial motions , the correction can be calculated and is found to be negligible ( see e.g. , s99 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if one assumes the central regions are in a steady state , one can calculate the circular velocity @xmath29 using the virial theorem , @xmath30 .",
    "although the kinetic energy in rotation @xmath31 and in random motions @xmath32 depend on the distribution of the gas , and the gravitational potential @xmath33 depends on the total mass distribution , comparison to more detailed calculations    -0.3 cm    show the circular velocity is approximately equal to : @xmath34 assuming an isotropic dispersion ( @xmath35 ) results in a steeper rc ( see fig .",
    "[ figmassmodels ] ) .    because the origins of the dispersion and noncircular motions are not known , and",
    "because the assumptions for the corrections may not be valid , these corrections are uncertain and merely give an indication of the possible range .",
    "the contribution of the stellar disk to the rc was calculated from the @xmath13-band light profile presented in swaters & balcells ( 2002 ) , and the contribution of  was calculated from the  surface density profile presented in swaters et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , scaled up by a factor of 1.32 to account for helium .",
    "the stellar disk was assumed to have a vertical sech - squared distribution with a scale height @xmath36  kpc , and the  disk was assumed to be infinitely thin . for the dark matter halo we considered a generalized nfw halo of the form : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the scale radius and @xmath39 the central density .",
    "these two parameters are linked to the more commonly used parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , depending on cosmology ( see section  [ secdisc ] ) .",
    "we have fit mass models over a range of @xmath1 and mass - to - light ratios ( m / ls ) . in each fit @xmath1 and the m / ls",
    "were kept fixed and the halo parameters were allowed to vary .",
    "confidence levels were not calculated because the velocities and their errors are not free of systematic effects , and hence the @xmath14 values were only used for relative comparison between the models . in fig .",
    "[ figgenfits ] we plot the resulting @xmath42 values as a function of @xmath1 for an m / l of 1 .",
    "fits to the uncorrected and pressure corrected rcs give virtually identical results , with best fits in the range @xmath43 .",
    "for    -0.3 cm    the rc corrected using the virial theorem , best fits are found for somewhat steeper inner slopes , in the range @xmath44 .",
    "for higher values of @xmath1 the quality of the fits decreases rapidly .",
    "best fitting mass models for an m / l of 1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figmassmodels ] , for @xmath45 ( the nfw profile ) and @xmath46 .",
    "the difference between the @xmath46 and @xmath45 models are predominantly in the inner 1 kpc , where the rc is most affected by noncircular and random motions ( fig .",
    "[ figmassmodels ] ) .",
    "the best fitting parameters for a range of m / ls and @xmath45 are given in table  [ tabfitpars ] , both for the pressure corrected rc and the one corrected with eq .",
    "[ eqvirial ] and @xmath35 .",
    "the high - resolution velocity field of the lsb galaxy ddo  39 presented here reveals the presence of noncircular motions in the central regions and an intrinsic fiber - to - fiber dispersion of about 8 .",
    "the origin of either component is unclear ; ddo  39 does not have a strong bar or spiral arms , nor does it appear to be interacting .",
    "likely contributors are : star formation activity , turbulence , and small scale structure in the disk or dark halo . irrespective of their origin",
    ", the noncircular motions and the large @xmath47 in the galaxy center make an accurate measurement of the circular velocity curve difficult .    as a result ,",
    "inner slopes in the range @xmath48 are consistent with the data , and ddo  39 is compatible with a wide range of dark matter properties .",
    "specifically , it appears that the data presented here are consistent with the inner slopes expected in the currently popular @xmath49cdm paradigm . although earlier simulations predicted inner slopes ranging from @xmath50 ( e.g. , fukushige & makino 1997 , moore et al .",
    "1999 ) to @xmath45 ( e.g. , nfw ) , a recent study by power et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggests that the differences in @xmath1 are mainly due to resolution issues , and places an upper limit to @xmath1 of 1.2 .",
    "taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) , based on analytical arguments , find @xmath1 may be as low as 0.75 at very small radii .          & & + & @xmath40 & @xmath51 & @xmath42 & @xmath40 & @xmath51 & @xmath42 + 0 & 6.1 & 90 & 0.77 & 7.1 & 83 & 0.51 + 1 & 4.4 & 93 & 0.72 & 5.6 & 83 & 0.46 + 2 & 2.1 & 148 & 0.75 & 4.0 & 92 & 0.44 + 4 & 1.0 & 150 & 0.81 & 1.4 & 143 & 0.46 + 1 & 10@xmath52 & 54 & 4.0 & 10@xmath52 & 54 & 2.6 +    even though the data presented here eliminate several uncertainties that gave poor constraints on @xmath1 from  and long - slit observations ( van den bosch et al .",
    "2000 , van den bosch & swaters 2001 , smvdbb , but see de blok et al .",
    "2001a , b ) , the intrinsic noncircular and random motions still result in poor constraints on @xmath1 . given that deviations from circular motions seem common in lsb galaxies ( e.g. , walter & brinks 1999 , de blok & walter 2000 ) , and are present even in a very lsb galaxy such as ddo  39",
    ", it seems that an accurate measurement of @xmath1 and , from that , a tight limit on the nature of dark matter may be difficult to achieve observationally from a component that is susceptible to kinematic perturbations .",
    "fortunately , the halo concentration parameter @xmath40 is better constrained observationally as it is derived from a fit to the rc as a whole rather than mostly from the central parts , although it may still be affected by systematic effects ( smvdbb ) .",
    "for the case of @xmath45 , the inferred halo parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be      compared to the values expected in a @xmath49cdm cosmology .",
    "expected values have a @xmath53 range from 5 to 25 , with an average of around 10 to 15 ( nfw , bullock et al .",
    "ddo  39 s @xmath54 is at the low end of this distribution , and for different values of @xmath40 the quality of the fit changes rapidly .",
    "for example , @xmath55 is inconsistent with the data ( see fig .  [ figmassmodels ] and table  [ tabfitpars ] ) .",
    "the low value for @xmath40 does not necessarily indicate an inconsistency with @xmath49cdm .",
    "for example , a bias toward low @xmath40 values in lsb galaxies could be explained if lsb galaxies preferentially form in low density halos .",
    "in addition , the concentration parameter also depends on the slope of the power spectrum of density fluctuations , and @xmath56 is in agreement with models in which structure formation on small scales is suppressed ( zentner & bullock 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 would be higher if ddo  39 were closer than the adopted 12.8 mpc .",
    "accurate rcs determined from high resolution , two - dimensional velocity fields for a sample of lsb galaxies with intermediate inclinations , accurate centers , and regular kinematics and morphology may provide rcs to measure @xmath40 , or any parameter that depends on the global shape of the rc , with sufficient accuracy to provide useful constraints on the nature of dark matter ."
