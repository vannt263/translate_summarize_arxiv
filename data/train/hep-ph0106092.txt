    "<S> we discuss the properties of fragmentation functions arising from the interference of two leading hadrons produced inside the same jet in the current fragmentation region of a hard process . for the case of semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , a proper folding of the cross section , integrated over the azimuthal position of the detected hadrons , produces a factorized form that allows for the extraction of the quark transversity distribution at leading twist . </S>",
    "<S> using an extended spectator model , explicit calculations are shown for the hadron pair being two pions with invariant mass inside the @xmath0 resonance width .    fragmentation functions ( ff ) , like distribution functions ( df ) , describe the nonperturbative properties of partons when confined inside hadronic bound states at a low scale . </S>",
    "<S> factorization theorems for hard processes , whenever available , ensure their univsersality . </S>",
    "<S> several df have been experimentally extracted and are parametrized with high accuracy . however , one of them , the quark transversity @xmath1 , is still unknown because it is connected to soft processes that flip chirality ; as such , it is , e.g. , unaccessible in inclusive dis . among alternative measurements , </S>",
    "<S> the single spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive dis seem more favourable . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a new generation of machines ( hermes , compass , erhic ) allows for a better resolution in the final state and precise semi - inclusive measurements are becoming feasible . </S>",
    "<S> in this context , naive time - reversal odd ( for brevity , `` t - odd '' ) ff naturally arise because no constraints from time - reversal invariance can be imposed due to the existence of final state interactions ( fsi ) with or inside the residual jet  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of these t - odd ff are also chiral odd , and they can be shown to represent the natural partner to isolate @xmath1 already at leading twist . in a field - theoretical description that assumes factorization , the soft processes linking the fragmenting quark to the observed hadron(s ) are defined as matrix elements of nonlocal operators involving quarks and gluons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest one at leading twist is the quark - quark correlator describing the decay of a quark @xmath2 into a detected hadron @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> if the transverse momentum @xmath4 is measured with respect to the 3-momentum transfer @xmath5 and the quark is transversely polarized , a t - odd chiral - odd ff arises and allows for the extraction of @xmath1 via a single spin asymmetry ( the socalled collins effect )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the lack of collinear factorization the soft - gluon radiation needs to be taken into account and can lead to a severe suppression of the effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , knowledge of the collins function implies the difficult task of modelling fsi between the observed hadron and the residual jet  @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , it is more convenient to select processes where two leading hadrons @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are detected in the same jet , that acts as a spectator  @xcite . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> collinear factorization holds and the cross section would not be suppressed by sudakov form factors ; moreover , fsi are more easily modelled inside the pair . </S>",
    "<S> if the two hadrons are unpolarized , four ff appear at leading twist : @xmath9  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they depend on the light - cone quark momentum fractions @xmath10 delivered to the hadrons ( @xmath11 ) , on the transverse relative momentum @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) , on @xmath14 and @xmath15  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each ff is also related to a specific spin state of the fragmenting quark : @xmath16 is the analogue of the collins effect ; on the contrary , @xmath17 represents a genuine new effect relating the transverse polarization of the fragmenting quark ( @xmath18 ) to the transverse relative dynamics of the detected pair ( @xmath19 ) , i.e. it is an `` analyzing power '' that transforms @xmath18 into the relative orbital angular momentum of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 are t - odd and are nonvanishing only in the presence of residual fsi , at least between the two hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath21 are also chiral odd and can be identified as the chiral partner needed to access the transversity @xmath1  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section at leading twist for the process @xmath22 has been worked out in detail in ref .  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we will reconsider the case for an unpolarized beam and a transversely polarized target . </S>",
    "<S> the lab frame can be defined by the plane containing the beam 3-momentum @xmath23 and the target polarization @xmath24 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering plane , which contains the scattered lepton 3-momentum @xmath25 and @xmath23 , is rotated by the azimuthal angle @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the socalled hadronic plane , which contains @xmath27 and @xmath28 , is rotated by @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> a further plane , which is just sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] for sake of simplicity , contains @xmath30 and , consequently , @xmath19 ; it is rotated by @xmath31 with respect to the lab . </S>",
    "<S> the nine - fold differential cross section depends on the energy fraction taken by the scattered lepton ( @xmath32 ) , on @xmath26 , on the quark light - cone momentum fraction @xmath33 of the target momentum @xmath34 , on @xmath35 and @xmath4 . since @xmath36  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the cross section can be more conveniently considered differential with respect to the pair invariant mass @xmath37 and @xmath38 . by integrating over the `` internal '' dynamics ( i.e. on @xmath39 ) and by properly folding the cross section over the experimental set of beam and hadron - pair azimuthal positions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 and @xmath38 , it is possible to come to the factorized expression @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant , @xmath42 is the total energy in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath43 are the masses of the two observed hadrons , and a sum over the flavor @xmath44 of each quark and antiquark with charge @xmath45 is performed ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the integrated function @xmath17 will depend on both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , contrary to the assumption proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting also that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finalx ] ) suggests a simpler measurement with respect to the case where only one hadron is detected . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , here only the azimuthal position @xmath38 of the pair is required , while in order to measure the collins effect both the azimuthal angle and the @xmath48 hadron momentum need to be known ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) .     + </S>",
    "<S> a b c    quantitative predictions for @xmath49 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finalx ] ) can be produced by extending the spectator model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the case of the emission of a hadron pair . for the hadron pair being a proton and a pion , </S>",
    "<S> results have been published in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where fsi arise from the interference between the direct production and the roper decay . here </S>",
    "<S> , results are shown for the case of two pions with invariant mass in the range @xmath50 $ ] , with @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the spectator state has the quantum numbers of an onshell quark with constituent mass @xmath53 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the quark decay at leading twist with the minimal number of vertices is represented by the set of diagrams shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , where now t - odd ff arise from the contribution of diagram [ fig2]c through the interference between the direct production of the two @xmath54 and the @xmath0 decay . </S>",
    "<S> explicit check has been made that the direct diagrams [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b qualitatively reproduce the experimental strength in the @xmath34- and @xmath55-channels , respectively , which represent most of the total @xmath56 production strength . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , @xmath57 \\times h_1^ { { < \\kern -0.3em \\scriptscriptstyle { ) } } }   ( z , m_h^2=m_\\rho^2)$ ] of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finalx ] ) is shown for the case @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that a nonvanishing integrated interference ff survives allowing for the extraction of @xmath1 at leading twist , as suggested by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : finalx ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that charge conservation for the diagrams of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] implies that the same results are obtained for the processes @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which differ just by the interchange @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath62-integrated amplitudes for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 quarks leading to the same @xmath65 final state cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> if only the valence quark content is considered for the proton ( @xmath66 ) and neutron ( @xmath67 ) targets , then the cross section at leading twist for the @xmath68 process turns out the same as for the @xmath69 one . </S>",
    "<S> experimental tests of this conjecture could shed light both on the validiy of the spectator approximation and on the kinematical range where only the leading twist can be safely considered . </S>"
