    "it is likely that self - gravity will , at times , play an important role in the evolution of accretion discs .",
    "in particular we expect it to be important in discs around active galactic nuclei @xcite and in discs around very young protostars @xcite .",
    "although we will discuss some general properties of self - gravitating discs , we will focus more on protostellar discs , than on other types of potentially self - gravitating accretion discs .",
    "an accretion disc will be self - gravitating , or susceptible to the growth of the gravitational instability , if the toomre parameter , @xmath0 , is close to unity @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the sound speed , @xmath3 is the epicyclic frequency ( equal to the orbital angular frequency in keplerian discs ) , @xmath4 is the disc s surface density , and @xmath5 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this parameter , however , only tells us if the disc s self - gravity is important and if it will likely develop a gravitational instability .",
    "it does nt , however , tell is how such discs will actually evolve",
    ".    there are two likely pathways for a self - gravitating disc .",
    "it could settle into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state @xcite , or it could become so unstable that it fragments into bound objects @xcite .",
    "the latter could be a potential star formation process in discs around active galactic nuclei @xcite , or a mechanism for forming planets , or brown dwarfs , in discs around young stars @xcite .",
    "even if a disc does not fragment , a self - gravitating phase could play a very important role in driving angular momentum transport and , hence , allowing mass to accrete onto the central protostar @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will summarise our current understanding of the evolution of self - gravitating accretion discs .",
    "there are a number of factors that likely determine the evolution of such discs .",
    "in particular , the balance between heating and cooling , and the mass of the disc relative to the mass of the central object . we ll discuss if we can establish the conditions which determine whether a self - gravitating disc will settle into a quasi - steady state , or fragment , and - if so - when such conditions are valid , and when they might be violated .",
    "we ll look at the role of external factors , such as external irradiation and perturbations from stellar , or sub - stellar , companions .",
    "we ll also discuss , in the context of protostellar discs , whether or not we expect fragmentation to actually occur and - if so - where it is likely to occur and what we might expect the outcome to be .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in section 2",
    "we focus on the quasi - steady evolution of self - gravitating discs , how such discs evolve under the influence of external irradiation , what happens if the disc mass is high relative to the mass of the central object , and what might happen if we consider more realistic scenarios .",
    "in section 3 we focus on the fragmentation of self - gravitating discs .",
    "in particular we consider what conditions determine if a disc will fragment , when such conditions may apply and when they may be violated , could it be stochastic rather than precisely determined , and could fragmentation be triggered by external perturbations . in section 4",
    "we then discuss these results and draw conclusions .",
    "as already mentioned , a self - gravitating disc is one that has sufficient mass , or that is cold enough , so that the toomre parameter , @xmath0 , is of order unity .",
    "such a self - gravitating disc will generate an instability that will dissipate and heat the disc . if the cooling rate can match the rate at which the instability is heating the disc , the system may then sustain a state of marginal stability @xcite . if not , the system may fragment to form bound objects , potentially protoplanets or brown dwarfs in discs around young stars @xcite , or stars in discs around active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "if such a system does maintain a state of marginal stability , one would expect the instability to transport angular momentum . a standard way to describe angular momentum transport in discs",
    "is to assume that it is viscous and can be described using the @xmath6-prescription @xcite .",
    "energy transport in a self - gravitating disc , however , is not diffusive and so does nt , strictly speaking , satisfy this condition @xcite .",
    "numerical studies @xcite have , however , shown that the @xmath6-prescription can be a reasonable way to parametrise angular momentum transport in self - gravitating discs .",
    "one of the first studies to quantify this @xcite used a local shearing sheet in which the cooling time , @xmath7 , was assumed to be a constant , @xmath8 , divided by the local angular frequency , @xmath3 : @xmath9 such a cooling formalism has now become known as @xmath8-cooling .",
    "what this work showed was that , as expected , if the disc settled into a quasi - steady state , the dissipation rate would match the imposed cooling , and the effective viscous @xmath6 would then be given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the specific heat ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : slice_10_1k ] shows an example of the quasi - steady , surface density structure in a local shearing sheet simulation in which the imposed cooling is assumed to have @xmath12 and in which @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha_tc10 ] shows the resulting @xmath6 evolution .",
    "the simulation is initially run with no cooling , which is then turned on at @xmath14 .",
    "there is an initial burst and then the system settles into a quasi - steady state with an approximately constant @xmath6 .",
    "the dashed line shows the @xmath6 value to which we d expect it to settle , based on equation ( [ eq : alpha_gammie ] ) .     and @xmath15 .",
    "the disc has settled into a quasi - steady .",
    "self - regulated state in which heating via dissipation of the gravitational instability is balancing the imposed cooling.,width=302 ]     plotted against time for the simulation shown in figure [ fig : slice_10_1k ] .",
    "cooling is turned on at @xmath14 , after which there is a sudden burst . however , by @xmath16 the simulation has settled into a quasi - steady state with a roughly constant @xmath6 , consistent with what is expected from energy balance ( dashed line).,width=321 ]    other studies employing different types of numerical methods , such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics @xcite and grid - based methods @xcite , have similarly shown that a self - gravitating disc will tend to settle to a quasi - steady state in which @xmath0 is close to unity and in which angular momentum transport can be described using an @xmath6-formalism in which @xmath6 is given by equation ( [ eq : alpha_gammie ] ) .",
    "there are , however , some caveats to the above that we will discuss in more detail later .",
    "it applies in situations where the disc mass is low enough that the local approximation is valid , and also requires that the cooling time is not so short that the instability becomes non - linear and the disc breaks up into fragments .",
    "a fundamental assumption in some of the early work on the evolution of self - gravitating discs ( e.g. , @xcite ) was that there was only a single heating source ; dissipation of the gravitational instabilty .",
    "in such a scenario , the cooling balances only this heating source and the effective @xmath6 is given simply by equation ( [ eq : alpha_gammie ] ) .",
    "in the presence of an additional heating source ( such as external irradiation ) it is more complex , since - in a state of marginal stability - the cooling balances both heating due to the instability and the additional heating source .    for a given cooling time",
    ", the effective @xmath6 is reduced in the presence of an additional heating source , compared to a situation where the only heating source is the gravitational instability itself .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that , in the presence of external irradiation , one can approximate the effective @xmath6 using @xmath17 where @xmath4 is the local surface density , @xmath18 is the sound speed to which the disc would settle in the presence of external irradiation only , and @xmath2 is the sound speed to which the disc settles if it does tend to a state of marginal stability .",
    "this is similar to the form suggested by @xcite .",
    "this can then be recast as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath0 value to which it would settle in the presence of external irradiation only , while @xmath21 is the saturated @xmath0 value to which the disc settles in the presence of both the external irradiation and heating through dissipating the gravitational instability . using shearing sheet simulations",
    ", @xcite showed that this relationship is indeed reasonable , and the results are illustrated in figure [ fig : alpha_qirr ] ( from @xcite ) which shows how the effective @xmath6 varies with increasing levels of external irradiation , when the underlying cooling timescale is @xmath22 .",
    "value varies with the level external irradiation ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the triangles are an initial semi - analytic estimate , while the diamonds with error bars are from the shearing sheet simulations .",
    "although there is some discrepancy , it s clear that the effective @xmath6 decreases with increasing levels of external irradiation.,width=321 ]    the important point here is that if there are other sources of heating , the strength of the instability is not set by the cooling timescale , @xmath8 , alone . in the presence of other heating sources , the strength of the instability , and the magnitude of @xmath6 , will be smaller than if the only heating source is the gravitational instability .",
    "another assumption underlying the idea that angular momentum transport via the graviational instability can be treated as essentially viscous , is that the shear stress ( or , equivalently , the viscous @xmath6 ) depends primarily on the local conditions in the disc .",
    "gravity is , however , inherently global , and so such an assumption is nt strictly correct . @xcite",
    "have shown that the energy equation for a self - gravitating disc has extra terms associated with global wave transport .",
    "they do , however , suggest that self - gravitating discs that hover near marginal gravitational stability may behave in a manner that is well described by a local @xmath6 model .",
    "early global simulations @xcite seemed to indicate that simple @xmath6 models could reproduce the density evolution of self - gravitating accretion discs .",
    "such simulations , however , initially ignored heating and cooling processes in the disc , which play a fundamental role in setting the quasi - steady nature of such systems @xcite . imposing a @xmath8-cooling formalism in global disc simulations , @xcite illustrated that quasi - steady , self - gravitating discs do indeed behave like @xmath6 discs and that the local model is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the local nature of self - gravitating angular momentum transport does , however , depend on the mass of the disc relative to the mass of the central object . as the disc - to - star mass ratio increases",
    ", the disc becomes thicker and global effects are likely to become more important .",
    "@xcite only considered discs that had masses less than one quarter the mass of the central star .",
    "later work @xcite considered much higher mass ratios .",
    "what was found was that as the disc - to - star mass ratio increases , lower - order spiral modes start to dominate .",
    "for mass ratios of @xmath23 , a transient @xmath24 spiral develops that rapidly redistributes mass and then allows the disc settle into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state . for mass ratios approaching unity",
    ", however , the disc never seems to settle into some kind of quasi - steady , self - regulated state .",
    "however , it does appear to satisfy the basic criteria in a time - averaged sense .",
    "the basic picture therefore appears to be that for mass ratios below @xmath23 a self - gravitating disc will rapidly settle into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state in which @xmath25 , heating and cooling are in balance , and in which angular momentum transport is pseudo - viscous and can be described by an effective @xmath6 . as the mass ratio increases , lower @xmath26-modes begin to dominate , producing global spiral density waves that either rapidly redistibute mass , allowing the disc to then settle into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state , or - for sufficiently high mass ratios - that have time varying amplitudes leading to the disc only being quasi - steady in a time averaged sense .",
    "a great deal of work on the evolution of self - gravitating accretion discs has used the basic @xmath8-formalism when implementing cooling .",
    "this , however , is clearly not a realistic representation of how such discs will actually cool , and was never intended to be so .",
    "it is simply a basic way in which to represent cooling so as to investigate how such discs evolve under a range of different cooling scenarios .",
    "it s clear that in reality , a self - gravitating disc will not have a cooling function that can be described via a single @xmath8 parameter @xcite and that the actual evolution may depend on the form of the cooling function @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have indeed used more realistic cooling formalisms .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite used simulations with radiative transfer to understand the fragmentation of self - gravitating discs , @xcite considered how the disc metallicity might influence its evolution , @xcite considered the quasi - steady evolution of discs with realistic cooling and realistic opacities , and @xcite probed the parameter space where disc fragmentation may occur , using three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative transfer .",
    "more recently @xcite also considered the evolution of self - gravitating discs using a more realistic cooling formalism , but with the goal of trying to understand its quasi - steady evolution and , in particular , if the local approximation still applies when the cooling is more realistic .",
    "they performed three - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations of discs around young stars in which a radiative transfer formalism @xcite was used to estimate how the disc cooled .",
    "their results suggest that for discs with masses below about half that of the central star , the general behaviour is well described by the local approximation .",
    "an estimate of the local cooling time , when @xmath25 , can be used to determine the local value of @xmath6 .",
    "however , as the mass ratio inceases , the behaviour becomes more global , and the local cooling time is not a good indicator of the effective @xmath6 , except in a time - averaged sense .",
    "given the above , it is possible to use semi - analytic calculations to determine the realistic structure of quasi - steady , self - gravitating accretion discs @xcite , at least for those with masses less than about half that of the central star .",
    "for example , for a given opacity one can determine the cooling rate for a given surface density and , hence , the local effective viscosity ( @xmath6 ) . using standard one - dimensional accretion disc models @xcite one",
    "can then determine the surface density profile for a disc accreting at a specified accretion rate .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : quasi - steady - sdens ] shows the surface density profile of a quasi - steady , self - gravitating disc around a 1 m@xmath27 star accreting at @xmath28 m@xmath27/year ( solid line ) and accreting at @xmath29 m@xmath27/year ( dashed line ) , for standard opacities @xcite and in the absence of external irradiation .",
    "given the opacities , the profile is essentially unique for a specific mass accretion rate .",
    "what figure [ fig : quasi - steady - sdens ] also shows is that there is quite a strong mass dependence . assuming an outer disc radius of 100 au , the disc mass of the disc accreting at @xmath28 m@xmath27/year is @xmath30 m@xmath27 , while that of the disc accreting at @xmath29 m@xmath27/year is @xmath31 m@xmath27 .",
    "less than a factor of two change in disc mass , produces about an order of magnitude change in accretion rate .",
    "m@xmath27/year ( solid line ) and @xmath29 m@xmath27/year ( dashed line ) and the disc masses are @xmath30 m@xmath27 ( solid line ) and @xmath31 m@xmath27 ( dashed line ) .",
    "this illustrates that a relatively small change in disc mass can produce a substantial change in accretion rate , indicating that disc self - gravity is only likely to play an important role in angular momentum transport when these systems are very young , and the disc mass is relatively high.,width=321 ]    this has a number of consequences .",
    "to explain ttauri - like , and higher , accretion rates , self - gravitating discs need to be quite massive , relative to the mass of the central star .",
    "given that disc lifetimes are typically 5 myr , or less @xcite , self - gravity is unlikely to explain accretion rates during the later stages of a discs lifetime , since it would imply much longer lifetimes than those observed .",
    "similarly , observed spiral structures in protostellar discs are unlikely to be due to disc self - gravity unless the disc mass is still relatively high @xcite . for discs with masses",
    "less than @xmath32 m@xmath27 , the instability is likely to be weak , is unlikely to generate the stresses that can dominate the angular momentum transport process , and is unlikely to have spiral density waves that are sufficiently strong so as to be observable .",
    "the previous section focussed on the quasi - steady evolution of self - gravitating accretion discs . for",
    "sufficiently unstable discs , however , one possible outcome is that they fragment to form bound objects .",
    "it has been suggested that these could be protoplanets in discs around young stars @xcite , or protostars in discs around supermassive black holes @xcite .    again using shearing sheet simulations",
    ", @xcite showed that a disc will fragment if the cooling time is sufficiently fast ; in this case the fragmentation boundary being at @xmath33 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : slice_2_1k ] which shows the surface density structure in a shearing sheet simulation with @xmath34 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is clear that there are a number of dense clumps forming in the disc .     and",
    "there are a number of dense clumps , indicating that the rapid cooling in this simulation has lead to the disc fragmenting , rather than settling into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state.,width=302 ]    a similar fragmentation boundary was obtained using three - dimensional , global simulations @xcite .",
    "however , as equation ( [ eq : alpha_gammie ] ) shows , the effective @xmath6 depends on the specific heat capacity @xmath11 .",
    "consequently it was shown that the fragmentation boundary is actually set by a maximum @xmath6 that can be sustained in a quasi - steady , self - regulated disc , not by the cooling time specifically @xcite .",
    "for example , the cooling time for fragmentation if @xmath13 is smaller than for @xmath35 .    additionally , one has to be careful because all of this early work was done under the assumption that dissipation of the gravitational instability was the only heating source . as discussed above , the presence of external irradiation weakens the instability and reduces the effective @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore it is more reasonable to regard the fragmentation boundary as being associated with the maximum self - gravitating @xmath6 that a disc can sustain in a self - regulated , quasi - steady state , than as the minimum cooling time that can be imposed without the disc fragmenting .",
    "furthermore , the above analyses have all used simulations in which the local approximation is reasonably valid . as discussed above , as the disc becomes more massive ( relative to the mass of the central object ) global modes start to dominate , and the local approximations are only valid in a time averaged sense .",
    "when global modes start to dominate , it appears that a self - gravitating disc can sustain larger @xmath6 values without fragmenting , than would be expected based on the local approximation only @xcite .",
    "simulations of collapsing cloud cores with radiative transfer also indicate that the behaviour is quite different to what would be expected based on the local approximation @xcite .",
    "discs that do nt fragment can have @xmath6 values considerably higher than the local approximation would suggest is possible .",
    "as @xcite illustrates , however , the reynolds stress , driven by velocity shear from material from the infalling envelope contacting the disc , dominates , and the gravitational component of the stress still typically produces @xmath6 values less than 0.1 .      if we focus again on the case where the local approximation is valid , one way to understand fragmentation is to consider the relationship between @xmath6 and the perturbation amplitudes .",
    "@xcite show that the transport of energy and angular momentum , by the spiral waves driven by the gravitational instability , depends on the surface density perturbation @xmath36 . since the angular momentum transport can be described via an effective @xmath6 , which itself depends on the cooling timescale @xmath8 , @xcite",
    "show that the perturbation amplitudes depend on @xmath8 through @xmath37 similarly , you can cast this as @xcite @xmath38 figure [ fig : alpha_sigrms ] ( taken from @xcite ) shows a plot of time - averaged @xmath6 against @xmath39 illustrating that as @xmath6 increases the perturbation amplitudes increase .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha_sigrms ] also shows results from simulations with no external irradiation ( @xmath40 ) and with external irradiation ( @xmath41 ) illustrating that it is @xmath6 that determines the perturbation amplitudes , not simply the cooling time @xmath8 .     plotted against the mean perturbation amplitude @xmath42 , for a variety of different shearing sheet simulations .",
    "it s clear that there is a relationship between @xmath6 and the perturbation amplitudes , with the perturbation amplitudes increasing with increasing @xmath6 . in the absence of external irradiation ( @xmath40 ) , this would also indicate a relationship between the perturbation amplitudes and @xmath8 @xcite , but in the presence of external irradiation ( @xmath41 ) it is @xmath6 that sets the perturbation amplitude , not simply @xmath8 .",
    "( figure from @xcite.),width=321 ]    essentially , the basic picture is that as the self - gravitating @xmath6 increases , the perturbations become larger and , there will be an @xmath6 value beyond which the perturbations collapse and the disc fragments .",
    "most simulations suggest that this occurs at an @xmath6 value of about 0.06 @xcite , but this should probably not be seen as some kind of hard boundary , as we ll discuss in more detail later .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the fragmentation boundary does not converge to a fixed @xmath6 value as the numerical resolution of the simulation increases @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to explain this .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that numerical viscosity may play a larger role than previously thought ( e.g. , @xcite ) and that , consequently , simulations will need to consider higher resolutions than have been used in the past .",
    "@xcite show that the lack of convergence could be related to edge effects in simulations with very smooth initial conditions .",
    "this apparent non - convergence has , however , lead to a suggestion that fragmentation may occur for very long cooling times .",
    "@xcite do , however , extrapolate their results to suggest that they may be tending towards convergence and that the critical value may be around @xmath43 .    one issue with the idea that fragmentation could occur for very long cooling times is , however , based on our basic understanding of the underlying processes .",
    "as discussed above , in the absence of other heating sources , there is a relationship between cooling time and @xmath6 , such that as the cooling time gets longer , the effective @xmath6 value gets smaller .",
    "however , this also implies that the perturbation amplitudes get smaller .",
    "so , one issue would be how do discs fragment if the perturbations are tiny ?    also , if fragmentation at longer cooling times requires higher resolution , then it implies that this fragmentation is occuring on scales that are not resolved by the lower resolution simulations .",
    "however , the jeans mass / radius at @xmath25 is typically resolved in at least part of the simulation domains for these lower resolution simulations @xcite . this would suggest that at these longer cooling times , large amplitude , small - scale perturbations are driving @xmath44 and hence producing fragments that are unresolved in the lower resolution simulations . in shearing sheet simulations , however ,",
    "the power typically decreasing with increasing wavenumber , @xmath45 , as shown in figure [ fig : powerspec ] .",
    "the issue then becomes why at long cooling times fragmentation happens at scales where there is much less power than at the scales at which fragmentation occurs when the cooling time is short ?    .",
    "the length of each side of the sheet is @xmath46 , and so this figure shows that most of the power is at scales a few times smaller than the sheet size and that there is very little power at very small scales.,width=321 ]    consequently , @xcite , suggest that the effect is largely numerical and is related to the manner in which cooling has typically been implemented in sph simulations .",
    "more recently an sph simulation with 10 million particles and with a modified form of the standard @xmath8 cooling formalism , was shown not to fragment for @xmath12 @xcite , well below the values suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also considered convergence in a three - dimensional grid - based code and , although they did nt test for the fragmentation boundary specifically , they did find that simulations with @xmath47 typically did not fragment . hence it seems that it s important to be careful of how the cooling is implemented and to avoid implementations that may promote fragmentation .",
    "there has been some attempt to try and see if there is a physical explanation for this lack of convergence . in particular , is there evidence that simulations are suppressing fragmentation at small scales ?",
    "one possibility , suggested by @xcite , is that there are two modes of fragmentation .",
    "one mode operates at the free - fall time and requires rapid cooling .",
    "the other is a mode in which fragments form via quasi - static collapse and requires that these fragments then contract to a size where they can survive disruption by spiral shock waves .",
    "@xcite suggest that many two - dimensional simulations smooth gravity on the jeans scale , inhibiting contraction to smaller scales , and hence preventing this second mode from operating .",
    "however , they also show that even if this second mode does operate , it probably still requires relatively fast cooling ( @xmath48 ) , but with quite a large uncertainty .",
    "part of the motivation behind @xcite was a suggestion that turbulent discs are never stable against fragmentation @xcite and , in particular , that rare high - amplitude , small - scale fluctuations could lead to gravitational collapse .",
    "this suggestion , however , is not entirely consistent with what we re discussing here .",
    "the @xcite analysis considered discs that were typically assumed to be isothermal , essentially implying that @xmath49 .    also , the turbulence they were considering was not the gravito - turbulence driven by the instability itself .",
    "the standard analysis of self - gravitating discs considers a scenario in which the quasi - turbulent structures are a self - consistent response to the growth of the instability and depend - as discussed already - on the thermal balance in the disc .",
    "@xcite were considering a situation in which isothermal turbulence is present in a disc in which self - gravity might also operate .",
    "in fact , the presence of such turbulence - if the disc were non - isothermal - should act as an extra heating source , which would then be expected to reduce the magnitude of the gravitational instability , rather than enhance it @xcite .      even though the analysis in @xcite is not quite consistent with the basic picture presented here , it is still interesting from the perspective of whether or not fragmentation could be triggered .",
    "this could be via some other form of turbulence ( as suggested by @xcite ) or via some kind of external perturbation . some early work ( e.g. , @xcite ) suggested that stellar encounters could promote fragmentation .",
    "such early simulations typically , however , assumed an isothermal equation of state , which is known to promote fragmentation @xcite .",
    "later work suggested that the inclusion of compressive and shock heating @xcite would tend to prohibit encounter - driven fragmentation .",
    "this was further confirmed using simulations with a realistic radiative transfer formalism @xcite .",
    "the basic argument is that , typically , the encounter will compress the disc on a dynamical timescale , which is much shorter than the thermal timescale .",
    "consequently , the encounter would be expected to heat - and stablise - the disc , rather than produce fragmentation .",
    "fragmentation would only be expected to occur if the cooling time can be reduced by the compression @xcite .",
    "this may be possible if the temperature change pushes the gas into a regime where the opacity is reduced ( the opacity - gap ) .",
    "however , the corresponding increase in gas density tends to act in the opposite sense , and so this may still make triggered fragmentation unlikely @xcite .",
    "there has , however , been a recent suggestion @xcite that fragmentation in the inner parts of dics may be triggered by fragments that form , initially , in the outer parts of discs , and @xcite suggest that tidal encounters might trigger fragmentation in massive , extended protostellar discs . hence , there may be scenarios under which fragmentation could be triggered .",
    "@xcite have suggested that fragmentation may be stochastic .",
    "their basic argument is that a quasi - steady gravito - turbulent state consists of weak shocks and transient clumps that will contract on the cooling timescale ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "if such a clump can avoid being disrupted by one of the spiral shocks , then it could survive to become a bound fragment .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : alpha_stoch ] - taken from @xcite - shows the evolution of the maximum surface density ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath6 in a shearing sheet simulation in which the disc appears to initially settle into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state .",
    "this is illustrated by both the maximum density and @xmath6 settling to reasonably constant values , as indicated by the dashed line in the lower panel .",
    "however , at @xmath51 , @xmath6 starts to decrease and the maximum density increases to to a value a few hundred times greater than the initial value , @xmath52 .",
    "this indicates that this system has undergone fragmentation after first appearing to settle to a quasi - steady state , and may be indicative of stochasticity .",
    "@xcite find that transient clumps are present in all of their simulations ( up to @xmath53 ) but that fragmentation only actually happens up to @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite suggest that , given sufficient time , stochastic fragmentation may actually occur both if the cooling time is very long and the @xmath0 value is very high .",
    "however , as we suggest above , the scenario they re considering is nt quite the same as that being discussed here .",
    "- top panel ) and @xmath6 ( bottom panel ) against time , from a shearing sheet simulation that initially appears to have settled into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state .",
    "however , at @xmath51 , @xmath6 starts to decrease and the maximum surface density starts increasing , eventually reaching values many hundreds of times greater than it was initially .",
    "the system , which appeared to have settled into a quasi - steady state , has now undergone fragmentation and this may be indicative of stochasticity.,width=302 ]    @xcite argue that this stochasticity is consistent with the idea behind their suggestion that there are two modes of fragmentation @xcite . in discs with rapid cooling , fragmentation can occur on the free - fall time . in discs that are cooling slowly ( for example , @xmath55 ) , fragmentation can still occur if a clump can cool and contract prior to encountering a spiral shock .",
    "@xcite find that the wait time between shocks is not stongly dependent on the cooling time .",
    "given that clumps contract on the cooling timescale , this means that the likelihood of fragmentation decreases with increasing cooling time .",
    "they also find an exponential decay in the likelihood of a patch remaining unshocked , and so the probability of a transient clump contracting sufficiently so as to survive a shock encounter is effectively zero for very long cooling times . given this ,",
    "even if fragmentation is stochastic , this is unlikely to substantially change the conditions under which fragmentation actually occurs .",
    "similarly , @xcite impose a cooling implementation that attempts to incorporate optical depth effects , and find that this also appears to inhibit stochastic fragmentation .",
    "if we focus specifically on discs around young stars ( protostellar discs ) then we can determine where fragmentation could happen , and even if it does actually happen .",
    "it is likely that the inner regions of protostellar discs are optically thick and , consequently , have long cooling times .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : alpha_r ] which shows @xmath6 plotted against radius for a quasi - steady disc in which the cooling time at each radius is calculated using the actual optical depth , rather than by simply assuming some @xmath8-value _ a priori_. the @xmath6 values are extremely small in the inner disc but increase with increasing radius , reaching values where fragmentation may be possible in the outer parts of the disc . consequently , we expect fragmentation to only occur in the outer parts of such systems @xcite , beyond @xmath56 au .     against radius in a quasi - steady , self - gravitating disc with realistic cooling .",
    "the inner disc is optically thick , leading to long cooling times and very small @xmath6 values .",
    "the @xmath6 value increases with radius , reaching value where fragmentation might be possible in the outer parts of the disc .",
    "hence , we expect fragmentation to only be possible in the outer parts of protostellar accretion discs.,width=321 ]    even if fragmentation is stochastic , or can occur for longer cooling times than we currently think , this has little impact when it comes to fragmentation in protostellar discs .",
    "the radial dependence of the cooling time is very strong in the inner parts of these discs @xcite .",
    "even a factor of a few in the cooling time for fragmentation has little effect on where fragmentation likely happens @xcite .",
    "if the opacity is significantly lower than interstellar , then the fragmentation radius could to move towards the inner parts of the disc @xcite .",
    "however , it is still unlikely that fragmentation can take place inside @xmath57 au in such discs @xcite    in addition to where we might expect fragmentation to occur , we can also estimate typical fragment masses @xcite .",
    "typically , the initial fragment masses are a few jupiter masses . given that we expect fragmentation to only occur in the outer parts of protostellar discs , and to have initial masses of at least a few jupiter masses ,",
    "it s been suggested this could explain some of the directly imaged planets on wide orbits @xcite .",
    "it s also been suggested that in some cases such objects could rapidly spiral into the inner disc @xcite and could lose mass via tidal stripping @xcite .",
    "this could potentially then be the origin of some of the known exoplanets , even terrestrial / rocky exoplanets if the cores can survive disruption @xcite .",
    "if not , the disruption of an embryo could lead to the formation of planetesimal belts @xcite or change the overall disc chemistry @xcite . in some cases , however , it may be possible for the protoplanet to open a gap and survive @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , argue that typically fragments are either destroyed , or remain at large radii with relatively high masses ( many jupiter masses ) .",
    "according to their analysis , the formation of planetesimal belts or terrestrial planets via this mechanism is also rare .",
    "the high destruction rate , however , is consistent with other simulations @xcite and could lead to outbursts , such as the fu orionis phenomenon @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , suggest that a large fraction of the clumps could survive inward migration and that such a process could explain a reasonable fraction of the known population of ` hot ' jupiters and other gas giant planets .",
    "in addition to the rapid inspiral of fragments , it s also possible that objects forming via fragmentation at large radii could be scattered by stellar , or other , companions @xcite .",
    "some of these could then be circularised onto a short - period orbit , via tidal interactions with the parent star @xcite , producing either a ` hot ' jupiter or a proto - hot jupiter @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , argue that the population of known ` hot ' and proto - hot jupiters is inconsistent with this being common and suggests that disc fragmentation rarely forms planetary - mass objects .",
    "this is also consistent with the relatively low frequency of known wide orbit planetary and brown dwarf companions @xcite .",
    "we ve tried here to summarise our current understanding of the evolution of self - gravitating accretion discs , focusing - in particular - on those around youngs protostars .",
    "when self - gravity is important , we expect such discs to either settle into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state in which heating and cooling are in balance and @xmath25 @xcite , or - if the instability is particularly strong - to fragment to form bound objects .",
    "typically the boundary between a disc fragmenting , or settling into a quasi - steady state , is determined by the rate at which it is losing energy , with rapid cooling potentially leading to fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the exact boundary does , however , depend on whether or not there is an additional heating source @xcite , and on the mass of the disc relative to the mass of the central object ; due to the global nature of the gravitational instability @xcite , very massive discs may avoid fragmentation under conditions that may lead to fragmentation in less massive discs @xcite .",
    "similarly , very massive discs may not settle into a true quasi - steady , self - regulated state , but instead show variability , and are only quasi - steady in a time averaged sense .",
    "it is also possible that fragmentation itself is stochastic and could , at times , occur for longer cooling times than this basic analysis suggests @xcite .    in protostellar discs , however , the exact fragmentation boundary is not that relevant when it comes to determining where fragmentation might happen .",
    "the inner parts of such discs are so optically thick , and cool so slowly , that fragmentation is only actually likely in the outer parts of these discs @xcite . even if fragmentation could occur for slightly longer cooling times than originally thought , or if fragmentation is stochastic , this is unlikely to significantly influence where fragmentation can occur @xcite .",
    "although , reductions in opacity can bring the fragmentation region closer to the central star @xcite , it s still unlikely close to the central star . essentially , it is very difficult for there to be conditions such that fragmentation could occur inside @xmath58 au .",
    "there are , however , still aspects that are uncertain .",
    "it might seem that the lack of convergence in self - gravitating disc simulations @xcite is most likely numerical @xcite , but this is still not fully resolved .",
    "similarly , there is evidence for stochasticity @xcite and a potential explanation for this @xcite , but there are still aspects of this that are uncertain .",
    "however , our basic understanding seems robust .",
    "self - gravitating discs will tend to settle into a quasi - steady , self - regulated state in which heating balances cooling , in which the transport of angular momentum can be described as pseudo - viscous @xcite , and in which the amplitude of the perturbations depends on the magnitude of the effective viscosity @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "if the perturbations become very large , then the disc may undergo fragmentation .",
    "it s also unclear as to whether or not fragmentation ever actually occurs in protostellar discs .",
    "there are suggestions @xcite that it may explain some of the directly imaged exoplanets on wide - orbits @xcite and suggestions that some may spiral inwards to smaller orbital radii than where they form @xcite . on the other hand , the paucity of directly imaged planets on wide - orbits @xcite and the properties of the known closer - in exoplanets",
    ", suggests that disc fragmentation may rarely form planetary - mass objects @xcite",
    ".    however , disc self - gravity may still play a crucial role in angular momentum transport during the earliest stages of star formation , and the resulting density waves may then play a role in the growth of planet building material @xcite .",
    "so , even if the gravitational instability does not play a significant role in forming planets directly , it may still play an important role in the growth of the building blocks crucial for planet formation .",
