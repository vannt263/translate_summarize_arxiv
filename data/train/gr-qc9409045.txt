    "gravitational collapse with formation of black holes is one of the main problems of general relativity .",
    "choptuik @xcite discovered a critical behavior of the gravitational collapse of massless scalar field by a numerical study .",
    "his result can be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be one - parameter families of solutions of einstein s equations for spherically symmetric massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravitational field , where @xmath1 is a parameter which smoothly specifies the initial value of the scalar and gravitational fields and @xmath2 is an index which specifies one of the several one - parameter families . for each family",
    "@xmath3 there is a critical value @xmath4 of the parameter @xmath1 such that solutions @xmath5 contain a black hole while @xmath6 do not , which are referred to as supercritical and subcritical , respectively .",
    "he found that near-  solutions satisfy the following : ( 1 ) the strong field region is universal in the sense that it approaches the identical spacetime for all families ( for all @xmath2 ) , ( 2 ) the strong field region has a discrete self similarity , and ( 3 ) for  solutions the  mass is proportional to a certain power of the deviation of the parameter @xmath1 from the  value @xmath4 as @xmath7 and the  exponent @xmath8 is universal , independent of @xmath2 . the numerical value of the @xmath8 was given as @xmath9 , and was speculated to be @xmath10 .",
    "abrahams and evans @xcite found the similar phenomena in axisymmetric collapse of gravitational wave with almost the same value of the  exponent @xmath11 .",
    "evans and coleman @xcite also found the similar phenomena with @xmath12 in spherically symmetric collapse of radiation fluid , in which case the self similarity is not discrete but local one .",
    "the difference seems to come from that in the first two cases the matter propagates as waves while in the last case it does not .",
    "there might be some typical wavelength in the first two cases .",
    "it should be noted that these calculations may suggest that the meaning of the universality in ( 3 ) can be extended to independence of the critical exponent from details of systems , though in the first suggestion it meant its independence of initial data .",
    "the phenomena described above are very striking , but there are almost no theoretical account for the essense of them , especially for the value of the critical exponent @xmath8 and the mechanism to accquire the self similarity and the universality .",
    "oshiro , nakamura and tomimatsu @xcite , husain , martinez , and nunez @xcite , and brady@xcite studied the critical behavior of scalar field collapse using the exact self - similar solution .",
    "they gave the the critical exponent @xmath13 .",
    "their argument on @xmath8 was not very quantitative , which was mostly due to the difficulty of estimating the form of the metric in the asymptotic region .",
    "if the critical behavior has very universal feature we may expect the similar behavior in seemingly very different models , which may enable us to investigate it in a simple model . on the other hand",
    ", the model should have some essential properties which the above models have in common .",
    "first , the spacetime should be asymptotically flat .",
    "second , there must be energy transportation to the null infinity .",
    "this is because otherwise the spacetime necessarily ends up with a black hole with the mass of the initially prepared matter whenever a black hole forms ( apart from the possibility that a star forms outside a black hole of small mass ) so that there would be no criticality , which is the case of the lemaitre  tolman",
    " bondi spacetimes .",
    "third , the matter content was `` massless '' in all of the above numerical studies .",
    "it is preferable that our model should also have the similar property .",
    "a simple model possessing these properties is the collapse of a thin shell coupled with outgoing null flux .",
    "we will find such a model which exhibits the critical behavior in  formation .",
    "we treat it analytically , which may help find the mechanism of the critical behavior .",
    "we shall find the critical exponent and its dependence on the details of the systems .",

    "let @xmath14 be a compact 2-surface which represents the thin shell .",
    "the shell s trajectory is given by two embedding of @xmath15 into the _ exterior _ and the _ interior _ spacetimes @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are supposed to be the solution of einstein s equation .",

    "let us look at the qualitative behavior of the shell and search models which exhibits a critical behavior in the  formation .",
    "first we assume that there is some mechanism to prevent negative flux to emit from the shell and the shell will be static after then .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ee1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ee2 - 2 ] ) and @xmath74 that the orbit of the shell outside the event horizon ( @xmath75 ) is given by a first order ordinary differential equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "one immediately finds in the above equation that the value of @xmath65 , which is one of the parameters specifying the initial condition , is irrelevant to the qualitative behavior of the shell , , the motion of the shell is scale invariant .",
    "this is another feature which our model has in common with the case of spherically symmetric scalar field collapse .",
    "the set @xmath78 of turning points ( boundary of the forbidden region ) in the @xmath79-@xmath80 diagram is given by the points at which @xmath81 . from eq .",

    "further , it coincides with the event horizon for the outgoing vaidya spacetime . one can easily check that @xmath84 is tangent to @xmath78 ( if @xmath86 ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath78 depends on the sign of @xmath64 , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "if @xmath87 then @xmath78 passes the origin and the mass of the shell is bounded from below to be positive . if @xmath88 the mass is not bounded from below .",
    "this implies that the mass of the shell can be negative at @xmath89 , which may suggest that a naked singularity occurs .",
    "we shall not concern the critical point between black hole and naked singularity here and assume that @xmath64 is positive .",
    "the initial condition @xmath90 can be given in the region between @xmath84 and @xmath78 with @xmath91 , which we will call region i , if the shell is not contained in a black hole from the beginning .",
    "one would like to consider the situation in which the shell s energy is carried away to infinity during the collapse .",
    "we therefore require that the mass decreases when the shell is collapsing .",
    "this is given by the condition @xmath92 because in region i we always have @xmath93 .",
    "then a collapsing shell has only three possibilities : it will hit ( 1 ) @xmath94 , ( 2 ) @xmath95 , or ( 3 ) the origin .",
    "the case ( 1 ) implies that there is a formation of a ; the solution is supercritical .",
    "since the local gravitational mass is constant along the outgoing null line , the mass @xmath96 of the black hole , which is given by the limit of the bondi mass to the future timelike infinity @xmath97 , is given by the mass of the shell crossing the event horizon @xmath84 .",
    "the case ( 2 ) implies that the shell reaches the turning point and expands .",
    "but eq . ( [ eq : orbit ] ) implies that negative flux emerges when it expands so that the shell will stay at the turning point .",
    "the solution is subcritical .",
    "if both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are possible there may be a solution of the case ( 3 ) , which should give the critical point .",
    "whether each case really occurs can be examined by using the gradient @xmath98 given by ( [ eq : orbit ] ) .",
    "on @xmath84 one has @xmath99 , which implies that solutions always exist .",
    "the gradient is always positive in region i and negative outside region i. therefore , the shell loses / gains mass before / after it cross the event horizon . in region",
    "i the gradient monotonically increases when the point is going down to @xmath78 along the constant @xmath80 line , because the partial derivative of the right hand side of ( [ eq : orbit ] ) by @xmath79 is always negative in region i. for each point of @xmath84 , one can check whether there is a solution with decreasing @xmath80 which hits it by comparing the gradient of the solution and that of the line @xmath78 .",
    "the difference is given by @xmath100 the point at which this is positive ( negative ) is the turning point from contraction to expansion ( expansion to contraction ) .",
    "one finds that it changes sign once from positive to negative at @xmath101 in @xmath102 if @xmath103 , and it is always negative otherwise .",
    "this implies that solutions of the above case ( 2 ) certainly exists if and only if @xmath61 is positive . combining these conditions",
    ", we find that the critical point exists if and only if the both of @xmath61 and @xmath64 are positive .",
    "a few remarks are now in order .",
    "first , the condition @xmath103 implies that the intrinsic force of the shell is not tension but pressure .",
    "this is a reasonable condition for the collapsing shell to expand .",
    "second , all solutions with decreasing @xmath80 has its `` starting point '' on @xmath78 where @xmath104 .",
    "the `` terminal point '' is either on @xmath84 or on @xmath78 with @xmath105 .",
    "third , the point @xmath106 on @xmath78 is the solution of the static shell .",
    "the critical solution @xmath107 ( [ eq : orbit ] ) is the one which passes the origin .",
    "it is easily found that @xmath108 , in particular , the critical solution is tangent to @xmath78 at the origin .",
    "as already said , the  mass @xmath109 is given by the value of @xmath79 at the intersecting point of the solution and @xmath85 .",
    "the penrose diagrams of the future half of each case are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the critical solution",
    "the asymptotic behavior @xmath110 implies that the invariant @xmath111 diverges when the shell shrink to @xmath112 if @xmath113 , while it is finite if @xmath114 .",
    "the former case can be interpreted that the shell collapsed to a naked singularity in the center , while the latter that the shell evaporated . in both cases",
    "the curvature is always continuous in @xmath115 .",
    "in this section we consider the motion of the shell in some datail and obtain approximate solutions by an intuitive argument . we shall calculate the critical exponent by using them .",
    "we shall give a more rigorous argument in the next section .",
    "we change variables for easier manipulation of the differential equation ( [ eq : orbit ] ) by @xmath116 eq .",

    "we look for the value @xmath137 in the following .",
    "let us devide region i into two , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , with @xmath140 being a small positive constant .",
    "we will call the first region the _ linear ( deviation ) region_. in the linear region , a small deviation from the critical solution is always linear , @xmath141 it is because in @xmath142 the rate of change of the gradient , @xmath143 , is bounded so that the deviation vector is always finite .",
    "it follows that nonlinearity of the deviation of the bondi mass from the critical solution emerges only near @xmath144 .",

    "finds @xmath158 setting @xmath159 one has @xmath160 where one sees that the power is determined by the power of the term between the vertical lines in ( [ eq : f0 ] ) . from eqs .",

    "it is remarkable that in our model the critical exponent @xmath8 is dependent on the constants @xmath61 and @xmath64 specifying the system .",
    "the exponent @xmath8 can take the values in the range @xmath266 for @xmath103 and @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests that the critical exponent is not so universal in the extended sense in sec .",
    ". there may be many different _ universality classes _ , and the critical exponent @xmath8 may serve as an index specifying them .    there will be a question why the numerically calculated cases seem to fall into the same universality class with @xmath267 , even if we admit the existence of many universal classes . one may think that the massless property of the matter is crucial . in our case , even if we require that the shell consists of radiation fluid having a trace free equation of state , @xmath268 , then @xmath8 is equal to @xmath269 and can not exceed @xmath270 .",
    "this may suggest that the massless property is not so important .",
    "another possibility is that self - similarity is crucial .",
    "a support for this possibility is that the critical solution in our model does not have spacetime self - similarity . if the near - critical solutions necessarily fall into a self - similar spacetime in the systems with",
    "_ smoothly _ distributed matter , then types of self - similar spacetimes may determine the universality classes .",
    "the universality in the initial value is not verified in our model because the solutions are parametrized by a single parameter @xmath271 ( or @xmath272 ) , apart from an irrelevant parameter @xmath65 . in our model , as said above , the nonlinearity of the deviation of the mass from the  solution emerges only near the event horizon .",
    "if the situations are similar in the numerically investigated collapses , the universality in initial data can be naturally understood .",
    "namely , almost all modes or fluctuations in initial data damp away so that the spacetime fall into a unique one by the time that the event horizon forms , and the critical exponent depends only on that final portion of the spacetime .",
    "this may also explain the universality in the extended sense if the spacetimes fall into the same one in the last stage of the collapse in several different systems .    to understand the universality it may be instructive to parametrize the solution space differently , for example , @xmath273 and @xmath274",
    ". then the critical exponent is , of course , the same for the both parameters . in this point of view",
    ", one can say that the universality on initial data is verified in our model and that the choice of the parameters @xmath275 and @xmath65 was good one in the sense that it separates the _ relevant _ and the _ irrelevant mode _ to the criticality . in more realistic collapses , where there are many degrees of freedom , it is expected that there is one ( or a few ) relevant mode corresponding to @xmath275 and are lots of irrelevant modes corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "we remark that our model has a peculiarity that if we do not assume some mechanism to protect the energy condition and allow negative flux , the subcritical solutions will have a reexpansion of the shell and a formation of a black holes of finite mass @xcite .",
    "though the above assumption seems somewhat artificial , we believe that in more natural models the mechanism of the emergence of nonlinearity is similar to that of the model presented here .",
    "some authors have argued black hole evaporation by imitating the spacetimes with the vaidya spacetime or one with classical scalar field ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if these point of view have something in common with the real machanism , some critical phenomena may be found in black hole evaporation and would be the key to understand such spacetimes .",
