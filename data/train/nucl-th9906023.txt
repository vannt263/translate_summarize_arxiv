    "the periodic orbit theory ( pot ) , developed by gutzwiller  @xcite for chaotic systems , by balian and bloch  @xcite for cavities , and by berry and tabor  @xcite for integrable systems , has proved to be an important semiclassical tool not only for an approximate quantization , but also for the description of gross - shell effects in finite fermion systems  @xcite .",
    "gutzwiller s approach has been extended to take into account continuous symmetries  @xcite and is therefore applicable to systems with mixed classical dynamics , including the integrable and hard - chaos limits .",
    "an important role is played by the classical degeneracy of the periodic orbits in systems with continuous spatial or dynamical symmetries : the orbits are then not isolated in phase space ( as it was assumed in gutzwiller s original trace formula , and as is the case in chaotic systems ) , but occur in degenerate families with identical actions .",
    "the degree of degeneracy @xmath0 is defined as the number of independent parameters which are necessary to uniquely specify an orbit within each family .",
    "e.g. , the orbit families with the highest degeneracy in spherical systems with spatial @xmath1 symmetry have @xmath2 , corresponding to the three euler angles that specify the orientation of an orbit within the plane of motion and the orientation of the plane itself ; the orbit families in two - dimensional systems with @xmath3 rotational symmetry have @xmath4 ; the isotropic harmonic oscillator in 2 dimensions has @xmath5 symmetry and hence orbit families with @xmath6 .",
    "orbits with different degeneracies @xmath0 may also occur in one and the same system , such as the spherical cavity discussed by balian and bloch  @xcite where the diameter orbit has @xmath6 and all other orbits have @xmath7 ; the spheroidal cavity  @xcite where @xmath6 , 1 or 0 occurs ( the latter corresponding to isolated orbits ) ; or the elliptic billiard with @xmath4 or 0 , as discussed in the present paper .",
    "however , problems arise for all these trace formulae in connection with the breaking of a continuous symmetry and with the bifurcation of stable periodic orbits when a continuous parameter ( energy , deformation , external field ) is varied .",
    "the reason is that at such critical points the standard stationary phase approximation , used for integrations in the derivation of the trace formula , breaks down and leads to divergences and/or discontinuities of the amplitudes in the trace formula .",
    "this happens most frequently in mixed systems , but it occurs also in integrable systems .",
    "typical examples are the two - dimensional elliptic billiard and the three - dimensional spheroidal cavity . in the former ,",
    "all repetitions of the short diameter orbits undergo bifurcations at specific deformations , whereby new families of hyperbolic orbits are created . similarly in the latter system , the periodic orbits lying in the equatorial plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis bifurcate also at specific deformations , whereby new 3-dimensional orbits appear  @xcite . in both systems ,",
    "all bifurcations and the limit to the spherical shape lead to divergent amplitudes in the trace formulae , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "since for each family with a given value of @xmath0 , the extended gutzwiller trace formula  @xcite has an amplitude proportional to @xmath8 , it is evident that the breaking of a continuous symmetry must be accompanied by a discontinuous change of the amplitudes , which manifests itself in the form of a singularity when one attempts to reach the unbroken symmetry limit .",
    "( an exceptional situation occurs in anisotropic harmonic oscillators when changing from irrational to rational frequency ratios : here the divergences of the different periodic orbit contributions have been shown  @xcite to cancel identically , such that the trace formulae  which are quantum - mechanically exact here  hold for arbitrary frequency ratios , although their analytical form changes in the different limits ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite . )    since symmetry breaking and orbit bifurcations occur in almost all realistic physical systems , there is a definite need to overcome these singularities .",
    "the importance of bifurcation effects in connection with the emergence of the ` superdeformed ' shell structure in atomic nuclei was emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to improve the pot in these critical situations ,",
    "various methods have been proposed .",
    "like in the treatment of continuous symmetries considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , they essentially consist in taking some integrals in the derivation of the trace formula more exactly than by the standard stationary phase method ( spm ) .    berry and tabor suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite a quite general method to treat bifurcations in integrable systems .",
    "starting from the trace integral for the level density in action - angle variables , they reduce it to the poisson - sum trace formula and do all trace integrations except one by the spm , extending the integration limits from @xmath9 to @xmath10 . at bifurcations",
    ", this leads to singularities in the amplitudes when the stationary points are close to the limits of the integration range .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in this case one has to take the integral within the exact finite range .",
    "the integration range need not necessarily include the stationary points ( in the case of negative or complex stationary points ) , but the latter are assumed to be close to the integration limits . for integrable systems , this idea was applied to the periodic - orbit families with the highest degeneracies , for which one can exactly carry out the integrals over the action angles , giving @xmath11 for each degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "this was the starting point of a uniform approximation that was further developed by various authors  @xcite .",
    "another type of uniform approximation was initiated by ozorio de almeida and hannay  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and further developed by sieber and schomerus  @xcite for various generic types of bifurcations . writing the trace integral in a phase - space representation , they expand the action around the bifurcation points into so - called normal forms which usually can be integrated analytically with finite results .",
    "the correct asymptotic recovery of the gutzwiller amplitudes far from the bifurcation points can be obtained by a suitable mapping transformation whereby the amplitude function , together with the jacobian of the mapping transformation , is expanded up to an order consistent with that of the action in the exponent of the integrand . near the bifurcation points , there is a common contribution of all participating ( real or complex , so - called ` ghost ' ) orbits to the trace formula .    a similar technique , starting from the berry - tabor approach for integrable systems and using a ` pendulum mapping ' , was used by tomsovic , grinberg and ullmo  @xcite to derive a generic uniform approximation for the breaking of orbit families with a one - dimensional degeneracy , corresponding to @xmath3 symmetry , into pairs of stable and unstable isolated orbits .",
    "finally , some analytical uniform trace formulae for the breaking of the higher - dimensional @xmath5 and @xmath1 symmetries in specific two- and three - dimensional systems have been derived very recently  @xcite .",
    "hereby the trace integral was performed over the de haar measure of the corresponding symmetry groups , as in the derivation of the unperturbed trace formulae for these continuous symmetries ,  @xcite and the mapping was done onto the forms of the action integrals obtained in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that all the uniform approximations mentioned above can be used only for one isolated critical point of symmetry breaking or orbit bifurcation : they fail , in particular ,  @xcite when two critical points are so close that the actions of the participating orbits at these points differ by less than @xmath12 . to our knowledge ,",
    "no common uniform treatment of two nearby bifurcations ( in the above sense ) , or of a bifurcation near a symmetry - breaking point , has been reported so far .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an approach to simultaneously overcome the divergences due to symmetry breaking and any number of bifurcations in the two - dimensional elliptic billiard and the three - dimensional spheroidal cavity .",
    "although our framework is quite general , we limit here its application to the elliptic billiard .",
    "the three - dimensional spheroidal cavity will be treated in a succeeding paper ,  @xcite and the extension to non - integrable systems is planned for future research .",
    "we start from a phase - space trace formula ,  @xcite which after some transformations becomes identical to that obtained from the mixed phase - space representation of the green function in refs .",
    "@xcite , as explained there and further below in this paper ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "analogous versions of the phase - space trace formulae were suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous investigations ,  @xcite we calculate the integrals over angles , too , by the stationary phase method .",
    "note that we also include orbits with lower degeneracies , such as the isolated diameters in the elliptic billiard and the equatorial orbits in the spheroidal cavity , hereby extending the method of ref .",
    "our main point is that the stationary - phase integrals over both action and angle variables are calculated with expansions of the phase and amplitudes like in the standard spm , but within _ finite _ intervals in all cases where it would lead to divergences if one or both integration limits were taken to @xmath13 or @xmath9 .",
    "we will also discuss the role of non - periodic closed orbits ( see  5.4 ) .",
    "for the maslov indices , which for the bifurcating orbits depend on the deformation and near the critical points also on the energy , we follow the basic ideas of maslov and fedoryuk  @xcite .",
    "we obtain separate contributions to the trace formula from the bifurcating periodic orbits , and we remove the singularity of the isolated long diameter ( i.e. , the separatrix ) near the circular shape of the elliptic billiard in a simpler way than in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this way",
    "we obtain an analytical trace formula for the elliptic billiard which gives finite and continuous contributions at all deformations , including the circular disk limit and all bifurcation points of the short diameter orbit .",
    "although its derivation and its explicit form are quite different , our final trace formula is similar to the uniform approximations mentioned above in the sense that it connects smoothly to the standard ( extended ) gutzwiller trace formulae for the different orbit types for deformations sufficiently far away from all critical points .",

    "( consequently , the momentum components are not independent , which is important for the following application of the stationary phase method ; see more details in the next subsection and in  4 . ) due to energy conservation , i.e. , @xmath40 , the trace formula ( [ pstrace ] ) can be rewritten in an alternative form where the integration variables are changed from ( @xmath41 ) to ( @xmath42 ) .",

    "all stationary points which appear outside the physical region of the integration over the phase - space variables are also taken into account , even if they are complex . in this way",
    "we get simple and continuous analytical solutions that stay finite at all critical ( bifurcation and symmetry - breaking ) points .",
    "different from other uniform approximations mentioned in the introduction , our results appear as explicit sums over separate contributions that correspond to the periodic orbits in the asymptotic regions away from the critical points .",
