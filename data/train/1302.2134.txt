    "the strength of the magnetic field tentatively detected in oh127 is comparable in magnitude with that estimated for other stellar oh maser sources ( @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is an order of magnitude higher than that measured from single dish high resolution spectra of several oh / ir objects @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to spatial blending of individual maser clumps in the envelopes and is confirmed for oh127 : our nrt 1612-mhz spectra in the velocity range of @xmath166.6 to @xmath164.5kms@xmath5 contain features with m@xmath885% while the merlin maps show highly ( up to 38% ) polarized components ( tab . [ circular ] ) .",
    "the presence of magnetic field in the outer envelope of oh127 is implied by the net polarization observed in both oh transitions .",
    "specifically , the source shows a strong excess of lhc emission well seen in the nrt spectra and merlin maps ( figs .",
    "[ spectr1612 ] @xmath1 [ map1667 ] )",
    ". enhancing one sense of circular polarization and inhibiting the other can be explained by the overlap of different zeeman components due to a velocity gradient within the medium @xcite or matching the gradients of the magnetic field and velocity @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism may be less probable in a thin circumstellar shell .",
    "a simple model of dipole magnetic field with an adapted cook s mechanism was successful in explaining the spatial segregation of the 1612-mhz spots dominated by the two senses of circular polarization in the supergiant star vxsgr @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that cook s mechanism could also partly explain the distribution of the 1612-mhz maser polarized components of oh127 ( see fig .",
    "[ map1612 ] ) by adopting a scenario inspired from zell & fix s fig .",
    "4 but with dipole field lines stretched in the radial direction and a different inclination of the dipole axis to the line of sight .",
    "at a distance of 5350au from the star a radial magnetic field or a field with open lines can occur . in the first case",
    "the outflow velocity gradient can combine with the zeeman pair to produce a coherence length of maser amplification longer for lhc component than for rhc component at the near and far sides of the envelope , i.e. the blue- and red - shifted parts of the spectrum are dominated by lhc emission . if the field with open lines or of interstellar origin is oriented towards the observer , as shown by our observations , then the masers from the near and far sides of the envelope will be dominated by lhc and rhc emission , respectively .",
    "this scenario is not fully consistent with our data where the red wing shows positive and negative values of @xmath57 at 1612mhz and only negative values at 1667mhz .",
    "oh127 at 1612mhz shows very small differences in the polarization angles at the near and far sides of the shell , suggesting a regular configuration of the magnetic field .",
    "such a phenomenon was observed in other oh / ir objects and two explanations are proposed in @xcite : ( 1 ) the field is of stellar origin and the same orientation of the field is carried away by the wind flowing towards the near and back sides of the shell , ( 2 ) the field is of interstellar origin and can be amplified and/or distorted by the stellar wind .    in the first case",
    "the field of 0.6 mg strength of solar type ( @xmath89 ) gives a surface field strength of @xmath71 kg for the assumed star radius of 859@xmath90 @xcite , which is @xmath91 times stronger than the average magnetic field ( @xmath7few g ) for an agb star @xcite . in the second case , if the magnetic field pressure equals the gas kinetic pressure , then @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the gas density in g@xmath94 . since @xmath95 for a free radial expansion then @xmath96(g ) @xmath97 . with @xmath84 in units of @xmath98yr@xmath5 , @xmath55 in units of 10kms@xmath5 and the distance to the star , @xmath99 in au we obtain    @xmath100    for @xmath84 = 3.4 @xcite , @xmath55 = 1.12 , @xmath99=5350au ( table [ maintable ] ) this equation yields a b field strength of 0.9 mg , which is close to our value of 0.6 mg .",
    "this means that in our measured oh maser region there is nearly equilibrium between the magnetic and kinematic pressure .",
    "1 may not be true close to the star where a solar ( @xmath101 ) or dipole ( @xmath102 ) type field may exist . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic field measurements from maser observations indicate that the field strength follows the relation @xmath103 over an enormous range of the number density , @xmath104 , @xcite .",
    "this empirical relation predicts a number density of molecular hydrogen of @xmath105@xmath94 for a 0.6 mg field . for the kinematic model",
    "@xcite such a density is sufficient to sustain the 1612-mhz maser operation when @xmath106 and @xmath107m@xmath4yr@xmath5 for relative abundances of oh molecule higher than @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "these mass - loss rate values are consistent with those recently obtained with the co observations and modelling ( @xcite and sect .",
    "we note that a magnetic field of 0.6 mg is two orders of magnitude larger than the average interstellar magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic field in the oh regions could be compressed or amplified by a factor of @xmath7100 @xcite .",
    "a model of field compression by @xcite predicts an amplification factor of up to 10 .",
    "another possibility is local enhancements of the magnetic field related to the stellar spots or convective cells which might produce the magnetic clouds similarly as in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "our observations show that the lower limit to the brightness temperature of the strongest 1612-mhz emission is up to 6@xmath110k ( sect .",
    "vlbi observations at a phase of 0.67 detected only the extreme blue - shifted emission near @xmath166.0kms@xmath5 , which was unresolved with @xmath7100mas resolution , while the extreme red - shifted emission was resolved out @xcite .",
    "@xmath76 for the unresolved emission was estimated at @xmath111k .",
    "our merlin data were obtained at phase 0.44 , so it is likely that the flux density level was similar to that observed with the vlbi . using the vlbi estimates of size and brightness temperature for the extreme blue - shifted emission and the distance and shell radius given in table [ maintable ] we estimated that the maser beaming solid angle , @xmath112 , is 0.016sr .",
    "this is close to the canonical value @xcite . from our comparison of the angular sizes of the two extreme maser regions ( sect .",
    "3.6 ) we get 0.022@xmath10.024sr for the beaming solid angle of the red - shifted emission . in the standard maser theory",
    "@xcite the 1612mhz maser stimulated emission rate can be approximated @xcite ) by @xmath113    this implies @xmath114 = 0.011s@xmath5 and 0.008@xmath10.002s@xmath5 for the blue- and red - shifted emission regions , respectively .",
    "we notice that the first value is consistent with @xmath114 predicted for interstellar oh masers @xcite .",
    "the radiative and collisional decay rate for the 1612mhz is not observationally constrained but its upper limit can be estimated @xcite with the following equation @xmath115    with the above estimated values of @xmath76 and @xmath112 for the blue - shifted emission @xmath116s@xmath5 which implies @xmath1177 , i.e. the maser in oh127 is weakly saturated .",
    "this result appears to be consistent with previous observations showing a fixed relation between the oh and infrared emissions @xcite .",
    "the lack of relatively large random variations in the oh maser fluxes of oh127 also suggests that the maser emission is saturated .",
    "full polarization monitoring of 1612- and 1667-mhz oh maser lines over a period of 6.5years and one epoch polarimetric map of oh127 led to the following new results :    \\(1 ) the oh maser fluxes show large ( 0.8@xmath11.4mag ) amplitude variations with period of @xmath71600days .",
    "the ratios of the integrated flux at 1612 and 1667mhz lines of 5.4 and 9.9 at the minimum and maximum , respectively indicate a partial suppression of the 1667mhz emission .",
    "\\(2 ) the comparison of the light - travel diameter of the 1612-mhz maser shell obtained using the nrt with the angular diameter determined from merlin maps yields a distance of 3.87@xmath00.28kpc .",
    "\\(3 ) the fluxes of polarized emission follow the variations of the total flux , whereas the degrees of circular and linear polarization are constant within measurement accuracy .",
    "\\(4 ) the tentative detection of a zeeman pair at 1612mhz implies a magnetic field strength of @xmath10.6 mg at a distance of @xmath75400au .",
    "the strong alignment of polarization position angles at both the near and far sides of the shell and the presence of a net polarization suggest a regular magnetic field .",
    "\\(5 ) the stellar luminosity of oh127 is slightly below the agb limit and the mass loss rate is typical for an agb star .",
