    "as usually derived , this amplitude contains the current  current amplitude and the weak axial nucleon current . in the next step ,",
    "one calculates the contributions to the current  current amplitude .",
    "if one restricts oneself only to the contributions due to the nucleon born terms , one really has an electroproduction amplitude containing the @xmath3 form factor .",

    "in contrast to it , the rmc in hydrogen ^- + p _ + + n , [ rmcp ] allows one to study the momentum dependence of @xmath3 in a certain interval of the values of the momentum transfer .",

    "it was found @xcite that it is the regularization of the feynman one  loop diagrams that produces the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "an elegant study of the chiral anomaly has later been performed within the path integral method in ref.@xcite .",
    "non  invariance under the chiral transformations of the measure in the path integral over the fermion fields means that the functional integral is not invariant and the chiral symmetry is broken .",

    "the consistency conditions will be the same as in qcd and it can be shown that the anomaly function will be the same , too @xcite .    at the level of effective low energy lagrangians , the term , breaking the chiral symmetry , should be present in the lagrangian from the very beginning and it is called the anomalous lagrangian .",

    "this follows from the fact that in this case , the anomaly function , arising in the vector meson sector of the anomalous lagrangian , differs from the one , derived from the qcd .",
    "then such a theory is in contradiction with the fundamental postulate @xcite that any effective low energy theory of hadrons should strictly respect symmetries imbedded in the qcd and the consequences following from it , including the mode in which these symmetries are broken . since the anomaly function is a direct consequence of the anomalously broken chiral symmetry of the qcd , the same anomaly function should be immanent also to any anomalous hadron lagrangian .    on the contrary",
    ", introducing the vector mesons within the framework of the hidden local symmetries ( hls ) provides a theory of the interaction of the mesons with the electroweak fields that is free of the above mentioned defects @xcite .",
    "methodologically , the construction of the anomalous hls lagrangian does not differ from that of the non  anomalous one .",
    "the extension of the symmetry ( [ gg ] ) by the group @xmath69_l$ ] of the local transformations needs introduction both of the related massless gauge fields and non  physical compensators . in the next step , after the spontaneously breaking of the extended symmetry , the compensator fields disappear , whereas the gauge fields acquire the mass .",
