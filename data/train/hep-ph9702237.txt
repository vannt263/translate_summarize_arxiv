    "<S> we propose a supergravity model that contains elements recently shown to arise in the strongly - coupled limit of the @xmath0 heterotic string ( m - theory ) , including a no - scale  like khler potential , the identification of the string scale with the gauge coupling unification scale , and the onset of supersymmetry breaking at an intermediate scale determined by the size of the eleventh dimension of m - theory . </S>",

    "<S> these successes include the taming of quantum gravity , the prediction of space - time supersymmetry ( at least at the planck scale ) , the prediction of realistic gauge groups and matter representations , and the illumination of the family and fermion mass problems . despite these accomplishments , </S>",
    "<S> string theory has not been able to deliver on its original promise of an unambiguous description of high - energy physics in terms of a single parameter : the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is traced to the very large degeneracy of the string vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , different string theories ( _ e.g. _ , heterotic , type i , type ii ) are also allowed . </S>",
    "<S> these and other difficulties , like the supersymmetry breaking mechanism , were thought to require an understanding of the strongly - coupled limit of string . </S>",
    "<S> of course , if strings are strongly coupled much doubt is cast on the results obtained at weak coupling that are not protected by non - renormalization theorems . </S>",
    "<S> one such result is the desirable prediction of a no - scale supergravity structure @xcite with zero vacuum energy at tree level , at least in some string compactifications @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent discovery of extended duality symmetries relating different string theories at various values of the string coupling @xcite has provided a much needed tool to study the strongly - coupled limit of strings . </S>",
    "<S> these new developments have ellucidated some of the problematic features of weakly - coupled strings @xcite , such as the relation between different string theories , a new mechanism to reconcile the gauge coupling and string unification scales , and a possible topological mechanism for supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the new symmetries require an enlarged set of possible theories , including five - branes and 11-dimensional supergravity .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we concentrate on the low - energy supersymmetry phenomenology that might arise in the strongly - coupled limit of the @xmath5 heterotic string in ten dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this theory has been shown @xcite to map into a weakly - coupled eleven - dimensional  m - theory \" , which has as its low - energy limit eleven - dimensional supergravity . </S>",
    "<S> the eleventh dimension ( @xmath6 ) has an orbifold structure ( @xmath7 ) : at one end live the observable fields contained in @xmath8 , at the other end live the hidden sector fields contained in @xmath9 , and in the middle ( ` bulk ' ) propagate the gravitational fields . </S>",
    "<S> one can distinguish a few mass scales in such scenario : the eleven - dimensional planck scale ( @xmath10 ) , the size of the eleventh dimension ( @xmath6 ) , and the compactification mass scale ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> strong - weak coupling duality relates these three scales as follows @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unified gauge coupling ( @xmath14 as deduced from running the standard model gauge couplings ) , @xmath15 is the usual planck mass , and @xmath16 is the volume of the compactified space ( which does not include the eleventh dimension ) . </S>",
    "<S> this volume depends on the compactification manifold used , and in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : vdef ] ) it has been parametrized in terms of two internal radii : @xmath17 representing @xmath18 possibly ` large ' dimensions and @xmath19 representing @xmath20 possible ` small ' dimensions . in compactification on symmetric calabi - yau manifolds @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of these equations to gauge coupling unification was pointed out by witten @xcite , who noticed that @xmath10 , essentially the  string \" unification scale ( @xmath22 ) , might be lowered down to the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath23 by choosing a sufficiently large compactification volume @xmath16 . previously the only way to reduce @xmath22 ( at tree level ) </S>",
    "<S> was to increase the unified gauge coupling , which then disagreed with the result obtained by running the gauge couplings up from low energies . with @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> are reviewed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ]    a very interesting result that also emerges from ` m - phenomenology ' is the appearance of the no - scale supergravity structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no - scale supergravity is then seen to emerge both in the weakly- and in the strongly - coupled limits of the heterotic string . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the khler potential seems to be of the form that guarantees universality of the scalar masses ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath24 ) at the scale where supersymmetry - breaking effects are first felt in the observable sector ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a more model - dependent question ( as it involves the superpotential ) is the form of the parameter @xmath26 , which for simplicity we will take to vanish ( @xmath27 ) , as is typical in weakly - coupled string realizations of no - scale supergravity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even more model dependent are the values of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath28 and its associated supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> . these will be left unspecified in our present analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the gaugino masses will be taken to be universal ( @xmath30 ) and will parametrize the low - energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these may be obtained in principle from knowledge of the gauge kinetic function and the gravitino mass . after using the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking conditions at the electroweak scale , </S>",
    "<S> we need to specify only two parameters to fully describe the low - energy supersymmetry spectrum : @xmath30 and the ratio of higgs vacuum expectaction values @xmath31 .    also of great interest </S>",
    "<S> is the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking that appears to be emerging in m - phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> horava @xcite has argued that supersymmetry breaking , say via gaugino condensation in the hidden sector , is not felt immediately in the observable sector because of a topological obstruction ( essentially the eleventh dimension of length @xmath6 that separates the two sectors ) . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry breaking becomes apparent only after the renormalization scale is low enough to not reveal the presence of the eleventh dimension anymore ( _ i.e. _ , when this extra dimension becomes ` compact ' ) . in practice one </S>",
    "<S> is to allow for non - vanishing supersymmetry breaking parameters only for scales @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can leave a deep imprint on the low - energy sparticle spectrum , which depends quantitatively on the amount of ` running ' of these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> as has been noted in connection with the relevance of gaugino condensation @xcite ( and as we emphasize below ) , @xmath33 is expected to have a typical intermediate - scale value . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of taking @xmath34 is most noticeable in the case of @xmath24 which we consider here . on purely phenomenological grounds , the effect of considering @xmath25 as a new parameter in unified models was ( to our knowledge ) first discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    before dwelling into the low - energy phenomenology , </S>",
    "<S> let us elucidate the value of @xmath34 that we wish to consider . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we set @xmath35 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m11def ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to solve for @xmath36 . substituting this value in the expression for @xmath33 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rhodef ] ) we obtain @xmath37 which is very suggestive in the context of gaugino condensation where @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> it also follows that @xmath39 note that in the reasonable case of @xmath40 , the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath11 is greatly reduced and @xmath41 is also obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to the analysis of the low - energy sparticle spectrum under the assumptions of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> as remarked above , the only free parameters are @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking plus two basic phenomenological requirements , allow solutions in the @xmath44 plane for only one sign of @xmath28 and only within a completely bounded region . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of @xmath45 , this region is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : boundary13 ] , where to facilitate comparison with experiment we also show the region in the @xmath46 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit on @xmath30 ( for a fixed value of @xmath31 ) follows from the requirement that the lightest supersymmetric particle be neutral @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> above the upper boundary the right - handed selectron ( @xmath47 ) becomes lighter than the lightest neutralino ( @xmath48 ) . ) </S>",
    "<S> is in effect slightly lighter than the right - handed selectron . ] </S>",
    "<S> the bottom boundary is obtained by imposing the absolute lower limit on the sneutrino mass from lep  1 searches ( @xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the area to the right of the right - most tip of the region is excluded by these two conflicting constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31 dependence of these constraints may be understood from the d - term contribution to the @xmath47 and @xmath50 mass formulas @xmath51 where the @xmath52 are some rge - dependent constants and @xmath53 whereas @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line indicates the lower bound on @xmath31 that is consistent with the top - quark mass ( @xmath55 ) and perturbative yukawa couplings up to the unification scale @xcite . in practice , the lep  172 lower bound on the chargino mass ( @xmath56 @xcite ) , which is always satisfied in this model . ] </S>",
    "<S> gives the strongest constraint on the parameter space ( dashed line on bottom panel in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : boundary13 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , a portion of the parameter space remains allowed , and in fact it is within the reach of future lep  2 energy upgrades , as we discuss below .    to give a more detailed picture of the low - energy spectrum , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectrum ] we display representative sparticle masses as a function of the chargino mass for @xmath45 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of @xmath31 allows the widest range of sparticle masses ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : boundary13 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows that the spectrum ` terminates ' when @xmath58 approaches @xmath59 from below , as mentioned above in connection with the upper boundary in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : boundary13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note the significant splitting of the top - squark ( @xmath60 ) masses around the average squark ( @xmath61 ) mass .    in the lep 172 allowed region in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : boundary13 ] and [ fig : spectrum ] we find @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> both of these particles appear within the reach of lep  2 . </S>",
    "<S> more to the point , one might wonder whether the such light right - handed selectron masses might have already been excluded by lep  2 searches , as they have been certainly kinematically accessible . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the cross section @xmath64 at lep  161 , for which explicit limits have been released by the opal collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath65 , which in @xmath66 would have yielded a maximum of two events . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the experimental sensitivity to this mode is at the 0.5  pb level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , past lep  2 searches in the selectron channels do not restrict the allowed parameter space any further </S>",
    "<S> . approaches @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> ] one should also consider the predictions for trilepton events at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath67 for @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the leptonic decays of the chargino and neutralino are maximally enhanced because of the lighter right - handed sleptons and sneutrinos , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 . combining these numbers we arrive at a single channel ( _ i.e. _ , any single one of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , or @xmath75 ) cross section of @xmath76  pb . </S>",
    "<S> this result is slightly below the sensitivity reached at the tevatron in trilepton searches @xcite , and thus these also do not constrain the allowed parameter space any further .    </S>",
    "<S> one may also want to study the effect of different choices for @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these affect the shape of the bounded region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : boundary13 ] , although not very significantly in the interval specified by eq .  ( </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rho ] ) . as a means of quantifying this behavior </S>",
    "<S> , one can determine the maximum allowed ( _ i.e. _ , passing lep  1 cuts ) chargino masses for a range of @xmath25 values . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chmax ] . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows that lep  2 data presently do not constrain @xmath25 in any way , although future higher energy runs will soon begin to constrain @xmath25 . </S>"
