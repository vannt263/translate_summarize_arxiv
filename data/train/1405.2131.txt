    "solar flares are sudden brightening observed over the sun s surface or above the solar limb .",
    "the energy release in a flare varies from @xmath1 ergs in a sub - flare to @xmath2 ergs in a typical large event @xcite",
    ". it could be up to @xmath3 ergs in the largest events such as the one on 4 november 2003 @xcite .",
    "the source of its energy is generally believed coming from the magnetic energy , @xmath4 , stored primarily in active regions ( ars ) .",
    "this energy has a minimum when the coronal electric current vanishes ( potential field configuration ) , and increases in value when the field becomes twisted or open @xcite .",
    "the development of flaring conditions does not depend on the total magnetic flux , but depends on the availability of free magnetic energy ( fme ) and the triggering processes to release it @xcite .",
    "the fme in magnetic field is the amount of magnetic energy in excess of the minimum energy attributed to the potential field @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it can be roughly estimated from vector magnetograph data on the photosphere with the virial expression @xcite @xmath6}dxdy,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is assumed to be force - free and vanishes when @xmath8 .",
    "the formula can also be extended with the virial theorem to the case in which the field is not force - free but in a static equilibrium with plasma pressure and gravity @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the total energy of the system contains not only the magnetic energy , but also thermal and gravitational energy . in general , when using eq .",
    "( 1 ) to estimate fme , it is hard to estimate errors that would be introduced in the calculations , as the fields are neglected in the lateral and upper boundaries .    at present , exact measurements of the three dimensional ( 3-d ) fields are not yet available and vector magnetic fields are only measured in the photospheric level .",
    "methods using magnetically sensitive coronal spectral lines @xcite or coronal seismology @xcite have been developed .",
    "these methods , however , do not provide a quantitative 3-d structure of the coronal fields . with the observed photospheric vector magnetic fields ,",
    "there are several ways to obtain the 3-d magnetic field in the corona .",
    "one of them is the data - driven magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) modeling @xcite .",
    "this approach , although more computationally intensive and less routinely used , gives impressive results in recent studies @xcite .",
    "another useful approach is the well - known nonlinear force - free ( nlff ) field extrapolation , using the vector photospheric magnetograms as the boundary condition @xcite . with a nlff field",
    ", fme may be evaluated by the expression @xmath9 which has been used in many recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , there is another expression to evaluate fme @xmath10 where @xmath11 is called the source field to describe the nonpotentiality of the magnetic field @xcite . in general ,",
    "( 2 ) gives the energy difference between the nlff field @xmath12 and the respective potential field @xmath13 , while eq .",
    "( 3 ) gives the total energy of the non - potential field @xmath11 .",
    "their difference , over the entire volume @xmath14 , amounts to zero , given the well - known decomposition of the non - potential field @xmath15 into poloidal @xmath13 and toroidal @xmath11 components . using the above two equations",
    ", we may define a mean value to estimate fme , namely    @xmath16    with uncertainty @xmath17 which is derived from eq.(2)-eq.(3 ) .",
    "the magnetic field measurements and errors in extrapolation contribute to this uncertainty .",
    "in addition , @xmath18 determined with eq.(4 ) is regarded as the upper limit of the energy that is available to power flares / cmes because not all of the fme mentioned above is free .",
    "constrained by the conservation of total magnetic helicity , the lowest energy state of ars is actually linear force free ( lff ) field instead of potential field @xcite . in this case",
    ", the fme should be estimated by @xmath19 , the difference between the total energy and the energy of a lff field . however , lff fields are unrealistic for the open upper halfspace , because the energy is unbounded ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , one often finds @xmath18 from the difference @xmath20 being negative .    in the past three decades , as the diagnosis of magnetic fields in the chromosphere and corona is difficult , various surface nonpotentiality indices of the solar ars have been developed to predict flares ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as magnetic shear angle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , electric current ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , current helicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , subsurface kinetic helicity @xcite , horizontal magnetic gradient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , length of the high - gradient and high - sheared polarity inversion line @xcite , effective distance between two opposite magnetic polarities in one ar @xcite and photospheric excess energy @xcite . compared with those photospheric nonpotentiality indices ,",
    "fme derived from 3-d coronal magnetic configuration over ars seems to be a more direct physical parameter related to the available energy to power flares .",
    "based on 75 ar s magnetograms , @xcite conducted a pilot study of the statistical correlation between fme derived from 3-d nlff fields and flare index ( fi ) @xcite .",
    "they found a positive correlation between the fme and flare productivity of solar ars . in this study , we revisit this issue by using a much more extended sample of ar vector magnetograms obtained with sdo / hmi .",
    "we study both fme and total unsigned magnetic flux ( @xmath21 ) of ars in order to compare their respective abilities to predict flare productivity .",
    "in addition , we explore the statistical correlation between fi and other magnetic parameters : the total unsigned electric current @xmath22 @xcite , the averaged twisted measure @xmath23}/\\sum{\\vert{b_z(x , y)}\\vert}$ ] @xcite , and the proxy of photospheric excess energy @xmath24 .",
    "table 1 lists all the parameters investigated in this paper .",
    "the data sample includes 6261 photospheric vector magnetograms covering 61 ars .",
    "the center locations of these magnetograms are within 45-degree from the disk center , and their disk passage is in the period of may 2010 through april 2013 as listed in table 2 . the magntograms are obtained with the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) on board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) .",
    "we use the sharp ( spaceweather hmi active region patches ) data series @xcite which are re - mapped in cartesian coordinates using cylindrical equal area ( cea ) projection .",
    "the 180-degree ambiguity in the transverse field has been resolved with metcalf s minimum energy method @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the original magnetogram data is about 0.@xmath255 pixel@xmath26 . to speed up extrapolation , we lower the resolution and rebin them to 3@xmath25 pixel@xmath26 . we preprocess the photospheric magnetograms using a method devised by wiegelmann , inhester & sakurai ( 2006 ) .",
    "nlff fields and potential fields are then extrapolated from the preprocessed photospheric boundary with the weighted optimization @xcite and fft @xcite methods , respectively .    note that we do not include smoothing in the data preprocessing . to investigate how the results vary due to the smoothing",
    ", we carry out some testing extrapolations .",
    "two sets of vector magnetograms are used as the bottom boundary of the nlff field extrapolation : the magnetograms smoothed over a @xmath27 area , and the same magnetograms without smoothing .",
    "the magnetograms used here were taken in ar 11158 spanning from 00:00 ut of 2011 february 12 to 15:48 ut of february 15 with a cadence of 12 min .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows @xmath28 ( with smoothing ) versus @xmath29 ( without smoothing ) . the blue line is a linear fitting to the data .",
    "the smoothed results seem to diverge for @xmath30 ergs , but below this limit they give very similar fme values to those obtained without smoothing .",
    "even so , the rank correlation coefficient ( rcc ) , which assesses how well the relationship between two variables and can be described using a monotonic function , is very high up to @xmath31 .",
    "we give the correlation s confidence level defined as @xmath32 shown in parentheses in the bottom right corner of panels ( a ) and ( c ) , where @xmath33 is the probability ( binomial distribution ) that the observed correlation would occur by random chance .",
    "it is calculated by the routine @xmath34 described in section 14.6 of numerical recipes @xcite .",
    "we also evaluate the variation of fmes from the magnetograms in different spatial resolution .",
    "the data of ar 11158 at 19:48:00 ut on 2011 february 13 is used .",
    "the obtained values are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ergs , corresponding to the spatial resolutions of , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . therefore , fme does not change significantly with different resolutions , so it would not affect our conclusion .",
    "now we consider the magnetic flux imbalance in our data sample .",
    "it may be evaluated by the ratio of the net flux to the total unsigned one in the field of view , @xmath41 .",
    "a histogram of @xmath42 for all the data is shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "it is found that except for some data with a very large @xmath42 ( e.g. 0.6 ) , most of the data ( @xmath43 ) shows a value of @xmath42 less than 0.2 .",
    "after these procedures , we obtain all the extrapolated 3-d fields based on 6261 vector magnetograms . @xmath44 and @xmath45 from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are then determined subsequently .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows a scatter plot of @xmath44 versus @xmath45 for all the data .",
    "their correlation is very high , up to @xmath46 .",
    "a linear fit ( blue line ) shows that @xmath45 is greater than @xmath44 with a factor @xmath47 .",
    "their difference ( see eq . ( 5 ) ) can be used to evaluate the uncertainty of @xmath48 . for our case , however , the relative error may be more helpful .",
    "therefore , we define a relative one of @xmath48 , namely @xmath49 , whose histogram is shown in figure 1(d ) .",
    "we find that @xmath50 of fmes is with @xmath51 .",
    "to further ensure the reliability of the analysis , we exclude both samples , those with the flux imbalance @xmath52 and those with the relative fme uncertainty @xmath53 .",
    "finally , the remained sample of 3226 vector magnetograms are used for further analysis .",
    "solar flares are conventionally classified as x , m , c , or b according to their peak soft x - ray ( sxr ) flux in the wavelength range 1 to 8 angstroms , as measured by the geostationary operational environmental satellite ( goes ) and recorded in the noaa space environment center s solar event reports .",
    "the peak flux of x- , m- , c- and b - class flares is of 10@xmath54 , 10@xmath55 , 10@xmath56 and 10@xmath57 w m@xmath58 magnitude order , respectively .",
    "if given the beginning and ending time of a time window , then the dimensionless fi in this interval @xmath59 ( usually measured in days ) is defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are the sxr peak flux of x- , m- , c- , and b - class flares , respectively , produced by one ar within @xmath59-days . this definition measures a time - accumulated flare production , which is somehow different from the time - averaged flare production used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when we study the correlation between fme and flare production in a fixed time period , there is no difference between the time - accumulated fi used here and the time - averaged fi used in previous studies .",
    "however , they are different when we study the frequency distributions and the power - law indices of flare production ( subsection 3.2 ) . thereafter , the abbreviation of fi in this paper refers to the time - accumulated flare index .",
    "moreover , to characterize the ars with certain flare magnitudes , we set a series of thresholds of fi to study their correlations with the magnetic parameters of ars .",
    "for example , if we investigate the @xmath65c1.0 , @xmath65m1.0 and @xmath65m5.0 flare productions , then will set @xmath661 , 10 and 50 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , @xmath67 denotes all the ars data satisfying this condition , no matter whether the ars are flare productive or not .",
    "statistical analyses show that most of the frequency distributions of parameters related to solar activities can be characterized by power - law distributions @xcite , which reflects an underlying power law in the distribution of energy release @xcite .",
    "we also find such a distribution in the histograms of fme , fi and magnetic flux shown in figure 2 .",
    "the histograms use all the data identified by @xmath67 .",
    "we apply chi - square ( @xmath68 ) test to evaluate whether they obey power - law distribution @xmath69 or not , where @xmath70 refers to @xmath48 , @xmath71 and @xmath21 , and @xmath72 is the power - law index .",
    "the fme and fi data are divided into 10 bins , and those of magnetic flux , 15 bins .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows that one of the bins in the histogram ( @xmath73 ) of @xmath74 has the sample size @xmath75 , so the @xmath68-test can not be applied to this histogram .",
    "the test to the other histograms shows that the values of @xmath72 are @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the fme and magnetic flux distribution , respectively , and @xmath78 for fi in the time window of 2- or 3-days , which are comparable to the index of total energy release in soft x - ray ( 1.5 - 1.6 ) , and that of the peak flux ( 1.7 ) @xcite .",
    "table 3 lists the values of @xmath72 when the thresholds of fi are set as @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the time windows @xmath81 days .",
    "the power - law index @xmath82 of @xmath71 does not change much with the increasing thresholds , whereas that of @xmath48 decreases systematically from @xmath76 to 1.5 .",
    "the index of magntic flux also shows a decrease , but with a large fluctuation . generally , in most cases",
    "the difference between the power - law indices , of fi , fme , and the flux is insignificant , that is within measurement / fitting errors .",
    "we set 5 thresholds for fi , namely @xmath83 and 100 .",
    "the histograms of @xmath48 and @xmath21 under these thresholds are shown in the first row of figures 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "we here introduce the definition of flare productivity @xmath84 @xcite , where @xmath85 is of one measure describing magnetic properties , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the number of events ( their flaring activity independent of strength ) and the total samples , respectively .",
    "it denotes flaring productivity of the ars under certain properties of nonpotentiality and magnetic flux . with this definition , @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    "are obtained at different thresholds of @xmath71 , as illustrated in the second row of figure 3 and 4 , respectively . in these panels ,",
    "the black solid lines are the boltzmann sigmoidal fittings @xcite to the curves of flare productivity . in the top panels of figure 3 ,",
    "we notice that the data show discontinuity in the energy range of @xmath90 ergs with a bump appearing at the position of @xmath91 ergs .",
    "we thus plot a dotted - line crossing the blue - line bump ( @xmath65m1.0 flares ) in the first panel of figure 3 , which roughly corresponds to the sample number of 50 . therefore , in order to guarantee statistical significance , we do not fit the flare productivity when @xmath92 is less than 50 .",
    "we attempt to further illustrate the flare productivity predicted by @xmath48 and @xmath21 with a specific case .",
    "for instance , when the fme is taken at @xmath93 ergs , roughly corresponding to the magnetic flux at @xmath94 mx ( see figure 7(a ) ) , the corresponding flare productivity within the time windows of @xmath81 days can be obtained as listed in table 4 .",
    "generally , @xmath95 declines rapidly with increasing threshold and rises steadily with the increase of the time window .",
    "moreover , @xmath95 is higher as predicted by @xmath48 in each time window at a given threshold , suggesting that this parameter can give a slightly better prediction for fi than @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , we can not give the productivity when @xmath96 ergs , as the sample size is inadequate ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "it indicates that more ar samples that produce large flares ( @xmath98m5.0 ) are needed to supplement this study to make a more accurate flare forecasting for larger events .",
    "figure 5 shows the scatter plots of @xmath48 versus @xmath71 ( top ) and @xmath21 versus @xmath71 ( bottom ) for all the data ( @xmath67 ) , respectively . in spite of the fact that the data are widely scattered",
    ", the results still reveal a weak positive correlation between the quantities . for instance , in @xmath99-days the rcc between @xmath48 and @xmath71 is 57@xmath100 and the rcc between @xmath21 and @xmath71 @xmath101 .",
    "generally , the correlations of @xmath71 with @xmath48 and @xmath21 are nearly equivalent in the selected time windows , which are comparable to , but less than , the @xmath102 correlation between eruptive - flare production and ar sigmoidality as well as size @xcite .",
    "furthermore , figure 6 shows that the rcc varies with the thresholds of fi ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) , fme ( panel ( c ) ) and magnetic flux ( panel ( d ) ) . for convenience , we define here the threshold of fi as tfi . the relationship between them",
    ", e.g. @xmath103 is equivalent to @xmath104 .",
    "likewise , the threshold of fme is defined as tfme and that of magnetic flux as tmf . in the figure ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath105 is set to be 50 ( at this threshold @xmath106 ) , that of @xmath107 is @xmath108 ergs ( @xmath109 ) , and that of @xmath110 is @xmath111 mx ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) respectively show the rcc between fme and fi and rcc between magnetic flux and fi as a function of @xmath105 . both rccs change with a very similar trend : declining first when @xmath113 , then rising at larger threshold ( @xmath114 ) , an finally keeping nearly unchanged when @xmath115 .",
    "note that the variation of the rccs in the range of @xmath116 is opposite to that of @xmath117 , increasing with the decreasing time window .",
    "a similar feature can be found in figure 6(d ) for the correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath71 , and the turnover point occurs at @xmath118 mx . in figure 6(c ) for the correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath71 , the rccs exhibit a large fluctuation with @xmath107 .",
    "those in the 2- and 3-day time windows change similarly in magnitude , but are all greater than that in the 1-day time window .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the rccs decrease first when the threshold is less than @xmath119 ergs , while then increase when it is greater than @xmath120 ergs .",
    "however , in figure 6(d ) the rccs only show a monotonically decreasing trend in the entire range of @xmath110 .",
    "this reflects that ars with the larger fme , rather magnetic flux , are more favorable to produce flares @xcite .",
    "figure 7 shows the scatter plots of @xmath21 versus @xmath48 ( panel(a ) ) , @xmath121 ( panel ( b ) ) , @xmath122 ( panel ( c ) ) and @xmath123 ( panel ( d ) ) for all the data ( @xmath67 ) , respectively . except @xmath123 ,",
    "the correlations of @xmath21 with the others are very high , more than @xmath124 .",
    "we note that there are likely two slopes in the @xmath125 plot with the turning point occurs at @xmath126 mx .",
    "similarly , we can find this feature in figure 5(a ) of @xcite .",
    "finally , we list the rccs of @xmath127 with all the used measures in table 5 .",
    "generally , the rccs associated with @xmath71 are relatively weak ( @xmath128 ) , and those with @xmath21 are very strong ( @xmath129 ) except the measure of twist .",
    "this confirms reports that there is no discernible correlation between the magnetic twist measure and magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "in this paper , based on a data sample of 3226 vector magnetograms in 61 active regions , we present the frequency distributions of free magnetic energy ( fme ) ( i.e. , @xmath48 defined in eq . ( 4 ) ) , flare index ( fi ) , and total unsigned magnetic flux ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we also analyze the potential of @xmath48 and @xmath21 as flare predictors and examine the magnitude scaling correlation between fi and several magnetic measures such as @xmath48 , @xmath21 , total unsigned electric current @xmath121 , proxy of photospheric free magnetic energy @xmath122 and averaged magnetic twist measure @xmath123 .",
    "it is found that the frequency functions of fme , fi and magnetic flux all exhibit a power - law distribution .",
    "the index of @xmath48 ( see table 3 ) , which is steeper than that of @xmath71 ( @xmath21 ) , varies from the maximum 2.0 to @xmath78 with the threshold of @xmath71 .",
    "the difference between the power - law indices , of fi , fme , and the flux is insignificant .",
    "we also find that @xmath48 shows an improved flare predictability ( demonstrated in table 4 ) in comparison with @xmath21 .",
    "however , in terms of the magnitude scaling correlation between @xmath130 and @xmath48 , @xmath21 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( see table 5 ) based on all the used samples , the magnetic measure of fme shows no improvement for flare predictability .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous study of @xcite .",
    "we then set a series of thresholds for @xmath71 , @xmath48 and @xmath21 to study how the above correlations vary with these thresholds .",
    "it is found that the correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath71 shows a general decreasing trend with an increasing threshold of flux , while that between @xmath48 and @xmath71 increases when the threshold of fme is greater than @xmath131 ergs .",
    "this suggests that ars with the larger fme rather magnetic flux are more favorable to produce flares @xcite .    generally speaking",
    ", despite the fact that @xmath48 is one of the most direct measures of the available energy in a 3-d magnetic field , our large - sample study shows that its correlation with @xmath130 is still weak ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite gave a detailed discussion about the cause of the lack of satisfactory results , such as the quality of the extrapolated nlff fields which is influenced by a number of inadequacies of the boundary data , uncertainties in the data reduction , etc .",
    "in the present study , we first evaluate the flux imbalance in our chosen sample as shown in figure 2(b ) and find that most of the data ( @xmath43 ) are of with @xmath132 .",
    "we then evaluate the uncertainty in the determined fme and find @xmath50 of the sample with @xmath133 as shown in figure 1(d ) . to ensure the reliability of the analysis ,",
    "these two types of data are excluded from the original sample .",
    "we also evaluated the energy in excess of the lff component @xmath134 with the averaged twisted measure @xmath123 @xcite , and found @xmath18 of nearly half of all the data is negative .",
    "these negative values hamper us to give a further analysis .",
    "one way to get around this problem is to find the relative magnetic helicity from the extrapolated nlff field and infer the constant @xmath72-value corresponding to this helicity , then further calculate a lff field and its corresponding @xmath135 .",
