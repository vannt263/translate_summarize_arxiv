    "these are labeled planar graphs with overcrossings and undercrossings marked , representing a projection of the knot onto a plane .",
    "they showed that any ambient isotopy of a polygonal knot can be achieved by a finite sequence of piecewise linear moves which slide the knot across a single triangle , which are called _ elementary moves _ ( or @xmath14-moves ) .",
    "they also showed that two knots were ambient isotopic if and only if their knot diagrams were equivalent under a finite sequence of local combinatorial changes , now called _ reidemeister moves _ , see  7 .",
    "a triangle in @xmath6 defines a _ trivial knot _ , and a loop in the plane with no crossings",
    "is said to be a _ trivial knot diagram_. a knot diagram @xmath1 is _ unknotted _ if it is equivalent to a trivial knot diagram under reidemeister moves .",
    "we measure the complexity of a knot diagram @xmath1 by using its _ crossing number _ , the number of vertices in the planar graph @xmath1 , see  7 .",
    "a problem of long standing is to determine an upper bound for the number of reidemeister moves needed to transform an unknotted knot diagram @xmath1 to the trivial knot diagram , as an explicit function of the crossing number @xmath3 , see welsh @xcite .",
    "this paper obtains such a bound .",
    "[ thm101 ] there is a positive constant @xmath0 , such that for each @xmath15 , any unknotted knot diagram @xmath1 with @xmath3 crossings can be transformed to the trivial knot diagram using at most @xmath2 reidemeister moves .",
    "we obtain the explicit value of @xmath16 for @xmath0 ; this value can clearly be improved . in this paper",
    "we have not attempted to get an optimal value for @xmath0 , and several of our estimates are accordingly rather rough .    in 1934",
    "goeritz @xcite showed that there exist diagrams @xmath1 of the unknot such that any sequence of reidemeister moves converting @xmath1 to the trivial knot must pass through some intermediate knot diagram @xmath17 that has more crossings than @xmath1 .",

    "this holds because each reidemeister move creates or destroys at most two crossings , and all crossings must be eliminated by the final reidemeister move .",
    "it seems possible that for each knot diagram representing the unknot there exists some sequence of reidemeister moves taking it to the trivial knot diagram which keeps the crossing number of all intermediate knot diagrams bounded by a polynomial in @xmath3 .    in a general triangulated 3-manifold ,",
    "a trivial knot is a triangle lying inside one tetrahedron and an elementary move takes place entirely within a single tetrahedron of the triangulation .",

    "we obtain the explicit value @xmath20 . the hypothesis that @xmath4 lies in the interior of @xmath6",
    "can be weakened to requiring only that @xmath4 lies in @xmath6 , as we indicate in  6 .",
    "the methods we use are based on the normal surface theory of kneser @xcite and haken @xcite .",
    "haken applied this theory to obtain an algorithm to decide if a knot is trivial .",

    "first we consider an isotopy of a curve to a point across a compressing disk in a 3-manifold , secondly we consider an isotopy through a solid torus from a core to a longitude , and finally we consider an isotopy across a surface between two isotopic curves . in  6 we tie these results together to complete the proof of theorem  [ thm102 ] .",
    "we then consider the more special case of knots in @xmath12 . in  7 we outline the proof of theorem  [ thm101 ] and begin it by relating elementary moves to reidemeister moves . in  8",
