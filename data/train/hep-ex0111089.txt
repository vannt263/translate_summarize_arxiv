    "experimental observations and robust theoretical arguments have established that our universe is essentially non - visible , the luminous matter scarcely accounting for one per cent of the critical density of a flat universe ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the current picture describes an universe consisting of unknown species of dark energy ( @xmath1 ) and dark matter ( @xmath2 ) of which less than @xmath3 is of baryonic origin .",
    "most of the dark matter would then be made of non - baryonic particles filling the galactic halos , at least partially , according to a variety of models .",
    "weak interacting massive ( and neutral ) particles ( wimps ) are favourite candidates to such non - baryonic components . the lightest stable particles of supersymmetric theories , like the neutralino , describe a particular class of wimps . without entering into considerations about how about how large the baryonic dark component of the galactic halo could be ,",
    "we take for granted that there is enough room for wimps in our halo , to try to detect them , either directly or through their by - products .",
    "discovering this form of dark matter is one of the big challenges in cosmology , astrophysics and particle physics .",
    "wimps can be looked for either directly or indirectly .",
    "the indirect detection of wimps proceeds currently through two main experimental lines : either by looking in cosmic rays experiments for positrons , antiprotons , or other antinuclei produced by the wimps annihilation in the halo ( caprice , bess , ams , glast , veritas , magic ... ) , or by searching in large underground detectors ( superkamiokande , sno , soudan , macro ) or underwater neutrino telescopes ( baikal , amanda , antares , nestor ) for upward - going muons produced by the energetic neutrinos emerging as final products of the wimps annihilation in celestial bodies ( sun , earth ... ) .",
    "this talk will deal with the direct detection of wimps .",
    "the direct detection of wimps relies in the measurement of the wimp elastic scattering off the target nuclei of a suitable detector . pervading the galactic halos , slow moving ( @xmath4",
    "km / s ) , and heavy ( @xmath5 gev ) wimps could make a nucleus recoil with a small energy of a few kev ( @xmath6 kev ) , at a rate which depends of the type of wimp and interaction .",
    "only a fraction of the recoil , qt , is visible in the detector , depending on the type of detector and target and on the mechanism of energy deposition .",
    "the so - called quenching factor , q , is essentially unit in thermal detectors whereas for the nuclei used in conventional detectors it ranges from about 0.1 to 0.6 .",
    "for instance for a ge nucleus only about 1/4 of the recoil energy goes to ionization . on the other hand ,",
    "the smallness of the neutralino - matter interaction cross - section makes the rates of the nuclear recoil looked for very small .",
    "the variety of models and parameters used to describe the astrophysics , particle physics and nuclear physics aspects of the process make the neutralino - nucleus interaction rate encompass several orders of magnitude , going from 10 to @xmath7 c / kg day , according to the susy model and parameters@xcite .",
    "in fact , it is not higher than @xmath8 c / kg day , for the neutralino parameters which provide the most favourable relic density ( @xmath9 ) . due to such small rate and small energy deposition produced by the wimp elastic scattering ,",
    "the direct search for particle dark matter through their scattering by nuclear targets requires ultralow background detectors of a very low energy threshold .",
    "moreover , the ( almost ) exponentially decreasing shape of the predicted nuclear recoil spectrum mimics that of the low energy background registered by the detector . all these features together make the wimp detection a formidable experimental challenge .",
    "customarily , one compares the predicted event rate with the observed spectrum .",
    "if the former turns out to be larger than the measured one , the particle which would produce such event rate can be ruled out as a dark matter candidate .",
    "that is expressed as a contour line @xmath10(m ) in the plane of the wimp - nucleon elastic scattering cross section versus the wimp mass .",
    "that excludes , for each mass m , those particles with a cross - section above the contour line @xmath10(m ) .",
    "the level of background sets , consequently , the sensitivity of the experiment in eliminating candidates or in constraining their masses and cross sections .",
    "however , this mere comparison of the expected signal with the experimentally observed spectrum will not be able to detect the wimp , because such spectrum , even extremely small , could still be due to pure background sources .",
    "in other words , it would be difficult to be convinced that such signal is due to wimps and not to mere background sources . a convincing proof of the detection of wimps would need to find unique signatures in the data characteristic of them and not of the background .",
    "there exist some temporal or spatial asymmetries specific of the wimp interaction , which can not be faked by the background or by instrumental artifacts .",
    "they are due to the kinematics of the motion of the earth ( and of our detectors ) in the galactic halo .",
    "the only distinctive signature investigated up to now is a predicted annual modulation of the wimp signal rate due to the seasonal variation produced by the earth s motion with respect to the sun .",
    "such a seasonal affect has been found by the dama experiment at the @xmath11 level and has been associated to the existence of a wimp .",
    "the detectors used so far are : ionization detectors of ge ( igex , cosme , h / m , hdms ) and of si ( ucsb ) , scintillation crystals of nai ( zaragoza , dama , ukdmc , saclay , elegants ) , liquid or liquid - gas xenon detectors ( dama , ucla , ukdmc ) , calcium fluoride scintillators ( milan , osaka , roma ) , thermal detectors ( bolometers ) with saphire absorbers ( cresst , rosebud ) , with telurite absorbers , ( mibeta , cuoricino ) or with germanium absorbers ( rosebud ) as well as bolometers which also measure the ionization , like that of si ( cdms ) and of ge ( cdms , edelweiss ) .",
    "new detectors and techniques are entering the stage .",
    "worth to be mentioned are : scintillating bolometers of calcium tungstate which measure heat and high ( cresst and rosebud ) , and of bgo ( rosebud ) ; a tpc sensitive to the direction of the nuclear recoil ( drift ) ; devices which use superheated droplets ( simple and picasso ) , or those which use colloids of superconducting superheated grains ( orpheus ) . there exist also projects featuring a large amount of target nuclei in segmented detectors , both with ionization ge detectors ( genius , gedeon ) and cryogenic thermal devices ( cuore ) .",
    "table 4 gives an overview of the experiments on direct detection of wimps currently in operation or in preparation .",
    "a review of neutralino dark matter can be found in ref @xcite . wimp direct detection",
    "are reviewed , for instance in ref @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent results are given in ref @xcite .",
    "the smallness and rarity of wimp signals dictate the experimental strategies for their detection : reduce first the background , by controlling the radiopurity of the detector , its components , the shielding and the environment .",
    "the best radiopurity has been obtained in conventional ge experiments ( igex , h / m ) . in the case of the nai scintillators ( dama , ukdm , anais ) ,",
    "the achieved backgrounds are still one order of magnitude worse than those reached in ge , but the use of new radiopure powder in the crystals has lead to substantial improvements ( dama ) . the next step is to use discrimination mechanisms able to distinguish electron recoils ( tracers of the background ) from nuclear recoils ( originated by wimps or neutrons ) .",
    "two types of techniques have been applied for such purpose : a statistical pulse shape analysis ( psd ) based on the different timing behaviour of both types of pulses and a background rejection method based on the identification ( on an event - by - event basis ) of the nuclear recoils , by measuring at the same time two different mechanisms of energy deposition , like the ionization ( or scintillation ) and heat , capitalizing the fact that for a given deposited energy ( measured as phonons ) the recoiling nucleus ionizes less than the electrons .",
    "examples of psd are ukdmc , saclay , dama and anais , whereas the event by event discrimination has been successfully applied in cdms and edelweiss by measuring ionization and heat and now in cresst and rosebud by measuring light and heat .",
    "a promising discriminating technique is that used in the two - phase liquid - gas xenon detector with ionization plus scintillation , of the zeplin series of detectors .",
    "an electric field prevents recombination , the charge being drifted to create a second pulse in addition to the primary pulse .",
    "the amplitudes of both pulses are different for nuclear recoils and gammas allowing their discrimination .",
    "another technique is to discriminate gamma background from neutrons ( and so wimps ) using threshold detectors  like neutron dosimeters  which are blind to most of the low linear energy transfer ( let ) radiation ( e , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "detectors which use superheated droplets which vaporize into bubbles by the wimp ( or other high let particles ) energy deposition are simple and picasso . an ultimate discrimination will be the identification of the different kind of particles by the tracking they left in , say , a tpc , plus the identification of the wimp through the directional sensitivity of the device ( drift ) .",
    "obviously one should try to make detectors of very low energy threshold and high efficiency to see most of the signal spectrum , not just the tail .",
    "that is the case for the bolometer experiments which seen efficiently the energy delivered by the wimp ( quenching factor is unity ) , ( mibeta , cresst , rosebud , cuoricino , cdms and edelweiss ) .",
    "after the process of reducing and identifying the background is driven to its best , then one should search for distinctive signatures of the dark matter particles to prove that you are , indeed , seeing a wimp .",
    "identifying labels are derived from the earth motion through the galactic halo , which produces two assymetries distinctive of wimps : first , the earth orbital motion around the sun has a summer - winter variation which results in a small ( 5% ) annual modulation of the wimp interaction rates ; and second , the earth ( and solar system ) motion through the galactic centre produces a large ( @xmath14 ) directional assymetry forward - backward of the recoiling nucleus .",
    "the annual modulation signature has been already explored .",
    "pioneering searches for wimp annual modulation signals were carried out in canfranc ( nai-32 ) , kamioka ( elegants ) and gran sasso ( dama - xe ) .",
    "recently the dama experiment at gran sasso , using a set of nai scintillators reported in 1997 and 2000 an annual modulation effect of at the @xmath11 level interpreted as due to a wimp of about 60 gev of mass and scalar cross - section on protons of @xmath15 picobarns .",
    "as far as the forward - backward assymetry of the signal is concerned the drift project will search for it .",
    "information and current results of the experiments mentioned above can be found in references @xcite and @xcite .    in particular , in the underground facility of the canfranc tunnel ( spain ) , various of the techniques mentioned above",
    "are currently employed in a search for wimps@xcite : ge ionization detectors , ( cosme and igex ) , sodium iodine scintillators ( nai-32 and anais ) , thermal detectors with al@xmath16o@xmath17 and ge absorbers ( rosebud - i ) as well as and with calcium tungstate and bgo scintillating bolometers ( rosebud - ii ) . to illustrate how these searches proceed we will present the case for ge detectors , and",
    "will describe its status , achievements and results . as one of the main achievements in ge experiments",
    "is their low radioactive background , essential ingredient in the search for dark matter , we will illustrate it with a saga of germanium experiments performed in canfranc and the succesive suppresion of the background obtained .",
    "such reduction has provided the lowest raw background rate obtained so far and , consequently , the stringest exclussion plots ever derived with ionization detectors .",
    "the high radiopurity and low background achieved in germanium detectors , their fair low energy threshold , their reasonable quenching factor ( about 25% ) ( nuclear recoil ionization efficiency relative to that of electrons of the same kinetic energy , or ionization yield ) and other nuclear merits make germanium a good option to search for wimps with detectors and techniques fully mastered .",
    "the first detectors applied to wimp direct searches ( as early as in 1987 ) were , in fact , ge diodes , as by - products of @xmath18-decay dedicated experiments .",
    "the exclusion plots @xmath10(m ) for spin - independent couplings obtained by former ge experiments [ pnnl / usc / zaragoza ( twin @xcite and cosme-1@xcite@xcite ) , ucsb @xcite , calt / neu / psi @xcite , h / m @xcite ] are still remarkable and have not been surpassed till recently by nai experiments ( dama)@xcite using statistical pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) or by cryogenic experiments measuring both heat and ionization like cdms@xcite and edelweiss@xcite .",
    "table 5 shows the germanium ionization detector experiments currently in operation .",
    "a ge detector of natural isotopic abundance ( cosme ) of the u. zaragoza / u. s. carolina / pnnl collaboration and another one ( rg - ii ) made of enriched @xmath19ge of the igex collaboration are being used in canfranc to search for wimps interacting coherently with the ge nuclei of the detectors .",
    "the cosme detector was fabricated at princeton gamma - tech , inc . in princeton ,",
    "new jersey , using germanium of natural isotopic abundance .",
    "the refinement of newly - mined germanium ore to finished metal for this detector was expedited to minimize production of cosmogenic @xmath20ge .",
    "the detector is a p - type coaxial hyperpure natural germanium crystal with a mass of 254 g and an active mass of 234 g which has a long term resolution of 0.43 kev full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at the 10.37 kev gallium x - ray . in its first canfranc installation ( at 675 m.w.e )",
    "the detector was placed within a shielding of 10 cm of 2000 yr .",
    "old ( roman ) lead ( inner layer ) plus 20 cm of low activity lead ( about 70 yr old ) .",
    "a 3 mm thick pvc box sealed with silicone closed the lead shielding to purge the radon gas .",
    "the pvc box was covered by 1 mm of cadmium and 20 cm of paraffin and borated polyethylene . all the shielding and",
    "mounting was supported by 10 cm of vibrational and acoustic insulator sandwiched within two layers of 10 cm of wood mounted on a floor of concrete ( 20 cm ) .",
    "it was operated in the former canfranc underground facility at 675 m.w.e . in a small gallery of the canfranc railway tunnel in the spanish pyrenees closed to the traffic . in that set - up ,",
    "the energy threshold was @xmath21 kev and the background at threshold was about 10 counts kev@xmath22 kg@xmath22 day@xmath22 .",
    "after about 500 days of data taking ( referred as cosme-1 experiment ) no signal originated by wimp appeared and , from the background spectrum , an exclusion plot in the cross - section versus wimp masses plane was derived , assuming wimp - matter spin - independent couplings . in the cosme-1 data , the energy range chosen to derive the exclusion plot was from 1.6 to 8 kev where the background was , approximately , 5 counts/(kev kg day ) . in spite of such modest figure , the results after 130 kg day of exposure improved the exclusion plots at low masses ( from 9 to 20 gev ) obtained with other ge experiments because of the low threshold energy of cosme-1 .",
    "the cosme detector has been reinstalled , in better background conditions in the new canfranc underground laboratory lsc ( at 2450 m.w.e . ) inside a marinelli beaker in roman lead ( cosme-2 ) in a common shielding ( described later ) together with the three 2.1 kg enriched germanium detectors of igex ( the international germanium experiment on double beta decay ) . in its new installation , cosme-2 has an energy threshold of @xmath23 kev , and an energy resolution of @xmath24 kev at 10 kev .",
    "the average background rate , in 311 days of exposure ( mt=72.8 kg day ) is 0.6 c/(kev kg day ) from 2 to 15 kev and 0.3 c/(kev kg day ) from 15 to 30 kev which is significantly better ( more than one order of magnitude ) than in cosme-1 .",
    "the cosme-2 spectrum is shown in fig . [ fig_1 ] together with that of cosme-1 , to show the remarkable background reduction obtained in the new set - up and shielding and the disappearance of the cosmogenically induced peaks in the 8 - 10 kev energy region due to the about ten years elapsed between the two experiments .",

    "as recommended by the particle data group , the predicted signal in an energy bin is required to be less than or equal to the ( 90% c.l . )",
    "upper limit of the ( poisson ) recorded counts .",
    "the derivation of the interaction rate signal supposes that the wimps form an isotropic , isothermal , non - rotating halo of density @xmath26  gev/@xmath27 , have a maxwellian velocity distribution with @xmath28  km / s ( with an upper cut corresponding to an escape velocity of 650  km / s ) , and have a relative earth - halo velocity of @xmath29  km / s .",
    "the cross sections are normalized to the nucleon , assuming a dominant scalar interaction .",

    "the igex-2000 exclusion contour@xcite improves that of other germanium experiments for masses between 20 gev and 200 gev , which includes the mass region corresponding to the neutralino tentatively assigned to the dama modulation effect and results from using only raw data without background subtraction .",
    "the cosme-2@xcite@xcite exclusion contour also slightly improves the ge - combined plot for masses between 20 and 40 gev .",
    "then , a new set - up was constructed , with the purpose of further improving the background . in particular",

    "as it can be seen , the background below 10 kev has been substantially reduced ( about a factor 50% ) with respect to that obtained in the previous set - up of igex-2000 , essentially due to the improved shielding ( both in lead and in polyethylene - water).this suggests that the neutrons could be an important component of the low energy background in igex@xcite .    the new exclusion plot derived in this improved conditions igex-2001@xcite",

    "@xcite ( thin dotted line ) and the cdms expected sensitivity contour ( thin dot - dashed line)@xcite .    data collection is currently in progress and some strategies are being considered to further reduce the low energy background .",
    "another 50 % reduction from 4 kev to 10 kev ( which could be reasonably expected ) would allow to explore practically all the dama region in 1  kg  y of exposure . in the case of reducing the background down to the flat level of 0.04 c / kg / kev / day ( currently achieved by igex for energies beyond 20 kev )",
