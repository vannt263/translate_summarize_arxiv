    "the predicted torsional oscillation period cycle is significantly shorter than the observed period cycle .",
    "this might be explained by a difference between the surface and inner magnetic field .",
    "the surface field of hd  37776 is very complex @xcite , and it may decay over time as seen in magnetic stars found in open clusters @xcite .",
    "it is possible that part of the observed decay may be connected with equalization of the surface and inner magnetic field .",
    "however , it does not follow from the simulations that the surface field is stronger than the inner field @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , there are still other possibilities that can explain the observed period variations .",
    "besides that excluded by @xcite , the most relevant could be the tidal interaction with an orbiting low - mass body @xcite .",
    "for example , a possible scenario could include a low - mass object on a non - synchronized precessing orbit .",

    "the model presented in this paper includes only the basic physics describing the problem . moreover",
    ", we solve the wave equation for @xmath33 only . in reality , the internal magnetic field has a more complex structure , and stable internal magnetic fields are given by the combination of poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields ( see @xcite and @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "because the wave equation is specified on the field lines a more realistic field topology would lead to a lengthening of the oscillation period on each field line ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as the basic frequency differs on each field line , the basic frequency of the global mode will be given by a weighted average of individual frequency modes .",
    "the resulting phase mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may lead to the damping of oscillations , but since the individual peaks in the periodogram are rather broad ( see  fig .  [ cuvirven ] ) , we expect that the oscillations may still be observable .",
    "the magnetic field dominates the atmospheres of studied stars .",
    "therefore , their surface may resemble the crust of neutron stars forcing the individual field lines to oscillate with the same frequency .",
    "consequently , the variations of rotational period of cp stars may have the same explanation as quasi - periodic oscillations of neutron stars . in this case",
    "the frequencies of rotational period variations may be associated with turning points or edges of the mhd continuum @xcite or with normal oscillation modes @xcite .",
    "another problem is connected with existence of two shallow convection zones associated with local opacity enhancements inside massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , because these zones contain only a very small fraction of the stellar mass , we expect that their existence does not significantly alter our results .",
    "our model assumes small perturbations of otherwise uniform stellar angular velocity .",
    "this does not seem to be in contradiction with vertical differential rotation profiles derived from asteroseismology in ba stars @xcite .",
    "however , angular momentum transport by , e.g. , internal gravity waves @xcite may lead to damping of torsional oscillations .",
    "it is not clear what mechanism drives the torsional oscillations .",
    "the forcing mechanism may be connected either with the core convection zone or with winds blowing from the stellar surface .",
    "if some ap stars originate in binary star mergers @xcite , then subsequent relaxation processes may provide a convenient mechanism that drives the torsional oscillations .",
    "this would mean that cu  vir is a merger product .",
    "this could possibly provide a consistent explanation of circumstellar matter that is required to power the pulsed radio emission observed in cu vir @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation of line - driven wind mass - loss rate of about @xmath108 @xcite is problematic due to the low effective temperature of the star @xcite .",
    "the wave equation is linear and so allows oscillations with arbitrary amplitudes .",
    "this is unrealistic in nature , and several processes may lead to damping of strong oscillations .",
    "one obvious process is reconnection , which may occur in the case of oscillations that are wound up too much .",
    "the oscillations may also be damped due to vertical shear .",
    "another important question is connected with the fact that period variations are detected in only a handful of magnetic stars , while the light curves of most of them are adequately described with constant periods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while a lack of suitable long observing series may provide an obvious answer for many stars , more subtle reasons may be missing .",
    "since a similar question is not clearly resolved in many notorious classical pulsating stars , i.e. , the question why there are stars that do not pulsate in the instability strip ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we postpone this question for a future study .",
    "we simulated stellar torsional oscillations that result from the interaction of the internal magnetic field and differential rotation .",
    "the simulations were calculated for the chemically peculiar stars cu  vir and hd  37776 , which both have rotational period variations .",
    "we derived the internal structure of individual modes and calculated the wave resonance frequencies , for which the amplitudes of surface angular frequency variations are the largest . for each star we found a basic frequency and several high - order overtones .",
    "we provide a new analysis of period variations in the stars cu  vir and hd  37776 assuming periodic rotational period variations . for cu  vir",
    ", the length of the rotational period cycle @xmath0yr can be well reproduced by numerical models , which predict a cycle length of 51yr .",
    "the numerical model also predicts the variations on the scale of about 10  yr in agreement with observations .",
    "consequently , the torsional oscillations provide a reasonable explanation of the observed period variations of cu  vir . on the other hand , for hd  37776",
    "the observed lower limit of the period cycle , @xmath1yr , is significantly longer than the predicted cycle length of 5yr .",
    "it is immediately clear from the scaling of the wave equation with the magnetic field and from the observed strength of the field that the model can not reproduce the observations of both stars .",

    "<S> some chemically peculiar stars in the upper main sequence show rotational period variations of unknown origin . </S>",
    "<S> we propose these variations are a consequence of the propagation of internal waves in magnetic rotating stars that lead to the torsional oscillations of the star . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the magnetohydrodynamic waves and calculate resonant frequencies for two stars that show rotational variations : cu  vir and hd  37776 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide updated analyses of rotational period variations in these stars and compare our results with numerical models . for cu  vir , the length of the observed rotational - period cycle , @xmath0yr , can be well reproduced by the models , which predict a cycle length of 51yr </S>",
    "<S> . however , for hd  37776 , the observed lower limit of the cycle length , @xmath1yr , is significantly longer than the numerical models predict . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that torsional oscillations provide a reasonable explanation at least for the observed period variations in cu  vir .    </S>",
