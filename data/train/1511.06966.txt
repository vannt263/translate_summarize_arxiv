    "subsequently , several researchers have worked to develop a general theory of sds ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we draw most of our terminology and background information concerning sds from @xcite , a valuable reference for anyone interested in exploring this field .",
    "an sds is built from the following parts :    * an undirected simple graph @xmath0 with vertices @xmath1 . *",

    "our primary motivation for doing so stems from the following theorem from @xcite ; this theorem provides one reason why the maps @xmath98 and @xmath99 merit special attention in the theory of sds .",
