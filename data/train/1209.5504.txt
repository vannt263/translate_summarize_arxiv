    "<S> the restriction of the dynamics of the quadratic polynomial to the boundary of the siegel disk is known to be quasisymmetrically conjugate to the rigid rotation with the same rotation number . </S>",

    "<S> we provide an estimate on the quasisymmetric constant of the conjugacy , and use it to prove bounds on the scaling ratio @xmath0 of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the period of the continued fraction , and @xmath3 depends on the rotation number in an explicit way , while @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 depend only on the maximum of the integers in the continued fraction expansion of the rotation number . </S>"
