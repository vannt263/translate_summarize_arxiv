    "dust , droplets , bubbles , and other finite - size particles suspended in turbulent flows are common in nature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "their statistical properties are very different from that of tracers , i.e.  point - like particles with the same mass density as the advecting fluid . indeed , when the suspended particles have a finite size and a density different from that of the fluid , inertial effects become important .",
    "consequently , the motion of particles starts differing from the underlying flow .",
    "this results in intricate correlations between the particle positions and the geometry of the turbulent flow .",
    "heavier particles are expelled from vortical structures while lighter particles concentrate in their cores .",
    "a consequence of these mechanisms is the presence of strong fluctuations in the spatial distribution of particles .",
    "this phenomenon , known as _ preferential concentration _ , has been the subject of extensive research in fluid dynamics for the last decades ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another consequence of inertia is that particles are likely to be very close to each other with large velocity differences .",
    "the process leading to such events , known either as the sling effect @xcite or the formation of caustics @xcite , has been extensively measured and studied during the past ten years ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of such spatial inhomogeneities is known to strongly alter possible interactions between particles . since the pioneering work of @xcite motivated by coalescences of cloud droplets , much work has been devoted to understanding the rate at which heavy inertial particles collide . a commonly adopted approach consists in assuming that the inter - collision time is much longer than the convergence timescale of particle dynamics to a statistically stationary regime .",
    "this premise , which is asymptotically true in the limit of very dilute suspensions , entitles counting collisions without having to effectively perform them .",
    "the frequency at which such _ ghost particles _ collide is then a time - independent statistical observables that can be quantified as a function of particle sizes and response times .",
    "several studies have assumed this ghost - particle hypothesis in order to estimate collision rates of heavy inertial particles in turbulent flows ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , little is known about the limits of such an approach .",
    "for instance , an important statistical weight is given to events when two concentrated clouds of particles cross each other with a large velocity difference .",
    "it is clear that the very - dilute approximation should then fail and that multiple - collisions are likely to occur .",
    "we report in this paper results on the effects of actual collisions on the dynamics and statistics of inertial particles transported by a non - stationary fluid flow .",
    "the simplest framework for treating short - range collective effects in the particle dynamics is to consider an ensemble of hard spheres that are suspended in a prescribed flow and which undergo purely elastic ( momentum and energy preserving ) collisions with each other .",
    "such a system , in the absence of any underlying fluid transport , has long been a paradigmatic model in statistical mechanics .",
    "it is the basis of the kinetic theory of gasses , in which it is assumed that the kinetic energy is conserved both by the collisions and by the dynamics of each particle .",
    "if we allow for a certain amount of inelasticity in the collisions a suitable model for granular gasses is obtained  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review )",
    ". a peculiar behaviour of such granular systems is the spontaneous aggregation of particles .",
    "since inelasticity implies the loss of a finite percentage of kinetic energy at each collision , the particles can eventually stick together leading to the formation of large clusters .",
    "however , this effect occurs also in settings that are not common in studies of granular media . indeed , as we will see in this work",
    ", it suffices that kinetic energy dissipation occurs not via collisions but rather through individual particle dynamics .",
    "this is the case for heavy inertial particles whose motion is dominated by viscous damping and which undergo purely elastic collisions .",
    "we show that the clustering phenomenon emerging in such systems originates from what we call _ sticky elastic collisions_. during these events , the particles bounce many times against each other and energy is dissipated during their motion between successive collisions .",
    "this mechanism has strong influences on the statistics of inter - particle distances and relative velocities .",
    "furthermore , to validate the presence of this effect in real settings , we study the influence of hydrodynamic interactions and show that they can not prevent sticky elastic collisions from occurring .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the equations of motion of the inertial particles and recall some key results , in the absence of any collisions , on preferential concentration . in  [ sec : sticky ] , we present numerical results and provide an asymptotic analysis for the phenomenon of sticky elastic collisions in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "we then discuss the effect of hydrodynamic interactions in  [ sec : hydro ] by considering far  field interactions .",
    "we make some concluding remarks and summarise our results , as well as provide a perspective for future work , in  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "to set the stage , we begin by recalling the basic physics of a system of @xmath0 small hard spheres which are in a random , time - dependent , incompressible fluid field @xmath1 and are subject to viscous dissipation .",
    "when such particles have a small reynolds number and are much heavier than the fluid , they interact with the flow by stokes viscous drag and their trajectories @xmath2 are determined by newton s law : @xmath3\\;\\;\\ ; i \\in [ 1,n ] \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the viscous - drag relaxation ( stokes ) time defined via @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the particle density , @xmath7 the fluid density , @xmath8 its kinematic viscosity , and @xmath9 is the particle radius .",
    "the stokes number is a measure of the inertia of the particle and is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a characteristic timescale of the fluid flow . in this work , we additionally introduce interactions between particles in the following sense .",
    "the particles interact through elastic collisions which , for the case of spherical particles of equal size and mass , correspond to an exchange of the radial component of the velocities of the two colliding particles upon impact , namely when @xmath12 .    the clustering phenomenon occurs naturally , independently of the carrier flow compressibility , for an ensemble of particles which evolve according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , even in the absence of interactions or collisions between particles .",
    "we note that the case of no collisions is equivalent to the ghost particle approach .",
    "the physical mechanisms which lead to strong inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of particles arise from the underlying dissipative chaotic dynamics : the system is characterised by a constant contraction rate @xmath13 in the position - velocity phase space which drives the particles towards a dynamically evolving fractal set  the clusters of particles are the projection of such fractals on the position space .",
    "the fractal dimensions of particles distribution provide a convenient tool to quantify their clustering ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular the correlation dimension @xmath14 is defined via the power - law behaviour of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of inter - particle distances @xmath15 ( see the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : pdf_no_hydro]a for particles with different stokes numbers in a three - dimensional random flow ) . note that the density @xmath16 is such that the probability that two particles are at a distance between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is @xmath19 and relates to the radial distribution function @xmath20 : in three dimensions , one has @xmath21 .",
    "the intensity of clustering is influenced by the properties of the velocity field @xmath1 and in particular by its spatial and temporal correlations .",
    "here we will assume that the velocity is differentiable in space and time and characterised by unique time and length scales .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the fluid flow correlation length , which is assumed much larger than the particle radius @xmath9 , and by @xmath11 its correlation time , which is of the same order as the turnover time @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the typical amplitude of @xmath25 . in the limit of vanishing dissipation @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) becomes that of tracers , namely @xmath27 , and the incompressibility condition @xmath28 ensures a uniform distribution of particles .",
    "particles distribute uniformly also in the opposite limit @xmath29 , in which the force acting on particles become very small so that they follow almost a ballistic motion and fill the whole position - velocity phase - space .",
    "the maximum of clustering is achieved for intermediate ( order - unity ) values of @xmath30 where the minimum of the fractal dimension is reached .",
    "clearly , the presence of collisions will affect the particle distribution on scales of the order of their size .",
    "heuristically , one expects the two - particle distribution @xmath16 to be unchanged at separations @xmath17 much larger than the interaction distance @xmath31 . at separations of the order of @xmath31 , the elastic collisions decorrelate the particle dynamics from the carrier flow",
    "naively , one would then expect that the particles distribute like an ideal gas at such scales , and consequently have a uniform distribution",
    ". in dilute systems , the crossover between these two regimes would occur at a scale given by the distance travelled by the particles before it relaxes to its attractor .",
    "this distance can be written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the typical velocity difference at collisions . however , as seen from the inset of fig .",

    "nevertheless , our data show a monotonic convergence towards @xmath61 .",
    "these two asymptotic values of the exponent are signatures of two different collision mechanisms .    for large stokes numbers the motion of particles is weakly correlated with the local values of the fluid velocity field , because it is determined by the cumulative contributions of the flow integrated over the particle trajectories with a long memory kernel .",
    "close to the collision distance individual particle velocities are almost uncorrelated and vary on very large timescales .",
    "the relative motion of the two particles is therefore almost ballistic , with a random relative velocity .",
    "the time that the two particles spend at a distance between @xmath17 and @xmath18 is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a their typical velocity difference .",
    "this leads to @xmath64 thus yielding @xmath65 when @xmath66 .",
    "the limit @xmath60 is more complicated . in this case",
    "the motion of the particles is strongly correlated with the fluid velocity field @xmath25 , and therefore particles typically arrive at colliding distances with a very small relative velocity , of the order of the fluid velocity difference , namely @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the local gradient of @xmath25 .",
    "after the collision they tend to separate but the fluid velocity field quickly brings them back together , because of the short relaxation time @xmath69 .",
    "particles then collide again and this mechanism will , therefore , lead to a long series of high - frequency collisions during which the particle remain within a distance of the order of @xmath31 . next , to quantify the effects of these events on the statistics of inter - particle distance ,",
    "let us consider a simple , one dimensional model for the separation @xmath70 and the radial relative velocity @xmath71 of two particles , between two collisions occurring at time @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the equations of motion can be written as @xmath74 here , we have assumed that the fluid velocity gradient @xmath75 remains constant .",
    "this is justified because particle dynamics is much faster than the correlation time of the fluid velocity ( @xmath76 ) .",

    "introducing the small parameter @xmath81 and taylor expanding the above expressions for @xmath82 one obtains a recursive relation for the relative velocity at collision , namely @xmath83 , which leads to @xmath84 .",
    "the inter - collision time @xmath85 decreases as @xmath86 , and the maximum distance @xmath87 reached by the two particles in the excursion between two collisions scales as @xmath88 .",
    "the number of collisions increases exponentially in time @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , and the inter - particles distance goes to 0 .",
    "we call this phenomenon _ sticky elastic collisions_. note that the series defined by the sum of inter - collision times @xmath91 is not converging .",
    "this ensures that the number of collisions does not become infinite in a finite time , at variance with the case for inelastic collisions where the particles eventually collapse and aggregate . in the case of the one - dimensional sticky elastic collisions , the recurrent process stops only when the fluid velocity gradient becomes positive ( for @xmath92 ) and takes the two particles far away . during any one of these events",
    ", only the first @xmath93 collisions will contribute to the probability of having the two particles at a distance larger than @xmath94 .",
    "the fraction of time spent at a distance larger that @xmath17 is thus @xmath95 .",
    "this gives for the pdf of inter - particle distances @xmath96 , yielding the asymptotic value @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "the heuristic arguments developed here to quantify the statistical signature of sticky events are purely one - dimensional . however , they extend to higher dimensions by geometrical considerations .",
    "the one - dimensional case would hold true if the velocity difference @xmath99 between the particles were exactly aligned with their separation @xmath100 .",
    "a misalignment leads to rebounds of the two particles at different locations on their surfaces . for spherical particles",

    "we have checked the scaling becomes significantly shallower and the extent of scaling gets progressively reduced with @xmath30 increases .",
    "note that a similarly steep increase of the inter - collision time distribution at small values has been observed by @xcite in full direct numerical simulations of finite - size particles suspended in a viscous flow .",
    "this effect has been interpreted as a possible consequence of lubrication forces between the particles that makes the particles remain close to each other for long times . in the next section , we will comment on the influence of hydrodynamical interactions on sticky elastic collisions .",
    "nevertheless it is worth stressing here that lubrication is not necessary to obtain multiple collisions between particles .",
    "the tails of @xmath107 and @xmath108 at small values seem to indicate that they can not be normalised .",
    "however , we observe for small but finite values of @xmath30 , a cutoff at the smallest values of @xmath33 and @xmath103 , which prevents this divergence . indeed , the power - law behaviours are due to typical sticky events . as we have seen , the number of collisions is of the order of @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the minimal collisional velocity and inter - collision time are both @xmath111 .",
    "the power - law is thus just appearing in intermediate ranges , namely @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the events leading to values smaller than the lower bounds are related to situations where the fluid velocity gradient is maintained negative for an exceptionally long time .",
    "this happens with an inverse - gaussian probability in a finite - correlation - time flow , whence the cutoff . also , the extension of this argument to the singular limit @xmath114 is far from obvious .",
    "note finally that in dimensions higher than one , the geometrical considerations explained above should also provide a cut - off for very small collision times and velocities .",
    "in this section , we address the question whether or not sticky elastic collisions can be observed in realistic flows . for that , it is important to know how far the observations and conclusions drawn above are valid when we , in addition to collisions , introduce hydrodynamic interactions between particles . to answer this question ,",
    "we take into account the far  field or long  range interactions and assume that it is valid all the way to the smallest separations .",
    "this approach yields several interesting results which we discuss below .",
    "of course this assumption , in reality , breaks down when particles approach _ very _ close to one other .",
    "however in that case , either lubrication leads to an effective increase in the particle physical radius or , in the case when the velocity difference is too large , hydrodynamics might not be a valid description of the interactions between the particles .    in its simplest formulation ,",
    "the long  range hydrodynamic interactions between particles in a flow is taken into account by considering the perturbation in the ambient fluid velocity field , as experienced by an individual particle , because of the motion of all the other particles .",
    "thus the effective velocity field acting on any particle is a superposition of the unperturbed ( turbulent ) advecting flow @xmath115 and of the perturbation to this flow due to the other particles .",
    "formally , this perturbation @xmath116 on the _ isolated _ @xmath117th particle due to another particle @xmath118 of radius @xmath9 at a distance @xmath119 and moving with a velocity @xmath120 can be written as a combination of a stokeslet and a potential dipole flow as follows ( see * ? ? ?",

    "given the structure of the equations , for a system of @xmath0 particles , it is impossible to solve exactly the perturbation field . thus various approximations and iterative schemes become essential .",
    "however , in the present problem being studied in this paper , which involves two particles only , it is possible to solve exactly the hydrodynamic interaction term as it involves merely an inversion of a 6 @xmath123 6 matrix .",
    "let us now try to understand the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the particle dynamics from a theoretical point of view . without any loss of generality , and considering only two - particle interactions , let us consider a model where the two particles approach each other with the same velocity @xmath99 .",
    "a direct consequence of this model is that the perturbation @xmath124 on particle 1 due to particle 2 is equal and opposite to the perturbation @xmath125 on particle 2 due to particle 1 , i.e.  @xmath126 .",

    "our results seem to indicate that the most significant effect at small scales of such interactions is to introduce an effective stokes number .",
