    "qubit systems @xcite are conventionally described in symmetric tensor products of the two dimensional complex hilbert spaces .",

    "it means that tensor product of qubit states is symmetric .",
    "qubit from this point of view exhibits mixture of the boson and fermion properties .",
    "only separated qubit is like a fermion . to adequately describe qubits we have to play with the commutation or anticommutation relations on the one side , and symmetry properties of the tensor product on the other side .",
    "bosons and fermions can be organized in unique graded structure where commutators , anticommutators , parity of elements of graded algebra , and symmetry of tensor product is consistent .",
    "they play distinguished role , because they describe fundamental particles . however , there are other useful objects related to parastatistics .",
    "parafermions and parabosons were defined by tri - linear relations in ref . @xcite over fifty years ago and have their place in quantum field theory @xcite . here in our introductory discussion",
    "we use the reduced bi - linear form of these relations , that is satisfactory for our purposes , but less general then tree - linear relations . such reduced form is used in the entries of the table [ cr ] concerning parafermions and parabosons . a nice discussion of the definition of the qubit , stressing that qubits are neither bosons nor fermions , is given by wu and lidar @xcite .",
    "we departure from their definition of qubit as a parafermion , but find it more useful to reformulate defining conditions using the commutator and nilpotency conditions .",

    "namely , @xmath37 this provides that single qubit is two - level one , in the same time it is boson - like when considered in multi - qubit system . in the approach , where the qubits are realized within the conventionally defined spin algebra ( parafermions ) , natural classical limit of such system yields the anticommuting co - ordinates @xcite , like for fermions",
    "such anticommuting coordinates imply naturally the antisymmetry of the tensor product , and nilpotent `` bosonic '' objects again have to be represented by even product of anticommuting variables .",

    "that nilpotent commuting variables are very useful tool in the description of entanglement .",
    "one may think that such formalism has deeper roots , and like for fermions one can consider ( pseudo)classical systems of superparticles , then quantize them . here",
    "we should have the formalism of nilpotent mechanics for systems that after quantization will give the ( quantum ) qubit systems .",
    "nilpotent commuting variables , besides the quantum mechanics @xcite , are present in the theoretical physics in several contexts : nuclear and high energy physics , string theory @xcite , as well as in metioned before classical nilpotent mechanics .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the qubit system in such a way that it has the proposed above classical limit realized by the commuting nilpotent coordinates @xmath0 .",
    "then necessary formalism based on @xmath0-coordinates is presented .",
    "we recall definition of the @xmath0-numbers , @xmath0-functions @xcite and then develop it by studying properties of the elementary @xmath0-functions , in particular : exponent , logarithm , and trigonometric functions .",
    "it turns out that the stirling numbers , the ordered bell numbers , and the second kind bell numbers are related to the expansions of specific @xmath0-functions .",
    "the following section we devote to the introduction of the symmetric @xmath0-polynomials and hermite @xmath0-polynomials .",
    "then the rudiments of the @xmath0-calculus are given with the @xmath0-integral , the @xmath0-fourier transform as well as the @xmath0-integral form of the stirling and the normal bell numbers .",
    "having above tools we introduce the notion of the @xmath39-hilbert space which will allow to describe qubit systems .",
    "using the @xmath0-integral we define the @xmath39-scalar product in the space of the @xmath0-functions ( wave @xmath0-functions ) and the structure of the @xmath39-hilbert space .",
    "it turns out that natural bases in such spaces are closely related to the ones used in the description of the entanglement of qubit systems . here , such bases have natural geometrical meaning .",
    "we also present @xmath0-kernels of some basic operators acting in @xmath39-hilbert space .    in the @xmath39-hilbert space of the wave @xmath0-functions",
    "one can consider the generalized schrdinger equation .",
    "formerly , such equation , but in a different form ( logarithmic form ) , was proposed by mandiliara et al .",
    "@xcite . in the section [ 2comp ] we study twocomponent nilpotent systems and the eigenvalue problem for qubit system covering various types of couplings ( ising , xy etc . ) .",
    "it is interesting that the set of eigenvector for these systems is composed of the bell vectors .",
    "there are also considered composed systems of the qubit and boson , the qubit and fermion , and the qubit - qubit . as specially interesting",
    "we find the qubit - fermion system with the supersymmetry acting between two nilpotent parts .    in the sec .",
    "[ sep ] there is addressed question of the separability of the @xmath0-variable dependence of the @xmath0-functions and a `` duality '' of such notion to the entanglement . in the conventional function theory ,",
    "the separability questions are answered using the appropriate wronskians @xcite .",
    "here we find that there can be considered special generalizations of wronski matrices , and that their traces and determinants serve as a tool to detect the conditions for separability of functions .",
    "what is remarkable , one can express relevant invariants known from the general theory and entanglement monotones used in recent works on entanglement , in terms of wronskians .",
    "this gives additional insight into the structure or flavor of entanglement . in the description",
    "we follow the number of qubits , @xmath1 . in the present work we answer only the question of the pure state entanglement .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec.[concl ] .",
    "the work is accompanied with several appendices containing relevant auxiliary material and derivations of important facts .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction we shall follow wu and lidar , and by the qubit we denote a two - level quantum object with encoded boson - like behavior in many particle system , and in the same time , underlying the pauli exclusion principle . as it was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite such a somehow hybrid object is not a fundamental particle , like boson or fermion and inherently carries properties of a composed object , but it can be described without any explicit reference to the constituents and the way it is composed of .",
    "the formalism we develop provides independent description of the qubit itself and gives very convenient characterization of qubit pure state entanglement .",
    "the nilpotent commuting variables were already used in the context of entanglement by maniliara at al . in @xcite .    in the analogous way as the fermion and fermionic states are understood , one can define the qubit system by means of the so called linear commutation relations to have on the same footing canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) , canonical anticommutation relations ( car ) and canonical qubit relations ( cqr ) . to take into account boson - like behavior of qubit",
    "we prefer to use only commutators , and realize the pauli exclusion principle , imposing nilpotency conditions without referring to anticommutators .",
    "such defined object is parafermionic , but the form of relations stresses its boson - like properties .",
    "this is also important from the point of view of supersymmetry .",

    "using for the cqr the argument of wu and lidar ( @xcite ) one can see that the set of @xmath38 qubits for the large @xmath38 behaves like a boson .",

    "we want to realize the cqr relations in the space of functions of the commuting nilpotent variables @xmath0 , what suggests the classical limit considered in the introduction .",
    "because of the nilpotency of the @xmath0-variables we can expect some similarities to the superanalysis , but this two formalisms are different .",
