    "cavity optomechanics , exploring the interaction between light fields and mechanical motions , has attracted a lot of attention in the past few years for its potential application in the ultrasensitive detection of tiny mass , force , and displacement @xcite .",
    "one standard and simplest optomechanical setup is a fabry - perot cavity with one end mirror being a micro- or nano - mechanical vibrating object @xcite . other various optomechanical experimental system are designed and investigated such as silica toroidal optical microresonators @xcite , photonic crystal cavities @xcite , micromechanical membranes @xcite , typical optomechanical cavities confining cold atoms @xcite , superconducting circuits @xcite , and so on .    typically , when driving an otomechanical cavity by a red - detuned laser , the mechanical oscillator can be cooled to its quantum ground - state @xcite . moreover , in this red - detuned regime , some well - known phenomena in atomic ensemble can find their analogy in optomechanical system . specifically , under a strong driving , normal mode splitting @xcite(called autler - townes effects in atomic physics ) can be observed . on the contrary , for a relatively weak driving ( much less than the cavity dissipation rate ) , an electromagnetically induced transparency like phenomenon , called optomechanically induced transparency@xcite , has been theoretically predict and experimentally verified .",
    "this phenomenon can be used to slow down and even stop light signals @xcite in the long - lived mechanical vibrations . on the other hand ,",
    "when a driving laser applied on the mechanical blue sideband , the mechanical element of an optomecanical system can be heated , leading to phonon lasing @xciteand probe amplification @xcite",
    ".    in our previous work , we have investigated coherent perfect transmission and absorption in a double - cavity optomechanical system driven by two pump fields on red mechanical sideband @xcite .",
    "while in this paper , we study the optomechanically induced amplification and perfect transparency in the same system driven under a different type of drive . we find that if driving the double - cavity optomechanical system by a red sideband laser from one side and a blue sideband one from the other side and appropriately manipulating the amplitudes of them , optomechanically induced amplification phenomenon can occur for a nearly resonant weak signal field ( probe field ) .",
    "in addition , by adjusting the control fields , an interesting perfect optomechanically induced transparency ( with transmission coefficient rigorously equal to 1 ) can be realized under the same type of drive .",
    "when this perfect transmission occur , quantum coherence process due to the double - driving can totally suppress the decoherence due to the dissipation of mechanical resonator .",
    "this double - driving device could be used to realize signal quantum amplifier , quantum switch , quantum memory and so on .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the double - cavity optomechanical model , obtain the equations of motion for the mechanical resonator and the two cavity modes , and solve them and obtain the output fields . in section iii , we show how to realize perfect optomechanically induced transparency even though with big mechanical decay rate @xmath0 . in section iv , we show how to realize optomechanically induced amplification about the weak signal field ( probe field ) , meanwhile , the system holds below the phonon lasing threshold . and",
    "the conclusions are given in the section v.",
    "and mode frequencies @xmath1 in the absence of radiation pressure . coupling field and driving field with frequencies @xmath2 and",
    "amplitudes @xmath3 respectively , act upon opposite sides of the double - cavity system . the probe field with frequency @xmath4 and amplitude @xmath5",
    "is injected into the left optical cavity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we consider a double - cavity hybrid system with one mechanical resonator ( mr ) of perfect reflection inserted between two fixed mirrors of partial transmission ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the mr has an eigen frequency @xmath6 and a decay rate @xmath0 and thus exhibits a mechanical quality factor @xmath7 .",
    "two identical optical cavities of lengths @xmath8 and frequencies @xmath1 are got when the mr is at its equilibrium position in the absence of external excitation .",
    "we describe the two optical modes , respectively , by annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) while the only mechanical mode by @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these annihilation and creation operators are restricted by the commutation relation @xmath15=1 $ ] ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17=0 $ ] , and @xmath18=1 $ ] .",
    "two coupling fields are used to drive the double - cavity system from either left or right fixed mirrors with their amplitudes denoted by @xmath19 and @xmath20 and one probe field is injected into the left optical cavity with amplitude denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "here @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are relevant field powers ,  @xmath25 is the common decay rate of both cavity modes , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath4 , are relevant field frequencies .",
    "then the total hamiltonian in the rotating - wave frame of frequency @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 with @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) being the detuning between cavity modes and coupling field ( driving field ) , @xmath32 being the detuning between the probe field and the coupling field , and @xmath33 being the hybrid coupling constant between mechanical and optical modes .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by the quantum langevin equations for relevant annihilation operators of mechanical and optical modes@xmath34c_{1}+\\varepsilon_{c}+\\varepsilon_{p}e^{-i\\delta t}+\\sqrt{2\\kappa}c_{1}^{in},\\nonumber\\\\ \\dot{c}_{2 }   &   = -[\\kappa+i\\delta_{d}+ig_{0}(b^{\\dagger}+b)]c_{2}+\\varepsilon_{d}+\\sqrt{2\\kappa}c_{2}^{in}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 being the thermal noise on the mr with zero mean value , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the input quantum vacuum noise from the left ( right ) cavity with zero mean value .",
    "because we deal with the mean response of the system , we do not include these noise terms in the discussion that follows . in the absence of probe field @xmath5 , eq.s ( 2 ) can be solved with the factorization assumption @xmath38 to generate the steady - state mean values@xmath39 with @xmath40 denoting the effective detunings between cavity modes and coupling field , driving field when the membrane oscillator deviates from its equilibrium position .",
    "note in particular , that @xmath41 is typically very small as compared to @xmath6 and becomes even exactly zero in the case of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .    in the presence of probe field , however , we can write each operator as the sum of its mean value and its small fluctuation ( @xmath44 ) to solve eq . ( 2 ) when the coupling field and the driving field are sufficiently strong . then keeping only the linear terms of fluctuation operators and moving into an interaction picture by introducing @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , we obtain the linearized quantum langevin equations@xmath48 if the coupling field drives at the mechanical red sideband while the driving field drives at the blue sideband ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , the hybrid system is operating in the resolved sideband regime ( @xmath51 ) , the membrane oscillator has a high mechanical quality factor ( @xmath52 ) , and the mechanical frequency @xmath6 is much larger than @xmath53 and @xmath54 , eq.s ( 4 ) will be simplified to @xmath55 with @xmath56",
    ". we can examine the expectation values of small fluctuations by the following three coupled dynamic equations @xmath57 we assume the steady - state solutions of above equations have form : @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "then it is straightforward to obtain the following results @xmath60}{(\\kappa - ix)^{2}(\\frac{\\gamma_{m}}{2}-ix)+g^{2}(1-n^{2})(\\kappa - ix)},\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta c_{2- } &   = \\frac{-ng^{2}\\varepsilon_{p}}{(\\kappa+ix)^{2}(\\frac { \\gamma_{m}}{2}+ix)+g^{2}(1-n^{2})(\\kappa+ix)},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the effective optomechanical coupling rate and @xmath62 is the photon number ratio of two cavity modes . in deriving eqs .",
    "( 7 ) , we have also assumed that @xmath63 is real - valued without loss of generality .    based on eqs .",
    "( 7 ) , we can further determine the left - hand output field @xmath64 and the right - hand output field @xmath65 through the following input - output relation @xcite @xmath66    where the oscillating terms can be removed if we set @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "note that the output components @xmath69 and @xmath70 have the same frequency @xmath4  as the input probe fields @xmath5 , while the output components @xmath71 and @xmath72 are generated at frequencies @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , in a nonlinear wave - mixing process of optomechanical interaction . then with eqs .",
    "( 8) we can obtain @xmath75 oscillating at frequency @xmath4 of our special interest .    in this paper , we discuss the perfect optomechanically induced amplification and transparency under the realistic parameters in a optomechanical experiment @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath76 mm , @xmath77 ng , @xmath78 khz , @xmath79 khz , and @xmath80 hz . in addition , the laser wavelength is @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 nm and the mechanical quality factor is @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "now we study the perfect optomechanically induced transparency for the probe field .",
    "the quadrature of the optical components with frequency @xmath4 in the output field can be defined as @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "specifically , it can be written as    @xmath87}{(\\kappa - ix)^{2}(\\frac{\\gamma_{m}}{2}-ix)+g^{2}(1-n^{2})(\\kappa - ix)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    whose real and imaginary part ( @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 $ ] ) represent the absorptive and dispersive behavior of the optomechanical system , respectively .",
    "it is well - known that in a standard optomechanical system with single optical cavity , the optomechanically induced transparency dip is not perfect as the decay @xmath0 of the mechanical resonator is not zero .",
    "however , we can see from eq.(10 ) that , in the double - cavity optomechanical system studied here , if setting the ratio @xmath90 , the optomechanically induced transparency dip will be perfect even though remarkale mechanical decay @xmath0 exists .     vs. the normalized frequency detuning @xmath91 : @xmath92 ( red - dashed ) and @xmath93 ( black - solid ) with @xmath94 khz and @xmath95 .",
    "in the inset : @xmath93 , @xmath80 hz and @xmath95.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     vs. the normalized frequency detuning @xmath91 : @xmath92 ( red - dashed ) and @xmath93 ( black - solid ) with @xmath94 khz and @xmath95.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to see this clearly , in fig .",
    "2 , we plot the @xmath88 $ ] versus the normalized frequency @xmath91 with @xmath94 khz and @xmath95 for different @xmath96 .",
    "we can see form fig .",
    "2 that when @xmath92 ( i.e. the usual optomechanically induced transparency case ) , the optomechanically induced transparency dip will become shallow with a large mechanical decay @xmath0 ( red - dashed ) .",
    "however , when an additional blue - sideband driving field satisfying the condition @xmath97 applied , the transparency dip will become perfect , exhibiting totally transmission of probe laser ( black - solid ) .",
    "physically , it means that the dissipative energy through the decay @xmath0 of the mechanical resonator can be compensated by applying the right - hand driving field with amplitude @xmath98 and the blue mechanical sideband frequency .",
    "when @xmath99 , @xmath90 and the beat frequency @xmath100 , thus , the mr is driven by a force oscillating at its eigenfrequency @xmath6 and the resonator starts to oscillate coherently .",
    "this motion will generate photons with frequency @xmath4 that interfere destructively with the probe beam , leading to a optomechanically induced transparency dip .    in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the the dispersion curve @xmath89 $ ] versus the normalized frequency @xmath91 with @xmath94 khz and @xmath95 for different @xmath96 .",
    "clearly , the curve with @xmath93 ( black - solid ) is much steeper than the one with @xmath92 ( red - dashed ) in the vicinity of @xmath101 .",
    "it means that we can easily control the dispersive behavior of the optomechanical system by applying the blue - detuned driving field with amplitude @xmath102 , which can possibly be used to control slow light in optomechanical systems .",
    "in this section , we study the optomechanically induced amplification in this double - cavity optomechanical system . if the ratio @xmath103 , we find the @xmath104 $ ] will become negative in the vicinity of @xmath101 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "it means that optomechanically induced gain ( amplification ) can be realized in this double - cavity system by applying a blue - detuned driving field to the right - side cavity with amplitude @xmath102 .",
    "note that when the system works under the condition @xmath101 , @xmath105 , @xmath104 $ ] will be divergent .",
    "in addition , the system will work into the parametric instability regime as @xmath106 when the input power @xmath107mw , and so we limit ourselves to the case where @xmath108 .     vs. the normalized frequency detuning @xmath91 : @xmath92 ( black - dotted ) , @xmath93 ( green - dotted - dashed ) , @xmath109 ( blue - dashed ) , and @xmath110 ( red - solid ) with @xmath111 . in the inset , we plot the normalized mechanical oscillation @xmath112 vs. the ratio @xmath96.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the mechanical oscillation @xmath112 ( normalized to probe field @xmath5 ) versus the normalized frequency @xmath91 for different @xmath96 . in the inset",
    "we plot the @xmath112 as a function of @xmath96 for @xmath101 .",
    "it can be seen clearly from fig .",
    "4 that the mechanical oscillation peak value locates at @xmath101 , and increases with @xmath96 [ @xmath92 ( black - dotted ) , @xmath93 ( green - dotted - dashed ) , @xmath109 ( blue - dashed ) , @xmath110 ( red - solid ) ] . and when @xmath96 increases up to 1 , the mechanical oscillation peak value will increase approximately to @xmath113 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "it means that the optomechanical effect will become stronger for bigger @xmath96 ( less than or equal to 1 ) when @xmath100 and @xmath114 .",
    "the reason for this is that , the blue - mechanical sideband ( heating sideband ) of right - hand cavity generating much phonons which will be absorbed by the anti - stokes processes in left - hand cavity for the red - mechanical sideband ( cooling sideband ) .",
    "then , the optomechanical effect of the double - cavity system is resonantly enhanced .     vs. the normalized frequency detuning @xmath91 : @xmath92 ( black - dotted ) , @xmath93 (",
    "green - dotted - dashed ) , @xmath109 ( blue - dashed ) , and @xmath110 ( red - solid ) with @xmath111 . in the inset , we plot the normalized output energy @xmath115 vs. the ratio @xmath96.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     vs. the normalized frequency detuning @xmath91 : the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "4 . in the inset , we plot the normalized output energy @xmath116 vs. the ratio @xmath96.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig .",
    "5 - 6 , we plot the output power @xmath117 and @xmath118 normalized to the input probe field @xmath5 respectively , versus the normalized frequency @xmath91 for different @xmath96 .",
    "it can be seen clearly from fig .",
    "5 - 6 that the output energies @xmath115 and @xmath118 get the maximum value at @xmath101 for a certain value @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath101 , the output normalized energies @xmath119 and @xmath118 will increase with @xmath96 which is similar to the mechanical oscillation @xmath112 .",
    "this is because that when @xmath101 , the optomechanical effect will be strongest for a certain value @xmath96 as discussed above .",
    "the curves of the output normalized energies @xmath115 and @xmath118 almost have the same line shape , except that the output normalized energy @xmath115 starts from 1 with the increase of @xmath96 for @xmath101 while the output normalized energy @xmath118 starts from 0 ( see the insets in fig . 5 - 6 ) .",
    "this shows that the double - cavity optomechanical system will be reduced to the standard one - cavity optomechanical model ( @xmath120 ) when @xmath92 .",
    "when @xmath96 increases up to 1 , the output normalized energies @xmath115 and @xmath118 will increase approximately to @xmath121 ( see the insets in fig .",
    "the reason for this is that , the existing of blue - detuned driving field with @xmath114 will coherently enhance the oscillation of the mr ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , leading to optomechanically induced amplification .",
    "thus , we can realize the optomechanically induced amplification for a resonantly injected probe in the double - cavity optomechanical system by appropriately adjusting the ratio @xmath96 of the two strong field amplitudes @xmath122 .",
    "in summary , we have studied in theory a double - cavity optomechanical system driven by a red sideband laser from one side and a blue sideband one from the other side .",
    "our analytical and numerical results show that if adjusting the amplitude - ratio of the two driving fields @xmath103 , the optomechanically induced amplification for a resonantly incident probe ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) can be realized in this system .",
    "typically , remarkable amplification can be obtained when @xmath124 .",
    "the reason for this is that , the stokes processes in the blue - sideband driven cavity can generate phonons in the mechanical elements , and these phonons will be further absorbed by the anti - stokes processes in the red - sideband driven cavity . as a result ,",
    "the optomechanical effect of the double - cavity system is resonantly enhanced .",
    "in addition , the perfect optomechanically induced transparency can be realized if we set the ratio @xmath125 .",
    "different from usual optomechanical induced transparency , this phenomenon is robust to mechanical dissipation , namely , the perfect transparency window can preserve even if the mechanical resonator has a relatively large decay rate @xmath0 .",
    "we expect that our study can be used to realize signal quantum amplifier and light storage in the quantum information processes .",
