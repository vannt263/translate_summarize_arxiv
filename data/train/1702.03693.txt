    "processes accompanying ion collisions continue toattract considerable attention due to the advances in accelerator technology .",
    "in particular , a new facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) is being constructed based on the gsi helmholtz center for heavy ion research at darmstadt , germany  @xcite .",
    "experiments with heavy ions open wide prospects for the verification of quantum electrodynamics in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the generation of an electron - positron pair upon collisions of ions is one of the most interesting processes .",
    "this process was considered for the first time by landau and lifshitz  @xcite and was later studied in detail in the high energy range as well as for low - energy collisions ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    in the latter case",
    ", a quasi - molecule can be formed . the magnetic field produced by moving ions",
    "can reach and even exceed the critical quantum - electrodynamics value of @xmath0  g even for ion energies on the order of the coulomb barrier .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of the magnetic field is usually disregarded in accordance with the conclusions drawn in  @xcite .    however , as shown in  @xcite , the magnetic field can produce a substantial effect due to the interaction with the generated pair .",
    "the mechanism of such an interaction is analogous to magnetic field line freezing into a plasma ( this effect is well known in the plasma physics and astrophysics ) . as a result ,",
    "the lifetime of the magnetic field increases significantly and can considerably exceed the nuclear time of flight .",
    "an observable indication of this effect is the presence of resonances in the spectrum of generated pairs , which are typical of processes occurring in a magnetic field .",
    "it is interesting to note that anomalous peaks were observed in gsi experiments on collisions of heavy ions  @xcite , although the reproduction of the results unfortunately remains problematic .",
    "we believe that the main features of this effect can be investigated using the following model . the formation of a pair can be described as a photoproduction by two photons using the well - known equivalent - photon approximation .",
    "the corrections corresponding to the interaction with the magnetic field can be taken into account in the context of the furry picture ( i.e. , using the electron wavefunctions in a magnetic field ) .",
    "it should be noted that this technique is generally analogous to the bethe ",
    "maximon method used for describing collisions of ions with relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the simplest case , the problem can be reduced to two - photon generation of a pair in a magnetic field .",
    "this problem is also of independent importance in astrophysics . in particular , the effectiveness of generation of an electron",
    " positron plasma in the magnetospheres of pulsars by competing one- and two - photon processes was considered in  @xcite .    the process of generation of an electron ",
    "positron pair by two photons in a strong magnetic field was studied in  @xcite in the case of a head - on collision of photons along the magnetic field line .",
    "this process was analyzed in  @xcite in the nonresonant case , when the energy of each of the photons is insufficient for generating a pair in a one - photon process .",
    "the mean free path of a high - energy photon propagating through a photon gas along magnetic field lines was calculated in  @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we consider the effect of the resonant production of an electron ",
    "positron pair by two polarized photons in a magnetic field on the excited landau levels taking into account the spins of the particles .",
    "we calculate the resonant cross section for arbitrary polarizations of particles in the case when the electron and the positron occupy arbitrary low landau levels .",
    "we use the relativistic system of units ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "we direct the @xmath6 axis along the magnetic field and choose the vector potential in the form @xmath7 .",
    "then the electron wavefunctions describe the states with certain values of energy and momentum  @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electron mass , @xmath10 is the number of the landau level , and @xmath11 is the magnetic field strength in units of the critical field : @xmath12    the electron propagator in the given basis has the form  @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the dirac gamma matrices , @xmath17 the argument of hermite functions @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ gh ] ) has the form @xmath19 it should be noted that propagator ( [ g ] ) was also obtained independently in @xcite    figure  [ diagrams ] shows the feynman diagrams corresponding to amplitude ( [ sfi ] ) .",
    "the amplitude was obtained in explicit form in  @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of the process is determined by the law of conservation of energy and the @xmath6 component of the momentum , @xmath20 ( here and below , superscripts `` @xmath21 '' and `` @xmath22 '' correspond to the positron and electron , respectively ) .",
    "it can easily be verified  @xcite that the threshold frequencies and momenta of photons satisfy the condition @xmath23    it can be seen that this conditions can not be satisfied if both photons move parallel to the field in the same direction . in this case , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ th ] ) is zero , while the right - hand side is always greater than @xmath24 .",
    "it should be noted that the lorentz transformations along the magnetic field do not change the field itself .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we can eliminate the longitudinal momentum of the photons by appropriately choosing the reference system so that @xmath25 in addition , we consider the process in the ultra - quantum - mechanical , or low landau levels ( lll ) approximation , in which the following conditions hold : @xmath26 we introduce detuning @xmath27 from the threshold , @xmath28 where we have introduced the notation @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that the detuning is on the order of the spacing between the landau levels @xmath30 . taking into account conditions ( [ lll ] ) ,",
    "we can then write the momentum of the generated particles as @xmath31",
    "when quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 in propagator ( [ g ] ) satisfy the relativistic relation between the energy and momentum of a particle in a magnetic field , resonance takes place .",
    "the resonance condition is the equality to zero of the denominator of the green s function : @xmath34 quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined in accordance with the laws of conservation at the vertices of the diagram .",
    "equations ( [ res ] ) define two resonance conditions . we will use conditions ( [ lll ] ) and expression ( [ pzlll ] ) for the momentum of finite particles . in this case ,",
    "resonance frequencies of photons in the lowest approximation are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 for the `` @xmath21 '' and `` @xmath22 '' signs in eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that the intermediate particle is the electron in the former case and the positron in the latter case .",
    "it is well known that a second - order process in the fine - structure constant at resonance can be depicted as a sequence of first - order processes . in our case , this is the generation of a pair by a single photon and absorption of the photon in the magnetic field .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ resw1 ] ) and ( [ resw2 ] ) that one of the photons ( the hard one ) forms a pair and should have an energy exceeding the one - photon generation threshold .",
    "the second ( soft ) photon is absorbed by the electron , and its frequency should be equal to the energy of transition between landau levels ( i.e. , multiple to cyclotron frequency @xmath37 ) .",
    "the resonance conditions in the feynman exchange diagram can be obtained from expressions ( [ resw1 ] ) and ( [ resw2 ] ) by interchanging photon indices @xmath38 . in the general case",
    ", number @xmath39 also changes @xmath40 .",
    "we can obviously formulate the conditions in which resonance is possible for two diagrams simultaneously .",
    "indeed , equating the frequencies of soft photons in the direct and exchange diagrams , we obtain @xmath41    let us formulate the condition for interference of resonances in a more convenient form .",
    "we can write the energy of the soft photon in resonance as @xmath42 then , simultaneous resonance of the amplitudes is possible for values of @xmath39 and @xmath43 given by @xmath44 obviously , interference of resonances is impossible if @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , the soft photon in resonance is absorbed by different particles ( electron and positron ) in the direct and exchange diagrams . if the photon energy is higher than the energy of one of the particles , the resonance condition for the corresponding amplitude is violated .",
    "henceforth , we will mark the quantities pertaining to the soft photon with the subscript `` 1 '' .",
    "in addition , we confine our analysis to the case when resonance occurs only in one diagram . for definiteness , we set @xmath47 . in the first nonvanishing approximation in @xmath11 ,",
    "the resonance frequencies are independent of the angles of incidence of photons .",
    "calculation of the next correction in @xmath11 gives @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the polar angle of the first photon , and the sign in the first expression coincides with the sign @xmath50 .",
    "it should be noted that the hard resonant photon must be directed almost perpendicularly to the magnetic field in view of the choice of reference system ( [ k0 ] ) . using relation ( [ resw1 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath51    figure  [ t_w1 ] shows the dependences of resonance frequencies of photons , which are exact in @xmath11 .     +",
    "let us calculate the resonant cross section of the process using expressions ( [ resw1 ] ) for the resonance frequencies and assuming that conditions ( [ lll ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is well known that the differential cross section of the process has the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the intervals of final states of the electron and positron , @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the area and volume of the normalized wavefunctions for the electron and photon , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the angle between the directions of the photons . substituting the explicit form of the wavefunctions into expression ( [ sfi ] ) and retaining only the first terms in the expression in small parameter @xmath11 , we obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fine - structure constant , and indices @xmath61 denote the signs of the spin projections of the electron and position , respectively .",

    "to get rid of the divergence , we introduce width  @xmath72 of the intermediate state in accordance with the breit  wigner rule  @xcite : @xmath73    in calculating the total cross section , the integrals with respect to @xmath74 and @xmath75 can easily be evaluated using the properties of the @xmath76 function . however , expression ( [ dsigma ] ) is independent of variable @xmath77 ; therefore , the result of integration with respect to @xmath78 is factor @xmath79  @xcite . in this case , the expression for the cross section acquires the term @xmath80 in the form proposed in  @xcite : @xmath81    finally , after simple computations , the resonant cross section of the process assumes the form @xmath82 , \\ ] ] @xmath83 , \\ ] ] @xmath84 -                      2nn \\xi_1\\xi_1 s^2                      \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath85 , \\ ] ] where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 here , @xmath90 denotes the stokes parameters of the hard photon , @xmath91 are these parameters for the soft photon , and the first and second subscripts in expressions ( [ smp])([spm ] ) indicate the sign of the electron and positron spin projections , respectively .",
    "figure  [ s_h ] shows the dependences of the resonant cross section of photoproduction on the magnetic field strength for various spin projections of the particles . it can be seen from expressions ( [ smp])([spm ] ) that the cross section has the highest order of magnitude for the production of a pair with spin directions @xmath92 and @xmath93 as in the case of one - photon generation  @xcite .",
    "this spin state corresponds to the minimal energy of interaction of magnetic moments of particles with the magnetic field .",
    "the reversal of the spin projection of each particle reduces the cross section by an order of magnitude in @xmath11 .",
    "the strong dependence of the cross section on the polarization of the hard photon is also worth noting . in particular , for the normal linear polarization , we have @xmath94 , and cross section @xmath95 vanishes .",
    "it should be noted , however , that for correct comparison of cross section @xmath95 with other cross sections , it is necessary to calculate it with corrections in @xmath11 of the corresponding order of magnitude . in the case of the linear polarization of photons , expressions ( [ smp])([spm ] )",
