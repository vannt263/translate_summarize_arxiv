    "the key feature of this enumeration algorithm is that its working space is proportional to the size of the input and _ not _ to the size of the output ; it turns out to be sufficient in practice for the enumeration of simple arrangements of five double pseudolines using a relatively modest amount of process time : we establish in this paper that their number is @xmath2 .",
    "double pseudoline arrangements have been introduced recently by luc habert and the third author of the paper as a combinatorial abstraction of finite families of disjoint convex bodies of real two - dimensional projective geometries , in connection with their study of primitive operations for efficient visibility graph algorithms for planar convex shapes .",
    "more precisely they have shown that the class of isomorphism classes of double pseudoline arrangements coincides with the class of isomorphism classes of dual arrangements of finite families of pairwise disjoint convex bodies of projective geometries , and they have exploited this latter result to give an axiomatic characterization of the class of _ chirotopes _ of finite families of pairwise disjoint oriented convex bodies of projective geometries very similar to classical axiomatic characterizations of the class of chirotopes of finite families of points of projective geometries known under the generic name of ( rank three ) oriented matroids .",
    "( the _ chirotope _ of a finite family of pairwise disjoint oriented convex bodies of a projective geometry is defined as the map that assigns to each triple of convex bodies the set of relative positions of the bodies of the triple with respect to the lines of the projective geometry  the primitive operations to which we referred above consist precisely in the evaluation of the chirotope of the input configuration to the visibility graph algorithm . )",
