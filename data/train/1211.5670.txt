    "for a singular point of a complex hypersurface , the intersection of the hypersurface and the sphere centered at the point with sufficiently small radius , is called a link .",
    "milnor @xcite has constructed a theory of so - called `` milnor fibrations  , which are locally trivial fibrations over the unit circle , where the total space is the complement of the link in the sphere .",
    "this is important in singularity theory , and is used , for example , to describe the topology of complex hypersurface singularities .",
    "milnor s fibration theorem was later extended in order to describe the topology of complete intersection singularities of complex algebraic varieties by hamm @xcite .",
    "it provides rich and important examples of locally trivial fibrations like milnor fibrations . on the other hand ,",
    "it is important to investigate singular points of differentiable maps in the study of differentiable structures of manifolds .",
    "however , in general , it is difficult to construct explicit examples in which the singularities are completely determined .",
    "if we can clarify the singularities of differentiable maps constructed by using simple objects like polynomials by means of a straightforward technique , then we can expect a rich family of examples of differentiable maps for which the relations among the singular points are clear . in this paper",
    ", we define milnor fibration product maps , which generalize the milnor fibrations in a direction different from hamm s , and study their singularities in detail .",
    "a milnor fibration product map is a differentiable map into the torus @xmath0 , @xmath1 , which is constructed by @xmath2 hypersurfaces in complex @xmath3-space passing through a common point .",
    "its source is the complement to the union of the links in a small sphere , and each component function is a milnor fibration map .",
    "we study singular points of milnor fibration product maps into the tori , especially those into the @xmath4-dimensional torus .",
    "first we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a point of the source to be a singular point of the map , applying the techniques of milnor . as a corollary",
    ", we obtain examples of milnor fibration product maps which have no singular points . on the other hand ,",
    "when the polynomials defining the milnor fibration product map are a pair of weighted homogeneous polynomials whose weights are linearly dependent , we have a corollary which refines the above necessary and sufficient condition .",
    "this corollary makes it easy to determine the singular point set , since this singular point set turns out to be contained in a certain complex algebraic set determined by the weighted homogeneous polynomials , while the singular point set is a real algebraic set in general .",
    "in addition , for such a singular point obtained by using this result , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be a fold point in a practical and efficient form .",
    "fold singular point is one of the generic singular points of differentiable maps into @xmath4-dimensional manifolds . the key technique to obtain a characterization of a fold point for milnor fibration product maps , is to choose good local coordinates around the singular point of the milnor fibration product map , and to see if the singular point is a non - degenerate critical point of one of the milnor fibration maps restricted to the milnor fiber of the other fibration .",
    "furthermore , we determine the index of such a fold singular point when the normal space of the milnor fiber at the point is a complex @xmath5-dimensional vector space . using these results ,",
    "we give concrete examples for which milnor fibration product maps have only fold points as their singular points , and determine their indices completely .",
    "we also give examples of milnor fibration product maps which have singular points such that none of them are fold points . in the case where the pair of polynomials that define the milnor fibration product map is a pair of homogeneous polynomials in two variables ,",
    "we show that the singular point set is a union of circles and we also study the number of components .",
    "finally some of these results are extended to milnor fibration product maps into the tori of higher dimensions .",
