    "the origin of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) has been one of great mysteries in x - ray astronomy . at soft x - ray energies ( below 2  kev ) , the rosat surveys resolved 7080  % of the cxb into discrete sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the optical identifications are unobscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , mostly seyfert is and quasars ( @xcite ) . at higher energies , an additional population of absorbed or flat spectrum objects",
    "are needed to make up the cxb , which has a flatter spectrum in the 210  kev band than the unobscured agns .",
    "hard x - ray surveys performed with asca resolved about 30  % of the cxb in the 210  kev band , revealing the presence of a population of hard sources emerging at flux levels of several 10@xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . recently ,",
    "almost all of the hard x - ray background has been resolved into point sources by the chandra deep surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the faint sources detected with chandra have , on average , rather hard spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which indeed account for the spectrum of the cxb .",
    "however , due to the faintness of the chandra sources in the optical band , their nature still remains , in general unclear ( @xcite ) .    in order to understand this hard x - ray population over a broad range in luminosity and redshift ,",
    "it is necessary to reveal the nature of the `` bright '' sources ( i.e. , with fluxes above @xmath6  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5  in the 210  kev band ) that make up about 30  % of the cxb .",
    "in addition , because of their brightness , these sources should be much easier to study over a wide range of wavelengths than the ultra - faint chandra sources , and serve as a prototype of the key populations that comprise the cxb .",
    "the results of the optical identification of a complete hard - band selected sample in the asca large sky survey ( alss , @xcite ) indicates that the majority of the hard sources are nearby @xmath7 type-2 agns .",
    "however , in particular when sources with hard x - ray spectra are concerned , our knowledge is still quite limited due to the small sample size .",
    "thus , we have started to study the optical counterparts of the `` bright '' and `` hard '' sources selected from the asca medium sensitivity survey ( amss ; @xcite ) , a serendipitous source survey of the extragalactic sky based on the asca gis archival data at flux limits of 10@xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5  ( 210  kev ) .",
    "the advantage of the amss is its large solid angle of sky coverage , which is indispensable for obtaining a reasonable sample of `` bright '' ( hence rare ) sources .    in this paper",

    "however the large amplitude of variability confirms that these objects are indeed agns .",
    "here we summarize the results of identification for the five chandra sources .",
    "three show either weak or absent optical narrow emission lines and are at very low redshifts of @xmath0z@xmath1  @xmath2  0.06 ( axj  0223@xmath234212 , axj  0431@xmath190526 , axj  1025@xmath234714 ) , one is a narrow line object at z  =  0.460 ( axj  1510 + 0742 ) , and the other is a broad line object at z  =  0.910 ( axj  1951 + 5609 )",
    ". the optical line ratios , line widths , and the x - ray luminosity of the four narrow line objects indicate that they are consistent with their identifications as seyfert ii or liner .",
    "their x - ray spectra show strong evidence for high column densities .",
    "the hard x - ray flux ( @xmath56 ) and optical magnitudes ( @xmath57 ) of the identified objects are plotted in fig .",
    "[ opt_x1_fig ] . in the same figure",
    ", we plot hard x - ray selected agns from heao1-a2 ( triangles ) , the amss ( circles ) , the alss ( squares ) , and chandra deep field north ( asterisks and crosses , crosses means upper limit on the optical magnitude ) .",
    "note that the hellas sample ( @xcite ) falls on a similar range to the whole amss sample ( see @xcite ) . as seen from the figure",
    ", there is a wide variety of the @xmath58 ratio in our sample : axj  1510 + 0742 and axj  1951 + 5609 have hard x - ray to optical flux ratio close to that of the optically - faint x - ray sources seen by chandra and xmm ( @xmath59 ) , while the three low redshift sources show a much smaller ratio ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we defer to a later paper a detailed discussion of the origin of the wide range in the x - ray to optical flux ratios .",
    "[ z_pi_fig ] the redshift versus apparent photon index plot of our sample together with the alss sample , a flux limited complete sample at similar flux levels ( @xcite ) .",
    "as seen in this figure , three sources in our chandra sample are even harder than the hardest x - ray source in the alss ( axj  131501 + 314 ) in terms of the best - fit photon index . for comparison ,",
    "table  [ lss_tab ] summarizes the optical and x - ray properties of the five `` hardest '' sources in the above alss sample .",
    "these alss hard sources are all located at low redshifts of @xmath61 and are identified as four narrow line agns and one broad line agn ( axj  130926 + 2952 ) .",
    "equivalent widths of a narrow emission line of h@xmath62 and [ oiii]@xmath63 are also given in table  [ lss_tab ] ( for line ratios see table  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "except for axj  130926 + 2952 , which shows a strong [ oiii]@xmath63 line , their equivalent widths are similar to those of the three nearby sources in our chandra sample .",
    "similar to the chandra sample ( see next section ) most of the alss hard sources have the morphology of elliptical or early type spiral galaxies and no clear nucleus is visible in the optical images .      in this subsection , we discuss the nature of the three nearby sources in our amss - chandra sample ( axj  0223@xmath234212 , axj  0431@xmath190526 , and axj  1025@xmath234714 ) , which are identified as seyfert iis or a liners . as we describe below , in many respects these sources are apparently `` normal '' galaxies , and could be considered to represent the major population of very hard sources at fluxes of @xmath6 erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5  ( 210 kev ) .",
    "they are all in the nearby universe with an average redshift of 0.06 and have a very low hard x - ray to optical flux ratio ( @xmath64 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ opt_image_fig ] , these objects are clearly resolved and show no signs of a luminous nucleus .",
    "interestingly , as opposed to virtually all optically selected seyfert iis , 80% of which are sa or later in the sample of @xcite and @xcite , the host galaxies of axj  0431@xmath190526 and axj",
    "1025@xmath234714 have the morphology of e or s0 .",
    "this may be related to the fact that these x - ray selected sources have larger luminosities compared with the optically selected seyfert iis .",
    "they all have similar @xmath65 colors , consistent with that of old elliptical galaxies at z  @xmath2  0.05 ( @xmath66 ) , and bluer than optically - selected qsos at z  @xmath67  0.2 ( @xmath68 ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the existence of nad and mgb absorption lines in the optical continuum spectra of the objects suggests that their continuum in the optical wavelength is dominated by emission from host galaxy . the x - ray to @xmath69band flux ratio and the x - ray to optical flux ratio of these objects are smaller than normal qsos .",
    "even if the nuclei of axj  0223@xmath234212 , axj  0431@xmath190526 , and axj  1025@xmath234714 are not affected by optical extinction ( have similar @xmath58 or @xmath70 ratio to normal qsos ) , the host galaxy components of these objects are brighter than the expected optical flux from the nucleus and may explain the relative weakness of the optical emission lines and the absence of a blue continuum by dilution of the nuclear component in the beam by starlight .",
    "the optical line widths and equivalent widths themselves do not distinguish these objects from normal ( i.e. , non - agn ) galaxies .",
    "the upper limits of @xmath2  500  km  s@xmath5 on the line widths are consistent with the distribution of line widths in seyfert  ii galaxies ( figure  4 of @xcite ) which has a average value of 600  km  s@xmath5 with a 250  km  s@xmath5 variance ( see also @xcite who shows that oiii is a bit narrower with a median value of 325  km  s@xmath5 with a variance of 200  km  s@xmath5 ) and thus is not definitive in the classification of the objects . the low equivalent width of the lines and the fact that their intensity is similar to that found in a field galaxy sample ( @xcite , @xcite ) again does not distinguish these objects .",
    "similarly the luminosity of the lines is consistent with that seen in field galaxy samples . on the other hand ,",
    "as we have shown above , the line ratios of two objects lie in the ionization range seen for many seyfert  iis and thus are indicative of agn , and one has line ratios indicative of liner activity .",
    "such objects have been already detected in optical spectroscopic surveys of field galaxies : @xcite find @xmath2  15  % of all field galaxies have `` agn - like '' emission line ratios .",
    "the colors of the three nearby objects are completely consistent with that of stars with no sign of a non - thermal continuum .",
    "however , these galaxies are optically luminous with mv  @xmath2  @xmath19(2122 ) and the relatively low luminosity active nuclei in these objects may be hidden by the glare of the starlight despite the low redshifts . using the @xcite spectral energy distribution",
    "one predicts that the effective optical magnitude of the active nucleus would be @xmath2  1719  mag assuming that the nucleus is not absorbed and thus rather difficult to detect from ground based observations .",
    "the fact that these rather bright nearby galaxies harbor `` optically invisible '' agn shows the incompleteness of optical active galaxy searches .",
    "since the colors of these objects also show no abnormalities they would be missed by color selected surveys like the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "it is also possible that the nuclei are absorbed in the optical and uv bands by the same matter that absorbs the x - ray continuum , reducing the observed optical flux .",
    "the effective reddening corresponding to the x - ray column densities of ( 0.515 )  @xmath25  10@xmath71  @xmath4 is av  @xmath2   270 mags thus effectively eliminating the optical - uv flux .",
    "our results indicate that `` very hard '' x - ray sources at fluxes of @xmath72  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5  ( 210  kev ) are mostly nearby @xmath73 sources with a column density of @xmath74  @xmath4 , rather than high redshift ( hence high luminosity ) objects with a higher column density of @xmath75  @xmath4 .",
    "this fully supports the result of the alss and is a strong constraint on the unified models of the x - ray background .",
    "according to the calculation of @xcite and @xcite , about half of sources with a column density @xmath1  10@xmath71  @xmath4 should have redshifts greater than 1 at a flux of @xmath76  10@xmath3  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 .",
    "we have to remember , however , that there could be bias against high redshift objects having moderate column densities in our chandra sample because our selection criteria were based on the `` apparent '' hardness : due to k - correction absorbed sources at higher redshifts show softer spectra in the observer frame .",
    "precise measurement of the column densities of slightly less hard sources detected in the alss and amss ( @xcite ) is important for a definitive test of the unified model .",
    "the optical counterparts of the hard , faint asca sources discussed in this paper have rather different properties from those of soft x - ray and optically selected agn in the sense that they have earlier morphological types , do not possess a luminous optical or ir nucleus , have near - infrared colors similar to that of normal galaxies , and show only weak narrow emission lines .",
    "these unusual properties have already seen in the alss hard sample ( table  [ lss_tab ] ) and in the hellas survey at a similar x - ray flux level ( @xcite ) as well as in the deeper chandra fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we present the results of the first third of our chandra follow - up of faint hard x - ray selected asca sources .",
    "we have optical counterparts for five of the seven objects , since two of them were too faint to uniquely associate the chandra with the asca source .",
    "of these five optical counterparts three of them show either weak or absent optical lines of low physical and equivalent width and are at low redshift @xmath0z@xmath1  @xmath2  0.06 .",
    "one of them is a z  =  0.460 object with only narrow lines and one is a broad line object at z  =  0.910 .",
    "all the narrow line objects show strong evidence for absorption in their x - ray spectra , and their line ratios are consistent with a seyfert ii / liner identification as are the line widths .",
    "the three nearby objects have the colors of normal galaxies and apparently the light is dominated by stars .",
    "this could be due to the extinction of the underlying nuclear continuum by the same matter that absorbs the x - rays and/or due to the dilution of the central source by starlight .",
    "these results suggest that x - ray sources that appear as `` normal '' galaxies in optical and near - ir bands with weak ( but agn - like ) narrow emission lines significantly contribute to the hard x - ray background , supporting the previous results of the alss and the hellas .",
