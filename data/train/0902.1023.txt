    "liners ( low ionization nuclear emission - line region ) are frequently identified in the local universe : different surveys show that up to 1/3 of all galaxies show liner - like spectra ( see ho 2008 for a recent review ) . comparing with seyfert 2",
    "galaxies and star - forming galaxies , optical spectra of liners are dominated by the emission lines of low - ionized species , such as [ ] @xmath2 , [ ] @xmath3 , [ ] @xmath4 and [ ] @xmath5 ( e.g. , heckman 1980 )    emission - line ratios are frequently used to classify different emission - line galaxies with distinct power sources . at present , the classification of emission - line galaxies is commonly based on the empirical bpt diagrams that were originally proposed by baldwin et al . ( 1981 ) , and then refined by veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) .",
    "theoretical and empirical demarcation lines were proposed by kewley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to separate star - forming galaxies on the bpt diagrams , respectively .",
    "kewley et al .",
    "( 2006 ) recently proposed a new empirical classification scheme that separates seyferts and liners .",
    "however , liners are diverse in their observational properties .",
    "ho et al . (",
    "1993 ) identified a group of liner/ `` transition objects '' with relatively low [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios compared with `` pure '' liners .",
    "they proposed that the liner/ objects are most likely composite systems that contain a liner plus an region .",
    "many studies found that these `` transition '' liners differ from the `` pure '' ones in their stellar population distributions ( e.g. , cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 ; kewley et al .",
    "wang & wei ( 2008 ) and xiao et al .",
    "( in preparation ) show that all their broad - line liners are associated with large [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios and old stellar populations .",
    "liners have been under hot debate in origin for a long time .",
    "the photoionization by the central agns is suggested to be a main power source in some liners ( e.g. , ferland & netzer 1983 ) . the agn origin is strongly supported by the detection of broad emission lines in optical spectra ( e.g. , ho et al .",
    "1997 ; wang & wei 2008 ) .",
    "other evidence supporting the agn origin includes the hard x - ray spectra ( e.g. , terashima et al . 2000 ; flohic et al .",
    "2006 ) , and uv variability ( e.g. , maoz et al . 2005 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "liners could be explained by other excitation mechanisms unrelated to an agn , such as fast shocks ( e.g. , dopita et al .",
    "1997 ; lipari et al .",
    "2004 ) , post - agb stars ( binette et al . 1994 ) , or low mass x - ray binaries ( e.g. , eracleous et al .",
    "2002 ; flohic et al .",
    "2006 ) .    at present",
    ", these results imply that the current classification scheme results in a hybrid liner population ( different power sources or evolution stages ) . in this letter , we study the classification scheme through several different approaches , and show that the currently classified liners consist of two populations that can be clearly separated on the bpt diagrams .",
    "the distinct two populations might have different physical origins , and be at different evolutionary stages .",
    "wang & wei ( 2008 ) and xiao et al .",
    "( in preparation ) ) located above the kauffmann demarcation line according to measurements given in the mpa / jhu catalog by the same method described in wang & wei ( 2008 ) . ] systematically searched for partially obscured agns from the mpa / jhu sdss dr4 catalog ( heckman & kauffmann 2006 and references therein ) according to the existence of broad h@xmath0 emission in the spectra , where @xmath6 is the stellar continuum subtracted flux averaged over the rest frame wavelength range from 6500 to 6530 , and @xmath7 is the standard deviation of flux within wavelength region between 5980 and 6020 . ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the distributions of these partially obscured agns on the three commonly used bpt diagrams .",
    "the objects from wang & wei ( 2008 ) and from xiao et al . are displayed by the red solid and open squares , respectively .",
    "indeed , the detection of broad h@xmath0 emission is strongly affected by the contamination of diffuse light from the old stars .",
    "a large effect is expected in the sdss spectra , especially for weak nuclear emission , since the spectra are obtained by a relatively large fiber aperture ( 3 ) .",
    "the nearby broad - line liners identified in the palomar spectroscopic surveys ( ho et al .",
    "1997 ) are therefore included to avoid the bias .",
    "these objects are shown in figure 1 by the blue circles .",
    "based on the combined sample , although it is not clear in the [ ] /h@xmath1 vs. [ ] /h@xmath0 diagram , a remarkable zone of avoidance ( zoa ) is obviously found in the other two diagrams , especially in the [ ] /h@xmath1 vs. [ ] /h@xmath0 diagram , for the broad - line liners .",
    "the non - detection of broad h@xmath0 in the objects within the zoa can not be caused by the increasing contribution of young stars , both because young stars show less contamination caused by the stellar absorptions at the h@xmath0 region and because seyfert galaxies have stellar population ages younger than liners ( see figure 11 in kewley et al .",
    "we examined the high quality spectra of lirgs ( cao et al .",
    "2006 ) located in the zoa one by one by eyes , and the results reinforce the non - detection of broad h@xmath0 .",
    "the zoa naturally suggests that the previously defined liners likely consist of at least two types of galaxies with distinct power sources . in each panel",
    ", we define an empirical lower boundary for these broad - line liners by eye , and plot the boundary by a short - dashed line .",
    "the regions above and below the line is defined as zone a and b for short , respectively .",
    "the lack of broad - line liners naturally motivates us to suspect that the liners in the zone b are powered by the ionizing radiation arising from some stellar processes unrelated to an agn .",
    "the host properties are investigated in two aspects in this section : infrared emission and occurrence of core - collapse supernovae ( cc - sne ) .",
    "cao et al . ( 2006 ) established a large sample of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , defined as @xmath8 ) through the cross - identification of the sdss dr2 with the catalogs of the _ iras survey .",
    "figure 2 shows the distributions of the sample on the three bpt diagrams .",
    "the lirgs are shown by the cyan solid and open triangles for the _ iras faint and point sources , respectively . as an additional test , the ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath9 ) identified in the _ iras 1jy sample ( kim & sanders 1998 ; veilleux et al .",
    "1999 ) are overplotted in figure 2 by the blue stars . _",
    "_ _    similar as done in sect .",
    "2 , we focus on the [ ] /h@xmath1 vs. [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath1 vs. [ ] /h@xmath0 diagrams . the diagrams clearly show that all the infrared luminous liners are remarkably clustered in the zone b defined previously , except only a few outliers .",
    "the occurrence of cc - sne is an indicative of young and intermediate - aged stellar populations .",
    "the cc - sne are believed to be produced by the explosion of massive stars ( @xmath10 ) at the end of their life time ( @xmath11yr ) .",
    "we cross - match the sdss dr6 with the sai - sdss image sn catalog originally done by prieto et al .",
    "the sample finally contains the sdss spectra of host galaxies ( central 3 ) of 51 type ib / c and 182 type ii sne . we remove the absorption features from the spectra through the pca technique as described in wang & wei ( 2008 ) .",
    "the emission line fluxes are then measured by the direct integration on the starlight - subtracted spectra .",
    "the distributions of these galaxies on the three bpt diagrams are plotted in figure 2 . as same as the results given before ,",
    "the liners selected by the occurrence of cc - sne are mainly located in the zone b.",
    "the above statistical study indicates that the currently classified liners could be obviously separated into two categories on the traditional bpt diagrams .",
    "the separation is most remarkable in the [ ] /h@xmath0 vs. [ ] /h@xmath1 diagram : a ) population i liners within the zone a have large [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios ; b ) population ii liners within the zone b have low [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "the two populations show distinct observational properties that are compared with each other in table 1 .",
    "in addition to the observational properties described above , the two populations are also different in their host stellar population ages .",
    "the stellar population is found to be on average younger in population ii liners than in population i liners ( e.g. , kewley et al .",
    "2006 ; wang & wei 2008 ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 ; gonzalez delgado et al . 2004",
    "; sarzi et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the distinct observational properties imply that the two population liners have different excitation mechanisms . for the population i liners",
    ", one naturally expects that the gas is photoionized by the ionizing radiation arising from the central accretion disk due to the detection of the broad lines in their spectra .",
    "not as luminous agns , a weak ionizing radiation ( @xmath12 ) with a hard spectrum is required to explain the emission - line spectra of liners ( e.g. , kewley et al .",
    "2006 ; lewis et al . 2003 ; sabra et al . 2003 ; gabel et al .",
    "indeed , the hard x - ray spectra are observed in some liners by different instruments ( e.g. , flochi et al .",
    "2006 ; gliozzi et al .",
    "2008 ; rinn et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the low level and hard ionizing radiation is consistent with the predictions of the advection dominated accretion model ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; narayan et al .",
    "1995 ) in which the inefficient radiation results in a hot accretion disk . finally , the non - detection of luminous infrared emission and cc - sne in the objects could be interpreted by both weak accretion activity and aged stellar population .",
    "the explanation of the excitation mechanism is , however , non - trivial for the population ii liners .",
    "the non - detection of broad lines in their spectra implies that they are plausibly related to the stellar processes ( see also in ho 2008 ) .",
    "comparisons of x - ray and optical observations show an anomalous high h@xmath0 emission for the `` transition '' liners ( e.g. , ho 2008 ; terashima & wilson 2003 ; flochi et al .",
    "the fast shock model could be excluded at first because the observed uv high excitation emission lines are always lower than the predicted ones ( e.g. , gabel et al . 2000 ; maoz et al .",
    "1998 ) . the young star cluster model (",
    "barth & shields 2000 ) requires extremely young stellar populations and sizable wolf - rayet stars that are , however , not observed ( e.g. , ho et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the `` transition '' liners are suspected to be composite systems that consist of a liner and an region component , which , however , can not explain the non - detection of broad emission line in the population ii liners .",
    "the liner - like spectra can be ionized by evolved , low massive stars .",
    "the spectral synthesis model shows that the ionizing photon is dominated by the emission from the post - agbs after @xmath13yr since the burst ( binette et al . 1994 ) .",
    "a simple calculation recently done by ho ( 2008 ) suggests that the post - agb stars within the center of galaxies can provide sufficient ionizing photons in the `` transition '' liners .",
    "in particular , the post - agb star models predict a low [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio ( @xmath14 ) for reasonable parameters ( binette et al . 1994 ; stasinska et al . 2008 ) , which is quantitatively in agreement with the current boundary separating the population i and ii liners . the post - agb star model is also consistent with the observed infrared properties .",
    "one of the characteristic features of post - agb stars are their strong infrared excess .",
    "we estimate the infrared luminosity for individual post - agb star as @xmath15 in two fiducial cases : @xmath16pc , @xmath17k and @xmath18pc , @xmath19k ( suarez et al .",
    "2006 ) , where @xmath20 is the distance from the dust shell to star , @xmath21 is the temperature of the dust and @xmath22 is the emissivity of the dust ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "the total infrared luminosity from the dust is then @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the integrated post - agb star mass and mass of individual post - agb star ( i.e. , @xmath26 ) . adopting the typical integrated stellar mass of galaxy center @xmath27 and the salpeter imf results in a roughly estimated integrated infrared luminosity @xmath28 , which is ( marginally ) in agreement with the definition of lirgs ( ulirgs ) .",
    "note that the estimated infrared luminosity should be strictly regarded as an upper limit because the exact value strongly depends on star formation history of galaxy .",
    "finally , the occurrence of cc - sne in the population ii liners provides evidence in timescale supporting the post - agb star model . as massive stars explode at the end of their lifetimes @xmath11yr",
    ", the low- and intermediate - mass stars ( 1 - 8@xmath29 ) evolve to the agb and post - agb phase at the end of their main sequence lifetimes with an upper limit @xmath30yr .",
    "we briefly discuss the implications on the agn s evolutionary scenario in the context of the coevolution of agn and its host galaxy .",
    "some recent studies suggest a delay ( with time scale @xmath31myr ) between the onset of the star formation and the subsequent intensive black hole accretion ( e.g. , davis et al . 2007 ;",
    "kawakatu et al .",
    "2003 ; granato et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the emission lines might be dominantly excited by the massive starburst at the very beginning of an agn activity .",
    "the central accretion nucleus is either obscured ( e.g. hopkins et al . 2005 , wada & norman 2002 ) or too weak to maintain a blr ( e.g. , laor 2003 ; xu & cao 2007 ; nicastro et al .",
    "2003 ; elitzur & shlosman 2006 ) . the accretion activity might increase within the first a few of @xmath32yr as the very young circumnuclear stellar population ages ( davis et al . 2007 ) .",
    "after the first a few of @xmath32yr , when the agn is still buried or weak , the emission lines are dominantly excited by the ionizing radiation from post - agb stars ( i.e. , the population i liner phase ) .",
    "sturm et al . ( 2006 ) indicated that ir - bright liners have intermediate pah feature ratios ( 12.7@xmath33m/11.2@xmath33 m and 6.2@xmath33m/11.2@xmath33 m ) between region and ir - faint liners . at this phase ,",
    "the post - agb stars contribute the luminous infrared emission , and the evolved massive stars explode at the end of their lives .",
    "a luminous agn subsequently appears , and shines with decreasing eddington ratio as the stellar population continuously ages ( wang & wei 2008 ; kewley et al .",
    "after the luminous phase , the agn evolves to a less luminous stage with hard ionizing radiation ( i.e. , population i liner phase ) .",
    "the underlying very old stellar population becomes dominant because the importance of the young stellar population fades out entirely .",
    "the previously defined liners are found to consist of two categories that can be clearly separated in the traditional bpt diagrams , especially in the [ ] /h@xmath0 vs. [ ] /h@xmath1 diagram .",
    "population i liners are defined to have higher [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios than population ii liners .",
    "the two population liners differs in the presence of broad emission lines in their spectra , strength of infrared emission , host galaxy stellar population age , and occurrence of cc - sne .",
    "these different properties suggest that the two populations not only have different line excitation mechanisms , but also are at different evolution stages .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for valuable comments and suggestions that help to improve the paper .",
