    "the lorentz and , in certain cases , cpt symmetries breaking is now treated as an important ingredient of the possible extension of the standard model @xcite .",
    "typically , the lorentz symmetry is broken through some additive terms that are proportional to small constant vectors or tensors ( coefficients ) introducing privileged directions in the space - time .",
    "their potential applications range from quantum field theory to condensed matter physics , as occurs , for example , with the well - known carroll - field - jackiw ( cfj ) term @xcite ( see @xcite for its applications to study of weyl semi - metals ) .",
    "this term represents a four - dimensional extension of the chern - simons ( cs ) term , which has gained considerable attention in three dimensions ( 3d ) because of its relation with planar phenomena , such as the fractional quantum hall effect and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the cfj term is a topological term violating the lorentz and cpt symmetries , while the gauge symmetry is preserved .",
    "it is responsible to provide a topological mass for the gauge field , thus changing the dispersion relation of the photon in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the cfj term can be generated dynamically through the functional integration over the dirac fermion fields in a classical action involving a coupling of fermions to the gauge field and to a constant axial vector @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can speak about the effective lorentz - breaking dynamics of the gauge field in four dimensions",
    ".    an important feature of the cfj term consists in its ambiguity @xcite . from the formal viewpoint this ambiguity",
    "is related to the fact that the contribution to the cfj term is superficially divergent , however , its pole parts are mutually canceled , so that we have a some kind of the removable @xmath3 singularity . some values for the cfj term",
    "are presented in @xcite , which differ by the regularization methods used to remove the singularity , while the topological structure of this term continues to be the same in all cases .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the behavior of the coefficient of the induced cfj term , when the physical system is placed in contact with a thermal bath @xcite , in order to study its nonanalyticity .",
    "it is known that in the regime of finite temperature , the self - energy is , in many cases , a nonanalytic function of the external momenta @xmath4 , in the limit @xmath5 . due to using of a specific frame of the thermal bath , the self - energy , in general , depends on @xmath6 and @xmath7 in different manners , so that the static limit @xmath1 and the long wavelength limit @xmath8 in these cases do not commute , as it was demonstrated in the cases of self - interacting scalars @xcite , maxwell - chern - simons - higgs model @xcite , 3d qed @xcite and hot qcd @xcite .",
    "as the ultraviolet behavior of the theory ( and hence , the structure of the possible divergences ) is temperature independent , we expect that regularization ambiguities do not modify the temperature dependence of the cfj term .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ se ] , we single out the contribution linear in the coefficient @xmath9 , from the self - energy tensor , using a perturbative method and dimensional regularization . in sec .  [ cs ] , we perform the computation at finite temperature , in imaginary time formalism , carrying out the sum over the matsubara frequencies before the calculation of the spatial momentum integrals .",
    "this calculation was never considered before , and it allows us to extract the non - covariant tensorial structure of the cfj term , linear in the external momentum , and verify the nonanalyticity of its coefficient when we take into account the two limits @xmath1 and @xmath8 . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we discuss our results and perspectives .",
    "in this section we are interested in studying the radiative generation of the cpt - odd lorentz - violating chern - simons term from the coupling of the gauge field to massive fermions , at finite temperature . for this ,",
    "let us consider the fermionic sector of the lorentz - violating qed , given by @xmath10 thus , the corresponding generating functional can be written as @xmath11 = \\int da_{\\mu}d\\bar\\psi d\\psi\\ e^{i\\int d^4x{\\cal l}_\\psi } = \\int da_{\\mu}\\ e^{is_\\mathrm{eff}},\\ ] ] where the one - loop effective action , obtained by integrating over the fermions , takes the form @xmath12 here , @xmath13 stands for the trace over the dirac matrices , as well as the trace over the space coordinate .",
    "now , in order to single out the quadratic terms in @xmath14 of the effective action , we rewrite the expression ( [ seff ] ) as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 then , after the evaluation of the trace over the coordinate space , by using relation @xmath18 , which is the basic one within the derivative expansion method @xcite , and the completeness relation of the momentum space , the quadratic action @xmath19 is rewritten as @xmath20 in the above expression @xmath21 is the vacuum polarization tensor , that is , in our case , the one - loop photon self - energy tensor of the form @xmath22 where the fermion propagator depends on the lorentz - violating axial vector @xmath9 and is given by @xmath23    in order to work out the one loop photon self - energy  ( [ pi ] ) , in the perturbative approach , we must expand the propagator  ( [ g ] ) up to the first order in @xmath24 , as follows @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we expand the vacuum polarization as a power series in @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , with    @xmath30    in these expressions @xmath31 and @xmath0 is the external momentum . note that immediately we can see that @xmath32 , by considering the shift @xmath33 .",
    "let us calculate @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in the dimensional regularization scheme , moving the matrix @xmath36 to the end of the expression , so that , after rationalizing the propagator and calculating the trace , we get    [ pib1221 ] @xmath37,\\\\ \\label{tr2 } \\pi_{b21|odd}^{\\mu\\nu}(k ) & = & 4e^2\\mu^{4-d}\\int\\frac{d^d p}{(2\\pi)^d}\\frac{1}{(p^2-m^2 ) ( p_1 ^ 2-m^2)^2}\\left[(p_1 ^ 2-m^2)\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\kappa\\lambda } b_\\kappa ( -p_{\\lambda}+2k_\\lambda)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.+2(p_1^\\mu \\epsilon^{\\nu\\kappa\\lambda\\rho }",

    ". however , these divergent terms do not contribute to the final result @xmath40 , because they cancel each other already in the integrand .",
    "thus , the remaining divergences are at most logarithmic and the gauge invariance is restored .    nevertheless , the relation @xmath32 is spoiled after the cancellation of these linear divergent terms . however , by considering , f.e . ,",
    "@xmath41 in @xmath34 , we can rewrite the expressions ( [ pib1221 ] ) , so that we now have @xmath42 , where @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 . therefore , we need to calculate only @xmath45 since these tensors contribute equally to the result @xmath40 .",
    "we note that this expression has a structure rather typical to the integrands arising within the calculation of the cfj term , see , f.e . , @xcite . also , it is clear that under the replacement @xmath46 , either for @xmath47 or for @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , the logarithmic divergence disappears , and the integral turns out finite but different for these two choices of @xmath50 just as occurs , f.e .",
    ", in @xcite .",
    "so , the result is finite and ambiguous giving @xmath51 , with @xmath52 is a regularization - dependent number yielding 1 for @xmath47 and 0 for @xmath48 .",
    "the next step in the computation at finite temperature is the introduction of the matsubara frequencies , followed by extraction of the non - covariant tensorial structure , which we perform in the next section , and , as we will see , the result will display the nonanalyticity .",
    "let us now generalize our results to the finite temperature . to implement the finite temperature effects , we carry out the wick rotation and split the internal momentum @xmath53 into its spatial and temporal components .",
    "for this , we must perform the following replacements : @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and so on , as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 , in order to separate our integration variables , with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , being a time - like vector , and @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , let us assume from now on the system to be in thermal equilibrium with a temperature @xmath63 , so that the antiperiodic ( periodic ) boundary conditions for fermions ( bosons ) lead to discrete values of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , where @xmath66 ( respectively @xmath67 ) is an integer .",
    "thus , the replacement of integration over @xmath68 by the sum over @xmath66 in ( [ egi ] ) , by the rule @xmath69 , gives us @xmath70 in the following , using the decomposition @xmath71 , in order to extract the tensorial structure independent of internal momentum , we arrive at @xmath72,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where    [ c ] @xmath73    by analyzing eq .",
    "( [ piin ] ) , we see that it involves the covariant cfj term proportional to @xmath74 presenting as well at zero temperature and non - covariant cfj - like structures arising only at finite temperature .",
    "now , let us first perform the sums and take the static @xmath1 and long - wave @xmath8 limits with respect to external momenta , in each one of the equations ( [ c ] ) , and then finally we evaluate the spatial integrals .",

    "( [ c4 ] ) , the integrand in the coefficient @xmath83 is odd with respect to the external momentum @xmath84 .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the expressions ( [ sl ] ) , in the static limit , look like the sum of the expressions ( [ lw ] ) , in the long wavelength limit , and some additive term exponentially suppressed for small temperatures , that is , at @xmath92 , but increasing as the temperature grows .",
    "let us now rewrite the eq .",
