    "<S> the nuclear stopping , the elliptic flow , and the hbt interferometry are calculated by the urqmd transport model , in which potentials for  pre - formed \" particles ( string fragments ) from color fluxtube fragmentation as well as for confined particles are considered . </S>",
    "<S> this description provides stronger pressure at the early stage and describes these observables better than the default cascade mode ( where the  pre - formed \" particles from string fragmentation are treated to be free - streaming ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the inclusion of potential interactions pushes down the calculated hbt radius @xmath0 and pulls up the @xmath1 so that the hbt time - related puzzle disappears throughout the energies from ags , sps , to rhic .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most important discoveries from sps and rhic experiments in the beginning of this century is that a new form of matter is produced in high energy ion collisions that seems to behave as a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at rhic energies , the sqgp seems to be a nearly  perfect liquid \" with small viscosity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although hydrodynamical studies are a useful tool for the theoretical investigations at rhic energies , hydrodynamics fails at lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a relativistic dynamic transport approach , in which an entire equilibrium is not pre - assumed , is necessary to explore the excitation functions of various observables . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transport model has the advantage of observing the whole phase - space evolution of all particles involved in a microscopic fashion .    in order to detect this new matter - quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) - many theoretical suggested observables </S>",
    "<S> have been discussed and argued frequently . among these , </S>",
    "<S> the hanbury - brown - twiss interferometry ( hbt ) or femtoscopy technique has been used widely to extract the spatio - temporal information of the particle freeze - out source . </S>",
    "<S> it would be a vital discovery if there is an nontrivial transition in the spatio - temporal characteristics of the source , when going from low to high beam energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the hbt parameters have been scanned thoroughly over the energies from sis , ags , sps , up to rhic , unfortunately , no obvious discontinuities do appear @xcite .    however , this  null \" result does not mean that the hbt technique comes to an end . non - gaussian effects might shadow the possible energy dependence of the hbt parameters (  _ e - puzzle _ \" ) , and this topic has been quickly improving in the recent years @xcite . secondly , </S>",
    "<S> even with a gaussian parametrization , we found that the hbt time - related puzzle (  _ t - puzzle _ \" ) is present at almost all energies from ags to rhic @xcite . in order to understand the origins of these  puzzles \" , it is necessary to dig deeper into the dynamics of the heavy ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic model , in which various kinds of equations of state ( eos ) with latent heats are considered , successfully explained the elliptic flow @xmath2 at transverse momentum @xmath3gev@xmath4 at rhic energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , hydrodynamics failed to explain the experimental @xmath5 data ( @xcite and the references therein ) , i.e. the ratio between the hbt radii in outward and sideward directions , where the  t - puzzle \" initially occurred . but </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been realized that a direct ( fully  apple - to - apple \" ) comparison between hydro calculations and data is required @xcite .    in the transport models , </S>",
    "<S> the effective eos is softened by the existence of resonances , but the re - scattering between particles will reinforce to some extent the stiffness of the dense matter . at sps and rhic energies , </S>",
    "<S> the color - string excitation and fragmentation is further considered for particle production and subsequent evolution in the ultra - relativistic / relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd / rqmd ) hadron - string transport models . </S>",
    "<S> the formation time of the hadrons from string fragmentation is determined by a </S>",
    "<S>  yo - yo \" mode @xcite . during the formation time , the  pre - formed \" particles ( string fragments that will be projected onto hadron states later on ) are usually treated to be free - streaming , while reduced cross sections are only included for leading hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of  pre - formed \" hadrons is a well - known concept in the description of deep inelastic scattering data ( dis ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been found that the  pre - formed \" hadrons from the color fluxtube fragmentation behave already very hadronlike , before the hadron formation is fully completed @xcite . in previous calculations </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the interaction of the newly created  </S>",
    "<S> pre - formed \" particles from the string fragmentation is usually not taken into account for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the facts have shown that the effective eos at the early stage in the past model simulations is too soft and the early pressure is inadequate to match the calculated elliptic flow to the experimentally observed flows at rhic energies @xcite . in order to make up for this discrepancy in the early - stage eos , </S>",
    "<S> it is essential to modify the dynamics of the early stage with / without new degrees of freedom , such as done in a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) @xcite , the hadronic rescattering ( hrm ) @xcite , the quark molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite , and the parton hadron string dynamics ( phsd ) @xcite model .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the new matter which is dominant at the early stage , the potentials between confined hadrons which play a role during almost all time of the collision process deserve attention as well . in the previously low energy urqmd calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath6 served for the eos consists of the kinetic energy @xmath7 and the effective two - body interaction potential energy @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential energy @xmath8 is indispensable , which includes the two - body and three - body ( which can be approximately written in the form of two - body interaction ) skyrme- ( also called as the density dependent terms ) , yukawa- , and coulomb - terms @xcite . recently , in order to be more successfully applied in the intermediate energy region ( @xmath9a gev ) , more terms are considered @xcite , those are , the density - dependent symmetry potential ( essential for isospin - asymmetric reactions at intermediate and low energies ) and the momentum - dependent term . at higher energies , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , ags / fair and sps , the yukawa- and symmetry- potentials of baryons becomes negligible , while the skyrme- and the momentum - dependent part of potentials still influence the whole dynamic process of hics though weakly . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the effects of the mean field with momentum dependence on collective flows from hics at 2 - 158a gev energies were studied by a jet aa microscopic transportation model ( jam ) and it has been found that the momentum dependence in the nuclear mean field is important for the understanding of the proton collective flows at ags and even at sps energies . </S>",
    "<S> further , by adopting the same soft eos with momentum dependence ( sm - eos ) on confined baryons , we also found that the calculated @xmath5 ratio from hics at ags energies can be vastly improved when compared to the measured data @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we will follow this idea and investigate the hbt radii at higher beam energies , i.e. sps and rhic . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the other observables , such as the rapidity distributions of net protons ( @xmath10 ) and pions , and the elliptic flows of charged hadrons , are checked at the same time . as an initial attempt </S>",
    "<S> , we consider potentials for both formed and  pre - formed \" particles : 1 ) , for formed baryons , the sm - eos @xcite is chosen . the coulomb potential is also considered , as in the low - energy calculations @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , 5 ) , there is no potential interaction between  pre - formed \" baryons and formed baryons so far . </S>",

    "<S> however , when the density - dependent eos for  pre - formed \" particles is additionally taken into account , one observes that two bumps in the rapidity distribution of net protons appear . </S>",

    "<S> it is known that , below ags energies hadrons are dominantly produced from the decay of resonances so that the considered potentials for  pre - formed \" particles from string fragmentations have no effect on the hbt radii @xcite . at higher energies </S>",
    "<S>  pre - formed \" particles play a dominant role for the early stage dynamics , which can be seen , e.g. , by the comparison of solid lines and the lines with triangles at @xmath51 gev . so far </S>",
    "<S> the question of a steeper @xmath37-dependence of hbt radii than data at high sps and rhic energies , similar to the ampt transport model calculations with parton scatterings @xcite , is still open .    </S>",

    "<S> , the ratio nearly approaches the value obtained in the cascade mode . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the potential of confined hadrons is increasingly losing its importance with increasing beam energy . at sps and rhic </S>",
