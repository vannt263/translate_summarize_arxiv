    "the characterisation of the folding pathway of proteins is one of the fundamental problems in molecular biology and is under an increasing scientific attention due to the continuous advancements in experimental and theoretical biochemistry . after the work of anfinsen@xcite , who demonstrated that ribonuclease unfolds and refolds reversibly into its native ( active ) three - dimensional structure",
    ", it has generally been accepted that the primary sequence usually contains sufficient information to direct the complete folding process .",
    "what typically remains elusive to experimental and theoretical investigations is the pathway of this spontaneous process and the mechanisms that govern it .",
    "a considerable progress in this direction is possible for proteins containing native disulfide bonds .",
    "the formation of disulfide bonds during the folding process can be controlled experimentally through the use of an appropriate thioldisulfide redox couple and thiol quenching agent@xcite . by these means",
    "the regeneration process can be halted , the intermediate species can be trapped , isolated and characterised .",
    "historically , one of the most investigated proteins containing disulfide bonds has been the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor ( bpti ) .",
    "starting with the work of creighton @xcite a series of crucial studies have accumulated a wealth of evidence in favour of the existence of partially structured intermediates along the protein folding pathway . despite these efforts ,",
    "the detailed characterisation of the intermediates turned out to be a delicate experimental matter and there is still not a universal agreement on whether intermediates contain native or non - native disulfide bonds@xcite and if there exists more than one pathway@xcite . in this context , the use of theoretical and computational tools @xcite has been extremely useful in complementing the experimental findings with a more precise characterisation of the folding pathway , albeit obtained for models that greatly simplify the complexity of the real system .    in this paper",
    "we propose a theoretical scheme to study the folding of proteins with disulfide bonds by suitably exploiting the ( known ) protein native structure . at a general level",
    "our strategy falls in the class of approaches that build on the importance of the native state topology in steering the folding process@xcite , that is in bringing into contact pairs of amino - acid that are found in interaction in the native state . in the past few years",
    "an increasing number of experimental and theoretical studies have confirmed the utility of these approaches in the characterisation of various aspects of protein folding processes @xcite . in the present work",
    "we try to generalise this strategy by adding a suitable treatment of disulfide bonds accounting both for their strength as well as their capability to undergo intra - molecular reshuffling .    in order to validate this approach",
    "we investigate the folding process of the n - terminal core domain of hirudin hm2 from the blood - sucking leech hirudinaria manillensis @xcite .",
    "hirudins are the most potent and specific inhibitors of thrombin ( a key enzyme in blood coagulation ) identified so far , and they are currently used as effective anticoagulants .",
    "hirudin hm2 is composed of a compact n - terminal domain ( residues 1 - 47 ) stabilised by three disulfides ( cys6-cys14 , cys16-cys28 , cys22-cys37 ) and a highly flexible , negatively charged c - terminal tail .",
    "structural studies conducted on several leech - derived disulfide - rich small proteins ( i.e. , hirudin , decorsin , and antistasin ) reveal that although these proteins display negligible sequence similarity and different function they share a common disulfide topology and 3d fold @xcite , suggesting that leeches use the same protein scaffold but different binding epitopes to affect hemostasis . notably , it has been found that these leech antihemostatic proteins possess a t - knot scaffold closely similar to that observed for other unrelated proteins , including b - transforming growth factors , wheat germ agglutinins and snake venom toxins @xcite . in this view , the results of our study may have relevant and more general implication on the elucidation of the folding pathway(s ) of other protein systems .    the first experimental attempts to identify the folding pathway of hirudin date back to the studies of otto and seckler who argued that hirudin could be a viable alternative to bpti and showed that it was experimentally feasible to obtain and follow its unfolding / refolding processes@xcite . as for the case of bpti , also hirudin has been studied in different experiments @xcite leading to alternative formulations of its folding pathway @xcite . in particular when dissolved atmospheric oxygen was used as oxidising agent , the folding process appeared to occur first through the establishment of three non - native ( scrambled ) disulfides and later through their slow rearrangement into the native bonding pattern .",
    "on the contrary , no evidence for the importance of these fully - oxidised disordered intermediates was found in the experiments of thannauser _ et al . _",
    "carried out using oxidised dl - ditiothreitol ( dtt@xmath0 ) .",
    "these alternative views prompted the present investigation of the hirudin pathway within a topology - based model . to ascertain that , despite its simplified nature , the model was suitable to characterize the main aspects of the folding process we have first tuned and validated it against the set of experimental measurements provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . based on the success of this comparison",
    "we have undertaken a detailed characterisation of the folding process by monitoring quantities inaccessible in previous experiments .",
    "our study confirms the experimental evidence of ref .",
    "@xcite suggesting that , under a certain set of experimental conditions , the rate - limiting step of the refolding process involves a transition from a species with two disulfides to ones with the three native disulfides@xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the numerical dynamical trajectories further reveals the precise order of formation of the disulfide bonds .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the 1 - 47 fragment of hirudin@xcite resolved by nmr @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hirudin ] ( see methods and materials section ) .",
    "the fragment under consideration contains three disulfide bonds between residues 6 - 14 , 16 - 28 , 22 - 37 and differs from the whole protein because it lacks the 18-residues long tail ; this tail plays an important role in the biological activity of the protein . however , it is highly mobile due to the virtual absence on any non - covalent contacts with the 1 - 47 globular fragment . for this reason we neglected the hirudin tail in our numerical characterisation of the folding process .",
    "the effective energy scoring function that we adopted belongs to the class of topology - based hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the above mentioned native structure , @xmath1 , is exploited to construct an effective energy function that admits @xmath1 as the lowest energy state .",
    "the simplest form of such energy function is as follows :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the energy of a trial conformation @xmath4 and @xmath5 is its contact matrix , whose elements are 1 [ 0 ] if amino acids @xmath6 and @xmath7 are [ not ] in interaction . a standard criterion based on @xmath8 or @xmath9 distance of pairs of amino acids",
    "is used to decide whether two amino acids are interacting .    in the simple case of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : simple ] ) the energy minimum is attained when all native bonds are established .",
    "such native interactions are weighted equally .",
    "this is a simplification that can be justified when the effective amino acid interactions in the protein are of comparable strength and has the advantage of keeping the model transparent by avoiding the use of imperfect energy parametrisation @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the equal weighting of native contacts does not imply that , in a thermalised ensemble , they are formed with equal probability .",
    "in fact , it is the complex interplay of energy and structural entropy that dictates the most probable routes to the native state from an unfolded conformation as well as the presence of rate - limiting steps due to the establishment of crucial sets of native contacts@xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "the equal weighting of native contacts does not appear to be a good starting point since one has to account for the very energetic disulfide bridges that can occur between pairs of cys .",
    "for this reason , in place of ( [ eqn : simple ] ) we adopt a scoring function consisting of two terms ( see also section methods and materials ) :    @xmath10    @xmath11 enforces some general constraints on the peptide chain geometry and promotes the formation of native contacts between pairs of amino acids other than cys - cys .",
    "these contacts are weighted in the same manner . the second term",
    ", @xmath12 rewards the formation of disulfide bonds between pairs of cysteines .",
    "it is important to stress that the formation of disulfide bonds is allowed among any pair of cys , not only the native ones . by doing",
    "so we can investigate the extent to which species with one or more non - native disulfides are present and if they influence the dynamics toward the native state , as proposed in recent experiments .",
    "the strength of the disulfide bonds relative to other non - covalent interactions is controlled by the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "this parameter should not be regarded as a relative measure of the `` bare '' , i.e. in vacuum , disulfide strength . in fact , since our model does not treat the solvent explicitly , @xmath13 captures the effective strength of disulfide bonds in the presence of water and any other appropriate reducing / oxidising agent . for this reason the value of @xmath13 and",
    "also that of the heat bath temperature , @xmath14 , have to be chosen in a suitable way so to reproduce as accurately as possible the conditions of a given experiment .    in this study",
    "we shall focus on the set of experiments carried out by thannhauser _",
    "@xcite where hirudin was refolded in the presence of various concentrations of @xmath15 .",
    "we shall first show that there exists a well - defined region in the @xmath16 parameter space where the rates of conversion between species with different numbers of disulfides match well those observed in experiments .",
    "this is an important fact since it proves that , despite its simple form , the energy scoring function of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : ham ] ) can indeed be used to characterize the folding process obtaining the correct quantitative experimental picture .",
    "based on such stringent validation of our strategy , we shall then monitor quantities that are inaccessible in current experiments and thus propose a vivid and detailed picture for the hirudin refolding process .",
    "we want to stress the fact that the possibility to reproducing the results of thannhauser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for a suitable choice of the @xmath16 parameters support the hypothesis that our model is general enough to study any folding process involving the formation of disulfide bonds .",
    "the experimental benchmark for our model is provided by a series of hirudin refolding experiments carried out by thannhauser _",
    "@xcite under various concentrations of @xmath15 . by using several combined techniques",
    "it was established that the refolding process occurs under the reaction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model1 ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote respectively the species with 0 , 1 and 2 disulfides ( either native or non - native ) .",
    "a certain species with three disulfides , denoted as @xmath20 was seen to convert with extreme rapidity to native hirudin and was , therefore , identified with a native arrangement of the three disulfide contacts .",
    "the remainder of the ensemble of structures with three disulfides ( i.e. with at least two non - native disulfides ) is therefore denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "the experimental characterisation of thannhauser _ et al _ provides the rates for the individual reactions of the above model for a few choices of the initial concentrations of @xmath15 and the reduced protein species .",
    "our first goal was to see if , for suitably chosen values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 it was possible to reproduce such rates .    , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "the species denoted as @xmath20 contains the three native disulfides . the remainder of the ensemble of structures with three disulfides is therefore denoted as @xmath21.,width=278 ]    several values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 were considered and , for each of them , we measured the rates of conversion between the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 species by using a monte carlo technique .",
    "this was done by keeping track of how many transitions out of any given species occurred and how many of them ended up in each of the other species . to ensure that the obtained dynamics could be interpreted as a ( coarse grained ) viable dynamical trajectory @xcite only tiny local distortions of the peptide chain were attempted in the monte carlo moves . during such coarse - grained trajectories",
    "the formation , breaking or reshuffling of disulfide bonds obeys a set of constraints dictated by the chemistry of the disulfide bonds and the thiol - disulfide coupling .",
    "in particular no cys residue is allowed to participate to more than one disulfide ; the number of disulfide bonds can decrease or increase by at most one unit at each time step , respectively when an existing disulfide is broken or through the establishment of a new disulfide between two previously unbonded cys residues .",
    "intramolecular rearrangements where one bond is broken in favour of a new one ( thus preserving the total number of disulfides ) are also allowed under the requirement that the new bond involves one of the cysteines of the broken disulfide .",
    "a particular care is necessary to ensure that the monte carlo dynamics subject to these constraints does not violate detailed balance .",
    "the difficulties arise from the fact that an elementary mc distortion of distinct starting configurations may result in structures that are compatible with a different number of allowed disulfide bonding patterns .    to overcome this problem we have proceeded as follows : to a newly generated conformation @xmath4 we randomly associate one of the 15 possible pairing patterns of the three disulfides .",
    "if the proposed bonding pattern of the new structure violates the previous criteria , the structure is rejected and time is incremented .",
    "otherwise , the energy function is recalculated and the structure is rejected or accepted with the usual metropolis criterion ( see methods for further details ) . in this way ,",
    "detailed balance is obviously satisfied , since the same number of bonding patterns is proposed for each structure .",
    "the downside is that one encounters frequent metropolis rejections due to the `` blind '' proposal of bonding patterns .",
    "for each of the explored values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 we have measured the correlation between the experimental rates and those obtained numerically . as a measure of the degree of correlation between these two quantities we used the non - parametric kendall analysis @xcite .",
    "this statistical tool allows to establish if there is a relationship between two sets of data and how statistically significant it is .",
    "being based on the comparative ranking of corresponding data in the two sets , the kendall analysis does not rely on any pre - assigned parametric dependence ( e.g. linear ) between the two quantities .",
    "for this reason , it is regarded as a very robust measure of correlation and appears particularly appropriate in this context where the measured rates ( both experimental and numerical ) span several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "our findings are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : correl ] where we have shown the contour and density plot of the kendall correlation coefficient , @xmath22 , against the rates pertaining to the experimental conditions of fig .",
    "5a in ref .",
    "these effective first - order like rates where obtained starting from the best - fit experimental rates of table 2 in ref @xcite multiplied by the asymptotic concentration of dtt@xmath0 or dtt@xmath23 measured under the given experimental conditions ( see fig . 6 in the same reference ) .",
    "a darker / lighter shadow in fig . [ fig : correl ] denotes the presence of a higher / lower degree of correlation .",
    "it is apparent that the experimental data are well reproduced in the neighbourhood of @xmath24 , @xmath25 for which the highest correlation @xmath26 is observed . to ascertain the statistical significance of observing such correlation ,",
    "we have computed the probability to observe , by pure chance a correlation larger than the observed one .",
    "it turns out that this probability ( double - sided ) is equal to @xmath27 , which testifies the statistical significance of the observed correlation .",
    "this establishes that there is a strong monotonic relation between the experimental and theoretical rates",

    "the white regions correspond to the minimum values of the correlations were observed ( @xmath28 ) . the highest correlation , @xmath29 ,",

    "[ fig : opt ] where the good interdependence of the data can be visually inspected .",
    "if one were able to model the folding process with detailed and accurate energy functions one would expect an equality of the theoretical and experimental rates , a part from a time conversion factor . in our case ,",
    "due to the simplicity of our model we do not observe such dependence but encounter , instead , another simple linear relationship between the logarithms of both sets of rates .",
    "this is visible in the linear fit of figure [ fig : correl ] ; the corresponding correlation coefficient is @xmath30 .",
    "its statistical significance ( two - sided ) over the set of 7 data points is 4% which is compatible with the significance of the more general ( and robust ) kendall correlation .",
    "these values indicate that the correlation is highly significant from the statistical point of view .",
    "a further validation can be carried out by comparing the asymptotic concentration of the various species observed in the experiment and in an equilibrated mc trajectory . in case of a perfect correlation between the experimental and numerical rates ,",
    "this further check would be redundant . in this context ,",
    "where the correlation is not perfect ( a significant discrepancy is seen for the transition between the @xmath21 and @xmath19 species ) this validation is useful to ascertain whether the differences in the rates result in significantly different equilibrium conditions .",

    "the presence of a transition at this temperature is further corroborated by the behaviour of the specific heat @xmath41 which displays a clear peak at @xmath42 , the folding temperature , and by the presence of two minima in the free energy profile in fig .",

    "the species with three native disulfides has a free - energy minimum for energies much closer to the native state energy .     and",

    "this effect is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss]a where the average fraction of formed disulfide bonds is portrayed as a function of temperature .",
    "it can be seen that above @xmath44 one has a significant formation of non - native bonds , that are superseded by native ones below @xmath44 .",
    "an alternative picture to this one was put forward by chatrenet and chang based on a hirudin refolding experiment carried out in ref . @xcite . due to the much more oxidising conditions than the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , chatrenet and chang @xcite observed that the folding of hirudin occurred through the formation of intermediates with three ( typically non - native ) formed disulfides . through a slow reshuffling process the disulfides would then rearrange in the native pairing from which the native conformation could be easily reached .",
    "our findings indicate that this alternative scenario could be probably captured by our model by using larger values of the effective disulfide strength @xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the different oxidising solvent conditions @xcite adopted by chatrenet and chang .",
    "( a ) and ( b)@xmath47.,title=\"fig:\",width=278 ] ( b ) and ( b)@xmath47.,title=\"fig:\",width=278 ]    to investigate this regime we explored the value of @xmath48 .",
    "it is important to point out that the folding transition temperature ( identified through the location of the specific heat peak ) is almost insensitive to the disulfide strength in the range @xmath49 . by comparing the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] it is then possible to see that for the higher value of @xmath13 the total number of formed disulfide bonds is higher than for @xmath24 .",
    "this result , accompanied by the fact that the total energy depends weakly on @xmath13 , confirms the intuition that , for large @xmath13 s the disulfides are established at early stages of the folding process when the rest of the protein is still unstructured .",
    "this `` greedy '' disulfide formation not only impacts on the total number of formed disulfides but also on the relative fraction of correct ( native ones ) . as a result ,",
    "a much higher fraction of wrong bonds is found at any temperature , as noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss]b .",
    "this picture suggests that the large @xmath13 regime of our model may be compatible with the scenario proposed by chatrenet and chang where the rate - limiting step corresponded to the disentanglement of non - native disulfides in intermediates states with three formed disulfide bonds .",
    "however , for this alternative case the experimental rates are not available and we can not corroborate in a more quantitative way the parallel between the experimental conditions of chatrenet and chang and the `` large '' @xmath13 regime in our model .",
    "so far we have focused on the overall thermodynamic characterisation of the refolding of hirudin , paying a particular attention to the validation of our model against experimental data .",
    "having established that the detailed experimental reaction rates of ref .",
    "@xcite can be well reproduced we can confidently use our model to investigate finer aspects of the refolding process .",
    "we begin by examining the details of formation of the native arrangement of disulfides .",
    "our interest is to find whether the formation of the @xmath20 species is aided by the establishment of some non - native disulfides that are later broken in favour of native bondings .",
    "to do so , instead of subdividing the structures according to just the overall number of disulfides we indexed them with a pair of numbers , @xmath50 denoting the number of correct ( native ) disulfides , @xmath51 and wrong ( non - native ) ones , @xmath52 . in this way the fully reduced state , @xmath17 ,",
    "is indicated as ( 0,0 ) while the @xmath20 state corresponds to ( 3,0 ) .",
    "altogether there are nine possible states , as indicated in fig.[fig : model2 ] .        we have generated several mc trajectories , each spanning about 20 million time steps ( see sections methods and materials ) at ( @xmath25 , @xmath24 ) and then recorded the probability of occurrence of all allowed transitions between the states of fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] .",
    "the typical dispersion on the measured rates over ten mc trajectories was typically less than 1% but augmented to about 10 % for the few very improbable transitions .",
    "then we have considered all possible productive routes taking from @xmath17 to @xmath20 in a preassigned number of transitions .",
    "the probability of occurrence for any such routes is obtained by multiplying the individual probabilities of any of the elementary steps . by considering productive routes involving an increasing number of transitions it can be established that the most probable route ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model2 ] ) is @xmath53 which is more than ten times as likely than the second ranking paths which is @xmath54 .",
    "these findings seem robust against variations of the parameters in our model .",
    "for example , even changing the temperature to 0.8 ( keping @xmath24 ) so that the formation of native species is strongly favoured ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ss]a ) it is found that the top ranking routes taking from the reduced state to the native one are the same as above .",
    "interestingly , the relative weight ratio of the top productive routes is analogous to the one encountered for @xmath25 ; on the other hand the fact that the native formation is highly favoured at @xmath55 is reflected in an increase , by several orders of magnitude , of the weight of the productive routes .",
    "we complete the present section by identifying the rate limiting steps of the folding process .",
    "in a sequential reaction the rate limiting step is straightforwardly identified as the slowest one . in the present scheme",
    "such simple analysis can not be carried out due to the presence of several alternative routes that can take to the native state . an objective and convenient way to identify the rate limiting step in such a situation is to identify the reaction whose rate change affects the most the production of the species of interest , in this case @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , by using the measured rates for the transitions between the states of fig . [",
    "fig : model2 ] we have integrated the associated master equations starting from a fully reduced population .",
    "we have then changed by 10 % each of the rates and identified the time at which the concentration of @xmath20 crosses a pre - assigned threshold value . we found that , almost independently of the threshold value , the most sensitive step among all the allowed ones was @xmath56 which is the last step of the most probable route leading to @xmath20 . in principle",
    "this may have not been the case , especially in the presence of equally important paths leading to @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that the most probable routes include the rate limiting steps confirms the existence of a well defined succession of events taking to the native state .    as mentioned before , based on experimental dynamical plots , thannhauser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite had determined that the rate limiting step was the @xmath36 one . in their study",
    "it was not possible to characterise by direct means whether the transition to the @xmath20 state occurred from a @xmath19 state comprising only native cysteine bonds , although this was reputed to be the most likely scenario .",
    "our picture thus fully supports the experimental results concerning the @xmath36 rate - limiting step , but also adds novel insight in the process by indicating explicitly that the most crucial step involves a particular @xmath19 species , namely one with two native disulfides . in the remainder of this section",
    "we shall further characterise the folding process by identifying which of the native disulfides are formed in the most probable routes ( or rate - limiting steps ) .",
    "this is done by following a series of individual dynamical trajectories where the native conformation is reached starting from a reduced state .",
    "the monte - carlo procedure allows for a detailed study of the folding pathways and for a systematic analysis of the specific order of formation of disulfide bonds . by setting @xmath24 the protein",
    "is initially thermalised at an high temperature ( @xmath57 ) where , in our model , the disulfide bonds are completely reduced and then suddenly quenched to @xmath58 . for each kinetic trajectory the order of formation of the disulfide bonds was stored and a statistical analysis accomplished by comparing several runs .",
    "in particular we have recorded the exact type of disulfide bridges forming the different species ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) and from their relative concentration we have inferred the pathway .",
    "the six cys residues of the fully reduced protein , 6 , 14 , 16 , 22 , 28 , 37 are equally likely to participate in forming the initial disulfide bond .",
    "although in the early folding stages the contact @xmath59 appears quite frequently due to the short sequence distance between the amino - acids , after the molecule has equilibrated through a series of rapid internal disulfide interchange reactions , only 5 of the 15 possible @xmath18 states exist in significant quantities .",
    "they are : ( 6 - 14 ) , ( 6 - 16 ) , ( 16 - 22 ) , ( 28 - 37 ) that are respectively present in the following equilibrium concentrations : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the most common bond among the @xmath18 ensemble is a non - native one , ( 28 - 37 ) , while the only native bond that is present in significant quantities is ( 6 - 14 ) .",
    "of the 45 possible @xmath19 states , seven occur in significant quantities .",
    "two of them , ( 6 - 14;16 - 28 ) present in the @xmath64 of the cases and ( 6 - 14,22 - 37 ) present in the @xmath65 of the cases , are formed by native bonds .",
    "other two , ( 6 - 14;16 - 22 ) and ( 6 - 14,28 - 37 ) present with concentration of @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , have a native and a non - native contact . whereas the last three , ( 6 - 16,28 - 37 ) with a frequency of @xmath68 , ( 14 - 22,28 - 37 ) with a frequency of @xmath60 and ( 16 - 22,28 - 37 ) with a frequency of @xmath60 , are formed by non - native disulfide bonds . the relatively high concentration of species with non - native states , which are not present in the most probable productive routes expected for the folding ( see the previous section ) , reflect the particular experimental conditions reproduced here ( induced by the choice of @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) in which the formation of the native state is not particularly favoured ( see fig . [",
    "fig : opt]b ) .",
    "the analysis of the folding pathway reported in the previous section and the statistical analysis of the dynamical productive pathway can be summarised in the following re - folding picture : the reduced proteins forms first the native contact @xmath69 and consequently either the states ( 6 - 14;16 - 28 ) or ( 6 - 14,28 - 37 ) almost with the same probability . the folding proceeds with the formation of the last disulfide bond .",
    "this conversion is relatively slow in agreement with the finding of the previous section on the rate limiting step of the reaction .",
    "the presence of conformation with three scrambled disulfide bonds turns out not to be statistically significant also from this kinetic analysis . a graphical representation of the most probable trajectory is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pathway ] .",
    "the fact that the majority of structures sampled in the quenching process involve non - native bonding patterns is not in contradiction with the findings of the previous section , where the most probable _ productive _ route was shown to be free of non - native bonds .",
    "in fact , the high concentration of structures with non - native bonds does not automatically imply that they contribute significantly to the refolding `` flux '' towards the native state . on the contrary ,",
    "species involving native bonds even if they do not accumulate to high equilibrium concentration , appear to take part to the most efficient routes leading to the native state .",
    "the structure of the synthetic analogues of fragment 1 - 47 of hirudin hm2 in the free state was modelled on the nmr solution structure of natural fragment 1 - 47 @xcite , almost super - imposable to that of the corresponding segment ( 1 - 49 ) in intact hirudin hv1 variant@xcite ( pdb code : 5hir ) , showing @xmath70 sequence identity with hirudin hm2 , or to that of hv1 fragment 1 - 51 @xcite ( pdb code : 1hic ) . the best - representative model in the nmr ensemble",
    "was selected using the program olderado @xcite available on - line at the site http://neon.chem.le.ac.uk .      in our model",
    "a generic conformation @xmath71 of the protein is modelled as a self - avoiding chain of connected @xmath8 atoms located at position @xmath72 , where @xmath6 is the amino - acid chain index ( ranging from 1 to 47 ) .",
    "starting from the @xmath8 coordinates the peptide dihedral angles are calculated and hence , following standard geometrical rules @xcite we construct an effective @xmath73 centroid for all residues with the exception of the two end residues and the seven glycines ( indices : 10,18,23,25,34,40,42 ) .",
    "the energy scoring function consists of two terms .",
    "the first one incorporates a standard bias toward the formation of native non - disulfide bonds but also disfavours the formation of non - native bonds ( except for disulfide ones ) and penalises significant deviations from the native dihedral angles .",
    "these details are known to improve the cooperatively of the modelled folding process @xcite .",
    "the explicit expression of this term , evaluate on a trial structure @xmath4 is given by :    @xmath74 \\nonumber \\\\ & -   6 \\left ( { \\frac{r^n_{ij}}{r_{ij } } } \\right)^{10 } \\\\ & +   v_1 \\ \\sum^{'}_{i , j > i+2 }   \\left [ 1-\\delta_{ij}(\\gamma^{n } ) \\right ] \\left ( \\frac{r^n_{ij}}{r_{ij } } \\right)^{12 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + v_2 \\left [ \\sum_{i=2,46 } ( \\theta_i - \\theta_i^{n})^{2 } + \\sum_{i=3,46 } ( \\phi_i - \\phi_i^{n})^{2 } \\right]\\nonumber \\\\ & + v_{constraints}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath75 denotes the distance of the @xmath6th and @xmath7th @xmath8 atoms in the trial structure @xmath4 ; a superscript @xmath76 is used to denote analogous quantities pertaining to the native structure .",
    "the contact map @xmath77 is computed by considering as threshold a distance of 8 @xmath78 between the @xmath8 atoms .",
    "the prime in the summation indicates that no contribution is considered if both the amino - acids are cys .",
    "finally , the angular term has been constructed using the standard dihedral angles , @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81,@xmath82 and @xmath83 are used to control the strength of interactions and are set equal to 1 , 5 and 1 energy units , respectively . the last term in the expression , @xmath84 ,",
    "is used to enforce a series of knowledge - based constraints whose violation is penalised through an `` infinite '' energy penalty ( that is through a rejection of the violating conformation ) .",
    "the constraints are as follows : ( 1 ) the distance between two consecutive @xmath8 atoms must remain in the interval 3.7 - 3.9  , ( 2 ) the distance between two non consecutive @xmath8 atoms must be greater than 4  , ( 3 ) the distance between any two @xmath9 must be greater than 2 @xmath78 and ( 4 ) the distance between any two @xmath8 and @xmath9 centroids must be greater than 2  .",
    "the second term of the hamiltonian , @xmath12 rewards the formation of disulfides , irrespective of whether they are native or not . as explained in the next subsection , each proposed configuration , described in terms of @xmath85 s and @xmath73 s , comes with a set of three putative bonds among the six cysteines . of these putative bonds only those among residues",
    "whose @xmath73 s are a separation smaller than 5   are considered to be effectively present and hence give a contribution equal to @xmath86 to the total energy .",
    "as mentioned in the text , we used monte carlo dynamics for studying the folding process . at each monte - carlo step the current structure is distorted through local deformations @xcite based on two equally - probable moves : ( a ) _ single - bead move : _ a random @xmath87-carbon is chosen and is displaced randomly by at most 1 along each cartesian direction , ( b ) _ crankshaft move : _ two sites , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with sequence separation at most 6 are chosen and all the sites between them are rotated around the axis joining @xmath6 and @xmath7 by an angle chosen randomly in the interval @xmath88 . as mentioned before , besides this structural rearrangement , at each monte carlo step we also associate a randomly - chosen pairing pattern for the six cysteines so that each of them is involved in a _ putative _ disulfide bond .",
    "these bonds are termed putative because , to satisfy detailed balance , the pairing assignment is done blindly that is without inspecting whether a given pair of cysteines is at a distance compatible with the existence of a disulfide bond .",
    "one then checks whether ( irrespective of the pairing distances ) the proposed bonding pattern is compatible with the undistorted configuration , i.e. if it respects the rules of section 2.1 about disulfide formation and thiol / disulfide coupling . if not the configuration is rejected , the monte carlo clock is advanced and a new distortion and bonding pattern is considered .",
    "otherwise one proceeds as in ordinary metropolis schemes after having calculated the energy of the proposed configuration .",
    "it is important to notice that this latter step involves the inspection of the distance of the putatively bonded cysteines to reward only those bonds that are geometrically feasible .    the efficiency of the monte - carlo algorithm to study the thermodynamics was enhanced by the multiple markov - chain sampling scheme@xcite , a method that has proved quite effective in exploring the low temperature phase diagrams of proteins and interacting polymers .",
    "all the runs have been performed by covering the temperature range of interest , @xmath89 $ ] , with 20 markov chains uniformly - spaced in temperature .",
    "the data obtained in the multiple - markov - chain runs at different values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 were further processed through a generalised multiple histogram technique inspired by the work of ref .",
    "this strategy allowed to reconstruct faithfully the density of states ( number of configurations ) in the multi - dimensional space of reaction coordinates constituted by @xmath11 and the number of correct ( native ) and wrong ( non - native ) disulfides : @xmath90 .",
    "the data from the different runs were combined so to minimize the error propagation on the density of states .",
    "the typical uncertainty of the reconstructed free - energy at the values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 considered here is about 0.5 energy unit ( this estimate follows from the analysis of free energy dispersion when half of the collected data is used ) . by these means it was possible to obtain the total energy and specific heat curves of fig .",

    "[ fig : freemu5 ] .",
    "we have proposed a theoretical framework to model and study the folding of proteins containing disulfide bonds .",
    "the approach is based on the knowledge of the native state of a protein but contains an appropriate term to account for the possibility that native or non - native disulfide bonds can form .",
    "the main advantage of the model proposed here is its simplicity which allows for a detailed description of all the folding pathways through the monitoring of the correct / incorrect contact formation .",
    "the model has been validated by investigating the debated re - folding pathways of hirudin which has been object of several experimental studies .",
    "it was shown that there exists a region in our two - dimensional parameter space where the rates of conversions between different oxidised species are in good agreement with experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "starting from this successful comparison we have then attempted a detailed characterisation of the whole folding process .    at a coarse - grained level our results",
    "is consistent with the scenario described by thannhauser _",
    "@xcite suggesting that the rate limiting step turns out to be @xmath91 . our approach , that allow for a precise identification of the formed contacts , shows clearly that the @xmath19 state appears to involve native intermediates , possibility that was reputed as the most probable situation in ref .",
    "@xcite although experimentally it was impossible to show it directly .",
    "the analysis of several folding trajectories also allowed the identification of the most probable folding route and the typical associated succession of formation of disulfide bridges .",
    "furthermore , the thermodynamics of the system was elucidated by using statistical mechanical techniques to reconstruct the free energy profiles for the whole system and also for the different oxidised species .    due to its simplicity ,",
    "the proposed model , can not capture those aspects of the folding process that result from the delicate interplay of amino acid specific interactions .",
    "the successful comparison of the theoretical predictions for hirudin with the experimental findings suggests that also , for disulfide containing proteins , suitable topology - based models can be profitably used to elucidate the folding pathways , even in the presence of non - native intermediates .",
    "thus , the present approach , which is general and not specifically tailored for hirudin , ought to be straightforwardly applicable in other contexts providing a useful complement of experimental techniques in the characterisation of the folding process in the presence of disulfide bonds .",
