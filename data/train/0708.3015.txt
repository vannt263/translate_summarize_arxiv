    "<S> we apply the parton recombination approach to study the energy dependence of the elliptic flow , @xmath0 in heavy ion collisions from ags to lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant input quantities ( @xmath1 ) at the various center of mass energies are obtained from fits to the available data . </S>",
    "<S> the model yields a good description of the integrated @xmath0 data for charged particles at midrapidity from ags to rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> in stark contrast to the current expectations , we observe a decrease of the integrated @xmath0 values above the highest rhic energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we predict a decrease of @xmath0 at lhc energies compared to the rhic results . </S>",
    "<S> this drop is attributed to negative @xmath0 values for the underlying parton distributions at low to moderate transverse momenta that develops if the transverse flow velocity is high enough . at energies above the lhc regime , </S>",
    "<S> the present approach predicts even negative values for the integrated @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of the current and past heavy ion programs is the search for a new state of matter called the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> major breakthroughs for the potential discovery @xcite of this new state of matter where ( i ) the experimental discovery of a large elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> this lead to the conclusion , that the matter formed in the early stage of a heavy ion reaction at rhic behaves like a nearly perfect liquid ( i.e. a liquid with a low viscosity ) ( @xcite and refs . </S>",
    "<S> therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the observation of constituent quark number scaling @xmath2 , meaning that the elliptic flow of baryons ( three quarks , @xmath3 ) versus mesons ( two quarks , @xmath4 ) ) scales like @xmath5 at the hadron transverse momentum @xmath6 . while the details of this scaling are still under discussion @xcite , one might generally see this scaling as evidence for a recombination like hadronization process for the transition of partonic matter to hadronic matter @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we will apply the recombination approach to explore the energy dependence of the elliptic flow in massive ( pb+pb / au+au ) nucleus - nucleus reactions from the ags energies to the highest lhc energy . for complemantory explorations of the elliptic flow at lhc within transport </S>",
    "<S> approaches the reader is referred to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow is a well chosen observable for the exploration of the energy dependence of flow observables , because it exhibits a self quenching effect and is therefore mostly sensitive to the early ( partonic ) stage of the reaction , even at rather low beam energies . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of this letter is as follows : we start with a summary of the energy dependence of the input parameters , then we discuss shortly the relevant recombination formulas , finally we present the results for the elliptic flow excitation function and the predictions for lhc .    to apply this model to other energies than rhic ( @xmath7 ) one has to model the dependence of the temperature @xmath8 , the baryo - chemical potential @xmath9 and the transverse flow rapidity @xmath10 at the hadronization surface as a function of the center of mass energy . </S>",
    "<S> details of the parameterisations can be found in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the values for rhic energies and below are fitted to previously extracted flow velocities , at lhc energies , we obtain the values ( for @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are in line with previous estimates @xcite .    with these parameters </S>",
    "<S> we predict the elliptic flow of hadrons using the collinear recombination approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since we are presently only interested in bulk ( i.e. low @xmath15 quantities , we apply the recombination prescription in the low to intermediate @xmath15-range from 0 to about 3  gev at rhic and about 5 - 6  gev at lhc respectively , above this momentum , fragmentation will dominate the underlying quark distribution . comparing the yields to experiment </S>",
    "<S> the formalism seems applicable down to @xmath16 at rhic , which is approximately 3% of the matter produced , and we expect this lower limit to rise slightly to @xmath17 at lhc . so using the recombination approach down to @xmath18 seems questionable , however , a part of the uncertainty in the recombination mechanism at low @xmath15 , introduced by the violation of energy conservation , cancels after taking the ratios in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : v2_definition ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the recombination formalism seems to give valid results for @xmath0 down to transverse momenta of several hundred mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further justification about the validity of our results can be found in the paragraph about the mean @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the picture that one quark and one anti - quark ( or three quarks ) with collinear momenta can recombine to form a meson ( baryon ) leads one to an integral over the product of the constituent - quark densities @xmath19 times the wigner function of the hadron @xmath20 with the freeze - out hyper - surface @xmath21 and its normal vector @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23 were the quark @xmath24 carries the fraction @xmath25 of the hadron momentum @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the parameterisations from @xcite with a pure thermal spectrum for the recombining quarks and do not include the power - law - tail which is only relevant for fragmentation . at higher cm - energies recombination </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be dominant up to even higher @xmath15 @xcite , therefore , we neglect the contributions from fragmentation for the present considerations . following @xcite we obtain the elliptic flow for non - central reactions from the asymmetry of the overlap region . </S>",
    "<S> to model peripheral collisions the asymmetry @xmath27 of the collision depends on the geometric width and height of the transverse overlap zone @xmath28 as @xmath29 we have compared this simple asymmetry parameter with the eccentricity from other parameterisations in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ plt : asymmetry ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that the @xmath27 parameter used ( full line ) is quantitatively close to the glauber model ( short dashed line ) calculation for the relevant impact parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been speculated that a much sharper color glass condensate initial distribution might be present in the initial state , this parametrisation is depicted by the long dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> the cgc values for the eccentricity are slightly higher and lead to a small quantitative change of the final @xmath0 values , however the qualitative feature of a @xmath0 decrease at high energies is not affected .     to the eccentricity from cgc and the glauber model @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> this spatial asymmetry is translated into a velocity asymmetry in the parton phase by @xmath30 to account for the fact that faster partons will experience this anisotropy less than slower ones we define @xmath31 with the parameter @xmath32  gev taken from @xcite . the elliptic flow is then given by @xmath33 and is calculated for the individual quark species as @xcite @xmath34 k_1 \\left[b(\\phi)\\right ] \\ </S>",

    "<S> let us start by comparing the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow for pions , kaons , protons and omega - baryons in mid - peripheral au+au reactions at rhic to the distributions obtained in mid - peripheral pb+pb reactions at the lhc as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ plt : pt - v2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> a first striking observation is that the @xmath45 values at each given @xmath15 are always lower at the lhc than at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> a similar pattern was also observed within a parton transport approach , if the viscosity was set to the ads / cft limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even more surprising , we find strong out - of - plane emission of ( multi-)strange particles , i.e. negative values of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these negative values of the elliptic flow parameter for heavy particles have also been found in previous exploratory studies and seem to be a general feature of the blast - wave like flow profile at high transverse velocities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the negative @xmath0 values have also be seen within a blast - wave fit of the proton elliptic flow to star data @xcite and they have also been experimentally observed by the na49 collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results are supported by the recent preliminary data on j/@xmath46 elliptic flow from phenix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it reflects the depletion of the low @xmath15 particle abundance , when the source elements are highly boosted in the transverse direction . at higher </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 and or lower transverse flow velocities , the opposite effect dominates and results in a more pronounced emission in - plane again . </S>",
    "<S> the details depend on the underlying transverse flow parameterisation as discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one might argue that negative elliptic flow values are an artefact of the blast wave parametrisation , however , also transport simulations indicate slightly negative @xmath0 values for heavy particles at very low @xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the qualitative behaviour of a negative @xmath0 is a well - known observation . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising observation in the present work is the quantitative strength of this effect at lhc .    from these arguments </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the blast - wave flow profile is responsible for the negative @xmath0 on the quark level , which then enters the hadron elliptic flow via the parton recombination . to understand this effect in more detail </S>",
    "<S> we go to the thermal quark - spectrum @xcite with the energy @xmath47 for simplicity we look at midrapidity ( @xmath48 ) and for high @xmath49 the spectrum is very low , so we consider the region around @xmath50 . for high cm - energies , when the source is highly boosted transversally , the particles will mainly be emitted in the direction in which the fireball flies , so we can simplify even more and set @xmath51 . because we have no longitudinal momentum we can replace the momentum with the transverse rapidity of the parton : @xmath52 and @xmath53 . so the energy of the quark in the transverse moving source is @xmath54\\ ] ] for a fixed quark rapidity @xmath55 ( low @xmath15 ) the energy of the quarks emitted in plane is higher than the energy of quarks emitted out of plane . with the thermal spectrum more </S>",
    "<S> energy means less particles , therefore a negative @xmath0 . at @xmath56 one </S>",
    "<S> would expect the zero - crossing , and above a positive @xmath0 .    in this way one can visualise </S>",
    "<S> our predicted negative elliptic flow for low @xmath15 at lhc . at rhic </S>",
    "<S> this picture can not be applied , because the simplification @xmath51 is only valid for high @xmath57 ( high cm - energies ) .    a different way to obtain an analytic expression which explains the negative @xmath0 is to consider only the in - plane ( @xmath58 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath59 ) directions ( similar to the analysis performed in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 integration breaks down and the elliptic flow is then given by @xmath61 k_1 \\left[b(0)\\right ] - i_2 \\left[a(\\pi/2)\\right ] k_1 \\left[b(\\pi/2)\\right ] } { i_0 \\left[a(0)\\right ] k_1 \\left[b(0)\\right ] + i_0 \\left[a(\\pi/2)\\right ] k_1 \\left[b(\\pi/2)\\right]}\\ ] ] for @xmath62 the argument of the bessel functions @xmath41 goes to zero and @xmath41 becomes constant with @xmath63 and @xmath64 </S>",
