    "high - magnification events for which the background source star passes close to the host star are very sensitive for detection of planets @xcite .",
    "this is because the central caustic induced by a planet is formed near the host star and thus produces central perturbations near the peak of the lensing light curve .",
    "@xcite studied planet detectability in high - magnification events and they showed that earth - mass planets may be detected with 1 m class telescopes . hence ,",
    "current microlensing follow - up observations have focused on high - magnification events and have resulted so far in the detection of 14 planets out of 25 extrasolar planets detected by microlensing ( udalski et al . 2005 ; gould et al . 2006 ; gaudi et al .",

    "high - magnification events are sensitive to the diameter of the source star because the source star passes close to the central caustic .",
    "if the source diameter is bigger than the central caustic and thus the finite - source effect is strong , central perturbations induced by the central caustic are greatly washed out , thus making it difficult to realize the existence of planets .",
    "events moa-2007-blg-400 ( subo et al . 2009 ) , moa-2008-blg-310 ( janczak et al . 2010 ) , and moa-2010-blg-311 ( yee et al .",
    "2013 ) were high - magnification events with strong finite - source effects .",
    "all three events had complete coverage over the peak , but a secure planet detection occurred in only two events , moa-2007-blg-400 and moa-2008-blg-310 .",
    "even though the event moa-2010-blg-311 had complete coverage over the peak , central perturbations around the peak were extremely weak with a fractional deviation of @xmath0 so that it gave rise to a @xmath6 of the best - fit planetary lens model from the single lens model .",
    "@xcite reported that the planetary signal of @xmath6 is below the detection threshold range of @xmath7 suggested by @xcite , and thus it is difficult to claim a secure detection of the planet .",
    "this suggests that extremely weak central perturbations ( hereafter ewcps ) of the deviations @xmath0 produce planetary signals below the detection threshold and obstruct a confident detection of planets .",
    "current follow - up observations are intensively monitoring high - magnification events and their photometric error reaches @xmath8 at the peak , but it is not enough to get a confident detection of planets in ewcp events with deviations @xmath0 , as shown in the event moa-2010-blg-311 . for confident planet detection in ewcp events ,",
    "it is necessary to have both high cadence monitoring and high photometric accuracy better than those of current follow - up observation systems .",
    "the next - generation ground - based observation project , kmtnet ( korea microlensing telescope network ) , satisfies the conditions .",
    "the kmtnet will use a 1.6 m wide - field telescope at each of three southern sites , chile , south africa , and australia , to perform a 24 hr continuous observation toward the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "each telescope has a @xmath9 ccd camera that covers a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath10 and it will observe four fields with a total fov of @xmath11 , in which each field will be monitored with an exposure time of about 2 minutes and a detector readout time of about 30 seconds giving a cadence of 10 minutes ( kim et al . 2010 ; atwood et al .",
    "hence , kmtnet has high potential for the detection of planetary signals in ewcp events . here , we study how well planets in ewcp high - magnification events can be detected by the kmtnet .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we briefly describe the properties of the central caustic induced by a planet . in   3 , we estimate the probability of occurrence of ewcp events with deviations @xmath1 in high - magnification events and the efficiency of detecting planets in the ewcp events using kmtnet . in   4 , we discuss the observational limitations and other potential studies of the kmtnet .",
    "we summarize the results and conclude in   5 .",
    "in planetary lensing composed of a host star and a planet , the signal of the planet is a short - duration perturbation on the standard single lensing light curve of the host star .",
    "the perturbation is caused by the central and planetary caustics , which are typically separated from each other .",
    "the central caustic is always formed close to the host star and thus the perturbation by the central caustic occurs near the peak of the lensing light curve , while the planetary caustic is formed away from the host star and thus the perturbation by the planetary caustic can occur at any part of the light curve .",
    "central perturbations caused by the central caustic have generally a property of the @xmath12 degeneracy ( griest & safizadeh 1998 ; dominik 1999 ) .",
    "the degeneracy arises due to the similarity in the size and shape of the central caustics for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the duration of the central perturbations is proportional to the size of the central caustic .",
    "the size of the central caustic defined by the separation of the cusps on the star - planet axis @xcite is expressed by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the planet / star mass ratio . according to equation ( 1 ) ,",
    "the size of the central caustic is @xmath17 for @xmath18 and is @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the finite source effect for high - magnification events becomes important because the source star passes close to the central caustic , as mentioned before .",
    "the magnification of a finite source corresponds to the magnification averaged over the source surface , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the point source magnification , @xmath23 represents the source brightness profile , @xmath24 is the vector to a position on the source star surface with respect to the center of the source star , @xmath25 is the displacement vector of the source center with respect to the lens , and @xmath26 is the source radius normalized to the einstein radius of the lens system , @xmath27 , which is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the distances to the lens and the source from the observer , respectively .",
    "based on the result of the high - magnification event moa-2010-blg-311 ( yee et al . 2013 ) mentioned in section 1 , we choose that the threshold of ewcps is a fractional deviation of @xmath31 , which is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the lensing magnifications with and without a planet , respectively . to investigate the frequency of ewcp events in high - magnification events of @xmath35",
    ", we estimate the probability of occurrence of ewcp events with @xmath36 . in consideration of typical galactic bulge events , we assume that the mass and distance of the host star lens are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the distance of the source star is @xmath39",
    ". then , the angular and physical einstein radii of the lens system are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we adopt three different source stars including main - sequence , subgiant , and giant stars , which have radii of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the radii of the three source stars normalized to the einstein radius are @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for high - magnification events ,",
    "the effect of limb darkening of the finite source surface is not negligible , so we adopt a brightness profile for the source star of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the linear and square - root coefficients and @xmath50 is the angle between the normal to the surface of the source star and the line of sight @xcite .",
    "we assume that the coefficients ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) of main - sequence , subgiant , and giant stars are ( 0.08 , 0.52 ) , ( 0.11 , 0.51 ) , and ( 0.21 , 0.46 ) , respectively .    figure 1 shows the probability of occurrence of ewcp events with @xmath36 as a function of the projected star - planet separation in units of @xmath27 , @xmath13 , and planet / star mass ratio , @xmath16 . the physical separation , @xmath51 , and planet mass in units of earth mass , @xmath52 , are also presented in the figure , where they are determined by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . in each panel ,",
    "different shades of grey represent the areas with the probabilities of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "as one may expect , the probability increases as the mass ratio decreases and the separation decreases for @xmath59 and increases for @xmath60 . from the figure",
    ", we find that for @xmath3 planets with separations of @xmath4 , ewcp events with @xmath36 in high - magnification events of @xmath35 occur with a frequency of @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that high - magnification events of @xmath35 are mostly ewcp events of @xmath36 , thus it is important to resolve the ewcp events for the detection of many different planetary systems . in figure 1",
    ", the reason a bump occurs at @xmath61 is that regions with small fractional deviations around the center of the resonant caustic are rather widely formed @xcite .",
    "the vertical line of the @xmath58 probability in the figure represents the boundary of the lensing zone of @xmath62 , where the planetary caustic is located within the einstein ring . because of the planetary caustic",
    ", the probability of occurrence of @xmath36 events can not reach @xmath58 within the lensing zone , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "however , if the finite source effect is strong , the probability can reach @xmath58 at @xmath63 , since there exist regions with small fractional deviations within the resonant caustic , as mentioned before ( see the bottom panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "table 1 shows in detail the probability for the three source stars presented in figure 1 .      to estimate the efficiency of detecting planets in ewcp events of @xmath36 , we compute the detectability defined as the ratio of the fractional deviation ( @xmath64 ) to the photometric accuracy ( @xmath65 ) , i.e. , @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent the baseline flux of the lensed source star and the blended background flux , respectively .",
    "we assume that the i - band absolute magnitudes of the main - sequence , subgiant , and giant stars are @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we assume that the extinction toward the galactic bulge is @xmath71 and the blended flux @xmath68 is equivalent to the flux of the background star with the apparent magnitude of @xmath72 .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the three source stars affected by the assumed extinction are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . considering typical galactic bulge events",
    ", we also assume that the einstein timescale is @xmath75 days .",
    "based on the specification of kmtnet systems , we assume that the instrument can detect 31 photons @xmath76 for a @xmath72 star and the monitoring frequency is once per 10 minutes , having an exposure time of 2 minutes , and the lower limit of the photometric accuracy is @xmath77 , which corresponds to the value at @xmath78 mag ( atwood et al .",
    "we assume that the planetary signal is detectable if @xmath79 .",
    "we also assume that the planet is detected only if the planetary signal with @xmath79 is detected at least five times during the event .",
    "the five points with @xmath79 do not need to be consecutive , because events with this requirement have @xmath80 , which satisfies the detection threshold for high - magnification events @xcite .",
    "we note that since the single lensing magnification @xmath34 is unknown in actual observations , it is determined from the best - fit single lens model to the observed planetary lensing event .",
    "the lensing parameters of the best - fit single lens event are obtained by a @xmath81 minimization method @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the planet detection efficiency of ewcp events with @xmath36 for three different source stars , as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath16 . from the figure",
    ", we find the following results .    1 .",
    "ewcp events of @xmath82 generally have two separations with the maximum detection efficiency due to the @xmath12 degeneracy , and the efficiency decreases as @xmath13 becomes smaller and/or larger than the maximum efficiency separation that changes with the planet mass .",
    "this is because the photometric accuracy of the observation systems is limited , thus it does not allow the efficiency for each @xmath16 to continuously increase as @xmath13 decreases for @xmath59 and increases for @xmath60 .",
    "this result implies that the planet detection in ewcp events occurs only within a limited separation range which depends on the planet mass .",
    "2 .   for main - sequence and subgiant stars ,",
    "@xmath5 planets in ewcp events of @xmath36 can be detected @xmath2 in a certain range that changes with the planet mass .",
    "the range for the two stars is presented in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "ewcp events are caused by close , intermediate , and wide planetary systems with low - mass planets and close and wide planetary systems with massive planets .",
    "these planetary systems are quite different from those already detected , which are mostly intermediate planetary systems with @xmath63 regardless of the planet mass .",
    "therefore , the above results imply that a much greater variety of planetary systems can be significantly detected in the near future .",
    "we also compare the estimated detection efficiency with the probability in the same range . as a result",
    ", the efficiency for @xmath5 planets increases to @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath84 for main - sequence , subgiant , and giant stars , respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath5 planets located within the certain range can almost be detected by kmtnet . the efficiency compared with the probability , i.e.",
    ", the ratio of the efficiency to the probability , is presented in tables 2 , 3 , and 4 . in figure 2 ,",
    "the white solid and dashed lines represent the set of points where the probabilities of occurrence of events with @xmath85 and @xmath86 are both @xmath87 . from the figure",
    ", we find that kmtnet can readily resolve up to ewcp events of @xmath88 .",
    "the planet detection efficiency is sensitive to the einstein timescale of a lensing event .",
    "this is because under the condition of the limited monitoring frequency of a system , the decrease of the timescale gives rise to a decrease of the chance of detecting planets during the event .",
    "we thus test the change of the detection efficiency depending on the einstein timescale .",
    "figure 3 represents the detection efficiency changing with the einstein timescale for the planetary system of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the efficiency dramatically increases until @xmath91 days , but it becomes constant for @xmath92 days , as shown in the figure .",
    "this means that the estimated efficiency for three source stars is valid up to ewcp events with @xmath93 days , whereas for events with @xmath91 days it considerably decreases with @xmath94 .",
    "most high - magnification events of @xmath35 are ewcp events of @xmath36 and kmtnet is capable of resolving the ewcp events , as shown in the results of figures 1 and 2",
    ". however , the kmtnet is more favorable for the detection of events caused by the planetary caustic than those caused by the central caustic ( high - magnification events ) .",
    "this is because the kmtnet plans to do 24-hour continuous observation with a constant exposure time of 2 minutes and the exposure time is applied for stars of @xmath95 mag @xcite .",
    "hence , if a source star is highly magnified by @xmath96 mag , it is easy for the kmtnet to be saturated around the peak of the high - magnification event with a 2-minute exposure time .",
    "this means that it is difficult to detect planets in ewcp events of bright stars like giant stars using kmtnet .",
    "the estimated detection efficiency for main - sequence and subgiant stars also includes those cases where the source stars are highly magnified by @xmath96 mag , and thus the efficiency would decrease in real observations .",
    "however , since one considers only high - magnification events with @xmath35 , kmtnet has a chance of detecting ewcp events of more dark stars of @xmath97 mag .",
    "the result of the test for the @xmath97 stars shows that the kmtnet can resolve up to ewcp events of @xmath98 stars .",
    "figure 4 shows an example light curve of a @xmath99 star highly magnified by the planetary lens system of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the planetary lensing event has a planetary signal of @xmath102 and the planetary signal can be detected by kmtnet , according to the assumed detection conditions .",
    "moreover , if follow - up spectroscopic observations would be carried out while observing high - magnification events using kmtnet , the chemical information for many faint bulge stars could be obtained , and it would be very helpful in studying the origin of the galactic bulge .",
    "@xcite mentioned that based on detected planetary lensing events , the detection threshold for central caustic events seems higher than for planetary caustic events . to confirm whether this is true or",
    "not , the detection of many more events caused by the central and planetary caustics is needed .",
    "in particular , the detection of more planetary caustic events is needed because only six of 25 microlensing planets have been detected in the planetary caustic events ( beaulieu et al .",
    "2006 ; sumi et al .",
    "2010 ; muraki et al .",
    "2011 ; bennett et al .",
    "2012 ; poleski et al . 2013 ; furusawa et al . 2013 ; tsapras et al . 2013 ) .",
    "fortunately , a vast number of planetary caustic events will be detected by the observation strategy of kmtnet .",
    "in addition , figure 2 shows a total range of central caustic events of @xmath35 that can be detected by kmtnet .",
    "the region includes both ewcp events ( grey region ) and non - ewcp events ( white region marked as @xmath103 ) , which represents events of @xmath104 .",
    "kmtnet can readily detect events within the white region , because it is much easier to detect events of @xmath104 than those of @xmath36 .",
    "a very wide range of grey and white regions implies that a large number of central caustic events ( i.e. , high - magnification events ) will also be detected by kmtnet .",
    "therefore , by using the kmtnet , one can find out whether the detection threshold for high - magnification events is higher than that for planetary caustic events and determine more accurate detection thresholds of both events .",
    "we have estimated the probability of occurring ewcp events of @xmath36 in high - magnification events of @xmath35 and the efficiency of detecting planets in the ewcp events using the next - generation ground - based observation project , kmtnet . from this study",
    ", we found that the ewcp events occur with a frequency of @xmath2 in the case of @xmath3 planets with separations of @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that most of high - magnification events of @xmath35 are ewcp events of @xmath36 , and thus it is important to resolve the ewcp events for the detection of many different planetary systems .",
    "we found that for main - sequence and subgiant stars , @xmath5 planets in ewcp events of @xmath36 can be detected @xmath2 in a certain range that varies depending on the planet mass .",
    "however , it is difficult to detect planets in ewcp events of bright stars like giant stars , because it is easy for kmtnet to be saturated around the peak of the ewcp events with a constant exposure time .",
    "ewcp events are caused by close , intermediate , and wide planetary systems with low - mass planets and close and wide planetary systems with massive planets .",
    "therefore , we expect that a much greater variety of planetary systems than those already detected , which are mostly intermediate planetary systems with @xmath63 regardless of the planet mass , will be significantly detected in the near future .",
