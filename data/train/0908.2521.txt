    "propagating fronts in laplacian growth occur naturally in quite a number of physical problems including viscous fingering  @xcite , electro - chemical growth , dendritic crystal growth for small undercooling  @xcite , and void migration in a conductor  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that this class of problems includes the streamer stage of electric breakdown  @xcite , which will be described below .",
    "a central issue in these problems is the stability of curved fronts . in a limiting case ,",
    "most of these models reduce to the classic saffman - taylor problem  @xcite , which is known to be ill - posed @xcite .",
    "numerical as well as formal asymptotic results  @xcite suggest that one branch of steadily propagating finger or bubble solutions in a hele - shaw cell is stabilized by surface tension regularization , though only recently some mathematically rigorous results  @xcite are available to justify nonlinear stability to small disturbances in the special case of a nearly circular bubble . besides surface tension , other regularizations  @xcite have also been analyzed . in the present paper",
    "we study both the linear and the nonlinear initial value problem for one such regularization , in particular , the stability of a steadily propagating circular shape .",
    "this regularization is called kinetic undercooling in the crystal growth context , but has a different physical interpretation for streamers .    during the streamer stage of electric breakdown",
    "the discharge paves its way through a nonconducting medium , leaving behind a weakly ionized conducting channel .",
    "the basic growth mechanism is impact ionization due to electrons strongly accelerated in the local electric field . in a sufficiently strong field , a thin space charge layer forms around the head of the streamer .",
    "this layer screens the field in the inner ionized region to a very low level , and the growth of the streamer is driven by the electrons moving and multiplying in the strong self - enhanced field ahead of the curved ionization front .    for sufficiently strong external fields ,",
    "the thickness @xmath1 of the electron layer is small compared to the radius @xmath2 of the streamer head .",
    "therefore lozansky and firsov suggested ( mainly in the russian literature , but also in @xcite ) that this layer can be modeled as an interface separating the ionized from the non - ionized region .",
    "probably , the idea is even older , since a similar concept was already proposed by smmer in the german literature in 1933  @xcite .",
    "however , a deeper study of the implications of this concept started only later  @xcite where the problem is placed in the context of other laplacian moving boundary problems .",
    "the validity of the moving boundary approximation for negative streamers is discussed in  @xcite for simple gases like pure nitrogen or argon , and in  @xcite for air . the dimensional analysis and the proposed regularization mechanism of the moving boundary problem for negative streamer ionization fronts",
    "are discussed in detail in our previous papers  @xcite .    in dimensionless form , the model is defined as follows .",
    "the normal velocity @xmath3 of the interface is given by the drift velocity @xmath4 of the electrons , which is proportional to the local electro - static field @xmath5 .",
    "in appropriate units it takes the dimensionless form : @xmath6 where the super - script @xmath7 denotes the limiting value as the interface is approached from the exterior ( the non - ionized region ) and",
    "@xmath8 is the outward normal on the interface . outside the streamer",
    "the electric potential @xmath9 obeys the laplace equation : @xmath10 an analytical and numerical analysis of the underlying physical model formulated in terms of partial differential equations for charge densities and field suggests the interfacial condition @xmath11 where @xmath12 far from the streamer , the electric field tends to a constant to the electric field * e * can occur only if the streamer carries a net electric charge .",

    "a simple solution to the free boundary problem posed by this model takes the form of a uniformly translating circle . our previous work in @xcite and the present paper",
    "are primarily concerned with the linear and nonlinear stability of this solution to small perturbations .",
    "it is to be noted that the circular shape differs from an actual streamer shape .",
    "however , the front half of a circle roughly resembles the shape of the front part of a streamer . since growth of disturbances",
    "is found to be most pronounced in this advancing part of the interface , we expect stability features found here to be qualitatively relevant for an actual streamer and more generally for curved fronts .    in the special case @xmath16",
    ", the linearized evolution of small perturbations can be determined exactly in our model  @xcite .",
    "the case of general @xmath17 is treated in part i  @xcite of this series of papers and in the present manuscript . in  @xcite",
    ", we discussed the spectrum of the linear operator which results from the linear stability analysis of the circular solution . restricting ourselves to an appropriate space of analytic perturbations we found a pure point spectrum .",
    "asymptotically in time , except for the trivial translation mode , all eigenmodes were found to decay exponentially in time .",
    "these eigenmodes are singular at the back of the bubble ; nonetheless , as evidenced in the present paper , this singularity is not reflected by the actual linear evolution near the bubble back .",
    "the usual asymptotic form of the solution for large time : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath20 , fails in a neighborhood of the rear of the bubble , though it holds elsewhere .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the initial value problem .",
    "for the linearized evolution , analytical results are obtained in the limit of strongly localized disturbances of the circle .",
    "also the large time behavior of general perturbations can be studied analytically .",
    "numerical calculations confirm these results .",
    "together with the eigenvalue analysis of the first paper  @xcite , clear evidence of linear stability is presented .",
    "the full nonlinear evolution of a perturbed interface is calculated numerically .",
    "our results suggest that , similar to linear evolution , small enough perturbations of a circular bubble grow in the front part of the bubble , but eventually decay as interfacial distortions advect to the bubble rear . nonetheless ,",
    "when @xmath21 is small but nonzero , the large transients in the linear regime make nonlinearity important even when the initial perturbation is exponentially small in @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , when the perturbations are larger , the circle is no longer an attractor of the dynamics and the propagating structure branches . for general initial shapes , we give some numerical evidence that the undercooling regularization condition can not guarantee a smooth interface globally in time . for some initial conditions ,",
    "the interface tends to develop a sharp corner in the back .",
    "other initial conditions lead to the separation of the moving body into two parts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ equations ]",
    "we present equations derived earlier in a conformal map setting .",
    "section  [ analysis ] is devoted to the linear evolution of perturbations of the circle .",
    "subsection  [ previous results ] recalls previous results , and in subsection  [ stronglyrigor ] we present rigorous results on the growth of a strongly localized perturbation .",
    "we continue the discussion of localized perturbations in subsection [ strongly ] and explain at an intuitive level how strongly localized perturbations are generically advected to the rear of the circle , increasing in amplitude in the front - half before decreasing in the back half .",
    "mathematically , the advection is described by a one - parameter family of conformal maps which is a subgroup of the automorphisms of the unit disk .",
    "the important role of this subgroup has been previously established for the exactly solvable case @xmath22 @xcite . in subsection  [ asymptotic ]",
    "we discuss the anomalous behavior found at the back of the circle in the large time limit . in subsection  [ smoothness ]",
    "we give arguments indicating that an initially analytic interface stays analytic for all finite times , but singularities initially outside the physical region of interest approach the back of the circle for @xmath23 . provided the perturbation for @xmath23 stays analytic in the closed unit disk , except for the point @xmath24",
    ", we in subsection  [ rigorous analysis ] prove that it asymptotically reduces to a constant .",
    "this implies that the perturbation just leads to a shift in space with respect to the unperturbed propagating circle . in subsection",
    "[ numerical ] , we present numerical solutions of the linear evolution equations .",
    "these calculations support the asymptotic results derived in the previous subsections . for disturbances ,",
    "not necessarily localized , we present evidence that on any part of the interface not containing a neighborhood of the bubble rear , the decay rate of the disturbance matches what is expected from the prior spectral analysis @xcite .    section  [ sec : nonlin ] presents a numerical study of the nonlinear evolution for different perturbations .",
    "we first consider perturbations of a circular bubble .",
    "it is shown that the circular bubble can be nonlinearly stable if the perturbation is small . however",
    ", when the perturbation is large enough , the front may start to branch .",
    "furthermore , we study the nonlinear evolution for more general initial configurations .",

    "it is well known that this is a common mechanism for breakdown in the unregularized model , ( @xmath477 ) .",
    "global breakdown has been observed with curvature regularization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and is also observed in our model . figs .",
    "[ fig13n ] and [ fig14n ] show examples , where each figure shows the evolution of a given initial condition for several values of @xmath21 . for @xmath477 cusps",
    "do form , as is particularly obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig14n]a .",
    "the regularization @xmath17 suppresses the cusps , but does not change the tendency to split into two parts .",
    "whether local breakdown by cusp formation can occur in the regularized model , is a more difficult question .",
    "we recall that the neighborhood of @xmath64 shows a special dynamics .",
    "the linearized evolution of the interface can lead to a very complicated shape near @xmath64 since with increasing time singularities of @xmath500 are gathered in this neighborhood . according to subsect .",
    "[ asymptotic ] these singularities for @xmath501 dominate the local structure of the interface .",
    "we also note that for @xmath502 even the linearized evolution is singular at @xmath64 , where it produces a spike .",
    "it thus is conceivable that the nonlinear evolution yields a cusp or some other type of singularity at @xmath64 .",
    "we studied this problem with the initial condition @xmath503 .",
    "the results of the nonlinear evolution are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15n ] .",
    "clearly the cusps forming for @xmath477 in the front part are suppressed for @xmath17 .",
    "we further observe that for @xmath5041/100 or 1/10 , the curvature near @xmath64 decreases , whereas it increases for @xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath16 a cusp may be formed .",
    "consistent with the eigenvalue analysis presented in @xcite , the results of the present paper strongly suggest that a uniformly translating circle is a linearly stable solution of a laplacian interface model regularized by a kinetic undercooling boundary condition .",
    "furthermore , numerical results of the full nonlinear evolution indicate that the circle has a finite basin of attraction in a space of analytic functions",
    ". an important feature of the stabilizing mechanism is the advection of perturbations towards the back of the circle . except for a small region at the back that asymptotically contracts to a point",
    ", the final relaxation to the circle is exponential .",
    "with decreasing regularization parameter @xmath17 the anomalous behavior at the back is suppressed .",
    "however , perturbations increase as long as they are in the front half of the circle , and this effect is strongly enhanced by lowering @xmath21 . since larger perturbations may lead to branching",
    ", this indicates that the basin of attraction of the circle shrinks exponentially with decreasing @xmath21 .",
    "the interface model considered here is a reduced form of a pde - model describing the streamer stage of electric breakdown in the simplest physically relevant situation .",
    "it ignores the physics inside the streamer and the internal structure of the screening layer ; the layer is approximated by the interface together with the boundary condition ( [ amethyst ] ) which introduces the regularization .",
    "numerical solutions of the pde - model indicate that these approximations for sufficiently strong externally applied fields are justified in the dynamically active front part of the streamer .",
    "the back of the streamer is not represented adequately by the interface model .",
    "however , the evolution of the streamer and in particular stability or instability against branching is determined by the active head region , which corresponds to the front half of the circle in our analysis .",
    "indeed , numerical solutions of the pde - model in two dimensions show a behavior quite similar to the evolution of the front half of weakly disturbed circles in the interface model . after reaching the streamer stage",
    "the streamer head is of nearly circular shape and moves with constant velocity .",
    "it slowly flattens at the tip and branches .",
    "compared to the results of the interface model as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig11n ] , the main difference is a slow increase of the head radius due to weak currents flowing into the head from the interior of the streamer .    in summary , we believe that our results not only are of some interest in the context of interface models but also shed some light on the problem of streamer branching . + * acknowledgements : * s.  tanveer was supported by us national science foundation dms-0807266 and acknowledges hospitality at cwi amsterdam . f.  brau acknowledges a grant of the netherlands organization for scientific research nwo within the fom / ew - program `` dynamics of patterns '' .",
