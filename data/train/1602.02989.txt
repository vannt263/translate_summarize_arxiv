    "the remaining question : _ what happens if @xmath1 is non - connected  ? _ is only relevant for non - reduced plane curve singularities .",
    "this question is related to a recent preprint @xcite . that preprint contains a statement about the so - called bobadilla conjecture in case of plane curves .",
    "the invariant @xmath5 , used by massey @xcite should imply that the singular set of of @xmath4 is a smooth line .    in this short note",
    "we give a short topological proof of a stronger statement .",
    "[ p : main ] if the first betti number of the milnor fibre of a plane curve singularity is zero , then the defining function is equivalent to @xmath0 .",
    "[ c : line ] in the above case the singular set is a smooth line and the system of transversal singularities is trivial .",
    "non - isolated plane curve isolated singularities have been thoroughly studied by rob schrauwen in his dissertation @xcite .",

    "deform the reduced factors @xmath13 into @xmath14 such that the product @xmath15 contains the maximal number of double points .",
    "this is called a network deformation by schrauwen .",
    "the corresponding deformation @xmath16 of @xmath4 near such a point has local equation are of the form @xmath17 ( point of type @xmath18 $ ] ) .",
    "near every branch @xmath19 the milnor fibre is a @xmath20-sheeted covering of the zero - locus , except in the @xmath18$]-points .",

    "we consider first in any dimension @xmath38 with a 1-dimensional singular set , see especially the 1991-paper @xcite for definitions , notations and statements .",
    "we focus on the group @xmath39 which occurs in two exact sequences on p. 468 of @xcite :          here @xmath45 is the disjoint union of the transversal milnor fibres @xmath46 , one for each irreducible branch of the 1-dimensional singular set . was originally denoted by @xmath47 . in the second second sequence a misprint @xmath48 in the third term has been changed to @xmath49 . ]",
    "the second part of @xcite contains an elegant classification of @xmath62 with the help of the acampo trace formula .",
    "also the reduction of the generalized bobadilla conjecture to the ( ireducible ) bobadilla conjecture . as final remark : the great work ( the irreducible case ) has still has to be done ! together with the l - conjecture this seems to be an important question in the theory of hypersurfaces 1-dimensional singular sets ."
