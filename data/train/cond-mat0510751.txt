    "organic field - effect transistors ( ofets ) with high charge - carrier mobilities are essential components for high - speed organic electronic applications .",
    "for this reason , it is of crucial importance to unravel the origin of charge transport in these devices .",
    "several experimental studies have shown that the difference in the charge - carrier transport observed in bulk organic semiconductors and within the quasi - two dimensional channel near the gate - insulator interface in ofets is associated with the effects of disorder and interfacial traps @xcite .",
    "more intriguing is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the strong influence of the dielectric permittivity of the gate - insulator on the charge - carrier mobility in ofets @xcite .",
    "veres et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the case of triarylamine polymer transistors in which measured mobilities well below @xmath1can be unambiguously attributed to hopping between localized states . on the other hand , stassen et al .",
    "@xcite obtained much higher values , from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , in single - crystalline rubrene transistors in which conduction is more intrinsic .",
    "a surprising finding in both cases is the drastic decrease of the mobilities as the dielectric constant of the gate - insulator is increased systematically using different dielectric materials .",
    "such observation in devices governed by vastly different charge - transport mechanisms strongly suggests an effect due to the interactions of the charge carriers with the gate - dielectric .",
    "these interactions can lead to the renormalization of the bare mass of the charge carriers in the conducting channel of ofets , providing an explanation for the observed dielectric effects on the mobility as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present a theoretical calculation of the renormalized band mass of charge carriers in the conducting channel of ofets by looking at two important interactions experienced by charges at the interface of an organic semiconductor with a dielectric material .",
    "the first one , purely electronic in origin , is the image force due to the polarization discontinuity at the gate - dielectric interface .",
    "the second involves the coulomb interaction of the charge carriers with surface polar phonons of the dielectric . to illustrate the basic concepts of our calculations and their general applicability to any organic semiconductor , we choose pentacene as a model system since its lattice structure , bandwidth , polarizabilities , and huang - rys factors are well - known compared with other organic semiconductors .",
    "we find that , in pentacene , the cumulative effect of the electronic and surface - lattice polaronic interactions is to reduce the effective bandwidth by a factor of two as the relative static dielectric constant of the gate materials is varied from @xmath2 to @xmath4 . within the tight - binding model ,",
    "such a decrease in the transfer integral can be viewed as a concomitant increase in the effective mass by the same factor .",
    "we will suggest that such renormalization of the band properties triggers the effects reported in refs . @xcite .",
    "the non - interacting band properties of a perfect pentacene crystal along all crystallographic directions have been calculated by cheng et al .",
    "for the bare transfer integral , @xmath5 , between molecules along the direction of easy propagation in the @xmath6-plane , they obtain @xmath7 s@xmath8as the characteristic time for in - plane bloch - wave formation .",
    "the corresponding transfer time in the perpendicular @xmath9-axis direction , @xmath10 , is thirty times longer than in the plane .",
    "thus , in the presence of scattering which substantially reduces the bloch - wave lifetime , the carrier motion is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "the above considerations allow for the classification of the various interactions experienced by charge carriers in organic semiconductors . for fast interactions with characteristic times shorter than @xmath11",
    ", the charge can be assumed to be located on a single molecular site . in pentacene , this is the situation encountered during the interaction of the carrier with the electronic polarizability of the medium or in intramolecular charge - transfer as well as the coupling with intramolecular carbon stretching vibrations with frequencies around @xmath12 .",
    "since fast interactions arise prior to the formation of the bloch - wave , they have the effect of dressing the charge with a polarization cloud or a lattice deformation cloud .",
    "slow interactions , on the other hand , have characteristic times much longer than @xmath11 .",
    "they act directly on the bloch - wave or the localized state .",
    "such is the case for interaction of the charge carrier with low - energy intermolecular thermal phonons and librations which , in many cases , can be considered as static with respect to the two - dimensional band motion .",
    "these interactions scatter the bloch - wave or localize the electronic states when the disorder they introduce is large enough .",
    "the interaction of the charge with the surface polar phonons of the gate insulator occurs in the intermediate time scale regime .",
    "an interesting discussion of time scales can also be found in the first chapter of the book by silinsh and pek @xcite .    because they dress the charge with a polarization cloud or lattice deformation , fast processes lead to a renormalization of the bare transfer integrals @xmath5 and @xmath13 and consequently increase the effective mass along all crystal directions .",
    "the case involving electron - phonon interactions has been discussed by several authors , including appel @xcite and davydov @xcite .",
    "the purely electronic effects were treated by three of us in an earlier work @xcite in which we calculated the renormalization effect due to the electronic polarizability in the bulk of the organic semiconductor . in this work",
    ", these calculations will be extended to the situation encountered by carriers at the gate - dielectric interface in ofets .",
    "we shall treat both electronic and lattice effects .",
    "the frhlich surface polaron at the oxide surface was already studied by kirova and bussac @xcite for an isotropic organic crystal .",
    "the entire problem will be revisited here for the two - dimensional layer of the anisotropic crystal .",
    "the slow processes involving low - energy phonons , librations and other quasi - static or static sources of scattering and localization will be discussed and treated elsewhere .",
    "we have to emphasize that , because they are faster than @xmath14 , the polarization processes studied here involve only the high - frequency dielectric response of the materials constituting the interface and not the usual low frequency ( static ) permittivity .    for the sake of clarity and to highlight the important aspects of this work , we summarize the major results of our calculations in the next section .",
    "the details of these calculations will be given in separate appendices .",
    "in rubrene- or acene - based organic field - effect transistors , the interface with the oxide or polymer gate - insulator involves the highly conducting @xmath15-plane of the organic semiconductor .",
    "our calculation of the variation of the effective transfer integral , @xmath16 , for conduction in this plane is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] as a function of the static dielectric constant of the gate - insulator . in the results of fig.[fig:1 ] , the charge - carrier is assumed to be located on the first monolayer close to the gate - interface . in the case where the charge is on the second monolayer , we find that there is basically no effect of the dielectric on the transfer integral which then takes the bulk value .",
    "these results are obtained from the combined effects of four different interactions which have been treated separately according to their time scales from the fastest to the slowest as discussed below .    1 .   _ electronic polarization _ @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamical renormalization of the carrier motion due to electronic polarization is different in the bulk and at the interface . at an interface , an image field",
    "is generated which is attractive when the high - frequency dielectric constant , @xmath18 , of the gate - insulator is greater than that of the organic semiconductor as is the case for oxides , and is repulsive otherwise as in the case of polymers or air - gap insulators .",
    "this image field is typically of the same order of magnitude as the applied gate fields to which it is added or subtracted .",
    "the magnitude of the image potential under usual experimental conditions is displayed in fig.[fig:2 ] as a function of the distance @xmath19 from the interface . at large distances ,",
    "the classical expression for the image field holds and the image potential is written as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the high - frequency dielectric constants of the semiconductor and the gate - insulator , respectively .",
    "however , corrections to this expression associated with lattice effects show up close to the interface . + the increase in the carrier effective mass due to the electronic polarization cloud is slightly different in the bulk or when it crosses the interface .",
    "the details of these calculations are given in appendix [ appen : a ] .",
    "they lead to a renormalized intermolecular charge - transfer integral @xmath23 .",
    "electronic displacement _ @xmath24 .",
    "the strong dependence of the mobility and the effective mass with the dielectric permittivity of the gate - insulator seen in experiments , as well as large corrections to the bulk electronic polarization energy near the interface shown in fig.[fig:2 ] , suggest that the first two monolayers next to the dielectric interface dominate the charge transport particularly in the presence of a significant gate field @xcite . at even higher fields",
    ", one may expect that not only is the charge localized on the first monolayer but its electronic wavefunction is squeezed towards the part of the molecule closer to the insulator .",
    "this displacement of the charge distribution on the molecule is also a fast process , controlled by the transfer integral @xmath25 within the molecule which is more than an order of magnitude larger than @xmath26 .",
    "this fast process decreases further the transfer integral to @xmath27 . the recent semi - empirical quantum - chemistry calculation performed by sancho - garca et al .",
    "@xcite suggests that this effect is completely negligible in pentacene where the charge - carrier distribution remains perfectly centered even at very high fields ( @xmath28 ) . in this case",
    "the final result of our calculation presented in fig . [ fig:1 ] was established in the frame of this hypothesis that we consider as the most reliable at the moment .",
    "nevertheless , in appendix [ appen : b ] another approach is presented which shows that much larger effects would be expected if the charge - carrier distribution on the molecule is allowed to be displaced by values of a few angstroems at high gate fields of @xmath30 .",
    "3 .   _ intramolecular vibrations _ @xmath31 .",
    "intramolecular vibrations close to @xmath12 in pentacene are strongly coupled to the carrier because they change the @xmath32-alternation typical of conjugated molecules .",
    "because these atomic motions are faster than the electronic polaron motion defined by the renormalization transfer integral @xmath27 , they also contribute to a further reduction of @xmath27 by a constant factor of @xmath33 , independent of the distance from the interface as well as the applied field @xmath34 .",
    "appendix [ appen : c ] reviews how this factor is calculated .",
    "4 .   _ frhlich polaron at the oxide surface _ @xmath35 .",
    "oxides are polar materials .",
    "thus , the infrared - active phonon modes which modulate the metal - oxide bonds are strongly coupled to charge carriers sitting at their surface . in aluminum oxide , for instance , the most active mode of this kind is situated at @xmath36@xcite .",
    "this value is of the same order of magnitude as the effective , in - plane , transfer integral renormalized upon corrections due to the above - mentioned interactions .",
    "+ the construction of a lattice deformation cloud in the oxide is the object of appendix [ appen : d ] .",
    "the polarization interaction energy of the charge with this cloud causes further attraction of the charge to the surface and to the subsequent increase of the effective mass .",
    "the calculation is performed in the intermediate coupling regime because here the coupling parameter which controls the process , @xmath37 , defined in appendix [ appen : d ] , is of the order of unity in the first monolayer , and of the order of @xmath38 in the second one .",
    "the total binding energy of the carrier in the presence of a gate - insulator includes both the electronic and surface polaron effects arising from the electronic image force potential and the lattice deformation potential at the interface associated with the above interactions . within a tight - binding model",
    ", these effects are incorporated into a renormalized effective transfer integral @xmath16 given by , @xmath39 table [ tab:3 ] provides a summary of all these factors in the order of increasing time - scale characterizing each interaction .",
    "the experimental results have clearly shown that the mobilities obtained in organic field - effect transistors are much larger in devices built with an air - gap or a polymer gate - insulator @xcite than those using high - permittivity oxide gate dielectrics .",
    "our theoretical results discussed above provide some insight into the origin of these effects .",
    "given that the bandwidth is four times the transfer integral as suggested in the quantum chemistry calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite and starting from a value of @xmath40@xcite , the effective bandwidth becomes @xmath41@xcite .",
    "it is reduced to @xmath42 in an ofet with an aluminum oxide gate insulator @xmath43 , to @xmath44 close to a @xmath45 interface and @xmath46 close to a @xmath47 interface , while the bulk value of @xmath48 is recovered close to a parylene gate insulator .    for a given disorder potential in the organic semiconductor ,",
    "localization effects roughly scale with the reciprocal bandwidth .",
    "consequently , important bandwidth reductions enhance all localization effects and consequently decrease the mobility .",
    "it is important to note that in the present work the existence of a lattice polaron in the bulk of pentacene was considered as unlikely .",
    "intramolecular vibrations are too fast to produce a polaron in a perfect pentacene crystal and their effect has been studied in appendix [ appen : c ] .",
    "intermolecular phonons and librations with energies @xmath49 of the order of @xmath50 are not coupled enough to the carrier to produce a well - defined lattice polaron , with a renormalized transfer integral of the order of @xmath51 originating from the initial calculation of cheng et al .",
    "however , when the transfer integral experiences a further reduction close to the gate interface as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , then the intrinsic lattice polaron can be excited , as suggested in a recent work @xcite .",
    "a calculation is in progress to clarify this point .",
    "moreover , an interface is rarely perfect from a structural point of view , and the fact that , due to significant internal field present at the interface , the carrier is constrained to probe more closely all the interface disorder , enhancing the localization effects .",
    "even `` perfect '' interfaces can be `` intrinsic '' sources of localization . in general , the electric dipole lattice induced by a charge carrier in the organic semiconductor is incommensurate with the dipole lattice induced in the gate material . in a perfect structure ,",
    "the incommensurability of the electronic potential can open gaps in the semiconductor density of states .",
    "when the gate dielectric is not a single - crystal but a disordered structure , the same effect creates an electronic disorder which can be one of the sources of localization .",
    "the effective bandwidth enters the mobility law but does not define it entirely . in disordered polymer channels , veres et al . @xcite",
    "have established a link between the effective width of the gaussian distribution of electronic states and the mobility of the carrier which jumps from state to state according to the gaussian disorder model @xcite . in more ordered systems such as single - crystalline rubrene ofets ,",
    "a theoretical work is in progress to establish a quantitative link between the transfer integral and the mobility .",
    "it will elucidate the role of thermal , low - energy phonons which are , on the one side , sources of localization and on the other the key to the adiabatic diffusion of the carriers in the channel .",
    "the authors acknowledge the financial support of the swiss federal science foundation under contract number 200020 - 105156 .",
    "the electronic polarization of a molecular crystal , @xmath52 the formation of induced dipoles @xmath53 on the neutral molecules of the crystal in the field of an extra - charge , occurs on a time scale of @xmath54 s @xmath55 .",
    "this is much faster than the carrier lifetime on a molecule which is typically @xmath56 s with @xmath57 allowing one to treat the carrier as stationary on a molecular site during the polarization process .      with the above approximation",
    ", we have calculated the polarization energy of a point - charge in bulk pentacene crystal to be @xmath58 @xcite using the method of self - consistent polarization field to the dipolar approximation @xcite .",
    "the pentacene crystal structure and parameters are given in tab.[tab : param ] .",
    "the molecules involved in the discrete calculation are assumed to be inside a spherical cluster of radius @xmath59 .",
    "the polarization energy varies linearly with the inverse radius of the cluster .",
    "the polarizabilities of the molecules along the @xmath60-directions were adjusted so that the polarization energy at large @xmath61 matches the continuum limit @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the effective dielectric constant in an anisotropic structure @xcite .",
    "the convergence is fast and the calculated polarization energies for anthracene , @xmath64 , and pentacene , @xmath65 , are in good agreement with recently reported values @xcite .    as the charge carrier moves from one molecule to another ,",
    "the polarization energy changes .",
    "in fact , when the electronic polarization energy and the induced - dipole distribution vary from site @xmath66 to site @xmath67 due to different local crystal environment , the carrier will encounter a resistance to its motion .",
    "this leads to a renormalization of the bare transfer integral @xmath5 .",
    "we introduced the parameter @xmath68@xcite as a way of describing quantitatively the polarizability effect on the transfer integral , @xmath52 @xmath69 .",
    "the quantity @xmath70 is closely related to the relative amplitudes and directions of the induced dipoles and is given through the relations @xcite , @xmath71where @xmath72 are the components of the polarizability , and @xmath73 , of the order of one electron - volt , is the energy difference between the ground state and the first - excited state of the neutral molecule @xcite .",
    "the sites considered here , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are the next - nearest neighbor along the crystal direction @xmath74 .",
    "we now extend the above calculation to the case of charge carrier near the interface of pentacene with the dielectric insulator . in this case",
    ", the polarization cloud extends partly into the semiconductor and partly into the dielectric . for simplicity , we modelled the dielectric insulator as a cubic lattice .",
    "the clausius - mosotti relation is then applied to obtain the electronic polarizability of the molecules of the dielectric assuming a given high frequency permittivity , @xmath75here @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the molar mass and the density of the dielectric and @xmath78 is the avogadro number .",
    "the summation in eq.[eqa : a1 ] is then extended to include the induced dipoles in the semiconductor and the dielectric . for reasons of symmetry",
    ", the molecules involved in the discrete calculations are taken inside a cylindrical cluster on both sides of the interface . beyond the cluster approximation",
    ", a continuum contribution is added to the polarization energy using standard electrostatics jackson99 .",
    "the polarization energy as a function of the distance from the interface is shown in fig.[fig:2 ] for both the discrete and the continuous limits .",
    "the self - trapping interfacial polarization electric field ( see appendix appen : a ) and the applied gate - field localize the excess charge on the pentacene molecule by pulling and squeezing the wavefunction towards or away from the interface depending on the relative magnitudes of the dielectric constants of pentacene and the gate - insulator . to get the average position and the spatial extent of the wavefunction of the excess charge , we used a model in which the pentacene molecule is considered as a pair of conjugated chains of eleven sites , each separated by a distance @xmath79 that we treat in the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the basis wavefunction on each site , @xmath80 with @xmath81 satisfies the following set of equations , @xmath82with the boundary conditions @xmath83 imposed at the two ends of the pentacene molecule . here",
    "@xmath84 is the image force potential , @xmath85 is the applied gate - field , and @xmath86 is the intramolecular transfer integral . upon solving this system of equations ,",
    "we obtain the groundstate wavefunction as , @xmath87the spatial dependence of the average position of the excess charge on the chain will be given by , @xmath88    since the pentacene molecule is nearly perpendicular to the interface , the presence of interfacial fields localizes the charge at the extremity of the molecule .",
    "this has the effect of changing the thickness of the channel and , as a consequence , the bandwidth for charge propagation .",
    "indeed , the transfer integral in acene crystals increases with the number of aromatic rings from naphtalene to pentacene @xcite .",
    "this can be related to the spatial extent of the excess charge on the acene molecule .",
    "the charge extent @xmath89 is defined as the width containing @xmath90 of the charge density .",
    "we have chosen as in appendix [ appen : a ] the direction of higher transfer integral which determines the bandwidth .",
    "therefore , the variation of the charge extension under the effect of the image force and the gate - field , will induce a corresponding change in the transfer integral of the pentacene molecules as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for the calculation of the excess charge extension in the above model",
    ", the intramolecular transfer integral @xmath86 was set to @xmath2ev .",
    "the values of the gate and image force fields are those found in appendix [ appen : a ] . however , a semi - empirical quantum chemistry calculation published recently @xcite has shown that , probably due to exchange interactions between the carrier and the @xmath91-electrons in the pentacene molecule , the extra - charge distribution is not pulled and squeezed in the direction of the interface field by the extent predicted by the above model .",
    "thus in the final result of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] this effect has not been included .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows what would the final result be in the case where the squeezing calculated above in this appendix would indeed be effective .",
    "we now refer to the strong coupling of the extra charge to the intramolecular vibrations at @xmath12 in pentacene .",
    "the coupling constant has been determined in acenes both experimentally and theoretically in ref .",
    "the calculation of the band narrowing due to phonons has been presented by several authors @xcite . here",
    ", we present a simplified version for dispersionless intramolecular vibrations .    the electron - phonon hamiltonian of interest is written as , @xmath92 where @xmath66 represents the molecular sites ; @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are the electron and phonon operators respectively .",
    "@xmath97 is the usual coupling parameter . since the phonon frequency @xmath98 is larger than the transfer integral @xmath27 , we look for a variational solution of the hamiltonian .",
    "the trial wavefunction is of the form , @xmath99 where latexmath:[\\[|\\chi _ { n}\\rangle = \\exp \\left ( x_{n}^{\\ast } b_{n}-x_{n}b_{n}^{+}\\right )    @xmath66 on which the charge is located .",
    "the variationnal parameter @xmath101 is determined by minimizing the energy @xmath102 then @xmath103 and the corresponding transfer integral , @xmath104 when thermal phonons are taken into account the thermal average value of the energy yields a temperature correction factor in the transfer integral given by , @xmath105 in the present case , the temperature effect is completely negligible and the electron - phonon binding energy is just @xmath106 per molecular site .    taking the values in bulk pentacene from ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath107 , we obtain @xmath108 .",
    "close to the interface the band narrowing due to intramolecular vibrations is rather insensitive to the interfacial field .",
    "this is related to the fact that the phonon frequency and coupling constants are approximately the same in the acene series @xcite .",
    "when a charge carrier is generated by the field effect at the interface between a molecular semiconductor and a gate insulator , it interacts with the surface phonons of the dielectric .",
    "this effect has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for an isotropic 3d molecular crystal in the adiabatic limit . here",
    ", we consider this interaction in the case of a pentacene crystal where the carrier motion is essentially two - dimensional and for moderate electron - phonon coupling . indeed , the residence time in a monolayer @xmath109 , with @xmath110 is much larger than the time to polarize the dielectric given by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 in @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "however , the phonon frequency @xmath114 is of the same order of magnitude as the effective in - plane transfer integral @xmath115 .",
