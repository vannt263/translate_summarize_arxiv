    ", extrapolated perturbative results do not yield appropriate approximations .",
    "so , e.g. , the perturbative series of the deconfined qcd thermodynamical potential @xmath1 , which is known up to the order @xmath2 @xcite , shows even for moderate values of the coupling , say @xmath3 , a strongly fluctuating behavior increasing with the order of the expansion , whereas lattice gauge simulations @xcite exhibit a rather smooth dependency @xmath4 .",
    "this feature can be understood qualitatively by the asymptotic expansions @xmath5 of the function @xmath6 .",
    "this simple example @xcite mimics the perturbative and full representation , respectively , of the partition function of an interacting field theory in zero dimension .",
    "( in fact , the coefficients @xmath7 count the number of diagrams contributing to the thermodynamical potential of the scalar @xmath0 theory considered below . )",
    "although @xmath8 defined for complex @xmath9 possesses a cut along the negative axis ( thus the series expansion is divergent ) , @xmath10 still contains useful information as to be expected for perturbative results .",
    "the error of the approximation can easily be estimated to be @xmath11 , hence the optimal order to truncate the series expansion is @xmath12 .",
    "these considerations generalized suggest that for the ( at least qualitative ) description of strongly coupled systems suitable lower - order perturbative approximations might be more appropriate than elaborated high - order calculations . for the qcd thermodynamical potential , this _ leading - order conjecture _",
    "is also supported by the argument of minimal renormalization scale dependence of the truncated perturbative expansion . with this assumption for the regime of larger coupling strength , in section [",
    "s : phi4 ] the thermodynamical potential of the scalar @xmath0 theory is calculated in a selfconsistent nonperturbative approximation @xcite . the emerging picture motivates a quasiparticle description of the thermodynamics of gauge systems as discussed in section [ s : qcd ] .",
    "the model is compared to available lattice data , and a prediction of the equation of state of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) including strange flavor is given .",
    "it is well known that the ( naive ) perturbative calculation of the thermodynamical potential @xmath1 of the massless scalar theory with the bare lagrangian = 12 ( _ ) ( ^ ) - ^4 is plagued with infrared divergencies @xcite .",
    "these thermal divergencies can formally be treated by suitably rearranging the lagrangian , e.g.  by adding and subtracting a mass term to @xmath13 , yielding an equivalent theory with free massive propagators and an additional 2-point interaction .",
    "with such a reorganization of the perturbation theory , the expansion of @xmath1 in the coupling strength , then well - defined up to 5th order , has been calculated @xcite . however",
    ", this series expansion exhibits a similar bad convergence as that of the qcd thermodynamical potential when being extrapolated to larger values of the coupling . as an alternative way to the perturbative expansion around the ( modified ) interaction - free limit ,",
    "the luttinger - ward approach , originally derived for nonrelativistic fermion systems @xcite but readily generalized @xcite , is proposed here . formulated in terms of full propagators",
    ", this formalism appears to be a more adequate description than perturbative calculations using free green s functions . in the tadpole approximation considered below it leads to propagators with a mass - like selfenergy providing thus a less formal motivation of the perturbative reorganization technique .",

    "the sum - integral notation is specified below . the expression ( [ lw ] ) obeys the fundamental condition @xcite = 0 [ stat ] which functionally relates microscopic properties ( @xmath15 ) to macroscopic quantities ( @xmath1 ) ensuring thermodynamical selfconsistency .",

    "as to be expected for a consistent approximation , the divergent and renormalization scale dependent terms from the sum - integrals exactly cancel each other in @xmath48 . in analogy to the approximation @xmath25 of the selfenergy ,",
    "@xmath48 sums up all perturbative super daisy diagrams of the thermodynamical potential .",
    "it is emphasized that in equation ( [ omega1 ] ) the first contribution is the thermodynamical potential of an ideal gas of quasiparticles with mass @xmath49 as determined by the gap equation ( [ m^2 ] ) .",
    "the remaining interaction contribution , when calculating the entropy @xmath50 , compensates the temperature derivative terms of the quasiparticle mass .",
    "thus , according to ( [ stat ] ) , @xmath51 is given by the entropy of the ideal massive gas .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows the pressure @xmath52 as a function of the coupling strength . in the range of the coupling considered ,",
    "the positive interaction pressure turns out to be a correction to the ideal gas contribution @xmath53 at the 10% level .    for large values of @xmath37 the pressure @xmath54 does not deviate as much from the free limit as the naive extrapolation of perturbative results might indicate .",
    "this general feature is confirmed by other nonperturbative approaches .",
    "so the approximation @xmath48 agrees with the result @xcite derived by considering the o(@xmath55 ) scalar theory in the limit @xmath56 . without an expansion in @xmath37 , the reorganized ( screened ) perturbation theory @xcite , where a gap equation has to be taken as an ` external information ' , leads to similar results .",
    "compared to these approaches , the luttinger - ward _ ansatz _ is favored here because , by construction , it yields symmetry conserving approximations .",
    "furthermore , expressing the thermodynamical potential in terms of full propagators , the formulation ( [ lw ] ) presumably guarantees a well - organized asymptotic expansion @xcite .",
    "finally , it is at least conceptionally straightforward to extend the selfconsistent resummation scheme to the next - to leading order where the functional @xmath18 is approximated by @xmath57 due to the rising sun contribution    ( 18,7 ) ( 9,2 ) ( 9,2 ) ( 5,1.75)(0,0.5)2(1,0)8 ( 5,2)(-1,-1)4 ( 13,2)(1,-1)4    ' '' ''    the selfenergy then becomes momentum dependent and complex thus the quasiparticles acquire a finite spectral width , a fact which requires more sophisticated techniques as those utilized here .",
    "in qcd the difficulties mentioned at the end of the last section arise already at the 1-loop level . therefore , in the following a more phenomenological approach , though closely related to the luttinger - ward formalism , is applied to describe the strongly coupled qgp .",
    "temperatures closely above the confinement temperature @xmath58 200mev , as they are possibly attainable in heavy - ion collisions , thereby require the appropriate treatment of the strange flavor . with a mass @xmath59 150mev",
    "the strange quarks represent a relevant non - light degree of freedom while the heavier flavors are suppressed .",
    "the plasma is characterized by broken lorentz symmetry which leads to additional partonic excitations not existent in the vacuum .",
    "the effect of the symmetry breaking is yet marginal for excitations with momentum @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the hard ` medium - bound ' ( longitudinal gluonic and helicity - flipped fermionic ) modes are essentially not populated while the persisting excitations bear resemblance to the physical vacuum states .",

    "equations ( [ m_eff ] ) - ( [ g2 ] ) constitute the effective quasiparticle model which selfconsistently ` continues ' the leading order perturbative qcd thermodynamics . corroborating the leading - order conjecture",
