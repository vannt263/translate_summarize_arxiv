    "the very high resolution and signal - to - noise ratio reached in the last decades by different survey projects ( het / hrs , keck / hires , magellan / mike , subaru / hds , and vlt / uves ) allowed the discovery of several chemically peculiar objects .",
    "+ known metal - poor stars are classified in several groups , following their chemical peculiarities ( beers _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; aoki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "about 10% of halo stars show an enhanced carbon abundance ( carbon enhanced metal - poor , cemp ) ; this fraction increases up to @xmath030% by decreasing metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath23 ) . for metallicities lower than [ fe / h ]",

    "cemp stars are distinguished in four subclasses based on the degree of enhancement detected among neutron capture elements : cemp - s ( s - process enriched ; [ ba / fe ] @xmath3 1 and [ ba / eu ] @xmath3 0.5 ) , cemp - s / r ( s- and r - process enriched ; [ ba / fe ] @xmath3 1 and 0 @xmath1 [ ba / eu ] @xmath1 0.5 ) , cemp - r ( r - process enriched ; [ eu / fe ] @xmath3 0.3 and [ ba / eu ] @xmath1 0 ) , cemp - no ( with sub - solar s - process abundances ; [ eu , ba / fe ] @xmath1 0 ) , and cemp-@xmath4 stars ( with a large excess of c , n , o and @xmath4-elements ) . note that most of the metal - poor r - rich stars known are not carbon enhanced and are classified as r - ii ( with [ eu / fe ] @xmath5 1 ) or r - i ( 0.3 @xmath6 [ eu / fe ] @xmath6 1 ) .",
    "about 80% of cemp stars are cemp - s , and about half of cemp - s with measured eu are also r - rich ( cemp - s / r ) .",
    "we focus our analysis on these two last classes of stars .",
    "+ the s - process mainly occurs in stars of low initial mass ( @xmath7 @xmath0 1  3 @xmath8 ) during their thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase ( tp - agb ) , at rather low neutron densities ( @xmath9 @xmath010@xmath10 neutrons/@xmath11 ) .",
    "the major neutron source of the s - process in agbs is the @xmath12c(@xmath4 , n)@xmath13o reaction , which burns radiatively ( at t @xmath0 0.9@xmath1410@xmath15 k ) in a thin layer at the top of the he - intershell ( called @xmath12c - pocket ) during the interpulse periods . a second neutron source is marginally activated during the convective thermal pulses ( t @xmath3 2.5@xmath1410@xmath15 k ) , mainly affecting isotopes close to the branching points .",
    "an additional s - process component comes from massive stars during core he and shell c burning ( @xmath9 @xmath010@xmath16 neutrons/@xmath11 ) and contributes to neutron capture isotopes up to a @xmath0 90 .",

    "( @xcite ) , their surface composition has to be modified by accretion of material from one ( or more ) companion(s ) .",
    "+ large uncertainties still affect agb models and s - process nucleosynthesis , as the evaluation of the mass - loss , the efficiency of the third dredge - up ( tdu , a mixing episode that permits partial mixing processes between material of the he - intershell and the convective envelope ) , the formation of the @xmath12c - pocket ( herwig @xcite ; straniero , gallino & cristallo @xcite ) . in case of binary systems ,",
    "the amount of mass accreted and the distance between the two stars also influence the s - enhancement . in this context",

    "+ in addition , the c and s - material observed on the surface is affected by internal mixing occurring during the stellar life : e.g. , radiative acceleration competes with gravitational settling during the lengthy main - sequence phase , while thermohaline instabilities may reach deep layers on a shorter time - scale if not prevented by the other two processes .",

    "present results by bisterzo _",

    "however , the statistic was limited to seventeen main - sequence stars . for stars on the red giant branch , having undergone the first dredge - up episode ( fdu ) , all mixing processes occurred during the main - sequence phase",
    "are erased .",
    "+ as already found for disk stars ( e.g. , post - agb , ba stars ; busso _ et al . _ @xcite ; abia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , for a given metallicity a range of @xmath12c - pocket strengths has been hypothesized to interpret the observations in cemp - s stars . a clear definition of the properties of the mixing processes at radiative / convective interfaces that lead to the formation of the @xmath12c - pocket has not been reached yet .",

    "this translates into different s - process distributions .",
    "cemp - s / r are among the most enigmatic stars because the s- and r- processes are commonly related to different nucleosynthesis environments . ba ( or la ) and eu are adopted as reference elements to investigate the competition between the two processes , given that @xmath080% of solar ba ( or @xmath070% of solar la ) is synthesized by agbs , while @xmath094% of solar eu is produced by the r - process . a pure s - process predicts [ ba , la / eu ] @xmath0 1 , while cemp - s / r show an observed [ ba , la / eu ] ratio down to zero .",

    "we assume that the r - enhancement detected in peculiar stars with very low metallicities may be due to local supernova(e ) explosion(s ) , leading to an r - enrichment of molecular clouds from which cemp - s / r stars may have formed .",
    "the observed cemp - s / r and the more massive agb companion belong to the binary system and have the same initial r - enhancement .",
    "the more massive star is supposed to evolve through the tp - agb phase , synthesizing s - elements and polluting the observed companion through stellar winds .",
    "the choice of the initial r - enhancement ( scaled to eu ) for elements heavier than ba is based on the solar isotopic r - process contributions deduced with the residual method .",

    "despite a few spectroscopic binaries , r - rich objects do not belong to binary systems , suggesting that their r - process enhancement reveals the chemical inhomogeneity of the interstellar medium of the galactic halo ( hansen _ et al . _",
    "possibly , the strong r - enhancement seen in r - ii stars results from the pollution of the pristine molecular cloud by a neighbor supernova ( aoki _ et al . _",

    "( @xcite , and references therein ) , an initial r - enhancement based on the same solar - scaled r - abundances distribution plausibly plausibly explains the r - enrichment in cemp - s / r stars within uncertainties .",

    "five r - i stars have been analyzed at very - high resolution , and the abundance pattern of neutron - capture elements heavier than ba is quite similar to that of the solar r - process component .",
    "their lower eu abundance is likely more difficult to be disentangled from the averaged enrichment seen in the halo ( [ eu / fe ] @xmath0 0.5 ) , which results from a multiplicity of sne events that exploded during the galactic lifetime .",
