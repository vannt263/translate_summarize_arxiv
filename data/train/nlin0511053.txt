    "the growing interest in the study of nonlinear periodic structures is motivated by the fact that novel physical phenomena can be observed due to the interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity  @xcite .",
    "the presence of periodically varying refractive index in the medium results in a bandgap structure of the transmission spectrum .",
    "this subsequently affects the propagation of optical beams , which is determined by the dispersion curves of different transmission bands and forbidden gaps . by engineering a periodic structure ,",
    "it becomes possible to manage the strength and type of wave diffraction  @xcite , and therefore control the self - action of light in nonlinear media  @xcite .",
    "if the refractive index decreases with light intensity due to nonlinear response of the material , the beam normally experiences broadening due to the self - defocusing .",
    "however , in periodic photonic structures , the same type of nonlinearity allows for beam localization , and this effect is analogous to nonlinear self - trapping in discrete systems  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the self - action dynamics of an initially narrow gaussian beam propagating in a nonlinear defocusing medium with periodically modulated refractive index . we demonstrate that there is a sharp transition from self - defocusing to discrete self - trapping when the depth of index modulation ( @xmath1 ) is increased .",
    "we also observe experimentally the formation of a self - trapped state from a single - site excitation in the defocusing regime .",
    "[ sect : discrete ]    nonlinear propagation of light in photonic structures with a periodic modulation of the optical refractive index in one transverse spatial dimension , such as waveguide arrays  @xcite or optically - induced photonic lattices  @xcite , is commonly described by the so - called tight - binding approximation  @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the propagation coordinate , @xmath4 is the mode amplitude in the @xmath5th waveguide [ fig .",

    "( [ eq : discrete ] ) supports the so - called _ unstaggered discrete solitons _",
    "these are strongly localized states where the light is confined to a few waveguides , and the amplitudes of the modes of neighboring waveguides are in - phase .",
    "importantly , defocusing nonlinearity can also support discrete self - trapping of light , but in the form of _ staggered solitons _ when the amplitude of the modes in neighboring waveguides is out of phase  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : discrete ] ) remains unchanged after the transformation : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it follows that the beam dynamics in the framework of eq .",

    "however , in the case of defocusing nonlinearity , the beam dynamics changes dramatically for smaller index contrast . indeed , if the lattice modulation is absent or very weak , the beam will only experience nonlinearly enhanced defocusing instead of self - trapping . in order to study the crossover between beam self - defocusing and discrete",
