    "soon after an electron paramagnetic resonance study of no in 1950 @xcite , the first reports on its rotational spectrum in the ground vibrational state appeared @xcite .",
    "further studies were carried out later on the main isotopolog @xcite , on @xmath5no @xcite , on n@xmath0o @xcite , and even on n@xmath6o and @xmath5n@xmath0o @xcite ; unlabeled atoms refer to @xmath3n and @xmath4o .",

    "nitric oxide is a minor constituent of earth s atmosphere with a prominent role in the catalytic decomposition of ozone in the stratosphere .",
    "however , it is not easily detected in the atmosphere employing rotational sepctroscopy because of its small dipole moment of 0.15872(2 )  d @xcite , high - resolution ir spectroscopy of its fundamental band is commonly used instead .",
    "in fact , we are only aware of one report on microwave observations of atmospheric no @xcite . the nrao 11  m telescope on kitt peak was used to to record the @xmath13 transition of no near 250.8  ghz .",

    "the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , which is currently under construction , will provide not only very high spatial resolution , but also very high sensitivity and spectral resolution , which should facilitate the detection of minor isotopic species of no .",

    "ultimately , the data were also combined with rotational data of other no isotopologs and with heterodyne ir data of the main species for an isotopic invariant fit along with born - oppenheimer breakdown ( bob ) corrections to derive , in turn , predictions of the rotational spectra of no isotopic species for radio astronomy .",

    "this meant in most instances that the parameter was determined with great significance , meaning its uncertainty in the fit was about one fifth of the magnitude of its value or less .",
    "care was also taken to evaluate which parameter reduced the rms error by the greatest amount .    among the available data of one isotopic species and within one vibrational state , we used those , which were most accurate because data with larger uncertainties have considerably lower weights in the fit ; the weight of a datum in the fit scales inversely to the square of the uncertainty . in a few cases , multiple data were used if the uncertainties were similar .",
