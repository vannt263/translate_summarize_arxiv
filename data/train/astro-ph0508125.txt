    "the star j37 [ @xmath2 tyc 445- 1972 - 1 , gsc 00445 - 01972 ] is a remarkable early f - type dwarf member of the hyades - age open cluster ngc6633 ( jeffries 1997 ) .",
    "it demonstrates several chemical peculiarities , including factors of @xmath3 enhancement in fe , ni and li and an under - abundance of carbon ( deliyannis , steinhauer & jeffries 2002  hereafter dsj02 ; laws & gonzalez 2003  hereafter lg03 ) .",
    "dsj02 suggested that radiatively driven diffusion , specifically the models of richer & michaud ( 1993 ) , produce a `` li - peak '' over a narrow range of effective temperatures ( @xmath4k at 800myr ) , caused by the very thin surface convection zone ( scz ) of j37 reaching down to a radiatively supported reservoir of li atoms .",
    "this hypothesis explains some ( but not all ) of the other abundance anomalies , but is contradicted by recent `` turbulent '' diffusion models ( e.g. richer , michaud & turcotte 2000 ) where instead a modest under - abundance of li is predicted .",
    "alternatively , lg03 suggest that accretion of material depleted of elements with low - condensation temperatures into the thin scz can explain the high abundances of more refractory elements like li and fe , whilst simultaneously resulting in little enrichment of volatiles like c and o. a problem here is that c and o may be under - abundant in j37 , perhaps indicating a later role for diffusion processes similar to those in am stars .",
    "the be abundance of j37 would provide an interesting test of these competing hypotheses .",
    "be is the next lightest metal after li , but may behave quite differently in diffusion models due to its differing electronic structure .",
    "the diffusion models predict that at the age and @xmath5 of j37 , an over - abundance of li should be accompanied by an absence of photospheric be .",
    "in contrast , because be has a very high condensation temperature , the accretion of volatile - depleted material would lead to a be enhancement as high or even a little higher than that for li and fe .",
    "this letter presents an analysis of high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra of j37 and three comparison stars in ngc6633 .",
    "we derive be abundances by comparing the spectra with a model synthesis in the region of the beii doublet at 3130.4and 3131.1 .",
    "we also ( re)determine the abundances of several other elements and compare these to the predictions of diffusion and accretion models .",
    ".stellar parameters for j1 , j3 , j16 and j37 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "this letter improves on the work of dsj02 and lg03 in several respects .",
    "the stellar parameter determinations are more secure thanks to ( i ) the use of metallicity insensitive colour indices for the @xmath5 determination ; ( ii ) 34 - 51 fe lines for the metallicity and microturbulence estimates ; ( iii ) a total of 40 - 58 fe lines for the @xmath6 determination from the ionisation balance . the determination of abundance anomalies for j37 with respect to the cluster are improved by the use of 3 cluster comparison stars ( lg03 used only j1 ) ; the addition of be and mn abundances ; a more reliable determination of the c and ca abundances using more spectral features ; and an apparent mistake in the application of nlte o - abundance corrections by lg03 has been rectified .",
    "assuming an initial @xmath0(be)@xmath7 for ngc6633 , then j37 is enhanced in be by @xmath8 dex ( according to our lte analysis ) . likewise , we confirm previous results that li is enhanced by about @xmath9dex ( assuming an initial @xmath0(li)@xmath10 ) , fe by about @xmath11dex ( compared with the average [ fe / h ] of the three comparison stars ) , ti by @xmath12dex , mn by @xmath13dex , and ca by @xmath14dex .",
    "these over - abundances are larger than found by dsj02 and lg03 , because the @xmath5 we have derived is about 500k higher than indicated by the @xmath15 based estimate in dsj02 and 275k hotter than the spectroscopic estimate in lg03 ( about 1 error bar ) . given the abundance anomalies in j37 s atmosphere it would not be surprising if a @xmath16 based on @xmath15 , which is heavily affected by line blanketing , was inaccurate .",
    "the optical / ir indices we have used are much more insensitive to detailed composition .",
    "the large be abundance found for j37 offers no support to the diffusion hypothesis put forward by dsj02 .",
    "the only set of diffusion models that predicted a large li enhancement also predicted that be should be completely depleted from the photosphere ( richer & michaud 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore , the new @xmath5 we have estimated for j37 places it @xmath17k hotter than the predicted position of the li - peak at the age of ngc6633 . the extreme sensitivity of diffusion predictions to details of the atmosphere and atomic physics may mean that future calculations are more successful ; but currently published models fail .",
    "the accretion hypothesis can satisfactorily explain why there are simultaneous increases of be , li and fe but not of c and o. be has a higher condensation temperature than either fe or li ( lodders 2003 ) and should be present at close to its primordial value in any volatile - depleted material that is accreted .",
    "taking fe as the primary compositional tracer and making the simplifying assumptions that accreted material is mixed only within the scz and no diffusion or gravitational settling takes place after accretion , we can estimate the mass of accreted material that would explain the observed abundance . according to the models of richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the @xmath5 of j37 matches that for a star of 1.6@xmath18 at an age of 600myr and such a star would have @xmath19 , in excellent agreement with our spectroscopically determined value .",
    "the mass of the scz in such a star is of order @xmath20 and so the quantity of ( for instance ) solar system ci chondrite meteoritic material ( lodders 2003 ) required for the fe enhancement observed in j37 ( assuming an initial a(fe ) = 7.39@xmath210.06 determined from the comparison stars ) would be just 0.011@xmath22",
    ".    the accretion of this chondritic material would also result in @xmath0(li)@xmath23 and @xmath0(be)@xmath24 ( assuming the initial abundances quoted earlier ) . in both cases",
    "the uncertainty in the initial abundance has little effect on the final abundance and hence it appears that the measured li / fe and be / fe ratios in j37 might be too large to support the accretion hypothesis ( see table  [ tab : libe_abundances ] ) .",
    "recall however that these abundances are calculated assuming lte conditions .",
    "the lii  6708doublet is strongly effected by nlte effects at high abundances as can be seen in carlsson et al .",
    "( 1994 , see their figure 16 ) .",
    "they suggest an nlte correction to the j37 li abundance of @xmath25 dex bringing the li abundance in line with that predicted by meteoritic accretion .",
    "the be abundance may also be effected by atmospheric uncertainties .",
    "detailed nlte calculations at a range of @xmath5 do not yet exist and there is also a strong suggestion ( e.g. see asplund 2004 ) that there is a missing source of continuum opacity at @xmath26 .",
    "given that j37 is significantly hotter than the sun and the ngc6633 comparison stars , these two effects result in additional uncertainty in the differential be abundances , to the extent that detailed agreement with the meteoritic accretion hypothesis should not be excluded .",
    "accretion of volatile - depleted meteoritic material can not explain why the c and o abundances of j37 are _ lower _ than the ngc6633 comparison stars by 0.2 - 0.3dex .",
    "the accretion of 0.011@xmath22 of chondritic material should result in [ c / h ] = @xmath27 and [ o / h ] = @xmath28 ( assuming initial abundances of @xmath290.13 and @xmath300.14 respectively ) , about 0.5dex higher than observed in j37 .",
    "this discrepancy can only be partly resolved by accreting material that is even more depleted in volatiles ( such as `` bulk earth '' material ",
    "see lg03 ) .",
    "it seems likely , as suggested by lg03 , that some diffusion _ has _ occurred in j37 , either before or after the accretion event(s ) .",
    "certainly c and o depletions of order 0.5dex are feasible according to the recent models of richer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and are less severe than the depletions observed in many classic am / fm stars .",
    "however , given that models and also observations of am stars , show simultaneous depletions of similar magnitude for the refractory element ca , accompanied by an enhancement of the iron - peak elements , it seems unlikely that diffusion can have been very effective , because [ ca / fe]@xmath31 for j37 , rather than the more typical @xmath32 seen in am stars .",
    "an area for further study would be to systematically find the frequency of li / be - rich f stars in open clusters , to investigate ( a ) how common the accretion events are and ( b ) how quickly diffusive or other mixing processes can remove the abundance anomalies from the photosphere .",
    "if the frequency is low it would suggest that accretion events are rare or that the effects of diffusion rapidly dilute any accreted material .",
    "if , however , the frequency is high it would suggest accretion is common and diffusion is slow .",
    "it should be noted that the quantities of accreted material discussed in this paper are far too small to explain the enhanced metallicity of exoplanet host stars ( e.g. santos , israelian & mayor 2004 ) , which generally have _ much _ more massive sczs .",
    "we have found that that the li - rich early f dwarf j37 is also be - rich , with @xmath0(be)@xmath1 .",
    "the be over - abundance in j37 ( together with 0.70.9dex enhanced abundances for ca and iron - peak elements ) completely contradict published diffusion models hypothesised to explain the li - rich nature of j37 .",
    "instead , the enhancement of highly refractory elements like be , ca and fe , together with much lower abundances of c and o , can be explained by the accretion of about 0.01@xmath22 of volatile - depleted material such as chondritic meteorites .",
    "however , the @xmath33dex under - abundances of c and o in j37 compared with other stars in the same cluster suggest that there may still be a limited role for diffusion to play .",
    "based on observations collected with the vlt / ut2 kueyen telescope ( paranal observatory , eso , chile , observing runs 071.d-0441 and 266.d-5655 ) .",
