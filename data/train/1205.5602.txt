    "two - way communications , where two nodes exchange messages , were first studied by shannon  @xcite . though this channel is seemingly simple  with only two nodes",
    " the capacity region remains unknown to date , except for a few spacial cases : the gaussian two - way channel  @xcite and the _ restricted _ two - way channel  @xcite .",
    "one variation of the two - way channel is the two - way relay channel  @xcite where the exchange of messages between two users is assisted by a relay , which itself has no message to send .",
    "the two - way relay channel has many applications including satellite communications and cellular mobile communications .",
    "however , the introduction of a relay in the channel further complicates the task of finding its capacity .",

    "this model is also motivated by real - life scenarios where relays are used when inter - user communications are not possible . however , the capacity region of even the restricted and separated two - way relay channel is not known in general  @xcite .",
    "a natural extension of the two - way relay channel is the multi - way relay channel ( mwrc ) where multiple users exchange messages through a relay  @xcite .",
    "apart from theoretical interests , this extension is also motivated by satellite networks and cellular networks with multiple users . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only class of the mwrcs where the capacity has been found is the separated finite - field mwrc  @xcite . for the separated gaussian mwrc",
    ", the capacity has been found for only the symmetrical case  @xcite .    in this paper , the capacity region is found for another class of mwrcs , where ( i ) the uplink and the downlink are separated , ( ii ) the channel is restricted , and ( iii ) the uplink is any _ deterministic _ function ( there is no noise , but signals from different users interfere with each other ) .",
    "for this class of mwrcs , we will show that an optimal scheme is for the relay to directly map its received vector to a codeword to be transmitted .",
    "each user then performs a two - step decoding : it first decodes the received vectors of the relay , and then decodes the messages of all other users .",

    "<S> this paper considers the multi - way relay channel ( mwrc ) where multiple users exchange messages via a single relay . </S>",
    "<S> the capacity region is derived for a special class of mwrcs where ( i ) the uplink and the downlink are separated in the sense that there is no direct user - to - user links , ( ii ) the channel is restricted in the sense that each user s transmitted channel symbols can depend on only its own message , but not on its received channel symbols , and ( iii ) the uplink is any deterministic function . </S>"
