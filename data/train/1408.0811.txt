    "the strong electromagnetic fields accompanying heavy - ions accelerated at the lhc may lead to particle production in ultra - peripheral collisions where there is no overlap between the colliding nuclei .",
    "this has been exploited by the alice collaboration to constrain the nuclear and proton gluon distributions through exclusive photoproduction of j/@xmath1 mesons  @xcite .",
    "this presentation extends these studies to exclusive photoproduction of @xmath2 and @xmath1(2s ) .",
    "it also contains results on two - photon production of @xmath3 pairs in a novel invariant mass range .    during the heavy - ion runs in 2010 and 2011 ,",
    "alice used dedicated triggers for collecting vector mesons produced in ultra - peripheral collisions .",
    "the alice detector and the triggers used during the 2011 run are described in  @xcite .",
    "the midrapidity triggers were based on input from the alice time - of - flight ( tof ) , silicon pixel ( spd ) , and vzero detectors .",
    "at least two hits were required in tof and spd , while the vzero detectors , covering @xmath4 and @xmath5 , were used as veto detectors and were required to be empty . in 2011 , a cut on azimuthal angle was applied which required the hits in tof to be back - to - back , thereby restricting the final states to have invariant masses @xmath6 2 gev / c@xmath7 .",
    "the ultra - peripheral trigger used in 2010 was similar to the one in 2011 but without the angular cut . during the early part of the 2010 run a trigger using input only from the tof was also used .",
    "the integrated luminosities for the analyses presented below were about 260 mb@xmath8 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 pairs , 2010 data ) and 22 @xmath9b@xmath8 ( @xmath1(2s ) , 2011 data ) .",

    "right : the measured @xmath11 for coherent photoproduction of @xmath2 compared with model predictions.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the events used for the analysis were required to satisfy the ultra - peripheral trigger , to have exactly two reconstructed tracks identified as pions from the de / dx in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , and to have a reconstructed primary vertex within @xmath1210  cm from the center of the interaction region along the beam axis . to select coherent production the pair-@xmath13 was required to be @xmath14  gev / c .",
    "the rapidity of the pair was required to be within @xmath15 to avoid edge effects .",
    "the data were corrected for acceptance and efficiency bin - by - bin in invariant mass using simulated events processed through the detector response simulation and reconstructed back using the same selection as for real data .",
    "the simulated events consisted of two pions of opposite charge with a flat distribution in invariant mass ( @xmath16  1.5  gev / c@xmath7 ) , rapidity ( @xmath15 ) , and transverse momentum ( @xmath10  0.15 gev / c ) . the decay angle distribution was not measured . in the simulation , it was , as expected for the decay from a spin-1 state , assumed to be @xmath17 in the @xmath18 center of mass . the systematic error is estimated and includes the errors in signal extraction , track selection , luminosity , trigger efficiency , incoherent contribution , and particle identification .    the corrected invariant mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ( left ) .",
    "the distribution has been fitted to a relativistic breit - wigner function plus a continuum term : @xmath19^{\\frac{3}{2 } } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the amplitudes for the resonant and continuum contributions , respectively . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mass and width of the @xmath2 meson , and @xmath24 is the mass of the pion .",
    "although other parameterizations of the @xmath2 shape are possible , the above is chosen to be consistent with the most recent @xmath2 photoproduction measurements by zeus  @xcite and star  @xcite .",
    "the fit gives @xmath25  mev / c@xmath7 and @xmath26  mev / c@xmath7 , in good agreement with the pdg values .",
    "the ratio of the non - resonant to resonant amplitudes is @xmath27 ( gev / c@xmath7)@xmath28 .",
    "the cross section for coherent @xmath2 production is obtained by integrating the resonant part of the @xmath29 ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ( left ) ) from @xmath30 to 1.5 gev / c@xmath7 .",
    "the contribution from incoherent photoproduction below @xmath10 0.15  gev / c is estimated to be 5% and is subtracted .",
    "the result is @xmath31  mb , which is shown and compared with model predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] ( right ) .",
    "the measured cross section is in agreement with starlight  @xcite and the calculation by goncalves and machado ( gm )  @xcite while the gdl ( glauber - donnachie - landshoff ) prediction  @xcite is about a factor of 2 higher than data .",
    "the calculation by gm is based on the color dipole model , while starlight and gdl use the photon - proton cross section @xmath32 constrained from data as input .",
    "all calculations use the glauber model to scale the cross section from @xmath33-nucleon to @xmath33-nucleus .",
    "the agreement with starlight is a bit surprising since the calculation does not include the elastic part of the total cross section , which is included in the gdl model , but a similar trend was observed by star at rhic  @xcite .",
    "photoproduced @xmath1(2s ) mesons can be studied in the dilepton decay channel using the alice triggers for ultra - peripheral collisions  @xcite .",
    "the trigger at midrapidity is , however , also sensitive to the decay channel @xmath34 , followed by @xmath35 , which has a more advantageous branching ratio of 34% .",
    "these events are characterized by two hard tracks with @xmath36  1  gev / c from the decay of the @xmath0 and two soft tracks with @xmath10  0.4  gev / c from the two pions .",
    "the triggered events were required to have exactly 2 or 4 reconstructed tracks and a reconstructed primary vertex .",
    "the dileptons can be separated into @xmath3 or @xmath37 using the tpc de / dx .",
    "to select coherently produced @xmath1(2s ) a requirement @xmath10  0.15 ( 0.30 ) gev / c was applied for the decay channels containing muons ( electrons ) .",
    "the yield in the direct dilepton channel ( @xmath3 and @xmath37 combined ) was obtained by fitting the invariant mass distribution to the sum of a crystal ball function for the signal and an exponential for the @xmath38 background .",
    "the 4 track samples have a very high purity and the yield is obtained by counting the number of events within selected intervals in phase space determined from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the invariant mass of the dileptons are required to be within @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) gev / c@xmath7 for @xmath37 ( @xmath3 ) to select pairs coming from a @xmath0 decay . the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 )",
    "final state is required to have an invariant mass @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) gev / c@xmath7 to count as a @xmath1(2s ) .",
    "this gives a total of 17 ( 11 ) events for the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) decay channel , with a like - sign background of 1 ( 0 ) event .",
    "the extracted yield is corrected for acceptance and efficiency using starlight events processed through the detector response simulation and reconstructed back using the same selection as for real data .",
    "the cross section is obtained from a weighted mean of the dilepton and 4track decay channels , giving @xmath45  mb .",
    "this is compared to model predictions  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi2sxsection ] .     for coherent @xmath1(2s ) photoproduction compared with model calculations ( starlight  @xcite , an  @xcite , gdgm  @xcite , lm  @xcite ) . ]    the @xmath1(2s ) is a hard probe , the scale being set by its mass , and is therefore expected to be sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution in the same way as the @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental error is , however , larger for the @xmath1(2s ) than for the @xmath0 measurement , mainly because of the limited statistics .",
    "it is also important to note that the underlying @xmath46 cross section has a considerably larger uncertainty for @xmath1(2s ) than for @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated by the large discrepancy between the an  @xcite and starlight predictions without nuclear effects in the figure .",
    "one can nevertheless conclude that the measured cross section disfavors models with no nuclear effects and models with strong gluon shadowing .",
    "two - photon production of @xmath3 pairs has a topology similar to that of exclusive vector mesons production followed by decay into a pair of dileptons or pions .",
    "this process is of interest since the coupling between the photon and the emitting nucleus is enhanced by a factor z ( the nuclear charge ) .",
    "one can therefore expect higher order terms to be important .",
    "the results from alice on @xmath47 from the 2011 pb - pb run were , however , found to be in good agreement with starlight , which includes only the leading order qed terms  @xcite . because of the requirement on azimuthal angle in the trigger , the results from 2011 were restricted to high invariant masses , @xmath48  2.2  gev / c@xmath7 .",

    "the raw data were corrected for acceptance and efficiency using events generated by starlight .",
    "figure  [ fig : gg ] ( left ) shows the @xmath13 distribution of the selected @xmath3 pairs . the distribution is well described by starlight , indicating that there is no background not accounted for in the sample . the measured cross section for the selection @xmath50",

    "the alice collaboration has made the first measurements of coherent @xmath2 and @xmath1(2s ) photoproduction in pb - pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "the measured cross section for the @xmath1(2s ) disfavors models with no nuclear effects and models with strong gluon shadowing .",
    "this is thus consistent with the conclusions from the @xmath0 measurements  @xcite but less strong because of the larger uncertainties for @xmath1(2s ) discussed above .",
    "the results on @xmath2 show that a straightforward scaling of the @xmath33-p cross section using the glauber model  @xcite overpredicts the cross section .",
    "this confirms what was observed in au - au collisions at rhic energies .",
