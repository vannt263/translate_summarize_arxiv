    "multiplicity distributions and total cross sections are the main characteristics of hadrons multiple production at high energies .",

    "they are valence quarks and few gluons which fill in the whole spectrum in rapidity space .",

    "\\3 ) on the third step after interaction the colored hadrons move apart and when the distance between them becomes larger than the confinement radius , the lines of color electric field gather into the string .",
    "this string breaks out into secondary hadrons .    in the model",
    "total cross sections of proton - proton and proton - antiproton collisions are described by the following formulae @xmath0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where first two terms present non vacuum contributions and were taken from the paper by cudell et .",
    "there are also constant term and terms proportional to powers of logarithm of full energy .",
    "constant term corresponds to gluon exchange between initial states containing only valence quarks .",
    "powers of logarithm are equal to number of gluons in initial states of hadrons .",
    "the fitting of formulae  ( [ 1 ] ) to total cross sections of @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions ( fig.1 , data were taken from  @xcite ) showed that there are only two gluons in initial state .",
    "contribution of the third gluon is about 1  mb at energy 14  tev and thus is negligible .",
    "the values of parameters are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .     and @xmath2 collisions in lcnm ]    having limited number of gluons we can describe the types of inelastic processes in proton - proton and proton - antiproton interactions .",
    "from the obtained result of presence of only two gluons in initial state it follows existence of three types of inelastic processes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 collisions .",
    "there are three types of inelastic processes in proton - antiproton interaction .",
    "the first type is production of hadrons shower from decay of gluon string , it corresponds to constant contribution to total cross sections ( fig .",
    "the second type is shower produced from decay of two quark strings , it corresponds to contributions from one and two gluons ( fig .",
    "the third type is shower produced from decay of three quark strings , it corresponds to part of contribution from two gluons ( fig .",

    "interaction in final state is marked by dashed block . ]        at the same time there are only two types of inelastic processes in proton - proton interaction , they are shower from gluon string ( fig .  2d ) and shower from two quark strings ( fig .",
    "there are no three quark strings in @xmath1 interaction because in this case strings can be formed between quark of one proton and diquark of another proton .",
    "we suppose that hadrons multiplicity distribution in gluon string is normal distribution ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "gluon pairs are sequentially produced in final state marked by dashed block .",
    "this production takes place until energy of pairs approaches hadrons mass .",
    "then gluon pairs decays at several observable hadrons .",
    "every diagram of this type gives certain number of secondary hadrons .",
    "number of such diagrams is considerably large .",
    "there is no suppression on energy because exchange is of vector type .",
    "contributions from this diagrams have the same order of magnitude .",
    "so secondary hadrons multiplicity as random variable has to obey normal distribution because of central limit theorem of probability theory .",
    "thus multiplicity distribution in gluon string is normal distribution .",
    "we suppose that hadrons multiplicity distribution in quark string is negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with data on @xmath6 annihilation at low energies where one quark string is produced with assurance .",
    "so multiplicity distribution in two quark strings is convolution of two nbd , namely nbd with double parameters , and in three quark strings it is convolution of three nbd , namely nbd with triple parameters .",
    "experimental charged multiplicities are normalized on non single diffraction cross sections , @xmath7 .",
    "pomeron contributions are the same as for total cross sections @xmath8 here we divided formulae by constant term for convenience .    the fitting of vacuum contributions to non single diffraction cross sections is shown on fig .  4 ,",
    "data were taken from  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath9 to number of degrees of freedom 14 to 8 is caused by difference between data of ua4 and ua5 collaborations .     and",
    "@xmath2 collisions ]    the obtained coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 determine the weights of configurations with gluon string , two quark strings , three quark strings .",

    "@xmath12    weights of double nbd are different for @xmath1  ( [ 4 ] ) and @xmath2  ( [ 5 ] ) interactions because in case of proton - antiproton configuration with two gluons also gives contribution to three quark strings .",
