    "let @xmath0 be a closed surface of genus @xmath1 and let @xmath2 be the riemannian metric on @xmath0 . denote by @xmath3 the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath0 , and by @xmath4 the smallest positive eigenvalue of the laplacian . let the area @xmath5 be fixed .",
    "how large can @xmath4 be on such a surface ?",
    "sharp bounds for the first eigenvalue are known only for the sphere ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , the projective plane ( @xcite ) , the torus ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and the klein bottle ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the surface of genus @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath0 be orientable and let @xmath7 be a non - constant holomorphic map ( or , conformal branched covering ) of degree @xmath8 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that @xmath9 any riemann surface of genus @xmath1 can be represented as a branched cover over @xmath10 of degree @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 $ ] denotes the integer part ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "let @xmath15 be a surface of genus @xmath16",
    ". then implies @xmath17 the aim of this paper is to show , using a mixture of analytic and numerical tools , that ( [ sharp ] ) is sharp .",
    "main results of this paper were announced ( without proofs ) in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be a branched covering of degree @xmath19 .",
    "the riemann - hurwitz formula ( see @xcite ) implies that this cover is ramified at @xmath20 points .",
    "we choose these points to be the intersections of the round sphere @xmath21 centered at the origin with the coordinate axes in @xmath22 .",
    "the surface @xmath23 can be realized as @xmath24 this surface has the conformal structure of the bolza surface .",
    "it has an octahedral group of holomorphic automorphisms and its symmetry group is the largest among surfaces of genus two @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the bolza surface appears in some other extremal problems , in particular for systoles ( see @xcite ) .    to simplify calculations",
    "it is convenient to rotate the equatorial plane by @xmath25 .",
    "the equation of @xmath23 becomes @xmath26 the projection @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 .",
    "the set of ramification points in the complex @xmath29 plane is @xmath30 .",
    "the spherical and complex models are related by the stereographic projection ; the induced metric in the complex plane ( which we assume coincides with the equatorial plane of @xmath21 ) is @xmath31    let @xmath32 be the metric on @xmath23 which is the pullback of the round metric on @xmath21 .",
    "one can see that the metric @xmath32 has conical singularities at the points of ramification .",
    "it has curvature @xmath33 everywhere except the branching points . because of the presence of singularities we have to specify what we mean by the first positive eigenvalue of the laplacian on @xmath34 .",
    "we set @xmath35 where the scalar product @xmath36 and the norm @xmath37 are taken in the space @xmath38 .",
    "the sobolev space @xmath39 of functions supported away from the singularities is obtained by the closure of @xmath40 with respect to the norm @xmath41 .",
    "we start with the following    [ conj1 ] the equality in is attained for the metric @xmath32 on @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath42    since @xmath34 is a double cover of the standard @xmath21 , we have @xmath43 therefore , in order to prove conjecture  [ conj1 ] it suffices to show that @xmath44    unfortunately , we are unable to prove , and therefore establish conjecture  [ conj1 ] .",
    "we can however reduce the conjecture to the following spectral problem on a quarter - sphere @xmath45 that can be treated using numerical methods .",
    "namely , let , in usual spherical coordinates @xmath46 , @xmath47 we split the boundary @xmath48 into two parts : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 @xmath51 and consider the spectral boundary value problem for the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath52 : @xmath53    let @xmath54 denote the first eigenvalue of the problem ( which we understand as usual in the variational sense ) .",
    "[ conj2 ] @xmath55    our main result is    [ conj2to1 ] conjecture [ conj2 ] implies conjecture [ conj1 ] .",
    "theorem [ conj2to1 ] is proved in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "extensive numerical calculations ( see section [ sec : num ] ) show that @xmath56 which implies conjecture [ conj1 ] .",
    "the best lower bound we are able to prove is just @xmath57 , which follows from dirichlet - neumann bracketing ( replace the dirichlet condition by the neumann one on the arc @xmath58 , @xmath59 , see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that the spectral problem easily reduces via the stereographic projection to the following mixed dirichlet - neumann problem on a half - disk @xmath60 ( here @xmath61 are usual planar polar coordinates ) : @xmath62 here @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "problems and are quite remarkable in their own right  each of them is an example of a mixed dirichlet - neumann boundary value problem whose spectrum is invariant under a swap of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "namely , the spectrum of coincides with the spectrum of @xmath65 we refer to @xcite for a further discussion on dirichlet - neumann swap isospectrality .",
    "one can check that a surface with a finite number of conical singularities can be approximated by a sequence of smooth surfaces of the same genus and area in such a way that the corresponding sequence of the first non - zero eigenvalues converges to @xmath4 on the original surface .",
    "thus , conjecture  [ conj1 ] means that is sharp in the class of smooth metrics , although the equality is not necessarily attained . for a general result about the convergence of the whole spectrum see @xcite",
    "let @xmath66 , @xmath67 be a map that intertwines the preimages of points of @xmath21 under a two - sheeted covering @xmath18 .",
    "clearly , the laplace operator @xmath3 commutes with @xmath68 .    by the spectral theorem",
    ", we can consider separately the restrictions of the laplacian onto the spaces of functions which are either even or odd with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "the even functions on @xmath23 can be identified with the functions on @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , as @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 , and the equality in will be achieved if and only if the first eigenvalue @xmath71 of the laplacian acting on the odd subspace satisfies @xmath72 .",
    "consider the following isometries of @xmath21 ( as usual , we identify @xmath21 and @xmath73 by stereographic projection ) : @xmath74 here @xmath75 is a point in the equatorial plane upon which a point @xmath76 is stereographically projected .",
    "the hyperelliptic involution @xmath68 is given by @xmath77 .",
    "for @xmath78 , a symmetry @xmath79 of @xmath21 has two corresponding symmetries @xmath80 and @xmath81 satisfying @xmath82 those symmetries , with account of are given by the explicit formulae @xmath83 as an illustration , we demonstrate how the last of these formulae is obtained : if @xmath84 , then by , @xmath85 thus giving the expression for @xmath86 .",
    "it easily seen that all @xmath80 commute with @xmath68 and satisfy @xmath87    in the proof of theorem [ conj2to1 ] we will use only the symmetries @xmath88 and @xmath86 .",
    "calculations for @xmath89 are presented for the sake of completeness ( see remark [ rems2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath90 denote a fixed point set of a mapping @xmath91 .",
    "as easily seen from , the sets @xmath92 , for @xmath93 , lie in the union of the coordinate lines and a unit circle of @xmath73 , and we introduce the following notation for future reference .",
    "the coordinate lines are divided into two rays each by the ramification point @xmath94 , and we denote @xmath95 @xmath96 the circle is divided into four arcs by the ramification points @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , and we denote the arcs by @xmath101 so that the arc @xmath102 goes from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , the arc @xmath105 goes from @xmath104 to @xmath106 , the arc @xmath107 goes from @xmath106 to @xmath108 , and finally @xmath109 goes from @xmath108 to @xmath103 .    in this notation , the fixed point sets @xmath92 are written as @xmath110    note that each of the rays @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) intersects an arc @xmath113 at a single point which we denote @xmath114 : @xmath115 see figure [ fig : points ] .",
    "each of the points @xmath114 has exactly two pre - images @xmath117 , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 are the solutions of the equation @xmath120 , with @xmath121 given in .",
    "these solutions are easily found from ; we are of course at liberty to choose which of the two solutions is denoted @xmath122 and which is denoted @xmath123 .",
    "for definiteness we set @xmath124    for future use , we need to know the images of points @xmath125 under the symmetries @xmath126 , @xmath127 . these are easily calculated from ; it turns out that @xmath128 with some indices @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "the results of the calculations are summarized in the following table  [ tab : ws_and_ss ] .",
    ".the points @xmath125 and their images @xmath131 under symmetries @xmath126 .",
    "the table lists the pairs of indices @xmath132 and the resulting pairs @xmath133 for @xmath127 .",
    "note also that @xmath68 acts by interchanging the second indices @xmath134.[tab : ws_and_ss ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in each of the experiments above , we found that the computed eigenvalues appeared to converge to a value greater than 2.27 .",
