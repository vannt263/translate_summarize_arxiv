    "one of the important problems in hadron physics is to understand the structure of the nucleon within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . because the nucleon is a composite particle , its properties are closely related to the spectrum and the structure of its excited states . from the available data , we know that all of the excited nucleon states ( denoted collectively as @xmath15 ) are unstable and couple strongly with the meson - baryon continuum states to form resonances in @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions .",
    "therefore , the study of the @xmath15 resonances in @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions has been a well - recognized important task in advancing our understanding of the structure of baryons .",
    "it can also provide important information for understanding how the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking emerge from qcd .    in this work",
    ", we report on the results from an investigation of @xmath15 resonances with an extension of the dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model developed in ref .",
    "schematically , the following coupled - channels integral equations in each partial wave are solved within the dcc model of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath8 that has the unstable @xmath28 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 components , @xmath29 is the green s function of the channel @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the mass of a bare excited nucleon state @xmath15 , @xmath32 is defined by the meson - exchange mechanisms , and the vertex interaction @xmath33 defines the @xmath34 transition .",
    "we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : dcc ] how eqs .",
    "( [ eq : teq ] ) and  ( [ eq : veq ] ) can be cast into a form that is most convenient for extracting the nucleon resonances from the amplitude @xmath35 . in the past few years , we have applied this dcc model to analyze @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions with @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath5  @xcite , and @xmath8  @xcite final states . the method for extracting the nucleon resonances within the considered dcc model was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite with the results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . during this developing stage ,",
    "the dcc model parameters were not determined by _ simultaneous _ fits to all of the considered data .",
    "in addition , the very extensive data of @xmath6 and @xmath7 photoproduction reactions were not included in the analysis . as a step in improving our analysis",
    ", we have extended these earlier efforts to perform a _ combined _ analysis of the available data for @xmath36 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report on the results from this effort .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is to extend the model , defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : teq ] ) and  ( [ eq : veq ] ) , to include the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels .",
    "we then apply the same numerical procedures detailed in our previous publications  @xcite to perform the calculations .",
    "our main effort is to determine the parameters of the interactions @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : veq ] ) by fitting simultaneously all of the rather extensive data , as explained later .",
    "the nucleon resonances are then extracted from the resulting model by using the analytic continuation method developed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the extraction of nucleon resonances has a long history and several different approaches have been developed . to see the main features of our approach , as well as the other dynamical models  @xcite",
    ", we briefly discuss how the nucleon resonances are extracted by the other analysis groups .",
    "it is common to parametrize  @xcite the partial - wave amplitudes in terms of polynomial functions , the breit - wigner forms , the tree diagrams of phenomenological lagrangian , or various combinations of them .",
    "the @xmath38-matrix method is used in these analyses to unitarize the constructed amplitudes . in most cases ,",
    "the resulting forms of partial - wave amplitudes depend algebraically on the energy variable @xmath39 and hence it is rather efficient numerically to fit the data and extract the resonances .",
    "the analyses  @xcite based on the unitary carnegie - mellon - berkeley model also only involve solving algebraic equations in extracting the resonances from the partial - wave amplitudes . in an approach based on a dcc model , such as the one defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : teq ] ) and  ( [ eq : veq ] ) , the partial - wave amplitudes are calculated by solving a set of coupled - channels integral equations .",
    "thus the computation effort needed in fitting the meson production data is considerably more complex than that of the @xmath38-matrix analyses .",
    "furthermore , the resulting partial - wave amplitudes , defined by the coupled - channels integral equations such as eqs .",
    "( [ eq : teq ] ) and  ( [ eq : veq ] ) used in our analysis , have complicated analytic structure and must be analyzed carefully to develop a correct procedure for extracting the nucleon resonances .",
    "compared with the models  @xcite with polynomial parameterizations of the partial - wave amplitudes , our approach as well as all dynamical models have an important constraint in fitting the data .",
    "in the polynomial fits , the parameters in each partial - wave of each channel are adjusted independently . however , the dynamical models have much less freedom in adjusting the parameters to fit the data because the partial - wave amplitudes in all partial waves and in all reaction channels are related to the same parameters of the meson - exchange mechanisms .",
    "obviously , a dcc approach is much more complex and difficult than the other approaches  @xcite .",
    "this however is needed to investigate the dynamical origin and the internal structure of the nucleon resonances . as can be seen from the ingredients of the interaction @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veq ] ) , the dynamical model considered in our approach is aimed at exploring a question whether a nucleon resonance can be interpreted as a system of a core state surrounded by a meson cloud , a molecule - like meson - baryon state , or a mixture of them .",
    "such an interpretation has been obtained for the @xmath41 ( 1232 ) resonance in various meson - exchange models of @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions up to @xmath42 gev .",
    "an example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath43 was interpreted as a baryon made of a core state and a pion cloud .",
    "the resulting core state can be identified , qualitatively , with the @xmath41 of a hadron structure model with only constituent - quark degrees of freedom .",
    "our earlier dcc analysis  @xcite has also provided useful information on the dynamical origin of the roper resonance , and has provided an interpretation of the mass of the first excited nucleon state with isospin - spin - parity @xmath44 predicted by most of the hadron structure models such as the model based on the dyson - schwinger equation of qcd  @xcite .",
    "the dcc analysis performed in this work is a necessary step toward improving our understanding of the dynamical origins and the structure of all nucleon resonances with mass below 2 gev .    in sec .",
