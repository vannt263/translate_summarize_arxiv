    "most of the existing theoretical investigations of surface diffusion @xcite are for cases where the interparticle interactions do not play an important role . approximations for strongly interacting systems",
    "have only been developed for some special cases @xcite , but a general understanding of the interaction effects is still lacking . at finite coverages , there are two different diffusion constants .",
    "the tracer diffusion coefficient @xmath0 is directly related to the motion of a tagged particle as observed in stm and field ion measurements , while the collective diffusion coefficient @xmath1 describes the macroscopic density fluctuations as measured in field emission and optical grating experiments @xcite . already in 1981 ,",
    "reed and ehrlich @xcite tried to relate @xmath1 also to the individual adparticle motion .",
    "they proposed that @xmath1 can be expressed as a product of a thermodynamical factor and an effective jump rate of adparticles .",
    "however , there was no rigorous theoretical basis for this decomposition , in which the effect of dynamical correlations ( memory effects ) is neglected @xcite .",
    "these memory effects originate from the fact that a backward jump of a diffusing particle is more likely than jumps to other sites .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to present a new method for studying surface diffusion within the lattice gas model @xcite .",
    "it is based on a combination of an analytic approach and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the only approximation involved in the new approach is that the memory effects are approximated by the known results for the langmuir gas model @xcite . in the langmuir gas , there are no direct interactions , but the double occupancy of lattice sites is excluded .",
    "it turns out that our result for @xmath1 is exactly of the form proposed in ref .",
    "we apply the theory to three different physical systems : o / w(110 ) @xcite , adlayer on a stepped substrate @xcite , and flexible , chainlike molecules on a flat substrate @xcite .",
    "we find that the predictions of the theory for collective diffusion compare very well with full mc simulations , thus justifying the validity of the reed - ehrlich description @xcite .",
    "moreover , the new method is computationally very efficient . for tracer diffusion ,",
    "however , we find the effect of interactions on the memory effects to be more pronounced .",
    "as a starting point for studying collective diffusion , we focus on the density - density autocorrelation function @xmath2 with an occupation variable @xmath3 at a lattice site @xmath4 at time @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding laplace - fourier transform is denoted by @xmath6 . using the mori projection operator formalism @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 contains microscopic jump rate information , @xmath9 is the thermodynamical susceptibility , and the memory function @xmath10 contains the dynamical correlations .",
    "the collective diffusion constant can be obtained from the correlation function @xmath6 by examining its pole in the limits @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite . in the limit @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of adparticles in a system",
    ", @xmath16 is the average jump rate and @xmath17 is the jump length along the direction @xmath18 .",
    "also @xmath19 is just the compressibility of the adsorbate overlayer .",
    "note that when the memory function @xmath20 is left out , this constitutes a dynamical mean field theory ( dmf ) for the collective diffusion constant .",
    "our novel combined approach consists of evaluating the average jump rate @xmath16 and the compressibility @xmath21 not through further analytic approximations @xcite , but rather by direct mc simulations .",
    "@xmath22 is directly obtained from the success ratio of individual particle jumps in the canonical ensemble , while @xmath23 is more conveniently evaluated within the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "this procedure is easily implemented for arbitrary interaction strengths and transition algorithms @xcite within the lattice gas model . for the memory function @xmath20 , we follow ferrando et al . @xcite and approximate it by the known expression for the langmuir gas model .",
    "thus the effect of direct interparticle interactions on @xmath20 is not taken into account . in the langmuir gas model",
    "the memory function for collective diffusion is exactly zero @xcite , and our approach corresponds to the dmf approximation for @xmath24 .",
    "( [ eq : mori ] ) then leads to an expression for @xmath24 exactly of the form first proposed by reed and ehrlich : @xmath25 for tracer diffusion , a similar analysis can be performed for the self - correlation function @xmath26 with @xmath27 , where the tracer occupation number at @xmath4 at time @xmath5 , @xmath28 , now refers to a tagged particle at @xmath29 . in the expression analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mori ] ) , the jump factor @xmath30 remains the same , @xmath9 is replaced by unity and the memory function @xmath31 differs from the corresponding one for collective diffusion .",
    "again , we approximate the correlation effects resulting from @xmath32 by the known expression for the langmuir model .",
    "the resulting expression for @xmath33 becomes @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a known correlation factor @xcite that depends only on the coverage @xmath36 and the geometry of the lattice .",
    "to summarize , our approach yields a dmf result for the collective diffusion constant @xmath24 . for the tracer diffusion constant @xmath33 , approximate correlation effects beyond the dmf",
    "are included .",
    "we now apply our formalism to study diffusion for three different systems based on lattice - gas models .",
    "the first system is o / w(110 ) @xcite .",
    "we study this system at a coverage of @xmath37 over a wide range of temperatures . at low temperatures ,",
    "the system is in the ordered p(@xmath38 ) phase , while for @xmath39 it is disordered .",
    "details of the model and mc simulations of the diffusion coefficients are in ref .  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) , we show the results for collective diffusion in an arrhenius plot .",
    "the agreement between the present dmf result and the direct mc data is remarkably good .",
    "furthermore , dmf works rather well in the strongly interacting region , i.e.  in the ordered phase and even close to @xmath40 , the difference being always less than 15% . for tracer diffusion shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) , on the other hand , the discrepancy between the mc data and the dmf corrected by the approximate correlation factor is more significant , and becomes most prominent in the ordered phase where the interaction effects are important .",
    "the second system we consider is an adsorbate layer on a substrate with equally spaced straight steps .",
    "in addition to repulsive nearest - neighbor interactions between the adsorbates , this model includes an extra binding energy at step edges , an extra barrier for climbing over step edges , and enhanced diffusion along step edges .",
    "a detailed description of the model and the formalism @xcite is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we compare the theoretical results for collective and tracer diffusion with the direct mc simulations at a temperature comparable to the adsorbate interactions and the various substrate - induced activation barriers . for collective diffusion ,",
    "the dmf gives again a very good description .",
    "for tracer diffusion , with the chosen parametrization @xcite , the component along the direction _",
    "perpendicular _ to the steps is still described rather well by the approximate theory . for the component along the direction _",
    "parallel _ to step edges , the approximate theory fails already at relatively low coverages .",
    "this can be explained by the increased concentration at step edges due to the extra binding energy there , which leads to nontrivial memory effects when tracer particles have to make detours via terraces to pass each other .",
    "the last system we consider , polymer chain molecules adsorbed on a flat substrate , is the most complex one .",
    "the chains are modelled by the two - dimensional fluctuating - bond model @xcite , in which the polymer segments occupy single sites on a lattice and occupation of nearest and next nearest neighbor sites is excluded .",
    "there are no direct interactions between the polymers in the model .",
    "however , an effective entropic repulsive interaction exists between the chains .",
    "a more detailed description of the model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) , we show a comparison for the diffusion constants calculated from both the present theory and the full mc simulation as a function of concentration @xmath36 @xcite . even for this complex system , there is good agreement between the two approaches for the collective diffusion .",
    "again , for the tracer diffusion whose results are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) , the discrepancy is significant , and the results from the two methods differ even qualitatively .",
    "the three model examples above clearly illustrate that in the case of collective diffusion , dynamical correlations between successive jumps of individual particles cancel out to a large degree even for a strongly interacting system , and the dynamical mean field theory ( dmf ) works well . for tracer diffusion ,",
    "the memory effects depend more strongly on the interaction between the adparticles and the approximate correlation effects from the langmuir gas model do not provide an adequate description .",
    "the success of the dmf for @xmath24 has provided us with a better understanding of collective diffusion as well as a practical tool for its evaluation . from the theoretical viewpoint , @xmath1 in the dmf description",
    "is related precisely to an average jump rate of the individual adparticles , thus justifying the phenomenological assumption of reed and ehrlich .",
    "it provides a conceptual link between the individual particle jump rates , such as those measured in stm and field ion microscope experiments , and macroscopic density fluctuation measurements like field emission and optical grating studies . on the practical side ,",
    "the calculation of the dmf description , including the average jump rate and the compressibility of the adparticles , is much easier to evaluate numerically compared with a direct simulation of @xmath1 .",
    "our preliminary results for the three model cases indicate that this speedup is typically of the order of @xmath41 , the method being most efficient for cases where large system sizes or unit cells are needed .    to conclude , our combined method provides a powerful tool for studying realistic models of complex systems .",
    "at present , we are employing the dmf formalism to study polymer chain molecules with direct interactions between them and surfaces with high concentration of imperfections such as steps , kinks and traps .",
