    "moreover , the small deformations hypothesis is commonly assumed .",
    "therefore , the stress @xmath1 is a function of the axial strain @xmath2 , for example a hyperbola , a hyperbolic tangent ( tanh ) , or a polynomial function . known as landau s law @xcite , the latter is widely used in the community of nondestructive testing @xcite .    under these assumptions , elastodynamics write as a @xmath3 hyperbolic system of conservation laws . for general initial data ,",
    "no analytical solution is known when @xmath4 is nonlinear .",
    "analytical solutions can be obtained in the particular case of piecewise constant initial data having a single discontinuity , i.e. the riemann problem .",
    "computing the solution to the riemann problem is of major importance to get a theoretical insight on the wave phenomena , but also for validating numerical methods .",

    "this condition has been omitted in @xcite , in the case of the quadratic landau s law .",
    "we prove that this kind of condition is obtained also in the case of elastodynamics , and that it involves also a restriction on the initial velocity jump .",
    "furthermore , it is shown in @xcite how to predict the nature of the physically admissible solution in the case of the @xmath5-system .",
    "we present here how it can be applied to elastodynamics .",
    "when @xmath1 has an inflexion point , it is neither convex nor concave .",
    "the physically admissible solution is much more complex than for the @xmath5-system , but the mathematics of nonconvex riemann problems are well established @xcite .",

    ", we state a condition which ensures the existence of the solution to the riemann problem .",
