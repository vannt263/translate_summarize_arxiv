    "nowadays the study of neutrino oscillations is the particle physicists best hope to learn how to extend the standard model , since it provides information on the neutrino masses and mixings which are thought to originate in new physics .",
    "neutrino oscillations are an example of flavor oscillations , which arise when the particles produced and detected in an experiment are superpositions of different mass eigenstates .",
    "the interference between the propagating mass eigenstates leads to a spatial oscillation of the detection probability of a neutrino with a given flavor . the standard oscillation formula , expressing the probability to detect a neutrino of momentum @xmath0 emitted with a flavor @xmath1 as having a flavor @xmath2 after a propagation on a distance @xmath3 , reads @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the neutrino mass eigenstates and @xmath6 is the matrix relating the flavor to the mass fields .",
    "this phenomenon can explain the depletion of the solar electron - neutrino flux @xcite , as well as the up / down asymmetry of the neutrino flux produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "moreover , the long baseline experiment k2k hints to a muon - neutrino depletion on a terrestrial distance @xcite , while controversial evidence for neutrino oscillations has appeared in the laboratory experiment lsnd @xcite .    in view of the importance of neutrino oscillations , it is rather unsettling that the neutrino oscillation formula ( [ standard ] ) used to analyze experimental results is nearly always derived in a completely inconsistent way . in particular , this derivation usually starts with unlocalized plane wave states and ends , strangely , with a space - dependent oscillation formula .",
    "this hocus - pocus requires at least two arbitrary assumptions : the equal time prescription , stating that the propagation time is the same for the different mass eigenstates , and the classical propagation condition , @xmath7 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "additional assumptions have generated endless discussions about the equality of the energy - momenta of the different mass eigenstates .",
    "moreover , the rejection of the equal time prescription by some authors has lead them to predict oscillation lengths differing from the standard result by some factor ( a factor 2 is often quoted ) .",
    "a more consistent derivation of the neutrino oscillation formula has been done in the _ intermediate wave packet model _ , in which the neutrino mass eigenstates are represented by wave packets propagating in space - time @xcite .",
    "although the classical propagation condition can be dispensed with , this method implicitly requires the use of the arbitrary equal time prescription in order to obtain the standard result for the oscillation length .",
    "moreover , this derivation is not wholly consistent because it involves flavor eigenstates which can not be well - defined @xcite . finally ,",
    "while the 3-momentum uncertainty is naturally included in this model , the energy uncertainty has to be put in by hand , with the result that there is no agreement on whether the coherence length has an upper bound or not @xcite .    in order to solve the various problems of the intermediate wave packet model",
    ", different models using quantum field theory have been proposed .",
    "they can be grouped in four categories .",
    "the first category groups the _ external wave packet models _ , the best example of which is given by the seminal paper by giunti , kim , lee and lee @xcite . in these models , the neutrino is considered as an internal line of a feynman diagram , propagating between a source and a detector , which are represented by in- and outgoing wave packets @xcite . a variation on this theme is the kiers - weiss model , in which the external wave packets are replaced by quantum oscillators @xcite .",
    "the second category groups the _ stationary boundary conditions models _ , the best example of which is given by the grimus - stockinger model @xcite .",
    "they are very similar to the external wave packet models , except that the wave packets are replaced by states with a well - defined energy , i.e. stationary states @xcite .",
    "the third category groups models where the neutrino is represented by its propagator and coupled at production with a source , though not coupled at detection with anything @xcite .",
    "note that this kind of model requires the equal time prescription , as in the intermediate wave packet model , in order to obtain the standard oscillation length , since the detection mechanism is left unspecified .",
    "the fourth category includes the blasone - vitiello model , in which the construction of a fock space of flavor eigenstates is attempted @xcite .",
    "while few authors deny that the most rigorous treatment of oscillations is done in a quantum field framework , the variety of such models has not made a good case for their widespread acceptance .",
    "besides , these models sometimes yield conflicting oscillation formulas , either because of their different assumptions or because of their different approximation methods . the main aim of this article is to show which of these results are correct and how they can all be understood within the external wave packet model . in particular ,",
    "the grimus - stockinger oscillation formula will be seen to be a limiting case of the giunti - kim - lee formula , while the ioannisian - pilaftsis and shtanov new oscillation formulas will be shown to be false . at the same time , the role of accurate energy measurements in the coherence length will be clarified .",
    "contrary to the existing literature , our calculations take into account the dispersion and do not resort to a relativistic limit . in this way",
    ", the final oscillation formula will be valid as well for neutrinos as for k and b mesons ( it will be shown that the spin can be neglected ) .",
    "this unification of the neutrino and meson oscillation formulas makes it much more difficult to accept nonstandard results , since the meson oscillations are well studied and the meson oscillation length has been cross - checked with different methods .",
    "another of our concerns will be to underline the quantum mechanical interpretation of the external wave packet model .",
    "the quantum field theory models are often perceived as complicated and obscure , whereas they also exist in simple versions @xcite and have a clear physical interpretation in direct correspondence with intermediate wave packet models .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . in the second section , the gaussian external wave packet model is reviewed and all useful definitions are given .",
    "the flavor - mixing amplitude is expressed as a convolution of the neutrino propagator with a function depending on the overlap of the external wave packets .",
    "this section does not contain new material and follows the notation of @xcite . in the third section , a new way to evaluate the convolution",
    "is explained , leading to an explicit oscillation formula .",
    "it is then shown that the coherence length , beyond which oscillations vanish , can be increased without bound by more accurate energy measurements . as a corollary",
    ", it is proved that the stationary boundary conditions model is a special case of the external wave packet model . in the fourth section , another new method to evaluate the convolution",
    "is presented , yielding the explicit dependence of the amplitude on time and distance .",
    "this method allows a clear physical interpretation of the amplitude in terms of wave packets .",
    "in particular , the propagation range is subdivided into three regimes by two thresholds marking the onset of the transversal and longitudinal dispersion of the wave packet . with this method , the new oscillation formulas proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite can be disproved .",
    "finally , we show that the blasone - vitiello oscillation formula @xcite is phenomenologically equivalent to the standard result .",
    "the propagating process of a particle between a source and a detector ( indicated by dotted circles ) is symbolized by the following diagram :        fig .  1 .",
    "propagation of a particle @xmath8 between a source and a detector , centered in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the arrows indicate the momentum flow .",
    "@xmath11 represents the set of incoming particles , of total momentum @xmath12 , arriving in the production region ( or source ) , which is centered around the point @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 represents the set of outgoing particles , of total momentum @xmath15 , coming from the production region , with the exception of the intermediate neutrino @xmath8 whose propagation is studied .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined similarly , but apply to the detection process .",
    "the interaction points at production and detection are noted @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "all particles are assumed to be stable .",
    "the internal line could also represent an antineutrino , but we shall assume that the experimental conditions are such that a quasi - real neutrino propagates on a macroscopic distance , transferring positive energy from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is a macroscopic time , it will be seen that the neutrino @xmath8 contributes to the propagation , but not its antiparticle .",
    "since known neutrinos are much lighter than the experimental energy thresholds , their masses can be neglected in the interaction vertices and in the numerator of the neutrino propagator . in that case",
    ", the spin structure factorizes from the sum over the mass eigenstates , so that the computation of the oscillation formula can be carried out as if the neutrinos were scalar .",
    "if one wants to consider nonrelativistic neutrinos , factorization also occurs for nearly degenerate masses .",
    "the only case where factorization does not occur is nonrelativistic neutrinos with very different masses .",
    "however , spatial oscillations vanish in these conditions since it is experimentally possible to determine which mass eigenstate contributes to the amplitude . in that case , a treatment with wave packets is not necessary , since the flavor - changing probability does not depend on the propagation distance . in the following",
    "we shall assume that the neutrinos are either relativistic or nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "thus the spin structure can be absorbed in an overall multiplying factor .",

    "condition ( [ onshell ] ) should simply be considered as expressing the conservation of energy - momentum .",
    "such kinematical constraints are usually not included in the oscillation formula , though they rightly belong to it .",
    "a complete computation of the transition probability should not only include this energy - momentum constraint , but also similar terms arising from the interaction amplitudes @xmath86 , from the prefactor resulting from the gaussian integration and from the spin structure of the propagator .",

    "the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) is similar to eq .",
    "( 26 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . however , three interesting new elements appear in eq .",
    "( [ oscformula ] ) : the parameter @xmath166 has been computed explicitly , the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) is valid for relativistic or nonrelativistic ( but nearly mass degenerate ) neutrinos , and the dispersion of the ` wave packet ' corresponding to the neutrino has been taken into account .",
    "this last fact is not at all obvious from the above computation , in which the amplitude @xmath59 has been inserted into the probability before doing the integration over the energy .",
    "had this energy integration been performed first , the explicit dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath202 would have been obtained , i.e. a gaussian spreading with @xmath47 in the direction @xmath58 . in section [ section4.3 ] this spreading will be interpreted as the longitudinal dispersion of the ` wave packet ' associated with the propagating neutrino .",
    "we shall also see that computations neglecting this dispersion lead to a result differing from eq .",
    "( [ oscformula ] ) in the nonrelativistic limit ( see eq .",
    "( [ falsecohlength ] ) ) .",
    "in contrast to the method of section [ section4.3 ] , the question of dispersion does not even arise in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ incohsumqft])-([oscformula ] ) in which it is automatically taken into account .",
    "another feature of the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) is the increase of the coherence length when a long coherent measurement in time is performed at the detector , even if the neutrino ` wave packets ' have separated spatially @xcite . in that case",
    ", the energy uncertainty at detection goes to zero , @xmath203 , so that the effective width also goes to zero , @xmath204 , and the coherence length becomes infinite , @xmath205 . at first sight , oscillations seem to vanish in that limit , because the localization term depending on @xmath206 seems to diverge @xcite .",
    "if it were true , it would be impossible to increase without limit the coherence length by performing long coherent measurements .",
    "note that this would be in contradiction with stationary boundary condition models , which have a zero energy uncertainty but an infinite coherence length .",
    "this apparent contradiction can be cleared up by examining carefully the term @xmath206 in the limit @xmath203 . with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ statlim ] ) , ( [ definitionrho ] ) and ( [ sigmaeff ] ) , one sees that @xmath207 where @xmath114 was defined as the size of the macroscopic detection region .",
    "thus the localization term does not give a stronger constraint than @xmath208 .",
    "this constraint is always satisfied , as it is equivalent to the constraint obtained by averaging the transition probability over the production region .",
    "therefore , the coherence length can be increased without bound by more accurate energy measurements , contrary to what was claimed in refs .",
    "note that this is not true if the accuracy of the 3-momentum measurements is increased , as the localization makes the oscillations vanish when the corresponding spatial uncertainty becomes larger than the oscillation length .",
    "of course the opposite conclusions would be reached if experiments measured time , not distance .    as a corollary ,",
    "the stationary limit of the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) is well - defined .",
    "stationary boundary conditions , @xmath209 and @xmath110 , lead to an infinite effective width @xmath173 and thus to an infinite coherence length . however , the product @xmath210 remains finite , as we have just explained .",
    "for example , the grimus - stockinger model @xcite is obtained in the limit @xmath178 , @xmath211 with @xmath212 .",
    "the latter condition means that this model can be recovered from the external wave packet model if the stationary limit has the property @xmath213 ( see discussion after eq .",
    "( [ statlim ] ) ) .",
    "though condition ( [ local1 ] ) becomes ineffective in that limit , the localization condition ( [ local2 ] ) is still present .",
    "thus there is no contradiction between models with stationary boundary conditions and those with external wave packets .",
    "the former type of model can be obtained from the latter in a smooth limit .    in conclusion , if the observability conditions @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 are satisfied , the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) reduces to the standard formula ( [ standard ] ) , with the additional property of @xmath217 geometrical decrease .",
    "with result ( [ oscformula ] ) , we have been able to reconcile the oscillation formulas proposed on the one hand by giunti , kim and lee @xcite and on the other hand by grimus and stockinger @xcite .",
    "more generally , the stationary boundary conditions models have been shown to be special cases of the external wave packet models .",
    "we have seen that eq .",
    "( [ oscformula ] ) reduces to the standard oscillation formula ( [ standard ] ) if some observability conditions are verified ; otherwise oscillations vanish .",
    "however , other authors also working in a quantum field framework have argued that formula ( [ oscformula ] ) is not valid for all experimental conditions .",
    "first , ioannisian and pilaftsis @xcite derive a formula for neutrino oscillations which exhibits a plane wave behaviour , if the condition @xmath218 is satisfied ( with @xmath219 , as usual ) .",
    "by ` plane wave oscillations ' , these authors mean that the oscillation amplitude @xmath59 does not decrease as the inverse of the distance , that its phase depends on the direction @xmath58 as @xmath220 , and that the amplitude is not negligible in directions other than along the neutrino momentum .",
    "if it were true , the oscillation length measured by a specific detector would depend on the direction of the total momentum of the initial particles . to give a typical example",
    ", the above ` plane wave condition ' is satisfied for atmospheric neutrinos if @xmath221 cm ( with @xmath222 km and @xmath223gev ) .",
    "unfortunately , this condition appears nowhere in the treatment of the previous section .",
    "actually , it is not clear whether the grimus - stockinger theorem is valid under this condition since its derivation uses the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "secondly , shtanov @xcite argues that the relative weights of the oscillating exponentials can be strongly sensitive to the neutrino masses , if the source and detector are strongly localized .",
    "since this author works in configuration space , the derivation of the previous section can not be useful to assess his claim .",
    "thus , the examination of the claims made by ioannisian , pilaftsis and shtanov requires another method of evaluation of the amplitude ( [ ampli ] ) . instead of using the grimus - stockinger theorem to integrate on the 3-momentum , we shall first perform the integration on the energy with the jacob - sachs theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem is based on the assumption that the energy spectrum of all incident particles is limited to a finite range .",
    "thus the overlap function @xmath138 is distinct from zero only for @xmath224 within certain bounds ( with @xmath225 ) . on this interval ,",
    "@xmath138 is taken to be infinitely differentiable . in that case",
    ", the jacob - sachs theorem says that the asymptotic value of the energy integral in eq .",
    "( [ ampli ] ) , when @xmath226 , is given by its residue at the pole below the real axis .",
    "thus the evaluation of the partial amplitude ( [ ampli ] ) with this theorem yields @xmath227 where @xmath228 . for gaussian external wave packets , the overlap function is given by eq .",
    "( [ overlappd ] ) . in principle",
    ", this function should be cut off outside the energy range determined by experimental conditions so as to satisfy the conditions of the jacob - sachs theorem .",
    "however these corrections are very small and will be neglected in the computations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the amplitude ( [ jacobsachsinteg ] ) is mathematically equivalent to the amplitude obtained in the intermediate wave packet model @xcite , in which the neutrino mass eigenstates are directly represented by wave packets .",
    "the overlap function @xmath229 corresponds to the wave function of the jth mass eigenstate .",
    "thus , it makes sense , in an external wave packet model , to talk about mass eigenstate ` wave packets ' associated with the propagating neutrino .",
    "note however that the overlap function takes into account not only the properties of the source , but also of the detector , which is a bit unusual for a wave packet interpretation .",
    "the integration over the 3-momentum in eq .",
    "( [ jacobsachsinteg ] ) can not be done analytically .",
    "resorting to the explicit form ( [ overlappd ] ) of the overlap function valid for gaussian external wave packets , we see that the integral ( [ jacobsachsinteg ] ) can be approximated by means of an asymptotic expansion for which two kinds of large parameters can be used . on the one hand , @xmath230 and @xmath231 are large parameters appearing in the overlap function ( [ overlappd ] ) .",

    "thus laplace s method will be valid for a longer time @xmath47 in the direction @xmath123 than in directions transverse to this vector .",
    "for this reason , the choice of the integration method in the direction @xmath123 will be postponed for a short while , while the method of stationary phase will be preferred for momentum integrations in directions transverse to @xmath123 .",
    "let the @xmath319 axis be along @xmath58 , i.e.  @xmath385 .",
    "as in section [ section4.2 ] , the examination of the amplitude ( [ jacobsachsinteg ] ) shows that the quick variation of the phase averages the amplitude to zero unless @xmath123 and @xmath354 are nearly parallel .",
    "the method of stationary phase will thus be applied in directions @xmath386 , the stationary points of which are given by @xmath387 .",

    "however , the prefactor @xmath400 present in the amplitude ( [ longitudinalamplitude ] ) gives in that case a delta function look - alike of width @xmath402 , introducing an additional momentum uncertainty which is larger than the mass difference @xmath403 since @xmath404 .",
    "for this reason , it is preferable to avoid this shortcut ( note that it yields the same final answer as given by the following method ) .",
    "moreover , it is interesting for the physical interpretation to postpone the time average , so as to obtain the explicit dependence of the amplitude on time and distance .",
    "as in the case of transverse momenta integrals , the choice of the method to perform the longitudinal momentum integration ( [ longitudinalamplitude ] ) is done by comparing the expansions of the phase and of the overlap function around the value @xmath405 for which @xmath406 is extremal .",

    "the wave packet interpretation of the amplitude ( [ longdisp ] ) is not obvious but the shape of the associated wave packet can be studied by an expansion around the maximum of the amplitude .",
    "once more , the time average of the transition probability ( [ proba ] ) is computed by laplace s method ( see ref .",

    "the dispersion length does not play any special role in the final result .",
    "thus , each method is accurate enough to be extended to the whole range of distances . however , the physical interpretation of the terms appearing in the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) depends on the relative values of @xmath3 and @xmath434 . from the detailed analysis done in @xcite ,",
    "these terms can be interpreted as follows :    * in the transverse - dispersion regime , the coherence - length term mainly arises from the progressive spatial separation of ` wave packets ' , due to their different group velocities .",
    "the localization term mainly arises from the initial spread of the ` wave packet ' , which must be smaller than the oscillation length .",

    "note that @xmath435 if @xmath436 . in that case",
    ", one can check that decoherence occurs for @xmath437 .",
    "* in the longitudinal - dispersion regime , the coherence - length term mainly arises from the spreading of the neutrino ` wave packet ' : the interference term is averaged to zero by the time integral as the spread of the wave packet becomes large .",
    "the localization term mainly arises from the separation of the ` wave packets ' : if they are spatially separate at the onset of the longitudinal - dispersion regime , they will never again overlap because their separation increases as fast as their dispersion .",
    "this is a new explanation for the origin of these two terms .",
    "thus the origins of the coherence - length and localization terms in the transverse - dispersion regime become respectively the origins of the localization and coherence - length terms in the longitudinal - dispersion regime .",
    "the situation can be summarized in the following diagram , where ` wp ' is an abbreviation for ` wave packet ' : +    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    table i. origins of the coherence - length and localization terms .",
    "it is now possible to examine shtanov s analysis in configuration space @xcite , since the explicit @xmath438 dependence of the amplitude @xmath59 has been computed for the whole range of distances ( see eqs .",
    "( [ nodispersion ] ) , ( [ transdisp ] ) and ( [ longdisp ] ) ) .",
    "this author works directly with the neutrino propagator in configuration space , and considers the space - time variables @xmath439 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) as macroscopic variables . his model will be considered in a scalar version in order to make the comparison with our results easier . in configuration space ,",
    "the propagator for a scalar neutrino propagating from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is asymptotically ( @xmath440 ) given by @xmath441 where @xmath442 is the lorentz interval .",
    "shtanov then computes the convolution of this propagator with a source . in the case of a monochromatic source",
    ", he obtains the standard oscillation formula .",
    "however , a convolution with a strongly localized source ( @xmath443 ) leads to an amplitude that keeps its dependence on the mass prefactor @xmath444 . in that case",
    ", the transition probability is not equivalent to the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) , at least if the neutrino masses are not nearly degenerate .",
    "we proceed to show that shtanov s result is incorrect .",
    "note first that the amplitude ( [ shtanovresult ] ) is in correspondence with our amplitude ( [ longdisp ] ) , computed with the stationary phase method , since the prefactor in eq .  ( [ longdisp ] ) can be rewritten , for @xmath445 , as @xmath446 where the definition ( [ dispersiontime ] ) of the dispersion time has been used .",
    "this prefactor coincides with the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ shtanovresult ] ) .",
    "however , the subsequent time average of the transition probability completely cancels this dependence on the mass , yielding eq .",

    "( [ longdisp ] ) around the average propagation time .",
    "the width with respect to @xmath47 of the amplitude @xmath59 is found to be equal to @xmath447 ( where @xmath448 is the lorentz factor associated with the velocity @xmath429 ) , thereby providing a @xmath40-dependent factor that cancels the @xmath40 prefactor in the gaussian integration .",
    "shtanov does not obtain such a result , since he does not average the probability on time . besides",
    ", the mass prefactors would remain even if a time average were performed on the probability : no ` wave packet envelope ' appears indeed in shtanov s amplitude , as this author does not try to compute the explicit convolution of the propagator ( [ shtanovresult ] ) with a wave packet source of arbitrary width .",
    "for that reason , he wrongly concludes that the mass prefactor remains if the source is strongly localized .",
    "shtanov also derives another oscillation formula for mass eigenstates such that @xmath449 .",
    "however , it can be checked that decoherence occurs in that case . in conclusion ,",
    "shtanov s computations in configuration space do not lead to new oscillation formulas .",
    "the last case to be considered is the oscillation formula obtained by blasone , vitiello and collaborators ( hereafter abbreviated as bv ) .",
    "these authors have attempted to define a fock space of weak eigenstates and to derive a nonperturbative oscillation formula @xcite .",
    "they define flavor creation and annihilation operators , satisfying canonical ( anti)commutation relations , by means of bogoliubov transformations .",
    "apart from the speculative nature of the undertaking , the drawbacks of the approach are the dependence on time , not on space , of the oscillation formula , as well as the lack of observability conditions .",
    "the latter problem is important since it determines whether the new features of the bv oscillation formula are observable in practice .",
    "since the bv oscillation formula tends to the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) in the relativistic limit or if the mass eigenstates are nearly degenerate ( with the coherence - length and localization terms removed ) , we can focus on the case of a nonrelativistic oscillating particle having very distinct mass eigenstates . in that case ,",
    "@xmath450 , so that either @xmath451 or @xmath452",
    ". under these conditions , the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) shows that oscillations vanish , either because of the localization term or because of the coherence - length term ( though eq .",
    "( [ oscformula ] ) is strictly speaking not valid in the case considered , localization and coherence - length conditions are generic features of quantum - mechanical models of oscillations @xcite ) .",
    "once the oscillation terms have been averaged to zero both in the bv formula and in eq .",
    "( [ oscformula ] ) , these two oscillation formulas do not differ anymore .",
    "therefore , the bv formalism does not seem to be relevant to the phenomenology of oscillations on macroscopic distances .",
    "this observation does not detract from the theoretical worth of that approach .",
    "we shall not treat here the charged lepton oscillations obtained by srivastava , widom and sassaroli @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a discussion of this subject .",
    "in this article , we have shown that all correct results obtained by applying quantum field theory to neutrino oscillations far from the source are incorporated in the oscillation formula ( [ oscformula ] ) .",
    "closer to the source ( i.e. for @xmath453 ) , this formula is modified in only one respect without repercussions on the oscillation length : the global spatial distribution of the detection probability has the form given in eq .",
    "( [ probanodisp ] ) , with the consequence that the neutrino propagation is restricted within a cylinder instead of a cone . the quantum field oscillation formulas ( [ oscformula ] ) and ( [ probanodisp ] ) are equivalent to the standard result ( [ standard ] ) if some observability conditions are verified .",
    "the new oscillations formulas proposed by ioannisian and pilaftsis @xcite and by shtanov @xcite have been disproved , while the blasone - vitiello formula @xcite has been shown to be phenomenologically equivalent to the standard result . besides , arguments against oscillations of charged leptons , as proposed by srivastava , widom and sassaroli @xcite , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have insisted on the fact that the flavor - mixing transition amplitude can be interpreted in terms of wave packets , so that oscillations can be seen , like in the intermediate wave packet model , as the result of an interference between propagating wave packets .",
    "moreover , the equivalence ( [ incohsumqft ] ) shows that this physical picture still holds in the case of stationary boundary conditions , provided that an incoherent sum over the energy is performed , contrary to what was claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a byproduct of our analysis ,",
    "the propagation of a particle has been shown to go through three regimes , separated by two thresholds which are marked by the onset of first the transversal dispersion and then the longitudinal dispersion of the associated wave packet .",
    "this picture has been found to be useful for the understanding of the terms present in the oscillation formula as well as for the computation of the correct spatial distribution of the probability .",
    "we believe that the wave packet interpretation is the only consistent picture of the oscillation process .",
    "in particular , it shows the irrelevance of discussions bearing on the neutrino energy - momentum , since it has not a unique value for a given mass eigenstate , but rather a spread described by the overlap function @xmath229 .",
    "one could wonder what advantage the external wave packet model has over the intermediate wave packet model , apart from being the only consistent way to derive the oscillation formula . actually , the quantum field formula ( [ oscformula ] ) has two important new features with respect to the quantum mechanical result .",
    "first , the energy uncertainty is not put in by hand , but is defined in terms of the 3-momentum widths and velocities of the in- and outgoing wave packets ( see eq .",
    "( [ energywidth ] ) ) , with the result that the stationary limit is well - defined and that it is possible to analyze the dependence of the coherence length on the accuracy of energy measurements .",
    "secondly , the oscillation formula is valid as well for neutrinos as for k and b mesons , putting it on a much firmer phenomenological basis .",
    "this might be useful in the light of the numerous nonstandard oscillation formulas existing in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the stationary limit has been considered in our computations to show the great generality of the external wave packet model .",
    "the stationary assumption is not problematic for the derivation of the oscillation formula .",
    "however , this limiting case is rather unphysical .",
    "the computations of section [ section4 ] have indeed shown that boundary conditions can be considered as stationary when @xmath454 .",
    "this constraint , which can be rewritten either as @xmath455 or as @xmath456 ( verified either at the source or at the detector ) , is extremely stringent . in the example of atmospheric neutrinos",
    ", the process can be considered as stationary if @xmath457mev or equivalently if @xmath458s .",
    "these conditions are far from being realized at the microscopic level in any known neutrino source or detector .",
    "although most neutrino sources are stationary from a macroscopic point of view , there is no reason to think that individual particles in the source and detector remain unperturbed in coherent states over macroscopic time scales : the sun is certainly not stationary at the atomic scale , and neither is a detection process where charged leptons are observed with a finite energy and time spread @xcite .",
    "a subject deserving further investigation in the quantum field framework is the influence of the decay width of the source of the neutrino .",
    "the case of decay at rest has been studied in detail with the wigner - weisskopf approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the treatment of decay in flight @xcite is still unsatisfactory .",
    "unstable neutrinos have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we would be sorry to leave the reader with the impression that the quantum field approach to oscillations is complicated . actually , this is a consequence of the generality of the external wave packet model . for pedagogical purposes ,",
    "it is interesting to resort to a simplified quantum field model , where the source and detector are perfectly located in space and in- and outgoing states are stationary @xcite .",
