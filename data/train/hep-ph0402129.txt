    "since many years , intensive studies are being performed to design future software architectures for experiments on proton proton colliders , such as the tevatron or the lhc @xcite and high energy @xmath3 linear colliders such as jlc , nlc @xcite or tesla @xcite .",
    "one of the important ingredients in such designs is the data structure for storing the monte carlo events .",
    "it is generally accepted that the data structures based on objects such as particles , clusters , strings , etc . with properties such as tracks , momenta , colour , spin , mass , etc . and on the relations explaining the origins and descendants of the objects is the most convenient one .",
    "this is the case at present @xcite , and it is also envisaged for the future , see @xcite . at the same time such",
    "a picture is in conflict with the basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "einstein  rosen ",
    "podolsky paradox is an example of such phenomena .",
    "a general problem is that the quantum state of a multiparticle system can not ( at least in principle ) be represented as a statistical combination of the states defined by the products of the pure quantum states of the individual particles .",
    "it is thus of the utmost importance to examine whether the approximation enforced by the data structure is purely academic , or if it rather represents a real difficulty , which may affect the interpretation of the future data .",
    "in fact in some cases alternative methods can be designed and are in fact used as well .",
    "it would not be a serious problem if the predictions of the standard model used in the interpretation of the future data could be provided by a single program , black box , without any need of analysing its parts . then anything that would be measured beyond the prediction of such a hypothetical monte carlo program",
    "would be interpreted as `` new physics '' .",
    "agreement , on the other hand , would constitute confirmation of the standard model , as it is understood at present ( and proper functioning of the detector as well ) .",
    "however , even in such an extreme case it is very useful , for the purpose of experimental studies , to manipulate with the terms responsable for the signature of the ` new physics ' . in this way",
    "experimental strategies can be refined , if the new effects can be placed in well defined and phenomenologically simple modules .    because of the complexity of the problem , monte carlo predictions need to be dealt with by programs describing : the action of the detector and of the analysis , on the experimental side , and various effects , such as those from hard processes , hadronization , decay of resonances , etc .",
    ", on the theoretical side .",
    "every part is inevitably calculated with some approximation , which need to be controlled .",
    "in the first part i will discuss solution we used in koralz @xcite  the program widely used at lep for the simulation of @xmath0-lepton pair production and decay , including spin and qed bremssstrahlung effects . even though spin effects are non - treatable in the scheme where properties are attributed to individual particles only , it is the very method used there . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite the algorithm of spin generation for any individual event was consisting of the following steps :    1 .",
    "an event consisting of a pair of @xmath0 leptons , bremsstrahlung photons , etc . , was generated .",
    "2 .   helicity states for both @xmath4 and @xmath5 were generated . at this point ,",
    "an approximation with respect to quantum mechanisc was introduced .",
    "information on these helicty states , including the definition of quantization frames , i.e. the relation between @xmath0 s rest frame and laboratory frame , was then transmitted to tauola @xcite , the package for the generation of @xmath0-lepton decays .",
    "finally tauola performed decays of 100% polarized @xmath0 s , and the event in the hepevt common block was completed .",
    "the solution for the spin treatment of @xmath0 leptons at lep was optimal .",
    "on one side , a convenient picture of particles with properties , origins and descendants could be used and , on the other , a complete full spin solution @xcite was available , if necessary .",
    "let us now turn to another example of the spin implementation algorithm .",
    "it is taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the algorithm , essentially that of koralz , was adopted to work with any monte carlo program providing the production of @xmath0-leptons .",
    "if the generated events are stored in the format of a hepevt common block , then the algorithm consisting of the following basic steps can be used :    1 .   search for @xmath0-leptons in a hepevt common block ( filled by any mc program ) .",
    "2 .   check what the origin of @xmath0lepton is : @xmath6 or eventually , @xmath7body process such as : @xmath8 .",
    "3 .   for the @xmath7body process of @xmath0-pair production , it is sometimes possible to calculate the @xmath0 polarization as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath0lepton pair and angle between the directions of @xmath0leptons and incoming effective beams ( in the rest frame of @xmath0-pair ) .",
    "4 .   if in addition to the @xmath0-leptons , photons or partons ( gluons , quarks , etc . )",
    "are stored in hepevt common block , one needs to define the `` effective incoming beams '' .",
    "5 .   from such an information",
    "one can generate @xmath0 helicity states and define the relation between the @xmath0 rest frame and the laboratory frame .",
    "optionally complete spin effects can be implemented as well , see  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decay is generated with the help of tauola and hepevt common block is appended with the @xmath0 s decay products .",
    "leading spin effects are nicely reproduced by the above set of programs . a more complete discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( 100,90 ) ( 0,-2)(0,0)[lb ]    let us stress , that the presented above solution , require certain minimal discipline in a way how the event records are filled in .",
    "at present , there is a strong tendency to store in event record , not only information on the ` real particles ' , but also on the results of the simulation at the parton shower level as well as of the hard process alone . as a consequence",
    "not only the same entries for the otherwise well defined partilces like @xmath0-leptons are duplicated or even triplicated , but also the relation between different entries is not anymore of the tree - type and links between particles are not reversible .",
    "the link upwards from @xmath9 to @xmath10 does not mean that there is downward link from @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "this creates multitude of troubles for the algorithms analyzing events , see fig .",
    "[ hepij ] .",
    "however at present our solution for interfacing decay packages with the host programs based on hepevt event record as filled by pythia and herwig seem to work in all cases studied by us @xcite . for the case of complete spin correlations , we found it more convenient to abandon direct use of spin information provided by the host programs",
    ". instead we choose to calculate complete density matrix anew , from the kinematical configuration provided by the host program .",
    "let us sketch the basic principles behind the proposed measurement , in the case , when simultaneosly scalar and pseudoscalar couplings are allowed in @xmath11 vertex @xmath12    if non - zero cp - odd admixture to the higgs is present , the distribution of the higgs production angle is modified  @xcite . we have simulated production angular distributions as in the sm , but this assumption has no influence on the validity of the analysis . in order to study the sensitivity of @xmath13 observables",
    ", we assume a sm production rate inependent of the size of the cp - odd admixture .",
    "the production process @xmath14 has been chosen , as an representative example , and simulated with the monte carlo program pythia 6.1 @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson mass of 120 gev and a centre - of - mass energy of 350 gev was chosen .",
    "the effects of initial state bremsstrahlung were included .",
    "for the sake of our discussion and in all of our samples the @xmath0 decays have been generated with the tauola monte carlo library @xcite .",
    "as usual , to facilitate the interpretation of the results , bremsstrahlung effects in decays were not taken into account . anyway , with the help of additional simulation , we have found this effect to be rather small . to include the full spin effects in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 decay chain ,",
    "the interface explained in ref .",
    "@xcite was used .",
    "the higgs boson parity information must be extracted from the correlations between @xmath18 and @xmath19 spin components , which are further reflected in correlations between the @xmath0 decay products in the plane transverse to the @xmath20 axes @xcite . to better visualize the effect ,",
    "let us write the decay probability , using the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 can be understood as an operator for the rotation by an angle @xmath23 around the @xmath24 direction .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the @xmath27 polarization vectors , which are defined in their respective rest frames .",
    "the symbols @xmath24/@xmath28 denote components parallel / transverse to the higgs boson momentum as seen from the respective @xmath27 rest frames .",
    "the method relies on measuring the acoplanarity angle of the two planes , spanned on @xmath29 decay products and defined in the @xmath30 pair rest frame .",
    "the acoplanarity angle @xmath31 , between the planes of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 decay products is defined .",
    "the angle is defined first , with the help of its cosine and two vectors @xmath34 normal to the planes , namely @xmath35 , @xmath36 .    to distinguish between the two cases : @xmath31 and @xmath37 it is sufficient , for example , to find the sign of @xmath38 .",
    "when it is negative , the angle @xmath31 as defined above ( and in the range @xmath39 ) is used .",
    "otherwise it is replaced by @xmath40 .",
    "additional selection cuts need to be applied .",
    "the events need to be divided into two classes , depending on the sign of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 the energies of @xmath43 are to be taken in the respective @xmath27 rest frames . in refs .",
    "@xcite the methods of reconstruction of the replacement @xmath27 rest frames were proposed with and without the help of the @xmath0 impact parameter .",
    "we will use these methods here as well , without any modification .    to test the feasibility of the measurement , some assumptions about the detector effects had to be made ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "we have used the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ rys4 ] the acoplanarity distribution angle @xmath31 of the @xmath45 decay products which was defined in the rest frame of the reconstructed @xmath45 pair , is shown .",
    "the two plots represent events selected by the differences of @xmath46 energies , defined in their respective @xmath27 rest frames . in the left plot",
    ", it is required that @xmath47 , whereas in the right one , events with @xmath48 are taken .",
    "this figure quantifies the size of the parity effect .",
    "the size of the effect is substantially diminished when a detector - like set - up was included for @xmath27 rest frames reconstruction , in exactly the same proportion as in ref .",
    "@xcite , nonetheless parity effect remain visible .",
    "the fitting procedure was repeated 400 times with acoplanarity distributions extracted from independent samples of 1  ab@xmath49 luminosity each , with a nominal value of @xmath50 .",
    "a precision on @xmath51 from such a pseudo - experiment of approximately 6@xmath52 can be anticipated .",
    "the combination of generators for production and decay of intermediate states , require careful treatment of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "in some cases one can restrict spin states to pure helicities ; then generation of intermediate states for individual particles can be performed first , and decays of each individual particle can be performed later .",
    "the general case , when full quantum mechanical spin correlations are included was also discussed .",
    "technical constraints for the solution based on kinematical information provided by the production programme to be used by the decay routines , were presented . in this context gramatic rules on how event records are filled in were discussed as well .",
    "finally discussion of observable for the higgs boson parity measurement at lc , based on such a technical solution was presented in detail , as an example .",
    "it was shown , on the basis of careful monte carlo simulation of both theoretical and detector effects that with the typical parameters of the future detector and linear collider set - up the hypotesis of the admixture of pseudoscalar coupling to the _ otherwise _ standard model 120 gev higgs boson can be measured up to 6@xmath53 error on the mixing angle .",
