    "in recent years , with the observation of observables related to transversity , there has been renewed theoretical attention@xcite to the gauge invariance of qcd operators in the definition of unintegrated , i.e. , transverse - momentum dependent ( tmd ) , parton distribution functions ( pdf)s.@xcite the core components of such quantities are gauge links ( also called wilson lines ) which are , in general , gauge - contour dependent and have , therefore , more complicated renormalization properties ensuing from their contour obstructions : end - points , cusps , and self - intersections.@xcite in fact , as we pointed out in refs .  , the gauge - invariant definition of tmd pdfs,@xcite , which includes gauge links in the transverse direction , inevitably involves gauge contours with a cusped - like junction point .",
    "the renormalization effect on this point induces extra ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences which give rise to an anomalous dimension that in one - loop order coincides with the corresponding term of the universal cusp anomalous dimension.@xcite    we argued in refs .   that in order to counter this problem , the fully gauge - invariant definition of the tmd pdfs has to include an additional soft ( eikonal ) factor@xcite along a special cusped gauge contour ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : redefinition ] ) which extends to the light - cone infinity in the transverse direction and serves to compensate the spurious contribution to the anomalous dimension peculiar to the light - cone gauge in connection with the advanced , retarded , or principal - value prescription . on the other hand",
    ", we have demonstrated@xcite that adopting instead the mandelstam - leibbrandt ( ml ) pole prescription@xcite for the gluon propagator , such contributions are absent so that the anomalous dimension of the tmd pdf coincides with the result in covariant gauges , while the uv - divergent part of the soft factor reduces to unity .",
    "the study of inclusive processes , e.g. , deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) , involves integrated parton distribution functions which have the following gauge - invariant definition ( @xmath1 labels the sort of the parton in hadron @xmath2 ) @xmath3           \\gamma^{+ } \\psi_{i}\\left(0^{-}\\right )    |h(p ) \\rangle \\big|_{\\xi^{+},\\ ,    \\mbox{\\footnotesize\\boldmath$\\scriptstyle\\xi_\\perp$ } = 0 } \\label{eq : ipdf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and have renormalization properties controlled by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equation .",

    "the study of semi - inclusive processes , such as semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , or the drell - yan ( dy ) process  where one more final or initial hadron is detected and its transverse momentum is observed  requires the introduction of more complicated quantities , viz .",

    "the way out is to include into the definition of the tmd pdf also a gauge link in the transverse direction off the light cone.@xcite then , in order to eliminate both gauge links , that along the light cone and the transverse one , one has to adopt the light - cone ( lc ) gauge @xmath6 together with the advanced boundary condition to go around the poles of the gluon propagator in the complex @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) plane.@xcite the gluon propagator in the @xmath6 gauge has the form @xmath10 }    \\right ) \\label{eq : gluon - prop}\\ ] ] and has to be evaluated according to one of the following pole prescriptions @xmath11}\\bigg|_{\\rm ret / adv } =    \\frac{1}{q^+ \\pm i \\eta } \\ , \\ \\ \\",

    "the one - loop diagrams ( see fig .  [",

    "this is that the junction point of the two transverse gauge links at light - cone infinity is such that the two gauge ( i.e. , integration ) contours are joined smoothly .",
    "however , we have shown@xcite by explicit calculation of the uv divergences of these diagrams that extra contributions appear that generate an anomalous dimension equal  at this loop order  to the universal cusp anomalous dimension.@xcite [ whether this finding remains valid in higher loop orders has not been proved yet .",
    "] this indicates that the transverse gauge links off the light cone have a cusp - like junction point whose renormalization gives a nontrivial contribution to the anomalous dimension of the tmd pdf .",

    "diagram ( d ) is associated with the transverse gauge link and , hence , it is peculiar to the light - cone gauge .",
    "note that the hermitian - conjugate diagrams ( labeled @xmath18 ) are generated by `` mirror '' diagrams which are not shown explicitly .",

    ", the transverse component of the gauge field reads @xmath19 where the numerical constant @xmath20 depends on the pole prescription to treat the light - cone divergences in the notation of ref .",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 is an ir regulator that does not enter the final results .    using dimensional regularization within the @xmath23 scheme",
    ", one can now compute the contributions of diagrams ( a ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] : @xmath24 and @xmath25 . diagram ( a ) contains uv divergences which translate into a single pole @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , it contains divergences which are related to the poles of the gluon propagator in the @xmath6 gauge and are controlled by the employed pole prescription  embodied in the factor @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , it also contains a uv - finite ( i.e. , @xmath27-independent ) part , which has , however , rapidity divergences  i.e .",
    ", a term proportional to @xmath20 . the explicit expressions for all these terms can be found in ref ..    on the other hand , diagram ( d ) , which , we repeat , is absent in covariant gauges , contains rapidity divergences driven by @xmath20 ( see in ref .   for the explicit expression and further details ) .",
    "it turns out that  including the mirror diagrams of ( a ) and ( d)this contribution exactly cancels all terms proportional to @xmath20 in @xmath28 and also in @xmath29 , rendering the total expression pole - prescription independent .",

    "hence , the backfit logic in this finding is to modify the definition of the tmd pdf in eq .",

    "imposing the mandelstam - leibbrandt ( ml ) pole prescription,@xcite which depends on both variables @xmath46 and @xmath0 , gives rise to a more complicated structure of the gluon propagator in the complex @xmath9 plane , viz .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "our goal is to evaluate diagrams @xmath32 and @xmath33 in fig.[fig : fig1 ] using this pole prescription . in that case ,",
    "the evaluation of @xmath24 is more complicated and we refer for the technical steps to ref .  .",

    "bottom line : using the mandelstam - leibbrandt pole prescription to treat the rapidity divergences in the gluon propagator in association with the light - cone gauge , no anomalous - dimension defect appears , so that one gets the well - known expression @xmath60",
    "consider now the case with the ml pole prescription .",
    "as we have already discussed , this pole prescription removes all undesirable light - cone singularities .",
    "therefore , we should expect that the insertion of the soft factor @xmath61 in that case does not destroy this property . skipping details ,",
    "let us remark that the uv singularities of the soft factor are generated by the self - energy of the lightlike gauge link and the one - gluon exchanges between the lightlike and the transverse gauge link ( analogous diagrams to @xmath32 and @xmath33 in fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we observe that the integral above vanishes by virtue of the location of the poles in the feynman and ml denominators on the same side of the @xmath46-axis .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath75 for the same reason , also the contribution of diagram @xmath33 vanishes , entailing @xmath76 . on the other hand , the contribution arising from real gluons , @xmath77 , does not contain uv - singularities .",
    "hence , the uv - divergent part of @xmath78 reduces to unity , validating eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmd_re - definition ] ) also for the case of the light - cone gauge with the ml - prescription .",
    "the evolution behavior of tmd pdfs is of particular theoretical and phenomenological importance.@xcite theoretically , we have to verify whether the integrated pdf , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmd_re - definition ] ) , coincides with the standard one with no contour artifacts left over .",
    "furthermore , we have to deal with the additional dependence on the scale @xmath12 by means of an additional evolution equation .",
    "note that in our approach this mass parameter plays a role akin to the rapidity parameter @xmath79 in the collins - soper evolution equation.@xcite we have discussed@xcite some of these issues and shown that the redefined tmd pdf satisfies the following renormalization - group equation @xmath80 taking logarithmic derivatives of @xmath81 with respect to both scales @xmath82 and @xmath12 , we get @xmath83 =    0 \\ , , \\label{eq : cons}\\ ] ] which establishes the formal analogy between our approach and the collins - soper one.@xcite we emphasize that only the modified definition via eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmd_re - definition ] ) satisfies such simple evolution equations .",
    "we have discussed an approach to tmd pdfs which takes into account the renormalization properties of the contour - dependent gauge links in terms of the anomalous dimensions ensuing from contour obstructions . we argued that supplementing the light - cone gauge with @xmath0-independent pole prescriptions for the gluon propagator , leads to the appearance of an anomalous dimension that can be associated with a cusped junction point of the transverse gauge contours .",
    "in contrast , we found that when the ml prescription is employed , which depends on both variables @xmath46 and @xmath0 , the defect of the anomalous dimension cancels out . in the first case ,",
    "a nontrivial soft factor in the definition of the tmd pdf restores the correct anomalous dimension by compensating the renormalization effect on the cusp - like junction point of the contours . in the second case ,",
    "the soft factor reduces to unity and one recovers the same result as in covariant gauges in which the transverse gauge links are absent .",
