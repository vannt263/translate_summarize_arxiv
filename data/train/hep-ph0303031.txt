    "our knowledge of hadronic structure is based on the hadron spectroscopy and the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data . in the former picture",
    "quarks are massive particles and their bound states describe the static properties of hadrons . on the other hand",
    ", the interpretation of dis data relies upon the quarks of qcd lagrangian with very small mass . the hadronic structure in this picture is intimately connected with the presence of a large number of partons ( quarks and gluons ) .",
    "mass is not the only difference between these two types of quarks ; they also differ in other important properties .",
    "for example , the color charge of quark field in qcd lagrangian is ill - defined and is not gauge invariant , reflecting the color of gluons in an interacting theory ; whereas , color associated with a constituent quark ( cq ) is a well defined entity .",
    "it is shown that @xcite@xcite one can perturbatively dress a qcd lagrangian field to all orders and construct a cq in conformity with the color confinement . from this point of view",
    "a cq is defined as a quasi - particle emerging from the dressing of valence quark with gluons and @xmath5 pairs in qcd .",
    "+ of course , the concept of cq as an intermediate step between the quarks of qcd lagrangian and hadrons is not new .",
    "in fact , altarelli and cabibo @xcite used this concept in the context of @xmath6 .",
    "hwa in his work used the term _",
    "valon_,for them , elaborated on the concept and showed its applications to many physical processes @xcite . in ref.[2 ] it is suggested that the concept of dressed quark and gluon might be useful in the area of jet physics and heavy quark effective theory . despite the ever presence of cq",
    "no one has calculated its content and partonic structure without resorting to hadronic data and the process of deconvolution .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is threefold : ( a ) to evaluate the structure of a cq in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) framework of qcd , ( b ) to verify its conformity with the structure function data of nucleon and pion for which ample data are available , ( c ) to include additional refinments that are needed to account for the violation of gottfried sum rule ( gsr ) and the binding effect of constituent quarks to form a physical hadron .",
    "in this subsection we will utilize the extended work done on the development of the nlo calculations of moments , to calculate the structure of a constituent quark .",
    "what will follow in the rest of this subsection is not a new next - to - leading order calculation .",
    "however , we find it interesting to explore the existing calculations in the valon framework .",
    "+ by definition , a cq is a universal building block for every hadron ; that is , the structure of a cq is common to all hadrons and is generated perturbatively .",
    "once its structure is calculated , it would be possible , in principle , to calculate the structure of any hadron . in doing so",
    ", we will follow the philosophy that in a dis experiment at high enough @xmath7 , it is the structure of a cq which is being probed , and that at sufficiently low value of @xmath7 this structure can not be resolved .",
    "thus , a cq behaves as a valence quark , and a hadron is viewed as the bound state of its constituent quarks . under these criteria , partons of dis experiments",
    "are components of cq .",
    "the structure function of a u - type cq at high @xmath7 can be written as[4 ] : @xmath8 where all the functions on the right - hand side are the probability functions for quarks having momentum fraction @xmath9 of a u - type cq at @xmath7 .",
    "a similar expression can be written for a d - type cq .",
    "following ref . [ 4 ] , we define the singlet ( s ) and nonsinglet ( ns ) components of the cq structure functions as : @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the favored distribution describing the structure function of a quark within a cq of the same flavor , while the unfavored distribution , @xmath13 , describes the structure function of any quark of different flavor within the cq .",
    "we have used , @xmath14 , for the number of active flavors . solving ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", we get , @xmath15 @xmath16 having expressed all the structure functions of a cq in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we now go to the n- moment space and define the moments of these distributions as : @xmath17 @xmath18 where , the subscription @xmath19 stands for s or ns . due to charge symmetry , in the following",
    ", we only write the cq distribution for proton .",
    "+ in the nlo approximation the dependence of the running coupling constant , @xmath20 , on @xmath7 is given by : @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the evolution of parton distributions is controlled by the anomalous dimensions : + @xmath24 @xmath25 + where @xmath26 ; and @xmath27 are one and two loop anomalous dimension matrices .",
    "the nonsinglet moments in the nlo are as follows : @xmath28(\\frac{\\alpha_{s}(q^{2})}{\\alpha_{s}(q_{0}^{2})})^ { \\frac{\\gamma_{qq}^{(0)n}}{2\\beta_{0}}}.\\ ] ] the anomalous dimension matrices , @xmath27,are given by , @xmath29 these matrices , govern the moments of the singlet quark and sector as given by : @xmath30\\}{\\bf{1}}+\\{({\\cal{q}}_{+\\longleftrightarrow -})\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 are one and two - loop anomalous dimension matrices , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 is the unit matrix .",
    "notice that the last term in eq .",
    "( 11 ) , @xmath35 , means that all subscripts are exchanged .",
    "the leading order behavior is obtained from the first term in the square brackets .",
    "@xmath36 denote the eigenvalues of the one - loop anomalous dimension matrix , @xmath32 : @xmath37\\ ] ] these anomalous dimensions and @xmath38 are calculated up to second order in @xmath20 and can be found in @xcite @xcite .",
    "@xmath39 are as follows : @xmath40 in ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , @xmath41 is used to denote the leading order anomalous dimensions ; these are related to @xmath42 by : @xmath43 .",
    "+ in evaluating these moments , we have taken @xmath44 @xmath4 and @xmath45 @xmath46 , as our initial scales .",
    "it seems that evolution of parton distributions from such a low value of @xmath47 is not justified theoretically ; we shall take up this issue shortly in subsection 2.3 .      in the previous subsection we outlined how to calculate the moments .",
    "in this subsection we will give the corresponding parton distributions in a cq .",
    "+ the moments of the cq structure function , @xmath48 , are expressed completely in terms of @xmath7 through the evolution parameter @xmath49 : @xmath50 the moments of valence and sea quarks in a cq are , @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53are given by eqs . ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "it is now straightforward , to evaluate @xmath54 and @xmath55 at any @xmath7 or @xmath49 .",
    "these are calculated numerically for a range of @xmath56 at fixed @xmath7 or @xmath49 . in figure",
    "( 1 ) we present these moments both in the leading and next - to - leading orders . for every value of @xmath49",
    "we fit the moments by a beta function , which in turn is the moment of the parton distribution as given below , @xmath57 @xmath58\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath59,@xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are functions of @xmath7 through the evolution parameter @xmath49 . the same form as in eq . ( 18 ) is obtained for the gluon distribution in a cq , only with different parameter values .",
    "the functional forms of these parameters are polynomials of order three in @xmath49 and are given in the appendix .",
    "the goodness of these we fits are checked by @xmath67 minimization procedure .",
    "we find that , for all parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath68 , of the valence quark sector @xmath69 , with the standard error of order @xmath70 . for the sea quark and gluon sector , @xmath71 carries between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "of course , the forms ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) are not unique ; rather , they are the most simple and commonly used forms .",
    "we note that the sum rule reflecting the fact that each cq contains only one valence quark is satisfied at all values of @xmath7 : @xmath74 substituting these results into eq .",
    "( 1 ) completes the evaluation of cq structure function in nlo . in figure",
    "( 2 ) , we plot various parton distributions inside a cq .",
    "in subsection 2.1 we indicated that our initial scales are @xmath75 @xmath4 and @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "the above value of @xmath76 corresponds to a distance of 0.36 _ fm _ which is roughly equal to or slightly less than the radius of a cq .",
    "it may be objected that such distances are probably too large for a meaningful pure perturbative treatment .",
    "we note that @xmath48 has the property that it becomes @xmath77 as @xmath7 is extrapolated to @xmath78 , which is beyond the region of validity .",
    "this mathematical boundary condition signifies that the internal structure of a cq can not be resolved at @xmath76 in the nlo approximation .",
    "consequently , when this property is applied to eq.(20 ) , below , the structure function of the nucleon becomes directly related to @xmath79 at those values of @xmath76 ; that is , @xmath76 is the leading order effective value at which the hadron can be considered as consisting of only three ( two ) cq , for baryons ( mesons ) .",
    "we have checked that when @xmath7 approaches to @xmath78 the quark moments approach to unity and the moments of gluon approach to zero .",
    "in fact for @xmath80 gluon moments are at the order of @xmath81 and singlet and nonsinglet moments are 0.9992 .",
    "in fact our results are only meaningful for @xmath82 @xmath4 .",
    "+ > from the theoretical standpoint , both @xmath83 and @xmath76 depend on the order of the moments , @xmath56 ; but here , we have assumed that they are independent of @xmath56 . in this way",
    ", we have introduced some degree of approximation to the @xmath7 evolution of the valence and sea quarks .",
    "however , on one hand there are other contributions like target - mass effects , which add uncertainties to the theoretical predictions of perturbative qcd , while on the other hand since we are dealing with the cq , there is no experimental data to invalidate an @xmath56 independent @xmath83 assumption .",
    "so far , the structure of a cq is calculated in the nlo framework . in this section",
    "we will use the convolution method to calculate the structure functions of proton , @xmath84 , and pion .",
    "let us denote the structure function of a cq by @xmath85 and the probability of finding a cq carrying momentum fraction @xmath86 of the hadron by @xmath87 .",
    "the corresponding structure function of a hadron is obtained by convolution of @xmath85 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 where summation runs over the number of cq s in a particular hadron .",
    "we note that @xmath87 is independent of the nature of the probe , and its @xmath7 value . in effect",
    "@xmath87 describes the wave function of hadron in cq representation , containing all the complications due to confinement .",
    "> from the theoretical point of view , this function can not be evaluated accurately . to facilitate phenomenological analysis , following [ 4 ] ,",
    "we assume a simple form for the exclusive cq distribution in proton and pion as follows , @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are normalization parameters . after integrating over unwanted momenta",
    ", we can arrive at the inclusive distribution of individual cq : @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 similar expression for @xmath96 is obtained with the interchange of @xmath97 . in the above equations , @xmath98 is the euler beta function .",
    "the arguments of this function , as well as , @xmath91 and @xmath92 of eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) , are fixed by the number and momentum sum rules : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "numerical values are : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these parameters are independent of @xmath106 and are given in [ 4 ] and @xcite for proton and pion , respectively . in @xcite , a new set of values for @xmath107 and @xmath108 are suggested which differ significantly from the values quoted above .",
    "reference [ 8 ] uses the cteq parton distributions in the next - to - leading order to fix these parameters .",
    "the authors of ref . [ 8 ] have found yet another set of values in @xcite , which differs from those given in [ 4 ] and [ 8 ] .",
    "they attribute these differences to the different theoretical assumptions .",
    "we have tried a range of values for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and checked that the sum rules ( 26 ) are satisfied . because of the beta function in the denominator of eqs.(23 - 25 ) the number sum rule does not change by changing @xmath107 and @xmath108 and we found little sensitivity on the momentum sum rule .",
    "in fact , we have varied both @xmath107 and @xmath108 , randomly in the interval @xmath111 $ ] , and checked it against @xmath112 data .",
    "we found very little sensitivity to the choices made .",
    "for the data that we shall analyze , these two parameter formulas will prove to be adequate .",
    "the differences between parameters of ref . [ 8 ] and ref . [ 4 ] ( which we have adopted ) can be attributed to the different methods of extracting the parameters .",
    "we have calculated the parton distributions from the perturbative qcd , whereas ref.[8 ] have used cteq s global fit to extract parton content of nucleon .",
    "+ the considerations on the form of cq distribution that are used here , does not exclude other possibilities .",
    "however , in our model the quark distribution , say , in a proton is described as the convolution of the cq distribution , @xmath113 , and the quark distribution in the cq .",
    "in the moment form the latter two become the product of their moments .",
    "mathematically , these two moments can be modified without changing the product .",
    "that would , of course , modify the original @xmath113 and parton distribution in a cq .",
    "but the parton distribution has a definite meaning .",
    "it is the evolution of a quark as @xmath114 increases . at @xmath115 ,",
    "parton distribution is a delta function , implying that the cq has no internal structure that can be probed .",
    "our model is to say that the three valence quark at high @xmath114 becomes three cq s at low @xmath114 without anything else .",
    "such a physical statement of the model does not permit to redefine @xmath113 or the parton distribution in a cq , although mathematical criticism still remains . +",
    "our choice of @xmath113 is sufficient to fit all the data of deep inelastic scattering in the range of interest .",
    "it does not mean that a more complicated @xmath113 is ruled out .",
    "it is a subject that can be revisited in the future when problem arise . at this point",
    "our formula for the cq distribution is satisfactory .",
    "a comment regarding the moments is in order : the definition of the moments are not arbitrary if we are to attach physical interpretation to the constituent quark distribution .",
    "there are only two u and one d in a proton , which impose constrains on the first moment .",
    "also , the sum of the cq momenta should be one , which imposes a constraint on the second moment .",
    "if one writes the valence quark moments as a product of @xmath116 and @xmath117 then @xmath117 must have connection with qcd evolution to ensure that there is only one valence quark in every cq and hence , the constraint becomes @xmath118 with these constrains , one can not freely redefine moments of cq distribution , @xmath117 and @xmath119 . yet",
    ", there are infinite number of cq moments and we have cited only two constraints . does this leave an infinite horde number of undefined quantities ?",
    "the higher moments of the cq distribution are affected mainly by the large @xmath120 behavior of proton wave function , or will affect only the even larger @xmath120 behavior of the parton distribution . until one focuses on that region and finds inconsistency ,",
    "one chooses the simplest parameterization .",
    "there are similar situations both in classical and contemporary physics .",
    "the question can be turned around and asked why did newton stop at @xmath121 law for gravitational force ? could he have excluded the possible existence of @xmath122 terms with @xmath123 ? by only citing the existence of two constraints ,",
    "newton avoided confronting the infinite horde of undefined quantities .",
    "our model is inductive physics .",
    "valons or cq s are not derived by deductive logic from the first principles . in modeling",
    ", one finds the simplest way to capture the essence of the physics involved .",
    "the situation is also present in contemporary physics : we could have asked why the cornell potential for the bound - state problem of quark and antiquark does not contain all possible power law terms beside the @xmath124 and the @xmath125 terms .",
    "the answer is simple : it is what fits the particle mass spectrum that counts , again in the simplest way possible that captures the essence of the problem .",
    "+      having specified the parton distributions in the cq and the constituent quark distribution in proton and pion , it is possible to determine various parton distributions in any hadron . for proton ,",
    "we get : @xmath126 @xmath127 the above equations represent the contribution of constituent quarks to the sea and the valence quark distributions in proton . in figure",
    "( 3 ) , the cq contribution to parton distributions in @xmath128 and @xmath129 is shown .",
    "comparing with proton structure function data , shows that the results fall short of representing the experimental data by a few percent ( @xmath130-@xmath131 , depending on @xmath7 and @xmath120 ) .",
    "this is not surprising , for it is a well established fact that there are soft gluons in the nucleon .",
    "we attribute their presence to the fact that constituent quarks are not free in a hadron , but interact with each other to form the bound states . at each @xmath7 value",
    "we have computed the soft gluon contribution using direct comparison with experimental data .",
    "the final result is parameterized as : @xmath132 where , @xmath133 . in figure",
    "( 4 ) , the shape of @xmath134 is presented for a range of @xmath7 values .",
    "splitting of these gluons could in turn produce @xmath135 pairs which can combine with the original constituent quarks and fluctuate the baryonic state to a meson - baryon state .",
    "this also will break the @xmath1 symmetry of the sea as we shall see next .",
    "+      in our model there is no room in the cq structure for the breaking of @xmath1 symmetry of the nucleon sea .",
    "but , after creation of @xmath136 pair by the soft gluons , these quarks can recombine with cq to fluctuate into meson - nucleon state which breaks the symmetry of the nucleon sea . in what follows",
    "we will compute this component , and its contribution to the nucleon structure function , and its relevance to the violation of the gottfried sum rule .",
    "we will follow the prescription of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the above proposed model , is similar to the effective chiral quark theory , in which the relevant degrees of freedom are constituent quarks , gluons and goldstone bosons .",
    "the coupling of pions produces pion cloud of the constituent quark , in which we are interested .",
    "the point we would like to make is that , there are two types of sea quark and gluon that contribute to the nucleon sea measured in dis .",
    "one type is generated from qcd hard bremsstrahlung and gluon splitting .",
    "this component is discussed in subsection 2.2 and is associated with the internal composition of the constituent quark rather than the proton itself .",
    "the other contribution is generated nonperturbatively via meson - baryon fluctuation . as we will show",
    ", according to our results , this component provides a consistent framework to understand the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea .",
    "it also compensates for the shortcoming of perturbatively generated parton densities in reproducing the experimental data on @xmath112 . in order to distinguish these partons from those confined inside the cq",
    ", we will term them as _ inherent _ partons .",
    "this component is intimately related to the bound state problem , and hence it has a non - perturbative origin . however , for the process of @xmath137 , at an initial value of @xmath138 where @xmath20 is still small enough , we will calculate it perturbatively .",
    "the corresponding splitting functions are as follows , @xmath139 @xmath140 for the joint probability distribution of the process at hand , we get , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the inherent parton density .",
    "the splitting functions , and the @xmath143 , are those of the leading order , rather than nlo .",
    "we do not expect that this approximation will affect the whole structure function , as can be seen from figure ( 5 ) . in the above equation @xmath144 ,",
    "is a factor depending on @xmath7 , and @xmath145 is the constituent quark distribution in the proton as given previously . the same process , can also be a source of @xmath1 symmetry breaking of nucleon sea ; namely , @xmath146 , and hence , the violation of the gottfried sum rule ( gsr ) .",
    "we will take up this issue in the next subsection .",
    "+ the process is depicted in figure ( 6 ) .",
    "probability to form a meson - baryon state can be written as in ref . [ 11 ] , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the joint probability of finding a cq with momentum fraction @xmath86 , and an inherent quark or anti - quark of momentum fraction @xmath9 in the proton .",
