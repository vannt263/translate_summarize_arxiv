    "serre , at the beginning of the fifties , introduced the idea of using the cohomology of loop spaces in topology .",
    "topologists have quickly studied the cohomology of iterated loop spaces @xmath4 which are spaces of maps @xmath5 on spheres @xmath6 .",
    "the computation of the cohomology of @xmath4 would make possible the determination of homotopy classes of these maps @xmath5 but , for the moment , this computation is well understood only when @xmath7 is the @xmath0-fold suspension of a space @xmath8 . besides",
    ", we have a comprehensive knowledge of the homotopy classes of finite cell complexes in a few particular cases only ( which do not include spheres ) for which the homotopy vanishes in dimension @xmath9 .",
    "our works @xcite give an algebraic device to model iterated loop spaces @xmath4 on all spaces @xmath7 and for every value of @xmath0 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explain how to make explicit a structured complex computing the cohomology of a profinite completion of the iterated loop spaces @xmath10 from this model , by putting together results of  @xcite and of another article  @xcite .",
    "the obtained complex is defined purely algebraically , in terms of the internal structure of certain operads , and inherits nice operadic structures from which we hope to get information of new nature on the topology of @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath2-operads give the core structures of our construction .",
    "for our purpose , we consider @xmath2-operads in the category of differential graded modules ( dg - modules for short ) and we use the noun @xmath2-algebra to refer to any category of algebras associated to an @xmath2-operad in that ambient category . in that context , the @xmath2-operads refer to the homotopy type of operads which are weakly equivalent to the chain operad of boardman - vogt little @xmath0-cubes .",
    "most models of @xmath2-operads come in nested sequences @xmath11 such that @xmath12 is an @xmath13 operad , an operad weakly equivalent to the operad @xmath14 of associative and commutative algebras .",
    "the @xmath15-operads , which form the initial terms of nested sequences of the form ( * ) , are weakly equivalent to the operad @xmath16 of associative non - commutative algebras .",
    "intuitively , an @xmath15-algebra structure is interpreted as a structure which is homotopy associative in the strong sense but non - commutative , while an @xmath17-algebra is fully homotopy ( associative and ) commutative .",
    "the @xmath2-algebra structures , which are intermediate between @xmath15 and @xmath17 , are interpreted as structures which are homotopy associative in the strong sense and homotopy commutative up to some degree .",
    "a commutative algebra naturally inherits an @xmath2-algebra structure , for all @xmath18 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "a space means a simplicial set and we associate to a simplicial set @xmath7 the standard normalized complex @xmath19 with coefficients in the ground ring @xmath20 of our base category of dg - modules . as we deal with pointed spaces , we use the reduced complex @xmath21 in our constructions rather than the whole complex @xmath19 . to handle structures without unit ( like these reduced complexes @xmath22 )",
    ", we also remove @xmath23-ary operations from our operads .",
    "the cochain algebras @xmath22 inherit an @xmath17-algebra structure by  @xcite , for which we have an explicit construction ( see  @xcite ) giving an action of certain @xmath17-operads equipped with a filtration of the form ( * ) on @xmath22 . in that context , we immediately see that the @xmath17-algebra @xmath22 inherits an @xmath2-algebra structure for all @xmath0 .",
    "now a natural homology theory @xmath24 is associated to any category of algebras over an @xmath2-operad . for a cochain algebra @xmath25 ,",
    "the theorems of  @xcite , put together , imply that the homology @xmath26 determines the cohomology of a profinite completion of the @xmath0-fold loop space @xmath4 .",
    "but we observe in  @xcite that @xmath2-operads are in a sense koszul and we prove , using a good @xmath2-operad @xmath27 , that a cofibrant model of @xmath2-operad is yielded by an operadic cobar construction @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an operadic desuspension of the dual cooperad of @xmath27 in dg - modules .",
    "this result implies that the homology @xmath24 of any @xmath27-algebra can be computed by a nice structured complex of the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the connected @xmath32-cofree coalgebra on  @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a twisting coderivation determined by the @xmath2-algebra structure of  @xmath33 ( this construction is reviewed in   [ koszuldualityreview ] ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine the differential of this complex @xmath35 for the cochain algebra of a sphere @xmath36 , where @xmath37 . in  @xcite",
    ", we observe that the action of  @xmath28 on @xmath38 , by way of the morphism @xmath39 , is determined by a composite of :    1 .",

    "the existence of a morphism @xmath44 reflects the existence of a restriction functor from @xmath46-algebras to @xmath3-algebras and has been used in the literature in the case @xmath47 , in conjunction with the deligne conjecture , to determine the homotopy type of certain deformation complexes ( see for instance  @xcite ) . in  @xcite",
    ", we prove that these morphisms @xmath48 are unique up to a right homotopy in the category of operads , and hence , are characteristic of the structure of an @xmath46-operad .",
    "we give a conceptual definition of the complex @xmath49 in terms of the embedding @xmath42 , of the morphism @xmath44 and of the composition structure of the operad @xmath27 .",
    "we will obtain a result of a particularly simple form also because the reduced normalized complex @xmath38 is a free @xmath20-module of rank one .",
    "we give all details in   [ spherekoszulduality ] .",
    "for this introduction , we are simply going to state the final outcome of our construction : the application of our result to iterated loop space cohomology as it arises from  @xcite .",
    "we dualize the construction to ease the formulation of our result .",
    "we form , for any @xmath50 , the free complete @xmath27-algebra @xmath51 on one generator @xmath52 of degree  @xmath53 .",
    "the elements of this algebra  @xmath54 are just formal power series @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an @xmath57-ary operation of the operad @xmath58 .",
    "our result makes appear a composition product @xmath59 , borrowed to  @xcite , defined termwise by sums of operadic substitution operations @xmath60 running over all entries of @xmath61 .",
    "we observe that the existence of a morphism @xmath62 is formally equivalent to the existence of an element @xmath63 , of degree @xmath64 , satisfying the relation @xmath65 , where @xmath66 refers to the canonical differential of @xmath54 .",
    "we embed this element @xmath67 into @xmath51 , for any @xmath50 .",
    "we have then :    we consider the twisted complex @xmath68 defined by adding the map @xmath69 to the natural differential of the free complete @xmath27-algebra @xmath51 . when the ground ring is @xmath70 , we have an identity @xmath71 between the continuous cohomology of the profinite completion of @xmath10 and the homology of the dual complex of @xmath68 in @xmath70-modules ( we take the continuous dual with respect to the topology of power series ) .",
    "the profinite completion of the theorem is defined by the limit of a diagram @xmath72 where @xmath73 ranges over homotopy finite approximations of @xmath74 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this formulation is slightly abusive because the profinite completion of @xmath10 would be the limit of a diagram of homotopy finite approximations of the space @xmath10 itself .",
    "nevertheless results of  @xcite imply that these limits coincide .",
    "the theorem has an @xmath75-version where the profinite completion of @xmath10 is replaced by a @xmath76-profinite approximation , the limit of a diagram @xmath72 where @xmath73 now ranges over homotopy @xmath76-finite approximations of @xmath74 ( see again  @xcite ) .",
    "the topological results of  @xcite are stated in the @xmath75-setting , but the arguments work same over @xmath70 .",
    "the above theorem is not intended for computational purposes and we should not undertake any computation with it ",
    "the iterated bar complexes of  @xcite , which are equipped with nice filtrations , seem better suited for such an undertaking .",
    "the actual goal of this article , with this theorem , is to make explicit the connection between the cohomology of iterated loop spaces of spheres and the homotopical structures of @xmath2-operads . in subsequent work",
    ", we plan to apply the theorem to gain qualitative information on the structure of iterated loop space cohomology by using connections , explained in  @xcite , between @xmath2-operads and quantum field theory .    in   [ koszuldualityreview ] , we briefly review the definition of the homology @xmath77 associated to an operad @xmath78 , the applications of the bar duality of operads to the definition of complexes @xmath79 computing @xmath77 , and we explain how to apply this construction to @xmath2-operads with the result of  @xcite . in   [ freecompletealgebras ] , we explain the definition of the free complete algebras of the form @xmath51 and their duality connection with cofree coalgebras @xmath80 on a dg - module @xmath81 of rank one . in   [ spherekoszulduality ] , we study the applications of operadic bar duality to the cochain algebra of spheres @xmath38 and we determine the form of the complex @xmath49 from which we obtain the outcome of our theorem .    in   [ koszuldualityreview ] and  [ spherekoszulduality ] , we deal with a particular @xmath2-operad , already used in the proof of  @xcite , which arises from a certain filtration of an @xmath17-operad introduced by barratt - eccles in  @xcite . in",

    "to begin with , we review the background of our constructions .",
    "we are only going to give a brief survey of this background since our main purpose is to explain our conventions .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a more detailed account with the same overall conventions as in the present article .    to begin with ,",
