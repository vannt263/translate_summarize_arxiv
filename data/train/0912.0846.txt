    "circumstellar disks are a natural outcome of the star - formation process : when a molecular cloud core collapses , it gives rise to a central star surrounded by a rotating circumstellar disk , which transports material towards the star . over time",
    ", the disk material dissipates through processes such as accretion onto the central star , disk winds and the formation of planets . at an age of @xmath2 ,",
    "about 90% of disks have already dispersed , and within @xmath3 of their formation , almost all pre - main - sequence stars are diskless ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while it is now believed that such disks commonly give rise to planetary systems , the details of this process remain unclear",
    "theory predicts that disks evolve from the inside out : dust grain growth is expected to occur faster in the inner disk than in the outer disk , higher densities favor planet formation in the inner disk @xcite , and photoevaporation by the central star will cause the inner disk to dissipate first @xcite .",
    "possible observational support for inside out disk evolution has been found in a small number of so - called transitional disks .",
    "these systems show a strong mid - infrared excess ( @xmath4 ) revealing the presence of dust but significantly reduced or no shorter wavelength infrared excess compared to typical classical t tauri disks , indicating a depletion of optically thick inner dust out to a radius of a few au @xcite .",
    "therefore , these disks might be in the process of dispersing and this has often been assumed to be due to the influence of newly formed planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "discussed explanations of the transitional disk phenomenon reveal two important features which can be tested directly by high angular resolution imaging observations .",
    "\\(1 ) the depletion of dust inside of the outer , mid - infrared disk , could be caused by a close ( au - scale ) binary system inside of the disk .",
    "binary companions can perturb a circumstellar disk and create inner holes with diameters comparable to the binary separation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also the discussion for di  tau in meyer et al .",
    "1997 ) . to call such a circumbinary disk _ transitional _ , would be misleading , since circumbinary disks can be dynamically stable and longer - lasting than the short ( @xmath5  myr ) time - scales derived from the small ( few percent ) fractional abundance of transitional disks around pre - main - sequence stars in nearby , a few myr young , star - forming regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* note that the fractional abundancies of transitional disks might be as high as a few tens of percent , depending on the exact definition of transitional disks , in particular if and what type of residual inner disk emission is permitted ) .",
    "also , a close companion affects the sed interpretation of apparent transitional disk systems .",
    "unresolved infrared companions can create additional near - infrared and , if embedded , mid - infrared flux , that appears comparable to the infrared excess radiation seen in transitional disk systems , which typically is interpreted as disk emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , recent diffraction limited nir imaging with the keck ii telescope of the candidate transitional disk system indicates that its inner hole ( 10  au radius ) is actually caused by a newly discovered binary companion of @xmath6 separation , removing the need to invoke other processes like planet formation as the disk clearing mechanism in transitional disk systems @xcite .",
    "while the census of very close companions of t  tauri stars ( tts ) in star - forming regions is far from complete , the companion star fraction in young , nearby star - forming regions is about 50% in the 15 - 1800  au separation range and @xmath7 at separations less than 10  au .",
    "the companion star fraction typically decreases towards smaller separations ( less than a few au ) , but suggest that ysos in ophiuchus have a companion fraction of at least 10% at the 0.8 - 4  au separation scale .",
    "these observational constraints suggest that there would be enough binaries to populate a large fraction of transitional disks , although the short - period binary frequency appears to vary between different sites of star formation .",
    "( 2 ) while some transitional disks may be completely cleared of material in the inner region , the planet formation hypothesis suggests that disk clearing may often result in gaps between inner and outer dusty regions .",
    "other possible disk clearing mechanisms such as photoevaporation would produce strictly inside - out clearing @xcite , so evidence for gaps in disks ( in contrast to totally cleared holes ) tends to support the planet formation hypothesis .",
    "many transitional disks show some infrared excess emission inside of the outer optically thick disk , which itself dominates at wavelengths longer than @xmath8 m .",
    "it has been shown for a few systems that this near - infrared excess can be explained by a small amount of emitting dust close to the star at @xmath9au - scales , leaving a gap between this innermost dust , and the outer mid - infrared disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the near - infrared excess in transitional disk systems might origin from such small size scales , if not emitted by a so far unresolved companion ( case 1 ) .",
    "to directly assess ( 1 ) the presence of close binary companions within transitional disks and ( 2 ) the emission size scale of the near - infrared excess over the stellar continuum , we used the keck interferometer ( ki ) in @xmath10 mode - mode measures the continuum squared visibility amplitude of the astronomical @xmath11-band ] to observe 5 transitional disks in the nearby ( @xmath1  140  pc ) taurus - auriga young star - forming region .",
    "the nominal interferometric resolution of @xmath12  mas and the field of view of @xmath13 , offered in the @xmath10 mode , is well suited to resolve any companion stars from about 0.5 to 5  au distance from the target primary stars .",
    "this angular resolution is a significant improvement over the resolution available with speckle or aperture mask interferometry and adaptive optics at 8 - 10  m class telescopes ( @xmath14  25  mas ) .",

    "dm  tau is the only object in our sample with no detectable excess emission below 8  @xmath43 m , but it is still accreting , traced by hydrogen emission lines .",
    "this suggests that at least gas must exist in the innermost disk , feeding the accretion .",
    "gm  aur has a hole of 24  au , which is partially filled with optically thin dust .",
    "both lkca  15 and ux  tau  a seem to have gaps between optically thick inner and outer disk regions ; in addition , lkca  15 also has some optically thin dust in the gap .",
    "ry  tau could be a transitional disk with a gap , in part due to its somewhat similar sed shape to lkca  15 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ry tau has an earlier spectral type than the rest of the sample , and therefore its disk structure could be different .",
    "our data probe binary separations of 2.5 - 30  mas ( 0.35 - 4  au ) .",
    "this matches the inner region , which can not be resolved by single telescope imaging of 8 - 10  m class telescopes , and which lies inside the colder optically thick dust disks , responsible for the mir - excess of transitional disks ( see @xmath45 in table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , this region covers the range where a stellar companion might reside and be responsible for inner disk truncation or nir excess flux .",
    "a circumbinary disk is typically truncated at an inner radius of about 2 - 3 times the semi - major axis of the binary .",
    "@xcite investigated the gravitational impact of a central binary on a geometrically thin , non - self gravitating circumbinary disk , and found that the semi - major axis of the central binary is about half the inner disk edge - radius .",
    "the detailed relation between binary separation and disk hole size depends on the binary s eccentricity .",
    "our interferometric approach is sensitive to companions with orbital periods ranging from several months to several years , a regime that could also be probed by radial velocity surveys .",
    "however , such surveys would take years to complete , as opposed to a single epoch of ki observations .",
    "earth s rotation of the ki baseline allows us to obtain visibilities at about 5 independent _ spatial frequencies _ ( or _ u , v_-points ) per object per night , which suffices to exclude a large number of binary parameters . for some of our targets , we are able to combine our data with previous interferometric measurements ; ry tau : @xcite , lkca  15 , gm  aur : @xcite .",
    "the earlier measurements of these objects visibility amplitudes indicate that they are spatially resolved and were modeled as inner disk structure in each case .",
    "however , those single visibility measurements of lkca  15 and gm  aur are insufficient to distinguish such disk structure from a companion star .",

    "good seeing , we did not follow up each target with a calibrator immediately , but rather alternated two targets with one visibility calibrator measurement .",
    "we used several different calibrator sources throughout the night to enable cross calibration , and to match the targets in brightness within @xmath65 to minimize the impact of the known flux - dependence of the ki system visibility .",
    "flux bias calibration of the visibilities was applied , which has been shown to push the systematic @xmath10 calibration errors from @xmath66 down to @xmath67   .",
    "the calibrators were selected using either the getcal planning tool or browsing simbad directly within a radius of @xmath68 around the science targets .",
    "we only used stars from the hipparcos and tycho catalogs to assure high coordinate precision . to ensure that all calibrator stars are unresolved with respect to the projected baseline , their photospheric diameters were estimated by fitting black - body seds to published photometry using nexsci s fbol routine ( table  [ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "the fitted black - body model was compared in particular to the photometry at wavelengths longer than 2  @xmath69 to check for dust excess that would be indicative of extended structure .",
    "our data reduction followed the standard procedures developed and suggested by the nexsci team , and we made ample use of their wb / nbcalib - software suite and the respective documentation .",
    "the individual transfer functions , derived from each calibrator measurement , are defined as the ratio of the measured raw squared visibility to the respective ideal uniform disk squared visibility .",
    "then , a time and sky - location dependent average system transfer function is calculated , which picks for each target the calibrators closer than 15@xmath64 and observed within two hours before or after the target measurement .",

    "this calculation of an average transfer function , based on all calibrator measurements , is particularly suitable for nights with stable observing conditions .",
    "finally the raw data are divided by the transfer function to calculate the calibrated visibilities .",
    "we use the standard deviation of the raw measurements as a first estimate of the uncertainties of each data point .",
    "the resulting statistical visibility uncertainties of the individual measurements are @xmath70 in most cases , smaller than the canonical value of 0.03 ( see the nexsci ki support websites ) , which includes margin for systematics such as slightly different observing conditions and strehl between the calibrator and science measurements .",
    "the calibrated visibility measurements appear in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "although the observing conditions were very good and stable throughout the night , and the calibration uncertainty seems to be slightly better , we assume the standard @xmath71 for the analysis in this paper . to get the highest precision , it is recommended to bracket a science object with two calibrator measurements at similar flux levels which would give a slightly better time - sampling of the system visibility than ours .",
    "however , since our goal was to detect visibility changes of 0.2 over the observed range in hour angles , our conclusions do not depend on the precise uncertainty adopted .",
    "higher observing efficiency ( i.e. time sampling ) of the targets is more critical for our project than highest calibration precision , to sample as large a range of binary parameters as possible .",

    "we added previously published ki data points for gm  aur and lkca  15 . for , we also included in our analysis visibility measurements from a previous observation with the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "due to the different baselines of the pti measurements ( see footnote ( @xmath74 ) in table  [ tab:4 ] ) , in particular different position angles at similar baseline lengths , we do not show those data together with our ki data in fig .",

    "thus , we can test our visibility data for each target against two contrary scenarios :    1 .",
    "a binary companion is present , responsible both for clearing out the optically thick dust from the inner region of the disk , and for producing some or all of the observed near infrared excesses . in the following section , we demonstrate that a large range of binary parameters in the range of dynamical interaction between the binary and the inner disk edge can be excluded on basis of our ki data .",
    "2 .   as an alternative to the binary scenario ,",
    "we evaluate a simple model of a disk gap , simulating the inner dust disk by a face - on circumstellar ring which contributes to the @xmath78-band flux .",
    "the diameter estimates of such a pragmatic model approach give order - of - magnitude constraints on the location and extension of the observed emission .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we mostly sample a range of similar projected baseline lengths ( 75    85  m ) .",
    "therefore , we can not firmly conclude from the visibility data alone whether we resolve or over - resolve the dust emission .",
    "while resolved emission would result in decreasing visibilities with longer baselines , an over - resolved emission would show constant visibilities below unity .",
    "more information , for instance about the @xmath78-band excess from the sed models , is needed to interpret the data best . here , we aim at understanding at an order of magnitude level the physical location of the extended emission .",
    "thus , details like scattered light contributions have not been considered in our analysis @xcite .",
    "our overall approach is to test binary models against the observed visibilities , in order to estimate the parts of the parameter space that are incompatible with the data . due to the high maximum elevation of the taurus - auriga star forming region at mauna kea ,",
    "the single baseline of the ki delivers sufficient _ u , v_-coverage to probe a large range of binary parameters .",
    "we calculated theoretical visibilities for all position angles ( @xmath79 ) from @xmath80 ( the visibility sensitivity is point - symmetric ) , star - star separations @xmath81 between 2.5 and 30  mas , and flux ratios ( @xmath82 ) between 1 and 0.05 times the brightness of the primary . for each model the reduced @xmath83 deviation to the data was calculated . because the number of observed data points differ for each source ( and thus the number of degrees of freedom for our model also varies ) we calculate individually for each source the @xmath83 level that corresponds to a formal 99.7  % confidence level for the relevant number of degrees of freedom , based on the cumulative @xmath83-distribution of random measurements .",
    "the 99.7  % confidence limit is arbitrarily chosen to match the 3  @xmath84 confidence level of a normal probability density function .",
    "models whose ( reduced ) @xmath83 exceeds this threshold have a probability of less than 0.3% to be consistent with the data and are rejected .",
    "modeling assumes errors that are statistically independent , when in fact calibration systematics result in correlated errors , slightly modifying the derived probability levels .",
    "we do not attempt to model this in detail , but our choice of a conservative estimate of 0.03 for the errors including such calibration systematics implies that true rejection confidence levels are most likely more stringent than the formal 99.7% level . ] the thresholds are reported in table  [ tab:2 ] .",

    "the field of view ( fov ) of our binary analysis is the 2.5  -  30  mas radius annulur patch of sky around each central star , marked in the plots .",
    "the slight extension of the inner boundary of the fov , orthogonal to the ki - baseline , reflects the shape and binary sensitivity of the point spread function of visibility datasets , based on one baseline . at each point in the fov ,",
    "we plot color - coded the _ brightest _ companion flux ratio allowed for a companion at that location .",
    "for instance , the blue spots in the plot of dm  tau indicate where we found binary solutions with a flux ratio close to unity .",
    "the bright companion solutions are all grouped around a @xmath79 of about @xmath86 .",
    "this is quantified in the position angle histograms of the solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig:82 ] . at a confidence level of 67  % , this is true down to a @xmath82 of 0.05 ( fig .",

    ", we typically rule out more than 99  % of the probed fov . in table",
    "[ tab:2 ] , we report the fraction of the fov without binary solutions . although we can not rule out completely the probed binary parameter range for dm  tau , gm  aur , lkca  15 , and ux  tau  a individually , we can strongly rule out the possibility that the majority of our target stars are binaries .",
    "for instance , if two ( three ) of these stars are binaries , the probability that the two ( three ) binaries would have position angles aligned with @xmath87 is about 3  % ( 0.4  % ) only . where n is the number of binaries out of our five targets , and ( 5-n)/5 is the probability to chose one of the single stars for the pti observations .",
    "] this statistical argument is further strengthened by a similar baseline - dependent constraint of the solutions to separations of multiples of the ki resolution only .",
    "thus , at the 99.7  % ( 67  % ) confidence level of rejecting binary models , it is very unlikely that more than one out of our five targets have a binary companion of 0.08 ( 0.05 ) brightness of the primary .",
    "the masses that such flux limits represent depend on both the luminosity of the primary and the assumed age of the system .",
    "based on the pms evolutionary tracks of @xcite and an age of 1  myr , flux ratios of 0.1 would refer to companion masses of about 1/4 of the primary mass .",
    "the fact that we can rule out binaries for the major part of the tested fov , and for a brightness ratio down to 0.05 is mostly related to the measured small _ differential _ visibility variations .",
    "in contrast , the _ absolute _ level constrains binary parameters to a lesser extent only , but is rather linked to the amount of ( over-)resolved emission .",
    "an equal brightness binary would result in large ( @xmath88 ) squared visibility variations over the probed range of spatial frequencies of the ki baseline .",
    "this amplitude of the visibility variation decreases with decreasing companion brightness ( see the left panels in fig .",
    "[ fig:80 ] ) .",
    "our binary search is limited to @xmath89 because even lower @xmath82 would result in differential visibility variations compatible with models of a single resolved , extended emission structure , as discussed in the next section .",
    "fitting binary models to such data of low differential visibility variation is very ambiguous .",
    "the visibilities of gm aur show a statistically significant differential visibility signal of @xmath90 , different from the other four targets , but our analysis shows that this still small change in visibility does not appreciably alter the range of allowed binary solutions .",
    "we discuss this visibility trend further below in sect .  [ sec:111 ] .",
    "the set of binary parameters , excluded by our data , does not significantly depend on the fact that so far we probed the data against simple , dust - free binary models only .",
    "it is possible that some extended , circumbinary dust emission has been resolved out by the interferometer , resulting in the visibilities below unity .",
    "this raises the concern that the putative binary signature in the visibility variation is not recovered by the analysis because the absolute visibility level has changed with respect to the calculated one , due to the missing over - resolved dust emission in the correlated flux . to probe",
    "if this scenario would have an effect on the findings of the above binary analysis , we simulate the contribution of over - resolved dust emission by dividing the measured visibilities by their maximum .",
    "then , the same binary analysis can be applied to the modified data set .",
    "the results are very similar .",
    "binarity of ry  tau is still ruled out within the searched parameter range , due to the large @xmath47-coverage of the combined ki & pti data .",
    "the modified visibilities of dm  tau , gm  aur , and lkca  15 are now all close to unity , and thus are similar to the originally measured data of ux  tau  a. therefore the same argument holds as above .",
    "binary solutions along the ki baseline position angle can not be ruled out completely , but it is very improbable that all targets harbor a similarly oriented binary .",
    "summarizing , our observations    *   are sensitive to binary companions with flux ratios comparable to the near - ir excess fraction observed for these sources * exclude almost all of the probed binary parameter range , down to companion flux ratios of 0.05 and 2.5  mas ( 3.5  au ) separations * reject stellar binarity as the dominant mechanism in creating a transitional disk appearance     @xcite searched with @xmath78-band keck aperture masking interferometry for inner binaries in dm  tau , gm  aur , lkca  15 , and ux  tau  a , and excluded companions with mass ratios @xmath91 over @xmath92 separation range .",
    "thus , we extend this search at similar sensitivity down to 2.5  mas due to the superior resolution of the ki baseline .      for all targets but dm  tau , previous sed and high resolution studies concluded that significantly more than 5% of the @xmath78-band flux is not emitted by the central stellar object but rather is expected to come from some kind of circumstellar material ( see also our individual target discussions below , and the references therein ) . in the following , we focus on analyzing the geometric constraints derived from the interferometric data .",
    "we do not aim at differentiating between candidates for this emission .",
    "therefore , we simply speak of hot dust as emitter , keeping in mind that other flux contributions from circumstellar gas and scattering of stellar flux are possible as well .    as we have established in the previous section",
    ", we can exclude nearly all possible explanations which invoke a binary companion with flux ratio @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , the fact that we resolve all targets with the interferometer indicates a significant @xmath78-band flux contribution from extended hot circumstellar matter .",
    "thus it appears to be rather unlikely that the inner regions of these transitional disks are totally clear of dust . instead , a gap must separate the innermost hot dust ( visible at @xmath94 ) from the cooler dust which dominates the sed at wavelengths longer than about 8  @xmath95 .",
    "this correlates well with the fact that all our targets have been classified as _",
    "classical _ ttauri stars , with indications for ongoing mass accretion , which requires mass to be located close to the star .",
    "if there _ is _ circumstellar dust radiating at 2  @xmath95 , the expected 3d - morphology is a ring at distances where the dust grain equilibrium temperature is comparable to sublimation temperatures of 1000 - 1500  @xmath78 .",
    "since our observations are limited to the @xmath78-band ( at about 2  @xmath43 m ) , we are not sensitive to cooler dust outside of a few au .",
    "the limited _ u , v_-coverage inhibits a model - free interpretation of the visibility data , but without many additional assumptions , we can evaluate the following simple disk scenario , chosen to minimize the number of model parameters .",
    "we fit to our data a central point source plus a face - on , centro - symmetric , narrow ring , leaving only two degrees of freedom : the flux ratio between star and ring , and the ring radius .",
    "if , in fact , the simple model is reasonably close to the astrophysical reality , the fitted radii would represent the approximate , order of magnitude , location of the radiating material .",
    "only if the emission morphology departed significantly from circular symmetry ( jet - like , edge - on disk ) , the radii derived here would be less meaningful .",
    "fitting more realistic _",
    "inclined _ rings or disks would add at least two more parameters ( position and inclination angles ) , and would essentially require measurements of an orthogonal baseline to obtain good constraints .",

    "details for the individual targets are given in the following sections , but here we summarize the findings qualitatively .    * our data typically require a minimum flux contribution from the inner disk .",
    "since this is @xmath78-band flux , it can not come from very large radii , where cooler dust resides ( peaking at longer wavelengths ) .",

    "the strength of the silicate feature varies between targets , and in particular ux  tau  a shows very weak silicate emission , potentially due to larger grains in the inner disk from grain growth during disk evolution .",

    "a combined mm / nir modeling approach might be worthwhile but bears some caveats .",

    "given the increased disk dominance , a trend of the visibility versus hour angle should be stronger in lkca  15 , if the orientation angles are comparable . however , we do not observe such a trend within our uncertainties , which might be due to a combination of the interpretation caveats given in the previous section .",
    "based on near infrared spectroscopy , @xcite found that lkca 15 has a gap between inner and outer optically thick dust , placing it as a member of the so - called pre - transitional disks .",
    "such sed - models suggest that lkca 15 s optically thick inner disk is located between 0.12 and 0.15 au @xcite .",

    "indeed , our best - fit ring radius is @xmath107 mas = @xmath108 au .",
    "note that the fact that our radius is slightly below the sed model estimation might be due to modelling an inclined inner disk ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) with a face - on ring .",

    "this roughly agrees with the numbers from the sed models , given the order - of - magnitude quality of our face - on ring models .",
    "in particular , the radius solutions of our circular ring model are likely slightly too small due the 60  @xmath64 inclination of the system @xcite .      in ry  tau ,",
    "the nir excess over the photospheric radiation is much more prominent than in the other targets .",

    "its visibilities are much lower than any other target ( mean @xmath109 ) , confirming that in the @xmath78 band , this system s light is dominated by the extended disk .",
    "for ry  tau we took only three new ki data points , and added them to the measurements of an earlier pti experiment @xcite .",

    "this most likely suggests that we have moved beyond the applicability of our simplistic face - on ring model . due to the addition of the pti baselines , we are sensitive to the inclination of ry  tau . @xcite",
    "estimated an inclination of @xmath110 degrees for a ring model , consistent with our data .",
    "our inferred ring radius of @xmath111 agrees with the earlier findings within the uncertainties .",
    "note that @xcite reports a spectro - photometric model fit for ry  tau with a high disk inclination , which is not supported by the interferometric data ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "this demonstrates the ambiguity of such model fits without including high angular resolution imaging data .",
    "as noted above , recent high - resolution aperture - masking by @xcite has revealed that the supposedly transitional disk around coku  tau/4 is instead a circumbinary disk around a near - equal flux binary with a ( projected ) star - star separation of 53  mas .",
    "thus , there is no need to invoke planet formation to produce its inferred disk clearing within @xmath112 au .",
    "but for all other known and well - studied transitional disks in taurus , we have probed the binary separation range that could be responsible for creating the inner holes implied by the target seds , and concluded that the interferometric data rule out binarity as the predominant cause for the lack of hot dust emission in these systems .",
    "coku  tau/4 appears to be the exception , not the rule .",

    "this matches with the theoretical work of ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> with the keck interferometer , we have studied at 2  um the innermost regions of several nearby , young , dust depleted `` transitional '' disks . </S>",
    "<S> our observations target five of the six clearest cases of transitional disks in the taurus / auriga star - forming region ( dm tau , gm aur , lkca 15 , ux tau a , and ry tau ) to explore the possibility that the depletion of optically thick dust from the inner disks is caused by stellar companions rather than the more typical planet - formation hypothesis . at the 99.7% confidence level , </S>",
    "<S> the observed visibilities exclude binaries with flux ratios of at least 0.05 and separations ranging from 2.5 to 30 mas ( 0.35 - 4 au ) over @xmath094% of the area covered by our measurements . all targets but dm  tau show near - infrared excess in their sed higher than our companion flux ratio detection limits . </S>",
    "<S> while a companion has previously been detected in the candidate transitional disk system , we can exclude similar mass companions as the typical origin for the clearing of inner dust in transitional disks and of the near - infrared excess emission . </S>",
    "<S> unlike coku  tau/4 , all our targets show some evidence of accretion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all but one of the targets are clearly spatially resolved , and ux  tau  a is marginally resolved . </S>",
    "<S> our data is consistent with hot material on small scales ( 0.1 au ) inside of and separated from the cooler outer disk , consistent with the recent sed modeling . </S>",
    "<S> these observations support the notion that some transitional disks have radial gaps in their optically thick material , which could be an indication for planet formation in the habitable zone ( @xmath1 a few au ) of a protoplanetary disk . </S>"
