    "strong anisotropy of layered superconductors , such as high - t@xmath0 superconductors , results in a number of specific features .",
    "in particular , magnetic field parallel to the conducting layers induces coreless vortices similar to fluxons in conventional josephson tunnel junctions  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the fluxons in conventional josephson junctions , the current and magnetic field of a josephson vortex in layered superconductors are spread over many conducting layers .",
    "the transport current flowing in the stack direction forces the vortices to slide along superconducting layers .",
    "since in contrast to standard abrikosov vortices the josephson vortices are coreless , their motion does not involve perturbations of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter and corresponds at low temperatures to an underdamped regime .",
    "so the velocity of such vortices , in principle , can be quite large .",
    "many dynamical properties of josephson vortices in layered superconducting crystals are similar to those of fluxons in artificially prepared stacked josephson junctions ( see , _",
    "e. g. _ , ref .  ) .",
    "the josephson vortices can be arranged in a lattice , however , possibility of multiple metastable states corresponding to vortex configurations which do not form any lattice is predicted as well at small magnetic field  @xcite . at larger magnetic field",
    "the josephson vortices form a lattice and , hence , in the flux - flow regime the coherent motion of the vortex lattice is expected .",
    "such a regime must induce coherent electromagnetic radiation from the uniformly sliding lattice .",
    "the flux - flow regime of this lattice was observed in bscco mesa structures  @xcite .",
    "however , the regime of coherent sliding of the lattice was found to be limited by a maximum voltage and , hence , by a maximum lattice velocity  @xcite . above this voltage",
    "either a different regime was observed  @xcite or no stable i - v curves were found in a close range of currents and voltages  @xcite .",
    "in addition , above the maximum velocity a broad - band non - josephson emission in the microwave region was observed  @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for the velocity of the coherent flux - flow regime was obtained theoretically in our studies of stability of the vortex lattice  @xcite , and was related to the interaction of the vortices with josephson plasma modes excited by moving vortices . a regular motion of josephson vortices in a form of the rhombic lattice , usually called the triangular lattice ,",
    "was found to be stable at velocities up to a critical value @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the period of the crystal lattice in the stack direction , @xmath3 is the london penetration depth , @xmath4 is the dielectric constant in the stack direction .",
    "this critical velocity was identified with the experimentally observed velocity limiting two regimes of the vortex motion  @xcite .",
    "we have found that at higher velocities sliding of a regular vortex lattice is frustrated due to a growth of fluctuations of the vortex lattice .",
    "the instability is induced by interaction of the vortices with the josephson plasma mode .",
    "the similar results were obtained both in the limit of large magnetic fields , when the distance between the vortices is smaller than the size of the non - linear region near the vortex center , and for the case of lower magnetic fields  @xcite when the vortices are separated by distances much larger than the size of the non - linear region .",
    "however , qualitatively different conclusions on the stability of moving vortex lattice were made in recent papers by koshelev and aranson  @xcite . according to their calculations a stable vortex lattice motion",
    "can occur not only in a form of the triangular lattice , but also in a form of various oblique lattices ( see fig .",
    "[ figlattice ] ) , a particular experimentally realized lattice being uniquely selected by boundary conditions .",
    "regimes of stable motion of various oblique vortex lattices were found also for velocities exceeding the critical value @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of a set of various stable vortex lattices for a given sliding velocity would lead to interesting physical consequences . since a particular vortex lattice",
    "is uniquely selected by boundary conditions , the radiation spectrum must also strongly depend on boundary conditions . specifically , in contrast to other vortex lattices , the triangular one does not emit at the main radiation frequency related to the time needed to shift the lattice by its period .",
    "this happens since the emissions by adjacent vortex rows , which in the triangular lattice are shifted by the half - period , compensate each other .",
    "therefore , in case of the triangular lattice the radiation is generated at even harmonics only .",
    "the oblique lattices , in which the shifts between the adjacent vortex rows are not equal to the half - period , can radiate both at even and odd harmonics as well .",
    "furthermore , the intensity of the radiation maximum predicted at the josephson plasma frequency  @xcite would be much larger if there exists a stable vortex lattice arrangement at @xmath6 .    to eliminate the discrepancy and to resolve the problem we reconsider stability of sliding vortex lattices and find that the oblique vortex lattices are not stable .",
    "instability of oblique lattices is found out from the analysis of equations of motion for perturbations of the lattice beyond the linear approximation in the perturbations ( sec .",
    "we illustrate this statement by a particular case of the equilibrium state , _",
    "i. e. _ , of the lattice at rest ( sec .",
    "iii ) . in the equilibrium state",
    "the results are especially transparent , because the stable vortex arrangement can be selected as that corresponding to a minimal energy .",
    "we conclude that oblique lattices correspond to a saddle point of the energy functional with respect to perturbations of a uniform lattice , and only the triangular lattice corresponds to a minimum .",
    "this is revealed when the terms beyond the quadratic ones are kept in the corresponding energy expansion .",
    "therefore , to study stability of sliding vortex lattices by means of equations of motion one should proceed beyond the linear approximation with respect to perturbations .",
    "electrodynamic properties of layered superconductors can be described in terms of gauge invariant potentials which can be treated as superconducting momentum in layer @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and gauge invariant phase difference between layers @xmath9 and @xmath7 of the superconducting order parameter , @xmath10 . in general case electric and magnetic fields in",

    "( [ eqm1 ] ) at larger velocities for any value of @xmath33 there are values of @xmath61 for which the imaginary part of the frequency of the oscillations becomes positive .",

    "a positive damping factor for a given @xmath33 and for all values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 means the stability of the vortex lattice . while a negative damping factor , in other words , a positive increment of growth , manifests the instability .",
    "analytical and numerical calculations show that the damping factor is not negative for the whole region of values of @xmath33 for a given value of the vortex velocity including zero velocity .",
    "this result was interpreted in refs .   as an evidence of the stability of these lattices .",
    "however , the existence of a set of different stable lattices at zero velocity apparently contradicts to the studies of the equilibrium lattice  @xcite and to the results of the preceding section according to which only the triangular lattice should be stable .",
    "the point is that though for the oblique lattices the damping factor is positive for finite values of @xmath86 , it is equal to zero for @xmath87 .",
    "this indicates that the linear approximation on @xmath88 does not give an ultimate answer on the stability problem , and further study is needed .",
    "the situation can be clarified considering the particular example of the equilibrium state when the stable solution can be selected using the energy considerations .",
    "if the series expansion of the energy with respect to perturbations near the extremum does not contain the quadratic term , then contribution of the potential energy to the linearized equation of motion becomes zero suggesting a zero damping coefficient in a corresponding equation of motion .",
    "therefore in order to study stability in such a case one must take into account the next order perturbations in the energy expansion in perturbations . if the third order term in perturbations in the expansion of the potential energy is non - zero then the extremum of the energy corresponds to a saddle point and , hence , to an instability .",
    "these considerations can not be directly applied to the nonequilibrium case the stability of which should be studied by means of equations of motion , but they point out that to find whether solutions with zero damping factor in the linear approximation are really stable , one must include in the equation of motion for the phase the next order terms in perturbations @xmath57 .",
