    "to determine the trajectory of a photon being observed in the human cornea , from a point within the anterior central corneal epithelium to a point within the posterior stroma .",
    "refractive error places an enormous disease burden on society , with net estimates of over two billion people affected worldwide  @xcite .",
    "myopia , hyperopia , presbyopia , astigmatism , and cataracts are among the most common forms of refractive error .",
    "refractive surgery is an effective and growing method of correcting refractive error .",
    "there are a high volume of cases performed annually , including cataract extractions with intraocular lens placement , laser - assisted in - situ keratomileusis ( lasik ) by microkeratome incision or by femtosecond laser incision , photorefractive keratectomy ( prk ) , and laser - assisted sub - epithelial keratomileusis ( lasek ) .",
    "refractive surgery techniques and technologies have seen significant advances over the years including current reports of greater than 90% patient satisfaction post - operatively  @xcite .",
    "however , outcomes remain suboptimal and patients are often still left to manage imperfect vision following surgery .",
    "most modern refractive surgery techniques involve direct modification of the corneal epithelium and stroma .",
    "it is therefore important to have a precise and detailed understanding of the refractive properties along this path .",
    "it is additionally imperative to understand how those properties govern the behavior of light both as a source of visual stimulus , and in amplified form , as lasers for refractive and other ophthalmic intervention .",
    "furthermore , a precise quantitative mapping of the refractive properties of the human cornea is requisite for good design of keratoprosthetic implants . in this paper , we embark on a mathematical exploration of the photon trajectory from the anterior central corneal epithelium to the posterior stroma .",
    "we operate within the realm of geometric optics , which assumes the limit of short wavelength , where light propagation can be approximated by rays and studied using geometry .",
    "we introduce the trajectron algorithm for computing the photon trajectory in a model respectful of the cornea s axial grin nature .",
    "meridional intra - corneal grin is of significantly less magnitude than axial intra - corneal grin , and is assumed to be zero in this model .",
    "trajectron uses a closed form solution of the ray equation of constant axial grin media , and evaluates over piece - wise constant grin .",
    "one advantage of trajectron is that it is not restricted to the paraxial regime .",
    "this makes it eligible for the study of non - paraxial optical phenomena such as peripheral visual field analysis , as well as higher - order aberrations before and after refractive surgery .",
    "previous mathematical models of the human eye assumed the corneal refractive index to be constant  @xcite .",
    "such models were proposed when less was known about the intra - corneal grin nature .",
    "a few recent models based on ray - transfer matrix ( abcd ) analysis incorporate the intra - corneal grin nature .",
    "barbero proposed a multilayer model of cornea and tear - film to calculate corneal power .",
    "his global ray - transfer matrix was a product of 7 matrices representing ray transfer through 4 interfaces and 3 media which included a grin stroma  @xcite .",
    "flores - arias et al proposed a linear cascade model expressing the generalized fresnel integral transform kernel in terms of paraxial coefficients ; where the global ray - transfer matrix was a product of anterior chamber , grin cornea , and grin lens component ray - transfer matrices  @xcite . these newer models incorporating the grin nature represent a significant advance .",
    "one disadvantage however , is that they are restricted to the paraxial regime , and this limits their validity for peripheral visual field analysis and non - paraxial photon tracking .",
    "in contrast , our current work is useful for investigating interesting non - paraxial optical phenomenology , because it respects the intra - corneal grin nature , and is not restricted to the paraxial regime .      in this paper",
    "we make the following technical and biophysical contributions :    * the first quantitative demonstration of non - paraxial light - bending within the human cornea . * an analytico - numerical algorithm , trajectron , for determining the photon trajectory within the human cornea , respecting axial grin and assuming zero meridional grin . * a method for studying non - paraxial optical phenomena in the human cornea .",
    "for example : * * peripheral visual field analysis * * higher order aberrations pre and post refractive surgery * an approach towards describing the angular domain over which the paraxial approximation is clinically useful in the human cornea .",
    "we use a hybrid approach inter - weaving between analytical and numerical processes .",
    "our objective is to determine the ray path from a point in the anterior central corneal epithelium to a point in the posterior stroma .",
    "the human cornea has an axial grin of non - constant magnitude  @xcite , and we approximate it as also having zero meridional grin .",
    "this approximation is made because , although meridional intra - corneal grin has been demonstrated in - vivo in humans  @xcite , it is significantly less than the axial intra - corneal grin  @xcite .",
    "to achieve our objective , we introduce trajectron , a new algorithm which evaluates a closed form solution of the ray equation of constant axial grin media , over piece - wise constant axial grin .",
    "the details of the trajectron algorithm are presented in section  ( [ sec : rslt ] ) below .",
    "discrete measurements of corneal refractive indices are obtained from the literature , and a continuous distribution is generated by curve fitting .",
    "trajectron is prototyped in matlab ( the mathworks inc . , natick , ma ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section  ( [ sec : physfor ] ) outlines the physical formalism of lagrangian optics and includes a known closed form solution of the ray equation of constant axial grin media ; section  ( [ sec : msmt ] ) describes structure , thickness , and refractive index measurements within the human cornea ; section  ( [ sec : compu ] ) introduces the trajectron algorithm ; section  ( [ sec : rslt ] ) presents the results of our numerical experiments ; section  ( [ sec : disc ] ) discusses the findings , the study limitations , and the clinical angular domain of the paraxial and non - paraxial regimes ; and section  ( [ sec : conclu ] ) concludes the paper .",

    "the corneal epithelium is a non - keratinized stratified squamous epithelium  @xcite of 5 - 7 cell layers with rapid surface turn over .",
    "the corneal epithelium is covered by mucinous tear film anteriorly , and is adjacent to bowman s layer posteriorly .",
    "the morphology of the air - tear film interface approximately conforms to the corneal epithelial surface .",
    "corneal epithelial surface layer abrasions can cause significant visual distortion , and can manifest photophobia and moderate to severe amounts of pain .",

    "it is therefore reasonable to conjecture that the refractive indicex function of the anterior stroma is intermediate between those of bowman s layer and posterior stroma .",
    "this is premised on the notion that the group refractive index of a substance is a function of the refractive indices of the biochemical constituents of that substance .",
    "hence the group refractive index can be estimated by a weighted summation rule such as the gladstone - dale relation ; or it can be estimated by interpolation , as we do here .",

    "horizontal branching occurs among both anterior and posterior lamellae , however only anterior lamellae exhibit axial branching  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the posterior stroma has been found to be more susceptible to hydration and swelling than the anterior stroma  @xcite . though the posterior stroma is largely spared in current refractive surgery procedures",

    "but like their older counterparts , these newer models are based on paraxial approximation and ray transfer matrix analysis  @xcite .",
    "the first - order paraxial approximation of the wave equation in shortwavelength limit , is one whose solutions are rays propagating along straight lines . and this linearity allows an optical system to be modelled using ray - transfer matrix analysis .",
    "the fitness of these ray - transfer matrix analyses depend on the magnitude of high frequency coefficients in the fourier transform of the refractive index function . in the case of highly varying refractive index gradient and",
    "consequently highly varying ray spatial gradient , linear approximations have limited validity . and a prohibitively large number of optical elements or ray transfer matrices may be required to obtain a good approximation of the ray path .",
    "the transition zone between the corneal epithelium and bowman s layer is an example of such a steep gradient , where finer linearization granularity is required .",

    "we see an increase in non - linearity with @xmath92 .",
    "this increase in non - linearity is correlated with a loss of paraxial approximation validity . also from figure  ( [ fig : l_broom_1black ] ) , we see that linear - like form is preserved over a much wider angle than only those for which sin@xmath102 .",
    "this suggests that the angular domain over which the paraxial approximation is clinically applicable is more broad than suggested by the small angle approximation alone .",
    "for instance , for a @xmath92 of 50 degrees , the @xmath103 is @xmath104 m , which is a relatively small displacement .",
    "in addition to exhibiting such preservation of linear - like form over broad angle , the paraxial approximation is a potent simplification device in theory and practice . for these reasons ,",
    "it has enjoyed much success and longevity in the clinic . however , its domain of validity is limited .",
    "for instance , for @xmath105 75 degrees , the corresponding @xmath103 exceeds @xmath106 mm and increases rapidly and non - linearly with @xmath107 ; such that by @xmath108 degrees , the @xmath103 has reached 5 mm , which is almost the entire radius of the cornea .",
    "this is clearly non - paraxial territory over which the paraxial approximation is invalid .",
    "clinically , this zone is at the fringes of peripheral vision .",
    "loss of vision here is not likely to interfere significantly with daily life , and may even go unnoticed .",
    "however , such subtle peripheral vision loss is often the first sign of an insidious optic neuropathy such as primary open angle glaucoma .    in the numerical experiments presented here , the scope of the photon trajectories studied are exclusively intra - corneal , with @xmath109~\\mu$]m .",
    "based on these purely intra - corneal photon trajectories , we have made inference involving the visual field .",
    "this is justified by a reasonable assumption of continuity .",
    "we have assumed that there exists a correspondence between the intra - corneal angle , @xmath110 , and the @xmath110 of the originating ray source in the visual field . in other words ,",
    "relatively wide angles in the field give rise to relatively wide angles within the cornea , and relatively narrow angles in the field give rise to relatively narrow angles within the cornea .",
    "however , while we have relied on this angular correspondence to make inference on field source , it is important to note that what we have shown in this paper is that this correspondence is non - linear . and",
    "more specifically , we have shown that wide intra - corneal angles give rise to wider intra - corneal angles , while narrow intra - corneal angles remain relatively constant .",
    "limitations of the current study include the assumption of gradient zero in the meridional directions .",
    "vasudevan et al showed naso - temporal gradients in the human corneal epithelium  @xcite . using a portable abb refractometer mounted on a slit - lamp to make measurements on 10 human subjects",
    ", they found corneal vertex , nasal , and temporal refractive indices of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "these gradients are significantly less than those found by patel  @xcite in the axial direction , and hence were assumed to be zero .",
    "the naso - temporal gradients were in the direction of the corneal vertex , and their incorporation into the model can be expected to attenuate the concavity of the photon trajectory to some degree .",
    "however , the overall non - linearity and angular - dependence behavior shown here will be unchanged .",
    "a second limitation of the current work is the non - uniform specimen preparation and measurement method of the axial refractive index .",
    "the epithelial refractive index was measured in - vivo using a modified hand - held refractometer , while the stroma was prepared as bare fresh cornea and measured in - vitro using a bench - top abb refractometer  @xcite .",
    "a third limitation of the current study is the sparsity of refractive index data points currently available to us in the literature .",
    "this sparsity is due to the technological difficulty of making fine high precision refractive index measurements in the human cornea .",
    "most of this challenging work has been done by patel and by vasudevan .",
    "both patel s axial measurements and vasudevan s naso - temporal measurements contained only three data points each , which points towards the challenging nature of the work .",
    "unfortunately , mathematical models based on such sparse data may be susceptible to the aliasing problem .",
    "for instance , in the current study we only had one data point available for the refractive index gradient in the corneal epithelium . however , the corneal epithelium is @xmath50 m thick on average with 5 - 7 cell layers and contains histophysiological gradients .",
    "the cells are older , flatter , and closer to apoptosis anteriorly than posteriorly the epithelium is bathed in the tear film mucinous phase anteriorly and continuous with bowman s layer posteriorly .",
    "these histophysiological gradients suggest that the corneal epithelium contains non - zero refractive index gradients . if a gradient does exists , its direction and form beg investigation .",
    "more generally , finer sampling granularity of the refractive index is needed in the human cornea in each of the three principal axis directions . in - spite of the above limitations ,",
    "the current study has provided a clear first demonstration of non - paraxial intra - corneal light - bending , and highlighted potential areas for further experimental and theoretical collaboration in addressing the global disease burden of refractive error .",
    "in this paper , we have provided the first quantitative demonstration of non - paraxial light - bending within the human cornea .",
    "we have also introduced the trajectron algorithm for computing photon trajectories in the human cornea .",
