    "@xcite argue that the number of dlas per redshift interval and the @xmath6 distribution imply that dlas at @xmath7 are a mix of spirals and lsbs whereas , at higher @xmath3 , they are more likely to be dwarfs .",

    "evidence for an increase in dla metallicities , [ m / h ] , with cosmic time has emerged only gradually @xcite , the latter reference using over 100 dlas to provide the strongest statistical evidence so far .",

    "the new results ( i)(iii ) support our hypothesis that h@xmath1-bearing dlas form a chemically distinct sub - class and may trace chemical evolution more reliably .",
    "the @xmath9@xmath11 correlation was studied by l03 and is discussed further below .",
    "the [ m / h]s and @xmath9s in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are measured using the total @xmath6 across the dla profile and are not specific to the h@xmath1-bearing components .",
    "[ m / fe ] is generally found to be uniform across most dla profiles @xcite , indicating that [ m / h ] should be uniform .",
    "however , the h@xmath1-bearing components typically have much higher [ m / fe ] values than other components in the same dla ( e.g.  l03 and 0347@xmath12383 s [ si / fe ] profile in @xcite ) .",
    "these components usually dominate the non - refractory metal - line profiles and so , although [ m / h ] and @xmath9 will be systematically underestimated , the effect will not be large .",
    "the fitted slopes in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] are likely to be reasonably robust against this effect , but a larger sample and more detailed study is clearly required .    what observational selection effects and biases could contribute to the steep @xmath9@xmath11 evolution ?",
    "firstly , the sample is inhomogeneous since the spectra do not all have similar s / n and since the h@xmath1 detection methods and criteria were not uniform .",
    "indeed , the weak h@xmath1 lines detected towards 0000@xmath122620 are at the typical non - detection level ( see fig .  16 in l03 ) .",
    "the @xmath9@xmath11 correlation is therefore only tentative .",
    "secondly , the h@xmath1 detection limit will alter with @xmath3 : equivalent widths increase but lyman-@xmath0 forest blending worsens with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "though this is an unlikely culprit for the @xmath35 evolution observed , precise quantification of these competing effects requires numerical simulations .",
    "dlas containing large amounts of dust could suppress detection of their background quasars and may therefore be ` missing ' from our sample @xcite .",
    "however , since [ m / h ] , [ m / fe ] and @xmath9 are positively correlated with each other ( e.g.  l03 ) , this effect is likely to suppress , rather than create , the correlations in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a recent survey for dlas towards radio - selected quasars @xcite also indicates that the number of such ` missing ' quasars is likely to be small .",
    "selecting those dlas which exhibit h@xmath1 absorption may focus on systems with a narrower range of physical conditions than the dla population as a whole .",
    "tentative support for this conjecture lies in the steeper , tighter [ m / h]@xmath11 anti - correlation observed for the h@xmath1 systems studied here .",
    "@xcite recently presented detailed chemical evolution models which give a slope for the [ m / h]@xmath11 relation of @xmath36 .",
    "they correct this result for various observational biases to match the shallower slope observed for the general dla population .",
    "however , the steep [ m / h]@xmath11 slope observed for h@xmath1-bearing systems could be less affected by these biases and may avoid those introduced by sampling many different ism gas phases .",
    "it might therefore be more comparable to the uncorrected slopes in the models .",
    "h@xmath1-selected dlas are therefore a candidate for a less biased probe of chemical evolution .",
    "that there exists such a large range ( @xmath37 ) in the values of @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] may not be surprising : @xcite describes a @xmath38}=-1 $ ] photo - ionization model for clouds in local hydrostatic equilibrium . for a representative incident uv background flux and dust - to - metals ratio , the molecular fraction in this model shows a sudden increase of @xmath39 for only a small increase in the total hydrogen density .",
    "therefore , the very steep @xmath9@xmath11 correlation could be achieved with a modest increase in dust content at lower redshifts , consistent with the observed [ m / fe]@xmath11 anti - correlation .",
    "l03 also discuss how @xmath9 might be very sensitive to local physical conditions .",
    "for example , within the schaye model , one expects an anti - correlation between @xmath9 and the intensity of the uv background .",
    "however , the behaviour of the uv background flux with redshift over the range @xmath403 is still a matter of considerable uncertainty .",
    "the strong decrease in @xmath9 at high redshift may also be consistent with recent hi 21-cm absorption measurements in dlas @xcite , where a generally higher spin / excitation temperature is found at @xmath41 .",
