    "stellar metallicity and kinematics are two important means to understand the formation and evolution of our galaxy .",
    "metallicity of a star can be determined spectroscopically or photometrically .",
    "one needs more accurate analyses for the first procedure which can be carried out only for nearby stars , while the second one , the photometric procedure , can be applied to stars at large distances as well .",
    "the second procedure has a long history .",
    "we are indebted to @xcite who discovered the correlation between the weakness of the spectral lines and the ultra - violet ( uv ) excess , @xmath7 , of the stars .",
    "it has been a custom to use the @xmath8 two - colour diagram of the hyades cluster to estimate the @xmath7 colour excesses , i.e. @xmath7 of a star is the difference between the uv colours of the given star and the hyades star with the same @xmath9 colour .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite interpreted the uv excess with the `` blanketing model '' , i.e. the uv excesses of the stars , with the same metal abundance but different @xmath9 colours are different .",
    "this is important for the red stars where the blanketing line is parallel to the intrinsic hyades line and hence @xmath7 is guiotined .",
    "@xcite used a procedure to normalize the uv excesses , as explained in the following .",
    "he separated 112 high proper motion stars into 16 sub - samples with mean colours @xmath9=0.35 , 0.40 , 0.45 , ... , 1.10 , and compared the uv excess for each colour , @xmath7 , with the one for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which is the maximum uv excess for a given star .",
    "then , he adopted the ratio @xmath12 as a normalized factor for the uv excess for the corresponding @xmath9 colour .",
    "@xcite normalized the uv excesses of 101 dwarfs using the procedure of @xcite and calibrated them to the iron abundance @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "@xcite improved this calibration using a different procedure and 88 dwarf stars .",
    "these calibrations provide iron abundances in the @xmath14 photometry .",
    "other studies offered calibration in different photometries , including @xmath14 , ( i.e. * ? ? ?",

    "two recent metallicity calibrations which provide iron abundances with @xmath14 photometry are those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distance of a star is an important parameter in investigation of the kinematic structure of our galaxy which can be determined via trigonometric or photometric parallaxes .",
    "trigonometric parallax procedure can be applied only to nearby stars .",
    "_ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite is the main source for this parallax . for stars at large distances ,",
    "only photometric parallax is available , which is the combination of the apparent and absolute magnitude of a star in question .",
    "absolute magnitude estimation is another problem for the researchers .",
    "the widely used procedure for absolute magnitude estimation is based on the offset from a standard main - sequence , where hyades is generally used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "the colour - absolute magnitude of a specific cluster can also be used for absolute magnitude estimation of stars in a given population , such as thin and thick discs , and halo .",
    "the cluster is chosen such that its metallicity is compatible with the mean metallicity of the population in question .",
    "details for this procedure can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in this study , we present two calibrations ; one for the iron abundance @xmath13 $ ] , and another one for the absolute magnitude offset @xmath15 , in terms of reduced uv excess , @xmath11 .",
    "we used the reduced _ hipparcos _ astrometric data @xcite for the first time and improved both the metallicity and absolute magnitude calibrations .",
    "we organized the paper as follows .",
    "the data are presented in section 2 .",
    "the procedure is given in section 3 , and section 4 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the data used in our study is a combination of the star samples given in four spectroscopic studies , i.e. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we separated the f - g dwarf stars in these studies with the temperature and surface gravity constraints of @xcite , i.e. @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( cgs ) and reduced the multiple observations to a single one .",
    "the number of stars taken from the mentioned studies in the order given above which supply the constraints of @xcite are 263 , 83 , 51 , and 32 , respectively . after excluding the binary and variable stars from the sample , as well as the multiple observations , the total star sample reduced to 168 .",
    "the iron abundances of these stars were also taken from the mentioned four spectroscopic studies .",
    "we used the reduced _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite and estimated the distances of the sample stars using the following equation :    @xmath18    the @xmath19 apparent magnitudes and , @xmath20 and @xmath9 colours of the sample stars are provided from the catalogue of @xcite and they are de - reddened by the procedure explained in the following .",
    "we adopted the total absorption for the model , @xmath21 , @xcite and estimated the total absorption for the distance of the star , @xmath22 , by the following equation of @xcite :    @xmath23,\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the galactic latitude and distance of the star , respectively , and @xmath26 is the scale - height of the dust ( @xmath27 pc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "we fitted the guillotine factors of @xcite in sixteen @xmath9 colours to a sixth degree polynomial as in the following which could be used to evaluate a guillotine factor ( normalized factor ) for each @xmath9 colour :    @xmath46     prediction levels . ]",
