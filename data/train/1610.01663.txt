    "we consider a line lightning protection device ( llpd ) consisting of a series of arc gaps between a power line and the ground . during normal grid operation ,",
    "the device works as an insulator since the voltage over the device is insufficient to cause dielectric breakdown and arcing . in the case of a lightning strike ,",
    "on the other hand , the large overvoltage will ignite a series of electric arcs in the device .",
    "this allows the ligthning current to be redirected to the ground , thereby protecting the insulation of the power line .",
    "a typical llpd is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : streamer_device ] .        an important characteristic of the llpd is its ability to quench the current following a lightning strike .",
    "experiments performed on real devices have consistently demonstrated two modes of current quenching@xcite : in the case of _ current zero quenching _ ( zq ) , current will flow through the device until it passes through zero due to the vanishing grid voltage .",
    "this results in arcing times of the order to 10  ms . in the case of _",
    "impulse quenching _ ( iq ) , the current is suppressed within less than 0.1  ms after the lightning strike , leading to significantly less erosion of the arcing chambers and the electrodes .",
    "the two modes of quenching are similar to the behavior of circuit breakers@xcite .",
    "the arc voltage in high - voltage breakers is much smaller than the grid voltage and the current will continue to flow unimpeded through the arc until the next current zero , corresponding to zq . in the case of low voltage breakers ,",
    "typically equipped with splitter plates , the total arc voltage is higher than the grid voltage and the arc current is limited , corresponding to iq .",
    "there is one very important difference between lightning protection devices and circuit breakers , however . in the case of a circuit breaker",
    ", the grid current has to be interrupted .",
    "the llpd , on the other hand , only has to transmit the current from the lightning pulse .",
    "any follow current due to the grid voltage is detrimental to the device and should be quenchend as quickly as possible .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a physical explanation of the two modes of current quenching and to develop a simulation model suitable for virtual product development .",
    "we begin by looking at a simple circuit with the arc gap represented by the cassie - mayr arc model .",
    "a dimensional analysis of this model leads to a simple criterion for iq in terms of the grid voltage , the maximum follow current , and the power loss of the arc . in a second step ,",
    "we develop a complete 3d arc simulation based on the assumption of a thermal plasma and use it to simulate both zq and iq .",
    "this model allows us to examine the shape of the arc in the real arcing chamber geometry and to study the interaction of the arc with the circuit .",
    "the difference between impulse quenching and current zero quenching can be illustrated easily in the laboratory using the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit - arc ] . the left part of the circuit represents the oscillating grid voltage and the right part represents the arcing device @xmath3 in series with the footing resistance @xmath4 of the tower and the ground .",

    "an often used approximation for the loss - function is to assume that the current density of the arc is constant , i.e.  the radius is proportional to @xmath16 , and that the arc only loses energy from its surface@xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "another way of understanding the importance of the exponent @xmath19 is to consider the stationary arc voltage from ( [ cmeq1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath20 we obtain @xmath21 the important point is that that the arc shows _ negative differential resistance _ , meaning that the arc voltage decreases with increasing current for any @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the arc voltage is approximately independent of the current .",
    "the derivation below is valid for any @xmath22 and we shall use @xmath24 for illustration .    before solving the circuit equations , it makes sense to write them in dimensionless form using the circuit parameters .",
    "the charging voltage of the capacitor @xmath1 determines the voltage level and the time scale @xmath25 is defined through @xmath26 the corresponding scale for the current follows from @xmath27 the unit for resistance will then be @xmath28 and the unit for power @xmath29 we write all physical quantities as a product of the physical scale and a dimensionless quantity according to @xmath30    with these definitions , the equations for the circuit are given by @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 [ eqdl3 ] where @xmath34 is a dimensionless constant determining power loss of the arc , i.e. , the loss - function is written as @xmath35 this new set of equations ( [ eqdl1])-([eqdl4 ] ) only contains dimensionless constants @xmath36 , @xmath34 and @xmath37 .",
    "typical examples of zero quenching ( zq ) and impulse quenching ( iq ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : iq - zq ] .",
    "the arc is ignited by switching the value of @xmath38 from a very large constant value ( in our case @xmath39 ) to @xmath40 at time @xmath41 , where the capacitor is fully charged . in the case of zq",
    ", the arc will continue to burn until the grid voltage across the arc gap vanishes and the arc is extinguished . in the case of iq ,",
    "the grid voltage is insufficient to maintain the arc and it vanishes at a time scale of the order to @xmath14 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have analyzed the two modes of current quenching appearing in llpds and provided a theoretical explanation for the phenomena .",
    "a dimensional analysis shows that if the cooling power of the arc is proportinal to the product of the grid voltage an the maximum follow current ( @xmath0 ) , we can guarantee impulse quenching with a very short follow current , leading to considerably less erosion of the the device .",
    "this has important consequences for applications .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that quenching power of the arc can be simulated very well using fully resolved 3d simulations based on the magnetohydrodynamic equations for a thermal plasma .",
    "as expected , radiation is the main mechanism by which the arc loses energy .",
    "this means that the current - voltage characteristics of the arc are sensitive to the absorption spectrum of the plasma .",
    "more effort will have to go into the definition and computation of effective absorption coefficients for the plasma and this will be subject of an upcoming publication .",
    "in addition , more detailed modeling will also have to include the effects of contact erosion and ablation of wall material , changing both the pressure in the arcing chamber and the composition of the plasma .",
    "the 3d simulations of the arcing phenomenon will make it possible to design future llpds on the computer .",
