    "kinetic exchange models provide a minimal description of wealth exchange between economic units ( representing , e.g. , individuals , families , or companies ) in a way formally similar to that in which energy is transferred between molecules of a fluid due to collisions  @xcite .",
    "such models were introduced independently in different fields such as social sciences  @xcite , economics  @xcite , and physics  @xcite .",
    "john angle  @xcite originally introduced this type of models basing them on the surplus theory , with the goal of describing the origin of wealth inequalities . compared with other agent - based models of financial markets  @xcite ,",
    "the structure of kinetic exchange models is extremely simple : they only describe wealth flows between economic units without considering ( explicitly ) other elements of a market dynamics .",
    "however , even so they predict quite realistic shapes of wealth distributions  @xcite .    in kinetic exchange models it is assumed that the total wealth of the system is conserved , following in turn from wealth conservation during each unit - unit interaction .",
    "the dynamics can be formulated through the following update rule at a generic time iteration @xmath0 defining the wealth exchange between two units @xmath1 and @xmath2 chosen randomly among the @xmath3 units of the system ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are the wealths of the trading units @xmath1 and @xmath2 before ( after ) the exchange and @xmath10 is the exchanged amount of wealth . without loss of generality , in eqs .",
    "( [ general - rule ] ) the plus ( minus ) sign has been chosen for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) ; who wins or loses depends on the sign of @xmath11 .",
    "the conservation of the total wealth of the system leads to an equilibrium wealth distribution that coincides formally with the gibbs energy distribution .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , most of kinetic exchange models can be formulated in a unified way , where the amount of exchanged wealth in eqs .",
    "( [ general - rule ] ) is expressed as @xmath12 here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two suitable stochastic variables in @xmath15 to be extracted at each trade , representing the fractions of wealth of unit @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively , involved in the trade .",
    "various aspects of kinetic exchange models have been criticized . a first objection concerns wealth conservation .",
    "namely , it is pointed out that the assumption of a perfect conservation of wealth is incompatible with the fact that in real systems wealth is not conserved , a most relevant reason being the existence of production - consumption processes . in fact",
    ", kinetic exchange models can be interpreted as models with homogeneous production and consumption . to show this , one can use a modified form of a kinetic exchange model where production and consumption have been explicitly added to the dynamics . it is convenient to start from eqs .",
    "( [ general - rule ] ) and ( [ w_exch ] ) and write the total wealth variation of a generic unit @xmath1 during a time step @xmath16 , defined as the time interval corresponding to one monte carlo swap over all the units @xmath2 ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 + ( p - c ) x_j   \\ , .\\ ] ] here the homogeneous production and consumption terms have been added , with production and consumption rates @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ; @xmath21 ( and analogously for @xmath22 ) . in the continuous time limit , @xmath23",
    ", one can introduce the auxiliary variables @xmath24 \\ , , \\ ] ] where a possible time dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 has been taken into account .",
    "equations  ( [ general - rule1 ] ) written in the new variables @xmath25 do not contain anymore the production and consumptions terms and turn into the equations of the corresponding model _ without _ production and consumption , in which wealth conservation holds . however , this is not valid in the case of strong heterogeneity , in which the consumption and production processes of each unit have to be taken into account separately .",
    "another critic toward kinetic exchange models claims that the type of trade dynamics they model can hardly resemble an actual economic trade .",
    "in fact , traditional approaches of economics assume that the decisions to carry out a trade are taken by rational agents or by economic agents with bounded rationality on the base of the total or partial information available about the system . instead , kinetic exchange models may resemble at first sight more a hazard game , due to their random dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that due to their statistical nature kinetic exchange models certainly do not provide a direct picture of the economic trading or the exchange activity that they are supposed to describe .",
    "so far a satisfactory microscopic picture and justifications of the models are missing .",
    "their justification is pragmatic in nature , in that it relies a posteriori on the successful prediction of realistic shapes of wealth distributions .",
    "a notable exception is the investigation reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a direct link with micro - economics is suggested .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to make a step toward a microscopic foundation of kinetic wealth exchange models .",
    "this is carried out along a twofold path .",
    "as a first element of the proposed reformulation , a novel `` immediate - exchange '' dynamics is introduced in sect .",
    "[ immediate ] in order to represent an actual exchange of goods rather than a random reshuffling or a uni - directional flow of the wealths of the interacting units , characteristic of other kinetic exchange models .",
    "this novel dynamics is shown to produce equilibrium wealth distributions that better describes empirical data also in the very small wealth range . secondly , in sect .",
    "[ trading ] we introduce a probabilistic criterion that is used by each economic unit in order to decide whether to carry out an exchange or not .",
    "the exchange is carried out only if both units accept to do it .",
    "such an acceptance criterion describes the decision process of a single unit during each interaction and can be suitably customized to represent the type and amount of partial information available to a unit during the trade . in the present work",
    "we follow a microscopic approach considering acceptance criteria only based on the information concerning the ongoing trade , that is directly available to the two interacting economic units . to the best of our knowledge a probabilistic approach based on the ( partial ) information available about the quality and price of a product has been introduced in micro - economic models in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the probabilistic criteria used in many - agents models usually follow an approach based on a utility function  @xcite .    as an important check versus real data , the heterogeneous version of the new model is studied in sect .",
    "[ heterogeneous ] .",
    "it is shown that , analogously to e.g. the chakrabarti - chakraborti kinetic exchange model , there exist suitable sets of diversified parameters reproducing realistic wealth distributions on all scales including the large wealth range where the pareto power - law is observed .    results and possible future lines of research",
    "are discussed in the conclusion .",
    "in this section a kinetic exchange model that provides a description of a market where encounters between units are accompanied by immediate exchanges , is proposed . by `` immediate exchange ''",
    "it is meant for example the type of interchanges that characterize barter where goods are directly exchanged without using a medium of exchange , or market economies where goods are exchanged with money immediately or according to some agreed time schedule .",
    "immediate exchanges are to be contrasted with the `` delayed exchanges '' characterizing e.g. gift economies  @xcite , where for cultural reasons valuables are given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards . in the latter case",
    "one can talk about unidirectional trades .",
    "unidirectional trades can also be used to describe , e.g. , insurance business .    for the sake of clarity , we start by considering a barter model , in which one can think of each unit @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) as having some items that he is willing to change for something else at some point ; the total value of these items is @xmath28 . the model is evolved in time by extracting randomly two units @xmath1 and @xmath2 at every time iteration . the two units interchange something with value @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are two independent uniform random numbers in the interval @xmath33 $ ] , different at each iteration .",
    "the random nature of these quantities describes the situation in which each time when somebody is trying to do a trade it can be of a different object among all the things he owns and is willing to exchange for something else .",
    "notice that the model does not distinguish between different types of goods but focuses only on the corresponding amounts of wealth exchanged between units ; therefore , one of the goods can be possibly understood as the currency in use .",
    "thus , the model can be reinterpreted as the one of a currency - based market . in the case of a currency - based trade , where an object of value @xmath6 is exchanged with some money @xmath7 ,",
    "the random numbers describe intrinsic fluctuations of prices and currency values .",
    "the dynamics of the proposed model can be defined by the following equations : @xmath34 which can be rewritten in the same form of eqs .",
    "( [ general - rule ] ) with @xmath35 because @xmath36 then from eqs .",
    "( [ general - rule ] ) together with ( [ delta ] ) it is clear that a situation where @xmath37 ( i.e. , a unit @xmath26 owns all the wealth of the system ) or @xmath38 ( i.e. , a unit @xmath26 is totally poor ) is not possible at any moment of time .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations show that the equilibrium distribution of wealth is a @xmath39-distribution , @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in the following , using the fact that @xmath42 and the average wealth is constant and always set here as @xmath43 due to the initial conditions @xmath44 , one has @xmath45 and it is convenient to use the simplified one - parameter form @xmath46_{\\langle x \\rangle = 1}$ ] , i.e. , @xmath47 the equilibrium wealth distribution corresponding to the value of the shape parameter @xmath48 found from the fitting for the immediate - exchange model is @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the wealth distribution is zero at zero wealth , @xmath50 , and decays exponentially at large @xmath51 .",
    "it is to be noticed that the value of @xmath52 is in the range @xmath53 of the values characterizing real distributions , such as the household incomes analyzed by salem and mount  @xcite .",
    "this value has been obtained using the plain immediate - exchange dynamics without further hypotheses , as for instance the introduction of an explicit saving propensity constraining the amount of wealth entering an exchange , as in the chakraborti - chakrabarti model .    as a technical remark , the considerations above are valid for random numbers @xmath54 uniformly distributed in @xmath15 .",
    "employing random numbers with different distributions will produce accordingly a modified shape of the equilibrium wealth distribution .",
    "details about the numerical algorithms used in the simulations of kinetic exchange models can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also notice that the dynamics described by eqs .",
    "( [ xj ] ) is in the very spirit of kinetic exchange models , reflecting even more closely than other kinetic exchange models the statistical similarity of wealth flows to inter - molecular energy exchanges .",
    "in fact , according to kinetic theory , the energy exchanged in a collision between two molecules @xmath1 and @xmath2 has the form given by eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "the variables @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend then on the initial directions of the molecular velocities and are to be considered _ independent random numbers _ in the hypothesis of molecular chaos .",
    "for further details see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the immediate - exchange model introduced above is formally very similar to a model introduced by dr@xmath57gulescu and yakovenko @xcite , described by eqs .",
    "( [ general - rule ] ) with @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a random number in @xmath33 $ ] . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ delta ] ) and ( [ delta - dy ] ) , one can see that while in the dynamics of the model of dr@xmath57gulescu and yakovenko only one random number @xmath59 is present , the model introduced above contains two random numbers and reduces to the first one by setting @xmath60 . however , in the context of wealth exchanges such a strong correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath56 is difficult to understand .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of the dr@xmath57gulescu and yakovenko model can be better understood by rewriting the update relations as @xmath61 representing a random reshuffling in a single time of the total initial amount @xmath62 between the two interacting units .",
    "the presence of two independent random numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 _ versus _ the single random number @xmath59 may seem a technical detail , but it implies basically different interpretations .",
    "importantly , the model of dr@xmath57gulescu and yakovenko leads to the exponential equilibrium wealth distribution describing a society where most of the people are really poor and the distribution mode is @xmath63 .",
    "instead , the model proposed leads to the @xmath39-distribution @xmath64 with shape parameter @xmath48 , which corresponds to a society where most of the people have the wealth around the average value @xmath43 ( assuming that initially each unit has a wealth @xmath65 ) , with a mode @xmath66 and there is nobody with @xmath67 .",
    "the model of dr@xmath57gulescu and yakovenko was modified by chakraborti and chakrabarti @xcite assuming that it is not the total initial amount @xmath62 that is reshuffled randomly between the two interacting units but only a part @xmath68 , while a fraction @xmath69 is put aside .",
    "the corresponding exchange rule reads : @xmath70 the latter equations are equivalent to eqs .",
    "( [ general - rule ] ) with @xmath71   \\ , .\\ ] ] in this model the equilibrium distribution of wealth is well described by a @xmath39-distribution with an @xmath72 , given by @xcite @xmath73 if @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 and a mode @xmath75 , if @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the exponential shape of the equilibrium wealth distribution of the dr@xmath57gulescu and yakovenko model arises from the possibility that during a given interaction a unit can in principle lose _ all _ wealth that will go to some other unit .",
    "considering eqs .",
    "( [ dy ] ) , this will happen to unit @xmath1 whenever the extracted value of the random number @xmath59 is close enough to zero .",
    "the model of chakraborti and chakrabarti  @xcite is in this respect illuminating , since it shows that due to the introduction of saving ( through a saving propensity @xmath76 ) such a situation never occurs and there are no units for @xmath77 , leading not to the exponential but to a @xmath39-distribution ( [ gamma ] ) with shape parameter ( [ alpha0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , units carrying out immediate exchanges can be formally seen as equivalent to units with a saving propensity .",
    "more precisely the immediate exchange model proposed leads to the same equilibrium wealth distribution as the model of chakraborti and chakrabarti with @xmath78 .",
    "the fundamental difference is that in the model proposed here , the situation with @xmath38 is excluded naturally without further assumptions solely by the fact that even if during an exchange a unit @xmath1 gives away everything , he always receives something in exchange from the other unit @xmath2 and thus , after the transaction , one always finds an @xmath79 for each @xmath26 .    while the model of dr@xmath57gulescu and yakovenko assumes that the total amount of wealth , @xmath62 , is reshuffled randomly between the two interacting units , the first model introduced by angle @xcite assumes a unidirectional flow : with probability @xmath80 a random fraction @xmath59 of the wealth @xmath6 of unit @xmath1 is transferred to unit @xmath2 , while with probability @xmath81 a random fraction @xmath59 of the wealth @xmath7 of unit @xmath2 is transferred to unit @xmath1 . considering the particular case of the symmetrical interaction , i.e. , @xmath82 , then the dynamical evolution of the model is determined by eqs .",

    "the results can also be expressed by saying that the relative acceptance criterion with acceptance parameter @xmath84 , defined by eqs .",

    "[ fig_r1_a - vs - l]-bottom .",
    "it is clear that for every value of the acceptance parameter @xmath84 one has @xmath154 , i.e. , the use of an acceptance criterion is equivalent to a larger saving propensity . for large values of @xmath84 ,",
    "when the acceptance criterion becomes very loose , results reduce to the original chakraborti - chakrabarti model without acceptance criterion and @xmath155 .    a surprising point implied by these results",
    "is that the saving propensity of the chakraborti - chakrabarti model can be generated by introducing a relative acceptance criterion .",
    "in fact , the considerations above also apply to the dr@xmath57gulescu - yakovenko model , that is obtained from the chakraborti - chakrabarti model in the limit @xmath156 .",
    "thus , one can start from the dr@xmath57gulescu - yakovenko model without saving propensity and obtain the same equilibrium distribution of the chakraborti - chakrabarti model with arbitrary saving propensity @xmath69 , corresponding to the dots at @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ fig_r1_a - vs - l ] , through the use of an acceptance criterion with a suitable value of @xmath84 .",
    "this justifies at the microscopic level of the decision processes , carried out by the units before an exchange , the use of a saving propensity @xmath76 inserted `` by hand '' in the chakraborti - chakrabarti model as a convenient numerical or effective statistical procedure .",
    "in this section we investigate the generalization of the homogeneous model studied above to the heterogeneous case , when each unit behaves according to a different trading criterion . as in the homogeneous case",
    ", the presence of a heterogeneity in the parameter values can be related to specific features of the units , such as the efficiency of the trading strategy employed by the units or their education level  @xcite .    here , we limit ourselves to consider an absolute acceptance criterion .",
    "in fact , while the equilibrium distribution of a homogeneous system is invariant under change of the form of the ( symmetrical ) criterion employed , the presence of a heterogeneity level in the system parameters is sufficient to break this invariance .",
    "the same piece - wise linear probability function considered above is used , but now each unit @xmath1 ( @xmath157 is characterized by a different parameter @xmath158 . the corresponding acceptance probability function is given by @xmath159 the equilibrium distribution does not have a universal shape anymore and depends on the specific acceptance parameters @xmath160 used or on their distribution @xmath161 that can be defined in the limit of a large number of units .",
    "it to be noticed that heterogeneity does not concern the functional form of the amount of exchanged wealth @xmath11 but enters the model through the parameters of the acceptance criterion used by each unit .",
    "we have investigated various forms of distributions @xmath161 .",
    "the equilibrium wealth distributions obtained from _ uniform _ threshold distributions with parameters @xmath162 randomly extracted in an interval @xmath163 in general are not realistic .",
    "an example of such equilibrium wealth distributions obtained for a fixed @xmath164 and different values of @xmath165 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_hetero1 ] .",
    "one can notice that when thresholds are very limited in the range ( all close to @xmath166 in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig_hetero1 ] ) the model is almost homogeneous and one recovers a @xmath39-distribution .",
    "the presence of a significant fraction of agents @xmath26 with higher values of the parameter @xmath162 produces a depletion of the distribution in the intermediate wealth zone and an enhancement of the concentration of units both at small and large values of wealth . in the large - wealth region",
    "one can notice the formation of a new maximum that can be interpreted as the formation of a rich class made of the units with the smallest values of @xmath162 s .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this type of maximum is not observed in real data of wealth distributions .",
    "results reproducing a realistic shape of wealth distributions , are obtained by following a simple recipe consisting in constructing a system in which the majority of units has a standard or low performance during trading interactions and a small fraction of units perform much better .",
    "this prescription was already tested in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the chakraborti - chakrabarti model with saving propensities  @xcite by assigning a zero saving propensity to 99% of the population and higher saving propensities , uniformly distributed in @xmath167 , to the remaining 1% of the population .",
    "this led to realistic shapes of wealth distribution , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the recipe is here adapted to the immediate - exchange model under consideration by assigning a ( fixed ) larger parameter value @xmath168 to a majority ( 95% ) of the population  here a larger value of @xmath84 corresponds to a looser criterion used in accepting an exchange , while the remaining 5% of the population is assigned a set of smaller parameters @xmath162 uniformly extracted in the interval @xmath169 .",
    "the resulting equilibrium wealth distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_hetero2 ] , indeed presents the stylized features of wealth distributions , such as a mode @xmath170 and a pareto power - law at larger values of wealth with a pareto index @xmath171 .",
    "in the present paper we have proposed a model of wealth exchange aimed at overcoming some critics raised about the kinetic exchange models , laying down firmer foundations for the models themselves , and providing a more realistic description of a trade between two economic units .",
    "doing this , two main features of the original models have been modified .",
    "first , an immediate - exchange wealth dynamics has been introduced , describing two actual and distinct wealth flows taking place during the same interaction between two economic units , just as in an actual trade .",
    "models , where the total wealth is randomly reshuffled between the two units or which follow a uni - directional dynamics , better represent exchanges of valuables without the demand of an immediate reward , as , e.g. , in gift economies .",
    "immediate bidirectional exchanges produce more realistic shapes of wealth distribution @xmath172 , such that @xmath173 and having a mode larger than zero .",
    "furthermore , the model is made more realistic at a microeconomic level , allowing units to decide whether to trade or not , according to some criterion based on the profit gained from the trade .",
    "criteria formulated symmetrically with respect to the two trading units  but arbitrary for the rest  preserve some symmetries of the model . in the immediate - exchange models as well as in the dr@xmath57gulescu - yakovenko model ,",
    "a symmetrical criterion _ does not _ change the equilibrium wealth distribution at all .    in the case of the chakraborti - chakrabarti model , when a symmetrical acceptance condition on the _ relative _ wealth is used ,",
    "one still finds that the equilibrium distribution is a @xmath39-distribution , but with a larger value of the shape parameter @xmath100 , corresponding to a higher saving propensity @xmath69 .",
    "this implies interesting links between different kinetic exchange models and provides at the same time a microscopic justification .",
    "for example , the equilibrium distribution of the chakraborti - chakrabarti model can also be obtained from the reshuffling dynamics of the dr@xmath57gulescu - yakovenko model with the addition of an acceptance criterion with suitable parameters .",
    "the situation changes either when the criterion depends asymmetrically on the wealths of the two units ( also in homogeneous systems ) or in the case of heterogeneous systems , where there is anyway a situation of asymmetry due to the fact that each unit uses a different criterion . in these cases",
    "the equilibrium wealth distribution depends on the specific set of criteria used by units .",
    "the heterogeneous version of the bidirectional model presents a wide spectrum of possible shapes for the equilibrium wealth distribution .",
    "we have found that realistic shapes , presenting a pareto power - law , are obtained for moderate levels of heterogeneity .    in order to provide quantitative explanations of the many regularities of and links between the various models discussed above it would be important that future work advances also toward the analytical solution of kinetic exchange models .",
    "furthermore , while the ubiquitous presence of the @xmath39-distribution can be related to the validity of the boltzmann theorem , due to the conservation of wealth during trades , it would be relevant to gain some information also on the analytical shapes of the equilibrium wealth distributions when the boltzmann theorem does not apply , e.g. in the interesting maxwell - demon - type dynamics  @xcite corresponding to cases of asymmetrical acceptance criteria describing e.g. the `` rich gets richer '' effect .",
