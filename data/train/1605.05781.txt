    "the interaction of organic materials and molecules with metal surfaces is of widespread interest to both fundamental science and technology .",
    "the eventual control of the functionality of the formed hybrid inorganic - organic systems ( hioss ) has potential applications to a variety of fields ranging from functionalized surfaces , to organic solar cells  @xcite , molecular electronics  @xcite , nanotechnology  @xcite , and medical implantology  @xcite .",
    "a bottom - up approach of molecular nanotechnology promises a potential route to overcome size limitations of nanoscale devices constructed with traditional top - down approaches such as lithography based device design .",
    "an important prerequisite to such an approach is the ability to control and manipulate the structure and interactions of individual molecular building blocks mounted on well - defined surfaces .",
    "this can only be achieved with the expertise to fully characterize the adsorption geometry and fully understand",
    "the , sometimes subtle , interplay of interactions that lead to a particular molecule - substrate binding strength .",
    "this fundamental aspect has seen a rapid development over the last few years in the surface science context , _",
    "i.e. _ for the adsorption of large and complex organic adsorbates at close to ideal single - crystal surfaces and under the well - defined conditions of ultrahigh vacuum and low temperature  @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", this development has been driven by significant methodological advancements in individual experimental techniques , such as improvements in the resolution of scanning tunneling microscopy - based ( stm ) imaging techniques  @xcite or surface - enhanced raman spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "many of these approaches are used complementary to each other or are being combined to enhance resolution , such as is the case for stm tip - enhanced local raman experiments  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical developments have been driven by advancements in predictive - quality first - principles calculations .",
    "the most important of which in the context of hioss is the efficient incorporation of long - range dispersion interactions into semi - local or hybrid density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite .",
    "when applied to hioss , first - principles calculations face a multitude of challenges , even for single - molecules with simple adsorbate geometry .",
    "localized molecular states of the adsorbate and the delocalized metal band structure have to be described on equal footing , whereas most currently used ( and computationally tractable ) approximations to the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional in dft are optimized to perform well for either one or the other .",
    "this is aggravated by the need to additionally describe dispersive interactions , which are generally not contained in such lower - rung functionals , but can easily play a dominant role _",
    "e.g. _ in the adsorption of conjugated or aromatic molecules .",
    "the resulting interplay of dispersion interactions , wave - function hybridization , pauli repulsion , and charge - transfer at such interfaces demands an efficient and accurate electronic structure description that is able to provide a well - balanced account of this wide range of interactions .",

    "a detailed analysis of this figure can be found in section [ chapter - interpretation ] . based on fig . 1 of ref . .",
    "]    a number of strong contenders to this goal have been suggested , such as the recently developed dft+vdw@xmath0 method  @xcite . however , there is still room for further improvement .",
    "this situation is nicely illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] , which compiles the predictions of the adsorption height and adsorption energy for 3,4,9,10-perylene - tetracarboxylic acid ( ptcda ) adsorbed on ag(111 ) as obtained by a variety of pure and dispersion - corrected xc - functionals ranging from local xc - approximations to non - local correlation based on the random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite . quite symptomatic for hioss in general ,",
    "a wide spread in the predicted quantities is obtained . without an independent experimental reference",
    ", we would thus not be able to unambiguously identify the merits and deficiencies of the individual approximations and models that underlie the methods in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] .",
    "reliable experimental data on geometric structure and energetics of organic - inorganic interfaces are thus urgently needed as a reference for validation and benchmarking of new and improved electronic structure methods .",
    "this reference data must thereby properly match what is calculated .",
    "many experimental techniques to characterize the structure and energetics of hioss are based on probing the statistics of an ensemble of adsorbates .",
    "it is the very complex mixture of adsorbate - surface and lateral adsorbate - adsorbate interactions that drives the aspired self - assembly of hioss that also gives rise to a rich structural phase behavior as a function of temperature and coverage  @xcite .",
    "care has to be taken to compare consistent arrangements at the surface in experiment and theory .",
    "the targeted molecules can furthermore exhibit a pronounced element of flexibility , disorder , and structural anharmonicity  @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to significant finite - temperature effects that also need to be carefully disentangled  @xcite .",
    "a correct interpretation of experiments is therefore of vital importance .",
    "if accomplished , the formulation of well - balanced , diverse sets of benchmark systems can then facilitate methodological improvements as has been shown by the success of the s22 dataset for intermolecular interactions of gas phase molecules  @xcite , or the c21/x16/x23 databases of molecular crystals  @xcite . with the motivation of formulating such a set for hioss",
    ", we review a set of well - characterized systems of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces for which detailed information from experiment and calculations exists .",
    "we start out with an overview of the major experimental techniques which provide reference data regarding molecular geometry and energetics of adsorbates at surfaces .",
    "we then proceed with an overview of the recent advances in dft - based methodologies with a special focus on density - dependent dispersion - inclusive approaches such as the dft+vdw@xmath0 method . following this overview",
    "we exemplify interpretation of electronic structure results using ptcda on ag(111 ) data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] . in the following",
    "we review and analyze the experimental data for the different systems , which range in complexity from rare - gas adatoms to large conjugated aromatics and carbon nanostructures .",
    "based on this data we attempt a first assessment on the current level of accuracy in first - principles calculations of hioss , by using the dft+vdw@xmath0 method .",
    "experimental characterization of hioss in ultra - high vacuum is performed with a vast set of surface science techniques ( see tab .  [ tab - exp ] ) based on topographic surface imaging , spectroscopy , surface scattering , and thermodynamic measurements , all of which complement each other .",
    "imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy ( tem )  @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )  @xcite and atomic force microscopy ( afm )  @xcite play an important role in the initial characterization of adsorbate overlayers at surfaces . in the case of tem",
    "the growth mode , surface reconstruction , the approximate thickness of and phase boundaries between adsorbate overlayers can be measured .",
    "whereas atomic - level resolution in tem can be achieved by now  @xcite , structural analysis on the single molecule level is still difficult .",
    "such resolution can , however , be achieved for molecular adsorbates using stm and afm .",
    "this gives the ability to define a model of single molecule adsorbate structure and , in combination with low - energy electron diffraction ( leed )  @xcite , also to construct a model of the periodic surface structure and surface unit cell .",
    "recent advances due to tip - functionalization with small molecules  @xcite have significantly increased the applicability and lateral resolution of afm  @xcite , which is sometimes even referred to as `` sub - atomic resolution afm ''  @xcite .",
    "complementary to the information given by these diffraction and imaging techniques , surface spectroscopy methods such as x - ray photoemission ( xps )  @xcite , x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) , ultraviolet photoemission ( ups ) , and two - photon photoemission ( 2ppe ) yield information about the changes in electronic structure along with the nature and extent of the interaction between adsorbate and substrate .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the adsorption geometry and adsorption energy of an adsorbate on a surface is determined by a number of different contributions : ( 1 ) long - range correlations such as dispersion interaction between adsorbate and surface , ( 2 ) covalent contributions between chemically active groups at closer distance , ( 3 ) the energetic penalty due to geometrical distortion upon adsorption , ( 4 ) the pauli exchange repulsion due to overlapping electron densities , and ( 5 ) the attractive or repulsive lateral interactions between adsorbates .",
    "all of the above contributions have to be accounted for to arrive at an accurate electronic structure description of hioss .",
    "the set of systems we have presented in this work covers a large spectrum of interactions , ranging from pure dispersion interactions in the case of rare - gas atoms to highly flexible island - forming heteroaromatic compounds such as azobenzene . in the following",
    "we will quantify the reliability of the dft+vdw@xmath0 method in describing these systems in terms of the mean absolute deviation ( mad ) from the above presented experimental reference values ( see supplemental material ) .",
    "metal surface - adsorbed rare - gas atoms , such as xenon provide the case of pure dispersion interactions of a single atom with a polarizable surface .",
    "this is the case for which the vdw@xmath0 method is set out to perform well , which it in fact does throughout the studied surfaces .",
    "adsorption heights are within a mad of 0.06   from experiment , with the closest agreement in the case of cu(110 ) and the largest deviation ( 0.14   ) in the case of cu(111 ) .",
    "the same holds for adsorption energies with a mad of 0.03  ev or 0.8 kcal / mol and the largest error ( 0.06  ev ) , again , in the case of cu(111 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a relative error of 12  % with respect to the magnitude of adsorption energies .",
    "aromatic adsorbates such as benzene and naphthalene introduce additional aspects such as covalent contributions and geometrical distortions on reactive surfaces such as pt(111 ) and a more spatially polarizable electron distribution through the aromatic @xmath1-conjugation of the molecule .",
    "based on the few cases , where experimental references on the adsorption geometry exist ( bz / ag(111 ) and bz / pt(111 ) ) , dft+vdw@xmath0 appears to correctly describe these systems .",
    "the corresponding mad of 0.06   is comparable to the accuracy achieved for xenon adsorption on metals .",
    "however , the description of the adsorption energy with dft+vdw@xmath0 is significantly worse ( mad of 0.23  ev ) . throughout all systems dft+vdw@xmath0 leads to overbinding of the adsorbate , which is more pronounced for the larger np than for bz . for the latter",
    "the mad is only 0.09  ev .",
    "this may be an indication that the complex long - range interaction of the polarizable adsorbate / substrate complex can not be mapped onto effective pairwise - additive contributions .",
    "the overbinding as observed for small and intermediate aromatic molecules seems to be somewhat decoupled from the description of the adsorption geometry .",
    "this becomes more evident for the adsorption of extended and compacted nanostructures such as dip and c@xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , no experimentally measured adsorption energies exist , however the accuracy of dft+vdw@xmath0 in describing the adsorption height of these systems is equivalent to the above systems and is reflected in an mad in adsorption height of 0.05   .",
    "heteroaromatic adsorbates with functional groups that feature lone pairs and unsaturated bonds between carbon and oxygen , sulfur , or nitrogen introduce additional complexity . upon adsorption",
    "these heteroatoms will bond differently to the surface than the carbon backbone .",
    "functional groups with sulfur and oxygen for example may engage in surface bonds that are stronger than the average c  metal interaction . on the other hand nitrogen atoms may exhibit an overall weaker interaction .    for thiophene ",
    "metal adsorption we find the adsorbate structure to be dominated by the strong s  metal bond which has a shorter distance to the surface than the ideal vertical adsorption height of the aromatic backbone of the molecule .",
    "the result is a tilted , flexible adsorption geometry that may vary considerably as a function of coverage and temperature . for the low - coverage cases with little tilt angle that we reviewed here , dft+vdw@xmath0 , performs similarly as for benzene and naphthalene .",
    "the deviation in adsorption height for thp on cu(111 ) is 0.16   and the mad in adsorption energy for the three coinage metal substrates is 0.14  ev when compared to experimental adsorption energies extracted from tpd _ via _ the redhead technique . at this point",
    "it should be mentioned that this method of calculating the adsorption energy from the desorption temperature and a range of assumed pre - exponential factors is highly disputed and only used due to lack of more recent measurements .",
    "more accurate experimental reference values are in dire need .    in the case of ptcda , a molecule with a conjugated backbone and terminal di - oxo anhydride groups , adsorbed on different facets of coinage metal surfaces , we find two strongly different spatially separated chemical moieties .",
    "the terminal oxo groups engage with the surface in a covalent bond , whereas the interaction of backbone and surface is mainly dominated by dispersion interactions .",
    "the active terminal groups in addition lead to lateral interactions that enable a multitude of different stable overlayer phases .",
    "however , even for this rather complicated case dft+vdw@xmath0 yields an mad in adsorption height of 0.08   that is comparable to the above systems featuring considerably simpler chemistry .",
    "the largest deviation can be found for the o ",
    "cu distance in ptcda / cu(111 ) with a discrepancy of 0.19   when compared to experiment .",
    "an experimental estimate for the adsorption energy only exists for ptcda / au(111 ) , which is overestimated by dft+vdw@xmath0 by 0.22  ev .",
    "the adsorption energy of ptcda / ag(111 ) has recently been estimated from tpd measurements of a smaller analogue called ntcda  @xcite to be in the range of 1.4 to 2.1  ev .",
    "the dft+vdw@xmath0 value for dilute coverage is larger than this estimate .",
    "however , there are several different disputed estimates in literatute  @xcite .",
    "an accurate experimental reference value for the adsorption energy of ptcda on ag(111 ) that can settle this dispute remains to be measured .",
    "another important aspect of functional groups on the adsorption of aromatic molecules is the emergence of lateral intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds . in the case of ptcda ,",
    "the carboxylic oxygens in the molecule form hydrogen bonds with the neighboring molecules and thereby generate the herringbone pattern that is characteristic of the monolayer formation of ptcda on coinage metals .",
    "this fact is initially independent of the interaction with the substrate since ptcda forms crystals with layered molecular stacks in which the ordering pattern of the molecules in each layer is that of a herringbone arrangement closely related to the one found in the monolayer .",
    "there is , nevertheless , an effect on the ordering of the monolayer on each substrate which depends on the adsorbate - substrate interaction .",
    "this can be related to the degree of commensurability between the lattice parameters of the substrate bulk and those of the stacking layer of the organic crystal .",
    "this leads to the formation of a commensurate monolayer on ag(111 ) and a point - on - line coincidence on au(111 ) . in the case of cu(111 ) , the mismatch leads to different adsorption sites for oxygen atoms yielding a different distortion in each molecule forming the monolayer , which is reflected in the large discrepancy between experiment and calculation and the low coherent fraction for the carboxylic oxygens found in the nixsw experiments  @xcite .",
    "metal - adsorbed ptcda also nicely exemplifies the importance of intermolecular interactions and their contribution to the total adsorption energy . as shown above the adsorption energy",
    "varies strongly as a function of coverage and a correct simulation model of the experimental overlayer structure is extremely important to arrive at an accurate first - principles adsorption energy .",
    "contrary to the cases of thp and ptcda , the diazo groups in ab and tba do not strongly interact with ag(111 ) and",
    "au(111 ) surfaces and also contribute to the @xmath1-conjugation of the molecule .",
    "more importantly , the central azo bridge in the molecule makes it inherently flexible , which translates into a strongly anharmonic binding component in the adsorbate / substrate complex  @xcite .",
    "the result is a strong temperature dependence of adsorbate geometry and energetics and a large discrepancy in both height and adsorption energy .",
    "mads for ab and tba 0  k adsorption models are 0.57   and 0.68  ev , respectively , when compared to finite - temperature experimental results . whereas anharmonic finite - temperature correction of the adsorbate geometry  @xcite leads to an excellent agreement of simulated and measured adsorption height , the adsorption energy remains 0.31  ev overestimated  a deviation that is in line with the above studied systems .    when we combine the dft+vdw@xmath0 results for the whole dataset of vertical adsorption heights and adsorption energies we arrive at mads of 0.11   and 0.26  ev",
    "however , if we exclude the 0  k models of metal - adsorbed ab and tba and only include the finite - temperature corrected",
    "ab / ag(111 ) the mads are 0.06   for 23 different vertical adsorption heights and 0.16  ev for 17 different adsorption energies ( see supplemental material for details ) .",
    "the latter results reflect the same accuracy throughout the dataset and support the assessment that dft+vdw@xmath0 yields a reliable description of adsorption geometries , however , at the same time appears to systematically overestimate adsorption energetics of systems more complex than rare - gas atoms .",
    "the here presented dataset of 23 vertical adsorption heights and 17 adsorption energies of different hioss establishes a comprehensive benchmark and may serve as a tool for the assessment of current and future electronic structure methods .",
    "we have presented results for the structure and stability of a series of hioss using a dispersion - inclusive dft - based method that can reliably describe a wide range of interactions including covalent bonding , electrostatic interactions , pauli repulsion , and vdw interactions .",
    "the noticeable improvement in the calculation of adsorption distances and energies that we have observed with the dft+vdw@xmath0 method compared to other pairwise - additive dispersion - corrected methods indicates the importance of the inclusion of the collective screening effects present in the substrate for the calculation of vdw interactions , with particular importance in the case of organic - metal interfaces . from a general perspective , however , there are still many important aspects left to consider in order to achieve both quantitative and predictive power in the simulation of the structure and stability of complex interfaces .    throughout the here discussed dataset",
    ", dft+vdw@xmath0 yields a slight overestimation of adsorption energies .",
    "we relate this to the fact that the complex adsorbate / substrate interactions in systems beyond simple rare - gas atoms can not be effectively captured in a pairwise - additive dispersion scheme and a more explicit account of many - body long - range correlation contributions is necessary .",
    "this could be achieved by incorporating the collective response of the combined adsorbate / substrate system , rather than the effective inclusion of the substrate response alone .",
    "@xcite high - level quantum - chemistry methods or many - body methods such as the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the correlation energy could be used for this purpose .",
    "these approaches , however , either perform well for isolated molecules or periodic surfaces , but are rarely applicable for the combined system .",
    "recent results on xe and ptcda adsorption at ag(111 )  @xcite suggest that the many - body description of dispersion interactions at the level of the dft+mbd method  @xcite may be an efficient approach to remedy the intrinsic overbinding in dft+vdw@xmath0 .",
    "the dft+mbd method may thereby significantly improve the description of adsorption energies , geometries of flexible systems , and vibrational properties of hioss .",
    "another equally important challenge for future methods will be a more sophisticated account of local correlation and exchange effects beyond a semi - local exchange - correlation treatment .",
    "range - separated hybrid functionals  @xcite , screened second order exchange methods  @xcite , and recent many - body perturbation theory approaches  @xcite in combination with methods that provide long - range dispersion interactions may provide the necessary accuracy to correctly reproduce the charge - distribution at the molecule / surface interface , the molecular level alignment , and the correct surface potential decay .",
    "the here reviewed representative set of 23 adsorption heights and 17 adsorption energies for hioss may provide a useful tool in evaluation and assessment of methodological improvements and may also be extended to measurable electronic , vibrational , and spectroscopic properties . for this dataset",
    ", the pbe+vdw@xmath0 method yields a mad in adsorption height of 0.06   and a mad in adsorption energy of 0.16  ev ( 3.7  kcal / mol ) and represents the current state - of - the - art in electronic structure description of hioss .",

    "<S> adsorption geometry and stability of organic molecules on surfaces are key parameters that determine the observable properties and functions of hybrid inorganic / organic systems ( hioss ) . despite many recent advances in precise experimental characterization and improvements in first - principles electronic structure methods , reliable databases of structures and energetics for large adsorbed molecules are largely amiss . in this review , </S>",
    "<S> we present such a database for a range of molecules adsorbed on metal single - crystal surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the systems we analyze include noble - gas atoms , conjugated aromatic molecules , carbon nanostructures , and heteroaromatic compounds adsorbed on five different metal surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the overall objective is to establish a diverse benchmark dataset that enables an assessment of current and future electronic structure methods , and motivates further experimental studies that provide ever more reliable data . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the benchmark structures and energetics from experiment are here compared with the recently developed van der waals ( vdw ) inclusive density - functional theory ( dft ) method , dft+vdw@xmath0 . in comparison to 23 adsorption heights and 17 adsorption energies from experiment we find a mean average deviation of 0.06   and 0.16  ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the dft+vdw@xmath0 method as an accurate and efficient approach to treat hioss . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed discussion identifies remaining challenges to be addressed in future development of electronic structure methods , for which the here presented benchmark database may serve as an important reference .    </S>"
