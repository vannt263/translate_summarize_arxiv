    "we consider the case of large filling factors @xmath14 separately in subsection  [ subsec : large_nu ] because it is qualitatively different from that of @xmath15 .",

    "therefore , there exists an extensive range of interactions ( defined by the condition @xmath17 ) , in which the system remains superfluid , but its on - site number distribution is drastically squeezed before the sf - mi can take place .",

    "as the interaction strength is increased , we observe a gradual squeezing of the on - site number distribution and the emergence of the symmetry between particle- and hole - like fluctuations , characteristic of a mi . in this section , we also present numerical data for the case of large filling factors and demonstrate that the analysis of subsection  [ subsec : large_nu ] is applicable already at @xmath27 .",

    "are of quantum nature and can be efficiently controlled externally through the lattice parameters , whereas temperatures comparable to the mott excitation gap destroy the insulating state by activating particle - hole excitations . at the moment",
    ", there are no experimental techniques to measure the temperature of a strongly interacting system . unlike in the weakly interacting regime , where the temperature can be straightforwardly extracted from the momentum distribution ( e.g. , from the interference pattern of matter waves or from the condensate fraction observed after the trap is released and the gas expands freely ) , in the strongly correlated regime , both temperature and interatomic interaction are responsible for filling the higher momentum states making standard absorption imaging techniques inapplicable .",
    "the idea of using occupation number distributions to estimate the temperature was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , where in was argued that the temperature dependence of the total number of pairs and their spatial distribution ( in traps ) provides a sensitive method of thermometry deeply in the mi phase at energies smaller than the interatomic interaction , but much larger than the effective hopping between the sites .",
