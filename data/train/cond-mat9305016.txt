    "polymers are known to develop various forms , for example linear chains , stars , rings , combs , ladders , three - dimensional networks and branched polymers .",
    "all these kinds of polymers have linear chains between the branching point .",
    "the kind of two - dimensional polymers we are studying are compact sheets of monomers , which are linked together periodically with respect to two dimensions . between the branching points there is no chain and the polymers are highly organized sheets .    the successful `` in bulk '' synthesis of such two - dimensional polymers was reported recently @xcite .",
    "stupp et al . polymerized self - organized bilayers by two different so - called stitching reactions , which act within three distinct levels of the bilayer .",
    "each oligomer can not have more than two bonds within a layer .",
    "in addition , not all possible bonds are present , because the stitching reactivity is about 30 to 50% at the upper and lower layer ( 90% within the middle layer ) .",
    "is it possible to form a two - dimensional polymer instead of an ensemble of ladder polymers ? what is the minimal reaction rate , needed for large two - dimensional polymers ?",
    "what kind of structures will be developed at different reaction rates ?",
    "these are questions , which can be answered by percolation theory @xcite .",
    "one of the most important results of percolation theory @xcite is related to `` universality '' , if the system has short ranged interactions .",
    "all presently available evidence strongly suggests , that the critical exponents depend on the dimensionality of the lattice only  but not on the lattice structure , boundary conditions and so on .",
    "the exponents for bond or site percolation , for square , triangular or honeycomb lattices etc .",
    "are the same .",
    "we therefore would expect , that the clusters produced with the above cited stitching reaction also may be described by these exponents .    does there exist a large ( `` infinite '' ) cluster of bonded sites ? to answer this question , we define the fraction of sites in the largest cluster @xmath0 and the probability @xmath1 , that there is a `` spanning cluster '' of bonds , which connects two opposite boundarys of the underlying lattice . then for an infinite lattice , @xmath0 is expected to vanish for @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the probability , that a bond is present , and @xmath5 is the percolation threshold , above which an infinite cluster exists . with @xmath6 clusters of size @xmath7 ( number of polymers )",
    "the mean size of the finite clusters is related to the percolation susceptibility @xmath8 ( omnitting the largest ( `` infinite '' ) cluster ) @xmath9 which diverges at @xmath5 as @xmath10      stupp et al .",
    "@xcite suggest , that they synthesized large two - dimensional polymers .",
    "obviously , the effective reaction rate of the stitching reaction has to be larger than the percolation threshold @xmath5 , if one wants to synthesize large sheets instead of ladder polymers .",
    "since @xmath5 is not universal , we use a simple but sufficient model of the two - dimensional polymer , to compute @xmath5 .",
    "in addition we will measure the exponents .      at the middle layer , the reaction rate was 100% , i.e. all allowed bonds ( two can react )",
    "were occupied . for that purpose",
    ", the bonds of the triangular lattice were choosen successively at random .",
    "if the number of bonds of each polymer was less than 2 , the randomly choosen bond was occupied .",
    "then we stitched the upper and lower layer using the same algorithm , until @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) bonds were occupied .",
    "@xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the number of occupied bonds of the middle layer @xmath16 times the stitching probability ( reaction rate ) @xmath4 of the upper and lower layer .",
    "note , that @xmath16 is not determined by the linear lattice size @xmath17 , but may vary slightly for each configuration .",
    "because of the restriction , that each polymer may be stitched to at most two neighbours , we do not expect an infinite cluster or percolation at @xmath18 , i.e. without bonds at the upper and lower layer , but an ensemble of linear polymer chains .",
    "on the contrary , at @xmath19 all allowed bonds at all three layers are occupied , resulting in an effective coordination number larger than two .",
    "it is worth noting , that even at @xmath19 the probability , that there is only one cluster containing all polymers , vanishes with increasing system size @xmath17 . within this model",
    ", it is very unlikely to prepare very large perfect two - dimensional polymers .",
    "if we want to answer the question , if a reaction rate of about @xmath20% is high enough to prepare infinite clusters , we have to determine the percolation threshold .",
    "as noted , the value of @xmath5 is not universal , but depends strongly on the used lattice and bond restrictions . an unbiased way to estimate",
    "@xmath5 is to plot the probability @xmath1 of the occurence of a spanning cluster as a function of @xmath4 for different lattice sizes @xcite .",
    "the finite size scaling relation for @xmath1 simply reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the scaling function and @xmath23 the correlation length . as a consequence , different curves @xmath24 for different choices of @xmath17 should intersect at @xmath11 in a common intersection point @xmath25 , apart from corrections to scaling and a bias by the choice of the critical exponents .",
    "figure  [ fig : fss_p_s ] shows this plot for the stitching reaction described above .    from this figure",
    "we get one of our main result , the percolation threshold @xmath26 .",
    "hence it follows , that the reaction rate of 30% to 50% reported by stupp et al .",
    "@xcite was high enough ( within the limits of our percolation model ) to prepare an `` infinite '' two - dimensional polymer .",
    "does the percolation of the stitching reaction lie in the same universality class as the standard bond percolation ?",
    "figure  [ fig : fss_m ] shows a finite size scaling plot of @xmath0 using the assumed exact values for @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath5 obtained from the spanning probability .",
    "apart from small deviations of the smallest system far from @xmath5 , the system sizes simulated seem to be in the scaling regime .",
    "the maximal values of @xmath8 vary by orders of magnitude in this range of @xmath17 !    finally , we are interested in the geometric properties of the cluster structure , particularly at the percolation threshold @xmath5 . at",
    "@xmath5 the largest ( spanning ) cluster should form a fractal with hausdorff dimension @xmath30 .",
    "this quantity can be defined with the number of polymers @xmath31 within a sphere of radius @xmath32 and the relation @xmath33 using the data of @xmath34 configurations of a @xmath35 hexagon at @xmath5 , which is shown in figure  [ fig : d_h ] , we measured @xmath36 in good agreement with the result of percolation theory @xmath37 .",
    "apart from the largest cluster , there are many smaller ones . because of the statistical nature of their structure , we restrict ourselves to the number @xmath6 of clusters of size @xmath7 ( which is the number of polymers ) , which is expected to decrease as a power of @xmath7 . within the accuracy of the data , the power law seems to be fulfilled in figure  [ fig : cluhis ] . although the fisher epxonent @xmath38 is somewhat smaller than the expected one @xmath39 .",
    "most probably this is due to the finiteness of the system .",
    "quality data @xcite showed , that @xmath6 is less than the expected power law for small @xmath7 and higher for the largest @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we underestimated @xmath40 systematically ."
