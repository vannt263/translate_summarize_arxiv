    "recent results ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ; riess et al . 1998 ) from the observation of high - redshift type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have driven a renewed interest towards cosmological scenarios where the bulk of the energy density is made up of some unknown negative - pressure component ( named `` dark energy '' in the recent literature ) . among the possibilities that have been proposed to explain the nature of this component is the existence of a non - zero cosmological constant ( constant vacuum energy ) . a more general way to describe",
    "this component is by its equation of state @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "this allows for a whole set of candidates with different values of @xmath6 . among them",
    "is a dynamical form of time varying , spatially inhomogeneous dark energy component , generally provided by a slowly rolling scalar field , referred to as `` quintessence '' ( caldwell et al .",
    "the most attractive feature of quintessence models is their capability to solve the so - called ` cosmic coincidence ' problem , namely the fact that matter and vacuum energy contribute by comparable amounts to the energy density today .",
    "successful quintessence models should in fact allow for the existence of attractor ( ratra & peebles 1988 ) or ` tracker ' ( zlatev et al .",
    "1999 ) solutions , which make the present - day behavior of the scalar field nearly independent of its initial conditions ( e.g. wang et al . 2000 , for a thorough review ) .",
    "it has been noticed ( see , e.g. , perlmutter , turner & white 1999 ) that it may be difficult for sne ia data alone to discriminate among different candidates for the dark energy . complementing these data with those coming from other observations",
    "may help assessing the nature of the dark energy component .",
    "study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy has long been recognized as a powerful tool to investigate cosmological models .",
    "the recent outstanding achievements of the maxima-1 and boomerang-98 experiments ( hanany et al .",
    "2000 ; de bernardis et al . 2000 ) have finally moved us closer to the goal of a long awaited high precision measurement of the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "the cmb power spectrum measurements by maxima-1 and boomerang-98 are in remarkable agreement , and have already been used to set constraints on the values of a suite of cosmological parameters within the class of inflationary adiabatic models ( jaffe et al .",
    "2000 ; balbi et al .",
    "2000 ; lange et al .",
    "these results , which strongly support a universe with a density very close to critical , made the case for the existence of dark energy even stronger .",
    "in fact , large scale structure observations indicate that matter with strong clustering properties can only make up to @xmath7 of the critical density , leaving room for a @xmath8 contribution from dark energy .",
    "it is then timely to use these new cmb datasets to explore in more detail the nature of the dark energy .",
    "a comparison between quintessence models and recent cmb data has been performed by brax et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; they investigated the dependence of cmb power spectrum ( in particular the location and height of acoustic features ) on the main cosmological parameters as well as on different quintessence potentials .",
    "the predicted cmb anisotropy is then compared to boomerang-98 and maxima-1 , finding general agreement .",
    "a likelihood analysis of the boomerang-98 results for theories involving couplings of the quintessence field with other cosmological components has been carried on by amendola ( 2000 ) , finding again broad compatibility with the data . in this _",
    "letter _ we focus on the quintessence scenario , and use the cmb power spectrum from maxima-1 and boomerang-98 to set limits to the parameters of this model .",
    "these are the present - day closure energy density of the quintessence component , @xmath0 , and the quantity @xmath9 , characterizing its equation of state .",
    "we have purposely restricted our analysis to the simplest class of inflationary theories , namely flat models with scale - invariant adiabatic scalar perturbations .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a quick review of the key features of the quintessence scenario , with a particular emphasis to the theoretical predictions for the cmb angular power spectrum . in section 3",
    "we use the maxima-1 and boomerang-98 power spectrum measurements to constrain the parameters of the model .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in section 4 .",
    "the quintessence component is usually described as an ultra - light ( its compton wavelength being of the same order or larger than the hubble radius ) self - interacting scalar field @xmath10 , with negative pressure .",
    "it is invoked to provide the accelerated expansion of the universe today in alternative to the ordinary cosmological constant . in this scenario ,",
    "the vacuum energy is stored in the potential energy @xmath11 of the @xmath10 field , evolving through the classical klein - gordon equation . a suitable period of slow - rolling in the scalar field dynamics allows to reproduce a behavior similar to a cosmological constant , which in turn requires that the potential should admit a rather flat region .",
    "several candidates have been proposed in recent years in the particle physics context ( e.g. masiero , pietroni & rosati 2000 , and refs . therein ) . in this letter",
    "we focus on quintessence models with inverse power - law potentials , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , as originally suggested by ratra & peebles ( 1988 ) .",
    "the large interest in quintessence models is due to their capability to avoid the severe fine - tuning on the smallness of the vacuum energy compared with matter and radiation in the early universe : a large class of field trajectories , named `` tracking solutions '' ( zlatev et al .",
    "1999 ) , are able to set the @xmath10 energy at the observed value today starting from a very wide set of initial conditions ; among others , ratra - peebles - type potentials do satisfy this requirement ( liddle & scherrer 1999 ) .    for a given class of potentials , quintessence models can be parametrized by two quantities : the scalar field closure energy density today , @xmath14 , and its equation of state at the present time , @xmath15_{t_0}$ ] , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the field pressure and energy density , respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath18 for a pure cosmological constant , but can be larger for scalar field component . in particular , in the tracking regime @xmath19 at low redshifts , thus reducing to the ordinary cosmological constant for @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , there is a one - to - one relation between @xmath1 and the potential exponent @xmath21 : @xmath22 : the larger @xmath23 , the greater the inverse potential exponent @xmath21 .",
    "however , one must be aware that , although useful for a qualitative understanding , the above relations are only approximately satisfied at present , since the quintessence field is dominating and the tracking regime is being abandoned .",
    "even though the @xmath10 field is too relativistic to cluster on sub - horizon scales , its dynamics induces relevant imprints on cosmological scales .",
    "the scales beyond the horizon at decoupling are depicted on the low-@xmath24 tail of the cmb anisotropy angular power spectrum ; the quintessence dynamics acts on these scales through the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ; e.g. hu , sugiyama & silk 1997 ) . also , the @xmath10 component participates in the overall expansion of the universe , causing a geometric effect that translates into a projection of each physical scale onto different angles in the sky .",
    "moreover , since its energy density was largely subdominant at decoupling , the form of the acoustic peaks region of the cmb spectrum at @xmath25 is not altered .    for a given value of the vacuum energy density today",
    ", the effects of a quintessence component , compared to the cosmological constant , can be qualitatively understood by considering the dark energy equation of state . when moving away from @xmath26 , the first effect that is important",
    "is the projection one : the size of the last scattering surface gets reduced because in the past the quintessence energy density was larger than that of a cosmological constant : this determines a shift of all the cmb features to larger scales , or smaller multipoles .",
    "in addition , the more @xmath23 deviates from @xmath27 , the earlier is the time when @xmath10 starts to dominate the cosmic expansion ; through the isw effect , the cmb photons are sensitive to the dynamics of the gravitational potential wells and hills along their trajectories , which in turn decay much more rapidly , reflecting the dominance of the vacuum energy .",
    "this enhances the level of cmb anisotropies on the low @xmath24 s tail of the spectrum , where one should consider the limitations introduced by cosmic variance , when dealing with the isw power .",
    "however , for the tracking solutions analysed here , the variation in the power spectrum introduced by the isw for @xmath28 is larger than the uncertainty due to cosmic variance .",
    "cmb anisotropy angular power spectra in the considered class of quintessence models have been obtained by suitably modifying cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) to include @xmath10 perturbations in the synchronous gauge , as detailed in perrotta & baccigalupi ( 1999 ) , and numerically evolving the background quantities , accounting for the tracker scalar field trajectories , as discussed in baccigalupi , matarrese & perrotta ( 2000 ) , where results were presented for some specific values of the quintessence parameters .    0.5 cm 0.5 cm fig .",
    "1. data points used in the analysis .",
    "the full circles are the bandpowers from maxima-1 , the open circles are from boomerang-98 .",
    "these data have been re - scaled within their 1@xmath29 calibration uncertainties .",
    "the open boxes are the cobe / dmr data .",
    "the curves are the theoretical predictions from quintessence models which best fit the combined data when we allow the physical baryon density to vary in the range @xmath30 ( continuous line , corresponding to @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) or we fix it at the big bang nucleosynthesis value @xmath34 ( dashed line , corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath32 )",
    "in this section we compare the predictions of quintessence models to the results of the first flight of the maxima  experiment ( maxima-1 ; hanany et al .",
    "2000 ) and of the long duration antarctic flight of boomerang  ( boomerang-98 ; de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) . to rule out models in the 2-dimensional space of quintessence parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 )",
    ", we adopted a bayesian approach , estimating the probability distribution of the parameters by evaluating the likelihood of the data , @xmath36 .",
    "the data we used are the maxima-1 spectrum , estimated in 10 bins covering the range @xmath37 , and the boomerang-98 spectrum , estimated in 12 bins , over the range @xmath38 . within each bin",
    ", the power spectrum is parameterized by a flat bandpower : @xmath39 .",
    "we used the published bandpowers and neglected the effect of bin - bin correlations ( which should be small , see hanany et al .",
    "2000 , de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the offset - lognormal corrections to the likelihood , since these have not been made public yet . following jaffe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we combined the maxima-1 and boomerang-98 adjusting the calibration of each dataset by a factor @xmath40 for maxima-1 and @xmath41 for boomerang-98 .",
    "we extended the low @xmath24 s coverage of the dataset by including in our analysis the cobe / dmr power spectrum estimated over 8 bins in the range @xmath42 by tegmark & hamilton ( 1997 ) .",
    "the band powers used in the analysis are shown in figure  1 .",
    "since the aim of this work is to focus specifically on the quintessence parameters space , we did not embark in a multi - dimensional fit such as those already performed in lange et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , balbi et al . ( 2000 ) , jaffe et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "we intentionally decided to restrict our analysis to the most basic set of inflationary adiabatic models , namely those with a flat geometry ( @xmath43 ) and a scale - invariant spectrum of primordial fluctuations ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "furthermore this class of inflationary models is precisely the one which seems to be favored by the current multi - parameter cmb analyses ( see also , e.g. , kinney , melchiorri & riotto , 2000 ) .",
    "we treated the overall normalization of the power spectrum as a free parameter , and for each model we adjusted it to the value which gave the best fit to our data .",
    "we fixed the value of the hubble constant at @xmath45  km  s@xmath46  mpc@xmath46 , which is consistent with most of the observations ( freedman 1999 ) .",
    "we assumed that reionization occurred late enough to have a negligible effect on the power spectrum ( corresponding to an optical depth @xmath47 ) .",
    "finally , we did not include the effect of massive neutrinos ( which would be very small anyway ) and of tensor modes ( gravitational waves ) .",
    "we only made an exception to our strategy of using very tight priors in the case of the physical baryon density @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the hubble constant in units of 100  km  s@xmath46  mpc@xmath46 ) , since the value @xmath50 deduced from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) considerations using the measured deuterium abundances ( burles et al .",
    "1998 ) seems to conflict with the value @xmath51 ( jaffe et al . 2000 ) emerging from the already mentioned analyses of the cmb datasets ( see also esposito et al .",
    "then , in order to test the importance of this discrepancy in our analysis , we allowed the physical baryon density to vary in the range @xmath30 , which encompasses a more conservative range consistent with high and low deuterium abundances measurements . in this case our results were obtained by marginalizing ( integrating ) the likelihood over @xmath48 .",
    "our results are shown in figure  2 where we plot the 68% and 95% confidence levels in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "when we let @xmath48 vary , we are able to find quintessence models which are an excellent fit to our data .",
    "we point out that most of the weight to the likelihood is provided by models with @xmath52",
    ". indeed , marginalizing over @xmath48 or fixing it at @xmath53 give almost exactly the same result .",
    "the best fit is a model with @xmath31 , @xmath54 , @xmath33 , having @xmath55/dof=26/27 ( where dof indicates the degrees of freedom , resulting from 30 data points and 3 parameters ) .",
    "if we fix the physical baryon density to the bbn value @xmath34 , the bounds we obtain in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane are qualitatively similar to those of , e.g. , perlmutter , turner & white ( 1999 ) , efstathiou ( 1999 ) , wang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . however , we stress the fact that none of the models with @xmath34 provides a good fit to the data .",
    "in fact , the best fit , with @xmath35 and @xmath32 , has @xmath55/dof=38/27 .",
    "qualitatively , we found that increasing @xmath48 has the effect of moving the best fit to lower values of @xmath0 , in a roughly linear fashion , while @xmath1 remains roughly constant at @xmath56 .",
    "the best fit models with @xmath57 and @xmath58 are compared to the data in figure  1 .",
    "0.5 cm 0.5 cm fig .",
    "2. likelihood contours at @xmath59 and @xmath60 confidence level in the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "the shaded regions are obtained marginalizing over @xmath61 in the range @xmath30 . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed contours show the bounds obtained imposing the big bang nucleosynthesis value @xmath34 .",
    "0.5 cm 0.5 cm    in figure  3 we show the projected likelihood functions for the individual quintessence parameters , obtained by marginalization of the 2-dimensional likelihood with respect to each parameter .",
    "a robust indication , quite independent of the value of @xmath48 , is that although pure cosmological constant models ( @xmath18 ) are compatible with the cmb data used here , pure quintessence models ( @xmath62 ) seem to be slightly favored .",
    "this appears to agree with the qualitative discussion of brax , martin & riazuelo ( 2000 ) .",
    "the peak location in models with @xmath62 is shifted to the left with respect to models with @xmath18 , resulting in better agreement with the data .",
    "in fact , this mechanism allows one to find quintessence models with @xmath63 which have the same peaks locations of non - quintessence models with a @xmath64 slightly larger than unity .",
    "if we impose @xmath18 , we get a best fit with @xmath65 and @xmath57 with @xmath66dof=28/27 ( @xmath67 if we impose @xmath34 , with @xmath55/dof=40/27 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that these data seem to disfavor high values of @xmath0 , unless we impose the bbn constraint on @xmath48 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that this result is influenced by the assumptions we made on the value of the other parameters . relaxing the priors would result in higher upper bounds on @xmath0 , similar to those found in lange et al .",
    "( 2000 ) or jaffe et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "we used the recent cmb power spectrum measurements from maxima-1 and boomerang-98 , combined with cobe / dmr , to investigate the quintessence models in the context of flat , scale - invariant , inflationary adiabatic models .",
    "the maxima-1 and boomerang-98 data already provide interesting insights on the equation of state of the universe .",
    "the simplest class of inflationary models , with quintessence , together with economic assumptions on the other parameters , provide an excellent fit to these cmb data .",
    "in fact , quintessence models seem to be slightly favored over simple cosmological constant models .    in this _",
    "letter _ we restricted our attention to the simplest class of quintessence potentials , having the ratra - peebles @xmath68 form . within this class of models",
    "one can already conclude that shallower potentials ( @xmath69 ) are favored by current cmb anisotropy data .",
    "also , we did not analyze here the case when the scalar field providing the dark energy today is non - minimally coupled to the gravitational sector of the theory , as it happens in the ` extended quintessence ' scenario ( perrotta , baccigalupi & matarrese 2000 ; baccigalupi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we did not compare explicitly the constraints on the equation of state coming from high - redshift sne ia observations ( perlmutter , turner & white 1999 ; garnavich et al .",
    "1998 ) with the results of our analysis , because of our choice of considering a range of values for @xmath48 not limited to the standard bbn value .",
    "clearly , high precision sne ia distance measurements such as those expected to come from the proposed snap satellite will provide powerful constraints on quintessence models complementary to those of the map and planck cmb missions .",
    "similar complementary information will come from measurements of the comoving density of galaxy clusters ( haiman , mohr & holder 2000 ) .",
    "thus , one will be able to put severe constraints not only on the nature of the dark energy , but also on the structure of the theory of gravity ."
