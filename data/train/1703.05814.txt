    "[ [ background ] ] background + + + + + + + + + +    problem , known as a thermodynamical model of liquid - solid phase transition , has been widely studied since jeseph stefan s work in 1889@xcite .",
    "typical applications include sea ice melting and freezing @xcite , continuous casting of steel @xcite , crystal - growth @xcite , thermal energy storage system @xcite , and lithium - ion batteries @xcite .",
    "for instance , time evolution of the arctic sea ice thickness and temperature profile was modeled in @xcite using the stefan problem , and the correspondence with the empirical data was investigated .",
    "apart from the thermodynamical model , the stefan problem has been employed to model a type of population growth , such as in @xcite for tumor growth process and in @xcite for information diffusion on social networks .",
    "while phase change phenomena described by the stefan condition appear in various kinds of science and engineering processes , their mathematical analysis remains quite challenging due to the implicitly given moving interface that reflects the time evolution of a spatial domain , so - called  free boundary problem \" @xcite .",
    "physically , the classical one - phase stefan problem describes the temperature profile along a liquid - solid material , where the dynamics of the liquid - solid interface is influenced by the heat flux induced by melting or solidification phenomena .",
    "mathematically , the problem involves a diffusion partial differential equation ( pde ) coupled with an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) . here",
    ", the pde describes the heat diffusion that provokes melting or solidification of a given material and the ode delineates the time - evolution of the moving front at the solid - liquid interface .",
    "while the numerical analysis of the one - phase stefan problem is broadly covered in the literature , their control related problems have been addressed relatively fewer .",
    "in addition to it , most of the proposed control approaches are based on finite dimensional approximations with the assumption of an explicitly given moving boundary dynamics @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "diffusion - reaction processes with an explicitly known moving boundary dynamics are investigated in @xcite based on the concept of inertial manifold @xcite and the partitioning of the infinite dimensional dynamics into slow and fast finite dimensional modes .",
    "motion planning boundary control has been adopted in @xcite to ensure asymptotic stability of a one - dimensional one - phase nonlinear stefan problem assuming a prior known moving boundary and deriving the manipulated input from the solutions of the inverse problem .",
    "however , the series representation introduced in @xcite leads to highly complex solutions that reduce controller design possibilities .    for control objectives ,",
    "infinite - dimensional frameworks that lead to significant challenges in the process characterization have been developed for the stabilization of the temperature profile and the moving interface of the stefan problem .",
    "an enthalpy - based boundary feedback control law that ensures asymptotical stability of the temperature profile and the moving boundary at a desired reference , has been employed in @xcite .",
    "lyapunov analysis is performed in @xcite based on a geometric control approach which enables to adjust the position of a liquid - solid interface at a desired setpoint while exponentially stabilizing the @xmath1-norm of the distributed temperature .",
    "however , the results in @xcite are stated based on physical assumptions on the liquid temperature being greater than melting point , which needs to be guaranteed by showing strictly positive boundary input .",
    "backstepping controller design employs an invertible transformation that maps an original system into a stable target system . during the past few decades",
    ", such a controller design technique has been intensely exploited for the boundary control of diffusion pdes defined on a fixed spatial domain as firstly introduced in @xcite for the control of a heat equation via measurement of domain - average temperature . for a class of one - dimensional linear parabolic partial integro - differential equations ,",
    "a state - estimator called backstepping observer was introduced in @xcite , which can be combined to the earlier state - feedback boundary controller designed for an identical system @xcite to systematically construct output feedback regulators . over the same period ,",
    "advection - reaction - diffusion systems with space - dependent thermal conductivity or time - dependent reactivity coefficient were studied in @xcite , and parabolic pdes containing unknown destabilizing parameters affecting the interior of the domain or unknown boundary parameters were adaptively controlled in @xcite combining the backstepping control technique with passive or swapping identifiers .",
    "further advances on the backstepping control of diffusion equations defined on a multidimensional space or involving in - domain coupled systems can be found in @xcite .",
    "results devoted to the backstepping stabilization of coupled systems described by a diffusion pde in cascade with a linear ode has been primarily presented in @xcite with dirichlet type of boundary interconnection and extended to neuman boundary interconnection in @xcite . for systems relevant with stefan problem",
    ", @xcite designed a backstepping output feedback controller that ensures the exponential stability of an unstable parabolic pde on _ a priori _ known dynamics of moving interface which is assumed to be an analytic function in time .",
    "moreover , for pde - ode cascaded systems under a state - dependent moving boundary , @xcite developed a local stabilization of nonlinear odes with actuator dynamics modeled by wave pde under time- and state - dependent moving boundary .",
    "such a technique is based on the input delay and wave compensation for nonlinear odes designed in @xcite and its extension to state - dependent input delay compensation for nonlinear odes provided by @xcite .",
    "however , the results in @xcite and @xcite that cover state - dependence problems do not ensure global stabilization due to a so - called feasibility condition that needs to be satisfied _",

    "this paper combines the results of our conference papers @xcite and @xcite and extends them by providing the robustness analysis of the closed - loop system with the state feedback control to the plant parameters mismatch and the corresponding results under dirichlet boundary control .",
    "first , a state feedback control law that requires the measurement of the liquid phase temperature profile and the moving interface position is constructed using a novel nonlinear backstepping transformation .",
    "the proposed state feedback controller achieves exponential stabilization of the temperature profile and the moving interface to the desired references in @xmath0-norm under the least restrictive condition on the setpoint imposed by energy conservation law .",
    "robustness of the state feedback controller to thermal diffusivity and latent heat of fusion mismatch is also characterized by explicitly given bounds of the uncertainties magnitude .",
    "second , an exponentially state observer which reconstruct the entire distributed temperature profile based solely on the measurement of only the interface position , namely , the length of the melting zone is constructed using the novel backstepping transformation . finally , combining the state feedback law with the state estimator , the exponential stabilization of the estimation error , the temperature profile , and the moving interface to the desired references in the @xmath2-norm under some explicitly given restrictions on the observer gain and the setpoint .",
