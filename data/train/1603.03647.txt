    "singer dirac operator @xmath13 on @xmath14 , acting on sections of a given spin bundle @xmath15 over @xmath10 .",
    "the perturbations @xmath16 we consider arise from the pullback of the atiyah ",
    "singer operator on a nearby manifold @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , we have a diffeomorphism @xmath18 which induce a map @xmath19 between the two spinor bundles , and we set @xmath20 on @xmath14 . for the construction of the induced spinor pullback , we follow @xcite by bourguignon and build this from the isometric factor of the polar factorisation of the differential of @xmath21 .    the perturbation is for the symbol @xmath22 in the functional calculi of the operators @xmath5 and @xmath16 .",
    "this will yield continuity results in the riesz metric given by for unbounded self - adjoint operators .",
    "our method of proof though , applies equally well to any other symbol @xmath23 which is holomorphic and bounded on the neighbourhood @xmath24 of @xmath25 for some @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "our riesz continuity result is non - trivial since the different limits of the symbol , @xmath28 , will entail a cutting through the spectrum at infinity .",
    "this should be compared to the weaker continuity result for the graph metric @xmath29 for unbounded self - adjoint operators , which is simpler since the symbol @xmath30 is holomorphic at @xmath31 .",
    "further details of the relation between different metrics on unbounded self - adjoint operators in general , and a motivating theory of spectral flow , can be found in @xcite by lesch .",
    "of particular relevance to the present paper is proposition 2.2 in @xcite , where the general relations between different metrics on the space of unbounded self - adjoint operators is proved .",
    "in particular , it is proved that @xmath32 holds for small perturbations of self - adjoint operators with domain @xmath7 .",
    "we achieve a non - trivial strengthening of this estimate for dirac type differential operators , using techniques from harmonic analysis . the structure of the perturbation that we consider is @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are bounded multiplication operators @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "typically in applications , and in particular for the atiyah - singer dirac operator , one can achieve @xmath40 where @xmath3 is the metric on @xmath14 and @xmath41 is the metric on @xmath42 pulled back to @xmath14 . in order to conclude small riesz distance between @xmath43 and @xmath16 using ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.2 ) , one would need not only smallness of @xmath44 but also smallness of the lipschitz norm of @xmath35 .",
    "this we do not assume , only the finiteness of @xmath45 .    in our main result , theorem [ thm : main ]",
    ", we prove the perturbation estimate @xmath46 where the implicit constant depends on the geometry of @xmath47 and the operators @xmath43 and @xmath16 as described in the hypothesis [ hyp : first]-[hyp : last ] preceding theorem [ thm : main ] . in our application ,",
    "theorem [ thm : mainapp ] , to the atiyah - singer dirac operator as previously discussed , the implicit constant depends roughly on the @xmath48 norm of @xmath49 and @xmath50 norm of @xmath3 .",
    "injectivity radius bounds coupled with bounds on ricci curvature and its first derivatives allow us to obtain uniformly sized balls corresponding to harmonic coordinates at every point .",
    "moreover , we obtain uniform @xmath50 control of the metric @xmath3 in each such chart . therefore our result , unlike proposition 2.2 in @xcite , will apply to metric perturbations with @xmath51 small only in @xmath2 norm , under uniform control of @xmath52 and @xmath53 like @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the main work in establishing is to prove quadratic estimates of the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a bounded operator , a multiplication operator , or special kind of a singular integral .",
    "the use of such quadratic estimates to bound functional calculi goes back to the work of coifman , mcintosh and meyer @xcite on caldern s problem on the boundedness of the cauchy integral of lipschitz curves .",
    "the quadratic estimates that we require in this paper are at the level of those needed to bound caldern s first commutator .",
    "an additional technical difficulty for us in the present work is that @xmath57 also may involve a certain singular integral operator . to overcome this problem",
    ", we need a riesz - weitzenbck condition stated as hypothesis [ hyp : weitz ] .",
    "the starting point for our work in this paper , was a twin result for the hodge  dirac operator @xmath58 proved by the last two named authors jointly with keith in @xcite .",
    "there it was proved , in the case of compact manifolds , that @xmath59    this made use not only of the methods from @xcite described above , but also of stopping time arguments for carleson measures from the solution of the kato square root problem by auscher , hofmann , lacey , mcintosh and tchamitchian  @xcite .",
    "these techniques give results for perturbations when the domains of the hodge - dirac operators change , that is when no lipschitz control of the metric is assumed , and even give holomorphic dependence of @xmath60 on the metric @xmath3 and not only lipschitz dependence .",
    "however , there are also reasons to prefer the softer methods used in this paper and to avoid the stopping time arguments .",
    "namely , even though they make the implicit constant in independent of any lipschitz control of the metrics , this constant in applications may become too large for the estimate to be useful .",
    "our plan is to return to the perturbation problem for the hodge - dirac operator in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "our main perturbation theorem , theorem [ thm : main ] for general dirac - type operators is formulated in ",
    "[ sec : mainpert ] . before stating it , we discuss the geometric and operator theoretic assumptions and we list quantities that the implicit constant in the estimate depends on as hypotheses [ hyp : first]-[hyp : last ] .    for the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , the reader may jump directly to  [ sec : red ] and  [ sec : sfe ] .",
    "independent of this , we first devote  [ sec : dirac ] to prove theorem [ thm : mainapp ] , which is an application of theorem [ thm : main ] to the atiyah - singer dirac operator . for the sake of concreteness",
    ", we only consider this dirac operator obtained from the complex irreducible representation of dimension @xmath61 and a given spin structure .",
    "but we expect theorem [ thm : mainapp ] to hold for more general dirac - type operators on dirac - bundles under similar geometric assumptions .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : mainapp ] amounts to verifying [ hyp : first]-[hyp : last ] and the perturbation structure .",
    "a key observation regarding the latter is the following exploited in ",
    "[ sec : struc ] . a perturbation term @xmath36 of the form @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 denoting a partial derivative ) with @xmath64 small , but with @xmath65 only bounded , can be handed as terms @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , since by the product rule , @xmath68 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] in  [ sec : red ] and  [ sec : sfe ] , brought together in  [ sec : sfeunited ] , contains the following steps . using the functional calculus of @xmath5 and @xmath16 , the estimate of @xmath69 is reduced to the quadratic estimate in proposition [ prop : firstred ] and [ prop : finalred ] .",
    "this quadratic estimate is obtained in three steps described by the formula , following a well known harmonic analysis technique used in the solution of the kato square root problem with its origins from r. coifman and y. meyer . for us ,",
    "the last term @xmath70 is not the main one , since the needed carleson measure estimate follows directly from the self - adjointness of @xmath16 , as shown in ",
    "[ sec : sfecarl ] .",
    "the main term in is rather the first , which localises the operator @xmath71 , which is local on scale @xmath72 , to the multiplication operator @xmath73 .",
    "our problem here is the presence of @xmath74 , which is essentially a singular integral operator . to handle the non - local operator @xmath75 in proposition [ prop : prinpart ] , we require some smoothness of @xmath5 , guaranteed by the riesz - weitzenbck condition . in @xcite",
    ", bunke obtains such an estimate , but with assumptions on the riemannian curvature tensor in place of the ricci curvature .",
    "our proof here is inspired by the improvements that hebey presents using harmonic coordinate charts under the presence of positive injectivity radius and bounds on ricci curvature to prove density theorems for sobolev spaces of functions on noncompact manifolds in @xcite .",
