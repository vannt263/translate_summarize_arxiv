    "over the last decades , ion trap experiments have become versatile instruments to investigate a variety of physical phenomena , ranging from quantum computing @xcite , optical clocks @xcite and precision spectroscopy @xcite to quantum simulations @xcite .",
    "many applications benefit from the fact that ions can be easily stored @xcite , with trap life times spanning from hours to months , and coherently manipulated with commercially available laser systems . furthermore , + trapped ions feature very long coherence times @xcite and the possibility of cooling the external degrees of freedom to the vibrational ground state @xcite , making them an ideal test bed to investigate quantum mechanics .",
    "the strong coulomb interaction can then be used to cool simultaneously stored charged particles , opening new prospects for cooling of complex molecular ions to the rotational and vibrational ground state @xcite .    in many experiments ,",
    "ions with hyperfine structure ( e.g. @xmath2ca@xmath1@xcite , @xmath3be@xmath1@xcite , @xmath4cd@xmath1@xcite , @xmath0mg@xmath1@xcite , yb@xmath1 @xcite ) are employed . for quantum computing experiments",
    "the long - lived hyperfine ground states are usually chosen as qubit states .",
    "ground - state cooling is achieved by driving optical raman transitions between these states , which often requires several complex raman and repumping laser systems @xcite . here",
    ", we report on cooling of the @xmath0mg@xmath1 isotope to an average vibrational population of @xmath5 using a single solid - state fiber laser system with an incorporated electro - optical modulator .",
    "the principle behind the laser setup represents a major simplification over previously used mg@xmath1 laser systems @xcite . a similar approach based on acousto - optical modulators with less detuning of the raman beams",
    "has yielded a mean vibrational population of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ setup ]",
    "the experimental setup used for trapping , cooling and manipulating a single @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion in a paul trap is described . in section [ gsc_cooling ] the sequences to achieve ground - state cooling of the @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion are explained and in section [ results ] the experimental results on the cooling efficiency are discussed .",
    "the following sections contain a detailed description of our experimental setup to implement doppler and raman resolved - sideband cooling of an @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion stored in a linear paul trap .",
    "the doppler cooling transition in @xmath0mg@xmath1 is at a wavelength of 280 nm .",
    "we generate this light by frequency quadrupling a commercial fiber laser at @xmath7 nm with a specified line width of @xmath8khz and an output power of @xmath9w , similarly to the setup presented in @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : laser_setup ] , the output of the laser is frequency - doubled in a second - harmonic generation ( shg ) bow - tie cavity by an anti - reflection - coated @xmath10mm@xmath11 lithium triborate ( lbo ) crystal using @xmath12 non - critical phase - matching of type i. a typical output power of @xmath13mw at @xmath14 nm is observed after the cavity .",
    "usually @xmath15mw of the light is picked up for frequency - stabilizing the fiber laser using saturation spectroscopy in a molecular @xmath16 cell .",
    "the output of the lbo cavity is coupled into a second bow - tie cavity which contains a @xmath17mm@xmath11 brewster - cut @xmath18-barium - borate ( bbo ) crystal for shg using critical phase - matching of type i. here , a typical output power of @xmath19mw at @xmath20 nm is observed .",
    "the length of each cavity is stabilized by the standard hnsch - couillaud locking technique @xcite .",
    "the novelty in this setup consists of an electro - optical modulator ( eom ) that is located between the two doubling cavities to imprint sidebands at @xmath21ghz onto the green laser beam .",
    "the fiber laser is frequency - tuned such that one of the sidebands coincides with the @xmath22s@xmath23 to @xmath22p@xmath24 transition of @xmath25 , which is used for doppler cooling .",
    "the optical carrier , detuned by @xmath21ghz when sidebands are switched off , is employed for driving raman transitions between two hyperfine states , as shown in figure [ fig : mg25_level_scheme ] and described in section [ setup : coherent_manipulation ] .",
    "this setup allows for fast switching between the resonant doppler cooling and the off - resonant raman configuration on a timescale faster than @xmath26s while using just a single laser system .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the frequency doubling process affects the modulation index , but does not change the carrier - sideband frequency separation @xcite . the eom phase - modulates the electric field with frequency @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath18 is the modulation index and @xmath29ghz in our case .",
    "frequency doubling then doubles the modulation index , since @xmath30 the transmission of both @xmath31 sidebands through the bbo cavity is guaranteed by adjusting its free spectral range accordingly .",
    "we typically drive the eom with @xmath32w of radio - frequency power to achieve a measured carrier to single - sideband ratio of @xmath33 before frequency doubling , which corresponds to a modulation index of @xmath34 .",
    "after frequency doubling , we measure @xmath35 of the total power in each of the sidebands as expected for twice the modulation index .",
    "it should be noted that driving the eom with more than @xmath36w results in significant beam deflection when turning the eom on .",
    "this is probably caused by thermal effects in the eom crystal .",
    "for the raman configuration the laser beam is split into two branches .",
    "each branch passes through an individual single - pass aom which is resonantly driven at @xmath37mhz .",
    "after that , the beams counter - propagate through the same aom double - pass configuration ( see figure [ fig : aom_setup ] ) consisting of two aoms , driven at @xmath38mhz , providing two raman laser beams ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) with a frequency difference of @xmath41ghz .",
    "typically , we achieve an efficiency of @xmath42% for the single - pass aoms and @xmath43% for the double - pass aoms for each branch .",
    "this configuration , in contrast to otherwise used double - pass setups @xcite , has been chosen for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the most common way to realize a double - pass aom is by turning the linear polarization after the first pass of the aom by @xmath12 and then separating the overlapped retro - reflected beam from the incoming beam with a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "this is not possible in the ultra - violet ( uv ) since the diffraction efficiency of the uv grade fused silica crystal of the aom strongly depends on the polarization . in a second approach ,",
    "the beams are geometrically separated .",
    "this is usually done by a combination of a lens and a cat s eye which can for example be realized by two reflecting mirrors or a single right - angle prism .",
    "using both these configurations in our setup , we have observed a degradation of the laser beam shape along with a significant decrease of the overall light transmission efficiency over a timescale of a few hours .",
    "we attribute this effect to uv - induced damage on the optical cathetus facet of the prism and on the mirror surfaces , respectively .",
    "since a degradation was only observed on the first reflecting surfaces that were hit by the laser beam , we assume that the light intensity has to overcome a certain threshold to produce this effect @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "typically a @xmath44mw laser beam was focused to a waist of @xmath45 m at the prism or mirror , resulting in an intensity of @xmath46kw / m@xmath22 . in order to circumvent this effect ,",
    "we re - designed the double - pass aom configuration , according to figure [ fig : aom_setup ] , avoiding a focus near any of the optical surfaces .",
    "the aom setup provides the laser beams for off - resonant raman excitation if the eom is switched off . at the same time , the @xmath39-raman beam can be used to resonantly repump the population from the upper hyperfine manifold of the ground state ( f@xmath47 ) by switching on the eom .",
    "this demonstrates the simplicity of this setup , since otherwise a second laser system providing an individual resonant repumping beam is necessary .",
    "our experimental sequences require pulsed operation , hence all laser beams are intensity stabilized by means of a sample - and - hold proportional - integral controller . a field - programmable gate array ( fpga ) based pulse sequencer , which allows for frequency and phase - switching of six direct digital synthesis ( dds ) output channels at a sub-@xmath26s rate @xcite ,",
    "is used to provide frequency sources for all aoms . every time - critical component in the setup",
    "is referenced during all the measurements discussed here to a @xmath48mhz frequency standard .",
    "we produce @xmath0mg@xmath1 ions using photoionization of a thermal beam of magnesium atoms provided by resistive heating of a stainless - steel tube oven .",
    "a single light source at @xmath49 nm with a power of @xmath50 @xmath26w from a frequency - quadrupled diode laser is used for this process .",
    "the diode laser has an output power of @xmath51mw and operates at a wavelength of @xmath52 nm .",
    "its output is frequency - quadrupled by means of two cascaded shg cavities , similarly to the main laser setup @xmath53 mgo doped crystal ( hg photonics ) and a bbo crystal ( castech crystals inc . ) for shg .",
    "both cavities are stabilized using the pound - drever hall locking technique @xcite . ] .",
    "the atoms are ionized in a two - step process , involving the @xmath54 state in neutral magnesium @xcite .",
    "although the natural abundance of the @xmath0 mg isotope is only @xmath55% , it turns out to be sufficient for satisfactory loading rates of the desired isotope .",
    "the setup allows for isotope - selective loading by tuning the frequencies of the ionization and doppler cooling lasers according to the isotope shifts .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath0 mg ( @xmath56 mg ) resonance is higher by @xmath57mhz ( @xmath58mhz ) compared to the @xmath59 mg resonance , respectively @xcite .",
    "after the ionization process , a single @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion is stored in a linear paul trap @xcite , as shown in figure [ fig : trap ] .",
    "axial confinement is provided by applying a dc voltage of typically @xmath60kv to the tip electrodes and radial confinement is realized by applying a radio - frequency of @xmath61w at @xmath62mhz , which is then resonantly enhanced by means of a helical resonator @xcite , yielding an amplitude on the order of a few hundreds of volts at the radial blades .",
    "these parameters result in axial and radial harmonic confinement with trapping frequencies for @xmath0mg@xmath1 of @xmath63mhz .",
    "the transitions used for cooling and coherent manipulation of the states of the ion are shown in the simplified level scheme of @xmath0mg@xmath1 in figure [ fig : mg25_level_scheme ] . during all measurements",
    "the degeneracy between the magnetic sub - levels is lifted by a magnetic field of @xmath64mt .",
    "doppler cooling of the ion is achieved by switching on the eom sidebands , providing a near - resonant coupling of one of the sidebands to the @xmath22s@xmath23 to @xmath22p@xmath24 transition , which has a natural line width of @xmath65mhz @xcite .    to perform optimal cooling",
    ", the beam is detuned by half the line width by means of acousto - optical modulators ( aom ) and its power is set to the saturation intensity of the transition ( @xmath66mw / cm@xmath22 ) .",
    "the beam s polarization is carefully adjusted such that only @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) transitions are addressed . while applying this beam , the ion is optically pumped into the @xmath70 state , ideally leading to a closed cycling transition .",
    "population in the f@xmath47 manifold is efficiently transferred to the f@xmath71 manifold by a repumping beam ( see below ) which is additionally applied during doppler cooling to further improve state initialization .    for coherent manipulation of the ion",
    ", we couple the hyperfine ground states , @xmath70 and @xmath72 , either by a raman transition which is off - resonant by @xmath21ghz to the @xmath22s@xmath23 to @xmath22p@xmath24 transition or by direct application of radio - frequency at @xmath41ghz , corresponding to the hyperfine splitting in @xmath0mg@xmath1 @xcite . for the given rabi frequencies in this work",
    ", each raman beam has typically @xmath73mw of power in a collimated beam of @xmath74 m diameter before being focused onto the ion by a lens ( f=@xmath75 mm ) . in case of the radio - frequency transitions , sufficiently strong field amplitudes at the position of the ion",
    "are achieved by applying @xmath76w of microwave power to an impedance - matched quarter - wave antenna made of a special coaxial cable with an attenuation of @xmath77db / m at @xmath78ghz .",
    "the antenna is attached to the outside of the vacuum chamber ( see figure [ fig : chamber ] ) at a distance of @xmath79 cm from the ion .",
    "the fluorescence of the ion resulting from the excitation of the resonant doppler cooling beam is collected by both an uv objective and an aluminum parabolic mirror ( see figure [ fig : chamber ] ) and imaged onto a single photon counting module ( pmt ) for quantitative readout . the fluorescence light can also be directed onto a ccd camera+ 885 emccd ] to observe a geometrical image of the ion for alignment purposes .",
    "the uv objective is an extension of an existing design @xcite covering a simulated solid angle of @xmath80% of @xmath81 , whereas the parabolic mirror covers a solid angle of @xmath82% for fluorescence collection @xcite .",
    "typically , a count rate of @xmath83khz is observed from a single @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion during doppler cooling , when the laser is red - detuned by @xmath84mhz from the @xmath22s@xmath23 to @xmath22p@xmath24 transition and set to saturation intensity .    in all measurements described below",
    ", the ion is first initialized in the @xmath70 state by applying the doppler cooling and repumping laser beams for @xmath85 ms and then coherently manipulated according to the specific experimental sequence of laser pulses .",
    "after that , state detection is achieved via electron - shelving by applying the resonant doppler cooling beam for typically @xmath86 @xmath26s and counting the number of detected photons .",
    "in contrast to electron - shelving schemes in other ion species @xcite , the detection pulse is strongly restricted in length since the ion can be off - resonantly depumped from the @xmath72 state , thus imitating a bright ion which was initially dark .",
    "given this limitation , we typically detect a mean number of @xmath87 photons for a bright ion , whereas we observe a mean number of @xmath88 photons if the ion was dark .",
    "the actual state amplitude @xmath89 of the ion is determined by repeating the experiment @xmath90 times and fitting the resulting photon number distribution to previously calibrated , independent model distributions @xmath91 , as shown in figure [ fig : psi_dark_and_bright ] .",
    "the distribution @xmath92 for a dark ion is recorded by switching off the eom sidebands during the detection process , thus only accounting for stray light on the pmt , whereas the distribution @xmath93 for a bright ion is taken while the ion is doppler - cooled and prepared in the @xmath70 . due to the rather low number of detected photons , both distributions",
    "are not orthogonal , resulting in an overlap integral of @xmath94% , which limits the single - shot readout fidelity .      as an initial measurement ,",
    "we observe rabi oscillations between two hyperfine ground states of @xmath0mg@xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : rf_rabi_flops ] the probability of finding the doppler - cooled ion in the @xmath72 state after subjecting it to a radio - frequency pulse at @xmath41ghz is shown as a function of the pulse duration . applying the calibrated state detection procedure , we observe the expected sinusoidal state evolution with a rabi frequency of @xmath95khz and a contrast of @xmath96% .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the motion of the ion can be neglected in this measurement , since the lamb - dicke criterion is fulfilled for the radio - frequency transition @xcite .",
    "after doppler cooling , the @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion reaches a thermal state with a predicted temperature of @xmath97mk @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a mean vibrational population number of the harmonic trapping potential @xmath98 , at a trapping frequency of @xmath99mhz .",
    "the predicted population distribution for these parameters is depicted in figure [ fig : rabi_freq ] .",
    "we further cool a single ion in axial direction via raman sideband cooling @xcite by applying first and second order red sideband ( 1st /2nd rsb ) pulses which couple the internal ( electronic ) with the external ( vibrational ) degrees of freedom .",
    "this is accomplished by detuning both raman beams by one or two trapping frequencies and adjusting the pulse duration for each target state according to the calculated rabi frequencies in figure [ fig : rabi_freq ] @xcite .",
    "reinitialization and dissipation are achieved by applying a resonant repump laser pulse using the @xmath39-polarized raman beam with the eom switched on . from the excited state",
    ", the ion can decay into the target state ( @xmath100 ) , but also into the @xmath101 state .",
    "this population is recovered by applying a radio - frequency @xmath40-pulse between the @xmath101 and @xmath102 states ( rf@xmath103 ) , followed by another optical repump pulse .",
    "repeating this sequence several times reinitializes the atomic population into the @xmath70 state @xcite .",
    "each rsb pulse - repump sequence removes approximately one quantum of motion from the ion in the trap , until the ground state is achieved .",
    "the complete sideband cooling sequence begins with a series of @xmath104 2nd rsb pulses , starting from @xmath105 , which are followed by @xmath106 1st rsb pulses , starting from @xmath107 , to cool the ion to the ground state .",
    "each set of pulses is usually repeated @xmath108 times to improve the cooling process .",
    "the use of the 2nd rsb in this procedure is necessary , since ion population in @xmath109-levels beyond the zero crossing of the rabi frequency of the 1st rsb can not be efficiently transferred below this point using only the 1st rsb .",
    "the total sideband cooling sequence typically takes @xmath110 ms .",
    "figure [ fig : gsc_sidebands ] shows the measured excitation on both rsb and bsb resonances for a doppler - cooled and an axially sideband - cooled single @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion , respectively . as the ground state is expected to be a dark state for the red sidebands , the 1st rsb shows no excitation after sideband cooling , whereas the 1st bsb excitation rises almost to unity .",
    "the ratio @xmath111 of the rsb ( @xmath112 ) and bsb ( @xmath113 ) excitations gives the average axial vibrational population @xmath114",
    "@xcite @xmath115 as well as the population in the axial ground state @xmath116 .",
    "the analysis of the observed resonances , along with rabi oscillations on the sidebands , yields @xmath117 as an upper limit for the mean occupation .",
    "this corresponds to a ground state population of @xmath118 .",
    "the fact that the ion is predominantly in a single state after sideband cooling also manifests itself in a significant difference in the observed rabi oscillations on the raman carrier transitions . although carrier transitions do not change the motional quantum number , their rabi frequency depends on the motional quantum number , as shown in figure [ fig : rabi_freq ] . in case",
    "the ion is doppler - cooled , an average over many oscillations with different rabi frequencies is given , whereas if the ion occupies a fock state , an oscillation with a single frequency is expected .",
    "this behavior can be observed in the raman - stimulated rabi oscillations on the carrier transition , as depicted in figure [ fig : gsc_carr_flops ] .",
    "we attribute the decay of the oscillation for the sideband - cooled ion to several effects : dephasing due to residual @xmath119 population , magnetic field and intensity fluctuations and loss of coherence due to off - resonant excitation from the raman beams .",
    "this last effect has been measured to increase ( decrease ) the ion excitation by @xmath120s ( @xmath121s ) for an ion in the @xmath70 ( @xmath72 ) state to first order .",
    "taking this into account , the analysis of the ground state population yields @xmath122 .",
    "it should be noted that off - resonant excitation could be significantly reduced by operating the system at an optical carrier detuning of @xmath123ghz and using the 2nd order eom sidebands for cooling or by employing an eom with a higher resonance frequency .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated ground - state cooling of a single trapped @xmath0mg@xmath1 ion employing a frequency - quadrupled commercial fiber laser system .",
    "an eom in the laser system allows for fast switching between a resonant cooling / repumping configuration and an off - resonant raman laser configuration , respectively .",
    "this is a cost - effective simplification to other solid - state laser setups for mg@xmath1 ions @xcite .",
    "the performance of the laser system was demonstrated in a pulsed ground - state cooling experiment with results comparable to the best achieved with more complex laser systems .",
    "a further simplification of the optical setup is possible if internal state detection is not necessary and only ground state cooling is required . in this case",
    ", rsb pulses can be applied between two zeeman components of the ground state of an ion without hyperfine structure , such as @xmath59mg@xmath1 , eliminating the need to bridge the hyperfine structure with aoms .",
    "the demonstrated system can be used for a large variety of experiments involving ground - state cooling and coherent manipulation of ions .",
