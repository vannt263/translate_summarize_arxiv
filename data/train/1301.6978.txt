    "the cms ( compact muon solenoid ) is one of the two general - purpose detectors located at the lhc ( large hadron collider ) .",
    "the main part of the detector is a superconducting solenoid providing axial magnetic field of @xmath1 t inside the coil and @xmath2 t in the return yoke .",
    "the silicon tracker system , the crystal electromagnetic calorimeter , and the sampling brass / scintillator hadronic calorimeter are enclosed within the coil .",
    "the muon system is deployed outside of the solenoid and is situated between the layers of the steel return yoke .",
    "three different technologies have been used to trigger and measure muons : drift tubes ( dt ) ( pseudo - rapidity @xmath3 ) ; cathode strip chambers ( csc ) ( @xmath4 ) and resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the muon system consists of four stations in the barrel and in the endcaps . in the barrel part ,",
    "each station consists of 12 dt layers packed on both sides by two rpc in the first and the second stations and one rpc in the third .",
    "the outermost dt station has eight layers and one rpc . in the endcaps ,",
    "each muon station consists of six csc detection planes complemented by the rpc in the three inner stations .",
    "a detailed description of the cms detector can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the rpc system consists of 480 barrel chambers and 432 end - cap chambers and covers an active area of @xmath6 m@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this makes the rpc system the largest sub - detector at cms .",
    "the ability to work at a high rate of ionizing particles up to @xmath8 khz / cm@xmath7 has been ensured by bakelite double - gap rpcs operating in avalanche mode .",
    "a double - gap encompasses two single gaps mounted one on the top of each other with common readout strips situated in between them .",
    "the rate limitations are due to the time needed to re - establish the electric field after an avalanche in a gas gap .",
    "the voltage drop is proportional to the average avalanche charge in the gas gap and the electrode resistivity .",
    "the analytical description of the rate effects in rpc is based on simple dc model ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the advantages of the double gap design are clear within the model , i.e. doubling the induced signal while keeping the charge released per gap at the same level than in a single gap .",
    "the electrodes are made out of a bakelite which has lower resistivity than glass and the bakelite resistivity is controlled by adding water vapours to the gas mixture @xcite .",
    "each chamber consists of two or three adjacent double - gaps ( figure [ fig : doublegap ] ) held together by aluminium profiles .",
    "there are 1020 double - gaps in the barrel and 1296 in the end - caps .",
    "each double - gap has up to 96 read - out strips .",
    "there are more than @xmath10 read - out channels in total for the whole rpc subsystem .",
    "the chambers in the barrel have rectangular geometry and the width of the strips varies from @xmath11 cm for the innermost muon station to @xmath12 cm for the outermost muon station .",
    "chambers in the end - caps have trapezoidal geometry and the width of the strips varies from @xmath13 cm at the lowest radii to roughly @xmath14 cm at the highest radii .",
    "the rpcs have been used as dedicated muon trigger detectors . due to the time resolution of",
    "about @xmath2 ns , proper association between the rpc trigger information and the lhc bunch crossing has been ensured @xcite .",
    "cms experiment should be able to distinguish the detector related effects from the real physical processes .",
    "the cms experiment studies different physical processes , detecting the particles originating from proton - proton or lead - lead collisions .",
    "a crucial part of the data analysis is the successful factorization of the detector related effects from the real physical processes , resulting in the collisions .",
    "for example one needs to know very well the geometrical acceptance and efficiency of the detector and the trigger system in order to calculate the cross section for a given physical process .",
    "the cms detector performance has been very well studied in details and has been implemented in the cms simulation , thus simulation has been used to account for detector related effects , during data analysis .",
    "a dedicated monte carlo simulation of the cms detector is a crucial part of the data analysis and the simulation result enters in the final physical result of the cms collaboration .",
    "the correct simulation of the detector response is used also for the study of the upgrade of the cms rpc system . in the past decades",
    "several rpc simulation techniques are proposed by different authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of them are focused on the simulation of the rpc properties , , ab initio  , i.e. obtaining detector characteristics ( charge spectra , efficiency , timing , etc . ) from detector parameters ( e.g. townsend coefficient , gas gap width , number of gaps , etc . ) .",
    "these techniques are very important and useful for detector r&d .",
    "they can be used to simulate different rpc types and to optimize detector design in terms of gap width , gas composition , strip parameters .",
    "even an approach for modeling of the rpc behavior , based on artificial neural networks is developed @xcite .",
    "the method predicts the behavior of the anode charge as a function of the environmental temperature and pressure .",
    "all of these techniques are good for describing the parameters of a given rpc type .",
    "our task is to simulate 2316 individual detectors , all together with the detector electronics .",
    "all of these detectors are of one type in terms of townsend coefficients , efficiency and front - end electronics .",
    "the detectors are working for almost a decade and the important detector parameters have been measured and well understood . to take advantage of our knowledge",
    "we adopted data driven parametrized simulation model .",
    "collision data and cosmic data collected in 2011 have been used for estimation of the rpc efficiency and noise simulation parameters . the time resolution and cluster size distribution",
    "have been estimated from experimental data collected on cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the following parameters , taken from a dedicated database have been used in the default digitization algorithm :    * efficiency for each readout strip ; * cluster size distributions ; * detector time resolution . * noise rate for each readout strip ;    in order to tune the mc simulation to the experimental data it is very important to update regularly the parameters used for the rpc response simulation .",
    "presently , three sets of parameter values with different efficiency and noise rate parameters are used :    * default values : rpc efficiency @xmath15% ; strip noise @xmath16 hz / cm@xmath7 ; time resolution @xmath17 ns ; cluster size distribution estimated from experimental data collected by cosmic ray telescope @xcite ; * parameters estimated using cosmic - ray data ; * parameters estimated from proton - proton collisions data .",
    "cmssw is a dedicated software framework for cms event reconstruction , monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and data analysis .",
    "simulation of the rpc response is an integral part of the entire cmssw simulation chain which is used for the physical cms analysis .",
    "the simulation chain in cmssw has been organized as follows :    * event generation  events have been generated by physics events generators , interfaced by cmssw . in the particular case",
    "pythia event generator @xcite has been used in order to generate drell  yan events with two muons in the final state @xcite ; * event simulation  cmssw interface to geant4@xcite has been used to simulate the passage of particles through the detector .",
    "the whole cms detector has been described precisely in the simulation , taking into account the mechanical design , material budget and magnetic field .",
    "the rpcs have been described by their components i.e. aluminium housing , bakelite plates , active gas volume , filled with the , , standard  gas mixture @xcite and readout strips . in the particular case of rpc simulation , the result of the simulation step is a simulated hit in the active detector volume ; * digitization  in response to each simulated hit , one or few adjacent strips have been fired with a given probability . timing information has been used to assign the detector response to a given bunch crossing .",
    "the intrinsic detector noise has been simulated on the same step ; * trigger  level 1(l1 ) trigger has been emulated and high level trigger(hlt ) algorithms have been executed on this step ; * event reconstruction ",
    "the reconstruction algorithms have been performed .",
    "* efficiency  the rpc efficiency has been estimated employing the segment extrapolation method@xcite .",
    "dt / csc reconstructed track segments have been extrapolated to the rpc strip planes and used to look for rpc hits in the surroundings of the extrapolated point .",
    "efficiency has been computed as the ratio between the number of observed rpc hits and the expected number of hits from segment extrapolation .",
    "the average chamber efficiency computed with this method has been assigned to all the strips of the same chamber .",
    "these values obtained from experimental data have been used for the rpc efficiency parametrization . during the simulation , the decision whether the strip should be fired or not has been taken according to the assigned strip efficiency . *",
    "cluster size  the number of simultaneously fired adjacent strips ( cluster size ) has been calculated using an empirical cluster size distribution for each chamber .",
    "the rpc intrinsic efficiency and cluster size are assumed to be independent from the muon momentum in our simulation model . for our studies only high momenta muons ( above few tens of gev )",
    "have been taken into account . in a good approximation",
    "they behave as minimum ionization particles in our detectors @xcite . for even higher momenta muons ( in tev range )",
    "the radiative effects are treated on the simulation step by geant .",
    "according to the experimental data @xcite , the clusters size has very weak dependence from the muon impact angle for angles smaller then 45@xmath18 and thus that dependence is not implemented in the simulation .",
    "however , detailed analysis of the experimental data shows that the cluster size depends on the muon impact point on the strip .",
    "the dependence is parametrized in the simulations and the parameters are obtained from the experimental data .",
    "the strip has been formally subdivided in five slices along its width , and the impact point of the muon has been used to find the fired slice coordinates . for each slice",
    "we have a different cluster size distribution and the random number , corresponding to the cluster size , is generated from the distribution .",
    "all the distributions have been obtained from the experimental data , using an algorithm explained in @xcite .",
    "an example of such a distribution is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] .",
    "* timing  the read - out of the cms detector is performed every @xmath19 ns .",
    "the true signals correspond to the signals within a @xmath19 time window , synchronized with the lhc bunch crossing separation , so called central bunch crossing .",
    "the information from six consecutive time windows , two before and three after the central bunch crossing , has been collected to form an event . for proper bunch crossing assignment the time of flight of the particle , the signal propagation speed on the strip and the delay of the signal along the cables for each chamber have been taken into account .",
    "the time of flight depends on the momentum of the muon and has been calculated for each simulated particle .",
    "the signal propagation time along the strip depends on the hit position on the strip .",
    "it has been simulated assuming the signal propagation speed equals to @xmath20% of the speed of light .",
    "the value assumed for the signal propagation speed is consistent with the average shift of the signal arrival time observed in data samples taken at different positions along the read - out strips for a set of chambers @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the signal propagation speed is not an issue in the simulation , because the time is measured in bunch - crossings , i.e. time quanta is @xmath19 ns . the intrinsic time resolution of the chambers altogether with the attached front - end electronics is less than @xmath21 ns for all the chambers and the time resolution has been simulated as a gaussian with a mean value 0 ns and sigma @xmath22 ns .",
    "the different channel - to - channel delays in a chamber are far below this value . a constant time offset for every chamber",
    "is added to account for different cable lengths , muon time of flight etc .",
    "the rpc signal synchronization is described in @xcite .",
    "* noise  there are two possible types of parametrization used for intrinsic noise simulation .",
    "a parametrization where all the strips have a default value of @xmath16 hz / cm@xmath7 was used in the first half of the 2011 .",
    "a realistic noise parametrization has been used afterwards .",
    "the intrinsic rpc noise has been measured during cosmic runs @xcite and used to model the mc response .",
    "the estimation of the simulated noise rate for a given strip in a certain event has been based on the poisson distribution with mean @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the measured strip noise , @xmath26 is the strip area and the total simulated time is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of simulated bunch crossings .",
    "+ the simulated noise signals are uniformly distributed in time windows around the central bunch crossing , including the central one .",
    "the input to the digitization is efficiency , cluster size distribution , time resolution and noise rate , normalized by the area .",
    "the output of the digitization is a digi .",
    "the digi in the rpc case is a pair of two numbers .",
    "the first number correspond to the read out channel of the front - end electronics connected to the fired strip and the second number corresponds to the time when the strip is fired , measured in bunch - crossing units ( time quanta is @xmath19 ns ) .",
    "the digi is used in the cmssw framework for the consecutive level 1 trigger emulation and on the reconstruction step .",
    "it is difficult to compare digis to the input parameters and in order to validate the whole simulation and the digitization in particular a dedicated analysis has been performed . in the analysis",
    "the output of the reconstruction of the simulated events has been used to estimate efficiency from mc , cluster size distribution from mc and timing from mc .",
    "the results have been compared to the input parameters or to the real experimental date in order to estimate the goodness of the mc simulation and correctness of the mc model .      in order to validate the goodness of the simulation ,",
    "drell  yan events with two muons in the final state with invariant mass greater then @xmath29 gev / c@xmath7 have been simulated using the pythia event generator @xcite .",
    "the generated events have passed the full simulation chain .",
    "a dedicated selection procedure choosing muons from z decays has been applied both on the mc and collision data . for the purposes of validation",
    ", the efficiency of a given rpc has been estimated as the ratio between the number of events with at least one fired strip corresponding to a simulated muon hit and the total number of simulated muons crossing the chamber .",
    "the comparison between the input efficiency parameters estimated from experimental data and the simulated efficiency is shown on the figure [ fig : eff ] .",
    "the chambers working in a single mode have a lower efficiency , which is well reproduced in the mc results .",
    "noise signals in the mc are defined as all the fired strips without a corresponding simulated hit .",
    "for the purposes of validation , the average simulated noise for the chamber @xmath30 has been calculated as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of all noise signals for a given chamber in the event , @xmath33 is the chamber area , @xmath34 is the number of simulated events and @xmath35 is the total simulated time .",
    "the average simulated noise for the strip has been calculated in a similar way , but using the strip area and the number of the noise signals for a given strip .",
    "the comparison between the input noise parameters estimated from experimental data and the simulated noise is shown on the figure [ fig : noi ] .",
    "the time resolution , used in the simulation is @xmath36 ns . thus the timing is always correct , because it is measured in bunch crossing , where one bunch crossing is @xmath19 ns .",
    "the comparison between cluster size distributions used as simulation input parameters and the mc results is presented on fig . [",
    "fig : cls ] ( right ) together with overall cluster size distribution ( left ) .",
    "the cluster size depends on track impact position , relative to the strip edge . in our parametrization",
    "the strip is divided into 5 slices , i.e. the slice corresponds to the muon impact point .",
    "rpcs have been mainly used as dedicated trigger detectors , however , they contribute to the muon reconstruction as well @xcite",
    ". the main goal of the simulation is to reproduce correctly the response of the rpc system , including efficiency , acceptance , misalignment , geometry , etc . to validate the correctness of the overall rpc simulation ,",
    "the mc simulation has been compared to the real experimental data .",
