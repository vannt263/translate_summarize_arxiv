    "gravitational - wave interferometers of the type used in the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite are typically variants of a michelson interferometer with fabry - prot cavities in the arms .",
    "in addition to the arm cavities , the optical configuration for interferometers may include a partially reflecting mirror between the laser source and the input port of the beamsplitter  a technique known as power - recycling , and/or a partially transmitting mirror between the antisymmetric or output port of the beamsplitter and photodetector  a technique refered to signal tuning .",
    "the present - day interferometric gravitational - wave detectors are limited by shot noise at high frequencies ( @xmath0  hz ) ; in the next generation of detectors , as other noise sources are suppressed and the input laser power is increased , the sensitivity of the detectors is expected to be limited by quantum optical noise due to fluctuations of the vacuum fields at almost all frequencies .",
    "two sources contribute to the limiting optical noise : _ shot noise _ , which arises from uncertainty due to quantum mechanical fluctuations in the number of photons at the interferometer output ; and _ radiation - pressure noise _ , which arises from mirror displacement induced by radiation - pressure fluctuations .",
    "both sources can be attributed to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic fields that enter the open ports of the interferometer @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are associated with orthogonal quadratures of the vacuum : shot noise comes from the phase quadrature and radiation - pressure noise comes from the amplitude quadrature of the input vacuum field .",
    "the spectrum of shot noise is independent of frequency , while that of radiation - pressure noise falls off with increasing frequency , which causes the two noise sources to dominate in different frequency bands .",
    "an exact balancing of the shot noise and radiation - pressure noise , in the absence of correlations between them , leads to the standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "injection of squeezed light ( vacuum ) into the unused output port of an interferometer was initially proposed as a means of reducing the shot noise , assuming limited laser power @xcite , but the fixed squeeze angle proposed did not breach the sql .",
    "the _ squeeze angle _ describes the linear combination of input quadratures in which the fluctuations are reduced ; it governs the relative distribution of quantum noise in each quadrature  and hence the quantum noise at all frequencies .",
    "subsequently it was realized that injection of squeezed vacuum with the proper squeeze angle would beat the sql over a narrow bandwidth @xcite .",
    "since the radiation - pressure noise dominates at low frequencies and shot noise at higher frequencies , squeezing with a single squeeze angle leads to improvement at some frequencies , but degrades the performance at other frequencies . to achieve broadband noise reduction using squeezed light ,",
    "it is necessary to produce squeezing with a frequency - dependent squeeze angle .",
    "kimble et al .",
    "@xcite recognized that squeezed vacuum reflected from appropriately detuned filter cavities could match the required squeeze angle over a broad range of frequencies and give broadband performance below the sql . squeezing in signal - tuned interferometers",
    "was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "frequency - dependent squeezing using optical cavities offers excellent performance , but it is likely to be difficult and costly to implement because it requires long ( kilometer scale ) filter cavities to reduce losses so that the squeezing is not destroyed in the process  @xcite .    here we propose using an alternative type of filter cavity that , instead of giving a frequency - dependent squeeze angle , act as high - pass filters for the squeeze amplitude . in using this design ,",
    "we reduce the harmful effects of squeezing with a constant squeeze angle and the need for a low - loss cavity , while retaining the benefits of squeezing at high frequencies .",
    "the premise of our filter is that at high frequencies the input beam will be entirely reflected by the filter cavity and the squeezing will be preserved , while at low frequencies , it will be entirely transmitted and the cavity losses will cause ordinary vacuum to replace the ( anti- ) squeezed vacuum noise .",
    "the cavities have a visibility of nearly unity . in general , we attempt to choose a transition frequency above which the squeezing is preserved and below which we destroy the anti - squeezing . for any realistic cavity ,",
    "however , there will be a transition region in which the squeezing is also partially destroyed .",
    "the use of multiple cavities allows manipulation , and hence optimization , of this transition region .    in this paper",
    "we evaluate the performance of these filter cavities and propose configurations that reduce the extent of the transition region .",
    "we initially consider the use of a single filter cavity , [ fig .",

    "cavity amplitude reflection and transmission coefficients are then given by    @xmath14    to make the cavity act as a high - pass filter for the reflected light at frequency @xmath15 ( relative to the carrier frequency , @xmath9 ) , a cavity with no reflected light at @xmath16 is desired , so we require that @xmath17 .",

    "the introduction of signal recycling has the effect of mixing the quadratures in the input / output relations of the interferometer .",
    "this allows the shot noise and radiation - pressure noise to become correlated , typically producing two resonances  @xcite : the lower frequency dip is due to an optical - mechanical coupling and the higher frequency one is a purely optical resonance due to the storage time of the gravitational wave signal in the interferometer .",

    "furthermore , we discuss the narrowband signal - recycled interferometer in term of real frequency , in hz , since the normalization to an arm cavity inverse storage time is not meaningful when the gravtitational - wave signal storage time depends on both the arm cavity and the ( detuned ) signal extraction cavity .",

    "<S> we derive the parameters for the filters , and analyze the performance of several possible cavity configurations in the context of a future gravitational - wave interferometer with squeezed light ( vacuum ) injected into the output port . </S>"
