    "<S> we study the magnetic orbital effect of a doped two - leg ladder in the presence of a magnetic field component perpendicular to the ladder plane . combining both low - energy approach ( bosonization ) and numerical simulations ( density - matrix renormalization group ) on the strong coupling limit ( t - j model ) , </S>",
    "<S> a rich phase diagram is established as a function of hole doping and magnetic flux . above a critical flux , </S>",
    "<S> the spin gap is destroyed and a luttinger liquid phase is stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> above a second critical flux , a reentrance of the spin gap at high magnetic flux is found . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the phase transitions are associated with a change of sign of the orbital susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the small magnetic field regime , the spin - gapped superconducting phase is robust but immediately acquires algebraic transverse ( i.e. along rungs ) current correlations which are commensurate with the @xmath0 density correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have computed the zero - field orbital susceptibility for a large range of doping and interactions ratio @xmath1 : we found strong anomalies at low @xmath1 only in the vicinity of the commensurate fillings corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the behavior of the orbital susceptibility reveals that the nature of these insulating phases is different : while for @xmath2 a @xmath0 charge density wave is confirmed , the @xmath4 phase is shown to be a bond order wave . </S>"
