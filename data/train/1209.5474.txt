    "those showing a plateau in their light curve are known as type  iip events , while those showing a linear decline from peak magnitude are classified as iil . a third class of events , type  iib , characterized by its spectral rather than its photometric properties , develops prominent he features at late times .",

    ". as the shocked envelope expands and cools , it recombines , releasing radiation at a roughly constant rate , thus producing a plateau in the light curve ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "it follows that sne iil might be the explosions of stars with less massive h envelopes that can not support a plateau in their light curve .",
    "sn iib progenitors , then , would contain an even smaller h mass .",
