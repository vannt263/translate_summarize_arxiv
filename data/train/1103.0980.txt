    "the electronic and magnetic properties depend on the valence of the metal ion and these compounds can be insulators , metals or superconductors @xcite . within a simple model which fits for alkaline - earth as well as rare - earth dicarbides @xcite , trivalent or quadrivalent metals form metallic dicarbides , while divalent metals form insulating compounds . of particular interest are therefore metals which can realize both , the divalent as well as the trivalent state as , e.g. , eu and yb . experimental studies of these systems are however rare , what is most probably related to the fact that both euc@xmath9 as well as ybc@xmath9 very rapidly decompose in air .",
    "since 1964 several publications have reported the synthesis of euc@xmath9 , but still there is a disagreement if it crystallizes in a tetragonal @xcite or a monoclinic @xcite structure at room temperature and below .",
    "the tetragonal modification of euc@xmath9 and its solid solutions with la and gd have been investigated in ref .",
    "and it was found that at least some of the results are not consistent with the simple model mentioned above .",
    "for example , the magnetization data of euc@xmath9 reveal a ferromagnetic transition at @xmath10k with a saturation moment of @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that europium is in the divalent state and one would expect an insulating behavior , which could , however , not be confirmed by the corresponding measurements of the electrical resistivity . in a more recent work  @xcite , the ferromagnetic order with a somewhat smaller",
    "@xmath12k has been confirmed , but the measured electrical resistivity @xmath13 shows an activated characteristics within the paramagnetic phase and varies over several orders of magnitude when the sample is heated from @xmath14 to room temperature , whereas , according to ref .",
    ", @xmath13 is almost temperature independent in that temperature range . despite these very different temperature dependences of @xmath13 , both works agree at least qualitatively in the observation of a strong suppression of @xmath15 in the ferromagnetic ordered phase .",
    "the @xmath13 data of euc@xmath9 presented in ref .   strongly resemble those of the highly investigated euo , which may be viewed as one of the most suitable model systems for future spintronics devices .    in this report",
    ", we present a detailed study of the thermodynamic properties specific heat , magnetization , and linear thermal expansion as well as electrical resistivity measurements of various euc@xmath9 samples , which are prepared under slightly varying conditions .",
    "the analysis of the thermodynamic properties reveals that the magnetic ordering transition can be consistently described by assuming localized eu@xmath16 moments with spin @xmath17 that are coupled ferromagnetically . in particular , these data",
    "do not yield any indication that the magnetic ordering transition is related with a sizable change of the average valence state of the eu ions . for the electrical transport behavior",
    ", we typically find a semiconducting behavior in the paramagnetic phase and a decrease of @xmath13 in the ferromagnetically ordered phase .",
    "the @xmath13 curves measured on different samples , however , vary with respect to the absolute value and/or the activation energy .",
    "this sample dependence is very pronounced when the preparation conditions are changed , but  to a less extent  is also present for samples which are prepared under the nominally same conditions .",
    "in order to synthesize euc@xmath9 , a total amount of about 2  g of eu and graphite powders were mixed in the molar ratio of @xmath18 in a ball mill placed inside an argon - filled glove box .",
    "the small surplus of graphite was used to inhibit the formation of euo and to account for graphite losses due to a reaction with the container wall . the mixed graphite and eu powder",
    "was transferred into a purified ta ampoule , which was sealed in he atmosphere ( 800  mbar ) .",
    "then the sealed ampoule was heated in argon atmosphere to 1400@xmath19c with a heating rate of 400@xmath19c / h , kept there for 24 hours , and then cooled to room temperature with 100@xmath19c / h .",
    "it is also possible to decrease the reaction temperature to 1200@xmath19c without changing the physical properties of the synthesized samples . in this latter case",
    "the sealed ta ampoule was placed inside a quartz ampoule , which was sealed in vacuum and the quartz ampoule was heated in air .",
    "the resulting euc@xmath9 powder is black and no impurity phases were detectable by x - ray powder diffraction ( huber g670 , mo@xmath20 radiation ) . in addition",
    ", we prepared samples with different eu : c ratios of @xmath21 in order to get off - stoichiometric samples . below we will discuss samples prepared with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , which are labeled as euc@xmath9 , euc@xmath25 and euc@xmath26 . for the measurements the powder sample obtained by the procedure described above was pressed by 2000  kg to a pellet ( diameter 5 mm ) and sintered inside a ta ampoule at 500@xmath19c for 96  h ( heating rate : 100@xmath19c / h ; cooling rate : 20@xmath19c / h ) .",
    "after sintering the quality of the sample was again checked by x - ray powder diffraction . from the polycrystalline pellets",
    "we have sanded pieces to a rectangular shape of typical dimensions of about @xmath27mm@xmath28 .",
    "as already mentioned euc@xmath9 very rapidly decomposes when it is in contact with air .",
    "thus , all sample handling was carried out in a glove box with inert atmosphere ( ar , 99.999% ) .",
    "this box has been adapted to incorporate various sample rods with measuring cells for the specific heat , the thermal expansion and the electrical resistivity .",
    "after the sample was mounted to the respective platform in argon atmosphere , the surrounding tube was evacuated and , for the actual measurements , was put into a @xmath29he bath cryostat equipped with a 14 t magnet . for the measurements at low temperatures ( 0.350  k ) we used a @xmath28he evaporator system ( heliox - vl , oxford instr . ) with home - built devices for heat - capacity and thermal - expansion measurements .",
    "the heat - capacity device uses the adiabatic heat - pulse method .",
    "the thermal - expansion device is a dilatometer which works with a variable plate capacitor controlled by the sample length .",
    "the resistivity has been measured in the temperature range from 5 to 300  k in a home - built setup that provides a temperature - variable sample platform in vacuum .",
    "we used a standard 4-probe technique with current and voltage contacts made by a 2-component silver epoxy .",
    "the magnetization has been studied in a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) using a vibrating sample magnetometer in the temperature range from 2 to 300k in magnetic fields up to 14 t . to keep the sample in an ar atmosphere during the magnetization measurements it was sealed in a quartz capillary ( suprasil ) inside the glove box .",

    "the curie - weiss fit yields @xmath36k , i.e.  a ferromagnetic exchange coupling , and an effective magnetic moment @xmath37fu .",
    "the magnetization curve @xmath38 at 2.5  k has the typical characteristics of a soft ferromagnet with a very small hysteresis and a saturation moment of @xmath39fu .",

    "an important observation is that the studied sample does not show any indications of magnetic impurities . in particular",

    "t. the dashed line is the calculated magnetic heat capacity of a ferromagnet in @xmath46  t. the difference between the measured data and the calculated values in @xmath46  t shown as a solid line represents the phonon contribution ( see text ) .",
    "[ hc],width=302 ]    fig.[hc ] displays the specific heat measurements in zero field and 14  t. the zero - field data show a pronounced anomaly at @xmath47  k , which can be attributed to the ferromagnetic ordering transition and around 4  k a broad maximum is seen in @xmath48 that resembles a schottky anomaly . both features",
    "are drastically broadened in the 14  t curve as it is expected for a ferromagnet in a large magnetic field . for a quantitative analysis one",
    "has to separate the phononic and magnetic contributions to the total specific heat , @xmath49 .",
    "because we are interested in @xmath50 we need an estimate of @xmath51 that covers the entire temperature range up to 60  k. for this estimate we calculate the magnon contribution @xmath52 for our largest magnetic field of @xmath53 within a mean - field approximation and subtract it from the experimental data . as the phonon contribution",
    "can be expected to be independent on the magnetic field , this difference represents @xmath51 for all applied fields .",
    "the calculated @xmath54 is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ hc ] and the solid line displays the obtained @xmath55 , which coincides with the measured zero - field data above @xmath56  k. this appears reasonable , because the zero - field @xmath57 is expected to rapidly fall off above @xmath58 . in principle , one could estimate @xmath51 by subtracting a zero - field calculation of @xmath57 from the respective measured data .",
    "the mean - field approximation neglects , however , the fluctuations around @xmath58 and the gapless spinwave excitations at low temperatures , which strongly influence the temperature dependence of @xmath50 in zero field .",
    "thus , we performed the mean - field calculation for a magnetic field of 14  t , which is large enough to strongly broaden the transition and to induce a sizable gap in the excitation spectrum .    within a mean - field approximation",
    "the internal energy per mol formula units of a heisenberg ferromagnet can be expressed by @xcite : @xmath59 here , @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote avogadro s constant and boltzmann s constant , respectively , @xmath62 is the spin number , @xmath63 the bohr magneton , @xmath58 the zero - field transition temperature , and @xmath64 the saturation magnetization .",
    "thus , the only parameter to be calculated is the temperature and magnetic - field dependent magnetization @xmath65 . as described in standard textbooks",
    "@xcite , @xmath65 follows from an implicit equation that can be solved numerically . from equation  ( [ emag ] ) the magnetic contribution to the molar heat capacity is calculated via @xmath66 and the magnetic entropy is obtained via integration @xmath67 .",
    "the result can be used as a consistency check of the calculation , because @xmath68  j / molk has to be reached for all magnetic fields when the integration is done to large enough temperatures .",
    "the experimental magnetic entropy change of euc@xmath0 is obtained by the integration @xmath69 .",
    "for the zero - field data , this integration yields @xmath70  j / molk , which is very close to the expected value of an @xmath17 system .",
    "strongly resembles the corresponding specific heat data .",
    "the phonon contribution is estimated by a @xmath71 law @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "[ tad],width=302 ]    fig .",
    "[ tad ] displays the zero - field linear thermal expansion of euc@xmath0 in the representation @xmath74 versus @xmath75 .",
    "obviously , the shape of this curve with a pronounced anomaly at @xmath76  k and a maximum around 4  k very strongly resembles the @xmath48 data shown in fig .",
    "[ hc ] . for the further analysis",
    "we again assume the superposition of phononic and magnetic contributions @xmath77 and estimate @xmath78 by a quadratic fit of the zero - field @xmath79 data in the temperature range above 25  k ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ tad ] ) .",
    "an approximate proportionality between thermal expansion and specific heat is often observed in solids and is related to the grneisen scaling , which can be straightforwardly derived from maxwell s relations for systems that are determined by a single energy scale  @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg ferromagnet with nearest neighbor exchange @xmath80 is such a system and it has been shown explicitly  @xcite that the magnetic contributions of the specific heat and thermal expansion are expected to scale with each other with a proportionality constant that is determined by the pressure ( or volume ) dependence of @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the magnetic contribution of the thermal expansion coefficient can be expressed as @xmath81 the additional factor of 3 in the denominator takes into account that @xmath82 is the linear thermal expansion , which in case of a polycrystal is 1/3 of the volume expansion .",
    "[ tadcp ] compares the zero - field data of @xmath82 and @xmath50 , which are obtained by subtracting @xmath78 and @xmath51 from the respective measurements . in the lower panel of this figure",
    "we show the ratio @xmath83 , which is practically constant in the temperature range from about 2 to 22  k. the peak in the close vicinity of t@xmath84 may partly arise from small differences in the temperature calibrations of the different experimental setups for the thermal expansion and the specific heat measurements .",
    "an additional source for this deviation are differences in the critical behavior of @xmath82 and @xmath50 .    .",
    "the ratio @xmath85 ( bottom ) is essentially constant in the entire temperature as expected from a grneisen scaling .",
    "[ tadcp],width=302 ]    the measurements of thermal expansion and specific heat also allow to derive the initial slope of the @xmath86 at ambient pressure . in case of a second - order phase transition this pressure dependence is given by the ehrenfest relation @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote the mean - field jumps of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "because there are no sharp jumps in @xmath4 and @xmath3 , one could approximate the experimentally obtained anomalies by jumps using , e.g. , area - conserving constructions or it is possible to obtain a measure of @xmath92 from a scaling of the anomalies of @xmath4 and @xmath3 in the vicinity of @xmath58 .",
    "this second possibility expresses a reformulation of eq .",
    "( [ ehren ] ) in the form of eq .",
    "( [ grueneisen ] ) , where @xmath80 is exchanged by @xmath58 . within mean - field theory @xmath58 and @xmath80 are proportional to each other and therefore @xmath93 meaning that eqs .",
    "( [ ehren ] ) and  ( [ grueneisen ] ) are equivalent .",
    "although this strict equality will not be valid in reality due to the presence of fluctuations , one may expect an approximate equality of eqs .",

    "[ tadcp ] the ratio @xmath94  mol / j over most of the temperature range and increases to @xmath95  mol / j around @xmath58 .",
    "thus , using @xmath96  cm@xmath28 we estimate the hydrostatic pressure dependences @xmath98 corresponding to an initial slope @xmath99  k / gpa .",
    "thus , we conclude that external pressure should cause a strong increase of the ferromagnetic transition temperature of euc@xmath0 arising from a strong spin lattice coupling .     for different magnetic fields .",

    "( [ alphamag ] ) , respectively .",
    "[ tadcpfeld],width=302 ]    in the upper panel of fig.[tadcpfeld ] the experimental magnetic contribution of the specific heat measured for different magnetic fields is compared to the respective @xmath50 calculated via eq .",
    "( [ cmag ] ) . as already mentioned the mean - field calculation only yields a poor description of the zero - field data , because it neither reproduces the spin - wave contribution in the low - temperature region nor the behavior around @xmath58 .",
    "the experimental data obtained in 2 and 5  t are , however , rather well described , in particular in the high - temperature range .",
    "there are still deviations at low temperatures , but with increasing field these deviations decrease .",
    "note that the data for 14 t is not shown here , because this measurement was used to estimate the phonon contribution @xmath50 .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[tadcpfeld ] displays the magnetic contribution of the thermal expansion @xmath82 for different magnetic fields , which behaves very similar as @xmath50 . for a ferromagnet with pressure dependent exchange interaction ,",
    "mean - field theory predicts an anomalous length change @xmath100 , which is proportional to the squared magnetization @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "thus , for the magnetic thermal expansion @xmath102 is expected and , in order to emphasize the close analogy between @xmath82 and @xmath50 , we express the magnetic thermal expansion as @xmath103 this expression is identical to the first term of eq .",
    "( [ cmag ] ) multiplied by a constant factor @xmath104 , which is determined by the scaling behavior of the zero - field data shown in fig .",
    "[ tadcp ] , i.e.  @xmath105  mol / j .",
    "thus , all parameters of eq .",
    "( [ alphamag ] ) are fixed and @xmath82 calculated for different fields is shown by the solid lines in fig .  [ tadcpfeld ] .",
    "again , there are strong deviations concerning the zero - field data , whereas the agreement is satisfactory already for a field of 2  t and is getting better with further increasing field .",
    "it is interesting to note that according to the mean - field equations  ( [ cmag ] ) and  ( [ alphamag ] ) the scaling of the zero - field @xmath82 and @xmath50 is no longer valid in finite magnetic fields .",
    "this mean - field result is confirmed by the experimental data , despite the fact that the mean - field calculations do not reproduce the respective zero - field data : fig .",
    "[ tadcp ] confirms the scaling of the experimental zero - field data of @xmath106 and @xmath57 and in fig .",
    "[ tadcpfeld ] it is seen that this scaling changes in a finite magnetic field , because the flattening of the zero - field anomaly is more pronounced for @xmath82 than for @xmath50 .    from the thermodynamic data presented above we find that the magnetization as well as the magnetic contributions of the specific heat and the thermal expansion are satisfactorily described within a mean - field theory assuming eu@xmath16 ions with localized @xmath17 moments coupled via a pressure - dependent exchange coupling @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , these data do not show any indications for field- or temperature - induced changes of the eu valence , in agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "mbauer measurements done in this previous work detected a small , but temperature - independent fraction of about @xmath107 of eu@xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath109  % reduction of the measured @xmath40 and @xmath41 compared to the expected values for an @xmath17 system could also be explained by such an amount of eu@xmath108 , because eu@xmath108 only has a weak paramagnetic van vleck susceptibility .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether such an eu@xmath108 content is an intrinsic property of euc@xmath0 , since it might also arise from a sample - dependent off stoichiometry and/or a weak oxygen contamination .",
    "the influence of weak off stoichiometries is also subject of intense studies in the closely related euo , see e.g.  ref .  , and it is found that the electrical resistivity can be drastically changed by weak variations of the eu : o ratio . if euc@xmath0 is considered as a purely ionic compound composed of eu@xmath16 and c@xmath8 ions , a semiconducting behavior would be expected over the entire temperature .",
    "this simple ionic picture is , however , contradicted by the measured resistivity @xmath13 showing an insulator - to - metal transition that coincides with the ferromagnetic ordering in zero - field  @xcite .",
    "moreover , euc@xmath0 shows a giant magneto resistance effect in finite magnetic fields with resistivity changes of several orders of magnitude around @xmath58 .",
    "thus , euc@xmath0 behaves very similar to euo .",
    "samples prepared for different e : c ratios ( see experimental section ) .",
    "the black lines represent the curves for constant activation energies @xmath110 .",
    "it is noticeable that the off - stoichiometric samples have a considerably smaller @xmath110 .",
    "[ resistivityplot],width=302 ]    in order to get more insight about the influence of stoichiometry , the synthesis of euc@xmath6 samples has been performed .",
    "[ resistivityplot ] compares the resistivity of two nominally stoichiometric euc@xmath9 samples and two off - stoichiometric samples that are expected to be either eu- or c@xmath9-deficient , i.e.  nominally electron- or hole - doped .",
    "the qualitative behavior for all samples is rather similar . upon decreasing the temperature down to @xmath58 ,",
    "the resistivity continuously increases , then @xmath13 strongly decreases below @xmath58 and finally becomes practically temperature - independent below about 7  k. based on the opposite temperature dependences above and below @xmath58 , one may discuss this as an insulator - to - metal transition , but in view of the rather large absolute values of @xmath15 below @xmath58 , it is also appropriate to consider an insulator - to - insulator transition . concerning the maxima , the nominally stoichiometric samples reach @xmath111 cm .",
    "the maximum for the nominally eu - deficient sample is still larger than @xmath112 cm , while in the c@xmath0-deficient sample a broadened plateau is observed with @xmath113 cm in the temperature range from about 12 to 20  k. moreover , the low - temperature resistivity of euc@xmath114 is about one order of magnitude lower than @xmath15 of the other samples . in the temperature range above @xmath115",
    "k , the resistivity of all samples decreases more or less linearly in the arrhenius plot , i.e. , there is an activated behavior @xmath116 with a temperature - independent activation energy @xmath110 .",
    "it is remarkable that both off - stoichiometric samples have a similar @xmath117k in the paramagnetic phase , whereas the stoichiometric samples have a significantly larger activation energy @xmath118k .",

    "it is not possible to give a precise determination of the real composition of the studied sample , which would be necessary to estimate the charge - carrier content .",
