    "ideas originating from the ads / cft correspondence found a surprisingly rich set of applications in the description of strongly coupled qcd plasma . at first sight",
    "this may indeed seem surprising since the prototype case of @xmath12 supersymmetric yang - mills theory is very different from qcd .",
    "for instance the former is a conformal theory while the latter is not .",
    "however , the application is to qcd in the deconfined phase and for large temperatures qcd is actually close to being conformal .",
    "there are other reasons too why it is perhaps not an accident that ads / cft inspired ideas work better than expected @xcite .",
    "one particular instance where ads / cft based arguments provide a good description of experimental data is the case of transport coefficients . in heavy ion experiments a fairly good description of the data",
    "can be achieved using ( classical ) hydrodynamical models and the coefficients of the corresponding navier - stokes equation can be determined from measurements . these and in particular the @xmath13 value of the anisotropy of the observed flow @xcite point to the fact that the qcd plasma is an almost perfect fluid .",
    "a dimensionless quantity can be formed from another coefficient , the shear viscosity @xmath14 and the entropy density @xmath15 which experimentally turns out to be rather small , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "based on the aforementioned ads / cft ideas a universal lower bound was conjectured @xmath17 for a large class of quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "this bound is known to be saturated by @xmath18 super yang - mills theory at large t hooft coupling and large @xmath19 in which limit the gravity dual is weakly coupled and the calculation is tractable on the gravity side .",
    "the first corrections at finite @xmath19 and t hooft coupling was shown to be positive and hence comply with the conjectured bound @xcite .    one argument supporting the universal lower bound conjecture",
    "is that the energy - time uncertainty relation can be reformulated entirely in terms of @xmath1 using the quasi particle picture @xcite .",
    "the lower bound of the uncertainty relation yields a lower bound for @xmath1 .",
    "however the precise set of quantum field theories where the bound is expected to hold is not clearly formulated .",
    "counter examples are known which served to limit the conjectured validity of the bound @xcite . as a result",
    "it is not clear what precise statement should be proved or disproved and a case - by - case approach seems more fruitful @xcite .",
    "some of the studied cases satisfy the bound while some do not .",
    "the counter examples in @xcite fall into two types . in one of them",
    "the number of particle species is very large , in the other the number of excitations of a particle are very large . while these constructions are convincing perhaps the conjectured bound can be valid in a limited sense . in any case",
    "this issue is far from being settled @xcite .",
    "the second type of construction in @xcite may be realised in the framework of quantum field theory as infinitely many peaks finally melting into a continuum .",
    "this suggests that a good candidate for violating the proposed lower bound should contain a strong continuum preferably with no quasi particle peaks in the spectral function i.e. it should be neither bose nor fermi gas .",
    "apart from models with known gravity duals analytic computations were done in qcd using the quasi particle approach @xcite and recently using perturbation theory in qed @xcite .",
    "these studies yield @xmath20 . clearly , when perturbation theory is applicable the coupling is small and the above ratio is large . and vica versa , a small measured value of this quantity hints at a large value of the coupling constant .",
    "newer calculations @xcite suggest however that higher order quasi particle processes may still lead to small viscosity even in the perturbative regime .",
    "a non - perturbative calculation of @xmath1 has been attempted using a lattice discretization in @xmath21 pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "unfortunately even in cases where a reasonable ansatz is available for the spectral function e.g. a transport peak structure , quantitative details are very difficult to extract from correlation functions @xcite .    using the large @xmath22 expansion of the 2pi effective action , which formalism sums an infinite set of diagrams , transport coefficients were calculated in @xcite .",
    "it was found that for large fermion masses the shear viscosity can be arbitrarily small .    in this paper",
    "the @xmath23 ratio of pure @xmath0 yang - mills theory will be calculated on a euclidean lattice at strong coupling for @xmath24 .",
    "the actual final result is @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 at temperatures close to the deconfinement transition .",
    "we find a vanishing @xmath1 ratio at @xmath25 , however the systematic uncertainties inherent in the strong coupling expansion are hard to estimate .",
    "similar calculations for transport coefficients have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling expansion has several conceptual difficulties not specific to the observable we calculate @xcite .",
    "since on the lattice with decreasing lattice spacing the bare coupling constant is going to zero , we can not approach the continuum limit .",
    "the commonly used strategy is trying to express the results in terms of physical quantities , which are then interpreted as renormalized quantities .",
    "another issue is the presence of the roughening transition which makes it impossible to reach temperatures higher than a certain value . despite of these difficulties",
    ", however , the strong coupling expansion not only works rather well for describing several concepts in the confined phase such as chiral symmetry breaking and confinement but also quantitatively @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "first the shear viscosity is calculated in section [ sec : shear ] .",
    "the calculation is based on the kubo formula , which will be related to the lattice plaquette - plaquette correlator . in the strong coupling regime",
    "the plaquette - plaquette correlators are dominated by elongated tube - like surfaces .",
    "a subclass of such simple surfaces as well as more complicated ones involving a loop wrapping around the finite imaginary time direction are resummed in section [ sec : t1loop ] leading to a final formula for @xmath14 . in section [ sec : entropy ]",
    "the entropy is calculated from the derivative of the free energy . in section [ sec :",
    "ratio ] we calculate the shear viscosity to entropy ratio in the limit of the temperature being close to the transition point . section [ sec : discussion ] concludes with a discussion of our findings .",
    "the shear viscosity is one of the linear response coefficients coming from the response of the energy momentum tensor to an external current coupled to the energy momentum tensor itself @xcite . given the correlation function @xmath26\\,}\\right\\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the trace - less part of the spatial components of the energy momentum tensor , the shear viscosity is the leading coefficient of its fourier transform @xmath28 for small frequency and zero spatial momentum , @xmath29    first we assume that we are at zero temperature and find a simple representation for the energy - momentum correlation function .",
    "we will work in euclidean space and start with the definition , @xmath30 from which the following symmetry properties are evident , @xmath31    for the shear viscosity we will compute the following euclidean expression : @xmath32    at zero temperature we have @xmath33 rotational invariance in euclidean space which can be used to relate the value of @xmath34 at a generic @xmath35 argument to the value of @xmath36 at @xmath37 .      to this end @xmath36",
    "is decomposed into invariant tensors compatible with the symmetry properties ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "the most general such tensor depending on @xmath35 can be written as , @xmath38 where the coefficient functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 can only depend on @xmath44 . using this formula at coordinate @xmath45",
    "we obtain the following special cases @xmath46 from the above formulae one can express the functions @xmath47 as linear combinations of certain components of @xmath48 , @xmath49 after contracting @xmath48 appropriately in order to get @xmath50 at any generic @xmath35 argument we arrive at , @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "this can be rewritten using ( [ inv2 ] ) as @xmath53 in the above formula the @xmath48 components on the right hand side are evaluated at the point @xmath37 .      all of the above manipulations were done in the continuum and now we will switch to the lattice by writing some of the energy momentum tensor components in terms of plaquette variables @xmath54 @xcite , @xmath55\\,,\\ ] ] or more explicitly , @xmath56 \\nn \\\\    & & t_{11 } = \\frac{\\beta}{n } \\left [ -p_{10 } -p_{12}-p_{13 } + p_{20 } + p_{30 } + p_{32 } \\right ] \\nn \\\\    & & t_{22 } = \\frac{\\beta}{n } \\left [ -p_{20 } -p_{21}-p_{23 } + p_{10 } + p_{30 } + p_{31 } \\right ]",

    "as we will see , at small @xmath10 i.e. large coupling , the leading and equal contributions come from @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ". hence we can write @xmath61 at leading order .    for the shear viscosity",
    "we need the fourier transform of @xmath34 at momentum @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 the @xmath60 term only depends on @xmath44 and the terms containing the @xmath65 variable only depend on the angles . for small @xmath66",
    "one may substitute the @xmath67 term with its integral over the angles , @xmath68 thus the plaquette - plaquette correlator is needed for plaquettes in the @xmath69 plane .",
    "the plaquette - plaquette correlator , @xmath70 , will be calculated via the strong coupling expansion .",
    "the wilson lattice formulation of pure @xmath0 gauge theory is used and the action is , @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the bare coupling constant , the sum is over all plaquettes @xmath74 of the lattice and @xmath75 is the plaquette variable built out of the links @xmath76 in the usual way .    the strong coupling expansion amounts to an expansion in small @xmath10 ; for details see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "using the characters @xmath77 of @xmath0 there is an expansion which sums over all irreducible representations @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the dimension of the representation and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are some coefficients .",
    "these coefficients will be expanded in @xmath10 .    at leading order for the group @xmath0 we have @xcite , [ eq : af ] c ( ) & = & 1 + a_f ( ) & = & \\ {    l n=2 +   +",
    "n > 2    .. where @xmath83 refers to the fundamental representation .    the plaquette - plaquette correlator can be computed from the partition function if the coupling @xmath10 is changed temporarily to @xmath84 and @xmath85 at the two plaquettes and remains @xmath10 elsewhere @xmath86    the logarithm of the partition function is computed by forming closed connected surfaces and assigning representations to the plaquettes of the surface following the usual recipe of the strong coupling expansion @xcite .",
    "to leading order the fundamental representation is assigned to each plaquette leading to the contribution @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the expansion coefficient from ( [ exp ] ) corresponding to the fundamental representation , @xmath89 is its dimension and @xmath90 is the number of plaquettes on the surface .",
    "the leading order terms in the expansion of @xmath88 were given in ( [ eq : af ] ) .",
    "the smallest surfaces spanning between well separated plaquettes are tube - like objects : they are closed at both end , and go almost straight from one plaquette to the other .",
    "an extra factor comes from the fact that the orientation of the tube and the orientation of the plaquette is not necessarily the same . in table",
    "[ tab : factors ] we summarize these extra factors for the orientations that appear in ( [ hejho ] ) .",
    "@xmath91 & @xmath60 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 & @xmath94 1 & @xmath95 & @xmath95 & 1 & @xmath95 & @xmath95 & @xmath96    to estimate the value of @xmath94 we recall that in terms of plaquettes its expression is @xcite , @xmath97 where @xmath98 the minimal surface which contains all the plaquettes of the above formula contains ( in addition to the tube contribution ) extra 2 plaquettes .",
    "therefore the 4-plaquette expectation value has an extra contribution of @xmath99 which explains the last column of table [ tab : factors ] .",
    "hence we are indeed left with the single contribution of @xmath60 as promised .",
    "the logarithm of the partition function in at leading order is then @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the open tube contribution , leading to @xmath102 where @xmath103{ll }        1\\qquad & \\mathrm{for}\\ ; n=2 \\cr        1/4\\qquad & \\mathrm{for}\\ ; n>2 \\cr      \\end{array }      \\right.\\ ] ]    therefore the quantity we are interested in is simply , @xmath104      now we proceed with the calculation of the open tube correlation function @xmath101 .",
    "the lowest order contribution from the surface which includes plaquette @xmath74 on the hypersurface at @xmath105 and at @xmath106 , both having the same spatial position , is the straight tube giving , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the glueball mass . the subscript `` str '' stands for straight . for generic end points we have @xmath109 .",
    "we will need its fourier transform , @xmath110 where @xmath111    to evaluate the shear viscosity we have to calculate the imaginary part of the retarded propagator of the corresponding energy - momentum tensor components , and up to now we calculated the euclidean propagator .",
    "but the retarded and the euclidean propagators are related as @xmath112 whereas from the retarded green function one obtains the spectral function as @xmath113 where disc stands for discontinuity . thus the retarded green function from ( [ hejho1 ] ) and ( [ hejho2 ] ) is @xmath114 with landau prescription , @xmath115 .",
    "the spectral function then reads , @xmath116 the spectral function exhibits a mass gap ; it is zero below @xmath117 , the glueball mass .",
    "now that we have the contribution of a straight line ( tube ) we will also add the contribution of zig - zagging lines with arbitrary number of joints .    [ fig : zigzag ]     a zig - zagging line with one joint has the following contribution , @xmath118 which turns into @xmath119 in fourier space .",
    "similarly , the contribution of zig - zagging lines with @xmath90 joints is @xmath120 .",
    "summing them all leads to , @xmath121 the calculation is completely analogous to the usual self - energy summation in ordinary perturbation theory .",
    "the spectral function corresponding to this resummation is @xmath122 where we have introduced @xmath123 the spectral function is plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectralfunction ] .",
    "[ fig : spectralfunction ]   ( solid line ) and unresummed ( dashed line ) .",
    "the two curves differ only in the threshold region .",
    "the resummed spectral function exhibits a peak and a smooth threshold behaviour.,title=\"fig:\",height=264 ]    by resumming the contribution of all zig - zagging lines with an arbitrary number of joints and arbitrary location for these joints we have essentially resummed the contribution of all curves since any curve can be approximated by zig - zagging lines .",
    "this resummation changed the spectral function in an essential way only near the threshold : it goes to zero at the threshold at @xmath124 and exhibits a peak at @xmath125 note that it smeared out the divergence at the threshold of the straight tube case .",
    "nonetheless the zig - zagging resummation really affects only the vicinity of the threshold ; for example , at @xmath126 the zig - zagging propagator is smaller than the straight line propagator only by @xmath127 .",
    "the spectral function above may be interpreted as a quasi particle ( with mass @xmath128 , cf . , and width proportional to @xmath129 ) .",
    "we must , however , not forget about the presence of the continuum , which may alter some of the consequences coming from the quasi particle assumption .",
    "so far we were at zero temperature where according to the contribution to the viscosity is zero because of the presence of the mass gap . at finite temperature the finite imaginary time direction and periodic boundary conditions has to be taken into account leading to , @xmath130 this , however , does not change the spectral function and only introduces the usual bose factor @xmath131 into the spectral representation of the green functions .",
    "the zero temperature spectral representation , @xmath132 turns into @xmath133 at finite temperature where on the right hand side the zero temperature spectral function appears . as a consequence",
    "the retarded green function will remain the same as at zero temperature , @xmath134 .",
    "so far we have included all single tube contributions , even the ones wrapping around the imaginary time direction , but did not find any nonzero contribution below the mass gap @xmath117 .",
    "this is expected also when we examine local modifications of the propagator , since these only modify the value of the mass gap @xcite . as a hint for what types of diagrams could be relevant",
    ", we recall that at weak coupling the phenomenon of landau damping is similar ; it yields nonzero contribution to the imaginary part of the propagator below the light cone at finite temperature , while this region is excluded at zero temperature .",
    "the most important diagram resulting in landau damping is a loop diagram , where one propagator is wrapping around the imaginary axis , while the other is not .",
    "we also include the effect of a 1-loop strong coupling diagram , see figure [ fig : loop ] .",
    "in complete analogy to ordinary perturbation theory a self - energy can be introduced and the retarded self - energy can be expressed from the zero temperature one as @xcite @xmath135 since each of the two joints of the one - loop diagram gives a factor of @xmath136 .    using this retarded self - energy the full one - loop corrected spectral function @xmath137 corresponding to the plaquette - plaquette correlator is @xmath138 for the viscosity the above expression is needed at zero spatial momentum and small frequency where @xmath139 has no imaginary part , only a non - vanishing real part .",
    "on the other hand @xmath140 can be neglected to leading order in the denominator .",
    "therefore near zero frequency we have , @xmath141 since @xmath142 we obtain , @xmath143 from we find @xmath144 where we also used to substitute the leading order value for @xmath88",
    ".    using at @xmath145 the following four combinations of step functions will appear in ( [ haliho ] ) , @xmath146 the first two is nonzero only when @xmath147 or @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "therefore they do not give contribution at small frequency .",
    "the remaining two terms yield for @xmath149 , @xmath150 clearly for vanishing momentum @xmath151 as it should be .",
    "the linear term in @xmath66 is then , @xmath152    a further simplification is possible since it is consistent with all previous approximations to truncate the expansion @xmath153 at the first term because the neglected terms contribute as much as higher loop diagrams .",
    "this leads to , @xmath154 which in turn yields the following result for the spectral function corresponding to the plaquette - plaquette correlator using ( [ rhot ] ) , @xmath155    ultimately we can express @xmath14 collecting all relations from ( [ uuu ] ) , ( [ visc ] ) , ( [ blabla ] ) and ( [ mandglat ] ) @xmath156",
    "the entropy density is the derivative of the free energy density with respect to temperature .",
    "the free energy in the strong coupling expansion is coming from closed and connected surfaces similarly to the discussion in section ( [ csakany ] ) .",
    "the first temperature dependent contribution to the free energy and hence the first non - vanishing contribution to the entropy comes from surfaces wrapping around the imaginary time direction .",
    "the first contribution is again from a thin straight tube line wrapping around once .",
    "the value of the dimensionless free energy density corresponding to such a straight tube has been calculated in @xcite @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 comes from the fact that for @xmath5 the fundamental representation and its complex conjugate are two different representations .",
    "the factor of 3 comes from the 3 possible orientation of the tube ( 12 , 13 and 23 ) .    in exactly the same way as was done for the calculation of the viscosity one needs to take zig - zagging as well as 1-loop diagrams into account . to be able to collect these effects the free energy density is written as @xmath160",
    "now we can use the spectral representation of the propagator and write @xmath161 the approximation @xmath162 is valid just as before since the higher loop diagrams are not taken into account .",
    "within this approximation one arrives at , @xmath163 and using the specific form of the spectral function from we find @xmath164    the entropy density from here is then , @xmath165 note that the resulting entropy is independent of @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "this result will be used in the next section to calculate the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio .",
    "our final goal is the ratio @xmath1 and using ( [ viscfinal ] ) and ( [ entropyfinal ] ) from the previous sections one obtains , @xmath167 where the following short hand notation is introduced @xmath168 it is worth emphasizing that all dependence on @xmath19 have dropped out completely ( even for finite @xmath19 ) as expected from naive counting of degrees of freedom .",
    "both the entropy density and the shear viscosity are expected to scale as @xmath166 and hence the ratio is expected to be independent of @xmath19 in accordance with our formula ( [ etaperes0 ] ) .    in order to evaluate ( [ etaperes0 ] )",
    "expressions of the type @xmath169 are needed .",
    "the computation of these terms is greatly simplified by the fact that in the strong coupling expansion @xmath170 is small .    a convenient coordinate system to use is @xmath171 and the relevant quantities then are given by _",
