    "for the last decades , a strong research effort has been devoted to study how quantum effects may be employed to manipulate and transmit information , in what is called quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "these research activities lead to new information - processing protocols with no classical counterpart , like quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite or quantum computing @xcite .",
    "quantum key distribution , in particular , is on its way from research laboratories into the real world .",
    "fiber and free - space links have been realized linking nodes at larger and larger distances @xcite with higher and higher key generation rates .",
    "network structures have also been demonstrated recently , for example the darpa network in boston @xcite and the secoqc network in vienna @xcite .",
    "however , current fiber and free - space links can not implement a real global - scale quantum key distribution system .",
    "fiber links have the advantage that the photon transfer is scarcely affected by external conditions , like background light , weather or environmental obstructions . on the other hand",
    "the extension of fiber links beyond few hundred kilometers is problematic , due to attenuation and polarization - preservation issues .",
    "terrestrial free - space links show some advantages : the atmosphere provides low absorption and is essentially non - birefringent , allowing almost unperturbed propagation of polarization states . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical mode is not confined in a waveguide , so they are extremely sensitive to the external environment : objects interposed in the line of sight , beam distortion induced by atmospheric turbulence , bad weather conditions and aerosols .",
    "a solution to this problem can be the use of space and satellite technology .",
    "space - based links can potentially lead to global - scale quantum networking since they allow a much larger propagation distance of photonic qubits compared to present terrestrial links .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that most of the propagation path is in empty space , with no absorption and turbulence - induced beam spreading , and only a small fraction of the path ( corresponding to less than 10 km ) is in atmosphere .",
    "however many technical problems must be overcome in order to realize a working quantum communication link between earth and space .",
    "geostationary satellites are too distant to implement a single photon link , therefore fast - moving low - orbit satellites ( leo orbit , from 500 to 2000 km above earth surface ) must be employed .",
    "several proof - of - principle experiments in this direction have been performed recently . in 2005 c .- z .",
    "peng and coworkers reported the first distribution of entangled photon pairs over 13 km , beyond the effective thickness of the aerosphere @xcite .",
    "this was a first significant step towards satellite - based global quantum communication , since it showed that entanglement can survive after propagating through the noisy atmosphere .    in 2007 two experiments were carried out at canary islands by a european collaboration .",
    "entanglement - based @xcite and decoy - state @xcite quantum key distribution was realized on a 144 km free - space path , linking la palma with tenerife . for these experiments the optical ground station of the european space agency , developed for standard optical communication between satellites and earth , was adapted for quantum communication .",
    "it is important to highlight that the twin - photon source was able to achieve coincidence production rates and entanglement visibility sufficient to bridge the attenuation expected for satellite - to - ground quantum channels .    in a successive experiment ,",
    "the feasibility of single - photon exchange for a down - link between a leo satellite and an optical ground station ( matera laser ranging observatory , in the south of italy ) was experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the researchers exploited the retroreflection of a weak laser pulse from a geodetic satellite covered with corner - cubes ( ajisai , orbiting at around 1400 km ) to simulate a single photon source on a satellite .",
    "they showed that , implementing a strong filtering in the spatial , spectral and temporal domain the emitted photons can be recognized against a very strong background .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the feasibility of satellite - based quantum communication which we believe have not yet been adequately discussed in the literature . in particular",
    ", we concentrate on two issues that were identified as crucial by the experiment performed at matera observatory @xcite : the possibility of a good signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and the polarization mainteinance in the link . as regards the snr we will refine the models already presented in the literature by introducing a detailed analysis of the effect of atmospheric turbulence and of the background stray - light in the case of a ground - to - satellite uplink .",
    "we will then discuss some filtering techniques to improve the snr reducing the noise level ; in particular we will analyse in detail the possibility of high - accuracy temporal filtering .",
    "finally , as long as polarization control is concerned , we will discuss and compare different strategies to implement a polarization - conserving channel .",
    "two crucial points for any communication system are the amount of attenuation of the link and the noise introduced in the system .",
    "this is even more important for quantum communication since the signal transmitted by alice is ideally one photon ( or a weak coherent pulse with very low mean photon number in many realistic implementations )",
    ". therefore one can not increase the signal power in order to have a good enough snr : the only available tools are the reduction of the link attenuation and of the background noise . in this section",
    "we will analyze a quantum channel between a ground station and a leo satellite both in the uplink and the downlink , presenting a model for the expected attenuation and background noise .",
    "the main factor limiting the performance of free - space optical communication is atmospheric turbulence , both for terrestrial horizontal links or for links between ground and satellites .",
    "atmospheric turbulence induces refractive index inhomogeneities , that increase the amount of spreading for traveling beams @xcite .",
    "in particular , turbulent eddies whose size is large compared to the size of the beam induce a deflection of the beam ( beam wandering ) , while smaller - scale turbulent features induce beam broadening . in other words , observing a beam which propagates through turbulent atmosphere at different time instants , one can see a broadened beam randomly deflected in different directions .",
    "when integrating the observation over a time - scale longer than the beam - wandering characteristic time , the global effect is a large broadening of the beam .",
    "models for optical beam propagation in the case of uplinks and downlinks between a satellite and a ground station have been discussed in the literature @xcite . in the case of a gaussian beam of waist @xmath0 and intensity @xmath1 ,",
    "the average long - term spot ( which is a superposition of moving short - term spots ) , tends theoretically to a gaussian spatial distribution of intensity @xcite : @xmath2 with width @xmath3 , where @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the short - term beam width , while @xmath6 is the instantaneous beam displacement from the unperturbed position .",
    "it can be shown that , for a collimated beam , the long - term beam width is @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the rayleigh parameter of the beam , @xmath9 is the propagation distance and @xmath10 is the fried parameter , given by : @xmath11^{-3/5}\\ ] ] the estimate of r0 in equation ( 4 ) was made by integrating the turbulent contribution of the atmosphere along the whole optical path .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 should then be considered a high bound , and the resulting conclusions as on the safe side .",
    "the refractive index structure constant @xmath12 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite to be : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the expression for the short - term width is : @xmath16 \\right \\}^2\\ ] ]    the receiving telescope can be described as a circular aperture of radius @xmath17 , which collects part of the incoming beam and focuses it on a bucket single - photon detector .",
    "the power @xmath18 received through a circular aperture of radius @xmath17 centered on the beam is : @xmath19    therefore the link - efficiency @xmath20 , which we define as the percentage of the received power with respect to the transmitted one is : @xmath21    the factor @xmath22 comprises the detection efficiency , the pointing losses and the atmospheric attenuation ; we take an empirical factor @xcite @xmath23 .",
    "some simulations for the link efficiency are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] : the link attenuation ( in decibels ) is shown as a function of the link distance @xmath9 and the radius @xmath17 of the receiving telescope . in the uplink",
    "the beam first travels through the turbulent atmosphere and then propagates , aberrated , in the vacuum to the satellite .",
    "the initial atmosphere - induced aberrations greatly increase the beam spreading , resulting in a very strong attenuation . for a relatively low satellite , at 500 km above the earth surface ,",
    "the attenuation is on the order of more than @xmath24 db .",
    "an interesting point is the relative contribution of the beam spreading due to smaller - scale atmospheric turbulence ( described by @xmath5 ) and the the beam - wandering induced by larger - scale eddies ( described by @xmath25 ) . in principle",
    "the beam wandering could be compensated by means of an active tip / tilt mirror with some kind of feedback loop . however , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , the benefit that one could get is below @xmath26 percent , making such compensation practically worthless .        during the day",
    "the main source of background noise is the sunlight reflected by the earth surface into the telescope field of view ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . let @xmath27 be the solar spectral irradiance ( photons/ @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 ) at one astronomical unit and @xmath31 the earth albedo ; assuming a lambertian diffusion , for which the radiance is independent of the angle , the spectral radiant intensity reflected by the earth ( number of photons per @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath32 ) is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the emitting area seen by the telescope and @xmath35 photons/ ( @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 ) at @xmath36 nm .",
    "such photons are collected by an optical system having entrance aperture raius @xmath37 and instantaneous field - of - view @xmath38 , at distance @xmath9 from the earth surface .",
    "therefore the emitting area is : @xmath39 and the solid angle from which the telescope on the satellite can be seen from earth is : @xmath40 therefore the number of background photons collected by the optical system per units of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is : @xmath43      the dominant sources of background radiation from the earth surface during night are its black - body emission and the reflected moon light . in realistic situations",
    "there will be a significant contribution of scattered light from human activities , which depends on the specific location considered .",
    "+ the number of photons per ( @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 ) emitted by a black body , according to planck s law , is : @xmath44 at @xmath45 k and @xmath46 nm , @xmath47 photons per ( @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 ) .",
    "let s now calculate the radiance due to moonlight reflection on the earth .",
    "given the solar spectral irradiance @xmath27 , the number of photons per @xmath28 and @xmath29 which hit the moon surface is : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the moon radius .",
    "assuming lambertian diffusion , the number of photons per ( @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath32 ) reflected by the moon is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the moon albedo .",
    "assuming the moon at normal incidence , the solid angle to the area on earth @xmath34 seen by the telescope is : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the distance earth - moon .",
    "the spectral radiant intensity after lambertian reflection from the earth surface is : @xmath54 the number of photons per second and @xmath29 of bandwidth entering the receiving telescope ( radius @xmath37 , field - of - view @xmath38 ) is : @xmath55 where : @xmath56 is the ratio between the background radiance at night - time ( full moon ) and day - time . assuming the moon albedo to be @xmath57 we have that @xmath58 is of the order of @xmath59 : during night - time , in full moon conditions , we have approximately a reduction of six orders of magnitude in the amount of background noise .        the effect of the atmospheric turbulence on a plane wavefront is a phenomenon very relevant to the fov limit in the noise reduction of a quantum channel , as seen above .",
    "in particular , the predominance of broadening of the beam or of the rapid bending of the beam , described by the long- and short - terms in the far - field width is a crucial information in order to design the optical system aimed at the mitigation of the turbulence effects .    to this purpose ,",
    "experimental data taken by means of a ground telescope are suitable to be compared to the modeling presented before . in our experiment we have acquired with a video recorder the flickering light from vega ( @xmath58-lyrae , magnitude=0 ) by the matera laser ranging observatory of agenzia spaziale italiana in matera , italy . the telescope has the primary mirror diameter of 1.5 m. the gathered light was spectrally filtered in the green by the coated optical components of the coud path , and acquired on the focal plane by a bidimensioanl sensor whose square pixel size was of 6.7 @xmath60 m .",
    "the collection of the frames were analyzed in order to extrac the first two moments of the intensity distribution .",
    "the results is reported in the figs .. ..      the background noise for a satellite - to - ground link was examined in details by miao et al . @xcite .",
    "the noise power @xmath61 received by a ground - based telescope pointing a satellite in the sky can be expressed as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the brightness of the sky background in @xmath64 , @xmath65 the field of view of the telescope in @xmath32 and @xmath37 its radius ; @xmath41 is the filter bandwidth .",
    "@xmath66 is strongly related to the weather conditions , for example during .",
    "we calculated the signal - to - noise ratio for the downlink using our results for the signal attenuation in a turbulent atmosphere and the noise parameters given in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] . on the left side ,",
    "the down - link attenuation is shown as a function of the link distance @xmath9 and the radius of the earth - based receiving telescope .",
    "two factors result in an increased performance for the downlink with respect to the uplink .",
    "first , on earth we can have larger receiving telescopes than in space .",
    "second , the beam first propagates in the vacuum with just diffraction spreading and gets in contact with the turbulent atmosphere only in the final stage of propagation .",
    "therefore the aberrations introduced by turbulence only affect weakly the wavefront before it enters the telescope .    on the right side of fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] we plotted the snr as a function of the sky brightness ( @xmath67 nm , @xmath38 ) . the snr is greater than one only at night - time .      as discussed in the previous sections , in order to have a significant signal - to - noise ratio to establish a quantum communication link , it is crucial to reduce the amount of noise .",
    "moreover , the management of detector dead - time is also a crucial point .",
    "avalanche single - photon detectors are characterized by a certain amount of time , after a detection event , in which they can not detect any more photons . for single - photon avalanche photodiodes the dead time can vary from 40 to 100 ns .",
    "for this reason the detection of a noise photon has a double negative effect : it decreases the final secure key rate and it blinds the detector for the duration of the dead time preventing the detection of a good photon .",
    "this is why very often qkd systems run in gated - mode : the detectors are switched - on only when a signal photon is supposed to arrive . to allow the possibility to gate the detectors",
    ", high - accuracy temporal synchronization is mandatory .",
    "filtering strategies can be divided in three categories : spectral , spatial and temporal .",
    "spectral filtering is pretty easy to implement even on a space setting , just employing interference filters which must be thermally stabilized .",
    "spatial filtering can be implemented acting on the receiving telescope field - of - view , in order to select only photons coming from the right directions .",
    "a trade - off must be found between the need of a strong spatial selectivity ( to have efficient noise - reduction ) and the possibility of imperfect pointing , which would call for a relaxation in spatial filtering .    in a space environment , time filtering is a more delicate issue , because it requires really good synchronization between two devices in fast relative motion .",
    "such precise synchronization is fundamental in order to discriminate the good photons from the background noise and in order to have gated - mode operation of the detectors . for the latter ,",
    "the arrival time of a signal photon need to be known in advance , in order to open the detector gate .",
    "let s focus to the case of an earth - based station sending photons to an orbiting receiver .",
    "two different schemes have been used in the literature to synchronize free - space qkd systems : self - synchronization and external synchronization .    in the case of self - synchronization a periodic bright pulse of a wavelength different from the one of the signal photons can be used to open the detector gate .",
    "this technique was used , for example , in one of the seminal experiments about free - space qkd by hughes and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the waveform of the pulses can be shaped in order to code in the synchronization frames some information regarding the communication itself .",
    "a different option is to use an external synchronization technique , for example stabilized local clocks and software - controlled phase - lock loop driven by the detected photon signal ( as described by rarity et al . in @xcite ) or by the global positioning system ( gps ) signal ( as done r. ursin and coworkers for entanglement distribution over 144 km in free - space @xcite ) . in the case of satellite - based quantum communication",
    "this technique requires the precise a priori knowledge of the orbit , which makes it extremely unpractical .    here",
    "we will focus on the self - synchronization technique , which we believe is easier to realize in practice and gives the signal for the detector - gating control with no need to know precisely the station - satellite distance .",
    "an interesting question is then what repetition rate shall be imparted to the synchronization pulses in order to keep a control on the satellite position on the order of the tens of centimeters ( which correspond to trip - times to the order of one nanosecond ) . in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] we show some data analysis performed on khz laser ranging data for the grace satellite acquired by the graz space research center . from the laser - ranging data we calculated the time derivative of the photon trip - time from ground to the satellite and we plotted it on a histogram .",
    "the results clearly show that the trip - time changes of the order of @xmath68 per second ( which corresponds to about 12 km per second ) .",
    "this means that if we want to keep track of the changes with an accuracy to the order of the nanosecond we need a repetition rate for the synchronization of the order of @xmath69 khz .",
    "a second crucial point for the implementation of quantum communication schemes based on polarization - encoded qubits is , of course , the preservation of polarization states in the channel .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , propagation in the atmosphere does not affect significantly the polarization stets , nor does the faraday effect due to the earth magnetic field .",
    "the use of curved optics in an off - axis configuration introduces some spatially - dependent polarization effects @xcite which can lead to global decoherence of the polarization - encoded qubits .",
    "however , the effect is small for on - axis optics and it can be neglected , just having some care in the design of optical systems .    on the other hand , the relative motion of the satellite and the ground station induces a time - dependent transformation on the polarization state as seen by the receiver .",
    "this is mainly due to the relative rotation of the satellite vertical axis with respect to ground and change in the polarization induced by reflection on mirrors at time - varying angles .",
    "the effect , in the case of a single passage of a leo satellite orbiting at 400 km from the earth surface , is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] : given a photon which is emitted with vertical - polarization in the satellite reference frame , the stokes parameter seen by the ground - based receiver are plotted as a function of time .",
    "if we can neglect channel depolarization effects , as it is the case for atmospheric propagation , polarization states can be represented by jones vectors : @xmath70   \\qquad a , b , \\varphi \\in r \\quad a^2+b^2=1\\ ] ] the channel properties are described by a 2-by-2 time - dependent jones matrix @xmath71 , which transforms the polarization states according to @xmath72 . to establish a successful quantum link based on polarization - encoded qubits , such transformation must be compensated .",
    "this can be done characterizing the channel without interfering with the single - photon exchange , in order to measure such matrix @xmath71 .",
    "then , applying the inverse transformation @xmath73 for every time instant @xmath74 to the incoming photons , the correct state can be restored before performing the measurements needed fro quantum key distribution .",
    "however , in general , not to interfere with the signal photon exchange , the characterization of the channel jones matrix is to be performed with different parameters than the photon exchange .",
    "for example , a different wavelength may be employed , or the two operations of channel - probing and quantum - communication can be performed at in different time - slots . defining @xmath75 as the experimentally measured channel jones matrix , we have : @xmath76 with @xmath77 in the case of ideal compensation .",
    "let @xmath78 be the elements of the matrix @xmath79 .    in this section we will discuss some polarization - compensation schemes , discussing their effectiveness in the case of the model presented in @xcite .",
    "considering a bb84 quantum key distribution scheme , photons are transmitted in two non - orthogonal bases , for example the horizontal / vertical one ( states @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) or the diagonal one ( states linearly polarized at @xmath82 degrees , that we will indicate respectively with @xmath83 and @xmath84 degrees ) .",
    "the average error probability is : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the temporal average of the conditional probability of measuring the state @xmath87 once @xmath88 has been transmitted ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "suppose now to have a horizontally - polarized state transmitted at time @xmath90 .",
    "after compensation , one gets the state : @xmath91 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array } \\right ] = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } e_{11 } ( t_i)\\\\ e_{21 } ( t_i ) \\end{array } \\right ] \\ ] ] so that the probability of obtaining the correct result is @xmath92 . assuming that the probability of transmitting a @xmath80 state is @xmath93 : @xmath94 with similar arguments one can find expressions for the other conditional probabilities so that : @xmath95      one possible way of measuring the channel jones matrix without perturbing the single - photon exchange is using a probe beam at a wavelength @xmath96 different from the one of the signal beam ( @xmath97 ) . in this case",
    "the signal transformation jones matrix is @xmath98 , while the compensation matrix is @xmath99 .",
    "thefore : @xmath100    to have a statistical evaluation of the degree of compensation that can be achieved with this technique we performed a simulation for 1000 passages of a leo satellite orbiting at 500 km .",
    "we used the model described in @xcite to calculate the matrices @xmath98 and @xmath101 for a uniform temporal sampling of each passage ( @xmath102 s ) .",
    "then we computed for each time instant the matrix @xmath103 and the error probability @xmath104 , finally averaging over time .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] , showing the qber due to compensation error as a function of @xmath105 .",
    "perfect compensation is clearly possible using a wavelength for the probe beam very close to that of the signal beam .",
    "however an acceptable error rate ( below one percent ) , is possible for wavelengths much more distant than our signal one .",
    "a different compensation scheme can be time - multiplexing of signal and probe pulses at the same wavelength in the channel . in this case , suppose to send the probe pulses with repetition rate @xmath106 , so that the m - th probe pulse will be emitted at time @xmath107 with @xmath108 . between any two probe pulses ,",
    "n single - photon pulses will be transmitted , each at the time @xmath109 where @xmath110 . in other words",
    ", we measure the channel jones matrix @xmath111 and use it to compensate n subsequent single - photon pulses : @xmath112 = c^{-1}(t_m^{(0 ) } ) j_0 \\left [   t_m^{(0 ) } + i \\delta \\right]\\ ] ]    the repetition rate of such pulses must be fast enough to characterize in real - time the evolution of the channel properties . assuming that this is the case , the amount of change for a stokes parameter @xmath113 at a time @xmath42 slightly after @xmath114 is small and can be expressed with a taylor expansion to the first order : @xmath115 if we want to keep the error on @xmath116 under a certain value @xmath117 , the repetition rate of the probing pulses must be : @xmath118    assuming a maximum value for the time - derivative of the stokes parameters of 0.02 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] ) , and stating for the maximum acceptable error on the stokes parameters @xmath119 , we get a value of @xmath120 khz for the probe repetition rate .",
    "this value is a large bound on the error , since @xmath121 is in general much smaller than the maximum value we took .    to have a statistical evaluation of the average error probability we performed some simulations similar to what we did for the different - wavelengths scheme . in this case",
    "we computed the probability error as a function of the repetition rate of the probe pulses .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] .",
    "in this section we will analyze the possibility of establishing a quantum key distribution link in different configurations employing a leo satellite and an optical ground station , for different protocols . throughout the whole section",
    ", formulas for key - generation rate in the asymptotic limit of a long key will be employed .",
    "this is clearly not true for real - world qkd experiments , especially in the cases involving the exchange of a secret key between a leo satellite and earth . at present , the analysis of the security of quantum key distribution for finite key lengths is still an open question [ ref ] in quantum information theory .      the secret key rate per pulse for the bb84 protocol in the case of an ideal single - photon source : @xmath122\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the probability that a non - empty pulse is detected by bob , @xmath124 is the qber , @xmath125 is the efficiency of error correction and @xmath126 is the binary entropy function : @xmath127 .",

    "the situation of decoy - state qkd with intensity fluctuations has been recently analyzed by xian - bin wang in @xcite , who showed that if the intensity - error of each pulse is random , the decoy - state protocol can work efficiently even in the case of large intensity errors .      a detailed analysis of the conditions to violate bell inequalities and implement a quantum key distribution experiment based on ekert s protocol has been presented in @xcite . as the minimum requirement",
    "they assume the snr needed to violate a bell - inequality @xcite .",
    "for the case of polarization - entangled photons this necessitates a coincidence visibility of at least 71 percent , corresponding to a snr of 6 : 1 .",
    "below that ratio it is possible to model the observed correlation with a local realistic theory , allowing unobserved eavesdropping .",
    "however , in the analysis they only consider the effect of dark counts , neglecting the effect of background noise .",
    "the rate of accidental coincidences is : @xmath144 while the rate of good coincidencres is : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the efficiency of the link @xmath87 . in our simulations",
    "we use the link efficiencies and the noise values calculated in section 2 for satellite links , while in the case of local detection we use @xmath147 and for the noise counts just the detector dark counts ( @xmath148 counyts per second ) .",
    "@xmath149 is the emission rate of the entangled - photon pairs : values of the order of @xmath150 pairs per second are currently available using for examples periodically - poled nonlinear crystals .",
    "we consider four different scenarios :    * source is on the satellite , with two ground receivers ( the scheme proposed for the spacequest experiment @xcite ) * source on the satellite with one local receiver and the other one on ground * source on ground , with two satellite - based receivers * source on ground with one local receiver and the other one on satellite    all simulations were performed for night - time new moon conditions .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[figure15 ] .",
    "it is clear that entanglement - based experiments with one photon measured locally at the source and the other one propagating either in the uplink or downlink are feasible , due to sufficient snr ( of the order of 100:1 to 1000:1 ) . on the other hand",
    "a ground - based source with two uplinks to satellite is clearly un - feasible .",
    "the situation with a source on the satellite and two earth - based receiving telescope is feasible , but only under some stringent requirements on the experimental parameters ( telescope diameter , link distance , filtering ... ) .",
    "in this paper we discussed some aspects of the feasibility of satellite - based quantum key distribution which we believe were not yet addressed in the literature .",
    "first of all , we discussed signal propagation through a turbulent atmosphere , refining the models presented in @xcite , @xcite . in particular for the uplink we analyzed the relative contribution of beam spreading and wandering , showing that the former is more important than the latter for low - altitude satellites .",
    "this makes the possibility of compensating the beam wandering with an active tip / tilt mirror not worth .",
    "then we introduced a model for the background noise of the channel during night - time and day - time , and we discussed the signal - to - noise ratio for different configurations .",
    "second , we discussed the polarization properties of a satellite - based quantum channel , discussing two possible compensation techniques to the effects illustrated in @xcite . for both techniques ( channel - probing at a different wavelength and time - multiplexing of signal and probe pulses at the same wavelength ) we showed that the bit error rate can be kept at really low levels .",
    "finally we discussed the generation rate of a secure key for different configurations and for different protocols .",
    "for the standard bb84 protocol ( with poissonian - distributed source ) we showed that a qkd link can be established for the downlink with a good generation rate , but not for the uplink . on the other hand",
    ", a qkd uplink can be realized with the more accurate estimate of the fraction of bits for which an eavesdropper could have complete information without introducing any disturbance , provide by the decoy - state techniques .",
    "two points are still unclear in our opinion : the effect of the finite duration of the satellite link to the securire key generation and the possibility to implement the decoy - state technique in a channel with strong and random intensity fluctuations .",
    "we also discussed the implementation of entanglement - based links , showing that configurations with one photon detected locally at the source and one propagating either in pulink or downlink is feasible with realistic experiemntal parameters .",
    "the situation with a source on satellite and two ground - based receivers is also feasile , but with particular care on the choice of the relevant hardware parameters .    in conclusion , we believe that satellite - based quantum key distribution is certainly feasible with present technology . we also believe that space technology can provide a rich environment for experiments on foundational quantum mechanics and on quantum - information applications .",
