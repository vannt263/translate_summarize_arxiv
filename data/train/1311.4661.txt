    "the figure shows that the rate of total entropy is positive throughout the evolution of the universe , hence the gsl is satisfied always at apparent horizon for these parameters with mhrde interacting with matter within the apparent horizon .",

    "but when the redshift is less than 2 , the gsl is found satisfy with limiting condition that @xmath93 so it can be concluded that the gsl is not satisfied through out the evolution of the universe .",
    "these results shows that the event horizon of the universe with interacting mhrde can not be taken as physical boundary for the thermodynamics of the universe .",
    "here will analyze the validity of the gsl by assuming that , the different components are not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "so the dark energy and dark matter were evolved with different temperature and the horizon have a still different temperature .",
    "this is strictly possible when there is no interaction between the components of the universe .",

    ", there occurs a flow of dark energy towards the apparent horizon . in literature",
    "there are examples for the anticipation of the flow of the fluid from within the horizon towards the horizon @xcite .",
    "this flow towards the apparent horizon would possibly lead to the crossing of the dark energy across the horizon .",
    "hence the entropy of the dark energy will decrease as the universe evolves .",
    "but the validity of the gsl in turn requires that , the decrease in the dark energy entropy is balanced by the increase in the horizon entropy such that the total entropy will never decrease .",
    "consider a universe dominated by dark energy .",
    "the entropy of the dark energy can be obtained from simple considerations as @xcite , @xmath103 where we have taken the temperature of the dark energy is proportional to the horizon temperature as , @xmath104 @xcite , @xmath105 is a numerical constant greater than one to ensure that the dark energy temperature is greater than that of the horizon .",
    "the entropy of the apparent horizon is , @xmath106 using the expressions ( [ eqn : h ] ) , ( [ eqn : dep ] ) and ( [ eqn : eos ] ) , we have plotted @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 and are shown in figures [ fig : darkentro ] and [ fig : totalentro ] , where @xmath110     for the model parameters ( 1.2,0.1 ) ]    ( bottom line ) and total entropy with @xmath111(top line ) for the model parameters ( 1.2,0.1 ) . ]    it is evident the figures that the entropy of the dark energy is decreasing , the entropy of the horizon is increasing and the total entropy comprising the entropies of the dark energy and horizon is also increasing as result the gsl is satisfied .",
    "in this work we have considered the flat frw universe filled with holographic ricci dark energy and dark matter and analyzed the validity of the gsl of thermodynamics at the apparent and event horizons of the universe .",
    "we have done the analysis for both thermal equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "we have first analyzed the validity of the gsl under thermal equilibrium conditions at which the temperature of the dark energy and dark matter were equal to the temperature of the horizon .",
    "the thermal equilibrium is achieved mainly through the interaction between the dark energy and dark matter .",
    "we have found that , with modified holographic ricci dark energy , the gsl is satisfied with apparent horizon as the boundary of the universe for all model parameters except ( 1.01,-0.01 ) .",
    "for the parameters ( 1.01,-0.01 ) , there exist a possibility for the universe to go into the phantom phase of expansion which seems to causes the partial violation of the gsl .",
    "hence the apparent horizon can be taken as the physical boundary for thermodynamic considerations as far as the universe doesnot entering the phantom phase of expansion or equivalently @xmath112 this conclusion is in agreement with many other works @xcite with different forms of dark energies . in the case of the universe with event horizon as the boundary",
    ", we have found that the gsl is partially satisfied for all the parameters including ( 1.01,-0.01 ) .",
    "for the parameters ( 1.01,-0.01 ) the gsl is satisfied at the recent past and recent future and violated in other regions .",
    "but for other parameters , it is clear form figure [ fig : gsl3 ] that , gsl is not satisfied in the past corresponding to redshift @xmath113 for @xmath114 , gsl is satisfied for all the model parameters with the condition @xmath115 because of this partial fulfillment of the gsl at the event horizon , it can not be taken as a physical boundary of the universe .",
    "this is also in tune with conclusion with other models of dark energy as noted in the reference cited above .    under non - equilibrium condition",
    "we have obtained the constraints imposed by the validity of the gsl at the apparent horizon . in this case the dark energy and dark matter are non - interacting , hence their temperatures are not equal and are different from the horizon temperature . we have found that for the gsl is to be satisfied the temperature of the dark energy must be greater than that of the apparent horizon .",
    "this implies that the dark energy can flow towards the horizon and even cross the horizon . as a result",
    "the entropy of the dark energy must decrease . on the other hand the entropy of the horizon and",
    "also the total entropy must increase which ensures the validity of the gsl .",
    "assuming the temperature of dark energy , @xmath116 , with @xmath117 we have calculated the entropies of dark energy and horizon .",
    "the evolution of these entropies , figures [ fig : darkentro ] and [ fig : totalentro ] , shows that the entropy of the dark is deceasing but the entropy of the horizon is increasing .",
    "the increase in the horizon entropy is compensating the decrease in the entropy of the dark energy , so that the total entropy is always increasing .",

    "<S> we explore the validity of the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics in flat frw universe with apparent horizon and event horizon as the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we found that in a universe with holographic ricci dark energy and dark matter , interacting with each other , the gsl is satisfied at the apparent horizon and partially satisfied at the event horizon under thermal equilibrium conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyses the gsl under non - equilibrium conditions and shows that the fulfillment of gsl at the apparent horizon implies that the temperature of the dark energy is greater than that of the horizon </S>",
    "<S> . thus there occurs a flow of dark energy towards the apparent horizon . as a result the entropy of the dark energy decreases and that of horizon increases </S>",
    "<S> this is verified by finding the evolution of the dark energy entropy and horizon entropy in a dark energy dominated universe under non - equilibrium conditions .    </S>",
