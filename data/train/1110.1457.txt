    "ly@xmath0  nebulae ( or ly@xmath0  `` blobs '' ) are extended sources at @xmath8 @xmath12 2  6 with typical sizes of the ly@xmath0 emission region of @xmath215  ( @xmath21 50 kpc ) and line luminosities of @xmath22 ergs@xmath14 , and are some of the most mysterious astronomical objects .",
    "the nature of the extended ly@xmath0  emission is poorly understood .",
    "for example , ly@xmath0  blobs may represent galaxies forming via cold gas accretion , galactic - scale outflows due to star formation , or the result of intense radiative feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .    to understand the nature of these ly@xmath0  blobs",
    ", we first need to constrain their energy budget , i.e. , the bolometric luminosities of the galaxies within or in the vicinity of the ly@xmath0  halos and compare the available energy with the observed ly@xmath0  luminosities .",
    "many ly@xmath0  blobs do not appear to contain bright uv continuum sources , bringing into question the nature of the underlying power source for these nebulae .",
    "infrared ( ir ) and ( sub)mm observations provide complementary information in such cases , by detecting and constraining the luminosity of any dust - enshrouded and obscured power - sources ( star - forming or agn ) within the nebula .",
    "so far , a handful of ly@xmath0  blobs have been detected in the far - ir ( fir ) , suggesting that at least some ly@xmath0  blobs contain energy sources that can power the entire ly@xmath0  luminosity if only a few percent of their bolometric luminosities are converted to ly@xmath0radiation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it appears that some ly@xmath0  blobs do not contain any obvious energy sources detectable at mid - ir or millimeter wavelengths @xcite ; in these cases the ly@xmath0  emission has been attributed to gravitational cooling due to cold mode accretion @xcite .    despite the enormous star formation rates indicated by the fir luminosities of some ly@xmath0  blobs ( up to @xmath12 1000@xmath20yr@xmath14 ) , their molecular gas content  where the stars should form ",
    "has been mostly unconstrained .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand whether there is enough cold molecular gas to power star formation in ly@xmath0  blobs or whether the molecular gas is depleted rapidly due to galactic - scale feedback either by superwind - driven shocks or photoionization by agn .",
    "in addition , if detected , carbon monoxide ( co ) lines that trace the molecular gas can be used to probe the kinematics and the excitation conditions of the surrounding gas .",
    "blobs also present an unique opportunity to investigate the molecular gas content in environments that differ significantly from sub - millimeter galaxies ( smg ) , high redshift quasars ( qsos ) or ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) that have been studied in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most luminous ly@xmath0  blobs share the common property that they reside in overdense environments @xcite , suggesting that they may represent the sites of massive galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , the discovery of spatially - extended @xmath231640 emission and very weak metal emission lines from a ly@xmath0  blob at @xmath24 suggests that the gas in the blob may be of low metallicity @xcite .    in this paper , we present new ( sub)mm observations of a @xmath25 ly@xmath0blob discovered by @xcite and measure its bolometric luminosity and dust properties .",
    "this blob ( sst24 j1434110 + 331733 ; hereafter labd05 ) was discovered in the noao deep and wide field survey botes field by its strong _ spitzer _ multiband infrared photometer ( mips ) 24@xmath2mflux , indicating that as an ir - bright source it may be an ulirg with a bolometric luminosity as large as 18 @xmath5 10@xmath26@xmath7 . while a 350@xmath2 m  flux density of labd05 had been measured as a part of a large caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) submillimeter high angular resolution camera ( sharc  ii ) program @xcite , the lack of ( sub)mm observations covering both sides of the thermal dust peak of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) prevented a direct constraint on its bolometric luminosity .    the best - studied ly@xmath0  blob ( ssa22-lab01 at @xmath27 ) in the ssa22 protocluster region discovered by @xcite",
    "has been reported to be associated with a bright smg from the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
