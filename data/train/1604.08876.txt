    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods have become an important tool in understanding the electronic structure for a multitude of systems including atoms , molecules , clusters and solids . in particular ,",
    "variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) have had great success in capturing the many - body correlation effects that influence material properties such as binding and cohesive energies , excitations , phase transitions , etc ; these properties are calculated to high accuracy and are in excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "dmc is a projector method that applies the operator @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the system hamiltonian , to an appropriate trial or variational wave function . in the imaginary time limit @xmath4 ,",
    "the ground state for a given symmetry is obtained while excited state contributions to the trial wave function are exponentially damped .",
    "plagued by the fermion sign problem , dmc applications to electronic systems often invoke the fixed - node ( fndmc ) approximation @xcite which fixes the nodal structure of the solution to that of an appropriate trial wave function , which is typically obtained from anti - symmetric combinations of ( post-)hartree - fock ( hf ) or density functional theory ( dft ) one - particle orbitals . in the case where the trial nodes are exact ,",
    "the exact ground state energy of the hamiltonian is obtained .",
    "approximate nodes yield variational estimates of the energy that in many cases proved to be remarkably accurate even for single - reference trial functions based on dft or hf orbitals .    despite its successes",
    ", fndmc actually solves only the spatial part of the eigenstate problem since in typical calculations the electronic spins are treated statically rather than as true quantum variables .",
    "this is perfectly adequate in systems where the hamiltonian does not include spin , and then the nontrivial part of the solution is reduced to spatial dependences only .",
    "the particular spin configuration of individual electrons is conserved and therefore is imposed as a symmetry of the system , e.g. , a singlet or triplet state",
    ". however , many interesting systems exhibit interactions between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom such as the spin - orbit interaction . for nuclear systems , the quantum nature of spins have been realized in variational@xcite and auxillary field monte carlo@xcite methods . in condensed matter applications ,",
    "a dmc method was implemented for the 2d homogeneous electron gas with rashba interaction @xcite as well as its modification to the vmc method applied to atoms@xcite . in these two approaches ,",
    "the spinor states are stochastically sampled as opposed to sampling the particle coordinate space that underlies the dmc methods .",
    "recently , we introduced a dmc method which keeps the trial spinors intact during the imaginary time evolution @xcite .",
    "this method is particularly useful in that it has the zero - variance property , namely that for arbitrary configurations ( spin and spatial coordinates ) the bias in energy is proportional to the square of the trial wave function error .",
    "since spin - orbit is nonlocal in the particle coordinate space , the method deals with spin - orbit terms in a manner similar to nonlocal pseudopotentials @xcite and , as we show below , many of the developed techniques then carry over .    in this paper ,",
    "we elaborate and expand upon the details and technical issues of the method introduced previously @xcite . in ",
    "[ section : fpdmc ] , we give a short discussion of the fixed - phase method in a configuration space without the spin degrees of freedom . in later sections ,",
    "we generalize the fixed - phase algorithm to incorporate varying spins and spin - dependent hamiltonians . in  [ section : spinorbit ] , we introduce one particular choice of spin - dependent hamiltonian , namely the spin - orbit interaction via a pseudopotential .",
    "we note that any spin - dependent hamiltonian could be included , however we choose to focus on the spin - orbit interaction . in ",
    "[ section : spin ] , we discuss the inclusion of the spin variables and our choice for the spin representation . in  [ section : errors ] , we discuss corresponding timestep dependences in evolutions of both spatial and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we present applications of the method to several atoms and molecules in ",
    "[ section : applications ] .",
    "we conclude in  [ section : conclusions ] .",
    "in order to include spin - dependent hamiltonians within dmc , we must work with inherently complex wave functions .",
    "fndmc nominally treats real - valued wave functions , so we must resort to a generalization of the method . before dealing with spin terms ,",
    "we present a short review of the fixed - phase method ( fpdmc ) @xcite and its relation to the fixed - node flavor of the dmc .    for an @xmath5-electron system",
    ", we work in a configuration space @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is dimensionality and here we assume @xmath8 . for now , we consider particle spin to be a label rather than a variable .",
    "we assume the born - oppenheimer approximation , so that we have the hamiltonian of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the electron - ion and electron - electron coulomb interactions .",
    "since the wave function @xmath12 is complex , we write @xmath13 and substitute into the imaginary - time schrdinger equation .",
    "this yields two coupled differential equations for the amplitude , @xmath14 , and phase , @xmath15 , as @xmath16 \\rho(\\mathbf{r},\\tau ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\\\",
    "-\\frac{\\partial \\phi(\\mathbf{r},\\tau)}{\\partial \\tau } & = & \\left [ t_{kin}+ \\frac{\\nabla \\rho(\\mathbf{r},\\tau ) \\cdot \\nabla}{\\rho(\\mathbf{r},\\tau ) } \\right ] \\phi(\\mathbf{r},\\tau )      \\label{phase - eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we abbreviate @xmath17 .",
    "in order to obtain an approximate solution , we invoke the fixed phase approximation by taking @xmath18 with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the phase of a trial or guiding wave function . writing the trial wave function as @xmath21",
    ", we obtain one expression for the fixed trial amplitude and phase @xmath22 so that @xmath23 .",
    "since the overall constant phase is irrelevant we can alternatively define @xmath24 so that we get @xmath25 .",
    "the stationary phase condition makes the equation ( [ phase - eqn ] ) moot , while the equation for the non - negative amplitude determines the energy eigenvalue .",
    "the fixed - phase approximation is variational since the repulsive potential @xmath26 can only raise the energy for an approximate phase @xcite .",
    "this is easy to see from the energy expectation with @xmath27 that must be an upper bound to the exact energy for an arbitrary symmetric @xmath28 .",
    "we note that the fixed - phase approximation is a generalization of the more familiar fixed - node approximation for a real - valued @xmath29 .",
    "let us show that explicitly .",
    "we denote the nodes of @xmath30 as @xmath31 consider another wave function @xmath32 that is symmetric , normalizable and real",
    ". it should be also nonvanishing and positive in the domain of @xmath29 .",
    "an appropriate prototype for @xmath33 can be , for example , an approximation to the bosonic ground state of @xmath3 .",
    "we construct a new complex trial function @xmath34 the potential that is generated by the phase of @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 away from the node @xmath38 the limit @xmath39 produces @xmath40 since then @xmath41 . at the node",
    "@xmath38 the situation is a little bit more subtle .",
    "the key point is that the function @xmath42 is generically nonzero at the node ( exceptions might possibly be non - analytical points of @xmath30 due to interaction singularities , which are , however , of zero measure ) . therefore taking the limit @xmath39 we get @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 diverges as @xmath46",
    ", therefore @xmath47 enforces vanishing of any wave function at the node @xmath38 . in this limit @xmath47",
    "become the fixed - node  potential \" that is more naturally understood as a boundary condition .",
    "the fixed - phase approximation is therefore more general than the fixed - node approximation .",
    "however , the accuracy of the method depends on the choice of the phase that nominally varies in the full configuration space unlike in the fixed - node condition that applies only on the nodal subspace that is @xmath48-dimensional for @xmath5 fermions in 3d space ( ie , its codimension is 1 ) .",
    "if we try to solve equation ( [ rho - eqn ] ) without modification , fluctuations in the weights due to the potentials will make the dmc implementation inefficient .",
    "we therefore apply an importance sampling transformation with a trial amplitude @xcite .",
    "if we denote @xmath49 , equation ( [ rho - eqn ] ) becomes @xmath50 \\\\+ \\left [ e_l(\\mathbf{r } ) - e_t \\right ] g(\\mathbf{r},\\tau ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have included also an energy offset @xmath51 .",
    "the importance sampling introduces two new terms , namely a drift velocity @xmath52 and the local energy @xmath53 \\rho_t(r)\\ ] ] for later purposes we can simplify the evolution equation by denoting the dynamical part of the operator acting on the function @xmath54 as @xmath55 so that we can write @xmath56 g(\\mathbf{r},\\tau)\\ ] ] one can find straightforward formulas for the drift , potential generated by the phase and local energy by using the gradient and laplacian of @xmath30 . clearly , we have @xmath57 which implies @xmath58 @xmath59 similarly for the laplacian we write @xmath60 = e^{i\\phi_t}\\nabla^2\\rho_t -\\rho_t e^{i\\phi_t}(\\nabla\\phi_t)^2\\\\ + 2i e^{i\\phi_t}(\\nabla\\rho_t\\cdot \\nabla \\phi_t)+ i\\rho_te^{i\\phi_t } ( \\nabla^2\\phi_t)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] so that the real contribution can be further arranged as @xmath61= \\rho_t(-1/2)\\nabla^2\\rho_t+ \\rho_t^2(1/2)(\\nabla\\phi_t)^2\\ ] ] where @xmath62 .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath61/\\rho_t^2= \\rho_t^{-1 } t_{kin}\\rho_t+ ( 1/2)(\\nabla\\phi_t)^2\\ ] ] and the local energy is then @xmath63/\\rho_t^2 + v\\ ] ] since gradient and laplacian of @xmath30 are routinely calculated in dmc , by using the above formulas the needed quantities can be evaluated straightforwardly .",
    "rewriting equation ( [ importance - sampling ] ) in integral form yields @xmath64 the green s function for this process is of the exact same form as the in fndmc , @xmath65 \\\\      \\times \\exp \\left [ -\\frac { \\tau}{2}(e_l(\\mathbf{r'})+e_l(\\mathbf{r})-2e_t)\\right]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] at this point , it is clear that the implementation of fpdmc proceeds in the exact same manner as fndmc .",
    "the main difference is that the mixed - distribution is made from the _ trial amplitude _ rather than the trial wave function .",
    "additionally , the local energy has an additional term from the trial phase .",
    "since both amplitudes in @xmath66 are positive - definite everywhere , any proposed move in the imaginary time evolution is accessible since there is no nodal surface ( any incidental zeros of @xmath67 are at most codimension 2 , ie , of zero measure , similarly to points in 3d space ) .",
    "the accuracy of this method clearly depends on the accuracy of the trial phase .",
    "if the trial phase happens to be the exact phase , then the projected solution will be @xmath68 producing the ground state energy while the convergence towards the exact value scales with the square of the difference between the exact and approximate trial function .",
    "in this section , we introduce the relativistic part of the hamiltonian for use in fpdmc . in  [ section : arep_and_so ] , we give a quick discussion of relativistic quantum mechanics in a 4-component formalism .",
    "we then discuss the reduction to a 2-component formalism with an effective hamiltonian .",
    "this effective hamiltonian approach uses pseudopotentials to replace the relativistic core - electrons with a suitable effective field for the valence electrons .",
    "we discuss the similarities and differences between the standard effective core potentials used in dmc . in ",
    "[ section : upperbound ] , we show that an upper bound can be obtained within the fixed - phase approximation for complex nonlocal operators like our spin - orbit hamiltonian .      for heavy atomic and molecular systems , bonding and spectral properties can not be accurately predicted without the inclusion of scalar - relativistic and spin - orbit effects @xcite . in a relativistic treatment , one must begin with the approximation for the relativistic hamiltonian @xcite , known as the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian , given as @xmath69 - \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n_e}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n_{ion}}\\frac{z_i}{r_{ii } } + \\sum\\limits_{i > j } \\frac{1}{r_{ij}}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are defined through the pauli matrices @xmath72 and identity @xmath73 , @xmath74 here we have ignored the breit interactions@xcite , which gives rise to higher order retardation effects such as spin - other orbit , dipole interactions between two spins , and fermi - contact interactions .",
    "this hamiltonian , to order @xmath75 , contains the dominant relativistic effects of the mass - velocity correction , the darwin contribution to the @xmath76 atomic level , and the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian in equation ( [ dirac_coulomb ] ) will be 4-component dirac spinors .",
    "these spinors can be decomposed into large and small 2-component spinors , @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "analysis of the individual @xmath77 and @xmath78 for all - electron systems indicate that @xmath78 is negligible in the valence region where chemical bonding is important @xcite . from this , to a reasonable approximation the valence electrons can be accurately described by 2-component spinors . since the relativistic effects are strongest in the core region , valence electrons can be treated nonrelativistically subject to an effective field that mimics the repulsion of the core electrons @xcite .",
    "this points to representing the relativistic effects on the valence electrons through an operator @xmath79 that leads to the following hamiltonian @xmath80 which contains only the valence electrons .",
    "the effective potential @xmath79 for an electron @xmath81 from a given ion is typically expanded in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the electron - ion distance . the effective operator @xmath79 contains all of the relativistic effects from the core region and allows one to only consider the valence electrons , as is typically done in nonrelativistic calculations @xcite .",
    "this is very important for the application in dmc , where for all - electron systems the computational demands scale with the atomic number @xmath84 as @xmath85 , but scales more favorably as @xmath86 when effective potentials remove the core electrons .",
    "therefore , relativistic qmc calculations can be done using the effective non - local pseudopotentials .",
    "the relativistic effective potential can be written in a different form that separates the relativistic effects into scalar relativistic and spin - orbit@xcite , namely @xmath87 .",
    "the operator is semi - local ; i.e. local in the relative distance to the nearest nucleus , but non - local in the solid angle for a given radius .",

    "this is easy to see by considering the matrix elements of the pseudopotential .",
    "if we denote the configuration space of space @xmath111 and spin @xmath112 coordinates @xmath113 the matrix element that enters the green s function after a trotter expansion can be written as @xmath114 the key problem lies with the matrix elements @xmath115 that , in general , can have a complicated sign structure and thus generate negative or complex values ; obviously , this is also true without the spin - orbit terms .",
    "the locality approximation eliminates this problem .",
    "however , it generates a bias that vanishes quadratically with the error in the trial wave function and it also does not guarantee the variational property with regard to the original hamiltonian@xcite .",

    "this proof enables us to be able to apply the t - moves technique @xcite in this more general setting . in the proof",
    "we will follow rather closely the original arguments @xcite that will be generalized at a few important points",

    "[ eqn : nonlocal_expansion ] in the importance sampling green s function .",
    "note that we can express the matrix elements of arbitrary hermitian operator as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is symmetric in @xmath120 and positive - definite .",
    "then @xmath121 as must be the case when @xmath116 is hermitian , i.e. , @xmath122 .",
    "we write the trial wave function as @xmath123 . denoting @xmath124 condition",

    "although @xmath129 and @xmath130 are anti - symmetric , @xmath131 is a symmetric function of @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "following @xcite , we construct an effective hamiltonian @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the _ sign - flip _ potential defined as @xmath136 we want to show that @xmath137 produces an upper bound for the original hamiltonian .",
    "we begin with any state with the _ same phase _ as the trial wave function , namely @xmath138 the discrepancy of @xmath137 and @xmath3 with this state is @xmath139 rewriting this in configuration space , we obtain @xmath140\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] rewriting this over the terms that generate sign - flips , we have @xmath141 denoting @xmath142 , we see that @xmath143\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 . if we simplify this expression once more , we see that @xmath145 becomes @xmath146 ^ 2}{h }    \\geq 0   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which is clearly positive everywhere , since the integration is over the region where @xmath147 is positive .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian produces an upper bound for @xmath3 and recovers the variational property .",
    "note that this point - that the approximation makes sense only in the fixed - node framework - has been emphasized in the original paper on the localization approximation @xcite .",
    "the upper bound can be recovered in this framework by implementation of the so - called @xmath148moves algorithm @xcite .",
    "note that even in this algorithm the fixed - node / phase condition is of key importance , the t - moves can recover only the best possible energy within the given constraint .",
    "we discuss how spins can be treated as a quantum variable . in ",
    "[ section : spinrep ] , we discuss our choice for a continuous and overcomplete representation of the spin variable .",
    "once we have a representation for the spin variable , we discuss the form of the one - particle spinors and trial wave functions which couple the spin and spatial degrees of freedom in  [ section : wf ] .",
    "we discuss the evaluation of the pseudopotential with this spin representation in  [ section : evalpp ] .",
    "lastly , we discuss our choice of sampling spin degrees of freedom and how this modifies the green s function in fpdmc in  [ section : spinsampling ] .",
    "let us denote one - particle spinors as @xmath149 where @xmath99 is the spin projection coordinate on the @xmath150axis .",
    "in its usual minimal representation the spin variable have discrete values @xmath151 so that for @xmath152 eigenstates @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "the evaluation of any expectation @xmath155 for a variational wave function @xmath156 includes spatial integrations as well as summation over @xmath157 spin configurations space of @xmath158 @xmath159 assuming we have @xmath5 fermions .",
    "this can be recast as sampling according to the positive density @xmath160 @xmath161    this expression can be implemented in the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) as one can simply add the sampling of the spin configurations to the discrete sampling of the spatial coordinates .",
    "however , generalization to projection methods is more complicated .",
    "note that any change of the discrete spin coordinate(s ) will lead to `` jumps '' in the stochastic path .",
    "these jumps can cause the local energy fluctuations to increase substantially and that could possibly compromise the utility and efficiency of the method . since we are employing a diffusion - drift sampling process in imaginary time with weights that include local energy in the exponential , any large fluctuations would make a reliable estimate of the expectations difficult to obtain , especially if we increase the system size .",
    "another strategy would be to sum over all of the spin configurations for every spatial step .",
    "however , this has an exponential scaling so that for large systems this is intractable .",
    "one possibility how to address this obstacle is to make the spin configuration space compact and continuous , which allows for smooth sampling @xcite .",
    "we can choose an _ overcomplete _ spin representation through the utilization of a 1d ring ( or @xmath162 ) lowest pair of degenerate eigenstates as follows : @xmath163 where the spin variable @xmath164 .",
    "this implies the normalization condition for two arbitrary spin states @xmath165    as the simplest illustration , consider an arbitrary one - electron spinor of the form @xmath166 .",
    "the expectation value of the @xmath167 $ ] operator with the spinor is clearly @xmath168 .",
    "if we now consider this expectation value in a vmc formulation , we have the following expectation value @xmath169 where @xmath170 and the local energy is @xmath171 . plugging in",
    ", this yields the expectation value @xmath172 as expected , where we sample the distribution @xmath173 and evaluate the average of the local energy .",
    "the introduced representation has several important consequences .",
    "first , it enables to define a continuous path for the evolving sampling points ( walkers ) and therefore all the associated quantities along the path are smooth by definition .",
    "second , the spin coordinate space that is introduced has some desireable properties , namely is it is compact and the interval @xmath174 can be sampled rapidly .",
    "the harmonic functions have minimal curvature and are complex so that no additional ( artificial ) node created , ie , so that the formulation fits the fixed - phase formulation .",
    "third , note that unlike discrete coordinates that switch - on and -off the up and down components of the spinor , the spin functions are always somewhere  in between \" due to the fact that they are weighted by complex values with unit modulus . in effect",
    ", they introduce a complex weighted spinors that for many - spins hedge the average effect of the spin summations .",
    "this will prove important at sampling the spin coordinates as explained below .      in fndmc calculations without spin terms in the hamiltonian",
    ", the electrons can be labeled as @xmath175 spin - up and @xmath176 spin - down ones and these labels remain static .",
    "this is due to the fact that spins commute with the hamiltonian , implying that both the total and individuals spins are conserved .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that expectation values can be then calculated using spatial only averaging with configuration space of @xmath177 .",
    "consequently , the trial wave functions are typically constructed as bipartitioned spin - up and -down slater determinant(s ) built from one - particle orbitals obtained from hartree - fock , post - hartree - fock or dft methods @xmath178      \\textrm{det}_m^{\\downarrow}\\left[\\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_l)\\right]\\ ] ]",
    "the particle correlations are explicitly approximated by the jastrow factor given as @xmath179 where we have one- , two- , and three - body terms ( @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively ) , that describe electron - ion , electron - electron , etc , correlations .    with our choice of spin representation in  [ section : spinrep ] , we have a wave function that lives in a configuration space @xmath182 .",
    "we write the trial wave function as @xmath183\\ ] ] where @xmath184 are one - particle spinors . in general , each spinor has different spatial dependence for the up and down spin components , namely @xmath185 each spatial function @xmath186 is expanded in appropriate basis functions ( for example , gaussian type orbitals or plane waves ) . with regards to the jastrow factor , we use the same form as described above .",
    "seemingly , every electron should be treated as having the `` same '' spin since there is only _",
    "one _ determinant of spinors , rather than the spin - like and spin - unlike distinction in jastrow forms employed in conventional calculations .",
    "this would imply that the cusp should correspond to the like - spin value since the determinant vanishes at the two - electron coincidence point .",
    "however , spatial coincidence configurations are of zero measure with regard to coincidence at the full space - spin configurations space .",
    "clearly , the differences in spin coordinates make the determinant , in general , nonvanishing even when the spatial coordinates of two electrons coincide .",
    "therefore the more appropriate is the unlike spins cusp condition @xcite @xmath187 we also note that the precise cusp value has only a marginal impact on the results since it really affects only a very small part of the configuration space .",
    "much more substantial effect comes from the shape of the jastrow correlations for @xmath188 bohr , namely , at medium- and long - range distances .",
    "these are the ranges of distances where correlations affect one- and two - electron pair densities very significantly over a sizable part of the configuration space .",
    "the accuracy in these regions has then important consequences for both minimization of energy fluctutations as well as for accurate projections and minimization of the localization bias .    in the limit of vanishing spin - orbit interaction",
    "the single - reference spinor determinant ( regardless of the chosen representation ) should simplify to the product of spin - up and -down determinants .",
    "this is true also for our trial wave function .",
    "let us consider @xmath5 occupied spinors that can be grouped as as @xmath189 kramer s pairs ( for simplicity assuming @xmath5 to be even ) .",
    "we can write the kramer s pair as @xmath190 where the @xmath191 is the spin - orbit induced splitting of the spatial orbital @xmath192 .",
    "we sketch a block of the first four rows from the corresponding slater determinant as given by @xmath193.\\ ] ] let all the spin variables @xmath194 have distinct values and the spin orbit splitting @xmath195 . after some linear rearragements we can write the matrix as sketched for the first four rows @xmath196\\ ] ] up to a common complex prefactor . after reshuffling rows and columns ,",
    "the single determinant of spinors factorizes into the product of two determinants with spin - up and -down particles .",
    "generalization to odd @xmath5 with un unpaired spinor is straightforward .    for the sake of completeness we note that the simplest trial function based on a _ pair spinor _ orbital @xmath197 written as an antisymmetrized product of distinct pairs of particles results in a pfaffian @xmath198\\exp[u({\\bf r})].\\ ] ] obviously , the pair orbital itself is antisymmetric since the pfaffian is defined for a skew - symmetric matrix so that @xmath199 , as explained previously @xcite .",
    "note also that for odd number of electrons the skew symmetric matrix can be expanded by an unpaired row and column with an unpaired spinor so that the resulting matrix is of even dimension .",
    "therefore systems with odd number of electrons can be described by the corresponding pfaffian @xcite as well ( without boosting the matrix by another row and column the pfaffian of matrix with odd dimensions would vanishes identically ) .",
