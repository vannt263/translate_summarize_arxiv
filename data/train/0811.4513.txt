    "quantum graphs are laplace or schrdinger operators on metric graphs .",
    "as structures intermediate between discrete and continuum objects they have received quite some attention in recent years in mathematics , physics and material sciences , see e.g. the recent proceeding volume  @xcite for an overview .    here , we study periodic and random quantum graphs .",
    "our results concern spectral properties which are related to the integrated density of states ( ids ) , sometimes called spectral distribution function . as in the case of random schrdinger operators in euclidean space , disorder may enter the operator via the potential .",
    "moreover , and this is specific to quantum graphs , randomness may also influence the characteristic geometric ingredients determining the operator , viz .    *",
    "the lengths of the edges of the metric graph and * the vertex conditions at each junction between the edges .    in the present paper",
    "we pay special attention to randomness in these geometric data .",
    "our results may be summarised as follows . for quite wide classes of quantum graphs",
    "we establish    * the existence , respectively the convergence in the macroscopic limit , of the integrated density of states under suitable ergodicity and amenability conditions ( see theorem  [ thm : ids ] ) , * a trace per unit volume formula for the ids ( see equation  ) , * a wegner estimate for random edge length models ( assuming independence and smoothness for the disorder ) ( theorem  [ thm : wegner ] ) .",
    "this implies quantitative continuity estimates for the ids ( corollary  [ cor : wegner ] ) .",
    "these abstract results are illustrated by the thorough discussion of an example concerning a combinatorial and a metric graph based on the kagome lattice . in this case",
    "we calculate positions and sizes of all jumps of the ids .",
    "our results show the effect of smoothing of the ids via randomness .",
    "the article is organised as follows : in the remainder of this section we summarise the origin of results about the construction of the ids and of wegner estimates and point out aspects of the proofs which are different in the case of quantum graphs in comparison to random schrdinger operators on @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "we mention briefly recent results about spectral properties of random quantum graphs which are in some sense complementary to ours . finally , we point out some open problems in this field of research . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the random length model and state the main results . in section  [ sec : example ] we present the kagome lattice example . in section  [ sec : approx ] we prove theorem  [ thm : ids ] concerning the approximability of the ids .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : wegner ] we prove the wegner estimate theorem  [ thm : wegner ] .    intuitively , the ids concerns the number of quantum states per unit volume below a prescribed energy . from the physics point of view",
    "the natural definition of this quantity is via a macroscopic limit .",
    "this amounts to approximating the ( ensemble - averaged ) spectral distribution function of an operator on the whole space by normalised eigenvalue counting functions associated to finite - volume restrictions of the operator . for ergodic random and almost - periodic operators in euclidean space",
    "this approach has been implemented rigorously in  @xcite , and developed further in a number of papers , among them  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "all these operators were stationary and ergodic with respect to a commutative group of translations . for graphs and manifolds beyond euclidean space",
    "the relevant group is in general no longer abelian .",
    "the first result establishing the approximability of the ids of a periodic schrdinger operator on a manifold was  @xcite .",
    "an important assumption on the underlying geometry is amenability .",
    "analogous results on transitive graphs have been established e.g.  in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "for schrdinger operators with a random potential on a manifold with an amenable covering group the existence of the ids was established in @xcite , and for laplace - beltrami operators with random metrics in  @xcite .",
    "for analogous results for discrete operators on amenable graphs see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient of the proofs of the above results is the amenable ergodic theorem of  @xcite .",
    "more recenty , the question of approximation of the ids uniformly with respect to the energy variable has been pursued , see for instance  @xcite and the references therein .    independently of the approximability by finite volume eigenvalue counting functions it is possible to give an abstract definition of the ids by an averaged trace per unit volume formula ,",
    "see  @xcite . in the amenable",
    "setting , both definitions of the ids coincide .    for a certain class of metric graphs",
    "the approximability of the ids has been established before . in",
    "@xcite this has been carried out for random metric graphs with an @xmath2 structure .",
    "a step of the proof which is specific to the setting of quantum graphs concerns the influence of finite rank perturbations on eigenvalue counting functions .",
    "when one considers laplacians on manifolds , one would rather use the principle of not feeling the boundary of heat kernels , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , to derive the analogous step of the proof .",
    "next we discuss the literature on wegner estimates and on the regularity of the ids .",
    "wegner gave in  @xcite convincing arguments for the lipschitz continuity of the ids of the discrete anderson model on @xmath1 .",
    "the proof is based on an estimate for the expected number of eigenvalues in a finite energy interval of a restricted box hamiltonian .",
    "a rigorous proof of the latter estimate was given in  @xcite ( for the analogous alloy - type model on @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , the bound of  @xcite was not sufficient to establish the lipschitz continuity of the ids",
    ". in  @xcite tools to prove hlder continuity were supplied , see also  @xcite .",
    "they concern bounds on the spectral shift function . up to now the most widely applicable result concerning the lipschitz - continuity of the ids",
    "is given in  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to derive lipschitz continuity of the ids goes via spectral averaging of resolvents , see  @xcite .",
    "however , this method requires more assumptions on the underlying model .",
    "wegner s estimate and all references mentioned so far concern the case where the random variables couple to a perturbation which is a non - negative operator .",
    "if this is not the case , additional ideas are necessary to obtain the desired bounds , see  @xcite . in our situation , where the perturbation concerns the metric of the underlying space , the dependence on the random variables is not monotone .",
    "this is also the case for random metrics on manifolds studied in  @xcite . to deal with non - monotonicity",
    ", the proof of the wegner estimate ( theorem [ thm : wegner ] ) takes up an idea developed in  @xcite , which is not unrelated to  @xcite .",
    "the relevant formula used in the proof is .",
    "we need also a partial integration formula whose usefulness was first seen in  @xcite .    in the context of quantum graphs",
    "it is not necessary to rely on sophisticated estimates on the spectral shift function .",
    "it is sufficient to adapt a finite rank perturbation bound , which was used in  @xcite for the analysis of one - dimensional random schrdinger operators .",
    "these estimates are closely related to the finite rank estimates mentioned earlier in the context of the approximability of the ids . for schrdinger operators on metric graphs where the randomness enters via the potential ,",
    "wegner estimates have been proved in  @xcite . in the recent preprint  @xcite a wegner estimate for a model with @xmath2-structure and",
    "random edge lengths has been established .",
    "the proof is based on different methods than we use in the present paper .",
    "next we want to explain an application of wegner estimates apart from the continuity of the ids .",
    "it concerns the phenomenon of localisation of waves in random media .",
    "more precisely , for certain types of random schrdinger operators on @xmath1 and on @xmath0 it is well known that in certain energy intervals near spectral boundaries the spectrum is pure point .",
    "there are two basic methods to establish this fact ( apart form the one - dimensional situation where specific methods apply ) .",
    "the first one is called multiscale analysis and was invented in  @xcite .",
    "the second approach from @xcite is called fractional moment method or aizenman - molchanov method . a certain step of the localisation proof via multiscale analysis concerns the control of spectral resonances of finite box hamiltonians . a possibility to achieve this control",
    "is the use of a wegner estimate .",
    "in fact , the wegner estimates needed for this purpose are much weaker than those necessary to establish regularity of the ids .",
    "this has been discussed in the context of random quantum graphs in section 3.2 of  @xcite .",
    "recently localisation has been proven for several types of random quantum graphs . in  @xcite",
    "this has been done for models with @xmath2-structure , while  @xcite considers operators on tree - graphs . on the other hand , delocalisation ,",
    "i.e.  existence of absolutely continuous spectrum , for quantum graph models on trees has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "this result should be seen in the context of earlier , similar results for combinatorial tree graphs  @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss some open questions concerning random quantum graph models .",
    "as for models on @xmath1 , proofs of localisation require that the random variables entering the operators should have a regular distribution .",
    "in particular , if the law of the variables is a bernoulli measure , no known proof of localisation applies .",
    "this is different for random schrdinger operators @xmath0 . using a quantitative version of the unique continuation principle for solutions of schrdinger equations ,",
    "localisation was established in  @xcite for certain models with bernoulli disorder .",
    "the proof does not carry over to the analogous model on @xmath1 , since there is no appropriate version of the unique continuation principle available . for random quantum graphs",
    "the situation is even worse , since they exhibit in great generality compactly supported eigenfunctions , even if the underlying graph is @xmath2 .    like for random , ergodic schrdinger operators on @xmath1 and on @xmath0 there is no proof of delocalisation for random quantum graphs with @xmath2 structure . in the above",
    "mentioned papers on delocalisation it was essential that the underlying graph is a tree .",
    "an even harder question concerns the mobility edge .",
    "based on physical reasoning one expects that localised point spectrum and delocalised absolutely continuous spectrum should be separated in disjoint intervals by mobility edges . in the context of random operators where the disorder enters via the geometry",
    "this leads to an intriguing question pointed out already in  @xcite .",
    "if one considers a graph over @xmath2 which is diluted by a percolation process , the laplacian on the resulting combinatorial or metric graph has a discontinuous ids .",
    "in fact , the set of jumps can be characterised rather explicitely and is dense in the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "now the question is , where the eigenvalues of these strongly localised states repell in some manner absolutely continuous spectrum ( if it exists at all ) .    for the interested reader we provide here references to textbook accounts of the issues discussed above .",
    "they concern the more classical models on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , rather than quantum graphs . in  @xcite one can find a detailed discussion and proofs of the approximability of the ids by its finite volume analogues and of wegner estimates .",
    "the survey article @xcite is devoted to the ids in general , while the multiscale proof of localisation is exposed in the monograph @xcite .",
    "the theory of random schrdinger operators is presented from a broader perspective in the books @xcite and in the summer school notes  @xcite .",

    "np and op also acknowledge the financial support of the technical university chemnitz .",
