    "while spin and charge degrees of freedom are manifestly decoupled , they might cooperate in surprising ways giving rise to novel many body states that are yet to be understood . in this paper , we present one such surprise , namely a nagaoka state@xcite nurturing a @xmath3 superconductivity in @xmath4d honeycomb lattice infinite-@xmath2 hubbard model at small but finite doping(its noninteracting counterpart is described by dirac pockets ) , at the expense of only a tiny reduction of its own saturated ferromagnetism .    at exact half filling ,",
    "all low energy states are exhausted by the 2@xmath5(@xmath6 is the total number of sites ) fold degenerate ground states generated by the localized free ( dangling ) spin - half moments .",
    "spins have no dynamics of their own . upon doping ,",
    "holes hop and scramble spin configurations .",
    "in general , coherent delocalization of charges becomes difficult and kinetic energy gets frustrated , except when we have saturated ferromagnetism and a simple fermi sea as a ground state .",
    "while coherent delocalization of charges occurs through bloch state formation , pauli principle increases the kinetic energy , because only up spin bands are used .",
    "however , the real question is , are there other organizations of charge and spin degrees of freedom that reduce kinetic energy frustration and beat the nagaoka state ?",
    "there are conflicting results for the stability of nagaoka state in square lattice infinite-@xmath2 hubbard model at small hole doping .",
    "an analysis by wen and doucot indicates@xcite that even for 2-holes the ground state is not fully spin polarized .",
    "there is also an argument given by trugman@xcite that in any finite system the lowest energy state can not have bound holes .",
    "series expansion results also cast doubt on stability of nagaoka ferromagnet at any finite doping@xcite .",

    "finally , we provide a more straightforward way to understand the origin of charge - current and fm skyrmion(vortex ) current coupling in the infinite-@xmath2 hubbard model .",
