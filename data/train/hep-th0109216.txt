    "the higgs mass problem of the standard model ( sm ) includes ( @xmath3 ) the quadratic divergence of the higgs mass squared and ( @xmath4 ) the quartic divergence of vacuum energy density , which render power law sensitivities to the unknown ultraviolet physics .",
    "supersymmetry in 4 dimensional(4d ) spacetime has been thought as a possible solution of this hierarchy problem .",
    "recently , however , extra dimensional scenarios have been suggested as alternative solutions of the gauge hierarchy problem with the idea that the sm particles are confined to a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime@xcite .    in particular ,",
    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) i model@xcite with two 3-branes embedded in a slice of @xmath5 , the gauge hierarchy problem can be solved by taking the brane at the weak scale(tev brane ) as the visible brane through the warp factor decreasing away from the hidden brane(planck brane ) . as a result ,",
    "the stability of the gauge hierarchy becomes the mechanism of radius stabilization at appropriate separation of the planck and tev branes@xcite . on the other hand , the rs ii model@xcite can not serve as a solution of the gauge hierarchy problem , but presumably renders a more important paradigm toward an alternative to compactification with a single 3-brane embedded in noncompact @xmath5 .",
    "it is based on the fact that the linearized einstein gravity can be reproduced on the brane even for the noncompact extra dimension of the rs ii model@xcite . even with these interesting results of the rs models ,",
    "the notorious cosmological constant problem is not solved , but recast only into fine - tunings between brane and bulk cosmological constants@xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that it is possible to have a flat solution without fine - tunings of input parameters in the rs ii model with the addition of the bulk three form field@xcite , signaling a possible existence of the solution of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "one more thing to note is that in the rs i model the tev brane takes a negative tension while the planck brane takes a positive tension , which introduced some cosmological difficulties toward a smooth transition to the standard big bang cosmology@xcite .",
    "this cosmological problem in the rs i model can be solved by taking into account the radius stabilization@xcite .",
    "but it is worthwhile to search for models with the visible brane taking a positive tension or branes taking positive tensions only .    in this context , when the higher curvature term is included as a gauss - bonnet invariant in the rs i model , one can find that there exists another flat solution of the rs type under the condition that the visible brane should have a positive tension@xcite .",
    "however , it is necessary to deal with both the einstein - hilbert term and the gauss - bonnet term on the equal footing , but not the gauss - bonnet term as being subdominant compared to the einstein - hilbert term .",
    "other investigations of the higher curvature gravity concentrated mainly on the gauss - bonnet term in the brane background can be also found in the literature@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", we can find more diverse possibilities in higher dimensional extensions of the rs model@xcite .",
    "in fact , in dimensions higher than @xmath6 the intersecting brane worlds were considered as a direct generalization of the rs models@xcite , but the visible universe does not have a nonzero brane tension , just regarded as the location where branes with lower codimensions intersect .",

    "thus , it is of interest to consider @xmath1 orbifold compactification in 6d with negative bulk cosmological constant , in the hope of obtaining a more general string compactification in the future .",
    "already , there exists an example that all the sm matter fields are located at the orbifold fixed points@xcite , the kind of which can be generalized to the rs i type models .    in this paper ,",
    "therefore , we extend the orbifold symmetry of the brane junction in @xmath0 to the @xmath1 case . then , we also consider a six - dimensional compactification on another orbifold @xmath2 . in that case , there exist three fixed points where reside 3-branes corresponding to centers of the @xmath12 symmetric brane junctions .",
    "we show that the 3-brane tensions at these fixed points are all positive for the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath13 .",
    "then , we can explain the mass hierarchy by regarding two 3-branes , apart from the 3-brane at the origin , as the visible brane .",
