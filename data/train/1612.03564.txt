    "the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation are powerful cosmological observables to understand the physics of the early universe . during the past decades",
    ", much effort has been made to characterize the cmb , including three satellite generations : the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) , the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and planck .",
    "these experiments were mainly devoted to measure the cmb temperature anisotropies , precisely mapping these tiny fluctuations in the sky @xcite . however , according to the standard cosmological model , the full information of cmb is encoded in the statistical properties of both temperature , @xmath4 , and the linear polarizations , described by the stocks parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are defined with respect to a fixed coordinate system in the sky , and depend on the choice of coordinate system .",
    "it is then convenient to decompose the linear polarization into the curl - free ( @xmath1-mode ) and divergence - free ( @xmath0-mode ) components since they have the advantage of being rotationally invariant @xcite .",
    "recent results from the planck satellite also show precise measurements of the @xmath1-mode field @xcite . in the standard cosmological model ,",
    "both cmb temperature and @xmath1-mode anisotropies are mainly generated by the primordial density perturbations .",
    "in addition , the auto - correlation power spectra @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the cross - correlation power spectrum @xmath9 sensitively depend on the cosmological parameters and cosmological models .",
    "thus , the observations of wmap and planck satellites on these spectra have tightly constrained most cosmological parameters and inflationary parameters .",
    "however , the @xmath0-mode polarization encodes quite different cosmological information : in the large scales , the @xmath0-mode polarization is supported to be generated by the primordial gravitational waves @xcite , which is the smoking - gun evidence of inflation @xcite . in the small scales , the @xmath0-mode is mainly produced by the deflection of the cmb photons by cluster of galaxies during their travel between the last scattering surface and the observer , known as the cmb lensing @xcite . during the past few years , many ground - based experiments were designed to measure the @xmath0-mode polarization signal , such as sptpol @xcite , polarbear @xcite , actpol @xcite , bicep2 and keck array @xcite .",
    "these experiments , including the planck satellite @xcite , have detected the lensed @xmath0-mode signal in the high multipole range at the high confidence level .",
    "thus , the detection of the primordial @xmath0-mode signal is then the main goal of future cmb experiments @xcite . among them",
    "we can cite bicep3 , advact , class , simons array , spt-3 g , c - bass , quijote , ebex , qubic , quiet , piper , spider , lspe , et al .",
    "@xcite as ground - based experiments , and litebird @xcite , cmbpol @xcite , core @xcite , prism @xcite , pixie @xcite as the next satellite generation of cmb experiments .    in the real observations ,",
    "the detection of cosmological @xmath0-mode is limited by various contaminations , including instrumental noises , instrumental systematical errors @xcite , as well as the polarized foregrounds @xcite .",
    "another source of contamination is the so - called @xmath1-@xmath0 mixture , which arises from an incomplete sky analysis of the cmb polarization signals @xcite .",
    "our ability to decompose cmb polarization signal in a partial sky coverage is crucial , since even for satellite missions the presence of non - cosmological contaminations must be masked out .",
    "so , this mixture exists in all the cmb polarization analysis , and could become the dominant contamination for the detection of primordial gravitational waves @xcite . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "numerous practical methods have been developed to separate the @xmath1-mode and @xmath0-mode in the partial sky @xcite .",
    "however , most of these methods suffer from one or several of the following drawbacks - they are slow in practice , they are difficult to realize in pixel space , and/or they lead to partial information loss .",
    "for instance , the method suggested by bunn et al .",
    "( this method is adopted by bicep2/keck array collaboration @xcite ) involves constructing an eigenbasis , and it has a high computational cost @xcite . among all these methods ,",
    "the methods proposed in @xcite are based on a common algebraic framework of the so - called @xmath10-fields .",
    "therefore , they are fast and can be efficiently applied to high resolution maps due to the use of a fast spherical harmonics transformation . however , it is important to mention that the residual of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage is unavoidable even if the proper method is applied in the data analysis @xcite . in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "the authors carefully compared these three methods , and they found that although all of them allow a significant reduction of the level of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage , the method of smith @xcite ensures the smallest error bars in all experimental configurations and leads to the smallest leakage residuals .",
    "for these reasons , in the present article , we shall focus on this method due to our limited computational resources , and study the influence of residuals of @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage on the cmb @xmath0-mode polarization .",
    "in most previous works @xcite , the authors focused only on the power spectrum of the @xmath0-type polarization and that the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage is tiny in the smith s @xmath1/@xmath0 decomposition method .",
    "however , the @xmath0-mode is a highly non - gaussian field due to the different kind of components in the observed maps .",
    "thus , in addition to the power spectrum , various non - gaussian statistical tools are also helpful to separate the different components and/or constrain the cosmological parameters . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we have applied the minkowski functionals ( mfs ) to quantify the deviation from gaussianity of @xmath0-mode maps , and studied the effects of instrumental noises , the cmb mask , and the influence of foreground residuals . as an extension of this work , in the present paper , by applying a similar analysis",
    "we will focus on characterizing the imprint of the @xmath1-@xmath0 mixture residual in the lensed @xmath0-mode map .",
    "as well known , mfs characterize the morphological properties of convex , compact sets in an @xmath11-dimensional space @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage has completely different morphological properties from the stochastic @xmath0-mode generated by cosmological sources .",
    "we expect the influence of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage to be significant in the mfs analysis , even if the amplitude of this leakage is small . as the a complementary analysis ,",
    "in this paper we shall also apply other statistical tools , including the betti numbers , skewness and kurtosis , to investigate the imprints of @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage . throughout this paper , in order to focus on the effect of @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage residuals , we shall consider the case with only cosmic variance and ignore the effects of the other @xmath0-mode sources , including the instrumental noises and foregrounds , which have been detail studied in the previous work @xcite .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in sec .",
    "[ @xmath1- and @xmath0-mode polarization of cmb ] we briefly introduce the theory of cmb polarization . in sec .",
    "[ @xmath1- and @xmath0-mode decomposition in partial sky ] , we derive the equations needed to obtain the @xmath1/@xmath0 decomposition in a partial sky analysis .",
    "[ minkowski functionals as the statistic ] is divided in 3 subsections : sec .",

    "[ other statistics ] , we use other statistics in the analysis for completeness , being the betti numbers described in sec . [ betti numbers ] , and both skewness and kurtosis explained in sec .",
    "[ skewness and kurtosis ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in the same way as the temperature field , we can define the @xmath18 and @xmath19 polarization sky maps in terms of spherical harmonics ,    @xmath20    the power spectra can then be written as @xmath21 where the brackets denote the average over all realizations . for a gaussian field ,",
    "all the statistical properties can be obtained by analyzing the second - order power spectra .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that here we are dealing with a highly non - gaussian lensed @xmath0-map due to the contribution of cmb lensing to the final map @xcite . in this case ,",
    "different statistics , as , for example , the mfs , are necessary to describe the field .",
    "moreover , we notice that the @xmath1/@xmath0 decomposition in a full sky analysis is straightforward , providing a direct link to the primordial cosmological perturbations , especially the gws imprint on the cmb @xmath0-mode polarization . nevertheless , we know that galactic foregrounds are present even in full sky surveys , and they should be masked to reduce the contaminations .",
    "so , in the realistic case , we must derive the @xmath1-type and @xmath0-type maps from the incomplete @xmath12 and @xmath13 observables .",
    "if the polarization fields are not measured in full sky , but on a fraction only , eqs.([eq_elm ] ) can not be derived directly .",
    "so , the separation of pure @xmath1- and @xmath0-mode from the observed @xmath12 and @xmath13 maps is not trivial , due to the existence of ambiguous mode @xcite , which can be successfully avoided by different ways @xcite . as mentioned above , in this paper ,",
    "we adopt the method suggested in @xcite , which is based on the algebraic framework of the so - called @xmath10-field ( denoted as @xmath3-field in the present paper ) .    for the full - sky observations , according to @xcite",
    ", we can define a new set of fields @xmath22 and @xmath3 from the polarization fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 as follows : @xmath23 , \\\\",
    "\\label{pseudo_b } \\mathcal{b}(\\hat{n } ) = -\\frac{1}{2i}[\\bar{\\eth}\\bar{\\eth}p_{+}(\\hat{n } ) - \\eth \\eth p_{-}(\\hat{n})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 corresponds to the spin - raising ( lowering ) operator for an arbitrary function @xmath25 with spin @xmath26 , @xmath27 from the definition , we know that the new map @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ pseudo_e ] ) is the standard scalar field , and @xmath3 in ( [ pseudo_b ] ) is the pseudo - scalar field in the two - dimensional sphere .",
    "thus , they can be expanded in the spherical harmonics as follows , @xmath28 where the expanding coefficients are @xmath29 these coefficients are related to the regular multipoles @xmath30 and @xmath31 by @xmath32 where we have @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding power spectra are then obtained as @xmath34    considering the mask window function @xmath35 , the masked @xmath0-type polarization map becomes @xmath36 , and the pseudo multipole coefficients can be defined as follows @xcite , @xmath37 so , the pure @xmath0-type map @xmath36 and the coefficient set @xmath38 are mathematically equivalent by definition . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we have developed to method to directly construct the pure map @xmath36 from the masked observables @xmath12 and @xmath13 . while in the method @xcite",
    ", we should first construct the pure coefficients @xmath38 and then translate them into the map @xmath36 .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that in both methods , it is impossible to construct the pure @xmath0-maps directly . in this paper , we shall adopt the latter method , which is briefly reviewed as follows .    in this method ,",
    "the concept of pure pseudo - multipoles is put forward and defined as , @xmath39^\\ast - p_{-}(\\hat n)\\left [ { \\eth } { \\eth}\\left(w(\\hat{n})y_{\\ell m}(\\hat{n})\\right)\\right]^\\ast \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be proved that this definition is equivalent to the eq .",
    "( [ pseudo_blm ] ) @xcite , which shows that in principle the pure pseudo - multipole method can successfully extract the pure @xmath0-type polarization signal and avoid the @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing part . to calculate the expression of eq .",
    "( [ pureb ] ) , we use the property of spin raising and lowering operators and obtain that @xcite @xmath40}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is used in the following calculations .",
    "note that , in this method , the first and second derivatives of the window function @xmath41 are used .",
    "if we adopt the top - hat window function , these derivatives diverge in the numerical computations .",
    "so , in practice , we should properly smooth the window function to avoid the divergence at the observed patch boundaries .",
    "thus , an appropriate sky apodization will play an important role in suppressing the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we carefully compare the leakage residual and the information loss for different smoothing methods , and found that the gaussian smoothing method presented by @xcite induces the smallest leakage in the final @xmath0-map .",
    ", which is dependent of the multipole @xmath42",
    ". however , different from them , in this paper we shall only focus on the statistical properties of the constructed @xmath3-map .",
    "so , we choose the window function for different aim , which should minimize the @xmath1-@xmath0 leakage and reduce the information loss . ]",
    "the gaussian smoothing kernel used to smooth the edges of @xmath41 is defined as @xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 denotes the full width at half maximum of the smoothing kernel .",
    "@xmath46 the smallest angular distance between the @xmath47-th observed pixel and the boundary of the mask .",
    "@xmath48 is an adjustable parameter referred as the apodization length .",

    "here we should mention that performing a spherical harmonic transformation of the foreground mask and its later reconstruction by inverse transformation leads to an oscillation pattern around jump discontinuities ( i.e. the reconstructed mask has non - zero values where they were originally zero ) , called the gibbs phenomenon .",
    "the discrepancy between the original mask and the reconstructed one must be corrected by choosing a window function in which multipoles higher than the truncation point are suppressed .",
    "the mfs describe the morphological properties of convex , compact sets in an @xmath11-dimensional space .",
    "they provide a powerful statistical tool that can also be used in partial sky maps , detecting non - gaussianities without previous knowledge of their intensity or angular dependence @xcite . on a two - dimensional cmb field defined on the sphere , @xmath54",
    ", the morphological properties of the data can be characterized as a linear combination of three mfs : the area , contour length and integrated geodetic curvature of an excursion set ( the latter also known as the difference between the numbers of hot and cold spots)@xcite . for a pixelized cmb sphere , an excursion set is given by the number of pixels in which the temperature exceeds the threshold @xmath55 .",
    "for a given threshold @xmath55 , it is convenient to define the excursion set @xmath56 and its boundary @xmath57 of a smooth scalar field @xmath58 as follows , @xmath59    thus , the area @xmath60 , the contour length @xmath61 and the integrated geodetic curvature @xmath62 , can be written as @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the surface element of @xmath54 and the line element along @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the geodetic curvature is represented by @xmath67 .",
    "the mfs can be numerically calculated for a given pixelized map @xmath68 as follows @xcite :    @xmath69    in eq .",

    "we used the algorithm developed by @xcite and @xcite for calculating the mfs .",
    "first , we generate two groups of monte carlo simulations containing 500 full - sky @xmath12 and @xmath13 lensed maps each .",

    "as mentioned above , in the numerical calculations , the numerical errors caused by the high multipoles are quite significant for two reasons : first , the errors caused by the gibbs phenomenon is dominant by the high multipoles @xcite ; second , the @xmath86 power spectrum is quite tilde blue , and the high multipoles dominate the numerical errors in the healpix - based computations @xcite . similar to the previous works @xcite , in order to smooth the high multipoles , we apply a gaussian smoothing with the parameter full width half maximum @xmath87 .",

    ", we derive the coefficients @xmath31 from the full - sky @xmath12 and @xmath13 maps , and translate them to the corresponding @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we can construct the full - sky @xmath3-maps by the standard route .",

    "however , the maps derived from the ideal case are free from it @xcite .",
    "so , the difference between these two kinds of @xmath3-maps reflect the imprints of residual @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage , which is the main goal of this article .",
    "to realize it , we do our analysis by the following steps :    * _ real case _ : first , we obtain the @xmath1/@xmath0 decomposition from partial @xmath12 and @xmath13 lensed sky maps as numerically described in @xcite . for each of the derived @xmath91-map , we can define the pseudo power spectrum as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "[ ps ] , we plot the average power spectra @xmath94 for the model with @xmath77 and @xmath78 with solid black and blue lines , respectively . as mentioned above ,",
    "these power spectra include two parts : one is the cmb @xmath0-type polarization , the other is the residual @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage . in order to show the contribution of the residual leakage",
    ", we do the exact same analysis to the model with @xmath77 and no cmb lensing ( i.e. no cmb @xmath0-mode ) .",
    "thus , the derived @xmath91-maps only include the residual @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage . from fig .",
    "[ mask_leakage ] , we find that the residuals are quite significant around the two poles and two belts at @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which are caused by the structure of the healpix package .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum is also present in fig .",
    "[ ps ] ( blue line ) , which is much smaller than the spectra including cmb signals , in particular in the low - multipole range .",
    "however , in the high - multipole range , the residuals become more and more important , and dominate the power spectrum at @xmath97 , which is consistent with the previous works @xcite . *",
    "second , it is well known that the calculation of the mfs requires smoothing the maps to be analyzed in order to remove the contribution of multipoles dominated by noise .",
    "even though different smoothing scales of the same cmb map have a high correlation , they must be taken into account in order to extract all its available statistical information .",
    "this is based on the fact that for each smoothing scale , the information of the cmb is dominant in a different multipole range @xcite .",

    "a number of practical methods have been developed for the @xmath1/@xmath0 decomposition in the incomplete sky surveys . in this paper , we adopted the method suggested by smith et al .",
    ", which ensures the small error bars in all experimental configurations and leads to the smallest leakage residuals .",
    "in addition , this method is based on the algebraic framework of @xmath10-field , which avoids the high computational cost and can be easily applied to the high resolution cmb maps . however , even if this separation method is used , the residual of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage is left in the constructed @xmath3-maps . in the present article , we employed the mfs , betti numbers , skewness and kurtosis statistics to study the morphological imprint of the leakage in the @xmath3-mode polarization maps .",
    "we compared the ideal case , in which the @xmath3-maps were generated from full - sky @xmath12 and @xmath13 observables , and the real case , where we generated the @xmath3-maps after applying the smoothed planck polarization mask ut78 to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 sky by means of the smith method described in @xcite .",
    "different from the real case , the ideal case is free from the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage residual caused by the @xmath1/@xmath0 separations .",
    "so , the difference between these two cases reflects the imprint of @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage .",
    "first , we compare the power spectra of @xmath3-mode polarization maps in these two cases , and found that they are nearly same , in particular in the low - multipole range , and the contribution of @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage is tiny .",
    "second , we did not find any imprint of the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage in the simulated @xmath3-maps when considering both skewness and kurtosis statistics , which shows that these one - point statistics are not sensitive to the leakage .",
    "these results confirm the effectiveness of the @xmath1/@xmath0 separation method .",
    "however , by comparing the mfs and betti numbers applied to the @xmath3-mode maps generated in the ideal and real cases , we find that the effect of leakage residuals decreases quickly with the increasing of @xmath98 , which significantly shows that the residuals are dominant by the higher multipoles .",
    "this result is consistent with the one derived from the power spectrum analysis .",
    "in addition , we also found that the leakage can not be ignored when combining the results of all the smoothing scales , @xmath98 , in both models , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . considering individual smoothing scales",
    "leads to the mistaken conclusion that the significance of the leakage is small and that it can be safely neglected .",
    "it is then important to point out that the large correlation of the mfs for different smoothing scales is expected since the leakage is not randomly distributed in the sky .",
    "the @xmath1-to-@xmath0 leakage plays an important role in the final @xmath3-map and must be taken into account to avoid misinterpretation of the data .",
