    "at present we have three scattering theories :    1 .",
    "theory of spherical harmonics ( sht ) used for elastic scattering ( see , for example  @xcite ) ; 2 .",
    "more general theory of van hove correlation functions , which we call standard scattering theory ( sst ) ( see , for example  @xcite ) ; 3 .   the fundamental scattering theory ( fst ) ( see , for example  @xcite ) , which is used mainly for justification of sst .",
    "the first one is inconsistent , the second one is not a theory but only a set of rules for calculation of cross sections , and the third one contains an error , so it does not justify sst .",
    "the error is hidden in definition of scattering probability .",
    "it relates initial wave packet of the incident neutron to outgoing plane wave of the scattered neutron .",
    "such a definition completely violates unitarity .",
    "the unitarity is conserved when both initial and final particles are plane waves or wave packet , but in both cases fst gives not cross sections but only probabilities .",
    "we applied the fundamental theory of plane waves scattering ( fpwst ) ( without generally used artificial finite volume @xmath0 ) to neutron scattering in monatomic gas , and found that the result is ambiguous , which is very easily checked .",
    "the probability amplitude @xmath1 of the neutron scattering on an atom is ( see section 4 ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 are neutron s and @xmath4 are atom s initial and final momenta , @xmath5 is ratio of the neutron s @xmath6 to the atomic @xmath7 masses .",
    "the amplitude ( [ intr ] ) is the product of scattering amplitude @xmath8 and two @xmath9-functions related to the momentum and energy conservation laws .",
    "it is simplified after integration over @xmath10 , which eliminates the first @xmath9-function , and is reduced to @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "expressions ( [ intr ] ) and ( [ intr1 ] ) are very natural , however the two ways of probability calculation : one directly in laboratory reference frame ( lf ) , and another one via center of mass ( cm ) reference frame give two different results .",
    "[ [ in - lf ] ] in lf + + + + +    we directly integrate over @xmath15 and get @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is neutron scattering angle , and @xmath18 .",
    "with @xmath19 the probability @xmath20 of scattering in lf is @xmath21 .",
    "[ [ in - the - standard - approach ] ] in the standard approach + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    ( look , for instance  @xcite ) we transform ( [ intr1 ] ) to cm , i.e. change variable : @xmath22 , integrate over @xmath23 , find @xmath24 of neutron scattering into the cm scattering angle @xmath25 , and obtain probability @xmath26 .",
    "transformation of this probability back to lf gives @xmath27 .",
    "[ [ the - ambiguity - is ] ] the ambiguity is : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    @xmath28 .",
    "now we present these calculations in details , but first we want to stress , that the direct calculation , which is the main new point , does not include change of reference frames , while all the calculations with change of frames lead to the standard result .",
    "so it is not profitable to seek for errors in change of reference frames .      since @xmath29",
    ", we directly integrate @xmath9-function in ( [ intr1 ] ) over @xmath15 and get @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total momentum of the neutron and atom , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is a unit vector in the scattering direction of @xmath34 .",

    "the fpwst , if we accept it notwithstanding of the ambiguity ( it will be later eliminated ) , gives probabilities and not cross sections .",
    "to see how to match them to experiment , we in the next section discuss what do experimentalists really measure , and how to get a cross section from probability .",
    "this discussion inevitably leads to a wave packet description of free neutron .",
    "in the third section we show what are the drawbacks of all the three theories pointed above , in fourth section we derive scattering amplitude ( [ intr ] ) and demonstrate how to get the standard cross section for neutron scattering in monatomic gas .    in 5-th section some wave packets and their properties",
    "are discussed . in particular , we consider scattering of a wave packet from a fixed center and show that in linear theory probability of scattering does not depend on impact parameter , so to get a cross section from probability we need a nonlinear interaction .    in 6-th section some ways to resolve contradictions and ambiguities are proposed , in section 7 some experiments to investigate wave packet properties are discussed , and in conclusion the results of the paper are summarized .",
    "almost all experiments ( exceptions are reflectometry and diffractometry ) are interpreted in terms of scattering cross sections . here",
    "we analyze what is really measured , how cross section is extracted and how it is theoretically defined .",
    "this analysis leads to conclusion that to get a cross section from probability we have to introduce a parameter @xmath61 with dimension of area , characterizing the size of the neutron wave function .      for definition of the scattering cross section we can look at an experiment schematically shown in fig .",
    "if the detector registers @xmath62 scattered neutrons per unit time , then the total probability @xmath63 for a single neutron to be scattered in the sample into a given direction is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the neutron flux density , @xmath66 is the area of the sample immersed into the neutron flux , and @xmath67 is the total number of neutrons incident on the sample per unit time .",
    "experimentalists divide this value by dimensional parameter @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is atomic number density in the sample , and @xmath70 is the sample width . as a result one obtains the cross section @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the volume of the sample illuminated by the incident neutron flux .",
    "the expression ( [ ratio1 ] ) is commonly accepted , but gives no insight into interaction of a single neutron with a single atom .",
    "it looks more reasonable from total probability @xmath63 ( [ prob ] ) of scattering of a single neutron in the whole sample to find the scattering probability @xmath73 of a single neutron on a single atom : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of atoms met by a single neutron on its way during the flight through the sample . to find the number of atoms on the neutron s way we have to introduce a front area @xmath61 of the incident particle wave function , and suppose that scattering takes place only , if the scattering center crosses this area .",
    "so , let the neutron wave function to have area @xmath61 , then @xmath76 . from ( [ prob1 ] )",
    "we immediately find the scattering cross section of a single neutron per single atom : @xmath77 which coincides with ( [ ratio1 ] ) .",
    "the left hand side is the cross section we must calculate , the right hand side is the experimentally defined cross section . to compare theory with experiment",
    "we must be able to calculate @xmath78 and @xmath61 .      according to all the textbooks",
    "the scattering cross section is defined as a ratio of the count rate @xmath62 of scattered particles to the flux density , @xmath65 , of the incident particles : @xmath79 if , for instance , we have a small sample , the above ratio gives the cross section of the whole sample , and if we divide this ratio by the total number of atoms in the sample , @xmath80 , illuminated by the incident flux , we obtain the result ( [ ratio1 ] ) , which defines the cross section per one atom",
    ". we call it a phenomenological definition , because it says nothing about interaction of a single neutron with a single atom .      theoretically , if you want to find a number of scattered particles for a single target atom and a given incident flux @xmath65 , you must first find , how a single particle is scattered , and how this scattering depends on impact parameter .",
    "after that we should integrate over all particles in the incident flux , and average over all possible positions of the scatterer .",
    "this procedure gives the number @xmath62 of scattered particles for the given @xmath65 .",
    "the ratio @xmath81 is an average cross section @xmath82 , and it can be compared with the phenomenological one .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 includes also dimension of a single nucleus .",
    "we can even suppose that it is related only to nucleus , and neutrons are point particles , propagating like rays of a wave .",
    "in that case @xmath61 is equal to the size @xmath83 of the nucleus , and the total cross section can never be larger than @xmath83 , because the total probability @xmath73 can never be larger than unity .",
    "this contradicts to the well known facts , that some capture cross sections can be many orders of magnitude larger than @xmath83 . to avoid this contradiction",
    ", we have to assume that @xmath61 is related to neutron and is considerably larger than @xmath83 , so we can neglect contribution of @xmath83 into @xmath61 .",
    "introduction of the finite front area means that the particle wave function is not a plane wave , but a wave packet .",
    "this wave packet can not be spreading , because , if it were , the transmission of a sample would decrease , when the sample is shifted from source to detector , and no one , so far , had ever observed such a phenomenon .",
    "one of the possible candidates for the nonspreading wave packet is the singular de broglie wave packet ( dbwp )  @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85/2 $ ] , @xmath46 determines the packet width , and @xmath86 is the wave packet velocity , which in our units @xmath87 coincides with wave vector @xmath88 . the front area of ( [ d1 ] )",
    "can be estimated as @xmath89 .",
    "some reasonings related to solution of ultra cold neutrons anomaly  @xcite , leads to @xmath90 which means that for thermal energies @xmath91 . because of that the short range interaction becomes a long range one , which is manifested in such effects as total reflection and diffraction in crystals . for description of these processes",
    "one does not use cross sections , so the parameter @xmath61 can be even omitted , and neutrons can be represented by plane waves .",
    "at present we have three theories and every one has its own drawbacks .    sht .",
    ": :    it is used only for elastic scattering and two particles scattering in    cm reference frame .",
    "it is logically inconsistent and contradicts to    canonical quantum mechanics ( cqm ) , because it does not describe free    particles after scattering .",
    "the spherical waves are not solutions of    the free schrdinger equation .",
    "to make sht self consistent one have to    find asymptotical form of spherical waves , which is a superposition of    free states or free plane waves .",

    ": :    this theory , which uses van hove correlation functions , is not a    theory , but only a set of rules how to calculate a cross section .",
    "this    `` theory '' uses free states after scattering , however it never    calculates scattering amplitudes , operates with probability per unit    time , which does not depend on time , introduces superfluous space cell    of arbitrary large size @xmath92 , a flux density for a single    particle and has other drawbacks discussed below .",
    ": :    its main goal is to justify sst .",
    "it uses asymptotical wave function    after scattering , which is a superposition of free states .",
    "more over    it calculates scattering probabilities .",
    "however these probabilities    violate unitarity , and transition from probabilities to cross sections    contains some connivance , which is not valid .",
    "now we shall consider them in details      in this theory the wave function of a scattered neutron is represented ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) as @xmath93 where plane @xmath94 and spherical @xmath95 waves describe incident and scattered particles , respectively .",
    "the scattering amplitude is @xmath96 where @xmath97 are scattering matrix elements of spherical harmonics and @xmath98 are legeandre polynomials .",
    "the simplest process is elastic s - wave scattering from a fixed center with wave function , @xmath99 in which @xmath100const .",
    "the approach with spherical waves is borrowed from classical theories of sound and classical light scattering , but it is not a quantum scattering theory , because the spherical wave does not describe a free particle .",
    "it satisfies the equation @xmath101\\frac{\\exp(ikr)}{r}=-4\\pi\\delta({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } } ) , \\label{q2a}\\ ] ] with the right hand side containing the dirac @xmath9-function .",
    "it is not identical zero in the whole space .",
    "therefore ( [ q2a ] ) is not a free equation .",
    "usually one says that we need wave function outside the point @xmath102 , and there the spherical wave satisfies the free schrdinger equation .",
    "however even the wave function of the bound state does satisfy free schrdinger equation outside the potential .",
    "nevertheless we do not consider the tails of the bound wave functions as free particles .",
    "of course , in the case of bound states the wave function tails decay exponentially at infinity , and this fact justifies why these tails are not considered as free particles .",
    "we shall show below , that the asymptotic @xmath103 of spherical waves also contains exponentially decaying waves . therefore to get real asymptotic of spherical waves at infinity we need to exclude exponentially decaying part from it too ( compare ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2ad ] ) below ) .",
    "to make sht really quantum theory we have to find asymptotical form of spherical waves , when particles are sufficiently separated after scattering .",
    "this asymptotical wave function should be a superposition @xmath104 where @xmath105 is wave vector of the length @xmath106 pointing into the direction @xmath107 in the element @xmath108 of the solid angle @xmath109 .",
    "then the probability of scattering into @xmath108 is @xmath110    the asymptotic wave function ( [ fqq2 ] ) can be found in two ways : stationary and nonstationary ones .",
    "the spherical function has 2-dimensional fourier expansion @xmath111 where we fix the direction from the scatterer to the observation point as @xmath112-axis , and integrate over all components @xmath113 parallel to @xmath114 plane with @xmath112-component of the momentum being equal to @xmath115 .",
    "the range of integration over @xmath113 ( [ 2a ] ) is infinite , and , in particular , it includes those @xmath113 , for which @xmath116 . at these @xmath113 the component @xmath117 is imaginary , and @xmath118 is an exponentially decaying function .",
    "if the distance to the observation point is large enough ( later we discuss what does it mean `` enough '' ) , we can neglect exponentially decaying terms , and restrict integration to @xmath119 : @xmath120 in this integral we can substitute @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath117 is a variable , and we introduced the step function @xmath123 , which is unity or zero , when inequality in its argument is satisfied or not , respectively .",
    "substitution of ( [ sph8 ] ) into ( [ 2ad ] ) gives @xmath124    the terms which we neglected are of the order @xmath103 because at the observation point @xmath112 ( @xmath125 ) we have @xmath126 where we replaced @xmath112 by the distance @xmath127 between scatterer and observation point .",
    "thus the asymptotical form of the wave function ( [ fq2 ] ) after scattering is just ( [ fqq2 ] ) with scattering probability amplitude @xmath128 and scattering probability @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the neutron wave length .",
    "we see that ( [ fq2 ] ) is reduced to ( [ fqq2 ] ) , when we neglect the terms of the order @xmath131 . since the decision to neglect or not to neglect this term is at will of the physicist ,",
    "then the distance @xmath127 from the center is not an asymptotical one , being even of light years size , if he uses the spherical wave . on the other side the distances of the order 1   are asymptotical ones , if @xmath131 is neglected .      to find nonstationary asymptotic of the wave function ( [ fq2 ] ) we include in it the time dependent factor @xmath133 , where @xmath134 , and use 3-dimensional fourier expansion for",

    "define the probability of scattering per unit time according to the fermi golden rule @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a matrix element of the neutron - scatterer interaction potential @xmath163 between initial @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and final @xmath166 , @xmath167 , neutron and scatterer states , respectively , and @xmath168 is the density of the neutron final states : @xmath169 the delta - function factor corresponds to the energy conservation law .",
    "it contains initial and final neutron @xmath170 and scatterer @xmath171 energies .",
    "the last factor is the phase space density of the neutron final states , which includes momentum element @xmath172 and some volume @xmath0 with an arbitrary large size @xmath92 .",
    "3 .   define neutron states before and after scattering as ( they are really free states ) @xmath173 4 .",
    "the ratio ( [ nqb4 ] ) gives the cross section @xmath174 taking into account that @xmath175 , @xmath176 , one obtains double differential scattering cross section @xmath177 to compare with experimentally measured value one averages ( [ g2a ] ) over initial states and sums over final states of the scatterer , getting @xmath178 @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the probability of scatterer to be initially in the state @xmath181 .    in the case , when @xmath182 where @xmath9-function depends on neutron and scatterer positions @xmath183 , @xmath184 respectively , the cross section ( [ gg3a ] ) becomes @xmath185 where @xmath12 is momentum transferred to the scatterer .",
    "one of contradictions here is that the probability of scattering per unit time ( [ wpg1a ] ) does not depend on time , so integral of @xmath160 over time is senseless , whereas according definition it should be less than unity .",
    "two other dubious points are : introduction of the superfluous volume @xmath0 and of flux density for a * single * particle .",

    "one would be able to find coherent amplitude , which is averaged over initial states @xmath181 of the scatterer .",
    "this amplitude gives coherent scattering cross section , which some times could carry an additional information about scattering process .      in fst",
    "( see , for example  @xcite ) , which was developed mainly to justify sst , the scattering process is divided into three stages : infinite past , where incident particle is free ; present , where the neutron interacts with a scatterer ; and infinite future , where scattered neutron is again a free particle . to work within the hilbert space of normalized states , the incident free neutron is represented by a wave packet @xmath186 with fourier expansion : @xmath187 where parameter @xmath46 characterizes dimension of the wave packet , @xmath88 is momentum of the packet , @xmath188 is a state corresponding to plane wave , @xmath189 , in coordinate space , and @xmath190 are numerical fourier coefficients .",
    "the dynamics of the packet @xmath186 is determined by free hamiltonian @xmath191 : @xmath192 after scattering the wave function becomes @xmath193 where @xmath194 is scattering matrix . and",
    "dimensionless probability of scattering is defined as @xmath195 this last formula is absolutely wrong .",

    "such a process is impossible because it completely violates unitarity .",
    "the state @xmath186 is normalized and @xmath188 is not normalizable .    from unitarity of the @xmath66-matrix",
    "it follows that norm of the wave function is preserved .",

    "then @xmath199 defines the amplitude of transition probability of the wave packet state @xmath200 with momentum @xmath88 into the wave packet state @xmath201 with momentum @xmath202 .",
    "in fact , in the books  @xcite and others only scattering of plane waves is considered , and the initial wave packet defines only spectrum of plane waves in the incident beam .",
    "however plane waves scattering gives only probability , and averaging over initial spectrum of plane waves does not change the situation .    in fst one also introduces the finite volume @xmath0 with an arbitrary large @xmath92 for justification of sst .",
    "below we show that it is possible to avoid this artificial step .",
    "we use fundamental scattering theory with plane waves ( fpwst ) and calculate scattering probability of neutron in monatomic gas .",
    "this probability , as is shown in introduction , is ambiguous , however , on one side , there is a way to find the standard expression for cross section , and on the other side , knowledge of the ambiguity helps to find the way to fight it .",
    "the authors of  @xcite and other books , make one special step to get cross section from probability , however this step contains a connivance that there is no scattering , if the scatterer does not cross the neutron wave packet . in linear scattering theory it is false , as we shall see in section 5 .",
    "nevertheless we shall accept this point , because otherwise it is absolutely impossible to get a cross section from probability .",

    "+ we resolve this contradiction simultaneously with the following ambiguity .",
    "when we apply fst with initial and final plane waves we find that calculation of neutron scattering from a moving atom gives different results , when we find scattering probability directly in lf reference frame , or via intermediate transformation to cm .",
    "+ below we show how this ambiguity can be resolved , and this resolution simultaneously resolves the contradiction between ( [ area ] ) and ( [ area1 ] ) .",
    "in the whole we must claim that there are no now a selfconsistent scattering theory .",
    "however we are to proceed with that we have at our hands .      the ambiguity arises because of the continuous spectrum of angular distribution @xmath343    no ambiguity would appear , if the angular distribution were discrete .",
    "so we shall eliminate the ambiguity , if we replace the integral in ( [ wpg39n ] ) with the integral sum @xmath344 where discrete amplitudes @xmath345 are introduced .",
    "in such a representation the probability of scattering into the angle @xmath346 is @xmath347 , and probability of scattering into the angular interval covering @xmath348 elements @xmath349 around some direction @xmath350 , is @xmath351 where @xmath352 and we supposed that @xmath353 are almost constant in the interval @xmath349 .",
    "transformation of the integral to the sum can be made with an arbitrary choice of @xmath354 around every @xmath346 , which is also an ambiguity . to resolve it",
    "we can make a step in style of quantization , i.e. we can require all the amplitude elements @xmath355 to be equal , which means that we introduce a quantum of the area @xmath356 . in the cm reference frame , where @xmath357 is constant , such a requirement means an introduction of quantum of the angular interval or uncertainty @xmath358 .",
    "below we discuss what value this quantum can be of .",
    "when we transform from one reference frame to another , we see a deformation of both @xmath359 and @xmath358 , however the amplitude elements @xmath360 and the number of such elements in the whole integral @xmath361 remain the same .",
    "therefore , if we take some amount of amplitude elements in the center of mass reference frame , square every element , and after that transform to the laboratory reference frame , then we obtain the same amount of the squared elements in the laboratory frame , and they will be confined in some angular interval . if we transform from center of mass to laboratory frame without squaring the amplitude elements , and square them only after the transformation , we obtain the same number of squared elements in the same angular interval as before . which means that our result is completely invariant under galilean transformation .",
    "therefore we have the full right to use center of mass reference frame without a danger to get an ambiguous result after changing of the reference frame .      according to ( [ fbcm ] ) we have @xmath362",
    "therefore the scattering amplitude element is @xmath363 probability of scattering into some interval of solid angle @xmath364 is @xmath365 the differential scattering cross section becomes @xmath366 and we immediately obtain that to get @xmath367 , we have to require @xmath368 it means that the angular quantum @xmath358 correlates with the wave packet cross area @xmath61 !",
    "this correlation is very important because it resolves the contradiction of two results : ( [ area ] ) and ( [ area1 ] ) .",
    "since , without doubt , the interval @xmath358 is small , we must have @xmath61 to be large .",
    "so the contradiction between ( [ area ] ) and ( [ area1 ] ) is resolved in favor to ( [ area1 ] ) .",
    "simple consideration of a scattering process shows a contradiction inherent in the sht .",
    "on one side we use plane waves as eigenstates of a particle , and on the other side describe scattered particles with spherical waves , which are not even solutions of the free schrdinger equation .",
    "rigorous approach , which resolves this contradiction , creates another one . with this approach",
    "we can calculate only dimensionless probabilities of scattering , while for interpretation of experiments we need cross sections with dimensions of area . to resolve this second contradiction and to get cross sections instead of dimensionless probabilities",
    ", we have to introduce some front area @xmath61 of the wave function for the incident particle .",
    "thus we arrive at wave packets , and must describe scattering process with wave packets instead of plane waves .",
    "however , while doing that we arrive at the next contradiction : the wave packets scatter similarly to plane waves , and scattering does not depend on whether the scatterer crosses the wave packet or not .",
    "this contradiction is a result of linearity of the quantum mechanics . to resolve this contradiction",
    "we must introduce a nonlinearity at least into interaction term to assure that scattering takes place only , when the scatterer is inside the front area of the wave packet .",
    "however , even with this hypothesis in mind we have another contradiction : the wave packet have to be large , but can not be large .",
    "if we abandon wave packet and calculate scattering probability with plane waves , we find that the probability of scattering is an ambiguous value , which depends on a way of calculation . to resolve this ambiguity we are to quantize the process of scattering .",
    "this quantization leads to replacement of angular integrals with discrete integral sums .",
    "it is amazing that resolution of the ambiguity simultaneously resolves the contradiction related to the value of area @xmath61 pointed out in ( [ area ] ) and ( [ area1 ] ) .",
    "the last result proves that some truth is contained indeed in our investigations .    as for sst",
    "it is not a theory , because it is not justified by fst , but only a set of rules how to calculate cross sections .",
    "it can be used by everyone , who is satisfied with these rules , notwithstanding that they are not well justified .",

[ [ reply - of - non - anonymous - referee - on - november-1-and - my - reply - on - november-02 ] ] reply of non anonymous referee on november 1 and my reply on november 02 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                  the manuscript ah10019 , `` contradictions of quantum scattering theory , '' by vladimir k. ignatovich has been rejected by physical review a , and the author has requested reconsideration .",
    "the decision was based on the position of the referee that the evidence presented in the manuscript is not sufficient to show that conventional scattering theory has fundamental flaws , as claimed by the author .",
    "the referee singled out three examples of points made in the manuscript that were not convincing in this regard .",
    "the author has attempted to show that the comments made by the referee are not valid .",
    "the first point concerns eq .",
    "( 61 ) and the statements made in the manuscript : `` this last formula is absolutely wrong .",
    "it means that scattering transforms the wave packet into a plane wave . ''",
    "the referee does not accept this statement , because the formula does not mean that the scattered wave function is a plane wave .",
    "the referee correctly points out that eq .",
    "( 61 ) represents the probability density that the scattered particle will have a particular momentum and that it does not imply that the final state is a plane wave .",
    "this is the conventional and correct quantum mechanical interpretation of such an equation .",
    "the subsequent discussion in the manuscript does not support the author s claim , as suggested in his resubmission letter .    * my reply .",
    "before to find momentum density of scattered particle , you should define the wave function of the particle .",
    "your disagreement with my arguments shows how many unclear notions quantum mechanics contains . *",
    "the second point concerns eq .",
    "( 29 ) . in the manuscript",
    "it is stated that `` the spherical wave does not describe a free particle . '' in fact , outside of the region containing the origin , the spherical wave does describe a free particle , as pointed out by the referee , and the claim by the author is not valid .",
    "the author goes on to suggest that his claim supported by the fact that bound - state wave functions outside of the potential decay exponentially , however this analogy is not convincing .",
    "in fact , the solution in eq .",
    "( 29 ) is a free solution outside of the potential for either a scattering state or a bound state .",
    "the only difference is that @xmath147 is imaginary in the case of a bound state .    *",
    "why do nt you comment my equations ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) ?",
    "i tell just about imaginary component of @xmath147 .",
    "the waves , which have imaginary component in some direction must be excluded from asymptotic .",
    "*    the third point made by the referee is that the conclusion by the author that the scattering of a wave packet is independent of the impact parameter is problematic .",
    "the author claims that this is a problem with conventional scattering theory , however it appears more likely that the author s interpretation of scattering theory is at fault .",
    "the source of the problem is indicated in the statement in the manuscript : `` the independence of the scattering amplitude on position of scatterer is well understandable in linear wave mechanics . indeed , the wave packet is a superposition of plane waves , which exist in the whole space .",
    "they cancel each other outside the packet , but they exist , and because they are scattered independently of each other , the whole packets scattering does not depend on position of the scatterer . ''",
    "the last statement is not correct and overlooks the fact that if the initial state is a wave packet , then the plane wave components will scatter individually in such a way that their coherent superposition will destructively interfere to give a small scattering probability if the impact parameter of the initial wave packet is large .",
    "evidently , the calculation in the manuscript makes approximations that lose this information .",
    "however , it is not appropriate for the referee to correct the manuscript line by line in order to show how to fix the problem .",
    "in addition to the valid criticisms of the referee , it should be noted that the description of scattering in terms of wave packets is not a new result .",
    "for example , the subject is discussed in the article `` scattering of wave packets , '' by eyvind h. wichmann , american journal of physics , 33 , 20 ( 1965 ) .",
    "the abstract of that article notes that : `` the aim of this paper is mainly pedagogical , and the final results obtained are old and well established . ''",
    "* my reply .",
    "i thank you very much for the reference .",
    "i rushed into library , grasped the journal , buried myself in it . and was greatly disappointed .",
    "there are no wave packet at all , except words",
    ". may be it is a special pedagogical trick of am.j.phys . ?",
    "*        * dear dr .",
    "mohr , it is very difficult to discuss the paper point by point with a man , who does not want to listen arguments .",
    "i was surprised that you did not understand my simplest arguments about exponential decay of some part of spherical wave asymptotic ( eq .",
    "( 32 ) and ( 33 ) ) .",
    "do you understand that the @xmath390 becomes imaginary , when @xmath116 ?",
