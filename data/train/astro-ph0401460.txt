    "accretion processes are now believed to play a major role in many astrophysical objects , from protostars to disks around compact stars and agn .",
    "such systems have been studied at different levels depending on their physical properties .",
    "geometry of the disk ( thin or thick ) , transport of the thermal energy inside the disk , self - gravity of the accreting gas and the magnetic fields are among the most important factors which shape any theory for such systems . for simplicity ,",
    "traditional models of accretion disks assume geometrically thin configuration and neglect self - gravity of the accreting material ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ; pringle 1981 ) .",
    "these models have been extended by considering large scale magnetic fields , polytropic equation of state and better understanding of the mechanism of angular momentum transport ( e.g. , livio and pringle 1992 ; ogilvie 1997 ; duschl , strittmatter and biermann 2000 ) . however , the key ingredient in all such models is that the generated heat by turbulent viscosity does not remain in the flow . in other words ,",
    "all of the viscously dissipated energy was assumed to be radiated away immediately .",
    "another type of accretion flow known as advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) has been proposed , in which generated heat by viscosity can not escape from the system and retains in the flow ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan and yi 1994 ) . during recent years ,",
    "adafs have been paid attention as plausible states of accretion flows around black holes , active galactic nuclei or dim galactic nuclei ( for review see kato , fukue and mineshige 1998 ) . using similarity method , ogilvie ( 1999 ) ( hereafter ;",
    "og ) extended original steady state self - similar solutions to time dependent case .",
    "his solutions describe quasi - spherical time dependent advection dominated accretion flows .    on the other hand",
    ", many authors tried to study the effects related to the disk self - gravity .",
    "recent observations show significant deviations from keplerian rotation in objects that are believed to be accretion disk , and in some cases , there are strong evidences that the amount of mass in the disk is large ( e.g. , drimmel 1996 ; greenhill 1996 ) .",
    "the role of self - gravity in accretion disks was discussed by paczyski ( 1978 ) , who studied vertical structure of the disk under the influence of self - gravity . some authors investigated role of self - gravity on waves in the disk ( lin and pringle 1987 ; lin and pringle 1990 ) . within the framework of geometrically thin configuration , mineshige and umemura ( 1996 )",
    "extended classical self - similar adaf solution ( narayan and yi 1994 ) and found a global one dimensional disk solutions influenced by self - gravity both in the radial and perpendicular directions to the disk . in another study ,",
    "mineshige and umemura ( 1997 ) extended previous steady solutions to the time dependent case while the effect of self - gravity of the disk had been taken into account .",
    "they used isothermal equation of state and so their solutions describe a viscous accretion disk in slow accretion limit .",
    "then , mineshige , nakayma and umemura ( 1997 ) extended this study by obtaining solutions for polytropic viscous accretion disks . also , tsuribe ( 1999 ) studied self - similar collapse of an isothermal viscous accretion disk .",
    "although solution of mineshige and umemura ( 1996 ) describes self - gravitating adafs , applicability of the solution restricts to geometrically thin configurations .",
    "the most appropriate geometrical configuration for advective flows , rather than thin , is quasi - spherical as has been confirmed by many authors ( e.g , narayan and yi 1995 ) .",
    "og presented the first semi - analytical quasi - spherical , time - dependent adafs solution . here",
    "we note that although og considered advection - dominated accretion flow in a point mass potential , it is straightforward to relax this assumption so as to describe the effect of self - gravitation on quasi - spherical advection - dominated accretion flows using time - dependent similarity solutions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the general problem of constructing a model for quasi - spherical ,",
    "self - gravitating accretion flow is defined .",
    "the self - similar solutions are presented in section 3 , and the effects of the input parameters are examined .",
    "we summarize the results in section 4 .",
    "we start with the approach adopted by ogilvie ( 1999 ) who studied quasi - spherical accretion flow without self - gravity . in his approach ,",
    "the equations are written in spherical coordinates @xmath2 by considering the equatorial plane @xmath3 and neglecting terms with any @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence .",
    "it implies that each physical variable represents approximately spherically averaged quantity .",
    "so , all the physical quantities depend only on the spherical radius @xmath6 and time @xmath7 .",
    "self - gravity of the accreting gas can be considered simply by poisson equation and the corresponding term in the momentum equation .",
    "the governing equations are the continuity equation , @xmath8 the equations of motion , @xmath9 @xmath10,\\ ] ] the poisson s equation , @xmath11 and the energy equation , @xmath12 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in order to solve the equations , we need to assign the kinematic coefficient of viscosity @xmath13 .",
    "although there are many uncertainties about the exact form of viscosity , authors introduce some prescriptions for @xmath14 regarding dimensional analysis or just based on phenomenological considerations ( e.g , duschl , strittmatter and biermann 2000 ) .",
    "we employ the usual @xmath1 prescription for the viscosity , which we write as ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the keplerian angular velocity at radius @xmath6 .",
    "this prescription originally introduced for viscosity in thin accretion disk , however , it has been widely used for studying dynamics of thick accretion disk , such as adafs .    to simplify the equations",
    ", we make the following substitutions : @xmath17 where @xmath18 under these transformation , the continuity equation does not change and the rest of equations are cast into @xmath19 @xmath20,\\ ] ] @xmath21 @xmath22 ^ 2.{\\label{eq : ener}}\\ ] ]",
    "we look for self - similar solutions of equations ( [ eq : con ] ) and ( [ eq : mom])-([eq : ener ] ) and reduce this system into a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "we define a self - similar variable @xmath23 where @xmath24 and demand that @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 substituting these expressions into the above equations , we obtain the following set of self - similar equations : @xmath30 @xmath31,\\label{eq : ang}\\ ] ] @xmath32 @xmath33 ^ 2.{\\label{eq : ener1}}\\ ] ] interestingly , the continuity equation is integrable and gives @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant and should be zero .",
    "thus , @xmath36 also , we can obtain rotational similarity function @xmath37 simply by integrating equation ( [ eq : ener1 ] ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is rotational velocity at some @xmath41 . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath41 defines the outer boundary of the accretiong gas .",
    "this equation correctly gives @xmath42 , and reaches to a maximum @xmath43 by increasing @xmath44 from zero to a point at @xmath45 .",
    "one can simply show @xmath46{4}}(\\frac{\\xi_{\\rm s } } { \\sqrt[4]{\\xi_{\\rm s}}-\\sqrt[4]{\\xi_{\\rm 0}}})^{4/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48{4}}(\\frac{\\xi_{\\rm s } } { \\sqrt[4]{\\xi_{\\rm s}}-\\sqrt[4]{\\xi_{\\rm 0}}})^{1/3}.\\ ] ] clearly , behaviour of rotational velocity and the other physical variables except for the radial velocity , depend on @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "we can consider both @xmath41 and @xmath40 as free parameters , however , it s possible to determine them uniquely , if we parameterize self - similar solutions using conserved quantities , e.g. mass of the system . as can be seen from the definition of @xmath49 , the above self - similar solutions are applicable within the range of @xmath50 if we consider a positive value for @xmath1 .",
    "we can derive asymptotic solutions when approaching the origin @xmath51 as follows @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 these asymptotic solutions are valuable when performing numerical integrations to obtain similarity solutions starting from @xmath55 .",
    "note that the behaviour of the solutions near to origin only depends on @xmath49 and @xmath1 .",
    "we now proceed to solve the rest of above similarity equations . by substituting equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) into equation ( [ eq : ang ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath56 where @xmath57.\\ ] ] after some algebra , from this equation and equations ( [ eq : motion ] ) and ( [ eq : poss ] ) , the following equation is obatined : @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62    this equation can easily be integrated considering appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we can parameterize the solutions by @xmath41 as a function of the mass of the accreting gas and the viscosity parameter @xmath1 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "total mass of the accreting gas is @xmath65 using similarity solutions , this equation reads @xmath66 substituting from poisson equation ( [ eq : poss ] ) , we have @xmath67 by inserting @xmath68 from equation ( [ eq : motion ] ) into the above equation , we finally obtain @xmath69.\\label{eq : set1}\\ ] ] another relation is obtained from equation ( [ eq : main1 ] ) , as follows @xmath70 where @xmath71{\\xi_{\\rm s}}}{3\\alpha\\lambda}(3\\phi_{\\rm",
    "s}-2\\lambda \\sqrt[4]{\\xi_{\\rm s}}).\\ ] ] now , we can use the standard fourth - order runge - kutta scheme to integrate nonlinear ordinary differential equation ( [ eq : main ] ) from sufficiently small @xmath44 to @xmath41 . given @xmath72 and @xmath40 and using asymptotic solutions near to the origin ( i.e. , equations ( [ eq : asy2 ] ) and ( [ eq : asy3 ] ) )",
    ", one can start numerical integration and equation ( [ eq : set1 ] ) gives corresponding ratio of masses , i.e. @xmath73 . before presenting results of integration",
    ", it would be interesting to explore the typical behaviour of rotational velocity @xmath37 .",
    "just as an illustrative example we follow another approach : lets assume that we know @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath73 from numerical integration and so , one can determine @xmath76 and @xmath40 from equations ( [ eq : set1 ] ) and ( [ eq : set2 ] ) uniquely .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath77 and @xmath78 and consider non - zero but negligible @xmath74 , the outer boundary of the system is determined analytically @xmath79{2\\lambda^{4}+4.5(\\frac{m}{m_{\\star}}+1)-\\sqrt{4\\lambda^{4}(\\lambda^{4}+4.5(\\frac{m}{m_{\\star}}+1))}},\\ ] ] and @xmath80{\\xi_{\\rm s}}.\\ ] ] in this case , figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows @xmath41 and @xmath40 as functions of @xmath1 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath83 . as this figure shows for fixed ratio of masses , the outer radius of the system increases by increasing the viscosity coefficient @xmath1 . also ,",
    "if the ratio of masses increases , the outer radius increases irrespective of the exact value of @xmath1 . however , rotational velocity at @xmath41 ( i.e. @xmath40 ) is not very sensitive to values of @xmath1 or @xmath73 for large values of @xmath1 .",
    "if the viscosity coefficient @xmath1 tends to small values , on the other hand , the rotational velocity @xmath40 increases significantly .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] , we plot rotational velocity of representative cases with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . as this figure shows , rotation of the flow increases from the center to the outer radius .",
    "there are two regimes as rotation of the flow concerns .",
    "while in the outer part , profile of the rotational velocity in similarity space is nearly flat , in the inner portion this velocity strongly increases .",
    "however , for low values of @xmath1 ( e.g. @xmath86 ) , rotational velocity reaches to a maximum then with nearly constant and small slope decreases . also , the rotational velocity increases as the parameter @xmath1 decreases and the outer region with flat rotation profile becomes larger , as the ratio of the mass of the accreting gas to the mass of the central object increases . in other words , while rotational behaviour of the inner part is nearly independent of the ratio of masses , the outer portion s rotation and it s extension are sensitive to that ratio .    in figure",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] , typical behaviour of the density and the pressure in similarity space are shown .",
    "we can see in the inner region the solutions can clearly be described by asymptotic solutions ( [ eq : asy2 ] ) and ( [ eq : asy3 ] ) , however , outer region has different density and pressure profiles .",
    "interestingly , behaviour of solutions in the inner region is independent of the extension of the system ( @xmath41 ) and the rotational velocity @xmath40 . as the ratio of @xmath73 increases , the extension of the outer region becomes larger",
    "flows with large values of @xmath1 have lower central mass concentration comparing to accretions with low values of @xmath1 .",
    "generally , one can say quasi - spherical , self - gravitating accretion flows of our model consist of two parts , one inner portion with high density and an outer part with nearly lower density and flat rotation profile .",
    "however , in both regions the radial velocity is the same , irrespective of the input parameters .    from equations ( [ eq : vr ] ) and ( [ eq : vp ] ) , we can simply show that the ratio of the radial velocity to the rotational velocity is @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4 ] shows this ratio for @xmath88 and @xmath86 and three different values of @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , this ratio of velocities are much smaller than unity , implying that at each radius @xmath6 and at any time @xmath7 , rotational velocity is greater than the radial velocity . however , as the viscosity parameter @xmath1 increases , the ratio increases as well .",
    "this behaviour is easy to understand ; because we showed that radial similarity velocity @xmath89 is proportional to similarity variable @xmath44 , independent of the input parameters .",
    "however , rotational similarity velocity @xmath90 decreases by increasing the parameter @xmath1 , as can be seen from figure [ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "so , the ratio @xmath91 increases in the case that @xmath1 increases .    as we showed the total mass of the accreting gas",
    "is conserved .",
    "we can simply write the integral representing the angular momentum as @xmath92 . using the similarity solutions",
    ", we can show that the total angular momentum @xmath93 is proportional to @xmath94 . in non - self - gravitating quasi - spherical accretion flow ,",
    "@xmath93 is conserved and the total mass @xmath95 is proportional to @xmath96 as has been shown by og .",
    "but our solutions imply that the total mass of accreting material is conserved and angular momentum is decreasing . also , the central density @xmath97 increases as @xmath98 . for non - self - gravitating flow",
    ", we see another behaviour : @xmath99 .",
    "however , the radius of the flow in both cases decreases in proportion to @xmath100 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied quasi - spherical accretion flow , in which heat generated by viscosity retained in the flow . in opposition to the usual studies performed up to now , we have considered self - gravity of the flow .",
    "we derived similarity solutions for such flows which are applicable within the range @xmath101 , if we consider positive value of @xmath1 .",
    "radial and rotational velocities have been obtained analytically . obtained solutions parameterized by the ratio of the disk mass to the central object mass , @xmath73 , and the viscosity parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "we showed that the extension of the accreting gas depends on this ratio and the viscosity parameter .",
    "more importantly , these input parameters have direct effect on the rotational velocity .",
    "our solutions are different from the solutions by og in various respects .",
    "we found that the radial similarity velocity is in proportion to @xmath44 , implying no critical point .",
    "this fortunate circumstance let us to integrate rest of the equations simply , although physically one should bear in mind this kind of velocity ( i.e. , independent of input parameters ) is as a result of mathematical limitations of similarity method . at the outer edge of the accreting gas , the density and the pressure",
    "have low values comparing to the central region .",
    "other viscosity laws have been proposed , for instance the @xmath102-prescription which is based on analogy with turbulence observed in laboratory sheared flows and gives @xmath103 ( duschl , strittmatter and biermann 2000 ) .",
    "although we have not explored self - gravitating accretion with this prescription , there are self - similar solutions with similarity indices the same as those have been found with @xmath1-prescription in this paper . however , ordinary differential equations governing the similarity physical variables are different and should be solved numerically",
    ". it would be interesting one compare the similarity solutions with @xmath102-prescription with those we have obtained here ."
