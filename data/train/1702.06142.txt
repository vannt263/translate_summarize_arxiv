    "quantum systems are usually described by a hilbert space , a state vector , and a hamiltonian .",
    "do these structures alone fully characterize a physical system ? without specifying more information , like a preferred choice of basis , it is difficult to make sense of the hamiltonian or the state .",
    "for example , consider the one - dimensional ising model , with hamiltonian @xmath0 the hamiltonian clearly describes a chain of locally coupled two - level systems .",
    "this interpretation is possible because the expression for the hamiltonian implicitly includes a partition of the total hilbert space into subsystems using a tensor product factorization , @xmath1 this choice of  tensor product structure \" ( tps ) allows one to write the hamiltonian simply in terms of local operators .",
    "however , if one does not specify a tps but instead writes the hamiltonian as a large matrix in some arbitrary basis , the system becomes difficult to interpret .",
    "is it the one - dimensional ising model , or is it a collection of interacting particles in three dimensions ?",
    "up to a change of basis , different hamiltonians are only distinguished by their energy spectra . moreover , the only canonical choice of basis is the energy eigenbasis .",
    "thus the hamiltonian and state vector alone do not yield an obvious physical description , at least without a choice of tps .    we therefore ask , without a preferred choice of basis , is there a natural way to decompose the hilbert space into subsystems ( i.e. tensor factors ) , knowing only the hamiltonian ?",
    "in other words , do the energy eigenspaces and spectrum alone determine a natural choice of tps ?",
    "this is a question that has rarely been addressed in the literature , though it is discussed in a few papers such as @xcite .",
    "more commonly , it has been assumed that a preferred tps must be specified before any further progress can be made in describing the system @xcite . to even attempt finding a natural tps",
    ", one must first specify what constitutes a natural choice . here , we seek a choice of subsystems such that most pairs of subsystems do not directly interact .",
    "that is , we want the hamiltonian to act locally with respect to the chosen tps .    the question of finding a natural tps is especially relevant when one considers dualities in quantum systems .",
    "for instance , consider the mapping @xmath2 under which the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional ising model becomes @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are boundary terms .",
    "the mapping demonstrates two different sets of variables , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which define two different tps s .",
    "the hamiltonian acts locally with respect to both tps s , even though the @xmath6 and @xmath7 operators are non - locally related to each other .",
    "we say that the @xmath6 and @xmath7 descriptions are  dual , \" providing different local descriptions of the same hamiltonian .",
    "a simple argument in section [ sec : existence ] demonstrates that given a random hamiltonian , there is usually no choice of tps for which the hamiltonian is local .",
    "however , given a generic hamiltonian that is local in _ some _ tps , we can ask whether that is the unique tps for which the hamiltonian is local .",
    "in other words , given a hamiltonian with some local description , is that local description unique ?",
    "we present evidence that generic local hamiltonians have unique local descriptions : that is , dualities are the exception rather than the rule . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum is generically sufficient to uniquely determine a natural choice of tps , whenever such a choice exists .",
    "we formalize a version of this statement and then prove a weaker result .",
    "in particular , we show that by finding a single example of a hamiltonian with a unique local tps , one can then prove that almost all local hamiltonians have a unique local tps .",
    "( by  local tps , \" we mean a tps in which the hamiltonian is local . )",
    "this genericity result holds for @xmath8-local hamiltonians on systems of any finite size , as well as for several other notions of locality . restricting to the class of translation - invariant , nearest - neighbor hamiltonians on a small number of qubits",
    ", we proceed to numerically find an example of such a hamiltonian with unique local tps .",
    "when combined with the numerical result , the analytic result mentioned above provides an effective proof that there exists a unique local tps for generic local hamiltonians within this restricted class .",
    "we speculate that this conclusion extends to generic local hamiltonians on systems of any finite size .",
    "all results presented are derived for models with a finite number of finite - dimensional subsystems .",
    "such models may be used to approximate regularized quantum field theories , although the results here are not rigorously extended to infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "interesting subtleties may exist for infinite - dimensional systems , both due to the possibility of continuous spectra and also due to the breakdown of analyticity , familiar from the study of phase transitions .",
    "however , we speculate that results of a similar spirit would still hold in the large - system limit .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sections [ sec : tps ] and [ sec :",
    "locality ] , we formalize the notion of tps s and local hamiltonians . in section [ sec : main ] , we address the main question of this paper , providing analytic results .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thrm : constduals ] in section [ sec : constduals ] may be skipped without affecting one s understanding of the remaining sections .",
    "section [ sec : numerics ] explains the numerical examples needed to augment the analytic results . in section [ sec : gauge ] , we discuss generalizations of tps s , needed for fermions and gauge theories . finally , we comment on how our results frame discussions of quantum mechanics and quantum gravity .",
    "here we precisely define the notion of a tensor product structure , or tps .",
    "often , one considers a hilbert space with an explicit tensor factorization @xmath9 where the subsystems have hilbert spaces @xmath10 .",
    "we will usually imagine that the subsystems correspond to spatial lattice sites .",
    "( in few - body quantum mechanics , the subsystems might correspond to distinguishable particles , whereas in many - body physics or regularized quantum field theory , the subsystems might correspond to lattice sites , momentum modes , quasiparticle modes , or some other choice . )",
    "our first task is to define a tps on an abstract hilbert space @xmath11 that is not written as an explicit tensor product .",
    "this formalism will lend precision to the discussion of different tensor product structures on the same hilbert space , the topic at the heart of this paper .",
    "consider a map @xmath12 on a hilbert space @xmath11 which is an isomorphism ( unitary map ) @xmath13 the choice of isomorphism endows @xmath11 with a notion of locality : one can then speak of local operators , subsystems , entanglement , and so on within the hilbert space @xmath11 . for instance , we say the operator @xmath14 on @xmath11 is local to subsystem @xmath15 if @xmath16 is local to @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the entanglement entropy of a state @xmath17 is defined as the entanglement entropy of @xmath18 .",
    "these notions will remain unchanged if @xmath12 is composed with a map @xmath19 that acts unitarily on each subsystem .",
    "we therefore define a tps as follows : + * definition ( tps ) : * a tps @xmath20 of hilbert space @xmath11 is an equivalence class of isomorphisms @xmath21 , where @xmath22 whenever @xmath23 may be written as a product of local unitaries @xmath24 and permutations of subsystems . + to avoid confusion , note that the usage of  local \" in the phraselocal unitary \" is distinct from its usage in  local hamiltonian . \" local unitaries are products of unitaries acting on single tensor factors , while local hamiltonians are sums of operators acting on small subsets of tensor factors .",
    "another equivalent and useful way to define a tps involves observables rather than states . in short ,",
    "a tps naturally defines subalgebras of observables local to each subsystem , but we can turn this data around and use the subalgebras to define the tps .",
    "this perspective was developed by @xcite .",
    "let us collect the local observables as a set of mutually commuting subalgebras @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the algebra of operators on @xmath11 , and @xmath27 denotes the algebra of operators of the form @xmath28 i.e.  operators that act as the identity on all subsystems except @xmath15 .    with this motivation",
    ", we can equivalently define a tps on @xmath11 as a collection of of subalgebras @xmath29 , @xmath30 , such that the following hold :    1 .",
    "the @xmath27 mutually commute , @xmath31=0 $ ] for @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   the @xmath27 are independent , @xmath33 .",
    "3 .   the @xmath27 generate the whole algebra of observables , @xmath34 .",
    "the above definition is equivalent to the first definition , because a choice of subalgebras subject to the above conditions will uniquely determine an equivalence class of isomorphisms @xmath20 that give rise to the corresponding subalgebras .",
    "( the equivalence of definitions essentially follows from the result stated in @xcite . )",
    "since one can specify a tps either by an equivalence class @xmath20 or a collection of subalgebras @xmath35 , we will switch between these notations freely .    for a hilbert space @xmath11 without additional structure like a hamiltonian , no choice of tps is more interesting or meaningful than another . that is , even though two choices @xmath29 and @xmath36 may differ , neither choice is significant on its own because the states and operators of @xmath11 have no identifying structure to begin with",
    ". however , we will be interested in a hilbert space equipped with a hamiltonian @xmath37 , and this additional structure _ does _ distinguish certain states and operators , namely the operator @xmath37 and its eigenvectors .",
    "the choice of tps then acquires more meaning ; for instance , the ground state might be entangled with respect to one tps but separable in another .    on the other hand",
    ", certain tps s will be effectively equivalent with respect to a given hamiltonian .",
    "one may think of the operator @xmath38 on @xmath39 as an expression of @xmath37 with respect to tps @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , two operators on @xmath39 describe physically equivalent systems if they are the same up to conjugation by local unitaries , permutation of subsystems , and transposition .",
    "that is , conjugation by local unitaries is merely a re - labeling of the basis within tensor factors , while permutation of subsystems is merely a re - labeling of how subsystems are labeled . and",
    "transposition of the entire hamiltonian , , there exists a unitary operator @xmath40 such that @xmath41 since transposition preserves the spectrum . ]",
    "namely @xmath42 , only corresponds to complex conjugation , or a relabeling of @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore say that two tps s @xmath44 and @xmath45 are equivalent _ with respect to the hamiltonian h _ if the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 on @xmath39 are the same up to conjugation by local unitaries , permutation of subsystems , and transposition .",
    "the above may be encapsulated by the following definition .",
    "although this definition may appear unnecessarily formal , we hope it will eliminate any vagueness of the discussion , and the definition will not require careful parsing to follow the paper in general .",
    "+   + * definition ( equivalence of tps ) : * two choices @xmath48 and @xmath49 of hilbert space , hamiltonian , and tps are equivalent when there exists a unitary @xmath50 such that @xmath51 or in addition to @xmath51 , one could allow @xmath40 to be an anti - automorphism of the @xmath52-algebra of observables .",
    "automorphisms of the algebra of observables are given by unitary conjugation , while anti - automorphisms ( multiplication - reversing homomorphisms ) are given by the composition of unitary conjugation and transposition .",
    "] @xmath53 , and such that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is some permutation of @xmath56 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are equivalent when there exists a unitary @xmath50 such that @xmath51 or @xmath53 , and such that @xmath59=[t'u]$ ] .",
    "+   + we will be most interested in considering the same hilbert space and hamiltonian with different tps s , given by @xmath57 and @xmath60 .",
    "rather than talk about two different tps s @xmath61 for the same hamiltonian @xmath37 , we can often simplify the discussion by talking about two different hamiltonians @xmath62 on the space @xmath63 with fixed tps . both perspectives are equivalent .",
    "this observation will be important and bears repeating .",
    "+ * observation : * it is equivalent to consider either perspective :    1 .   a hilbert space @xmath64 with fixed hamiltonian @xmath37 and varying choice of tps @xmath20 or @xmath65 , or 2 .   a hilbert space @xmath63 with fixed tps and unitarily varying choice of hamiltonians @xmath66 or @xmath67 with the same spectrum .",
    "for some fixed hamiltonian @xmath37 , questions about the existence of a tps in which @xmath37 is local may then be translated into questions about the existence of local hamiltonians with the same spectrum as @xmath37 .",
    "the notion of duality can also be expressed in either of these perspectives : + * definition ( dual ) : * from the first perspective above , we say that two tps s are dual if the given hamiltonian is local in both tps s and if also the tps s are inequivalent with respect to that hamiltonian . from the second perspective",
    ", we say that two hamiltonians are dual if they are local , have the same spectrum , and can not be related by local unitaries , permutations of subsystems , and transposition .",
    "+ the results of sections [ sec : main ] and [ sec : numerics ] will largely be cast in the second perspective , i.e. as statements about the existence of different local hamiltonians with the same spectrum . however , the results may always be re - cast in the first perspective , as results about the existence of different local tps for the same hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , we can either say that generic local hamiltonians uniquely determine a local tps , or we can say that the spectrum of a generic local hamiltonian will uniquely determine the hamiltonian .",
    "given a hilbert space @xmath11 and hamiltonian @xmath37 , what qualitatively distinguishes different choices of tps ?",
    "most broadly , we might ask whether some tps s yield simpler , more meaningful , or more calculationally tractable descriptions of a system . more specifically , we are interested in tps s for which the hamiltonian appears local , in the sense that it only exhibits interactions among certain collections of subsystems",
    ".    we should clarify what it means for a hamiltonian to include an interaction among a given collection of tensor factors .",
    "in general , one can write a hamiltonian on @xmath68 qudits ( i.e. , @xmath68 systems of local dimension @xmath69 ) as @xmath70 where the operators @xmath71 for @xmath72 form an orthogonal basis for single - qudit operators on site @xmath15 .",
    "this decomposition is unique , up to the choice of basis @xmath71 .",
    "the terms @xmath73 , for instance , are considered as interactions between qudits @xmath15 , @xmath74 , and @xmath8 .",
    "the space of operators @xmath26 decomposes into orthogonal sectors , with one sector for each combination of subsystems , and we say that @xmath37 contains an interaction among some subset of qudits if @xmath37 has a nonzero component in the corresponding sector .",
    "qualitatively , we say that a hamiltonian is local when relatively few combinations of subsystems are interacting .",
    "( note that we use  local operator \" to refer to an operator that is local to a single subsystem or collection of subsystems , while we use  local hamiltonian \" to refer to a sum of such operators . ) for instance , the ising model only exhibits nearest - neighbor interactions , as do lattice - regularized quantum field theories without higher derivatives .",
    "meanwhile , other models like spin glasses and matrix models exhibit interactions among all particles , but only in groups of fixed size , like two or four .",
    "likewise , non - relativistic electrons have only pairwise interactions , if each electron is treated as a subsystem .. ]    to incorporate all these notions of locality , one can use a hypergraph .",
    "first , note that an ordinary graph can be thought of as a collection of vertices @xmath75 , along with a collection of edges @xmath76 , where each edge is written as a pair of vertices , @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "we emphasize that each @xmath79 , called an  edge , \" is a two element subset of @xmath75 .",
    "a hypergraph is like an ordinary graph with a set @xmath75 of vertices , but the  edges \" @xmath80 may contain more than two vertices . for convenience , we subsequently refer to a hypergraph as a graph . given a fixed tps and hamiltonian , the associated  interaction graph \" has vertices corresponding to the subsystems and has ( hyper-)edges corresponding to every combination of subsystems that interact under the hamiltonian .",
    "we say that the hamiltonian is local with respect to some graph @xmath81 if its interaction graph is a subgraph @xmath81 .    given a hamiltonian @xmath37 , different choices of tps @xmath20",
    "will give rise to different operators @xmath66 on @xmath39 , with different associated interaction graphs .",
    "we are interested in tps s which give rise to interaction graphs with edges connecting only a small number of sites . as one measure of sparsity or locality , we say that a graph is @xmath8-local if it has edges joining at most @xmath8 vertices .- particle first quantized quantum system , @xmath8-locality with respect to particle subsystems means that the particles only have @xmath8-body interactions .",
    "] likewise , we call a hamiltonian @xmath8-local with respect to some tps if the associated graph is @xmath8-local , and we will also refer to the tps as @xmath8-local .    while the study of generic @xmath8-local hamiltonians is important ,- particle first quantized quantum system with @xmath8-body interactions is @xmath8-local with respect to particle subsystems . ] for example in the study of quantum circuits and black holes , generally we are interested in the stronger condition of geometric locality .",
    "this means that each site has edges connecting it to only a small number of other sites .",
    "for example , we are often interested in graphs which form a @xmath69-dimensional lattice with only neighboring lattice sites interacting . such graphs are ubiquitous since they arise in any local spin system or lattice regularization of quantum field theory .",
    "we might even make further constraints such as requiring that the hamiltonian be translation - invariant with respect to the lattice .",
    "all of the analytic results in this paper will be valid for generic hamiltonians within any specified locality class , including all the classes discussed above . specifically , we prove results about the number of duals within a particular locality class of a generic hamiltonian in that same locality class .",
    "for example , we can prove results about the number of translation - invariant duals of a generic translation - invariant hamiltonian .",
    "it is harder to prove results about the number of @xmath8-local duals of generic translation - invariant hamiltonians , since translation - invariant geometrically local hamiltonians are a measure zero subspace of the larger space of @xmath8-local hamiltonians .",
    "however in section [ sec : numerics ] we show that some of our results can be extended to such cases .",
    "first we ask whether a generic hamiltonian has any @xmath8-local tps .",
    "the answer is no , as will be demonstrated .",
    "we restrict our attention to a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath11 , @xmath82 , with hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "we ask whether there exists a tps with @xmath68 subsystems such that the hamiltonian is @xmath8-local . for @xmath68",
    "sufficiently larger than @xmath8 , we will see that a @xmath8-local tps exists only for a measure zero set of operators in @xmath26 .",
    "recall from the previous section that for a given hamiltonian @xmath37 , a choice of tps @xmath20 produces a hamiltonian @xmath66 on @xmath63 , up to local unitaries and permutations of subsystems .",
    "the operator @xmath66 then defines some associated interaction graph , up to relabeling of vertices .",
    "we call the tps @xmath20 @xmath8-local if it gives rise to a @xmath8-local interaction graph for @xmath66",
    ".    note that for any tps @xmath20 , @xmath37 and @xmath66 have the same spectrum .",
    "conversely , if there is some operator @xmath14 on @xmath63 with the same spectrum as @xmath37 , then there exists a tps @xmath83 such that @xmath84 .",
    "so @xmath37 has a @xmath8-local tps if and only if there is a @xmath8-local hamiltonian on @xmath63 with the same spectrum .",
    "the above observation allows a change of perspective , as suggested at the end of section [ sec : tps ] . rather than asking whether generic hamiltonians on an abstract hilbert space @xmath11 have some @xmath8-local tps , we can equivalently ask whether generic hamiltonians on @xmath63 are isospectral to some @xmath8-local hamiltonian .",
    "a simple dimension - counting argument yields the answer .",
    "the space of possible spectra of all hamiltonians is @xmath85 .",
    "meanwhile , examining eqn .",
    "( [ locham1 ] ) , we see that the space of @xmath8-local hamiltonians on @xmath63 will have dimension @xmath86 for @xmath68 subsystems of local dimension @xmath69",
    ". then the space of spectra of @xmath8-local hamiltonians will also have dimension at most @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath88 , the space of all spectra of @xmath8-local hamiltonians will have positive codimension in the space of all possible spectra .",
    "so for any sufficiently large @xmath68 ( e.g. @xmath89 , for @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , the set of hamiltonians that are isospectral to a @xmath8-local hamiltonian has measure zero .",
    "in general , the results in this paper will apply to all hamiltonians in some specified subspace , excluding an exceptional set of measure zero . on the other hand , when asking questions of an approximate nature  for instance , when asking whether a generic hamiltonian has a tps that is _ approximately _ local  the relevant question is not quite  does the exceptional set have measure zero ? \" but rather  what is the volume of an @xmath92-neighborhood of the exceptional set ? \"",
    "such questions are more difficult to tackle directly , requiring analysis to augment the linear algebra and algebraic geometry used in this paper .",
    "however , the exceptional sets in question not only have measure zero but also have a codimension that is exponential in the system size , perhaps suggesting that the desired results about @xmath92-neighborhoods would hold .",
    "now we ask , given a hamiltonian @xmath37 with some @xmath8-local tps @xmath20 , is @xmath20 the unique @xmath8-local tps , up to equivalence in the sense of section [ sec : tps ] above ?",
    "we again follow the strategy of reformulating the question on the space @xmath63 , using the observation at the end of section [ sec : tps ] .",
    "recall that two @xmath8-local hamitonians on @xmath63 are called dual if they are isospectral and are not related by local unitaries , permutations of subsystems , or transposition .",
    "now we can reformulate the question of whether a @xmath8-local tps for a hamiltonian is generically unique .",
    "the question becomes , does a generic @xmath8-local hamiltonian @xmath37 on @xmath63 have any duals ?",
    "in other words , can one generically recover a local hamiltonian from its spectrum ?",
    "posed in the latter terms , the question may be interesting for independent reasons .",
    "however , we are motivated by the original question , asking whether a @xmath8-local tps for a hamiltonian is generically unique .",
    "one s initial intuition may suggest that a @xmath8-local hamiltonian may indeed be recovered from its spectrum .",
    "this intuition is due to dimension counting : a @xmath8-local hamiltonian is specified by a number of parameters polynomial in @xmath68 , while the number of eigenvalues is exponential in @xmath68 . in the previous section , this dimension counting was used to rigorously demonstrate that generic hamiltonians have no @xmath8-local tps .",
    "however , the argument here is less immediate .",
    "while the spectrum has more parameters than the hamiltonian , this fact alone does not prevent generic hamiltonians from having duals .",
    "for instance , imagine that we slightly modified the question , instead defining two @xmath8-local hamiltonians to be dual whenever they are not related by local unitaries or permutations , failing to include the possibility of transposition .",
    "then we would discover that all hamiltonians ( except real - symmetric ones ) have at least one dual , given by their transpose .",
    "thus it is not immediately obvious that most @xmath8-local hamiltonians do not have duals .",
    "however , transposition , just like local unitaries and permutations , is a linear map on the space of hamiltonians , and it preserves the subspace of local hamiltonians . a simple check , after dimension - counting , is to ask whether there are any _ other _ linear spectrum - preserving maps that preserve this subspace .",
    "it turns out that no such maps exist .",
    "all linear maps that preserve eigenvalues are generated by transposition and unitaries , and since we already know that taking the transpose preserves locality , we only have to worry about whether other unitaries preserve the subspace .",
    "the proof that the only such unitaries are 1-local or permutations is relatively simple .",
    "suppose there exists a unitary @xmath40 which preserves the space of @xmath8-local hamiltonians and which is not generated by 1-local unitaries and permutations .",
    "then there must be some site @xmath74 whose local hermitian operators are mapped to hermitian operators that sometimes involve at least 2 sites , otherwise it would be generated by 1-local unitaries and permutations .",
    "since it preserves @xmath8-locality , any @xmath8-local operator must be mapped to at most @xmath8 sites .",
    "now consider two sets of @xmath8 sites , whose intersection is only site @xmath74 .",
    "each are mapped to at most @xmath8 sites , which must both contain the two sites to which @xmath74 is mapped .",
    "therefore any operator involving only those @xmath93 sites must be mapped to an operator on only @xmath94 sites . by dimension counting",
    "it is impossible for this to be true for an invertible map , which gives a contradiction .",
    "this proof generalizes to other notions of locality , e.g.  the subspace of local lattice hamiltonians for some fixed lattice .      as discussed above",
    ", we would like to show that generic @xmath8-local hamiltonians do not have @xmath8-local duals .",
    "however , the statements proven in this paper will be weaker statements . more specifically",
    ", our result will apply to any particular linear subspace of hamiltonians , for a hilbert space of fixed size .",
    "for instance , consider the subspace of all @xmath8-local hamiltonians on @xmath68 qubits .",
    "the result then states : if there exists a single example of a @xmath8-local hamiltonian on @xmath68 qubits without any duals , then almost all @xmath8-local hamiltonians on @xmath68 qubits do not have @xmath8-local duals .",
    "the analogous result applies to systems of qudits rather than qubits ( i.e. using @xmath69-dimensional subsystems )",
    ". or , for instance , consider the linear subspace of all hamiltonians on spin chains with nearest - neighbor couplings .",
    "then the result states : if there exists a single example of a spin chain hamiltonian on @xmath68 spins without any duals that are also spin chains , then the same must hold for almost all spin chain hamiltonians on @xmath68 spins .",
    "of course , these results on their own do not guarantee that almost all @xmath8-local hamiltonians do not have duals .",
    "however , as a proof of principle , we will numerically find an example of a translation - invariant spin chain hamiltonian on 10 spins that does not have any translation - invariant spin chain duals .",
    "combined with the above result , the numerical example effectively proves that almost all translation - invariant spin chain hamiltonians on 10 spins do not have any translation - invariant spin chain duals .",
    "if a family of examples could be generated analytically for systems of different sizes , perhaps using induction in the size of the system , then our result would imply rigorously that almost all @xmath8-local hamiltonians do not have duals .",
    "we suspect that such examples exist , which would imply that the general result holds .",
    "now we begin to formalize the statement .",

    "note that @xmath105 the statement that @xmath37 has no duals is the statement that @xmath106 this condition says that the only hamiltonians in @xmath96 isospectral to @xmath37 are those related by local unitary operations , permutations of qubits , and the transpose operation .",
    "equivalently , the condition states @xmath97 is uniquely determined by its spectrum , up to the previous operations .",

    "we then simply need to show that @xmath205 is smooth at @xmath37 .",

    " we can then arrange the physical algebra into mutually commuting subalgebras associated with spatial regions .",
    "this general notion is captured by a ",

    "the map @xmath300 is injective .",
    "this definition is similar to that used by @xcite . in the context of a net of observables ,",
    "a local hamiltonian would be one that may be written as a sum of terms in @xmath301 for small regions @xmath40 , perhaps where @xmath96 has the additional structure of a geometric lattice .    as a simple example of a net of observables , consider a hilbert space @xmath302 with an ordinary tps .",
    "then the naturally associated net of observables would be defined by @xmath303 for @xmath304 . however , the purpose of defining a net of observables is that not all nets must be associated with explicit tensor factorizations of @xmath11 .",
    "for instance , given a fermionic theory on a lattice , we would define @xmath301 to be generated by products of even numbers of fermion creation and annihilation operators .",
    "then @xmath305 , i.e. only fermion - even operators are considered physical , and the hilbert space has no natural tps .    like fermionic theories",
    ", gauge theories also lack an ordinary tps , at least when restricting to the  physical \" hilbert space .",
    "but , like fermionic theories , the local structure of gauge theories is suitably generalized by using a net of observables instead . for simplicity , consider two - dimensional @xmath306-lattice gauge theory .",
    "the full ,  unphysical \" hilbert space is the tensor product of qubit degrees of freedom living on the edges of a square lattice .",
    "so the full hilbert @xmath307 space is endowed with a natural tps .",
    "however , the physical hilbert @xmath308 is the proper subspace gauge - invariant physical states , and the physical observables @xmath26 consist of gauge - invariant observables on @xmath307 , restricted to the gauge - invariant subspace . in general",
    ", a subspace of a space with an explicit tps will not inherit the tps in any natural way , so the physical hilbert space will not have a natural tps . on the other hand",
    ", we can construct a net of observables by defining @xmath309 to be the algebra of gauge - invariant observables , with @xmath301 the algebra of gauge - invariant observables local to @xmath40 .",
    "gauge theory does not have the property that @xmath310 for disjoint regions @xmath298 , which would be true for any theory with an ordinary tps , showing that an ordinary tps would not have sufficed to capture the local structure of the theory .",
    "we have seen that nets of observables provide a generalized notion of tps sufficient to capture the local structure of fermions and gauge theory .",
    "do the uniqueness results at the heart of this paper generalize to theories whose local structure is described by a net of observables , rather than a strict tps ? that is , given an abstract hilbert space and hamiltonian , we can ask whether there exists a net of observables on the hilbert space such that the hamiltonian is local . and then , given that such a net exists , we can ask whether it is unique .",
    "questions about nets are harder to tackle than the analogous questions about ordinary tps s .",
    "to see why , let us reconsider a nuance in the discussion of ordinary tps s that we have not addressed .",
    "given some local system of qubits , rather than simply asking whether the system has a dual using a different set of qubit degrees of freedom , we might ask whether there is a dual using qudits .",
    "that is , we may want to consider duals that use different  types \" of tps s . up to unitary equivalence , a tps on a hilbert space is just characterized by the list of dimensions of the subsystems , and these must multiply to the total dimension , so it is easy to characterize the  types \" of tps s : qubits , or qutrits , or some combination , etc .",
    "meanwhile , there are many more types of nets .",
    "indeed , on a given hilbert space , there are more possible nets of observables , even up to unitary equivalence .",
    "the net corresponding to fermions is different than the net corresponding to gauge theory , because they use different sorts of algebras @xmath301 , and one could construct nets that do not obviously correspond to bosons , fermions , or gauge theories .",
    "the harder question then becomes : given some hamiltonian @xmath37 that looks local using a given net , does @xmath37 have any duals that not only use different local degrees of freedom but also use a different type of net ?    while the above questions are certainly difficult , the following observation suggests they may tractable .",
    "we already know the types of tps are easy to characterize , controlled by the dimension of the hilbert space . given some fixed @xmath311 , the tps can not have too many subsystems , assuming each subsystem has dimension greater than one .",
    "the types of nets are similarly controlled .",
    "as long as one assumes that the algebra @xmath301 is non - trivial for any region @xmath40 larger than some fixed size , then condition ( 4 ) in the definition of a net ensures that @xmath311 will be exponential in the number of sites .",
    "so for given hilbert space @xmath11 , a net can not be constructed with more sites than about @xmath312 , offering some control on the types of nets allowed .",
    "none of the results in this paper directly apply to infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "there are three types of infinities to consider . first",
    ", a theory with non - hardcore bosons will have infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces at each lattice site .",
    "second , in the continuum limit , there are infinitely many lattice sites per fixed volume , associated with uv divergences .",
    "third , in the large system limit , there are infinitely many lattice sites at fixed spacing .",
    "the large - system limit alone may yield interesting complications when attempting to reproduce the finite - dimensional results .",
    "the discussion in section [ sec : main ] relies essentially on the well - behavedness of the map from a hamiltonian to its spectrum .",
    "however , in the large - system limit , the eigenvalues may vary non - analytically with respect to the hamiltonian , leading famously to phase transitions .",
    "another result of non - analyticity is that properties which are true generically for finite - size systems may not be true generic infinite - size systems .",
    "for instance ,",
    "finite - size local hamiltonians are generically non - degenerate ; that is , a random local perturbation of a degenerate local hamiltonian will break the degeneracy .",
    "but certain infinite - size lattice systems have topological order , with a ground state degeneracy that is robust to any local perturbation .",
    "in particular , there exist open neighborhoods in the space of infinite two - dimensional lattice hamiltonians such that all hamiltonians in the neighborhood have degenerate spectrum .",
    "therefore , one can not navely rule out the possibility that there exists a region of nonzero volume in the space of infinite - size local hamiltonians where the hamiltonians all have duals .",
    "we began by formally defining a tensor product structure ( tps ) on a hilbert space , allowing one to pose clear questions about the existence of tps s for which a hamiltonian is local .",
    "first we observed that for some fixed hamiltonian @xmath37 , questions about the existence of a tps in which @xmath37 is local may be translated into questions about the existence of local hamiltonians with the same spectrum as @xmath37 . with this perspective , we showed that almost all hamiltonians do _ not _ have any tps for which the hamiltonian is local .",
    "equivalently , generic hamiltonians are not isospectral to any local hamiltonian .",
    "on the other hand , physical systems are distinguished by the property that they _ are _ local in some tps , or at least approximately so .",
    "we therefore considered hamiltonians known to have some local tps and argued that the local tps is generically unique .",
    "equivalently , a generic local hamiltonian is uniquely determined by its spectrum .",
    "put a third way , generic local hamiltonians do not have  duals . \"",
    "the argument for this claim involves two parts : first , we proved that if there exists a single example of a local hamiltonian without any duals , then almost all local hamiltonians have no duals .",
    "second , we found numerical examples of local hamiltonians for small systems that do not have any duals , effectively proving that almost all hamiltonians on these systems do not have any duals .",
    "we speculated that these results may be extended to arbitrarily large finite - dimensional systems , with the possibility of interesting subtleties in the infinite - size limit .",
    "finally , we presented a generalization of a tps , suitable for fermions and gauge theories .",
    "further generalizations discussed below address situations where only a subspace of the full hilbert space is equipped with a tps , perhaps with relevance to the bulk side of holographic theories .",
    "in this paper we argue that given the spectrum of a hamiltonian that is local in some tps , then generically the local tps is uniquely determined .",
    "in fact , one can also determine the local tps by merely knowing the time evolution of a single generic state in the hilbert space , without otherwise knowing @xmath37 .",
    "the time evolution of a generic state @xmath313 has the form @xmath314 for each of the eigenstates @xmath315 with energy @xmath316 . taking the fourier transform of @xmath317 with respect to time",
    ", we can determine the spectrum and hence the local tps .",
    "however , even with a known tps , much remains to be understood about the unitary evolution of states .",
    "much research is dedicated to the subject of expressing the wavefunction as a sum of decoherent classical branches @xcite .",
    "this research generally assumes the existence of some underlying tps and it has been recognized that it would be preferable to have the tps emerge naturally in the same way as the branches @xcite ; our results suggest a way to do that .      given both a low - energy state and a tps , recent work @xcite suggests one can construct a metric on the discrete sites of the tps .",
    "the distance assigned between sites is dictated by the mutual information between the subsystems , giving a  geometry \" that depends on the state .",
    "it would be possible to combine this approach with the work in this paper , determining both a tps _ and _ a notion of distance between subsystems , starting from just the spectrum .",
    "first one determines the most local tps , then finds the ground state of the hamiltonian with respect to that tps , and finally uses the mutual information of the ground state to define distances between subsystems .    in this paper",
    ", we already associate a graph to the tps , based on which sites are directly interacting under the hamiltonian .",
    "the graph approximately describes the topological structure of the space , while the proposal of @xcite would assign lengths to the edges of the graph , upgrading the topological data to geometric data .",
    "however , when the hamiltonian is already known , it may be more natural to rely on dynamical notions of distance like the light - cone or butterfly velocity , rather than asking about the mutual information of a state at fixed time .",
    "recent progress has been made on the construction of universal quantum simulators @xcite .",
    "in particular , consider a finite lattice system in @xmath69 spatial dimensions , governed by local hamiltonian @xmath37 on hilbert space @xmath11 . then one can always construct a local , two - dimensional spin system with hamiltonian @xmath99 on hilbert space @xmath318 , such that the low energy subspace of @xmath99 reproduces the spectrum of @xmath37 with arbitrary precision .",
    "because the simulator requires many auxiliary degrees of freedom , the number of lattice sites used in @xmath318 will be larger than the number of sites present in the original system @xmath11 , so @xmath319 and the systems are not dual in the strict sense used above .",
    "however , one might consider the notion of a tps for a subspace of the full hilbert space .",
    "restricting attention to the low energy subspace of the device , one could in principle find the tps corresponding to the simulated system .",
    "this situation may be analogous to the ads / cft duality in which the tps of the bulk gravity theory only describes a subspace of the full hilbert space .",
    "this is further discussed in section [ sec : qg ] below .      until now",
    ", we have avoided the question of why to prefer one tps over another .",
    "instead , we have simply asserted that we are interested in tps s for which dynamics appear local .",
    "if one treats the wavefunction and its hamiltonian without any preferred basis as the only fundamental data of a quantum system , then _ a priori _ all tps s are equally valid descriptions of the system .",
    ", the radical view would suggest that the tps of the simulated system has the same ontological status as the tps of the simulation device . ]    because the world around us has local interactions , it is natural that we are interested in tps s with local dynamics .",
    "however , one might ask why our experience privileges a particular tps for the universe  namely , the tps associated with spatial degrees of freedom ?",
    "one possible answer is that local interactions are an essential ingredient for localized observers .",
    "for contrast , consider some randomly chosen tps , in which interactions are non - local .",
    "a hypothetical observer  localized \" in this tps will quickly become delocalized , so perhaps observers in such a tps can not exist for extended periods . instead , only a tps with local dynamics can naturally describe localized observers , and their experience will privilege that local tps .    the existence of localized observers may also require more than just a local tps .",
    "for example , even local interactions may be strongly coupled and chaotic , such that localized objects quickly become maximally entangled with their environment .",
    "one might expect that such dynamics do not allow localized observers , because such observers would quickly become delocalized despite having only local interactions .",
    "a measure of entanglement growth was considered in @xcite as a criterion for choosing a tps , though the author restricted the analysis to tps s related by bogoliubov transformations .",
    "when searching for a tps with slow entanglement growth , one must decide for which class of states to consider the entanglement .",
    "one possibility is to consider random product states @xcite , while another natural choice would be low - energy states .",
    "the computational complexity of a unitary operator  the number of local quantum gates needed to contstruct the operator  is an important notion in quantum information theory and features in discussions of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the complexity of an operator depends crucially on the choice of tps .",
    "given a fixed tps , random unitary operators will have complexity that is exponential in system size , as demonstrated by a dimension - counting argument .",
    "moreover , by an argument similar to that of section [ sec : existence ] , generic unitary operators will have no tps in which they have low complexity .",
    "however , if a hamiltonian is local in some tps , the time - evolution operator @xmath320 will have much smaller complexity in that tps , at least for times sub - exponential in the system size . because the locality of @xmath37 determines the growth rate of complexity of @xmath320 , at least for sufficiently small times , an alternate description of the local tps is the tps in which @xmath320 has minimal complexity at small times .",
    "the most well - known of the dualities in quantum gravity is the ads / cft correspondence between strongly coupled @xmath321 super yang - mills in @xmath322dimensions ( the boundary theory ) and weakly coupled quantum gravity in @xmath323 ( the bulk theory ) @xcite .",
    "this duality is unlikely to satisfy the precise definition of duality used in this paper , even using the generalization of section [ sec : gauge ] . in particular ,",
    "the tps in the bulk is only defined for a subspace of states of the complete hilbert space .",
    "these are states associated with small perturbations of the geometry around a flat ads background @xcite .",
    "however , when the state contains a black hole , for example , it does not make sense to talk about the same approximately - local degrees of freedom that existed in flat space .",
    "the discrepancy is especially manifest in tensor network toy models of ads / cft , where the model of a black hole involves tearing out tensors from the network @xcite .",
    "this model completely removes some of the bulk lattice sites , and instead the ` correct ' tps for the subspace of states containing the black hole consists of the remaining bulk sites , together with new lattice sites at the boundary of the black hole . describing different subsets of states in the hilbert space with different tps s in a coherent way seems to require yet another generalization tensor product structures .",
    "the question of whether the boundary theory or bulk theory is  more local `` is somewhat subtle .",
    "the bulk gravitational theory will necessarily have small non - local interactions , but it also has far fewer degrees of freedom at each  lattice site '' than does the boundary theory , where there is a large @xmath324 matrix of operators associated to each site .",
    "the bulk tps has a much smaller algebra of local operators , since it divides the hilbert space up into much smaller subsystems .",
    "one might therefore describe the bulk tps as more local than the boundary tps when considering the low energy subspace , even though the hamiltonian is only approximately local with respect to the bulk tps .        a toy model for ads / cft",
    ", the sachdev - ye - kitaev model @xcite , is particularly relevant to the discussions in this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian of the theory is comprised of @xmath113 majorana fermions @xmath325 with all - to - all @xmath326-local coupling terms - local , it is completely geometrically non - local , with every site interacting with every other site . ] : @xmath327 the coefficients @xmath328 are sampled from i.i.d .",
    "random gaussians , describing an ensemble of hamiltonians .",
    "since this ensemble is the fermionic analog of a class of bosonic local hamiltonians considered in this paper , we might expect that generic syk hamiltonians would not have any local duals . on the other hand ,",
    "when one disorder - averages the syk hamiltonian and takes the expectation of observables over the probability distribution for @xmath329 , one can remarkably rewrite the theory in terms of degrees of freedom that include a type of einstein - dilaton gravity in @xmath330 dimensions @xcite . as a consequence , one can compute the spectrum of the bulk gravity theory by computing the spectrum of the majorana theory ( in a particular limit ) , which is comparatively easier to treat @xcite .    in accordance with our intuition , it is likely that the complete description of the dynamics is not even approximately local at scales smaller than the 1 + 1d ads scale .",
    "nonetheless , it is interesting that this alternative description is able to exist at all , when the hamiltonian itself is generic within some class of local hamiltonians .",
    "there are many open questions about whether our results extend to the generalized notion of tps suitable for fermions and gauge theories discussed in section [ sec : gauge ] , as well as to infinite - dimensional systems or approximately local tps s . furthermore , while we have provided evidence that recovery of the tps from the spectrum of spin chains is generically possible in principle , we have not discussed practical measures to determine whether a local tps exists for a given spectrum or how to find it apart from numerically searching through possible tps s .",
    "it appears that finding the most local tps for a given spectrum is computationally impractical ( using classical computation ) for all but the smallest hilbert spaces , but it is possible that there may be very good heuristic algorithms .",
    "it would be interesting if there was , in contrast , an efficient quantum algorithm to find local tps s .",
