    "the first imaging observations of galaxies beyond our local group were conducted by the _ einstein _",
    "observatory in the period 1978 - 1981 , and revealed a somewhat unexpected result : many galaxies hosted one or more extra - nuclear sources with x - ray luminosities well in excess of those typically observed in our own galaxy and its nearest neighbours @xcite . at the time it was rather presciently",
    "acknowledged that if these were individual x - ray sources , their x - ray luminosity was difficult to explain without invoking massive black holes , or super - eddington emission @xcite .",
    "throughout the 1990s the _ rosat _ mission observed hundreds of nearby galaxies , detecting many more of these sources @xcite .",
    "these observations revealed little of the actual nature of these objects , except that a fraction can be associated with recent supernovae , for example sn 1986j in ngc 891 @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent analysis of samples of these objects has given us some insights into their demographics , for example with estimates of between only 1 in 8 and 1 in 4 major galaxies hosting one of these x - ray bright objects with an observed luminosity in excess of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "* it is this extreme luminosity threshold , in combination with an extra - nuclear location , that we use to define this class of so - called `` ultraluminous x - ray sources '' ( ulxs)*.    a clearer insight into the nature of the majority of ulxs was provided by _ asca _",
    "observations in the years around 2000 .",
    "most notably , the novel wide bandpass ccd spectroscopy afforded by _",
    "asca _ allowed the spectra of many ulxs to be measured over the @xmath2 kev range for the first time .",
    "this revealed some of them to be well - fitted by the multi - colour disc blackbody model , that describes the optically - thick thermal x - ray emission of an accretion disc around a black hole @xcite .",
    "additionally , multi - epoch observations of some ulxs saw them apparently transiting between spectral states described by either the multi - colour disc blackbody model or a power - law , similar to the transition between low- and high - states seen in galactic black hole x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "this gave the first strong corroborating evidence - on top of their extraordinary luminosities - that most ulxs are accreting black holes .",
    "however , these results were not without problems , notably that the disc temperatures measured by @xcite were far too hot to be reconciled with the masses suggested by the high luminosities of the sources ( see below ) .",
    "it was suggested that this could be explained by rapidly spinning ( kerr metric ) black holes , in which the inner edge of the accretion discs are far closer to the black hole - and therefore hotter - than in the non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) case .",
    "our understanding of the nature of ulxs has increased immensely over the last @xmath3 half decade due to the excellent capabilities of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories , and follow - up studies across the range of the electromagnetic spectrum . in this paper",
    "we mainly concentrate on contributions to the understanding of ulxs garnered from spectroscopic and timing studies using the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) on _ xmm - newton_. however , first we will summarise some of the main arguments relating to the nature of ulxs .",
    "the eddington limit for the maximum radiative luminosity possible from the spherical accretion of matter on to a black hole can be expressed as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the mass of the accreting object in solar masses @xcite .",
    "hence , for an object obeying the eddington limit , at a luminosity of @xmath0 its mass must be @xmath6 . for an accretion rate of @xmath7 per cent of",
    "that required to reach the eddington limit - a fairly typical accretion rate for a high - state black hole - this means that a @xmath8 black hole is required for the source to be emitting at @xmath9 .",
    "* so , if ulxs obey the eddington limit , they must contain massive black holes . * but how massive ?",
    "dynamical friction arguments imply that these sources can not be misplaced super - massive black holes , sitting outside the nuclei of the host galaxies , as such massive objects should sink to the centre of the galaxies in a hubble time @xcite .",
    "however , the eddington limit argument also rules out the stellar remnant black holes that we know of in our own galaxy , with masses in the range @xmath10 @xcite , for all but the mildest of ulxs ( @xmath11 at the eddington limit ) . indeed ,",
    "@xcite calculate that the vast majority of black holes formed from the evolution of a single massive star will have mass @xmath12 , clearly inadequate to power the brighter end of the ulx population ( if obeying the eddington limit ) . ) to collapse directly to a massive black hole .",
    "however such objects would be comparatively rare . ]",
    "these limits led to the suggestion that ulxs may be the first observational evidence for a new , @xmath13 _ intermediate - mass _ class of accreting black holes ( imbhs ) @xcite ( see also @xcite for more on imbhs ) .",
    "the strongest supporting evidence in favour of imbhs in ulxs comes from the high signal - to - noise broad - band x - ray spectroscopy enabled by _ xmm - newton_. in particular , @xcite showed that the spectra of two ulxs in ngc 1313 could be well fitted by the same absorbed multi - colour disc blackbody plus power - law continuum model that is commonly used as the empirical model to fit galactic black hole binaries , with the key difference being a lower disc temperature in ulxs than galactic black holes ( 0.1  0.3 kev versus @xmath14 kev , respectively ) .",
    "this is crucial because , for a fixed accretion rate , the temperature of the inner edge of a standard accretion disc scales with the black hole mass as @xmath15 , i.e. a cooler disc implies a bigger black hole . in fact , the black hole masses for the ulxs in ngc 1313 were estimated to be of the order @xmath16 .",
    "many ulx spectra were quickly shown to agree with this result @xcite , with @xcite demonstrating that such sources lie in a different region of disc luminosity - disc temperature space than galactic black holes , emphasizing their potentially different natures .",
    "other factors also argue for the presence of imbhs in at least some ulxs .",
    "for example , x - ray timing characteristics such as the detection of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the x - ray fluctuation power spectral densities ( psds ) of some ulxs argue that their emission is isotropic , supportive of imbhs assuming that the eddington limit is not exceeded ( see section  [ sec:2 ] for more details ) . similarly , simple photon counting arguments for high - excitation optical line emission regions near ulxs make the same argument @xcite .",
    "the source for which most evidence stacks up is m82 x-1 , which through a combination of its extreme luminosity ( @xmath17 ) , co - location with the young , dense stellar cluster mgg 11 , and qpo detections is the best known candidate for an imbh @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible this source is an atypical ulx ; it may be the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , ulxs as a population are not trivially explained by the presence of imbhs .",
    "there are in fact many arguments as to why the majority of ulxs can not be imbhs , or at least imbhs of the size inferred from cool accretion discs ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "two arguments stand out as the principle reasons the ulx population is not dominated by ( large ) accreting imbhs .",
    "firstly , the luminosity function of x - ray sources in galaxies ( xlf ) has an unbroken power - law form for 5 decades up to a luminosity of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this break occurs at @xmath7 per cent of the eddington luminosity for the @xmath16 black holes inferred from ulx spectroscopy .",
    "this is extremely troublesome for a ulx population dominated by these large imbhs , as they would not only have to contrive to take over the xlf smoothly from galactic black holes at @xmath19 , but then cease accreting at 10 per cent of eddington .",
    "no other accreting source class behaves in this manner .",
    "this instead argues that ulxs are dominated by black holes of mass up to @xmath20 ( or less if the eddington limit can be exceeded ) .",
    "the second strong argument against imbhs comes from the association of ulxs with star formation .",
    "early observations with _",
    "chandra _ revealed that starburst galaxies have populations of multiple ulxs @xcite , an unusual result given the expectation of less than one in four galaxies on average possessing even one ulx .",
    "the obvious conclusion from this is that the ulxs are intrinsically linked to the ongoing star formation occuring in those galaxies .",
    "however , the direct co - location of ulxs with the star formation , most notably seen in the cartwheel galaxy @xcite , implies that they must be ( relatively ) short - lived , which requires successive generations of ulxs to be formed over the duration of the star formation event .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if these ulxs were all large imbhs , then an infeasibly large proportion of the available star forming mass would end up in the form of imbhs .",
    "hence the majority of ulxs in star forming regions can not be powered by imbhs .",
    "if ulxs in starburst galaxies are not imbhs , then what are they ?",
    "the obvious solution is to turn to a class of objects we would expect to find there anyway : high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the problem then becomes one of making such objects appear as ulxs . assuming galactic black hole masses for these objects ( i.e. @xmath21 ) one then needs to either make such objects _ actually _ break the eddington limit , or to make them _ apparently _",
    "exceed it .",
    "lower - luminosity and/or eddington - limited objects could appear as bright ulxs due to beaming , either through relativistic boosting of their x - ray emission along our line - of - sight @xcite or through collimation of their radiation - probably by a geometrically - thick accretion disc - such that it only escapes into a fraction of the sky @xcite .",
    "alternatively , models have been suggested whereby actual super - eddington luminosities are achieved and maintained , at factors @xmath22 above the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "regardless of the processes involved , a very basic requirement of most models is that sufficient fuel is available for the super - eddington mass transfer rates needed in ulxs .",
    "@xcite show that this is indeed the case for high - mass x - ray binary systems containing a stellar - mass black hole and a massive donor star , that can in fact sustain super - eddington mass transfer over a very large fraction of their lifetimes .",
    "other authors suggest that the possible hyper - eddington mass transfer rates in ss 433-like objects fuel ulxs @xcite .",
    "furthermore , where optical stellar counterparts to ulxs have been identified , primarily by _ hst _ , they tend to be blue and of an appropriate magnitude for the young , massive stars required to fuel ulxs @xcite .",
    "this provides compelling support to the argument that ulxs are high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "finally , it is reassuring to know that the eddington limit is broken in practise in galactic black holes - @xcite give several examples , most notably that of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "this source is sufficiently luminous ( at @xmath19 ) to appear as a ulx if viewed from outside our galaxy , and ( for its known black hole mass ) has consistently displayed peak luminosities in excess of the eddington limit over the @xmath23 years of its outburst to date @xcite . as the eddington limit is exceeded in known sources , there is no reason this can not also be occuring in ulxs .",
    "we are therefore left with the situation where most ulxs could be explained by stellar - mass black holes that are either super - eddington , or subject to some sort of beaming .",
    "however , it is still difficult to reconcile the most extreme ulxs - those above @xmath24 - with simple stellar - mass black hole systems .",
    "larger black holes would still provide an obvious solution . but are they really the @xmath16 black holes inferred from ulx spectroscopy ?",
    "as we have already discussed , the strongest support for ulxs containing imbhs comes from x - ray spectroscopy , and in particular the good fits obtained to ulx spectra using the same multi - colour disc plus power - law continuum model used for galactic black holes . to date",
    "more than 10 ulxs with decent _ xmm - newton _ spectra have been shown to have their spectral fits improved substantially ( compared to , say , a simple absorbed power - law model ) by the use of this model , in many cases producing a statistically acceptable fit to the data .",
    "an ubiquitous feature of these fits is a cool disc which , as we have already seen , when interpreted at face value implies the presence of an imbh with mass of the order @xmath16 .",
    "but should we take this mass at face value ?",
    "there is good reason not to .",
    "the mass estimates deriving from the multi - colour disc blackbody model assume that this is the dominant emission component in the x - ray spectrum ( essentially , that the black hole is in the `` high '' state ) .",
    "unfortunately , in ulxs fit by this `` imbh model '' ( which here specifically refers to an empirical model composed of a cool disc plus harder power - law ) it is very evidently not .",
    "we demonstrate this graphically for the imbh candidate ( @xmath25 ) ngc 1313 x-1 in fig  [ imbhmod ] , where it is obvious that the power - law dominates the flux within the _ xmm - newton _ bandpass .",
    "in fact , the disc typically emits no more than 20 per cent of the 0.3  10 kev flux of ulxs in this model @xcite .",
    "worse still , the power - law slopes measured by this model are somewhat on the low side for the classic high state ( @xmath26 for imbh models , compared to @xmath27 in galactic high state sources ; cf .",
    "this makes black hole masses obtained by this method ( at the very least ) questionable .",
    "kev ) and the power - law continuum ( @xmath28 ) are shown by blue ( dashed ) and red lines respectively . the x - ray emission detected by _ xmm - newton _",
    "is clearly dominated by the power - law component , and not the disc.,scaledwidth=33.0% ]    furthermore , the imbh model is not the only model that fits ulx spectra .",
    "several sources have been identified in which a variant of this model , where the disc component fits to the hard end of the spectrum , provides a far superior fit @xcite . as discussed by @xcite this variant of the empirical black hole spectrum model",
    "does not provide a physical model for the x - ray emission - for example there can not be sufficient photons present in the vicinity of the black hole to produce the dominant soft power - law through compton up - scattering .",
    "however , the crucial point is that there is distinct curvature ( which can also be described as a spectral `` break '' ) present above 2 kev in these data , for which there must be a physical explanation .      given the question marks about the imbh model , and this second , `` inverted '' model that fit to some ulxs , we set out to examine the best available _ xmm - newton _ ulx datasets ( from the beginning of 2005 ) .",
    "specifically , in @xcite we set out to ask the questions    * how easy is it to distinguish the imbh and inverted models given the available quality of data ? * with what frequency do these models work for the available data ?",
    "* can we say anything about the physics of the inverted model ?    to do this we selected data sets with at least a few thousand counts ( epic - pn and mos combined ) per ulx .",
    "we show examples of the low and high end of the data quality for ulxs in our sample in fig  [ specqual ] .",
    "the data was of sufficient quality to statistically rule out simple multi - colour disc blackbody fits to all the sources , and power - law continua in 8/13 cases .",
    "residuals for the fit shown in the bottom .",
    "the ulx in m83 was adequately fit by a power - law continuum , whereas m33 x-8 was not.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=33.0% ]   residuals for the fit shown in the bottom .",
    "the ulx in m83 was adequately fit by a power - law continuum , whereas m33 x-8 was not.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=33.0% ]    as simple models were inadequate for all but the poorest data , we next attempted empirical two - component models , beginning with the imbh model .",
    "this provided acceptable fits to 8/13 sources , which all had the classic @xmath29 kev cool disc signature .",
    "unfortunately , they all also displayed the problems inherent in mass measurements from this model , i.e. dominant , hard power - law continua .",
    "we then attempted fits using the inverted model .",
    "this also provided good fits to 8/13 data sets , parameterised by @xmath30 power - law photon indices , @xmath31 kev inner - disc temperatures , and a very roughly 50/50 split between the flux contribution of the two components in the _ xmm - newton _ band .",
    "interesting , the six lowest quality data sets provided acceptable fits to both models , demonstrating that either very high quality x - ray data , or a secondary diagnostic , is required to distinguish the models .",
    "this key diagnostic is found at energies above 2 kev , where disc - domination leads to distinct curvature in the spectrum , whereas a dominant power - law has an unbroken spectrum .",
    "we tested for this characteristic signature by comparing power - law fits to broken power - law fits on the @xmath32 kev data for each ulx . in total",
    "we found 8 ulxs showing evidence for breaks , at significance levels between @xmath33 .",
    "three of these were expected , as they were from sources clearly better fit by the inverted model .",
    "however , five sources that were either ambiguous or well - fitted by the imbh model also showed a significant break .",
    "of the remaining ( unbroken ) source fits , in three cases this may be attributable to very poor data quality above 2 kev .",
    "this simple test therefore demonstrates that spectral breaks are present in the majority of ulxs ( notably , across the whole range of luminosity ) where the data quality above 2 kev is sufficient to detect them .    in order to investigate the physics of this break further , we attempted spectral fits using a physically self - consistent accretion disc plus comptonised corona model , specifically using an absorbed diskpn + eqpair model in xspec . where appropriate",
    ", parameters were tied to assumed values ( based on experience with galactic systems ) , so that the model had only one more degree of freedom than the empirical ( two - component ) models , but sufficient scope for variation within the model parameters was allowed such that the outcomes were not pre - judged .",
    "this model gave superior fits to the empirical models , with 11/13 ulxs providing statistically - acceptable fits ( with one more only marginally unacceptable ) .",
    "two remarkable characteristics were common to most fits : firstly , the ulxs still showed apparently cool discs ; but secondly , the coronae ( in 9/12 cases ) appeared * optically - thick * ( with @xmath34 - in several cases much higher ) .",
    "it is this optical thickness in the corona that is responsible for the curvature in the 2 - 10 kev spectrum .",
    "furthermore , this distinguishes ulxs from galactic black holes , that do not _ typically _ show such coronae .",
    "the reason their coronae are empirically modelled by power - laws is that they are optically - thin .",
    "this therefore suggests ulxs are operating in a different accretion mode to the classic states of galactic black holes .",
    "so what is happening in these sources ?",
    "one physical scenario that could lead to the production of both a cool disc component and an optically - thick corona is suggested by @xcite , based on an analogy with the solar corona .",
    "this `` sandwich '' model consists of a cool inner accretion disc , seeding an outer , warm ( @xmath14 kev ) and optically - thick ( @xmath35 ) accretion disc layer with @xmath36 kev photons .",
    "this could readily provide both components we derive from our spectra , though the geometry required to see the cool photons through the warm layer is problematic .",
    "a second scenario is based on observations of a strongly - comptonised very high state observed in the galactic black hole xte j1550 - 564 by @xcite . in this source",
    "they also detect a cooler - than - expected disc , alongside an optically thick corona ( though neither phenomena are as extreme as detected in the ulxs ) , and suggest that this is due to energetic coupling of the inner - disc with the corona . in such a system , the energy released by the extreme accretion rate is sufficient to launch an optically - thick corona , which obscures ( and , through extracting the launch energy , cools ) the central regions of the disc .",
    "one therefore predominantly sees the cooler outer regions of the accretion disc , in addition to the optically - thick corona .",
    "as this state occurs at a very high accretion rate in xte j1550 - 564 , this suggests that ulxs operate at similar - or higher - accretion rates .",
    "this must be at around the eddington limit , suggestive of black hole masses up to @xmath37 .",
    "further work has now revealed this @xmath32 kev break in other ulxs - for example in m82 x-1 @xcite and ho",
    "ix x-1 ( aka m81 x-9 ) @xcite .",
    "other ideas have been also been postulated for its origin , and the full observed x - ray spectrum for ulxs .",
    "several authors have discussed ulxs in the context of slim disc models @xcite . in particular , they note that as the eddington limit is approached , the structure of the accretion disc should change .",
    "this would manifest itself as a change in the model disc profile , @xmath38 , where standard discs have @xmath39 , and slim discs @xmath40 .",
    "recent work where a variable disc profile model is fit to ulx spectra does indeed show values of @xmath41 , suggestive of slim discs @xcite .",
    "a second idea , put forward by @xcite , draws from observations of agns with outflows . in their model ulxs",
    "have an intrinsic very high state spectrum ( steep power - law form , i.e. @xmath42 ) , that is modified by absorption from material in an ionised fast outflow .",
    "this effectively takes a `` bite '' out of the spectrum in the @xmath43 kev range , resulting in the apparent soft excess and @xmath32 kev spectral break features .",
    "we note that the post - break power - law slopes measured by @xcite are indeed consistent with a very high state spectrum .",
    "finally , work by @xcite has related ulx spectra to the expected spectra from super - critically accreting black holes viewed with the accretion disc close to face - on . in such sources - ss 433",
    "may be an example , viewed edge - on - the break originates from a direct view of the spectrum of the inner - regions of a hot accretion disc .",
    "all these models have a common theme - accretion at around or above the eddington rate .",
    "this strongly suggests black holes of @xmath44 , rather than the @xmath16 imbhs formerly proposed .",
    "snapshot observations , though useful , can only tell us so much about accreting sources . as 10 years of _ rxte",
    "_ observations have shown , for example with galactic black holes , further progress can be made by considering how these observed spectra change with time @xcite .",
    "as ulxs are in general too x - ray faint for monitoring missions like _ rxte _ ( with the exception of m82 x-1 - see @xcite ) , the best one can do is to use monitoring campaigns of snapshot observations separated by days  months .",
    "unfortunately , to date very few campaigns have been pursued . where they have been undertaken ,",
    "sources are observed to behave in two distinct ways .",
    "some ulxs behave as would be expected from classic galactic black hole behaviour , i.e. they get spectrally softer as their flux increases . in contrast , other ulxs behave in the opposite fashion - they get harder @xcite .",
    "we have undertaken such a campaign for the ulx ngc 5204 x-1 using _ chandra _ data , with observations separated by days ",
    "weeks , and find that it behaves in the latter mode @xcite - see fig  [ 5204hrs ] .",
    "in particular , we show that this behaviour can be modelled as changes in the temperature of the optically - thick component of a cool accretion disc plus thick corona model , with the corona heating up as the luminosity of the ulx increases .",
    "this behaviour was also seen in the strongly - comptonised very high state of xte j1550 - 564 @xcite , confirming the viability of the optically - thick corona model for this ulx .",
    "kev ; @xmath45 kev ; @xmath46 kev .",
    "blue data points are from an initial 50-ks observation , with data from ten 5-ks follow - ups shown in red .",
    "the ulx spectrum clearly hardens as its flux increases.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "perhaps the most fundamental timing signal from a ulx is an x - ray periodicity , as it can be used as a first step towards establishing the orbital characteristics of the underlying binary system .",
    "however , such measurements are not very common , with the best detections coming in a couple of cases where eclipses have been found @xcite .",
    "though other claims have been made , they suffer from a lack of data - most are based on @xmath47 cycles , and require confirmation through further observations . in the absence of periodicities , the most useful timing diagnostic is power spectral density ( psd ) measurements for ulxs .",
    "the shape of the fluctuation psd for ulxs is potentially a very powerful tool for ulxs . in particular ,",
    "the characteristic frequency of breaks in the psd slope can be used to infer masses based on a direct scaling of properties between galactic black holes and agn - see @xcite . in fig  [ psdbreaks ]",
    "we demonstrate this concept using a simple linear scaling of black hole mass to break frequency , and show that the 10 - 1000 s timescales over which _",
    "xmm - newton _ observations are most sensitive to measuring breaks matches well with that in which one might find imbhs .     relationship found by @xcite , assuming sources at the eddington limit ( where @xmath48 is the break timescale , @xmath49 is the black hole mass , and @xmath50 is the accretion rate in eddington units ) .",
    "note that sub - eddington accretion rates move the break to the left on this plot ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we shade the region for which _ xmm - newton _ observations are sensitive , showing that this coincides with imbh - like masses .",
    "_ courtesy s. vaughan._,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    unfortunately , ulxs do not generally show much short - term variability @xcite , with very few examples displaying sufficient variability power to establish a psd from @xcite .",
    "however , some measurements have been made .",
    "@xcite detected a putative break at 28 mhz in the psd of ngc 4559 x7 , which they suggest supports the case that it harbours a @xmath16 black hole , although the presence of this spectral break is now disputed @xcite .",
    "another detection of a break frequency was made by @xcite , who found a break at 2.5 mhz in the psd of ngc 5408 x-1 .",
    "when the shape of the psd either side of the break was considered , the authors derived a mass of @xmath20 for this ulx . finally , @xcite find a break at @xmath51 mhz in the psd of m82 x-1 , from which they infer a mass in the @xmath52 range for the underlying black hole .    in 2004",
    "we were awarded a 100-ks _ xmm - newton _ observation in order to derive a psd for the nearby , luminous ulx holmberg ii x-1 @xcite .",
    "however , we found that it displayed no strong variability during the observation .",
    "in fact , through a psd analysis we were able to demonstrate that the fractional variability amounted to less than a few per cent _ rms _ over time scales of minutes to hours .",
    "this variability power is less than that observed in classic high and very high state ( red noise ) psds .",
    "the psd could instead be consistent with the low / hard state , but the energy spectrum for ho ii x-1 is closer to a very high state spectrum ( in fact , it displays a cool disc plus optically - thick corona spectrum ) .",
    "one solution is that the source could be in a state similar to the @xmath53-class of grs1915 + 105 , in which the source is in a very high state , but its psd is band - limited ( i.e. all its variability power is limited to a narrow frequency band ) . as we do not see this band - limited variability , it is likely to be at higher frequencies than we are sensitive to in our psd .",
    "this means the black hole must be small .",
    "in fact , we calculate a limit of @xmath44 for ho ii x-1 from the lack of variability .",
    "a second feature of psds that has diagnostic potential for ulxs are quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "in fact , the detection of 3:2 ratio twin - peak high - frequency qpos at @xmath14 hz would be strong evidence for the presence of an imbh @xcite ( though scaling from galactic systems implies such a measurement is unlikely even in the medium term ) . low frequency qpos , on the other hand , have now been detected in a handful of ulxs @xcite .",
    "however , this type of qpo does not provide a clear , unambiguous mass estimate .",
    "for example , the detection of a qpo in ngc 5408 x-1 , even with the additional diagnostics of a break frequency and a second ( 4:3 ratio ) possible qpo , could imply mass estimates anywhere in the range @xmath54 dependent upon the assumptions made @xcite . despite this",
    ", qpos are telling us one thing - as they are a coherent signal , their detection rules out all but the mildest forms of beaming in ulxs where they are present .",
    "new observational evidence is now pointing away from the interpretation of ulxs as the @xmath16 black holes inferred from simple cool disc plus power - law spectral models . putting to one side the inherent problems with the dominant",
    ", hard power - law component derived from this model , the crucial evidence in this matter is the spectral break above 2 kev detected by @xcite .",
    "this is completely unexpected and inexplicable in the context of the simple @xmath16 black hole interpretation for ulxs .",
    "indeed , it suggests physical characteristics that have more in common with galactic sources accreting at around the eddington limit .",
    "this implies much smaller black hole masses - of the order @xmath37 or less - for ulxs .",
    "are ulxs then stellar - mass black holes that are radiating at super - eddington rates , i.e. factors of @xmath22 above the eddington limit for most ulxs , assuming masses of @xmath55 ?",
    "though this is feasible , it is perhaps not necessary .",
    "almost all ulxs could trivially be explained ( at least in luminosity terms ) by accreting black holes with masses of a few tens of @xmath56 , consistent with their spectra suggesting they are accreting at around ( including slightly above ) the eddington limit .",
    "interestingly , results based on optical observations of ulx counterparts are suggesting a similar conclusion .",
    "for example , a possible radial velocity variation in a he ii line detected from the optical spectrum of ngc 1313 x-2 by @xcite suggests a small black hole mass .",
    "furthermore , irradiation models of donor stars in ulxs , when combined with optical colours , suggest black hole masses of the order @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "a final piece of the puzzle is that the creation of such black holes may be possible in the young stellar populations that we generally find ulxs co - habiting with , from the merging of a binary composed of very massive early - type stars @xcite ( or , alternatively , see footnote 2 ) .",
    "this could yield the black holes with masses of up to @xmath20 that we are potentially finding in ulxs .",
    "hence it now appears that we can tentatively conclude that the vast majority of ulxs could harbour the slightly bigger cousins of the galactic black holes we are familiar with , rather than their far larger distant relatives .",
    "should we call them imbhs ?",
    "the definition of this term is somewhat indistinct , with some authors quoting @xmath57 as the lower limit for this class , and others starting at @xmath20 .",
    "the few times larger than stellar - mass black holes that could be powering ulxs are precisely in this grey area .",
    "perhaps a new artificial distinction between `` small '' ( @xmath44 ) and `` large '' imbhs is required for clarity s sake .",
    "however , the mass of an underlying black hole is yet to be conclusively determined for any individual ulx - this requires the measurement of a dynamical mass function , which is non - trivial for extra - galactic sources .",
    "furthermore , a small and very rare sub - group of the most luminous ulxs - the `` hyperluminous x - ray sources '' with @xmath58 @xcite - defy easy explanation by anything other than large imbhs , assuming they are indeed accreting black holes in the host galaxies , and not luminous supernovae or foreground / background objects .",
    "the issue of whether some ulxs could still constitute evidence for accretion onto large imbhs is therefore far from finished with .",
    "tpr would like to thank his collaborators on the work presented here  most notably ann - marie stobbart and mike goad  and a select yet too - numerous - to - mention group of workers in this and related fields for many very useful conversations .",
    "he would also like to apologise for omitting to mention many other good pieces of work on ulxs due to simple space and subject limitations .",
    "many of the results quoted in this work are based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "finally , thanks to martin ward for presenting this work at the 5th stromlo symposium in tpr s absence .",
