    "recently , as essential relationships relating to agn s activity , the eigenvector 1 space ( boroson & green 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) was found to be related with ages of the stellar populations as assessed by infrared color @xmath7(60,25 ) ( wang et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it is then natural to ask a question `` what is a young agn ? '' .",
    "mathur ( 2000 ) argued that narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) with high eddington ratio and small black hole mass might be a young agn .",
    "if so , the co - evolution of agn and starburst implies that nls1s are expected to be associated with relatively young stellar populations .    to understand the elusive agn - starburst connection",

    "the total light spectrum at rest frame is displayed in figure 1 ( the second line from top to bottom ) .",
    "the spectrum clearly shows a prominent balmer jump at blue even diluted by an agn continuum and high order balmer series .    in the next step",
    ", the principal component analysis ( pca ) method is developed to remove the stellar light from the observed spectrum ( e.g. , li et al . 2005 ; hao et al 2005 ) .",

    "the first seven eigenspectra are used to model the starlight component by their linear combination . in order to appropriate model the starlight component ,",

    "we find ew(hei+naid)@xmath21  and ( hei+naid)/h@xmath22 .",
    "the naid emission was detected in a few agns ( e.g. , veron - cetty et al .",
    "2004 ; veron - cetty et al . 2006 and references therein , thompson 1991 ) .",
    "the calculations indicated that the existence of large naid emission ( naid / h@xmath7=0.01 - 0.05 ) is related to models with high density ( @xmath23 ) and large column density ( @xmath24 ) ( thompson 1991 ) .",
    "the measured line properties are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the propagation of error is included in the uncertainties shown in parentheses .",

    "according to its spectra properties , we classify sdssj085338.27 + 033246.1 as a nls1 both because of the extremely faint [ oiii ] emission ( [ oiii]/h@xmath250.05 ) and because of the relatively narrow h@xmath18 broad component ( fwhm(h@xmath26)=@xmath27 ) .",
    "moreover , the measured rfe is as large as @xmath28 , which is typical of nls1s .",
    "we further calculate its black hole virial mass and eddington ratio in terms of the h@xmath7 broad component according to the equations in greene & ho ( 2005 ) : @xmath29 @xmath30 the intrinsic luminosity @xmath31 is used for calculations because of the large intrinsic extinction @xmath32 .",
    "the extinction is calculated from the line ratio h@xmath33/h@xmath34 , assuming a galactic extinction curve and @xmath13 ( osterbrock 1989 ) . the inferred virial mass and eddington ratio is @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that all these properties ( i.e. , small black hole mass , large rfe value and large eddington ratio ) indicate the object should be potentially classified as a nls1 .    the radio radiation at 1.4ghz of the object was detected by nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and first survey ( becker et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the map of the first survey shows an unresolved source with a flux @xmath34.04mjy and position @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the discrepancy in position given by the optical and radio surveys is much less than 1 ( @xmath30.3 ) .",
    "we determined the extinction - corrected continuum flux that is contributed by agn at rest wavelength @xmath37 to be @xmath38mjy . if the radio emission is mainly due to agn , the inferred radio loudness @xmath39 defined as @xmath40 ( kellermann et al .",

    "is an object with intermediately strong radio emission .",
    "we further calculate its radio luminosity @xmath45 .",
    "this luminosity has same order of magnitude of the most radio - luminous starburst ( @xmath46 , smith et al .",

    "the lifetime of these massive supernova progenitors is @xmath48yr .",
    "the radio supernova itself and its remnant has lifetime @xmath49yr and @xmath50yr , respectively .",
    "the average sfr over the past @xmath51yr therefore relates with the radio emission attributed to supernova as ( condon 1992 ) @xmath52 for the object , the estimated average sfr is @xmath53 ( see sect . 3.2 for details ) . using a salpeter imf ( salpeter 1955 )",
    ", this corresponds to a @xmath54 .",
    "the inferred luminosity is therefore @xmath55 and is about one order lower than the total radio luminosity .",
    "the `` a - type star '' spectrum indicates the age of the stellar population is no more than a few@xmath56 yrs . to interpret the spectrum of the young stellar population , we extract a series of spectra of ssp models of bc03 with a solar metallicity and with a chabrier initial mass function .",
    "the extracted spectra are matched with the observed spectrum one by one within the wavelength range 3500 - 5000 .",
    "the spectrum red of @xmath165000 is not used because this part is obviously contaminated by an old population .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the best match between the observed spectrum and a 0.1gyr old ssp model .",
    "the model predicted mass of the starburst is @xmath57 .",
    "this simple ssp model shows a past average sfr @xmath58 .",
    "however , recent studies suggested that the agn and starburst activity perhaps not co - evolve simultaneously .",
    "schmitt ( 2001 ) suggested that the starbursts may predominate over agns in their earlier phase .",
    "yan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) recently suggested that most of sdss post - starburst galaxies hold somewhat agn like activities .",
    "the post - starburst is the phase in which the galaxy already ceased star formation at some recent epoch .",
    "the derived @xmath59gyr post - starburst in sdssj085338.27 + 033246.1 is somewhat similar with the @xmath60gyr post - starburst that was obtained by brotherton et al .",

    "the sfr is inferred to be round about 3.0 @xmath71 by adopting the assumption used in ho ( 2005 ) , i.e. , the metallicity is twice of solar corresponding to @xmath72 . here , we obtain a residual but quenched ongoing sfr as obtained in the optically selected qsos by ho ( 2005 ) .",
    "the distance - independent birthrate parameter @xmath73 is defined as the ratio of the current sfr to the average past one ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1994 ) . as a particular case ,",
    "the object has extremely small value of @xmath74 , i.e. , has present sfr significantly lower than the past .",
    "the traditional bpt diagram ( baldwin et al . 1981 ) is a powerful tool for diagnosing the origin of emission of narrow lines for emission - line galaxies .",
    "the location of the object in the bpt diagram in which the line ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath18 is plotted against [ nii]/h@xmath7 is marked by solid square in figure 3 ( left panel ) .",

    "the similar plot is shown in figure 3 ( right panel ) but for [ oiii]/h@xmath18 v.s . ( [ sii]@xmath166719 + 6731)/h@xmath7 . in this case , the position of the object falls into the region that represents starburst and is far below the demarcation line .",
    "the combination of these two diagnosis suggests the observed narrow emission lines are mainly produced by star - formation .",
    "what is the distribution in the bpt diagram for post - starburst agns is a further interesting question .      here",
    "it is interesting to give more discussions on the elusive agn - starburst connection .",
    "wang et al . ( 2006 ) recently indicated that the well - documented e1 sequence most likely represents an evolutionary track of agn .",
    "the track further implies that agn with high eddington ratio evolves to one with low eddington ratio .",
    "this result also naturally implies that nls1s that occupy one extreme end of e1 should be associated with relatively young stellar populations .",
    "apart from the evidence mentioned above , for the ir - selected qsos , canalizo & stockton ( 2001 ) found the ages of circumnuclear stellar populations range from current star formation to @xmath75myr old .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy studies indicated that about 70%-100% ir - selected qsos are extremely or intermediately strong feii emitters ( e.g. , lipari et al .",
    "2003 ; zheng et al .",
    "moreover , zhou et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that more than half of the post - starburst type i agn fulfill the criterion for nls1 .",
    "all these evidence appear to reveal that a young agn is most likely a strong feii emitter with relatively narrow h@xmath18 profile .",
    "in contrast , old stellar populations ( @xmath76gyr ) are found to dominate the off - nuclear ( @xmath77 ) stellar population for optical - selected qsos ( nolan et al .",
    "2001 and references there in ) .",
    "these accumulating clues lead us to propose a possible evolutionary scenario that links both agn and starburst phenomena",
    ". the massive starburst might be dominant in the earlier evolutionary phase .",
    "then the starburst passively evolves to a - type stars when the plenty gas falls into the center of a galaxy under the gravitational attraction of smbh . at one stage about @xmath78yr after the beginning of the starburst , the smbh begin to accrete matter with small black hole mass and high eddington ratio .",
    "the feedback of the agn suppresses circumnuclear star formation at the same time ( e.g. , kim et al .",
    "the black hole mass grow substantially in the formed bulge in this short phase ( e.g. mathur et al .",
    "2001 ; mathur & grupe 2005 ) .",
    "the duration of the phase is commonly estimated as @xmath79-folding time scale @xmath80yr ( salpeter 1964 ) , where @xmath81 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "the differential growth of agn and starburst allows the nls1s below the @xmath82 relation for inactive galaxies to approach normal @xmath82 relation ( mathur & grupe 2005 ; mathur et al .",
    "2001 ; wandel 2002 ; bian & zhao 2004 ) .",
    "the agn then shines with decreasing accretion rate and insignificantly increasing black hole mass because of the consumption of the gas .",
    "the scenario implies that the agn and host co - evolve marginally around the common @xmath82 relation .",
    "the luminous agn phase persists for typical agn lifetime which is usually believed to be @xmath83 yr with however large uncertainties ( see reviews in matini 2004 ) . during this phase , the young stellar population continuously ages and",
    "its importance gradually fades .",
    "the underlying old stellar population ( a few gyr ) finally becomes dominant in the emission of host of an old agn .",
    "in fact , in addition to the old stellar populations , relatively old post - starbursts ( 0.1 - 2gyr ) are frequently detected in off - nuclear regions of a few powerful radio - loud agns ( e.g. tadhunter et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "after the luminous phase , agn then passively evolves to a stage with low luminosity , or low radiative efficiency .    in summary",
    ", this scenario could be described as following path : starburst @xmath84 nls1+post - starburst @xmath84 luminous agn with decreased eddington ratio+old stellar population @xmath84 less luminous agn .",
    "we believe future studies of agn+post - starburst composite objects such as sdssj085338.27 + 033246.1 are important for developing a rational scenario to interpret the agn - starburst connection .",
    "the physical properties of post - starburst agn sdssj085338.27 + 033246.1 are derived by analyzing its optical spectrum .",
    "it allows us to obtain results as following .",
    "the object can be identified as a nls1 ( ( [ oiii]/h@xmath85 , @xmath86 and rfe=2.4@xmath80.2 ) associated with a post - starburst stellar population as identified from the size of the balmer jump .",
    "a simple ssp model indicates the starburst with a mass @xmath87 possibly took place @xmath88 yr ago .",
    "the [ oii ] inferred sfr is as small as @xmath33.0@xmath89 which is much smaller than the past average one @xmath6 .",

    "<S> the spectra pca method is developed to extract emission lines and absorption features from the total light spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the emission - line analysis indicates that the object can be classified as a nls1 with feii / h@xmath0 , large eddington ratio ( @xmath1 ) , small black hole mass ( @xmath2 ) and intermediately strong radio emission . </S>",
    "<S> a simple ssp model indicates that the absorption features are reproduced by a @xmath3100 myr old starburst with a mass of @xmath4 rather well . </S>",
    "<S> the current sfr @xmath5 inferred from the [ oii ] emission is much smaller than the past average sfr@xmath6 , however . </S>",
    "<S> the line ratio diagnosis using the bpt diagrams indicates that the narrow emission lines are almost entirely emitted from hii regions . </S>",
