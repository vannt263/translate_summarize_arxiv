    "many attempts @xcite have been made to account for the unexpected behavior of the recent expansion of the universe . in a previous paper @xcite , we showed that non - perturbative quantum effects in the vacuum may account for the sne - ia data @xcite suggesting a recent acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",

    "we found an approximate solution to the effective einstein gravitational field equations . in that solution",
    ", there was a sudden transition ( at redshift @xmath12 of order @xmath13 ) from an earlier matter dominated stage of the expansion to a mildly inflating de sitter expansion .",
    "this sudden transition model required the universe to be spatially open in order to fit the cosmological data .    here",

    "it appears that the existing data favors a spatially - flat cosmological model .",

    "this effective action is the simplest one that gives the standard trace anomaly in the massless - conformally - coupled limit , and contains the explicit sum ( in arbitrary dimensions ) of all terms in the propagator having at least one factor of the scalar curvature , @xmath11 .",

    "( [ one ] ) is proportional to the trace of the quantum contribution to the stress tensor . in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) , we have assumed that terms in the quantum stress tensor that depend on derivatives of the curvature are negligible .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the solution that we obtain .    in @xcite",
    ", we found that eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) admits a solution in which a matter - dominated frw universe transits to a stage of the expansion in which the scalar curvature is nearly constant .",
    "this led us to construct an approximate cosmological model which makes a _ sudden _ transition to a de sitter universe out of a matter - dominated one . in that approximation , we needed a spatially - open cosmology in order to fit high - redshift sne - ia data , and to get a reasonable value of the present matter density .    in this paper",
    ", we eliminate the assumption of a sudden transition to a de sitter expansion , by finding an analytic solution to the effective einstein equations of our model .",
    "consistency with cosmological observations requires that this improved analytic solution has zero ( or nearly zero ) spatial curvature .",
    "this solution consists of a matter - dominated universe smoothly , with continous first and second derivatives of the scale factor ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) , joined to a constant scalar curvature expansion that asymptotes to a de sitter universe at late times .",
    "the spatial flatness is consistent with estimates of the first acoustic peak of small angular scale fluctuations in the cmbr , which suggest that the universe is spatially flat ( although this issue awaits an ultimate decision at the time of writing , see ref .",

    "we now turn to the derivation of a smooth solution for the cosmological scale factor , @xmath28 .",
    "in the following analysis , as in @xcite , we take @xmath31 . for @xmath32 , and with a low value of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ev ) ,",
    "we find in @xcite that the evolution of the frw universe is essentially unaffected by the quantum contributions at early times .",
    "a perturbative analysis in @xmath35 shows that quantum contributions to the stress tensor begin to have a significant effect at a time @xmath36 , when the classical scalar curvature has decreased to a value given roughly by [ two ] r_cl(t_j ) = ^2 , where ^2 m^2/(- ) .",
    "this effect is shown to occur well into the matter - dominated stage of the evolution ( therefore , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) .",
    "we further argue that , after the scalar curvature reaches the value @xmath39 ( i.e. for @xmath40 ) , it stays essentially constant during the later evolution of the universe .",
    "more precisely , for all times @xmath37 , we find that the scalar curvature has the form [ r ] r(t ) = ^2(1-(t ) ) , where [ ep ] ( t ) = ( -+ ( ^2 + 4 ^ -1)^1/2 ) , and [ del ] = - - ^-1 ,  = ( v(t)- )",
    ". here , r = , @xmath41 being the planck mass . as shown in @xcite , it is straightforward to verify that @xmath42 is of order @xmath43 for @xmath37 and of order @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "for the low value of @xmath43 under consideration , it follows that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "thus the scalar curvature stays nearly constant at the value @xmath48 for @xmath47 .    despite the constancy of the scalar curvature , the quantum contribution to the stress tensor increases dramatically from the time @xmath36 to the present time @xmath6 . to see this , consider the trace of the quantum stress - tensor , @xmath49 , defined by @xmath50rhs of ( [ one])@xmath51 .",
    "it follows from ( [ one ] ) that ( with @xmath52 ) , [ quantt ] t_q & = & -2_o r - t_cl + & = & -2_o ^2 + _ m + o ( ) , where the second approximate equality holds for @xmath47 . assuming ( as we find ) that the transition time @xmath36 occurs at a redshift @xmath53 of order @xmath13 , and given that @xmath54 ( from eq .",

    "( [ quantt ] ) , @xmath49 grows from @xmath56 at time @xmath36 to @xmath57 at the present time @xmath6 .",
    "thus , we find that the quantum contribution to the stress tensor grows from a negligible value at a redshift of order @xmath13 to a value exceeding the classical contribution at the present time .    to obtain the scale factor @xmath28 , we consider a spatially flat ( @xmath58 ) cosmology , and find the constant scalar curvature solution for @xmath47 that joins to the usual matter - dominated solution at time @xmath36 , with continous first and second derivatives .",
    "the time @xmath36 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) , using @xmath59 for @xmath60 in the spatially flat matter - dominated universe , is t_j = ( 2/)^-1 .",

    "for @xmath37 , we now obtain the unique solution to the constant scalar curvature equation [ coneq ] r = 6 ( + ) = ^2 , that satisfies h(t_j ) = ( t_j)/a(t_j ) = /.",
    "continuity of the scalar curvature at @xmath36 ensures that the second derivative of the scale factor is also continuous .",
    "this solution is [ met1 ] a(t ) = a(t_j ) ,  t > t_j , where [ c ] = - ^-1(12 ) 0.117 .",
    "we have verified that this solution also satisfies the remaining einstein equations up to terms of order @xmath62 . according to eq .",

    "also , the solution joins in a smooth ( @xmath30 ) manner to the usual spatially flat matter - dominated solution for @xmath66 , i.e. [ met2 ] a(t ) = a(t_j)(t / t_j)^2/3 = ( t/2)^2/3 ,  t < t_j .",
    "this solution , given by eqs .",
    "( [ met1 ] ) , ( [ c ] ) and ( [ met2 ] ) , depends on only one parameter , @xmath14 .",
    "it is more accurate than the approximation of a sudden transition to a de sitter expansion , that we used in @xcite .",
    "our analytic solution takes a long time ( of order @xmath67 ) to approach a de sitter expansion .",
    "this is the reason that the spatially flat model gives agreement with observations ( as we show below ) .",
    "in the approximation of a sudden transition to de sitter , consistency with observations required a negative spatial curvature .",
    "we further note that our analytic solution is not the same as that of a mixed matter - cosmological constant model , for which @xmath68 .",

    "it should be noted that the allowed range of values of @xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ mrange ] ) does not by itself constrain @xmath53 and @xmath3 . the lowest allowed value of @xmath0",
    "gives @xmath136 and @xmath123 , and the highest allowed value gives @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "here , we argue that , in our model , values within an oder of magnitude of @xmath13 for @xmath53 and @xmath135 are more likely than other values .",
    "the argument that follows rests on two assumptions : ( i ) @xmath139 , and ( ii ) all values of @xmath0 within the allowed range given by eq .",
    "( [ mrange ] ) have equal _ a priori _ probability .",
    "assumption ( i ) implies the range of @xmath0 values of eq .",
    "( [ mrange ] ) , and assumption ( ii ) is reasonable in lieu of a detailed fundamental theory that predicts the value of @xmath0 .",
    "given these two assumptions , one may compute the probability distributions for @xmath53 and @xmath3 in a straightforward manner , since both quantities are functions of @xmath0 alone . by assumption ( ii ) , the probability distribution function for @xmath0 , @xmath140 , has the form p(m_h ) & = & p_0 ,  3.69 10 ^ -33 ev < m_h < 7.39 10 ^ -33 ev , + & = & 0 ,  otherwise .",
    "normalization of @xmath140 yields @xmath141 ev .",
    "we then obtain the probability distribution functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 for @xmath53 and @xmath135 respectively , as p(z_j ) & = & p_0/ , + p(_0/(1-_0 ) ) & = & p_0/ , where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ zj ] ) and ( [ omo ] ) respectively .",
    "we now compute the probability that @xmath53 and @xmath135 lie between @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( i.e. , they are within an order of magnitude of @xmath13 ) .",
    "we find p[0.1<z_j<10 ] & = & _ 0.1 ^ 10dz_j p(z_j ) = 0.851 , + p[0.1<_0/(1-_0)<10 ] & = & _ 0.1 ^ 10d ( ) p ( ) = 0.619 .",
    "it is therefore more likely for @xmath53 and @xmath135 to be within an order of magnitude of @xmath13 rather than outside that range , assuming that all allowed values of @xmath0 have equal _ a priori _ probability .",
    "we have shown that vacuum effects of a free scalar field of very low mass can account for the observed acceleration ( i.e. , the sne - ia data ) , while at the same time predicting reasonable values for the age of the universe and the total matter density .",
    "evidently , our model also predicts reasonable light element abundances , and as a consequence of spatial flatness is in agreement with current data on small angular scale cmbr fluctuations .",
    "better sne - ia data would be able to distinguish between our model and mixed matter - cosmological constant models , as well as quintessence models @xcite .",
    "the curves of @xmath95 vs @xmath12 are different in our model from those of the other models .",
    "future observations of small angular size cmbr fluctuations may also distinguish between these models .",
    "we emphasize that our model is based on a free renormalizable quantum field and does not require that we live at a very special time in the evolution of the universe .",
    "we also note that a graviton field of very low mass may give rise to vacuum effects similar to those of the scalar field we considered here .",
    "in contrast , a scalar particle of very high mass with similar characteristics to the present one , may contribute to a stage of early inflation , with reheating and exit from inflation caused by particle production from the vacuum and possibly from other inflationary exit mechanisms .",
