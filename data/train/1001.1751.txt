    "the discovery of superconductivity in reofepn ( re = rare earth ; pn = p or as , 1111-system ) @xcite@xmath10@xcite with high transition temperature @xmath11 has generated a great deal of interests .",
    "shortly after , several other groups of iron - based superconductors have been discovered , such as afe@xmath12as@xmath12 ( a = alkaline or alkaline - earth metals , 122-system),@xcite@xmath13@xcite lifeas ( 111-system),@xcite ( sr@xmath14m@xmath12o@xmath15)(fe@xmath12pn@xmath12 ) ( m = sc , ti or v , 42622-system),@xcite@xmath13@xcite and @xmath16-pbo type fese ( 11-system).@xcite in particular , the discovery of superconductivity in fese , fete@xmath17se@xmath18,@xcite and fete@xmath17s@xmath18@xcite opened new directions .",
    "simple binary fe based superconductors can help to understand the mechanism of superconductivity because they share the most prominent characteristics with other iron - based superconductors , i.e. , a square - planar lattice of fe with tetrahedral coordination and similar fermi surface topology.@xcite furthermore , 11-type superconductors exhibit some distinctive features : absence of charge reservoir , significant pressure effect,@xcite and excess fe with local moment.@xcite    in order to understand the mechanism of superconductivity of iron - based superconductors , it is important to study the upper critical field @xmath19",
    ". this is one of the most important superconducting parameters since it provides valuable information on fundamental superconducting properties : coherence length , anisotropy , details of underlying electronic structures and dimensionality of superconductivity as well as insights into the pair - breaking mechanism .",
    "there are two remarkable common characteristics in @xmath20-@xmath21 phase diagram in iron - based superconductors . for 1111-system , @xmath22 shows pronounced upturn curvature at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast , @xmath23 exhibits a downturn curvature with decreasing temperature.@xcite the former can be explained by two band theory with high diffusivity ratio of electron band to hole band and the latter is mainly ascribed to the spin - paramagnetic effect.@xcite@xmath10@xcite for 122-system ( ( ba , k)fe@xmath12as@xmath12 and sr(fe , co)@xmath12as@xmath12 ) , the upturn curvature of @xmath24 present in 1111-system does not appear , but it still shows positive curvature of temperature far below t@xmath25 without saturation .",
    "@xcite@xmath10altarawneh it can also be interpreted using two band theory with smaller diffusivity ratio of two bands when compared to 1111-system.@xcite on the other hand @xmath23 tends to saturate with decreasing temperature and it also originates from spin - paramagnetic effect.@xcite however , for kfe@xmath12as@xmath12 , both @xmath23 and @xmath22 show saturation trend at low temperature with different negative curvature .",
    "the former can be ascribed to the spin - paramagnetic effect and the latter is mainly determined by orbital limited field in one band scenario.@xcite    previous research on polycrystalline fese@xmath26te@xmath27 using pulsed magnetic fields up to 55 t , indicated that spin - paramagnetic effect dominates @xmath0.@xcite however , it is necessary to elucidate whether this kind of effect dominates the @xmath23 or ( and ) @xmath24 . in this work ,",
    "we report the upper critical field anisotropy of fe@xmath1te@xmath2se@xmath3 and fe@xmath4te@xmath5se@xmath6 single crystals in stable dc high magnetic field up to 35 t .",
    "we show that spin - paramagnetic effect is dominant in both of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "single crystals of fe(te , se ) were grown by self - flux method with nominal composition fete@xmath28se@xmath28 and fete@xmath29se@xmath30 .",
    "stoichiometric elemental fe ( purity 99.98% , alfa aesar ) , te ( purity 99.999% , alfa aesar ) , and se ( purity 99.999% , alfa aesar ) were sealed in quartz tubes under partial argon atmosphere .",
    "the sealed ampoule was heated to a soaking temperature of 950 @xmath31c , then slowly cooled to 300 - 400 @xmath31c .",
    "plate - like crystals up to 2@xmath325@xmath321 mm@xmath33 can be grown . the powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) spectra",

    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) results of the ground samples indicate the phases for both of them are pure . the lattice parameters , a = b=3.798(2 ) , c=6.063(2 )  and a = b=3.818(2 ) , c=6.243(2 )  for nominal composition fete@xmath28se@xmath28 and fete@xmath29se@xmath30 , respectively , are obtained by fitting the xrd spectra using the rietica software.@xcite on the other hand , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) spectra of single crystals reveal that the crystal surface is normal to the c - axis with the plate - shaped surface parallel to the ab - plane .",
    "the elemental and microstructure analysis were performed using energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy in an jeol jsm-6500 scanning electron microscope .",

    "it should be noted that , as seen from the insets , se-39 exhibits a metallic resistivity behavior in normal state , whereas se-11 is not metallic .",
    "this difference can be ascribed to different se content.yeh kw@xmath13@xcite the non - metallic behavior of se-11 has also been observed in low s doped fete single crystals.@xcite in addition , more excess fe in fe(2 ) site for se-11 than se-39 could lead to weak charge carrier localization.@xcite@xmath13@xcite on the other hand , there is an anomalous peak in @xmath38 for se-11 at t@xmath4542k .",
    "it corresponds to simultaneous structural and ( or ) antiferromagnetic transitions . comparing with undoped fete,@xcite",
    "the transtion has been depressed from around 65k to 42k .     of ( a ) se-39 and ( b ) se-11 corresponding three defined temperatures at low fields .",
    "the dotted and solid lines are linear fitting to the data for h@xmath39c and h@xmath39ab , respectively . ]",
    "2 shows the upper critical field @xmath0 of se-39 and se-11 corresponding to the temperatures where the resistivity drops to 90% of the normal state resistivity @xmath46 , 50% of @xmath47 and 10% of @xmath48 in low fields .",
    "the normal - state resistivity @xmath49 was determined by linearly extrapolating the normal - state behavior above the onset of superconductivity transition in @xmath38 curves ( same as for @xmath50 curves ) .",
    "because the curves of @xmath0 for all defined temperatures are almost linear except for @xmath51 of se-39 with slightly upturn curvature near 0 t , we use the linear fitting results at low field near @xmath11 as the slopes of @xmath52 .",
    "this is shown by solid and dotted lines in fig . 2 and",

    "can be described by @xmath54and the values corresponding to three defined temperatures are also listed in table 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tablekey copy(1 ) ]    it is instructive to discuss the origin of enhancement of spin - paramagnetic effect , i.e. , reduced values of @xmath55 .",
    "the maki parameter @xmath16 is enhanced for disordered systems.@xcite@xmath13@xcite for se-39 , more se doping introduces more disorder than in se-11 .",
    "this effect could contribute to larger @xmath56 of se-39 when compared to se-11 .",
    "however , it can not explain the inverse trend of @xmath57 .",
    "therefore another effect must compete with disorder .",
    "this may be the effect of excess fe in fe(2 ) position .",
    "excess fe in fe(2 ) position is the unique feature of 11-system , different from other fe pnictide superconductors .",
    "the fe(2 ) has larger local magnetic moment than fe(1 ) in fe-(te , se ) layers .",
    "the fe(2 ) moment is present even if the sdw antiferromagnetic ordering of the fe plane is suppressed by doping or pressure , contributing to @xmath58.@xcite according to the expression of @xmath55 with strong coupling correction considering e - boson and e - e interaction:@xcite@xmath13@xcite@xmath13schossmann    @xmath59    where @xmath60 describes the strong coupling intraband correction for the gap , @xmath61 is the stoner factor @xmath61=@xmath62 , @xmath58 is the electronic density of states ( dos ) per spin at the fermi level @xmath63 , @xmath64 is an effective exchange integral , @xmath65 is introduced to describe phenomenologically the effect of the gap anisotropy , @xmath35 is electron  boson coupling constant and @xmath66=0.5 or 1 . it can be seen that @xmath55 can decrease if the stoner factor increases via enhancement of @xmath64 or @xmath58 .",
    "excess fe in fe(2 ) site with local magnetic moment could interact with itinerant electron in fe layer , resulting in exchange enhanced pauli paramagnetism or ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction , thus enhancing @xmath64 .",
    "hence , higher content of excess fe in se-11 , could lead to larger @xmath67 than in se-39 .",
    "another possibility may be that the @xmath58 is decreased with increasing the content of se.@xcite this trend will also enhance the pauli limited field , i.e. suppress the spin - paramagnetic effect , according to above formula .",
    "this could be why the @xmath55 of se-39 is higher than that of se-11 if we assume other parameters in eq .",
    "( 6 ) are not changed .",
    "finally , we discuss the anisotropy of @xmath0 .",
    "the temperature dependence of anisotropy of @xmath0 , @xmath68=@xmath69 , obtained from the @xmath70 data is shown in fig .",
    "6(c ) as a function of reduced temperature @xmath71=@xmath72 . the @xmath73 of se-11 is smaller than that of se-39 .",
    "the difference in @xmath73 between the two samples decreases gradually .",
    "both @xmath73 values decrease to about 1 with decreasing temperature , larger than in fe(te , s ) and similar to previously reported in fe(te , se).@xcite@xmath13@xcite these results show that fe(te , se ) is a high - field isotropic superconductor .",
    "in summary , the anisotropy in the upper critical field of fe@xmath1te@xmath2se@xmath3 and fe@xmath4te@xmath5se@xmath6 single crystals was studied in high and stable magnetic fields up to 35 t.it is found that the zero - temperature upper critical field is much smaller than the predicted result of whh theory without the spin - paramagnetic effect .",
    "the anisotropy of the upper critical field decreases with decreasing temperature , becoming nearly isotropic at low temperature .",
    "the spin - paramagnetic effect is the dominant pair - breaking mechanism for both of h@xmath39ab and h@xmath39c .",
