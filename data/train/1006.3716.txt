    "it is believed that the geometric properties of this kind of curves can be described by a family of self - avoiding stochastic processes introduced by schramm .",
    "the self - avoidance property is obtained by iteratively removing , during the growth of the curve , the hull formed from the curve itself and all non - reachable domains enclosed by the curve .",
    "this removal is performed by a conformal transformation . as a consequence ,",
    "the construction relies on both the assumption of conformal invariance and on markovian property .",
    "the family of curves obtained in this way is parameterized by a single parameter @xmath1 corresponding to the intensity of the noise in the underlying brownian process .",

    "predictions of @xmath4 have been tested more specifically for this model by gamsa and cardy  @xcite .",

    "as expected since @xmath33 , gamsa and cardy measured the parameter @xmath32 for the spin interfaces and @xmath34 for the interfaces between the fortuin - kastelyn clusters , in agreement with the values expected for @xmath33 model . unlike in the ising model , certain ambiguities arise for the interfaces in the potts model . when fixing two different potts states on the boundaries at the left and at the right of the system ,",
    "two interfaces are usually induced since a cluster of the third state may appear between the left and right clusters .",
    "gamsa and cardy generalized the schramm formula for the left - passage probability to the case of two sle curves  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the 3-state potts model , the two curves sometimes collapse in a finite system and the latter formula for the left - passage probability does not hold . to circumvent this problem , gamsa and cardy",
    "have also studied fluctuating boundary conditions : the left boundary is fixed to one of the potts states while at the right boundary , spins are free to take any of the two other potts states . with these boundary conditions ,",
    "only one interface is induced and the original schramm formula for the left - passage probability can be applied .",

    "our aim is to check whether such a discrepancy exists for the random - bond potts model too .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a square geometry with fluctuating boundary conditions and to interfaces between spin clusters . in the first section , we present the numerical details of the monte carlo simulations that we have performed .",

    "each monte carlo step consists into one iteration of the metropolis algorithm and one of the swendsen - wang algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the dynamics of an interface with the swendsen - wang algorithm is very slow and may even be slower than with local monte carlo algorithms ( see for example table  1 of @xcite ) . the combination of the two algorithms may help the system to escape dynamical traps . for equilibration of the system , between @xmath47 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) monte carlo steps were discarded ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "measurements were taken every five monte carlo steps .",

    "the number of measurements may appear at first sight unnecessarily large since it may be argued that the average over randomness will smooth thermal fluctuations .",
    "smaller numbers of measurements have indeed led to accurate values of the critical exponents in the past . however , in our problem , preliminary tests have shown that a smaller number of monte carlo steps leads to systematic deviations on the estimate of @xmath1 due to the large autocorrelation time of the interface .",
    "+ the measurements were then averaged over @xmath52 different random configurations of the exchange couplings @xmath53 with the optimal ratio @xmath54 determined by jacobsen _",
    "et al . _",
    "since the random realizations are uncorrelated , the measurements obtained for each of them are statistically independent random variables so that the error can be estimated , according to the central - limit theorem , as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mean square deviation of the observable among the random configurations .",
    "additional simulations have been performed for other values @xmath57 of the amplitude of randomness .",

    "the interface goes straight as long as the spin at the right is in the same state as the left boundary and the one at the left in one of the two other states .",
    "ambiguous situations may arise : when the interface can not go straight , the spin at the right of the interface can be in some cases in the same state as the left boundary whether the interface turns on the right or on the left .",
    "the algorithm is thus not able to choose one of the two possible directions  . on figure [ fig0 ] , four of these situations",
    "are depicted .",
    "we arbitrarily imposed the rule that the interface should always turn on the right in these cases ( _ turn - right tie - breaking _ rule ) .",
    "as a consequence , the algorithm may fail to detect the correct interface .",
    "because of the rule of always turning on the right in case of ambiguity , the interface may touch itself and thus form loops enclosing a cluster in a different state . as shown on figure [ fig0 ] , this can only happen on the left of the interface .",
    "direct visualization of spin configurations shows that the number of these loops is of order @xmath59 and that the cluster sizes are most of the time limited to a few spins and are always much smaller than the lattice size . + in order to gauge the influence of these unwanted loops on the scaling dimension of the interface and on the left - passage probability , we estimated @xmath1 for the pure 3-state model and compared with the expected value @xmath60 .",
    "as will be seen in the following , the scaling dimension is not affected by the presence of these loops .",
    "we note that the absence of noticeable effect on the scaling dimension has also been reported recently in the case of the pure ising model  @xcite .",
    "it is not the case however for the left - passage probability .",
    "a small but systematic deviation from the schramm formula is observed on the left part of the lattice .",
    "this deviation affects the estimation of @xmath1 . following the procedure presented in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 for @xmath49 .",
    "since the loops appears only on the left of the interface , it creates a left - right asymmetry .",
    "fortunately , the restriction of the interpolation of the data with the schramm formula to the right third of the lattice , i.e. for @xmath62\\times [ 0;l-1]$ ] only turns out to give @xmath63 for @xmath49 in much better agreement with the expected value @xmath60 for the pure model .",
    "the scaling of the interface length was already determined by jacobsen _",
    "et al._. besides reproducing their result , we present here a study of the influence of disorder .",
    "as already mentioned , we will restrict ourselves to the interfaces between spin clusters .",
    "for the pure model , we obtain @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath65 , in very good agreement with the expected value @xmath60 .",
    "our data for the disorder amplitude @xmath66 , i.e. at the random fixed point , is plotted on figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "a simple power - law fit @xmath8 leads to the fractal dimension @xmath67 and thus to the value @xmath68 .",
    "however , a deviation from a pure power - law can be observed , for example , by removing the smallest lattices sizes . in the inset of figure [ fig3 ] ,",
    "the fractal dimension obtained when taking into account in the fit only the data with lattice sizes larger than @xmath58 is plotted with respect to @xmath69 .",
    "while the effective fractal dimension for the pure system is relatively stable , a tendency to lower values of @xmath0 is clearly observed in the random case .",
    "the last points are very noisy because the interpolation is made only with the two or three largest lattice sizes .",
    "the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit is then delicate .",
    "should the two last points be interpreted as a real trend or a statistical fluctuation  ?",
    "our final estimate will be @xmath70 which correspond to @xmath2 .",
    "this value is less accurate but compatible within error bars with the estimate given by jacobsen _",
    "( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath0 and thus @xmath1 are sensitive to the estimate @xmath40 of the disorder amplitude at the random fixed point . as shown on figure [ fig2 ] , @xmath0 and thus @xmath1 diminishes when the disorder gets stronger .",
    "a linear interpolation of @xmath0 versus @xmath57 allows for a rough estimation of the additional error @xmath72 due to the uncertainty @xmath73 on @xmath40 . with the value @xmath74 given by jacobsen",
    ", we obtained @xmath75 and thus @xmath76 , an order of magnitude smaller than the statistical error .    besides the necessity to average over random realizations , numerical simulations of random systems present the difficulty that an observable @xmath77 may not be self - averaging .",
    "in such a situation , the average of @xmath77 over @xmath78 disorder realizations goes to @xmath79 in the limit @xmath80 but the relative fluctuations @xmath81/\\langle\\phi^2\\rangle$ ] do not vanish .",
    "the probability distribution of the length @xmath7 of the interface is shown on figure  [ fig1 ] for different lattice sizes @xmath58 . when plotted with respect to @xmath82",
    ", the probability distribution appears the same for all lattice sizes .",
    "it means that the mean square deviation @xmath83 scales as @xmath84 .",
    "the cumulant @xmath85 is thus constant : the interface length is non self - averaging .",
    "another important feature of random systems is that the typical event may differ from the average .",
    "as seen on figure [ fig1 ] , the probability distribution of the interface length is not symmetric and thus these events indeed differ slightly .",
    "however , the distribution does not present any long tail with rare events difficult to observe in numerical simulations .",
    "we rather observe a distribution close to a gaussian .",
    "finally , random systems have the peculiar property to possibly display multifractality : different moments of an observable @xmath77 may present a different scaling behavior , i.e. @xmath86 where @xmath87 depends of the order @xmath88 of the moment .",
    "the first moments @xmath89 have been computed .",
    "all fractal dimensions @xmath90 corresponding to the scaling behavior @xmath91 are compatible within error bars .",
    "we conclude that the interface length is not multifractal .",
    "we now determine @xmath1 from the schramm formula of the left - passage probability .",
    "we follow the same procedure as @xcite .",
    "the left - passage probability @xmath92 was estimated numerically for all points @xmath93 of the lattice . to extract @xmath1 , the square deviation from the schramm formula @xmath94 at any point of the lattice @xmath95",

    "the latter is then determined numerically by searching for the root of the derivative of the 4th - order polynomial .",
    "an example of this procedure is shown on figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "for the largest lattice size @xmath49 , the mean square deviation is minimal for @xmath99 .",
    "the monitoring of @xmath100 shows that for this value of @xmath1 , the square deviation is of order @xmath101 in the right third of the lattice ( figure [ fig4a ] ) .",
    "the square of the statistical error @xmath102 is of the same order . the left - right asymmetry due to the loops",
    "is clearly seen : @xmath103 is larger by two orders of magnitude in the left part of the lattice .",
    "the much better agreement of the data with the schramm formula in the right third of the lattice justifies _ a - posteriori _ the restriction of the interpolation to this region .    on figure [ fig5 ] ( left ) , @xmath1 is plotted versus the number of disorder realizations taken into account in the average for different lattice sizes .",
    "no abrupt jump that would be the signature of rare events with large contribution is observed .",
    "the estimates of @xmath1 after @xmath104 disorder realizations are compatible within statistical fluctuations for lattice sizes larger than 128 .",
    "our final estimate is @xmath3 . for small lattice sizes",
    ", @xmath1 takes a value close to 10/3 , i.e. the one of the pure 3-state potts model , suggesting that a cross - over between the pure and the random fixed points occurs for @xmath105 .",
    "the data have been analyzed using other fractions of the lattice .",
    "the estimate of @xmath1 tends to increase when going from a large fraction of the lattice to a smaller one  : @xmath106 for an interpolation over the right half of the lattice , @xmath107 for an interpolation over the right quarter of the lattice .",
    "a compromise has to be found between a too large fraction for which systematic deviations due to loops may be important and a too small fraction where lattice effects due to the boundaries are important .",
    "we note that , as expected , apllying blindly the interpolation procedure to the whole lattice gives a significantly different estimate @xmath108 .    like for the case of the interface length",
    ", we still need to show that a small variation of the disorder amplitude will not induce a large variation of @xmath1 so that @xmath1 would still be compatible with the estimate @xmath109 obtained from the scaling of the interface length .",
    "simulations have been made for other disorder amplitudes @xmath57 but only for lattice sizes @xmath110 and with 3000 disorder realizations .",
    "we have shown in the case of @xmath66 that this lattice size still leads to a small overestimate of @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , it should be possible to get a correct order of magnitude of the variation of @xmath1 with @xmath57 . as shown on figure [ fig6 ] , this variation remains small . with a linear interpolation",
    ", one can estimate this variation to be @xmath111 .",
    "although our interface presents loops due to the use of a simple right - turn tie - breaking algorithm , we have shown that they do not affect the scaling dimension of the interface in the pure case . however , systematic deviations between the left - passage probability and the schramm formula were observed .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 can be nevertheless estimated by restricting the interpolation to the right part of the lattice . in the case of the 3-state random bond potts model",
