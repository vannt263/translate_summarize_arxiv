    "rectangular cavities are perhaps the most frequently studied geometries in connection with vacuum ( casimir ) energy . nevertheless , there are still worthwhile things to say about them .",
    "although exactly solvable , they exhibit many features that are subjects of current research and debate in the broader context of quantum vacuum energy : boundary divergences , corner effects , sometimes surprising signs , and sometimes revealing connections with geometry through the spectrum of periodic and other closed classical paths ( or optical rays ) .",
    "a complete listing of previous literature is impossible , but we summarize what we see as the most important historical developments .",
    "lukosz @xcite calculated the interior vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field in a ( 3d ) perfectly conducting parallelepiped , using zeta - function regularization , and predicted a repulsive ( outward ) force for many aspect ratios , including the cube .",
    "ambjrn and wolfram @xcite extended such calculations to a wide variety of dimensions , fields , and boundary conditions .",
    "actor @xcite emphasized that divergences in the total energy must be understood in terms of the local behavior of the field near boundaries and boundary singularities ( edges and corners ) , and calculated the local zeta function for the 3d scalar field . for earlier ,",
    "closely related discussions of a rectangular waveguide and various other systems , see @xcite .",
    "all these works were done in the framework of zeta functions  @xcite , but in practice , in the special case of rectangular cavities , functional equations for epstein zeta functions are used to convert zeta - regularized sums over eigenvalues into what are , in effect , zeta - regularized sums over classical paths .",
    "( in @xcite a transition to an ultraviolet cutoff was also made at this step . )    the calculation of vacuum energy via classical paths ( also called optical rays ) @xcite leads naturally to more physical regularizations associated with separation of points in the green functions of the theory . for rectangular parallelepipeds",
    "such calculations are exact ( no stationary - phase approximations are required ) and reduce to the classic method of images .",
    "although they did not discuss vacuum energy , balian and bloch @xcite used the 3d parallelepiped as a principal example in their landmark study of the relation between periodic orbits and oscillations in the eigenvalue density , and their catalog of periodic and other closed orbits is the best starting point for a study of the rectangle .",
    "hacyan et al .",
    "@xcite calculated the full stress tensor for the electromagnetic field in a box by a green - function approach ; along the way , they showed how to reduce the electromagnetic problem to scalar fields with mixed dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions via hertz potentials . in this connection",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "( contrary to the impression left by some papers on the global problem , a local investigation of electromagnetism can not be split into pure dirichlet and pure neumann problems , even when a decomposition into te and tm modes exists . )    at this point we should mention the work of ford and svaiter @xcite , which showed that physically motivated cutoffs could convert divergences into finite effects clearly localized near boundaries .",
    "this theme has been repeatedly visited since then @xcite and will play a major role in the present work .",
    "cavalcanti @xcite rejuvenated the field by introducing the piston model ( for a 2d scalar field ) , discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : piston ] and illustrated in fig  [ fig : piston ] .",
    "( similar ideas were advanced earlier by svaiter et al .  @xcite . )",
    "the motivation for the piston is that the calculation of the force on the piston plate is unaffected by either uncompensated divergences or unknown forces from the exterior .",
    "the conclusion of @xcite is that the force is always attractive ( inward ) . that paper used both zeta and cutoff regularization , but still starting from the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "hertzberg et al .",
    "@xcite extended the piston model to dimension  3 and to the electromagnetic field , and they analyzed it in terms of closed paths ( but without the close attention to locally defined quantities that we provide here ) . from that point of view ,",
    "the repulsive nature of the lukosz force is attributable to a particular type of path moving parallel to the plate and producing an energy proportional to the piston displacement .",
    "( it is essentially the casimir energy associated with the walls perpendicular to the movable plate . ) but such energy is also present in the exterior part of the piston shaft , and therefore these paths make no net contribution to the force .",
    "what is left of the lukosz force is attractive .",
    "this effect shows up even more clearly in the two - dimensional model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : piston ] ) .",
    "rodriguez et al .",
    "@xcite have made a numerical study of two conducting rectangular objects in a narrow passage , a model closely akin to the pistons and pistols we discuss here .",
    "they conclude that the distance to the confining walls influences the attraction between the blocks , and their analysis makes use of the local stress tensor . in @xcite that model is approached by the method of closed optical paths .    illuminating",
    "though the piston has been , it does not settle the original issue of the physical reality of the force calculated by lukosz @xcite and others .",
    "the existence of a casimir - like energy in the exterior part of the piston shaft says nothing about what happens when that part of the shaft is removed , the plate remaining free to move ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : looselid ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : pistol - d ] ) .",
    "the `` finite part '' of that force is robust , in the sense that all reasonable prescriptions for calculating it give the same answer .",
    "it can be obtained by differentiating the total energy , or by integrating the pressure over the movable boundary .",
    "it can be obtained by zeta - function regularization or by ultraviolet cutoffs , and within the latter framework the choice of cutoff function dictates the relative sizes of the cutoff - dependent terms but not the structure of the series nor the numerical value of the finite term ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) .",
    "is the object of this consensus a meaningless number ?",
    "one of our goals is to investigate to what extent it has physical significance .",
    "the opinion expressed in @xcite is that `` without [ the piston shaft ] ( or some open region that allows rigid motion of the partition ) the casimir energy of the parallelepiped is , in fact , cutoff dependent .",
    "if the cutoff dependence is somehow ignored , a repulsive force   remains as an artifact . ''",
    "we agree that a correct calculation of the force on the piston must include the effect of the piston shaft , and that the net effect is attractive .",
    "we do not agree that the repulsive force associated with the interior can be dismissed as an artifact of naively discarding a divergent term .",
    "the scenario indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : looselid ] , a box with a movable lid , is a well - defined problem of relative motion of rigid bodies , just as much as the piston is ; cutoff - dependent energies associated with the rigid boundaries can not affect the force .",
    "the difficulties of analyzing fig .",
    "[ fig : looselid ] are , first , that the effects of the corners and gaps in that geometry are hard to calculate ( see , however , @xcite and , on a different tack , @xcite ) , and , second , that the idealized casimir theory is not physically applicable to very small separations of the bodies .",
    "we evade the first problem by considering another scenario , the `` pistol '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pistol ] ) , which should still exhibit the uncompensated lukosz force on a flat boundary . however , we find that the situation is then confounded by a strong countervailing attractive force associated with the casimir energy in the narrow gap surrounding the `` bullet '' . moreover ,",
    "one now runs up against the second problem , which can not be treated seriously within the limits of our methodology .",
    "a crude model of a `` real '' boundary can be easily obtained , however , by maintaining a finite cutoff of atomic dimensions .",
    "the result is that the force depends sensitively on how tightly the `` bullet '' fits into the `` barrel '' .",
    "if the fit is loose , the lukosz force is overwhelmed by the corresponding force associated with the gap surrounding the bullet , and the net force is attractive . if the fit is tight , the gap force can be made repulsive or even fine - tuned to vanish , as originally hoped ; unfortunately , that is the regime in which one is least justified in taking the model seriously .",
    "all we claim is that external forces opposing the lukosz force are model - dependent and might , in principle , be controlled so as to demonstrate the existence of the lukosz force .    in this paper",
    "we consider strictly the two - dimensional scalar field , usually with dirichlet boundary conditions , although we sometimes lapse into the three - dimensional electromagnetic terminology ( such as `` conductor '' ) for conceptual discussions .",
    "it is intended that three - dimensional generalizations will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "[ sec : local ] presents a thorough analysis , by means of classical paths , of all components of the stress ( energy - momentum ) tensor in a rectangle .",
    "[ sec : global ] does the same for the energy and also the pressure and force on one side .",
    "contributions are recorded for each path ( or class of similar paths ) separately , with comments on their physical or geometrical significance to the extent that we can discern it .",
    "the results are stated for all values of the curvature , or conformal , coupling constant , @xmath2 ( see ( [ lagrangian ] ) and ( [ stresst ] ) ) , and all values of the parameter in an exponential ultraviolet cutoff . for the most part",
    ", they are stated for any combination of dirichlet and neumann conditions on the four sides of the box .",
    "a brief account of this part of the work was published previously  @xcite , along with evidence that the gravitational effects of boundaries in the `` renormalized '' theory without cutoff can be understood ( and believed ) as the distributional limit of the predictions of the cutoff theory , thereby providing a true renormalization . in the rest of the paper we restrict to the dirichlet condition .",

    "[ sec : pistol - c ] investigates the pistol with a finite cutoff .",
    "_ a remark on terminology : _ many authors , including some of ourselves on previous occasions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , use the term `` renormalized energy '' to refer to the finite part of a regularized energy when the latter is expanded as a series in the cutoff parameter .",
    "strictly speaking , `` renormalization '' refers to the process of obtaining physically observable probability amplitudes by absorbing suitable divergent and finite contributions into redefinitions of physical parameters ( couplings , masses , etc.)appearing in the bare lagrangian .",
    "ideally , all renormalizations in the first sense should either be associated with renormalizations in the second sense or be justified by cancellations of divergent terms coming from different sources . yet in the absence of a completed theory , one must often talk about renormalization in the first sense without having an obvious counterterm or cancellation , and there seems to be no convenient substitute terminology .",
    "much of our work in this paper has to do , in fact , with exhibiting cancellations , and @xcite and its planned sequels have to do with gravitational counterterms .",
    "when we use `` renormalization '' or `` renormalized '' in the first sense , we have always either put the word in quotation marks or accompanied it by the word `` naive '' , depending on context .",
    "we are concerned here with the massless scalar wave equation @xmath3 in a cavity @xmath4 together with a dirichlet ( @xmath5 ) or neumann ( @xmath6 ) condition on each part of the boundary of  @xmath4 .",
    "we write @xmath7 for the corresponding positive self - adjoint operator : @xmath8 with boundary conditions understood .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath7 are positive , with the possible exception ( in the totally neumann case ) of a constant eigenfunction with eigenvalue zero .",
    "the formulas in this subsection are presented for arbitrary spatial dimension  @xmath9 , but in the next section we specialize to @xmath10 .",

    "different values of @xmath2 are different theories ; after the reduction to flat space the field equation is independent of  @xmath2 , but the stress tensors are different .",
    "it turns out [ see ( [ t00 ] ) ] that changing @xmath2 changes @xmath20 only by a divergence , and therefore the total energy @xmath21 is independent of @xmath2 , at least classically , under dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "( a robin boundary condition @xcite , @xmath22 , would require a boundary term to be added to the action ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "there results a @xmath2-dependent boundary term in @xmath23 , which vanishes when @xmath24 .",
    "similar remarks apply to models with delta function potentials @xcite . )",
    "there are three natural choices of  @xmath2 :    @xmath25 : minimal coupling , which simplifies the lagrangian and curved - space field equation ;    @xmath26 : conformal coupling , @xmath27 which results in the mildest behavior of the quantized field near the boundary ;    @xmath28 : the coupling that eliminates the robin boundary energy , which also simplifies the relation between the stress tensor and the total energy , as we shall see .",

    "generalizations and variations of this model have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the piston model is not without its own physical problems , because interactions between the piston plate and the horizontal sides have been ignored . in a realistic experiment , because of ordinary casimir attraction the plate would be unstable to striking the tube wall on edge , after which it would collapse against one of the walls of the tube .",
    "it may be argued that this objection is irrelevant to the question of principle that the piston model is designed to address ; the only degree of freedom one is varying is  @xmath78 , so it is legitimate to imagine that the plate is constrained from moving in any other degree of freedom .",

    "nevertheless , in a real apparatus there would surely be some friction with the walls , so the feasibility of an experiment to verify the piston analysis is questionable .",

    "cavalcanti @xcite rendered ( [ pistforce ] ) more illuminating by subjecting it to further analysis . if one refrains from the @xmath238 simplification , the complete sum over periodic paths in the ( @xmath58 ) energy , ( [ perenergy ] ) , is @xmath239 from this one can derive two complementary formulas , useful in the respective regimes @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",

    "( a recent independent investigation @xcite likewise shows a system maximizing the length of a small gap between flat surfaces . ) moreover , in addition to the attractive force between the plates , there is a torque exerted on one thin plate above a larger plate which tends to cause a rotation of the smaller plate about its center of mass so as to favor perpendicular orientation .",
    "details have been reported in  @xcite .",
    "since these qualitative conclusions are essentially geometrical , they should also hold for strong coupling ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) .",
    "finally , let us try to confirm the foregoing conclusions by looking at pressure integrals . in principle , one can find the total force on the bullet by integrating the appropriate components of @xmath254 over the surface of the bullet ( or even some larger surrounding surface @xcite ) .",

    "so , one would conclude that the pistol fires after all !",
    "we believe that the resolution of this new paradox is that the crude approximations listed above , although they _ may _ be permissible for the energy calculation , are simply wrong for the pressure calculation .",
    "in particular , if the casimir ( or the lukosz ) formulas were accurate over the entire gap rectangle , there would be finite jumps at the end surfaces of the gap in @xmath233 ( which is constant and large in the gap , constant and smaller in the chamber , and zero in the exterior , in our approximations ) . by the conservation law",

    "the mathematical reason why the theorem of bachas @xcite does nt apply is less clear , but the key physical point is clear from that author s remarks ( p.  9094 ) that a `` quantized particle does not , strictly speaking , live in one side of the reflecting plane , '' and that the theorem would apply at the quantum level only if ( in the terms of our scenario ) one of the slabs were made of antimatter .",
    "the repulsion occurs only at separations of the order of the interatomic spacing .",

    ". forces ( which are independent of @xmath2 ) have been consistently calculated both by differentiating energy and by integrating pressure .",
    "studying the local energy density and stresses ( rather than just total energy ) , using a physically motivated ultraviolet cutoff ( rather than an `` analytic '' regularization scheme ) , and studying separately the contributions from various classes of specularly reflecting paths all help to interpret the physics , especially the roles of boundaries and corners . within a cutoff framework one",
    "has a clear and consistent definition of energy densities and forces .",
    "when different configurations of rigid bodies are compared and all contributions ( from inside and outside ) are included , one always finds a cancellation of the energy divergences and hence an unambiguous force in the limit of no cutoff .",
    "the decomposition by paths helps one to understand better the cancellations of divergent terms and often to understand intuitively the sign of the casimir force .",
    "most strikingly , the force on one side of the rectangle includes important repulsive components associated with paths _",
    "parallel _ to that side : a divergent term from short paths that reflect from the perpendicular sides , and a finite , constant term from periodic paths between the two perpendicular sides . in piston",
    "geometries these forces are cancelled by counterpart terms from the exterior of the rectangle , but in more general circumstances the problem of their physical interpretation must be taken seriously .    in the later sections of the paper we discuss geometries in which the vacuum forces from inside a rectangle might be rigorously exhibited . the box with a loose lid ( fig .",

    "the force on the pistol depends sensitively on the cutoff length , as compared to the width of the gap between the bullet and the barrel .",
    "the only regime in which our quantitative analysis ( extrapolated to 3d electromagnetism ) can be regarded as physically trustworthy is that where the gap is small but still larger than the cutoff ; there the behavior is cutoff - independent but the force is attractive .",
    "scenarios where the net force is repulsive ( in particular , one where the gap force vanishes ) do exist , but require entering the regime where the calculations can not be taken seriously on a quantitative level because one does not know what the correct ultraviolet cutoff behavior is ( and because stiction and friction are likely to be the dominant effects there ) ; furthermore , making the gap force zero or small requires fine tuning within this regime . nevertheless ,",
    "although no quantitative claims can be made for our model ( pistol + cutoff ) in that regime , we do submit that the model is closer to the physical truth than either a model without cutoff ( which would predict infinite energies ) or an analytic regularization that hides the divergences from the beginning .",
    "furthermore , while the repulsive lukosz component of the force is robust , the force opposing it is dependent on the scenario considered ( e.g. , piston vs.  pistol , or wide gap vs.  narrow ) and could in principle be controlled to demonstrate the reality of the lukosz force , even if the _",
