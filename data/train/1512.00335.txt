    "neutrino was proposed by w. pauli in 1930 to explain the continuous @xmath7 spectrum that had been observed .",
    "however , its detection was not realized until 26 years later : in 1956 neutrino was first detected in the savannah river experiment led by f. reines and c. cowan .",
    "today we know that there are three types or flavors of active neutrinos ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , and we also know neutrinos have masses ( with mass eigenstates @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 )",
    ". nevertheless , the neutrino flavor eigenstates are not their mass eigenstates . from the quantum mechanics , we know that neutrinos oscillate : the flavor components of the neutrinos will change as they propagate .",
    "the neutrino flavor and mass eigenstates can be bridged as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent neutrino flavor and mass eigenstates , respectively .",
    "u is a 3 @xmath4 3 unitary matrix called pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix that has the form of @xmath17 the pmns matrix contains three neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) and one phase ( @xmath21 ) , and the @xmath21 could lead to the cp violation . for the daya bay experiment , we focused on the measurement of the @xmath19 neutrino mixing angle using electron anti - neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) produced from reactors .",
    "the @xmath19 can be extracted by measuring the @xmath0 survial probability after they propagate for certain distance , which has the form of @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the neutrino energy , @xmath25 is the neutrino propagation distance , and @xmath26 = @xmath27 - @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "reactors mainly produce electron anti - neutrinos through the fissions of four isotopes ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) . on average ,",
    "each fission can produce @xmath34 6 electron anti - neutrinos and release @xmath34 200 mev thermal energy .",
    "hence for a 1 gigawatts ( gw ) thermal power reactor , it produces @xmath342 @xmath4 10@xmath35 electron anti - neutrinos per second with most neutrino energies below 8 mev .    the detection of reactor anti - neutrinos is through the inverse beta decay ( ibd ) :",
    "@xmath0 + p @xmath36 e@xmath37 + n that requires the @xmath0 s energy larger than 1.8 mev .",
    "the ionization and annihilation of e@xmath37 in liquid scintillator forms a prompt signal , while the neutron will first get thermalized and then be captured by some nucleus and form a delayed signal . in the daya bay experiment , gd is used to capture ibd neutrons . when a neutron is captured by gd",
    ", it will release several gamma rays with total energy @xmath34 8 mev .",
    "the mean time difference between prompt and delayed signals is @xmath34 30 @xmath38s .",
    "the coincidence of the prompt and the delayed signals forms a distinctive signature for ibd .    in march , 2012 , daya bay discovered a non - zero @xmath1 with 5.2 @xmath39 significance using 55 days of data@xcite and provided the most precise measurement of this parameter at that time . with 217 days of data ,",
    "daya bay updated the results in 2014 with a relative @xmath0 rate and spectrum analysis to measure both the @xmath1 and the oscillation frequency @xmath40 @xcite . in this article , we report the most recent results from daya bay using 621 days of data@xcite , which has 3.6 more times of statistics than our previous published results@xcite .",
    "the daya bay neutrino experiment is located inside the daya bay nuclear power plant facility that is in the suburb of shenzhen , guangdong province , china .",
    "the daya bay experiment detects the electron anti - neutrinos produced from six 2.9 gw thermal power commericial reactors , daya bay nuclear power plants ( two reactors ) , ling ao i nuclear power plants ( two reactors ) and ling ao ii nuclear power plants ( two reactors ) , using eight functional identical anti - neutrino detectors ( ads ) .",
    "the ads are placed in three underground experimental halls , two near halls ( eh1 and eh2 ) and one far hall ( eh3 ) .",
    "eh1 , which hosts two ads , is 363 m away from daya bay nuclear power plants and has an overburden of 250 meter water equivalent ( m.w.e . ) .",
    "eh2 , with 265 m.w.e .",
    "overburden , also has two ads and is about 500 m from ling ao i and ii nuclear power plants .",
    "the other four ads are located in eh3 , which has an overburden of 860 m.w.e . and is 1615 and 1958 m from ling ao i and daya bay nuclear power plants , respectively .",
    "the ad used in the daya bay experiment is a 3-zone cylindrical shaped detector .",
    "the inner most part is a 3 @xmath4 3 m dimension inner acrylic vessel ( iav ) that holds 20 tons of gd doped liquid scintilltor ( gd - ls ) which is used as the detection target .",
    "the iav is surrounded by 20 tons of none doped liquid scintillator ( ls ) that is used to capture the @xmath41 rays leaked from gd - ls region .",
    "the ls is holded by a 4 @xmath4 4 m outer acrylic vessel ( oav ) .",
    "the outmost region is a 5 @xmath4 5 m stainless steel vessel ( ssv ) which contains 40 tons of mineral oil ( mo ) to shield the gd - ls and ls regions from the radioactivities produced by pmt glasses and the stainless steel .",
    "each ad contains 192 8-inch pmts that mounted on the side wall of ssv .",
    "two optical reflectors are placed at the top and the bottom of ssv to increase the effective detector photo coverage to 12% .",
    "160 photoelectrons are collected per mev on average which leads to the detector energy resolution of @xmath348%/@xmath42 .",
    "three automated calibration units ( acus ) are mounted on the top of ssv lid which are used to calibrate the detector gd - ls center and edge as well as ls regions along three vertical axes .",
    "each acu contains a led diffuser ball that is used to calibrate the pmt gain and timing , and three calibration sources : @xmath43ge , @xmath44co and @xmath45am@xmath46c for @xmath41 rays and neutron .",
    "the calibration is performed weekly to all 8 ads simultaneously . besides weekly calibration using acu sources , during the summer of 2012",
    "a special calibration campaign was performed on eh1 s two ads using @xmath47cs , @xmath48mn , @xmath49k , @xmath45am@xmath50be and @xmath51pu@xmath46c sources .",
    "in addition , a manual calibration system ( mcs ) was installed on eh1-ad1 during this period , which allows for the full volume calibration of the detector . also , @xmath41 and @xmath52 peaks that from the radioactivities of the ls ( @xmath49k,@xmath53tl , @xmath54po , @xmath55po and @xmath56po ) and neutron captured on h , c and fe are included in the calibration .",
    "overall the relative energy scale , the difference of the reconstructed energies between ads , is less than 0.2% for all sources .",
    "the ads in each experimental hall are submerged in a purified water pool with at least 2.5 m of water coverage in all directions .",
    "the water pool is optically separated to 2-zone : inner water pool ( iwp ) and outer water pool ( owp ) , by a layer of tyvek .",
    "the water pool is used as a cherenkov detetor to veto cosmic muons as well as to shield the ads from the radioactivities that come from the surrounding rock .",
    "each water pool is covered with 4-layer resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) that can provide additional muon tagging information .",
    "the detector energy nonlinearity , or relative scintillator response to different energies of different types of particles ( such as e@xmath37 , e@xmath57 and @xmath41 ) , is important to the interpretation of the observed prompt energy spectra .",
    "there are two major sources that cause the detector nonlinearity response between the true energy and the reconstructed energies of a particle : the scintillator nonlinerity and the pmt read out electronics nonlinearity .",
    "the scintillator nonlinearity is due to the scintillator quenching effect , which can be described by birk s law , and the cherenkov light emission .",
    "the electronic nonlinearity is due to the interaction of the scintillation light time profile and the charge measurement scheme of the front - end electronics , which is modeled with monte carlo and measurement from single channel fadc in the daya bay experiment .",
    "the detector nonlinearity is correlated among all ads , and is constrained to be @xmath34 1% in the daya bay experiment . for more information about daya bay experiment and its detector system , please check @xcite .",
    "the daya bay experiment started to take data from december 2011 with 6-ad configuration , two ads at eh1 , one ad at eh2 and three ads at eh3 , and this period last for 217 days until july 2012 .",
    "in the summer of 2012 , two new ads were installed : one at eh2 and the other at eh3 . from then on",
    ", the daya bay experiment is running with full 8-ad configuration . in the following sections",
    ", we will present the recent results from daya bay using 621 days of data : 217 days data with 6-ad configuration and 404 days data with 8-ad configuration .",
    "to remove the irrelevant events and select the real ibd events that caused by the neutrinos , several cuts were applied to our ibd candidates .",
    "first of all , we removed the events that caused by pmt flashers : the light spontaneously emitted from pmt .",
    "then we required the prompt and delayed energies of the ibd candidates to fall into the ranges of 0.7 - 12 mev and 6 - 12 mev , respectively .",
    "the prompt and delayed signals were also required to form a coincidence within a time window of 1 - 200 @xmath38s . to remove the events that caused by cosmic muons , muon veto cuts were applied .",
    "events were removed if the delayed signal occurs within 600 @xmath38s after a water pool muon was detected , or the delayed signal happens within 1 ms after a reconstructed signal with energy @xmath58 20 mev in ad , or the delayed signal within 1 s after a reconstructed signal with energy @xmath58 2.5 gev in ad . finally , to further remove ambiguity ,",
    "a multiplicity cut is applied to select only a single candidate pairs within each cut window .",
    "the cut efficiency for the above mentioned cuts is 80.6% @xmath2 2.1% @xmath2 0.2% , where the 2.1% and 0.2% are corresponding to the correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties . during the 621 days of data taking",
    ", we totally collected more than 1 million ibd events with @xmath34150 k events at far ads . the time dependent ibd rates are strongly correlated with the reactor @xmath0 flux expectation .",
    "the daya bay experiment is a low background experiment .",
    "there are five major backgrounds in the daya bay experiment that could mimic the ibd .",
    "the largest background is accidental background , which accounts for 2.3% and 1.4% of the candidates in the far and near halls , respectively .",
    "however , the accidental background can be statistically removed with high precision .",
    "the second and third backgrouns are from @xmath50li/@xmath59he and fast neutrons that are generated from the cosmic muons account for 0.4% and 0.1% at both halls , respectively .",
    "the fourth background is due to the natural radioactivities within the liquid scintillator , which accounts for 0.01% and 0.1% at near and far halls .",
    "the last background is due to our @xmath45am@xmath46c calibration source , which is largely reduced during the 8-ad configuration period due to the removal of off - center @xmath45am@xmath46c sources at eh3 during the summer of 2012 .",
    "the total background amount to 2% and 3% of the ibd candidates for the near and far halls .",
