    "high transverse momentum jets produced in heavy - ion collisions represent a valuable tool for studies of the properties of the hot parton plasma produced in the central rapidity region  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that jets couple to the plasma causing the jet to broaden in momentum space and to lose energy .",
    "the magnitude of momentum - space broadening and energy loss experienced by a parton depends on whether or not one assumes the matter to be hadronic or partonic in nature .",
    "hence , it is one of the primary observables to ascertain experimentally whether or not the plasma has been produced . at very high energies",
    "it is expected that hard bremsstrahlung processes dominate the light quark or gluon energy loss  @xcite ; however , at intermediate energies the inclusion of both collisional and radiative processes is necessary in order to make phenomenological predictions .",
    "here we present first results from real - time solution of the su(2 ) boltzmann - vlasov equation for locally isotropic and anisotropic plasmas which include both hard ( scattering ) and soft ( classical field ) processes .",
    "we first demonstrate that in a locally isotropic plasma , one can obtain a cutoff - independent transport coefficient @xmath0 , which measures the square of the transverse momentum transfer per mean free path .",
    "this measurement lays the groundwork for determining other jet transport properties like the energy - loss spectrum from real - time simulations .",
    "we then perform a similar measurement in a locally anisotropic plasma and demonstrate that for a non - abelian plasma unstable modes can cause asymmetric broadening of jets . this may be relevant for recent measurements of di - hadron correlations which provide evidence for an _ asymmetric _ broadening of jet profiles in the plane of pseudorapidity ( @xmath7 ) and azimuthal angle ( @xmath8 ) , with @xmath9 , which has been called `` the ridge '' by experimentalists  @xcite . here",
    "we will show that this asymmetry could partly be caused by unstable plasma modes which are induced by the longitudinal expansion of the plasma .    at the earliest times after an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision , before thermalization and hydrodynamic expansion , the plasma undergoes rapid longitudinal expansion .",
    "this expansion can lead to an oblate anisotropic ( @xmath10 ) momentum distribution in the local rest frame  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that instabilities develop  @xcite in such anisotropic plasmas which lead to the formation of long - wavelength chromo - magnetic and chromo - electric fields .",
    "these fields can then affect the propagation of hard jets and their induced hard radiation field .",
    "in the abelian case soft transverse magnetic fields , @xmath11 , dominate all other field components and therefore in this case one expects the longitudinal pressure induced by unstables modes to be larger than the transverse pressure  @xcite .",
    "this pressure asymmetry causes asymmetric broadening of jets with larger broadening along the longitudinal or @xmath7 direction .",
    "the situation is more complicated in non - abelian plasmas since then , in addition to generating large coherent @xmath11 and @xmath12 domains , one also generates large - amplitude longitudinal fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is therefore not obvious a priori that the pressure generated by other field components will result in an asymmetric broadening of the jet . through our numerical simulations we find that for oblate parton momentum distributions , that at different times either @xmath3 or @xmath15 with the net effect being a factor of 1.5 stronger longitudinal than transverse broadening",
    "we solve the classical transport equation for hard gluons with su(2 ) color charge @xmath16  @xcite , with the color generators @xmath17 , including hard binary collisions @xmath18f={\\cal c}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the single - particle phase space distribution .",
    "it is coupled self - consistently to the yang - mills equation for the soft gluon fields , @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "when the phase - space density is parametrically small , @xmath22 , the collision term is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath24 includes all @xmath25 tree - level diagrams and color factors as appropriate for the su(2 ) gauge group .",
    "we employ the test particle method to replace the continuous distribution @xmath26 by a large number of test particles , which leads to wong s equations  @xcite @xmath27\\,,\\label{wong3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath28-th test particle , whose coordinates are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the time evolution of the yang - mills field is determined by the standard hamiltonian method @xcite in @xmath32 gauge .",
    "our lattices have periodic boundary conditions and a lattice spacing @xmath33 , whose physical value is fixed by the length of the lattice @xmath34 .",
    "dimensionless lattice variables scale such that when the number @xmath35 of lattice sites is changed , @xmath36 remains fixed ; see  @xcite for details .",
    "the theory without collisions as given by equations  ( [ wong1]-[wong3 ] ) coupled to the lattice yang - mills equations was first solved in ref .",
    "@xcite to study chern - simons number diffusion in non - abelian gauge theories at finite temperature .",
    "it was applied later also to the problem of gauge - field instabilities in anisotropic su(2 ) plasmas  @xcite .",
    "our numerical implementation is based on the improved formulation detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the non - abelian currents generated by the hard particle modes on the lattice sites are `` smeared '' in time .",
    "this technique makes simulations in three dimensions on large lattices possible in practice .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond those earlier simulations by accounting also for hard ( short - distance ) collisions among particles .",
    "the collision term is incorporated using the stochastic method @xcite .",
    "scattering processes are determined by sampling possible transitions according to the collision rate in a lattice cell : @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the invariant mass of a gluon pair .",
    "the total cross section is given by @xmath40 the momentum transfer is determined in the center of mass frame of the two colliding particles from the probability distribution @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ totcross ] ) we have introduced an infrared cutoff @xmath42 for point - like binary collisions . to avoid double - counting , this cutoff should be on the order of the hardest field mode that can be represented on the given lattice , @xmath43 .",
    "momentum transfers below @xmath42 are mediated by the classical yang - mills field ; a soft scattering corresponds to deflection of a particle in the field of the other(s ) .",
    "note , that we use the color averaged expression for the collision term .",
    "the color charge of a particle is hence not affected by a hard collision .",
    "physically , the separation scale @xmath42 should be sufficiently small so that the soft field modes below @xmath42 are highly occupied  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath42 should be sufficiently large to ensure that hard modes can be represented by particles and that collisions are described correctly by eq.([cterm1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , unstable modes arise in anisotropic plasmas ( see below ) , all of which should be located below @xmath42 . since @xmath44 , in practice , we choose @xmath45 to be on the order of the temperature for isotropic systems , and on the order of the hard transverse momentum scale for anisotropic plasmas . independently , one should have @xmath46 and @xmath47 : the first condition ensures that the relevant soft modes actually fit on the lattice while the latter corresponds to the continuum limit . here",
    ", @xmath48 denotes the soft scale and is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of colors and @xmath51 denotes the number density of hard gluons , summed over two helicities and @xmath52 colors .",
    "also , @xmath53 is the typical momentum of a hard particle from the medium .    as we have argued above",
    ", we shall choose the inverse lattice spacing to be on the order of the temperature of the medium .",
    "thus , with  ( [ minf ] ) the continuum condition @xmath54 roughly translates into @xmath55 in order to satisfy this relation with @xmath44 , in our numerical simulations below we shall assume an extremely hot medium , @xmath56 . however , this should be viewed simply as a numerical procedure which ensures that the simulations are carried out near the continuum ( or weak - coupling ) limit .",
    "we shall verify below that transverse momentum broadening of a high - energy jet passing through a thermal medium is independent of @xmath57 if the density and the ratio of jet momentum to temperature is fixed ; compare to eq.([<kt2>ll ] ) below .",
    "one may therefore obtain a useful `` weak - coupling '' estimate of @xmath58 ( resp .  for the related transport coefficient @xmath0 ) by extrapolating our measurements down to realistic temperatures .",
    "we first consider a heat - bath of particles with a density of @xmath59 and an average particle momentum of @xmath60  gev .",
    "the rather extreme `` temperature '' is chosen to satisfy the above conditions on @xmath61 lattices , assuming @xmath62  fm . for a given lattice ( resp .",
    "@xmath42 ) we take the initial energy density of the thermalized fields to be @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a bose distribution normalized to the assumed particle density @xmath51 , and @xmath65 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "this is equivalent to the energy density of bose - distributed particles with momenta below the separation momentum @xmath42 .",
    "the initial spectrum is fixed to coulomb gauge and @xmath66 ( in continuum notation ) ; also , for simplicity we set @xmath67 at the initial time but electric fields build up quickly within just a few time steps .",
    "we then measure the momentum broadening @xmath68 of high - energy test particles ( @xmath69 ) passing through this medium .",
    "[ fig : ptnocoll ] shows that in the collisionless case , @xmath70 , the broadening is stronger on larger lattices , which accommodate harder field modes",

    "in heavy - ion collisions , locally anisotropic momentum distributions can emerge due to the longitudinal expansion .",

    "these latter runs are rather far from the continuum limit and lattice artifacts are significant  @xcite .",
    "the explanation for the larger broadening along the beam axis is as follows . in the abelian case the instability generates predominantly transverse magnetic fields which deflect the particles in the @xmath115-direction  @xcite .    ) at various times ; the gauge potentials were transformed to coulomb gauge.,width=264 ]    in the non - abelian case , however , on three - dimensional lattices transverse magnetic fields are much less dominant ( see , e.g.  fig .  5 in  @xcite ) although they do form larger coherent domains in the transverse plane at intermediate times than @xmath12 , fig .",

    "[ fig : ratios ] shows that @xmath3 , aside from @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the field configurations are such that particles are deflected preferentially in the longitudinal @xmath115-direction ( to restore isotropy ) .",
    "a third contribution to @xmath132 broadening in an expanding plasma , not considered explicitly here , is due to a longitudinal collective flow field which `` blows '' the jet fragments to the side  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is also available for collision dominated plasmas with ( nearly ) isotropic momentum distribution .",
    "however , rather strong flow gradients seem to be required to reproduce the observed broadening of midrapidity jets ( the flow velocity has to vary substantially _ within _ the narrow jet cone ) . in contrast",
    ", color fields will naturally deflect particles with lower momentum by larger angles ( @xmath133 ) : the jet profile broadens even if the induced radiation is exactly collinear .",
    "it is therefore important to determine , experimentally , whether the asymmetric broadening is related to the _ macroscopic _ collective flow or to an anisotropy of the plasma in the local rest frame .",
