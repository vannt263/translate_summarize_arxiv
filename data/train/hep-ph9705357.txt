    "it has recently been realized @xcite that an oscillating scalar field can transfer its energy efficiently to other bosonic degrees of freedom @xcite via a process analogous to the classical phenomenon of parametric resonance .",
    "the most important application of this mechanism is to reheating after inflation .",
    "when the inflationary stage terminates the universe is essentially devoid of matter and the inflaton field oscillates with large amplitude about the minimum of its potential .",
    "its coupling to other bosonic fields can then lead to explosive particle production via the non - perturbative resonance mechanism .",
    "this is sometimes called _ preheating _ in the literature because the produced particles are far from thermal equilibrium . the simplest model for studying",
    "this phenomenon is a theory with two real scalar fields and effective potential @xmath2 such models exhibit chaotic inflation when one of the fields , called the _ inflaton _ , acquires a large expectation value ( compared to the planck mass ) @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the universe then becomes dominated by the potential energy of the inflaton and the universe starts inflating .",
    "this continues until the amplitude of the inflaton expectation value becomes of order the planck mass .",
    "at this point the inflationary stage terminates and the inflaton starts oscillating .",

    "the most important features of the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mathieu ] ) are readily understood from the stability chart depicted in figures  1(a ) and  ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath13 curves divide the chart into stable ( dark ) and unstable ( light ) regions .",
    "some curves of constant positive @xmath14 are also shown .",
    "for clarity figure  1(a ) contains only a limited range of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , although the physically interesting values are @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 regime is called `` broad resonance '' in the literature .",
    "figure  1(b ) shows a piece of the instability chart for large @xmath19 around the line @xmath20 .",

    "the regions of large @xmath14 are excluded , and the maximum value @xmath14 reaches is @xmath23 , attained for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . above @xmath20 , @xmath14 is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath15 .",
    "since the separation between neighboring instability bands for large @xmath16 is of order @xmath26 , this implies that the dominant production of @xmath6 particles occurs for @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to note that the inflaton also decays into its own fluctuations _ via _ parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "however , the value of @xmath14 corresponding to this decay channel is typically a few times smaller than the value of @xmath14 for decay into @xmath6 fluctuations as long as @xmath16 is large .",
    "hence , unless the decay into @xmath6 particles is somehow shut off , the decay into @xmath3 particles is subdominant .",
    "while the above picture is simple and intuitive , in reality the situation is much more complex .",
    "first of all , the equations of motion ( eom ) , and hence the dynamics , are strongly modified in an expanding universe . in particular , the amplitude of the inflaton oscillations decreases even in the absence of particle production . secondly",
    ", as the inflaton decays , the backreaction of created particles alters the parameters in the mathieu equation .",
    "the amplitude decreases as energy is drained away and the masses get contributions of the form @xmath28 , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 denoting the variances of the fields .",

    "( [ eq : mathieu ] ) by time dependent parameters @xmath32 where @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the slowly varying amplitude of the oscillating inflaton expectation value @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the frequency of @xmath37 in the absence of backreaction",
    ". we distinguish @xmath36 from its initial value @xmath38 because due to the @xmath39 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) the frequency is time dependent even without decay in an expanding universe . the reason it is useful to think about the decay in terms of the parameters defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass and frequency ] ) is that the basic features of the resonance mechanism are extremely robust .",
    "the amplification of the modes depends only on the fact that one is dealing with oscillators with a time dependent frequency , and in what follows we will only make use of the most prominent features of the stability chart when obtaining analytical estimates . for large @xmath40",

    "( [ eq : mathieu ] ) finally breaks down completely when the resonant mode amplitudes grow large . for then the nonlinear terms in the eom become important and scatterings become fast .",
    "the result is a slowly evolving `` scattering regime '' characterized by smooth power spectra @xcite .",
    "the resonant decay of the inflaton has been treated in various approximations by many authors @xcite .",
    "the full nonlinear problem has been studied in detail using lattice simulations .",
    "the idea is that one can evolve the system using the classical equations of motion because the dynamics is dominated by states with large occupation numbers which admit a semiclassical description .",
    "this approach was pioneered in @xcite , where it was applied to the decay of a massless field into its own fluctuations .",
    "the decay into a second massless field with and without self - coupling was treated in @xcite , and the decay of a massive inflaton was discussed in @xcite .    our main interest in this paper is to investigate what happens when the coupling @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) is negative , which has not been previously studied .",
    "the point is that parameters like @xmath41 that couple two or more scalar fields appear in almost all extensions of the standard model , and that there is generally no reason whatsoever that these parameters should be positive .",
    "of course the effective potential should be bounded from below in order to ensure the existence of a sensible vacuum . for the potential given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) this requires @xmath42 we will assume that this stability bound is satisfied .    naively , as one can see from figure  1(a ) , the negative @xmath41 case is dramatically different from the positive @xmath41 case .",

    "this is easily orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding positive @xmath41 value , which is always @xmath23 .",
    "since the decay time is proportional to @xmath48 one might hence expect that particle production and consequently inflaton decay is much faster for negative @xmath41 .",
    "this conclusion , however , is premature since we have implicitly assumed that initially the expectation value @xmath49 . to see whether this is the case",
    "one has to examine the eom for the fields during inflation .",
    "note that the large expectation value @xmath37 of the inflaton induces a @xmath50-dependent minimum in the potential for the second field : @xmath51 it is not hard to see analytically that if @xmath52 initially , then it remains so during inflation , as long as @xmath53 and @xmath54 is not too large@xcite .",
    "our numerical simulations show that even if @xmath55 is not close to @xmath56 initially , it will become so by the end of inflation , provided the above conditions are satisfied .",

    "@xmath66 there is no such simple correspondence , but the effective @xmath40 is still positive .",
    "note that the effect of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correct chi mode equation ] ) is that it produces resonant growth of @xmath59 when the amplitude of @xmath67 is large and @xmath58 . since most of the time @xmath68 for the resonant modes ,",
    "the effect of this term will be small .",
    "the analogous term in the mode equation for @xmath67 speeds up its growth when @xmath59 is large .",
    "we have just seen that if @xmath55 follows its instantaneous equilibrium value @xmath56 the fact that @xmath41 is negative should not make much difference .",
    "the situation changes drastically if @xmath55 is not `` enslaved '' by @xmath50 in this way : there is then a portion of the period for which the term in parentheses of ( [ eq : correct chi mode equation ] ) is negative . during this time",
    "the @xmath59 are unstable and are expected to grow exponentially with large @xmath14 , just as in the naive negative @xmath41 picture discussed initially ( _ cf .",
    "_ also @xcite ) .",
    "the physics hence depends crucially on the detailed dynamics of the field expectation values .",
    "this dynamics is very complicated due to the interactions with the nonzero modes , especially once their amplitudes become large due to the resonance . to fully investigate the negative @xmath41 case",
    "one must hence resort to lattice simulations , and this is the subject we turn to next .",
    "in section  [ sec : massless ] we will discuss massless fields , followed by a detailed study of massive fields in section  [ sec : massive ] .",
    "the relevance of our results for grand unified theory ( gut ) baryogenesis are discussed in section  [ sec : baryogenesis ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "before diving into the analysis we should point out that most of our numerical calculations and analytical estimates will be concerned with obtaining the maximum variances attained by the fields during preheating .",
    "there are two reasons for focusing on these quantities : first , the maximum variances determine the symmetry restoration `` power '' relevant to the occurrence of so - called nonthermal phase transitions @xcite .",
    "second , for very massive particles such as the bosons needed for gut baryogenesis the variance is directly proportional to the energy and particle number densities .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in sections  [ sec : massive ] and [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we begin our investigation by studying massless fields , which is convenient for two reasons .",
    "first , the positive @xmath41 massless case has been studied extensively on the lattice in @xcite , allowing for a detailed comparison of the positive and negative @xmath41 cases .",
    "second , massless fields ( @xmath69 ) are the simplest to treat numerically because in this case the eom in a friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe are conformally equivalent to those in minkowski space . by this",
    "we mean the following : in terms of the variables @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the scale factor , the expanding universe eom reduce to those of two interacting scalar fields in static space - time @xcite .",
    "this is true provided the energy density behaves as radiation dominated , which is indeed the case for a massless inflaton in the oscillatory regime @xcite . since it is less time consuming to do simulations in minkowski space our numerics for the massless fields were done in terms of the barred variables defined above , and our lattice time was @xmath74 .",
    "the conversion of lattice quantities to physical quantities will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the computational techniques involved are described in detail in @xcite . in short",
    "we evolve the classical eom on a three dimensional lattice starting from certain random initial condition for the inhomogeneous modes @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for the zero modes ( field expectation values ) are given by the values at the breakdown of the slow roll inflationary stage : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath77 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi_0 ] ) .",
    "the results presented in this section were obtained on @xmath78 lattices .",
    "we begin by comparing the dynamics of two theories with opposite signs of @xmath41 but otherwise identical parameters .",
    "the chosen values are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . for a massless",
    "inflaton the zero mode @xmath50 oscillates with frequency @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "hence these couplings correspond to @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( _ cf .",
    "( [ eq : a , q ] ) , ( [ eq : r ] ) ) .",
    "the evolution of the expectation values @xmath50 and @xmath55 for the negative and positive @xmath41 cases are shown in figures  2 and  3 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding variances are shown in figures  4 and  5 .",
    "since the energy density in the inflaton zeromode is proportional to @xmath86 we see from figure  2 that in the negative @xmath41 case 40% of the initial energy is in fluctuations by the time @xmath87 .",
    "notice also that @xmath55 follows @xmath50 faithfully ( _ i.e. _ @xmath52 ) until @xmath88 .",
    "after this the two expectation values are no longer in phase , even though the dynamics of @xmath55 is clearly still strongly influenced by @xmath50 .",
    "figure  3 shows that it takes until @xmath89 for 40% of the energy to decay in the positive @xmath41 case , and in contrast to the situation for @xmath90 here almost all of the decayed energy goes into @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "after @xmath89 the decay rate becomes very small , a fact that is also reflected in the variances ( figure  5 ) , which are both changing very slowly beyond this point .",
    "similarly we see in figure  4 that for negative @xmath41 the variances level off at @xmath91 , although the @xmath3 variance is still growing slowly until @xmath92",
    ". we will explain all of these features , and give estimates for the magnitudes of the relevant quantities , in section  [ sec : masslessii ] .    before doing so",
    "let us briefly discuss the conversion of lattice quantities to physical quantities .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of this section , the lattice fields are rescaled by a factor @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the conformal time ( for convenience we define @xmath93 to correspond to the beginning of our simulation ( i.e.  the end of slow roll inflation ) and choose @xmath94 ) .",
    "this means that one must simply divide lattice quantities such as energy densities and variances by the appropriate powers of @xmath73 to get the physical values .",
    "for example , @xmath95 . in the oscillatory regime of a massless",
    "inflaton the scale factor behaves as in a radiation dominated universe , so we can write @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the hubble constant at the end of inflation .",
    "it is easy to show that at the end of slow roll @xmath98 and the kinetic energy density is about half the potential energy density @xcite .",
    "using the fact that @xmath99 for @xmath21 and @xmath100 for @xmath90 we thus obtain @xmath101 for @xmath21 and @xmath102 for @xmath90 .    with these estimates , and recalling that our lattice time is @xmath74 , it is simple to convert from lattice to physical quantities .",
    "this was done in obtaining figure  6(b ) from figure  6(a ) : figure  6(a ) shows the maximum lattice variances for negative @xmath41 as a function of @xmath16 for two values of @xmath103 .",
    "the corresponding physical variances are shown in figure  6(b ) .",
    "since the variances are fluctuating significantly ( see , for example , figure  4 ) , both peak and valley values are given .",
    "these curves , too , will be explained in section  [ sec : masslessii ] .",
    "here we simply note that when the lattice variances behave as shown in figures  4 and 5 it is easy to obtain the maximum physical variances : since we must divide by @xmath104 to obtain the latter from the former , the maximum occurs at the time when the slowly varying state sets in .",
    "after that the slow increase can not keep up with the decrease due to the expansion .      the most striking feature of figures  25 is the fact that after an initial period of rapid exponential decay the system reaches a slowly evolving state during which the rate of energy transfer from the inflaton zeromode to the fluctuations is quite small .",
    "this effect has been studied in detail in @xcite , where it is shown that for large @xmath16 or @xmath103 backreaction and scattering limits the maximum amplitudes of the variances and essentially shuts down the resonance . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to the slowly evolving state as the _ scattering regime _ @xcite .",
    "the variances of the physical fields at the time the scattering regime begins are of central interest since they are the maximum variances of the fields reached during preheating .",
    "the reason that the decay of the inflaton shuts off for large @xmath16 or @xmath103 while most of the energy is still in the oscillating zeromode is the backreaction of the created particles on the eom . in particular the effective masses of the fields",
    "get contributions of the form @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "as was explained in the introduction , the instability index @xmath105 is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath106 above the line @xmath107 @xcite ( see also figure  1 ) .",
    "in fact the decay due to the second band above this line is already very slow . now",
    "the backreaction terms add a contribution @xmath108 to @xmath106 , and for large @xmath40 the distance between the first two bands above @xmath109 is about @xmath110 ( _ cf . _",
    "figure  1(b ) ) .",
    "hence when the shift in @xmath106 becomes so large that @xmath111 the first band above @xmath112 is rendered ineffective and the decay slows down dramatically @xcite . from this condition",
    "one can obtain estimates of the variances at the beginning of the slowly varying scattering regime .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the ( lattice ) variances are then kept roughly constant at these maximum values by a feedback mechanism .",
    "it is important to point out that scattering plays a crucial part in the shut off mechanism .",
    "for example , we will see below that when @xmath5 is small the resonance is shut off by the @xmath113 term .",
    "this term grows large due to scattering of resonant @xmath6 particles off the @xmath3 zeromode , an effect that is completely lost in the hartree type approximations often used to study preheating .",
    "the fact that the @xmath3 variance is responsible for shutting off the resonance for small @xmath5 was first realized in @xcite .    before deriving estimates for the variances based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta a ] ) we wish to point out that there is always a substantial `` intrinsic '' uncertainty associated with such estimates . by this",
    "we mean that physical quantities such as maximum variances , energies , _ et cetera _ , are extremely sensitive functions of the parameters in the model .",
    "for example , we have seen above that for large @xmath40 a shift of order @xmath114 is enough to move the initial position of the first resonant momentum above @xmath107 from @xmath115 to @xmath116 . since @xmath105 is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath117 @xcite such a shift can have a substantial effect on the early evolution of the system .",

    "positive and negative coupling ",
    "* cases i * and * ii *  will be treated separately . as explained above",
    ", the maximum physical variances are reached at the beginning of the slowly evolving scattering regime .",
    "since the variances fluctuate we distinguish between peak values and valley values .",
    "estimates obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta a ] ) correspond to peak values since eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta a ] ) is the condition for shutting off the resonance .",
    "this condition must be met during those parts of the period of the inflaton zero mode when the resonance is active , but in between the variances can drop to smaller ( valley ) values .",
    "the formulae below will be given in terms of the quantity @xmath119 , which is the amplitude of oscillations at the time the maximum variances are reached@xcite .",
    "we will discuss how to estimate @xmath120 after deriving the expressions for the variances .",

    "( [ eq : a , q ] ) and ( [ eq : mass and frequency ] ) reveals that both the numerator and the denominator of @xmath40 scale as @xmath122 . hence , while @xmath40 may change significantly due to the decay of the inflaton , it does _ not _ change due to the expansion in the massless case .    * case i. * for @xmath21 , eq .",

    "we should point out that we expect eq .",
    "( [ eq : variance v ] ) to fail for very large @xmath103 ( _ i.e. _ large @xmath5 ) .",
    "the reason is simply that in this case the @xmath6 resonance shuts off for relatively small occupation numbers , so that @xmath165 scatterings should not affect the @xmath3 resonance very much , and hence @xmath161 should reach its one field value .",

    "( [ eq : variance iv ] ) and  ( [ eq : variance v ] ) predict @xmath171 and @xmath172 , so that the agreement is quite good .",
    "we will now address the question how to estimate the quantity @xmath119 in terms of which our expressions for the variances , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : variance ii ] ) , ( [ eq : variance iii ] ) , ( [ eq : variance i ] ) , ( [ eq : variance ib ] ) , ( [ eq : variance iv ] ) , and ( [ eq : variance v ] ) , are given .",
    "recall that @xmath119 is the amplitude of @xmath50 at the time when the scattering regime is reached and the variances peak in the expanding universe .",
    "the first thing to note is that in the _ absence _ of expansion the amplitude of the @xmath3 zeromode does not decrease significantly by the time the scattering regime is reached .",
    "this can be observed in figures  2 and 3 .",
    "the reason is simply that the energy density is proportional to @xmath86 , so that even a substantial loss of energy corresponds to a rather small change in amplitude . to obtain an estimate for @xmath119 we can thus take the decrease to be due to the expansion alone .",
    "then @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the beginning of the scattering regime . as already pointed out at the beginning of this section , @xmath174 depends sensitively on the initial position of the resonance and is consequently difficult to estimate accurately .",
    "since the occupation numbers grow as @xmath175 we find @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the occupation number of the resonant modes at the beginning of the scattering regime .",
    "our initial conditions correspond to `` @xmath178''@xmath179 @xcite , and @xmath180 is roughly @xmath181 for the small @xmath5 , @xmath21 case , and @xmath182 for the large @xmath5 , @xmath21 and @xmath90 cases @xcite .",
    "the difference arises because in the first case @xmath161 is responsible for shutting off the resonance while in the latter two cases the growth of @xmath130 terminates the exponential regime ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this leaves us with the question what value to take for @xmath14 . from figure  1",
    "we see that @xmath183 is reasonable for the positive @xmath41 case , where we are limited to the region above @xmath107 .",
    "this is also correct in the negative @xmath41 case : it is not hard to show that @xmath52 until @xmath184 ( @xcite ) , which is already larger than the positive @xmath41 value given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : variance ib ] ) . as discussed in the introduction , the negative @xmath41 case is equivalent to positive @xmath41 as long as @xmath52 , so during this initial period the positive @xmath41 value for @xmath14 is appropriate .",
    "once @xmath55 stops following @xmath56 the variance rises rapidly to its negative @xmath41 peak , in a time interval negligible compared to the already elapsed time .",
    "hence we can estimate @xmath174 using the positive @xmath41 value for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "for example , for the runs in figures  25 we obtain @xmath185 , in reasonable agreement with the numerical results .",

    "the final task of this section will be to explain the evolution of the variances in more detail . a closer look at figures  4 and  5 reveals a rather complex behavior of the variances .",
    "the first prominent feature is a slow modulation of the maximum @xmath3 variance .",
    "a simple explanation of this phenomenon can be gotten by assuming that the infrared ( ir ) modes oscillate in phase and can be modeled by one oscillator of a definite frequency @xmath187 . for @xmath188",
    "we then have two weakly coupled oscillators , the ir mode and the zero mode , with the same natural frequency .",
    "these modes will transfer energy back and forth much like two pendulums coupled by a spring . as can be seen in figures  3 and  5 ,",
    "the maxima of the variance envelope correspond to minima of the zeromode envelope , and vice versa .",
    "note that no such modulation occurs for the @xmath6 field since no dominant @xmath6 zeromode develops in the scattering regime .",
    "the second prominent feature of the variances is that in the scattering regime they fluctuate between `` peak '' and `` valley '' values with frequency @xmath189 . understanding this behavior is potentially important for applications",
    "were precise values of the variances are required , such as nonthermal phase transitions and baryogenesis .",
    "a first estimate of the amplitude of these fluctuations has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will present an alternative derivation , leading to somewhat different results .",
    "we will attempt to explain the origin of the variance _ fluctuations _ using a simple toy model which contains some generic features of the resonant growth , and also teaches us something about the slowly varying scattering regime .",
    "we will illustrate our model on the @xmath6 field and first treat the case @xmath21 .",
    "after neglecting the nonlinear ( scattering ) terms , the equation of motion for a field mode @xmath190 can be written as @xmath191 where @xmath192 since we are interested in ir modes that contribute significantly to the variance we can neglect the momentum dependence of the frequency .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta a ii ] ) we then find that in the scattering regime @xmath193 varies between @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "dropping @xmath196 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq toy ] ) hence amounts to assuming that the variance is dominated by modes with @xmath197 .",
    "consider now the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy model for x ] ) if @xmath198 for @xmath199 and @xmath200 for @xmath201 : @xmath202 the important feature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution to x ] ) is that for @xmath203 the amplitude of the `` kinetic term '' @xmath204 at @xmath201 is amplified by @xmath205 in comparison to the kinetic term at @xmath199 .",
    "this amplification captures the essence of the amplitude growth mechanism , and it may be used to explain the variance fluctuations in the scattering regime , as follows . consider a sequence of @xmath206 matchings as in eq .",

    "using the fact that @xmath209 we find for @xmath210 small that @xmath211 . since these are the modes that dominate the variance , this translates into @xmath212 .",
    "plugging in the values for the frequencies obtained below eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq toy ] ) yields @xmath213 this estimate agrees well with figure  5 after @xmath214 . before that the oscillations are somewhat larger .",
    "( [ eq : variance growth ] ) also agrees well with the large @xmath40 runs presented in @xcite .    for negative @xmath41",
    "the fluctuations in the variance are of different origin .",
    "for one thing , the peaks in @xmath130 now occur when @xmath50 is _ maximum _ , in contrast to the positive @xmath41 case just discussed . as already pointed out following eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass and frequency ii ] ) , the largest peaks occur when @xmath215 and @xmath50 is large .",
    "the reason for this is simply that when @xmath55 gets out of phase with @xmath216 , the negative @xmath217 contribution to the @xmath6 mass tends to destabilize the system .",
    "to compensate , the positive @xmath218 term must acquire a magnitude @xmath219 , since , as shown in the introduction , this is the value required to stabilize the mode equations . we have argued above that @xmath55 falls out of phase with @xmath216 when @xmath220 @xcite . for example , in figure  2 this occurs at @xmath221 .",
    "figure  4 shows that the largest variance is reached a quarter of an oscillation later , when @xmath50 reaches its maximum . during this first half - period after @xmath55 stops following @xmath56",
    "there is genuine instability , causing the variance to grow . at later times",
    "the ir modes have sufficient amplitude to compensate the negative mass term without growing exponentially : they simply get pulled by @xmath50 and keep the effective mass positive at all times .",
    "when @xmath50 passes through zero the variance returns to its previous `` valley '' value .",
    "we can estimate the ratio of peak to valley variances by again appealing to our toy model of matching oscillatory solutions with different frequencies , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution to x ] ) .",
    "there are , however , significant differences between the case at hand and the positive @xmath41 case discussed earlier",
    ". for negative @xmath41 the maximum frequency of an infrared @xmath6 mode that contributes significantly to the variance occurs when @xmath50 passes through zero and is approximately given by @xmath222 .",
    "this frequency holds only for a small fraction of the oscillation : as soon as @xmath223 the @xmath6 mode gets dragged along with the @xmath3 zeromode and its frequency changes to @xmath224 .",
    "hence there is no continuous change in frequency as in the positive @xmath41 case , and consequently only one matching of solutions _ @xmath225 la _ eq .  ( [ eq : solution to x ] ) .",
    "the single matching gives @xmath226 , where we assumed that after the matching the kinetic term dominates .",
    "this is the case unless @xmath227 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution to x ] ) .",
    "next we use @xmath228 this prediction can be compared to the numerical results presented in figure  6 . as explained previously ,",
    "the maximum lattice variances are much smoother functions of the parameters than the physical variances , and we will thus concentrate on figure  6(a ) .",
    "note that even though we have presented @xmath229 runs in figure  6 , these runs just barely reach the scattering regime , especially for @xmath230 ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) . after discarding",
    "the @xmath231 runs we obtain as a best fit @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : variance iv ] ) and  ( [ eq : peak - valley ii ] ) .",
    "note that the slopes in figure  6(a ) are increasing with @xmath234 , which may indicate that at @xmath235 the variances still have not reached the full scattering regime values",
    ". this could be the explanation of the somewhat low slopes quoted above .",
    "unfortunately we can not test our estimates reliably for @xmath236 since this would require enormous computing resources .",
    "the problem is essentially that as @xmath41 and @xmath5 get large the particles scatter readily into high momentum states and one needs an enormous ultraviolet cutoff in order to accommodate the decayed energy .",
    "this must be combined with good ir resolution in order not to miss scatterings such as @xmath237 which involve very ir momenta .",
    "the upshot is that we have found negative @xmath41 simulations with @xmath238 to be unreliable even on @xmath78 lattices ( in the massless case ) .",

    "we wish to point out that from the outset one might expect the sign of the coupling @xmath41 to play an important role in this context .",
    "the reason is that in the negative @xmath41 case the maximum resonant momenta are of order @xmath257 , which is by a factor @xmath258 larger than in the positive @xmath41 case .",

    "the estimates we obtain in this section will be used in section  [ sec : baryogenesis ] to estimate baryon production . in connection with this",
    "we remark that very massive particles are created only marginally relativistic and quickly become nonrelativistic due to redshifting .",
    "in this situation the variance is simply related to the number density of particles @xmath260 and energy density @xmath241 of the field : @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta a ] ) one can make a quantitative estimate of when the resonance shuts off .",
    "indeed , when @xmath106 becomes larger than about @xmath263 the inflaton decay slows down dramatically , essentially because the instability exponent @xmath14 decreases rapidly above the @xmath107 line ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure  1 ) .",
    "if the increase in @xmath106 is mostly due to the ( tree level ) mass @xmath54 , we say that the resonance is shut off by the @xmath6 mass .",
    "if , on the other hand , the growth of @xmath106 can be attributed mainly to the backreaction effects ( the contribution of the growing variances to the effective mass ) , the situation resembles the massless case in the sense that the variances reach their scattering regime values of section  [ sec : masslessii ] and a slowly varying state sets in . before we begin studying the details of each of the cases mentioned above , we point out that the universe expansion is crucial in shutting off the inflaton decay .",
    "this is so in essence because the inflaton amplitude decreases as the universe expands , while the tree level mass stays constant .",
    "more concretely , the resonance shuts off when the mass becomes greater than the typical physical resonant momentum , which scales as @xmath264 for a massless inflaton and @xmath265 for a massive inflaton .",
    "this means that , as the universe expands , the ( physical ) scale on which particles are produced redshifts and hence the relative importance of the @xmath6 mass increases , leading eventually to the termination of particle production .",
    "once the resonance is shut off , the only energy exchange mechanism that remains active is the perturbative scatterings .",

    "to summarize , the main reason why the massive inflaton is more efficient in producing massive particles is that the typical resonant momenta redshift slower .",

    "the case of inflaton decay into massive @xmath6 particles with a negative cross - coupling @xmath41 is significantly more complex than the positive @xmath41 case .",

    "the growth mechanism is quite different from the positive @xmath41 case , and we will describe its main features below . however , a complete analytical understanding is extremely difficult to achieve .",
    "the reason is the extremely `` chaotic '' nature of the process , which we have already pointed out when describing the figures in section  [ sec : massivei ] .",

    "the difference is that for massive @xmath6 the `` falling out of phase '' can occur without the need for large variances .",

    "the variance grows with an exponent of order @xmath363 .",
    "a quantity which is clearly of interest is the probability that for a given set of parameters a negative coupling instability , and the huge particle production associated with it , occurs . as explained above",

    "one might guess that the _ a priori _ probability for the mode amplitudes to grow by a factor @xmath367 ought to be of order @xmath368 .",

    "the high sensitivity of the growth to small changes in the parameters can be also seen in figure  12 .",
    "note that because of the chaotic nature of the production mechanism one should not take the fact that we have connected our data points in these figures with line segments too seriously - for all but the most closely spaced points there could be numerous peaks and valleys in between .",
    "the probability @xmath393 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : probability i ] ) is essentially the probability _ per inflaton half - period _ that the variance grows by a factor @xmath394 , provided that @xmath395 .",

    "this will be discussed in detail below . here",
    "we want to emphasize that the probability is _ per inflaton half - period _ because a phase mismatch can occur twice per period when the curvature of @xmath364 at the origin changes sign from positive to negative .",

    "since @xmath334 is also slightly larger in the massive case we see that one requires somewhat smaller values of @xmath250 in the massless case .",
    "we will now briefly discuss the ratio of `` peak '' to `` valley '' variances in the scattering regime for massive particles .",
    "this was discussed for massless particles at the end of section  [ sec : masslessii ] , where we found distinctly different behaviors for positive and negative @xmath41 .",

    "the difference is that now @xmath406 , and @xmath407 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the scattering regime is reached when @xmath408 , then the infrared @xmath6 modes can be dragged along by @xmath50 just as in the massless negative @xmath41 case , and hence @xmath409 which reduces to @xmath410 when @xmath411 , and to @xmath412 when @xmath413 .",

    "shows that for negative coupling the massless inflaton is actually somewhat more effective in producing massive particles than the massive inflaton .",
    "this is opposite to the positive coupling situation , although it should be noted that for the present case the difference arises only from a numerical factor ; the parametric dependence is the same .",
    "finally we point out that the maximum possible variance is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : varmax ] ) also for the massive inflaton since eq .",
    "( [ eq : negative g shut off ] ) holds in both cases .",
    "it is well known that grand unified theories generically predict the existence of baryon number ( b ) violating interactions .",
    "much effort has gone into converting this fact into a viable mechanism for baryogenesis @xcite . in the standard scenario ,",
    "b violating gauge or higgs bosons fall out of thermal equilibrium as the temperature of the universe drops below their mass and subsequently decay , creating net b in the process .",
    "this b must then be protected from being wiped out by sphalerons , electroweak b violating processes .",
    "fortunately sphaleron transitions conserve b ",
    "l , where l is lepton number , so that any gut that creates a non vanishing b ",
    "l remains a viable candidate .",
    "examples are @xmath444 and @xmath445 .",
    "according to the old theory of reheating @xcite , based on perturbative decay of the inflaton , gut baryogenesis seems rather difficult to implement @xcite .",
    "the reason is simply that the heavy b violating gauge or higgs bosons can not be produced efficiently .",
    "the gauge bosons are expected to have masses of order the gut scale ( @xmath446gev ) , while the higgs bosons may have masses as low as @xmath447gev .",
    "since the mass of the inflaton @xmath448 can not be larger than about @xmath449gev in order not to be in conflict with the measured anisotropy in the microwave background @xcite , direct perturbative production of gut bosons is kinematically forbidden .",
    "in addition , the weak coupling of the inflaton to other fields causes the reheat temperature , as obtained in perturbation theory , to be so low that thermal production is also ineffective @xcite .    clearly gut baryogenesis after inflation",
    "is resurrected by parametric resonance .",
    "not only can bosons with masses larger than the inflaton be produced directly .",
    "they are automatically far from thermal equilibrium , thus satisfying one of the prerequisites for baryogenesis . the first model following the baryon asymmetry from the end of preheating to the final decay of the inflaton is presented in @xcite .",
    "the authors assume that during the resonance stage a fraction of the initial inflaton energy is rapidly transferred to gut bosons with mass @xmath450 .",
    "these bosons then decay in a cp violating manner , producing net baryon number in the process .    while the results of the toy model in @xcite are very encouraging , it has a rather unpleasant feature . as shown in @xcite as well as sections  [ sec : massiveii.1 ] and  [ sec : massiveii.2 ] ,",
    "for @xmath21 it is quite difficult to produce particles as massive as @xmath450 during preheating .",
    "specifically , production of such particles requires a massive inflaton and @xmath451 . since @xmath452gev this corresponds to @xmath453 , which leads to a fine tunning problem : in order to reproduce the anisotropies in the microwave background the quartic self coupling of the inflaton is constrained to be @xmath454 , which is unnatural because @xmath455 receives contributions of order @xmath456 at the one - loop level .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite this problem does not arise if the value of @xmath455 is protected by a supersymmetric non - renormalization theorem .",
    "however , so far no such model has been constructed , and in any case it is interesting to explore other solutions to the naturalness problem .    in light of these considerations",
    "our investigation of massive particle production in section  [ sec : massive ] is particularly important for baryogenesis .",
    "we have shown that with @xmath90 large amounts of heavy particles are produced even for moderate values of @xmath16 . in particular the naturalness condition @xmath457",
    "is easily satisfied even for @xmath458gev or more . additionally , the production of the heavy particles is extremely rapid , so that it is not affected by competing decay channels .",
    "in fact , as explained in section  [ sec : massiveii ] , for @xmath90 the decay into massive particles is much faster than the decay into light particles provided the mass is such that @xmath55 and @xmath216 quickly fall out of phase .",
    "finally , in contrast to the positive @xmath41 case , with @xmath90 heavy particles are produced by both massive and massless inflaton fields .",
    "for these reasons we feel that negative coupling baryogenesis after preheating is an exciting possibility .    in order to illustrate how this baryogenesis mechanism works we adopt the toy model presented in @xcite , with some minor modifications . before doing so",
    "let us briefly mention two potential problems with the gut baryogenesis scenario in general .",
    "first , there is the possibility that gut symmetry is restored after inflation by a thermal or nonthermal @xcite phase transition . this could lead to the production of cosmologically dangerous topological defects .",
    "fortunately it seems unlikely that either type of phase transition would be strong enough to restore the symmetry , at least for large portions of parameter space @xcite .",
    "the second potential problem with the scenario is that gravitinos are overproduced and spoil nucleosynthesis .",
    "this also does not look like a major obstacle because the late decay of the inflaton has the ability to sufficiently dilute the gravitino abundance produced early on @xcite .",
    "the toy baryogenesis model we will analyze is as follows .",
    "when the production of massive particles shuts off ( @xmath459 ) @xcite , there is a fraction of energy @xmath460 in the gut boson field @xmath6 .",
    "as indicated by our results in section  [ sec : massive ] , we will take @xmath461 .",
    "since the @xmath6 bosons are only moderately relativistic at creation ( @xmath462 ) they quickly become `` cold '' as the universe expands and can be approximated as having zero kinetic energy .",
    "we assume that they decay into light particles with a constant decay rate @xmath463 .",
    "the decay of each @xmath464 pair produces @xmath210 baryons , where @xmath210 should be thought of as an effective cp violating parameter @xcite . in a realistic model @xmath210",

    "we also assume that the decay products thermalize instantly , which is a good approximation if they are strongly coupled .",
    "the decay of what remains of the inflaton field is modeled by a constant rate @xmath465 , and we will assume a hierarchy of time scales @xmath466 where @xmath279 is the initial hubble parameter .",
    "finally , we make one important simplification over the model presented in @xcite : it is assumed that at all times the temperature of the decay products is much smaller than the mass @xmath467 .",
    "this allows us to compute the baryon to entropy ratio @xmath468 analytically .",
    "the precise criterion for the validity of the inequality @xmath469 will be given below .",

    "the mathieu equation is a good starting point since it describes the simplest possible case , namely the linearized mode equations of the second field in a static space - time when the inflaton is massive .",

    "perhaps the most striking difference is that the @xmath6 variance peaks at a significantly larger value  by a factor @xmath585 larger than in the positive @xmath41 case  leading to a much more complete inflaton decay into @xmath6 particles .",
