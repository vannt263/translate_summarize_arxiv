    "observational astronomy stands at the threshold of an era where gravitational wave detectors are a tool which regularly contributes important information to the growing body of astrophysical knowledge",
    ".  @xcite ground based detectors such as the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory  @xcite ( ligo ) and the forthcoming space based detector the laser interferometer space antenna  @xcite ( lisa ) will probe different regimes of the gravitational wave spectrum and observe sources that radiate at different gravitational wavelengths . unlike their cousins , traditional electromagnetic telescopes , gravitational wave detectors are not imaging instruments .",
    "how then does a gravitational wave astronomer take the output from a detector and extract astrophysical information about the emitting sources ?",
    "this paper introduces a hands - on activity in which introductory astronomy students answer this question .",
    "traditional astronomy is often presented through the medium of colorful images taken with large scale telescopes .",
    "in addition to studying images , astronomers learn about astrophysical systems by collecting data at multiple wavelengths , using narrow band spectra , measuring time varying light curves , and so on .",
    "it is often the case that the core physics governing the evolution of these distant systems is deduced from the physical character of the observed electromagnetic radiation , rather than from the imagery that is used to illustrate the science for other audiences .",
    "gravitational wave astronomy is completely analogous to its electromagnetic cousin , with one important distinction : there will be no image data , because gravitational wave detectors are not imaging instruments .",
    "gravitational wave observatories like ligo and lisa return a noisy time series that has encoded within it gravitational wave signals from one or possibly many overlapping sources . to gain information about the systems emitting these gravitational wave signals",
    "requires the use of time series analysis techniques such as fourier transforms , fisher information matrices , and matched filtering .",
    "recently an activity has shown how students can emulate the match filtering process by comparing ideal signals to mocked noisy detector output .",
    "@xcite in this paper , a procedure is described whereby students can analyze a simulated gravitational wave signal and extract the astrophysical parameters which describe the radiating system .",
    "the goal is to introduce students to how gravitational wave astronomers learn about sources of gravitational radiation in a fashion suitable for classroom or laboratory exercises related to this modern and emerging branch of observational astrophysics .",
    "the rest of this article introduces some basic background of gravitational radiation and then describes the activity .",
    "section  [ sec : theory ] outlines the theory connecting the structure of gravitational waves to astrophysical parameters , and section  [ sec : waveforms ] illustrates the characteristic waveforms from a typical binary system .",
    "section  [ sec : procedure ] illustrates a procedure where measurements made from waveform plots , together with the theory of waveform generation , can be used to extract the astrophysical parameters ( orbital period , distance , etc . ) of the system emitting gravitational radiation .",
    "section  [ sec : discussion ] discusses implementations and extensions for this activity in an introductory astronomy course .",
    "the analysis described in the paper has been implemented in an activity format , complete with a keyed solution for the instructor , and is publicly available online .",
    "in electromagnetism radiation is produced by an accelerating charged particle . similarly in general relativity , gravitational radiation is produced by an accelerating mass . to be precise , gravitational waves are produced by a time varying mass quadrupole moment .",
    "the reason for this is straightforward .",
    "@xcite monopole radiation is prevented due to conservation of mass , while dipole radiation does not occur due to the conservation of momentum .",
    "this leaves the quadrupole as the leading order term in the multipole expansion of the radiation field .",
    "a simple and common example of an astrophysical system with a time varying quadrupole moment is a binary star system .    for a circular binary system , where the components are treated as point - like particles , the gravitational waveforms take on the seductively simple form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gravitational waveform ( also referred to as the gravitational wave strain ) , @xmath2 is the time dependent amplitude , and @xmath3 is the gravitational wave phase .",
    "the amplitude @xmath2 can be expressed in terms of the physical parameters characterizing the system , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the speed of light , @xmath7 is the luminosity distance to the binary , and @xmath8 is the gravitational wave period . the quantity @xmath9 is called the chirp mass and appears repeatedly in gravitational wave physics , making it a natural mass scale to work with . the origin for this nomenclature will become evident shortly . the waveform phase @xmath3 is given by a the integral : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the initial phase .    as in electromagnetism ,",
    "gravitational waves have two independent polarization states . for a binary system",
    "the two states are related by a @xmath12 phase shift .",
    "consequently , eq .   captures the functional form for both polarization states . for the purposes of this paper only a single polarization state and its associated waveform",
    "will be discussed .",
    "gravitational waves carry energy and angular momentum away from the binary system causing the orbital period to decrease with time according to  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the orbital period at time @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is an evolution constant given by @xmath17 as a consequence of the ever shortening orbital period , the two binary components will slowly inspiral , eventually colliding and coalescing into a single remnant . under the assumption of point - like particles made here ,",
    "this formally occurs when @xmath18 .",
    "note that eq .   gives the orbital period _ not _ the gravitational wave period .",
    "careful scrutiny of eqs .   and   will reveal that the gravitational wave period @xmath8 is the quantity which appears in the description of the waveform .",
    "fortunately , for circularized binary systems , @xmath19 and @xmath8 are simply related : @xmath20 the simple factor of two stems from the fact that the lowest possible order for gravitational radiation production is the quadrupole order .",
    "moreover , quadrupole moments are invariant under a @xmath21 rotation , yielding a factor of two per complete orbit .",
    "as an illustrative example of the kind of waveforms we expect from binaries , consider a binary neutron star system with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) located at the center of the galaxy @xmath24  kpc away .",
    "for the activity we will consider waveforms generated at two distinct times in the binary s evolution .",
    "the first waveform we will consider is @xmath25 years before coalescence . during this phase the gravitational wave frequency is in the regime that will be detectable by the spaceborne lisa observatory , which has a principle sensitivity in the range of @xmath26  hz to 1  hz . the second waveform considered will be during the final second before the neutron star binary coalesces .",
    "the gravitational wave frequencies during this phase are in the regime that will be detectable by the terrestrial ligo observatory , which is sensitive to gravitational wave frequencies between 10  hz and @xmath27  hz .",
    "figure  [ fig : mono_signal ] shows the emitted gravitational radiation long before the binary components coalesce . during this era of the binary evolution ,",
    "the gravitational waves are essentially monochromatic ; the orbital period is evolving too slowly to detect a frequency derivative term .        for monochromatic signals like this ,",
    "the only measurable properties of the gravitational waveform are the period @xmath28 ( and the orbital period @xmath29 through eq .  ) , amplitude @xmath30 , and initial phase @xmath11 . even though the waveform equations depend on the chirp mass @xmath31 and the luminosity distance @xmath7 , it is not possible to solve for their values from the data provided by the monochromatic waveform .",
    "not enough information exists to completely solve eqs .   and together for both quantities .",
    "this can be seen by considering the relative size of the two terms in eq .  ; using the binary neutron star chirp mass @xmath32 , it should be evident that the second term is completely negligible compared to the period @xmath14 of the wave shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mono_signal ] . in the parlance of gravitational wave astronomy ,",
    "there is a _ mass - distance degeneracy _ in the waveform description , analogous to the familiar mass - inclination degeneracy in the electromagnetic observations of spectroscopic binaries .",
    "this degeneracy is a well known problem , but as the next section shows , it can be broken if the orbital period of the binary evolves during the gravitational wave observations .      inspection of eq .",
    "shows that as time goes on , the emission of gravitational waves causes the orbital period to grow shorter , and as a result the frequency of the emitted waves increases .",
    "similarly , consideration of eq .",
    "shows that as the wave period decreases , the time dependent amplitude @xmath2 increases .",
    "this is characteristic behavior for gravitational waves emitted just prior to a source coalescence , and is known as a _",
    "chirp_. the chirp waveform emitted by the example binary neutron star system just prior to coalescence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : full_coal ] .        any binary signal which evolves appreciably during the gravitational wave observation",
    "is called a chirping binary . in these cases , the mass parameter @xmath31 which appears in the amplitude @xmath2 and in the period evolution",
    "constant @xmath16 can be determined from measurements of the evolving signal .",
    "for this reason , the mass @xmath31 is called the _ chirp mass_. to leading order in gravitational wave production , it is not possible to measure the individual masses , only the chirp mass .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to distinguish between binaries with the same chirp mass .",
    "for example , the binary neutron star considered in this paper with @xmath33 has roughly the same chirp mass as a binary with an @xmath34 black hole and a @xmath35 white dwarf .    to extract the chirp mass from measurements of the gravitational waveform , consider two small stretches of the chirping waveform .",
    "figure  [ fig : coal_1 ] shows the waveform from @xmath36 , and fig .  [ fig : coal_2 ] shows the waveform from @xmath37 .",
    "the waveform is appreciably different between these two snapshots , both in amplitude @xmath2 and in period @xmath8 .",
    "this allows the degeneracy found in the monochromatic signal case to be broken , because the gravitational wave period can be measured at two different times and used in eq .   to solve for the chirp mass @xmath31",
    "this section illustrates a procedure at the introductory astronomy level where students can make direct measurements from the figures in section  [ sec : waveforms ] using a straight edge and the axis labels . using their measured data together with the theory presented in section  [ sec : theory ] ,",
    "the astrophysical character of the system emitting the gravitational waveforms can be deduced .",
    "limited astrophysical information can be extracted directly from fig .",
    "[ fig : mono_signal ] , as will be the case with true monochromatic signals detected by gravitational wave observatories . with limited assumptions more detailed information can be deduced , which will be valid so long as the assumptions are valid .",
    "a suitable extraction and analysis procedure for an introductory astronomy student would proceed in the following manner :    * the gravitational wave period @xmath28 can be measured directly from the figure .",
    "since the signal is monochromatic , the binary is circular and the orbital period @xmath29 is obtained directly from @xmath28 using eq .  .",
    "for the waveform in fig .",
    "[ fig : mono_signal ] careful measurement should yield a value of @xmath38  sec . *",
    "the amplitude @xmath30 and the initial phase @xmath11 can also be measured directly from the figure . as noted in section  [ sub : far ]",
    "no astrophysical information can be extracted from the amplitude alone .",
    "the initial phase is a simple quantity to measure , but does not represent any intrinsic property of the binary ; its value is solely a consequence of when the gravitational wave observations began . to illustrate this ,",
    "imagine relabeling the time axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : mono_signal ] to represent a new observation which started somewhat later than the observation shown .",
    "the initial phase will have some new value , but the waveform itself does not change because the intrinsic properties of the binary did not change .",
    "* if a gravitational wave astronomer were to assume that the binary was a pair of neutron stars , the component mass values could be assigned as part of the assumption .",
    "most neutron star masses cluster around @xmath39 , so a good base assumption is that each component of the binary has this mass . as noted in section  [ sub : far ] this assumption can be a dangerous one , since similar chirp masses @xmath31 can result from significantly different systems . other information , not present in the gravitational waveform , may help an astronomer feel more confident about such an assumption .",
    "for example , an associated simultaneous electromagnetic signal or the location of the source on the sky may favor one model of the binary over another .",
    "* if the masses are assumed , the orbital separation of the binary components , @xmath40 , can be computed from the measured orbital period by using kepler s third law : @xmath41 for this example , the orbital separation is @xmath42 , or a little less than the separation of the earth and the moon . *",
    "if the masses are assumed , the distance to the binary can be computed from eq .   and the measured amplitude .",
    "if careful measurements have been made , the answer should be close to the value @xmath43 .",
    "lastly , if the masses are assumed , it can be quantitatively shown that the monochromatic descriptor is a good one for this wave by computing the value of the second term in eq .   and showing that it is negligible compared to the measured period @xmath14 .      in the case of a chirping waveform ,",
    "additional astrophysical information associated with the system can be extracted directly from measurements of the waveform without making underlying assumptions like those needed when the system was far from coalescence . to extract information from the chirping waveform shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : full_coal ] , the two zoom - ins of the waveform shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : coal_1 ] and [ fig : coal_2 ] will be used .",
    "a typical extraction procedure might look like this :    * for each of the figs .",
    "[ fig : coal_1 ] and [ fig : coal_2 ] , measure the period of one cycle of the wave , and note the time @xmath44 at which the periods were measured .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath2 should be measured for the same cycle as the periods . * if the period measured at time @xmath45 in fig .",
    "[ fig : coal_1 ] is @xmath14 , and the period measured at time @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : coal_2 ] is @xmath8 at time @xmath47 , then eq .   can be used to deduce the chirp mass @xmath31 of the system .",
    "* once the chirp mass @xmath31 has been determined , the distance to the binary can be computed by using eq .   with the measured amplitude @xmath2 and period @xmath8 of each waveform .",
    "the results from the two figures can be averaged together to obtain a final result .",
    "this paper introduced the core calculations in gravitational wave astrophysics an introductory astronomy student can perform in a laboratory setting to glean information about an astrophysical system . to compliment this article we have also developed a student activity sheet and corresponding teacher s guide related to the exercises described in sections  [ sub : monochromatic ] and [ sub : chirping ] .",
    "the complimentary material is available , along with a template activity ,  @xcite at ` http://cgwp.gravity.psu.edu/outreach/activities/ ` .",
    "the activity described here is a simple introduction to how gravitational wave astronomers extract astrophysical information from observed binary waveforms .",
    "real signal analysis is a more complex endeavor than what has been presented here .",
    "the most significant challenge in the case of true data is identifying the signal buried in a noisy data stream .",
    "a common approach to this problem in gravitational wave astronomy is to use template matching , which has been explored in a separate activity .",
    "@xcite if a signal is present in a noisy data stream , the template provides a way to subtract the noise away and leave a clean waveform behind .",
    "this is the assumed starting point in the activity developed here .",
