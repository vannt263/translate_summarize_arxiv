    "the combination of low dimensionality and strong correlations proved fruitful in the quest for new materials with functional - oriented properties .",
    "it lead to the high-@xmath6 superconductivity,@xcite transparent conducting oxides,@xcite high capacitance heterostructures,@xcite and large thermopower,@xcite to quote a few .",
    "recently , the creation of high - mobility electron gases with reduced dimensionality has also been pursued in artificially layered oxide systems .",
    "they include ( i ) the interface between the two insulators @xmath7 and @xmath8,@xcite ( ii ) systems with ultra - thin doping layers as @xmath9 in @xmath7,@xcite and ro layers with r = la , pr , nd in @xmath7,@xcite and ( iii ) the surface of @xmath7.@xcite in some of these systems functional properties were found , such as superconductivity@xcite and ferromagnetism.@xcite    charge carriers with reduced dimensionality can be introduced in other complex oxides , too .",
    "for instance , ultra - thin @xmath10 layers can be intercalated in @xmath11,@xcite resulting in ferromagnetism up to room temperature@xcite although none of the two oxides is magnetic at this temperature .",
    "this points out the relevance of the layered geometry , since the solid solution la@xmath12sr@xmath13vo@xmath0 shows the typical phase diagram of a doped mott - insulator with a transition from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a non - magnetic metal at about @xmath14.@xcite contrary to the solid solution , ( lavo@xmath0)@xmath1/srvo@xmath0 superlattices show ferromagnetic behavior above room temperature for @xmath4 ranging from 3 to 6 , with a higher magnetization for even @xmath4 values than for odd values . thus , the geometrically confined doping in the superlattices gives rise to a magnetic phase which is not observed in the randomly doped solid solution .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the reduced dimension of electronic states confined in a potential created by the interface of two insulators , or by geometrically confined doping , leads to a renewed interest in two - dimensional systems .",
    "studies of the three band hubbard model predict a ferromagnetic ground state in case of 2/3 and 3/4 band filling for a reduced bandwidth due to the enhanced correlations of the electrons.@xcite ferromagnetism was also theoretically predicted for a model specific to two t@xmath15 orbitals,@xcite at srtio@xmath0/lavo@xmath0 interfaces@xcite and in srtio@xmath0/srvo@xmath0 superlattices,@xcite indicating a strong coupling of the electronic , magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom to the geometry of the superlattice including the number of srvo@xmath0 layers .",
    "again , in both cases the magnetic phase was largely explained by the confinement and a change in the orbital occupations .",
    "however , in the case of superlattices or heterostructures , the reduced bandwidth and therefore enhanced correlations are just one part of the story . as in those systems two different materials",
    "are epitaxially grown on top of each other , also the misfit of the lattice parameters of both materials plays a role for the properties of the system mediated by the distortion of the structure due to strain . especially in oxides the distortion can have a strong influence on the properties since , as mentioned above , the electronic , spin and lattice degrees of freedom are strongly coupled .",
    "this effect was shown theoretically in distorted lavo@xmath0 where , depending on the distortion of the lattice , different antiferromagnetic structures become energetically favorable.@xcite    in order to analyze the ferromagnetic state observed in ( lavo@xmath0)@xmath1/srvo@xmath0 superlattices , electronic band structure calculations are helpful to confirm the confinement of the electronic states and to elucidate the origin of the ferromagnetism .",
    "for this purpose , we will use density functional theory and address the distortion of the lattice .",
    "furthermore , the superlattices show an asymmetry of the magnetic properties between odd and even numbers of lavo@xmath0 unit cells .",
    "thus , one aim of the calculations is to provide evidences for a possible difference in confinement between the two geometries .",

    "sec : concl ] .",
    "there are many systems for which there is a consensus about the appropriate density functional .",
    "this is not the case for the vanadates and we therefore start our considerations addressing this point .",
    "the rare earth vanadates with perovskite structure , including lavo@xmath0 , have the v ion in a @xmath17 valence state , i.e. , the two electrons in the v @xmath18 shell occupy two of the @xmath19 orbitals with @xmath20 .",
    "the crystal field splitting of the @xmath18 orbitals in threefold degenerate @xmath19 and twofold degenerate @xmath21 orbitals is a consequence of the octahedral coordination of the v ions by o atoms .",
    "the rare earth vanadates show simultaneous antiferro - type spin and orbital ordering.@xcite the spin ordering of lavo@xmath0 is c - type , i.e. , the alignment is antiferromagnetic within the @xmath22-plane and ferromagnetic along the @xmath23-direction.@xcite the accompanying orbital order is g - type , i.e. , it alternates in all directions . other vanadates show g - type spin ordering together with c - type orbital ordering . for an overview of the phase diagram see ref .  .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "that strain due to the coherent growth on a substrate can strongly affect the orbital ordering .",
    "for an increasing @xmath24 ratio the g - type order is destabilized .",
    "it is essential that the approximation to the density functional treats the lattice , magnetic , and electronic properties on an equal level . while the local density approximation ( lda ) typically underestimates the bond lengths and magnetic couplings , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) overestimates both . for bulk",
    "lavo@xmath0 , the gga correctly predicts the c - type spin ordering , while the lda tends to delocalize the electronic states , which is critical in the case of narrow @xmath18 bands . to obtain an insulating state , corrections beyond the lda / gga have to be considered , such as the lda / gga+@xmath25 approach in which a local interaction is added for the @xmath18 orbitals .",
    "@xcite this enhances the separation of the @xmath18 energy levels and opens a band gap .",
    "it is found that the magnetic ordering can be changed by this treatment.@xcite    a further step towards a rigorous treatment can be achieved by hybrid functionals which incorporate a non - local fock exchange .",
    "hybrid functionals such as pbe0 and hse yield an electronic structure comparable to self - consistent gw calculations for much lower computational cost . even the local eece approach has shown clear advantages over the lda / gga+@xmath25 in describing the electronic structure in nickelate stripe phases.@xcite however , it is known that the fock term ( without correction of the correlation term ) results in a substantial overestimation of the magnetic coupling and , therefore , in an unreliable determination of the magnetic ordering , including phase transitions .",
    "a gw treatment leads to accurate electronic structures and magnetic phase transitions but is computationally too costly for superlattice systems .",
    "the best compromise therefore is the lda / gga+@xmath25 approach , which we apply in the following .",
    "specifically , we employ the wien2k augmented plane wave plus local orbitals code.@xcite we find that the energies and electronic states obtained for the fully localized and around mean field double counting corrections show the same behavior .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath25 is adjusted as follows . for @xmath26",
    "ev the c - type spin ordering is energetically favored over the g - type ordering .",
    "a band gap of 1.5 ev is obtained for @xmath27 ev in the case of c - type spin ordering , while the same gap is found in the case of g - type spin ordering for @xmath28 ev , see fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , the c - type orbital ordering under g - type spin ordering depends only weakly on @xmath25 and on the lattice strain . on the other hand , the g - type orbital",
    "ordering under c - type spin ordering is very sensitive to strain .",
    "disorder or ferro - type orbital ordering is found for @xmath29 ( which is fulfilled in our superlattice system ) .",
    "ferromagnetism and a - type antiferromagnetism result in higher energies than the c- and g - type spin orderings for all approximations under study .",
    "electronic densities of states for c - type and g - type spin ordered lavo@xmath0 for @xmath30 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "while the g - type density of states ( dos ) indicates very narrow bands , the bands are much broader for c - type spin ordering despite the higher @xmath25 value . for c - type spin ordering , the @xmath31 orbital , forming a double peak , is occupied , while the @xmath32 orbitals are partially occupied and therefore subject to orbital ordering , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "in contrast , for g - type spin ordering , the @xmath33 orbital is occupied , with a much less pronounced dos structure , and the orbital ordering affects the @xmath34 orbitals .    within gga",
    "the ground state of bulk srvo@xmath0 is antiferromagnetic with @xmath35 @xmath36 , but the energy difference to the non - magnetic solution is small , amounting to 0.2 mev per v atom.@xcite for the gga+@xmath25 method , the c - type antiferromagnet is favored by 30 mev per v atom over the a - type antiferromagnet and by 140 mev per v atom over the ferromagnet .",
    "a local hybrid approach with 25% fock mixing would favor g - type spin ordering , since a c - type starting configuration changes to g - type during the self - consistency calculation .",
    "the onsite interaction does not open a band gap in bulk srvo@xmath0 but the compound stays metallic . around the fermi energy ,",
    "we find the @xmath19 orbitals equally partially occupied , while the @xmath21 orbitals are empty .",
    "even though the spin - orbit coupling has little impact on the ground state of lavo@xmath0 it must be included in the case of srvo@xmath0.@xcite indeed it splits the @xmath19 states and gives rise to a band gap of 0.61 ev . in this case",
    "c - type spin ordering ( magnetization in the @xmath37-direction ) comes along with filled @xmath33 and half - filled @xmath38 orbitals , yielding ferro - type orbital ordering .",

    "the structure setup for the calculations of the superlattice starts from the tetragonal phase of lavo@xmath0 , neglecting an orthorhombic lowering of the symmetry due to rotations of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "in addition , ideal atomically sharp interfaces are studied .",
    "we put one srvo@xmath0 layer between @xmath3 or @xmath16 lavo@xmath0 layers , representative of the odd and even superlattices , respectively .",

    "six vo@xmath5 layers lie in between the sro layers and the lao forms the inversion layer , while in the even superlattice with its seven vo@xmath5 layers , the central vo@xmath5 layer is the inversion layer ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .    in a first step ,",
    "we neglect the antiferromagnetic order in the @xmath43-plane and restrict ourselves to a @xmath44 supercell in the @xmath43-plane . in @xmath45-direction ,",
    "ferromagnetic alignment is proposed , as expected for c - type spin order .",
    "it turns out in a second step that when taking into account also the magnetic ordering in the @xmath43-plane by a @xmath46 supercell the results concerning the interface electronic structure do not depend on the ordering in the @xmath43-plane .",
    "let us start our investigations with the @xmath16 superlattice and first focus on the orbital occupancy reconstruction at the interface .",
    "deep in the lavo@xmath0 region a v@xmath47 valency is realized , with the @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals occupied and the v @xmath50 orbitals empty , as revealed by fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . on the contrary , for the interface layers ( the two vo@xmath5 layers adjacent to the sro layer ) the v @xmath50 orbital is occupied and the v @xmath51 orbitals are partially occupied , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , together with a small admixture of the @xmath21 orbitals .",
    "this results in a smaller valency of the v ions , which shows that they mostly retain the oxidation state of the respective bulk material .",
    "this provides us with a first indication that the doping of lavo@xmath0 is geometrically confined .",
    "superlattice with non - magnetic interfaces .",
    "the interface v @xmath48+@xmath49 orbitals are highlighted.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    this statement is further confirmed by the band structure shown in fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "it exhibits four interface - based bands crossing the fermi energy , two of them giving rise to fairly symmetrical fermi surfaces ( in the @xmath52-plane ) centered around the @xmath53 point .",
    "these bands are characterized by rather large fermi velocities .",
    "in addition , small hole pockets centered around the m - point are found .",
    "they are characterized by clearly smaller fermi velocities and are due to bulk states .",
    "therefore , the fast charge carriers are mostly confined to the interface layers , though in states also containing a small admixture from the sub - interface layer .",
    "additional features of the band structure point to an interesting two - dimensional character of the bands crossing the fermi energy . principally constituted by d@xmath54 ( d@xmath55 ) orbitals which disperse along the @xmath53-x ( @xmath53-y ) direction ,",
    "they unexpectedly show considerable dispersion along x - m ( y - m ) , pointing to an admixture of other orbitals to the d@xmath54 ( d@xmath55 ) orbitals .",
    "also , the dispersion around the @xmath53 point is rather flat and not cosine - like as one would be expected for pure d@xmath54/d@xmath55 bands .",
    "a partial occupation of the d@xmath54 and d@xmath55 orbitals establishes the prerequisite of an orbitally ordered state .",
    "however , this is neither observed in our calculations nor in the experiments , where it was shown that these systems resemble rather good metals at low temperature.@xcite an explanation for this behavior may be found in the observed structure relaxations , where the most important ones are summarized in table [ tab:1 ] . in the interface layers",
    "the v ( o ) ions move towards ( off ) the sro layers , resulting in a sizeable buckling of the interface layers with an amplitude close to 0.11  .",
    "the first lao layers move quite homogeneously towards the sro layer , with a buckling amplitude smaller than 0.01  , while the buckling amplitude of the sub - interface vo@xmath5 layer is close to 0.04  .",
    ".1 cm    lcccc & & & & & & interface layer & @xmath56 & 0.096 & @xmath57 & 0.076 + middle / sub - interface layer & @xmath58 & 0.0029 & @xmath59 & 0.0159 +    [ tab:1 ]    as a result , the bond lengths are strongly reduced between the v ions in the interface vo@xmath5 layers and the o ions in the sro layer , becoming smaller than @xmath60 , i.e. , the distance of the v ion to the o ions in the @xmath22-plane of the sample positioned at @xmath60 is larger than that to the o ion in the @xmath23-direction .",
    "consequently , the non - degenerate v energy level @xmath61 lies below the @xmath62 levels in the interface layer , leading to an enhancement of the dispersion in those layers . on the other hand",
    ", the enlarged bond length between the interface layer and the adjacent lao layer suppresses the orbital overlap in the @xmath23-direction and favors therefore an electronic decoupling of the interface vo@xmath5 layer with respect to the other vo@xmath5 layers , as shown in figure  [ bond ] .",
    "the same tendency of the buckling can still be seen in the sub - interface layer , but with a much smaller amplitude .",
    "the o - v bond length in this case is near to @xmath45/2 as for the other vo@xmath5 layers .",
    "thus , the larger distance between the v ions and the surrounding o atoms is to be found along the @xmath23-direction , inducing the bulk orbital occupancy and , hence , an orbitally ordered insulating state like in the bulk .",
    "thus , the calculated band structure accounts for a two - dimensional metallic state , but it can not account for the experimentally observed ferromagnetism . in a stoner picture",
    "this would be understood as the result of a rather small dos at the fermi energy .",
    "therefore , should this system be ferromagnetic then ferromagnetism would likely be caused by further correlation effects , as taken into account in calculations of multi - orbital hubbard models.@xcite moreover , we have verified that the above electronic structure is stable against the employed @xmath25 value and lattice relaxation , as is the establishment of an ultrathin two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "-direction for @xmath3 ( top ) and @xmath16 ( bottom ) .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates @xmath60.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the @xmath3 superlattice hosts different physics .",
    "again , lattice relaxation plays an important role .",
    "the obtained buckling of the interface layers is summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the interface vo@xmath5 layer shows a buckling with the same displacement directions as for @xmath16 ( the v ions move towards the sro layer and the o ions towards the lao layer ) but the amplitude is smaller .",
    "notably , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bond ] , while for the @xmath63 case the distance between the v ion in the interface layer and the o ion in the sro layer becomes smaller than @xmath64/2 , inducing the inversion of the orbital occupancy , in the @xmath65 case the bond lengths stay larger than @xmath64/2 in all the vo@xmath5 layers .",
    "the smaller amplitude of the buckling therefore does not induce an inversion of the orbital occupation and the confinement of the charge carriers is clearly less effective than in the even case .",
    "furthermore , the reduction of the bond lengths reaches further into the lavo@xmath0 layer , where the bond length of the v ion with the second lao layer counted from the sro layer is still strongly reduced . in comparison , in the @xmath63 case",
    "the same bond length is larger than @xmath45/2 .",
    "the change of the structural relaxation is visible in the resulting layer - projected densities of states in fig .",
    "they consist of the spin - majority density of states , as no sizeable contribution from the spin - minority bands is obtained .",
    "all layers are clearly off stoichiometry and all v ions are in a mixed valency state , yet closer to the 3 + valency in the bulk layers than in the interface layers .",
    "moreover , all v @xmath18 electrons occupy the @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals , while all @xmath50 orbitals are empty , in contrast to the @xmath16 superlattice .",
    "the labeling of the layers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the band structure of the @xmath3 superlattice is shown in fig .",
    "as there are no spin - minority bands close to the fermi level , only spin - majority bands are shown .",
    "there are two narrow bands formed by the interface v @xmath51 orbitals around the fermi level .",
    "the four next lower lying bands are due to the middle and bulk layers with a larger band width .",
    "the bands at the fermi level are separated by a band gap of about 1 ev ( measured at the @xmath53 point ) from the parabolic bands of the bulk states . in addition , the bands with the largest fermi velocities mostly trace back to the middle layer v @xmath51 orbitals , with some admixtures of the bulk and interface layers .",
    "therefore , transport is no longer confined to the interface layers but there is a distinct modulation associated to it .",
    "there are fast charge carriers mostly confined to the next - to - interface layer , with a small admixture of their two neighbors , and slow charge carriers mostly confined to the interface layer .",
    "superlattice with ferromagnetically polarized interfaces .",
    "the interface v @xmath48+@xmath49 orbitals are highlighted.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    narrow @xmath66 bands with high dos at the fermi level often explain ferromagnetism in the @xmath18 transition metal oxides . here",
    "the high dos follows from the slow charge carriers that are confined to the interface layers .",
    "we therefore have performed calculations for @xmath46 supercells in the @xmath43-plane and find that the ground state shows a ferromagnetic alignment of the spins within the interface layer , whereas they are aligned antiferromagnetically in the other layers .",
    "our calculations show that the doping resulting from the charge carriers donated by the sro layers in ( lavo@xmath0)@xmath1/srvo@xmath0 superlattices leads to rich physics built on fast and slow charge carriers together with lattice relaxation . for both types of superlattices",
    "the lattice relaxation plays an important role , demonstrated by the obtained buckling of the vo@xmath5 interface layers and alternation of short and long v - o bond lengths along the @xmath45-axis .",
    "although the buckling of the interface vo@xmath5 layers is qualitatively the same in the two studied cases , the critical difference in the amplitude leads to two different band structures . in the odd @xmath65 case , slow charge carriers",
    "are mostly confined to the interface layers in which they order ferromagnetically .",
    "the confinement of the fast charge carriers is less effective and their distribution peaks in the middle layers . for even superlattices the relaxation confines the fast charge carriers to largely decoupled interface layers in which they form an ultrathin two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "no magnetic order is found and the distribution of slow charge carriers peaks in the sub - interface layers .",
    "therefore , coming back to our original question , it seems unlikely that the geometric confinement of the charge carriers alone is the origin of the experimentally observed ferromagnetic state .",
    "instead , the fact that the even and odd superlattices show a different behavior points out the relevance of the number of unit cells of the lavo@xmath0 layers .    in our calculations we did not take into account the orthorhombic structure of lavo@xmath0,@xcite generated by the octahedral tilts which were shown to be present in pure lavo@xmath0 thin films as well.@xcite the related unit cell is larger than the tetragonal cell used in the calculations , in particular along the tetragonal @xmath45-axis , where the out of phase rotation of the octahedra leads to a doubling of the unit cell , see fig .",
    "therefore , in an even superlattice it is possible to establish the bulk structure including the octahedral rotations in the lavo@xmath0 layer . on the other hand , in the odd superlattice the thickness of the lavo@xmath0 layer corresponds to a half - integer number of the orthorhombic unit cell , so that the bulk structure ( and therefore the bulk physics ) of the lavo@xmath0 layer can not be established .",
    "the compensation by the structure of the lack of the energetically favorable out of phase rotation may lead to the small but critical differences of the lattice relaxations and therefore the orbital occupations between the even and odd case .",
    "the combination of the individual reactions of the structural , orbital , and electronic degrees of freedom leads in the end to a ferromagnetic ground state in the odd superlattices .",
    "our calculations confirm therefore the experimentally observed magnetization oscillations,@xcite although in the experiment the even superlattices were found to show a higher magnetization than the odd ones .",
    "this difference can be explained by the fact that the thickness of the lavo@xmath0 in the experimental study is a nominal one , where the announced thickness does not take into account any intermixing of la and sr during the growth .",
    "it was shown that the interface between the lavo@xmath0 and srvo@xmath0 layers is abrupt but exhibits steps of typically one perovskite unit cell.@xcite the steps lead to the presence of sr atoms in the first lao layer next to the sro layer .",
    "taking into account the growth direction , it can be argued that the thickness of the pure lavo@xmath0 layer will thus be one unit cell less than the nominal one , resulting in an inversion of the nominally odd and nominally even superlattices .    in conclusion ,",
    "two scenarios for the even and odd superlattice have been found . in both cases , the @xmath31 and @xmath67 orbitals form bands crossing the fermi level . in the even superlattice , the orbital occupancy changes from the interface to the bulk layers , while we find an homogeneous orbital occupation in the odd superlattice .",
    "the room temperature magnetism is related to the incomplete formation of the orthorhombic unit cell of lavo@xmath0 in odd superlattices .",
    "a next step could be a comparison of theoretical and experimental macroscopic transport properties of the confined fast charge carriers .",
