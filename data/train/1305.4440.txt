    "let us now briefly look into yamamoto _",
    "s coherent computing model @xcite which is schematically depicted as fig .  [ figlasernetwork ] .",
    "it has one master laser whose output is split into @xmath10 paths and injected to @xmath10 slave lasers .",
    "each slave laser is initially locked to the superposed state @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the right and left circular polarized states ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite for physics of the injection - locked laser system ) .",
    "the initial state of the @xmath10 slave lasers is therefore @xmath35 .",
    "the laser network is a macroscopic system ; thus initially it holds many photons in this same state .",
    "the computational basis is set to @xmath36 and @xmath37 is written as @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath8th slave laser and the @xmath39th slave laser are connected for nonzero @xmath18 . at time",
    "@xmath40 , they mutually inject a small amount of horizontally polarized signal via an attenuator , a phase shifter , and a horizontal linear polarizer , which determine the amplitude attenuation coefficient that is regarded as @xmath18 . among the three instruments ,",
    "the attenuator s transmission coefficient controls @xmath41 and the other instruments controls @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , a small amount of injection of horizontally polarized signal is also made from the master laser to each slave laser at @xmath40 .",
    "this amount corresponds to @xmath13 for the @xmath8th slave laser .",
    "it is controlled by the combination of a half - wave plate and a quarter wave plate . for more details of implementation of the coefficients ,",
    "see section 7 of utsunomiya _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "then one waits for a small time duration @xmath43 to let the system evolve .",
    "laser modes satisfying the matching condition with the above - mentioned setting grow rapidly and other modes are suppressed . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the system is thought to be in a steady state .",
    "then for each slave laser its output is guided to a polarization beam splitter and the right and the left polarization components are separately detected by photodetectors . by a majority vote of photon number",
    "counting , the computational result of each slave laser , @xmath45 , is retrieved .",
    "the steady state @xmath46 is thus determined .",
    "once this is determined , it takes only polynomial time to calculate the corresponding eigenvalue since there are only @xmath11 terms in the hamiltonian ( here , we do not use its matrix form ) .",
    "thus , in short , the state starts from @xmath47 and eventually reaches a steady state representing a configuration that corresponds to the minimum energy of the given hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite employed rate equations involving several factors characterizing each oscillator and connections with other oscillators to analyze photon numbers of the right and left polarization components for each slave laser ; they concluded that the system reaches a steady state within 10 nano seconds without obvious dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "it has been unknown so far if the coherent computing model is a valid computer model in view of a rigid and fair description of computational costs .",
    "conventional analog computing models do not solve np - hard problems within a polynomial cost ; they require either exponentially long convergence time or exponentially fine accuracy @xcite .",
    "thus it should be natural to be skeptical against the power of the coherent computing model . in this contribution",
    ", we investigate the signal per noise ratio in the output of the coherent computer when the npc ising spin configuration problem is handled .",
    "we will reach the fact that for certain hard instances , the relative signal intensity corresponding to solutions is bounded above by a function decreasing exponentially in @xmath10 .",
    "this is because the number of modes that are possibly locked in the laser network increases rapidly in @xmath10 owing to the fact that the locking range of the laser network does not shrink as @xmath10 grows considering imperfectness of optical instruments .",

    "@xcite on the basis of the assumption that given coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath48 are exactly implemented by optical instruments although fluctuations and quantum noise in the system were considered in their analyses of time evolutions using rate equations , which led to a quite ideal convergence taking only 10 nano seconds .    here",

    "_ made numerical simulations @xcite to examine their prospect that a desired configuration would be found efficiently in the coherent computing model .",
    "but , in general , the following points should be taken into account whenever a computer simulation of a physical system is performed .",
    "first , in classical computing , exponentially fine accuracy is achievable by linearly increasing the register size of a variable or an array size of combined variables .",
    "nevertheless , in physical systems , noise decreases as @xmath126 with @xmath127 the number of trials or the number of identical systems according to the well - known central limit theorem . in the field of quantum computing , this has been well - studied in the context of nmr bulk - ensemble computation at room temperature which suffers from exponential decrease of signal intensity corresponding to the computation result as the input size grows ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in the coherent computing model , the ratio of the population of correct configurations and that of wrong configurations at the steady state should not decrease in a super - polynomial manner if the model were physically feasible for solving the problem efficiently .",
    "so far , yamamoto _ et al .",

    ", nonzero @xmath18 s and nonzero @xmath13 s in the ising spin glass hamiltonian should accompany calibration errors and/or thermal fluctuations .",
    "in particular , optical instruments usually have nonnegligible calibration errors @xcite .",
    "as we have written in the proof of proposition  [ prop1 ] , a well - known application of the central limit theorem for the sum of random variables @xcite indicates the important observation that the sum of such physical deviations is an increasing function of the number of spins .",

    "the second point is also usually overlooked in computer simulations @xcite of adiabatic quantum computing .",

    "the coefficients in the starting and the final hamiltonians are quite often considered to be given accurate numbers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , they should have certain errors due to imperfect calibrations @xcite and/or fluctuations in reality , as we have discussed .",
    "the target state will not appear as a stable state if a nontarget state of the final hamiltonian becomes a ground state of the hamiltonian owing to the errors .",

    "so far , @xmath10 has not been very large in physical implementations @xcite so that this problem has not been significant .",

    "there have been several studies on error correction codes @xcite and dynamical decoupling @xcite in the context of adiabatic quantum computing .",
    "it is of interest if similar schemes apply to the coherent computing model . as for error correction codes , each pauli operator in an original hamiltonian should be encoded to a certain multi - partite coupling term in an encoded hamiltonian .",

    "it is highly nontrivial to introduce , _",

    "( 52 ) of ref .",
    "one problem is how to use this scheme for cancelling calibration errors .",
    "in addition , we need to find an implementation of the scheme such that the scheme itself does not introduce an uncontrollable noise",
