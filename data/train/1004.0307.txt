    "the simplest realization of such a model is considered here , in order to bring out at the qualitative level the microstructure effect on the magnetization curve .",
    "this model is treated in the framework of micromagnetism , _",
    "i.e. _ through a continuous medium type of approach , and the calculations are performed by using the @xcite code based on the finite elements method .",

    "[ fig:6 ] ) , which amount to suggest that the anisotropy strengthens the peaks of diffraction of type @xmath33 and at room temperature the easy magnetization direction is parallel to the c - axis .",
    "a similar result is obtained for yco@xmath34fe@xmath35 by @xcite obtained by oriented powder under extern field .      concerning the extrinsic magnetic properties , we have measured hysteresis loops at 10 and 293k for all samples annealed at different temperature ( 750 to 1050@xmath1c for 30min ) and plotted @xmath24 curves . fig .  [ fig:7 ]",
    "show as an example the hysteresis loops measured at 10 and 293k for sample annealed at 750@xmath1c .",

    "the coercivity of 55koe at 10k confirms the large magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "in order to get a first picture of the link between the structure at the nanometric scale and the extrinsic magnetic properties at least at the qualitative level , we have performed micromagnetic simulations on a model for our system .",
    "indeed , micromagnetic simulations provide a useful tool for this purpose and have been done for a wide range of nanocomposite magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that quite generally such simulations deal with models for heterogeneous systems including magnetic grains of different materials , typically hard and soft materials , the purpose being to characterize the exchange @xcite or the magnetostatic coupling between phases @xcite .",
    "the general finding is that the inter - grains exchange coupling leads to a decrease of the coercivity and an increase of remanence when compared to the values of the hard material component .",
    "the magnetostatic coupling may be more complex due to the long ranged and the anisotropy nature of dipolar interactions @xcite . here , we model a biphasic system , the phases of which are of the same chemical composition .",
    "indeed , as we have seen in the experimental section , the as milled sample is amorphous , and then after annealing well crystallized grains whose size is controlled by the annealing temperature are formed .",
    "our purpose , rather than to provide a systematic investigation , is to draw out some of the salient features concerning the sample structure which may explain the shape of the magnetization curve .",
    "we model the experimental sample as an assembly of well crystallized grains , represented by either spherical or cubic inclusions , embedded in the matrix made of the amorphous phase corresponding to the as milled material .",
    "the inclusion shape should be discriminated on physical grounds related to the crystallization growth at the temperature considered .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work , and we will be lead to discriminate the grain shape from the agreement with experimental results .",
    "we emphasize that the main difference between these two cases is the larger relative importance taken by the amorphous matrix , playing the role of grain boundaries , in the model with spherical inclusions .",
    "since the crystallites are well crystallized , they are characterized by the magnetic constants of the perfect massive crystal .",
    "we take the experimental value of the saturation magnetization per unit volume , as deduced from both the saturation magnetization per unit formula @xcite , namely 3.8@xmath43 and the volumic mass as obtained from the measured volume of the unit cell ( see table [ tab : table1 ] ) which corresponds to @xmath44 .",
    "the value of the exchange constant is set equal to that of the archetype of hard material ( nd@xmath6fe@xmath45b ) , namely and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant is fitted on the experimental value of the coercive field we have got at , with the result .",
    "the amorphous matrix is on the one hand non anisotropic ( @xmath46 ) , and on the other hand characterized by a very small value of the exchange constant , set somewhat arbitrarily to @xmath47j / m . indeed , since the coercivity remains very high we expect in our two phase model only a negligible exchange coupling between the matrix and the inclusions . then , concerning the matrix saturation magnetization , we expect a much smaller value than for the crystallized phase of the inclusions @xcite ; therefore we consider either a non magnetic ( ) or only weakly polarized ( ) matrix .",
    "as we shall see these two last points can be justified by the magnetization curve shape .",
    "the inclusions have all the same size , while their easy axis , @xmath48 are distributed either randomly or in a solid angle centered on the direction of the external field , @xmath49 in order to model the effect of the texturation by the field .",
    "the influence of the preferential orientation has been investigated only in the case of spherical inclusions .",
    "the inclusions are located on the sites of simple cubic lattice .",
    "the inclusion packing fraction is therefore limited to values smaller than @xmath50 in the case of spherical inclusions ; we set the nearest neighbor distance @xmath51 close to the minimum value @xmath52 , which leads to @xmath53 .",
    "we have not such limitation when dealing with cubic inclusions . in this later case",
    "the inclusions are separated by a grain boundary of thickness , say @xmath54 , and the volume fraction is then where the inclusion hedge length is set to @xmath55 . in the framework of the micromagnetism",
    ", the value of @xmath54 can not be reduced at will since @xmath54 must not reach the microscopisc scale ; here we consider either or where @xmath56 is the minimum intergrain distance which leads to @xmath57 or 0.445 respectively .",
    "the embedding matrix is a parallepipedic box including 4 layers of 64 lattice sites and the total number of particles taken into account is thus 256 . the applied field is set normal to the layers . in order to simulate as far as possible the experimental case",
    ", we have chosen for the spherical inclusions and for the cubic inclusions . accordingly",
    "the size of the matrix is and in between and in the case of spherical and cubic inclusions respectively .",
    "the micromagnetic calculations are performed by using the code @xcite , based on a finite elements scheme , from either the llg equation or the total energy minimization .",
    "most of the calculations have been performed with a mesh including 1632000 tetrahedra , and we have checked on a refined mesh of 3159000 tetrahedra the convergence versus the element size of the results in the case of spherical inclusions .    the results for the model with spherical inclusions are displayed in figure ( [ fig_simu_sph ] ) .",
    "first of all , we consider the case of the non magnetic matrix ( @xmath58 ) with randomly oriented particles .",
    "as expected , the coercivity takes a large value , namely totally governed by that of the particles , since the exchange constant of the matrix is too low for the particles to be exchanged coupled to and _ via _ the matrix .",
    "we have checked that even with @xmath58 a significant value of the exchange constant for the amorphous matrix leads to a decrease of the coercivity , and this as already mentioned justifies our choice of a very small value of @xmath59 for the matrix .",
    "however , the main qualitative characteristic which is missing in this first calculated magnetization curve when compared to the experimental one is the small kink in the vicinity of zero external field .",
    "such a kink may be the signature of an uncoupled two phase magnetic behavior .",
    "hence , we have increased the value of the matrix saturation magnetization in order to get such a behavior and we find that leads to a qualitative agreement with the experimental curve .",
    "when the matrix @xmath60 value increases the kink amplitude becomes much larger than the experimental one . as a matter of fact",
    ", the kink relative amplitude behaves roughly as @xmath61    the agreement between the calculated hysteresis curve and the experimental one , for randomly distributed axes and @xmath62 t is qualitatively satisfying . we have to mention however , that we display in figure ( [ fig_simu_sph ] ) the magnetization curve reduced by the total saturation magnetization , @xmath63 , of the system the value of which , is significantly smaller than the experimental one .",
    "this is due both to the small value of the saturation magnetization of the amorphous matrix obtained to reproduce the amplitude of the kink at @xmath64 , and to the large fraction of the total volume occupied by the matrix .",
    "the model with cubic inclusions can remedy to this drawback since then the inclusion packing fraction is not limited as already mentioned .",
    "the results obtained with are displayed on figure ( [ fig_simu_cub ] ) for the matrix saturation magnetization @xmath65= 0.05 t , 0.125 t and 0.250 t .",
    "the first conclusion is that at the qualitative level , the hysteresis curve looks like that of the system with spherical inclusions which may be the consequence of the easy axis random orientation .",
    "now , since the matrix volume fraction is strongly reduced , the amplitude of the magnetisation kink due to the matrix magnetization reversal compares to the experimental one with a larger value for @xmath65 than in the model with spherical inclusions , namely .",
    "however , increasing the matrix saturation magnetization leads to an important matrix / inclusion magnetostatic coupling resulting in a non negligible reduction of the coercivity ( see figure [ fig_simu_cub ] ) .",
    "thus the best agreement with the experimental results is obtained with the model with cubic inclusions , @xmath66 and @xmath67 t ( _ i.e. _ @xmath68 ) . with this set of parameters ,",
    "we get for the saturation magnetization of the composite system .",
    "the simulated magnetization curve of the model with cubic inclusions and @xmath53 is quite close to the that of the model with spherical inclusions and is thus not shown .",
    "we also get an important reduction of the coercivity with the increase of the matrix saturation magnetization .",
    "then , and only for the model with spherical inclusions , we have examined the effect of the texturation _ via _ the easy axes distribution . in this calculation , the maximum value of the polar angle @xmath69 of the axes @xmath48 is either @xmath70 or @xmath71 for a strong or a very weak preferential orientation respectively . notice the strong sensitivity to the variation of @xmath72 ; indeed the random distribution corresponds to @xmath73 .",
    "we emphasize that this orientation effect may represent a consequence of a non spherical shape for the particles .",
    "finally , we have also calculated the magnetization curve for particles of size with nearly the same result at least in the case on a non magnetic matrix . therefore ,",
    "as expected , we conclude that the strong size effect observed on the coercivity of nanocomposite materials is mainly due to the dependence of the crystallite magnetic properties on the size .",
    "in summary , the prco@xmath0 intermetallic compound , crystallize in rhombohedral puni@xmath0-type structure ( space group : @xmath25 ) . this compound is a highly anisotropic uniaxial ferromagnet with the easy magnetization direction is parallel to the c - axis .",
    "no saturation reached at room temperature for applied field of 90koe .",
    "high coercivities of about 12koe at 293k and 55koe at 10k can be reached in prco@xmath0 alloy prepared by high - energy milling method followed by annealing at 750@xmath1c for 30min .",
    "high energy milled method following the controlled nanocrystallization brings high magnetic properties with smaller grain size more adequate to favor an available microstructure to perform this properties , so these results show that prco@xmath0compounds are promising materials for permanent magnet applications . from the model calculations of the macroscopic extrinsic properties we can propose a simple picture of the microstructure .",
    "indeed , the magnetization curve presents a signature of a system made of two uncoupled phases : the magnetically hard crystallites and the amorphous matrix .",
    "the presence of the small kink in the magnetization curve is analyzed as the reversal of the matrix magnetization ; the localization of this kink at nearly zero applied field and the its small amplitude are indications that the matrix is , as expected , magnetically very soft and characterized by a small saturation magnetization .",
    "this latter point must be taken with care , since here we propose a simple lattice for the crystallite which may lead to an overestimated fraction of the total volume occupied by the matrix also with the model with cubic inclusions .",
    "it is important to notice that when dealing with the reduced magnetization , @xmath74 we find that the influence of the grain shape is rather weak .",
    "most of the calculations have been performed at the cines ( centre informatique national de lenseignement suprieur ) ."
