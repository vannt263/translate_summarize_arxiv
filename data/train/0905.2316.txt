    "a favorite amongst the new particle candidates is the neutralino , the lightest superpartner predicted by supersymmetry , itself a well - motivated extension of the standard model .    in the supersymmetric dark matter scenario ,",
    "neutralinos have been copiously produced in the beginning of the universe .",
    "the expansion of the universe caused a relic neutralino density in the universe today analogous to the cosmic microwave background .",
    "these relic neutralinos could accumulate in massive celestial bodies in the universe like the sun , thereby increasing the local neutralino annihilation probability . in the annihilation process new particles",

    "located at a depth of about 2.5  km in the mediterranean sea offshore from france , antares is a cherenkov neutrino telescope comprising 12  detection lines in an approximately cylindrical layout .",
    "each line is comprised of up to 25  storeys , each storey contains tubes .",
    "the distance between detection lines is 70 m , and vertically between adjacent storeys 14.5 m , resulting in an instrumented detector volume of about 0.02  km@xmath0 .",
    "the detector was completed in may  2008 .",
    "prior to its completion , antares has been taking data in intermediate configurations of 5  and 10  detector lines for more than one year .",
    "the angular resolution of the telescope depends on the neutrino energy  @xmath1 and is of the order of one degree at low energy ( @xmath2  1  tev ) , relevant to dark matter searches .",
    "the sensitivity of a neutrino telescope is conventionally expressed by the neutrino effective area @xmath3 .",
    "it is defined as    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the detection rate and @xmath6 is the incoming neutrino flux .",
    "the antares effective area ( 12  lines ) for upgoing is shown as a function of the neutrino energy in the low energy regime in fig .",
    "[ neanew_colour ] .",
    "the increase of the effective area with neutrino energy is mainly due to the fact that the neutrino - nucleon cross section as well as the muon range in water are both proportional to the neutrino energy .",

    "several detector designs are explored . in this study ( see sect .",
    "[ sensitivitysect ] ) we assume one of the possible detector configurations , the so - called `` reference detector '' .",
    "this homogeneous cubic configuration consists of 225  ( 15@xmath715 )  detection lines , each line carrying 37  optical modules .",
    "each optical module contains tubes .",
    "the distance between detection lines is 95 m , and vertically between adjacent optical modules 15.5 m , resulting in an instrumented detector volume of 1  km@xmath0 .",
    "we calculated the @xmath8 flux resulting from neutralino annihilation in the centre of the sun . instead of the general supersymmetry scenario",
    ", we used the more constrained approach of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) in which models are characterized by four parameters and a sign :  @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and sgn@xmath13 .",
    "the calculation was done using the darksusy simulation package  @xcite in combination with the renormalisation group evolution package isasugra  @xcite .",
    "we assumed a local neutralino halo density of  0.3  gev / cm@xmath0 . to investigate specifically those msugra models that possess a relic neutralino density  @xmath15 that is compatible with the cold dark matter density  @xmath16 as measured by wmap  @xcite ,",
    "the neutrino flux was calculated for approximately four million msugra models using a random walk method in msugra parameter space based on the metropolis algorithm where  @xmath15 acted as a guidance parameter  @xcite .",
    "we considered only models within the following parameter ranges : and    the resulting @xmath8 flux from the sun , integrated above a threshold energy of , can be seen in the for six different @xmath12 ranges in fig .",
    "[ psflux ] .",
    "models in the so - called focus point region produce the highest solar neutrino flux . in this region of msugra parameter space",
    "the neutralino has a relatively large higgsino component and therefore a large neutralino vector - boson coupling .",
    "this enhances the neutralino capture rate in the sun as well as the neutralino annihilation to vector - bosons , resulting in a relatively high neutrino flux with a relatively hard energy spectrum @xcite . +",
    "the antares detection sensitivity for neutralino annihilation in the sun was determined by considering the irreducible background from atmospheric neutrinos and an additional 10% of that flux due to misreconstructed atmospheric muons in a search cone of 3  degree radius around the sun .",
    "based on the antares effective area in fig .",
    "[ neanew_colour ] , the average background prediction after 3  years of effective data taking is neutrinos .",
    "assuming that only the average background rate will be measured , a 90%  cl upper limit on the neutrino flux from the sun for 3  years of effective data taking was derived , according to  @xcite .",
    "this can be compared to the antares detection rate from the expected neutrino flux from neutralino annihilation in the sun .",

    "the sensitivity of antares is sufficient to put constraints on parts of the focus point region of msugra parameter space , while km3net would be sensitive to most of this region .",
    "the data taken during the operation of the first 5  lines ( jan - dec 07 ) were used to search for a possible excess in the neutrino flux from the sun .",
    "the effective livetime of this period corresponds to 68.4  days , reduced from the full 164  days due to detector dead - time and the condition that the sun has to be below the horizon .",
    "the number of observed neutrinos in a search cone around the sun is shown in fig .  [ n_vs_cone_official ] as a function of the search cone radius .",
    "the expected number of background events from monte carlo simulation is in good agreement with the estimation obtained by randomising the direction and arrival time of the observed events . the upper limit and sensitivity on the number of signal events according to  @xcite",
    "is also shown .",
    "the corresponding upper limit on the neutrino flux from the sun was calculated as a function of the neutralino mass assuming two extreme annihilation cases : pure annihilation into vector - bosons and into @xmath17  quarks only , referred to as `` hard '' and `` soft '' annihilation respectively .",
    "the neutrino energy spectra at earth for both cases were calculated as a function of the neutralino mass using the simulation package wimpsim  @xcite , assuming the standard oscillation scenario .",
    "the search cone used in both cases was optimized as a function of the neutralino mass by monte carlo simulation before data analysis . the resulting upper limit at 90%  cl on the neutrino flux from the sun , integrated above a threshold energy of , can be seen for both cases in fig .",
