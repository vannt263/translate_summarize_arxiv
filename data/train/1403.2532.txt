    "m  67 is one of the most studied open clusters among the known open clusters with ages comparable to or older than the sun .",
    "m  67 is of solar metallicity , relatively nearby and has low interstellar reddening .",
    "it has been comprehensively studied by many authors to establish astrometric membership @xcite .",
    "many photometric studies @xcite and rather precise radial velocity and binary search study @xcite have been conducted for the cluster .",
    "the fundamental parameters along with absolute proper motions have been listed in table 1 .",
    "m  67 moves far above the galactic disk on latitude @xmath3 , on @xmath4  pc along quite a circular orbit and interacts with spiral density waves , which can initiate star formation . using 2mass @xmath5 photometry , @xcite suggested an age of 3.5 gyr using two different theoretical isochrones .",
    ".the fundamental parameters for m  67 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     with this @xmath6-value , we have detected the clumps among stars with @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] ) .",
    "parameters of the clumps are listed in table  [ tab7 ] .",
    "it is seen that the central part of the cluster is homogeneous ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] ) .",
    "its radius is @xmath8 .",
    "this is in agreement with the estimate of the core radius from @xcite .",
    "a more distant region is fragmented ( points shown with different symbols in fig .  [ figu7 ] ) .",
    "there are several groups which include five or more stars .",
    "if we use other sample of stars ( for example , with @xmath9 ) , we obtain another @xmath6-value , but the clumps are detected at the same places with different number of stars . with a decrease in the @xmath6-value , the number of clumps and the number of stars in clumps are increased , and vice versa .",
    "@xcite used smaller sample that led to bigger @xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) and a little less number of groups were allocated ( 5 against 16 in this work ) .",
    "the group sizes and the number of stars in them are very similar .",
    "an exact comparison is impossible due to the different areas covered .",
    "this study is restricted to the central area but deeper data while @xcite studied the corona up to @xmath11 around @xmath12 mag .",
    "the spaces between ccds in wfi@2.2 m are the star free regions seen in fig .",
    "[ figu7 ] .",
    "the value used for @xmath13 is much less than the width of these bands .",
    "this means that the stellar population , located in blanks , may somewhat change the result .",
    "so the results can be improved with wider area of observation with no gaps in the detector .        for the test of completeness of stars in yadav08 catalogue ,",
    "the homogeneous photometry was taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the comparison was done in the same observational area and a histogram is shown in fig .",
    "the comparison was made in @xmath14-magnitude of the sdss photometric system . for the comparison purpose",
    ", we converted the @xmath11 magnitude of yadav08 catalogue to the sdss @xmath14-magnitudes with the formula @xmath15 .",
    "the histograms of the converted @xmath14-magnitudes and sdss @xmath14-magnitudes are given in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "for the histograms , we have 1917 stars from yadav08 catalogue and 2375 stars from sdss up to @xmath16 mag .",
    "the difference between the two samples is of 458 stars .",
    "therefore , 19% loss of stars in yadav08 catalogue may be due to the blanks on mosaic ccds .",
    "however , there is a surplus of stars in the yadav08 catalogue in the @xmath14-magnitude bin of 1213 mag .",
    "this can be due to the photometry in the brighter end of yadav08 being better than the sdss .",
    "from the present analysis for m  67 open cluster , the following main conclusions can be drawn :    1 .",
    "the apex coordinates for m  67 have been calculated as : @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   the membership of the stars has been revisited . in future , it is possible to decide membership by distance from @xmath18-box and by position of the star in `` @xmath19''-diagram . if @xmath20 is close to zero , the membership probability is higher ( within errors and peculiar velocities dispersion ) .",
    "ad - diagram has been constructed for stars with known radial velocities .",
    "the membership status for the star can be estimated with the help of ad - diagram .",
    "the farther away a star located from the apex position , there will be the less probability for it to be a cluster member .",
    "we found substructures in the corona of m  67 .",
    "we found heterogeneity in the core periphery , like our previous work @xcite .",
    "authors are highly thankful to an anonymous referee for a careful reading of the draft and providing with useful scientific and constructive comments .",
    "this work is done under a joint research collaboration project , titled `` photometric and kinematical studies of the galactic disk population '' between russia and india .",
    "the project code is int / iltp / b-3.21 ( 2010 - 2013 ) .",
