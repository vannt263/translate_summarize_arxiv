    "accordingly , the solution of the non - homogeneous equation is obtained by quadrature , using as a kernel the wronskian of the associated homogeneous equation  whose solution can be preliminarily found by constants variation as well .    the main achievement is the integration of the differential equation for exact value of the parameters ( mandelstam invariants and dimensional - parameter ) .",

    "this qualitative information is sufficient for the quantitative determination of the arbitrary integration constants . at the diagrammatic level",
    ", boundary conditions usually correspond to integrals related to simpler diagrams .",
    "the use of differential equation in the external invariants is a very powerful tool for computing feynman ( master ) integrals .",
    "dimensional regularization was fundamental for the derivation of the differential equations we discussed in this review .",
    "+ in principle differential identities for integral functions can be derived whenever it is allowed by the algebra of the integral representation under use - as induced by integration - by - parts . and their use is not limited to the perturbative description of feynman diagrams",

    "<S> we review in a pedagogical way the method of differential equations for the evaluation of d - dimensionally regulated feynman integrals . after dealing with the general features of the technique </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss its application in the context of one- and two - loop corrections to the photon propagator in qed , by computing the vacuum polarization tensor exactly in d. finally , we treat two cases of less trivial differential equations , respectively associated to a two - loop three - point , and a four - loop two - point integral . </S>",
    "<S> these two examples are the playgrounds for showing more technical aspects about : laurent expansion of the differential equations in d ( around d=4 ) ; the choice of the boundary conditions ; and the link among differential and difference equations for feynman integrals .    preface [ preface ]    that `` _ differentiating _ is an operation easier than _ integrating _ '' is a statement that should not sound too surprising ; while , a more pleasant wonder might result when suitable _ differentiations _ make us reduce , if not avoid at all , the number of direct _ integrations _ - of course the two operations , being the inverse of each other , have not to be thought as performed with respect to the same variable !    as paradigmatic example , let us just consider the class of integrals , @xmath0 for @xmath1 , this is just the gaussian integral , @xmath2 while for @xmath3 , the integrand is integrable by quadrature , @xmath4 to compute @xmath5 with @xmath6 , one can use the identity , @xmath7 in fact ,    * @xmath8 @xmath9 * @xmath10 @xmath11    therefore the infinite set of integrals @xmath5 can be computed without any integration , provided the knowledge of just two basic integrals , namely @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , that in the forthcoming terminology would be defined as the _ master integrals _ of the class @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above example was a too lucky one : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ the repeated @xmath14-derivative did not entangle integrals having even and odd indices , therefore @xmath12 and @xmath13 never appear linked by any differential identity ; _ ii ) _ the value of the master integrals was known , possibly obtained by direct integrations .    in the more general case masters are unknown , and their evaluation becomes an open problem . in the following pages , we will see how the exploitation of integration - by - parts not only yields algebraic relations among infinite sets of integrals and their masters , but as well leads to differential equations satisfied by the master integrals themselves . solving these differential equations becomes a tool for computing master integrals , when their direct integration is not viable . + as it happens to ( many ) feynman integrals .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction [ intro ]    a perturbative approach to the quantitative description of the scattering of particles in quantum field theory involves the computation of feynman diagrams . for a given number of external particles - the _ legs _ of diagram - fixed by the process under study , and a given order in perturbation theory , </S>",
    "<S> the skeletons of diagrams are built up by joining the edges of legs and propagators into vertexes , forming _ </S>",
    "<S> tree _ </S>",
    "<S> patterns and closed loops . </S>",
    "<S> + beyond the tree level , each feynman diagram represents an integral which has , in general , a tensorial structure , induced by the tensorial nature of the interacting fields . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the result of its evaluation must be a linear combination of the tensors provided by the theory and by the kinematics of the process under study . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients of this linear combination , usually called _ </S>",
    "<S> form factors _ , can be always extracted from each feynman diagram , before performing any evaluation , by means of suitably chosen projectors . </S>",
    "<S> + these form factors are _ scalar integrals _ </S>",
    "<S> closely connected to the original feynman diagram : the numerator of their integrand may contain all the possible scalar products formed by external momenta and loop variables ; whereas its denominator is formed by the denominators of propagators present in the diagram itself . </S>",
    "<S> + due to the bad convergence of loop integrals in four dimensions , regularization prescriptions are mandatory . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter the integrals are regularised within the framework of t hooft - veltman continuous - dimensional regularisation scheme@xcite . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> , the dimension @xmath15 of an extended integration space is used as a regulator for both infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences , which finally do appear as poles in @xmath16 when @xmath15 goes to 4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the aim of a precise calculation is to compute feynman diagrams for any value of the available kinematic invariants . except in case of simple configurations ( e.g. very few legs and/or few scales ) , </S>",
    "<S> quite generally , approximations have to be taken by limiting the result to a specific kinematics domain , and , thus , looking for a hierarchy among the scales , to get rid of the ones which anyhow would give a negligible contribution in that domain .    </S>",
    "<S> the puzzling complexity of the feynman diagrams calculation arises because of two different sources : either multi - leg or multi - loop processes . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> the progress in the evaluation of higher loop radiative corrections in quantum field theory has received a strong boost , due to the optimisation and automatising of various techniques ( see refs . in @xcite ) . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we review one of the most effective computational tools which have been developed in the framework of the dimensional regularization : the method of _ differential equations for feynman integrals_. + the method was first proposed by kotikov@xcite in the early nineties , while dealing with the evaluation of 2- and 3-point functions . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea was to consider a given unknown integral as a function of one of the propagator masses , and to write for it a differential equation in that variable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , instead of addressing its direct integration , the value of the integral could be found by solving the differential equation .    </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of the novel ideas were soon realized @xcite , and generalised at a later stage by remiddi @xcite , who proposed the differentiation with respect to any other available kinematics invariants formed by the external momenta . that enabled the application of the differential equation method also to integral with massless propagators ( provided the existence of any other non - trivial scale ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , remiddi and gehrmann @xcite fully developed the method by showing its effectiveness through the systematic application to a non - trivial class of two - loop four - point functions , whose result is still considered as state - of - the - art .    from that moment on , the method of differential equations became to be widely used in different contexts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lists of unprecedented results obtained through its application spans among multi - loop functions from zero to four external legs , @xcite and within the most interesting sectors of particle phenomenology , like jets physics @xcite ; qed corrections to lepton form factors @xcite ; bhabha scattering @xcite ; qcd corrections to lepton form factors and top - physics @xcite , forward - backward asymmetry of heavy - quark @xcite ; higgs physics @xcite ; electroweak sector @xcite ; sudakov form factors @xcite ; semileptonic decay @xcite ; static parameters and gauge boson properties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the efforts to achieve analytic solutions of differential equations for feynman integrals has stimulated new developments on the more mathematical side @xcite , especially concerning the properties of transcendental functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a novel set of functions that generalize nielsen polylogarithms , the so called harmonic polylogarithms ( hpl ) @xcite , have been found suitable for casting the result in _ analytic _ form - that means without ambiguities due to zeroes hidden in functional relations , and supplied with series expansions . while hpl s can be considered as iterative integral of rational kernels , recently it has been pointed out that the solution of differential equations for generic integrals with massive loops demands as well for irrational integration kernels , yielding elliptic functions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the range of applicability of the differential equations technique is broadened by the possibility of a natural switch toward a semi - numerical approach , since , whenever the analytic integration were not required or not viable , the differential equation(s ) , analytically obtained , could be solved with numerical techniques @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nowadays we are not at the point to have _ the _ method for evaluating any feynman integral , but certainly we dispose of several tools @xcite to attack successfully many problems in perturbation theory , and usually a combination of them is necessary for the achievement of the final answer . </S>",
    "<S> therefore let us discuss in detail how to build ans solve differential equations for integral associated to feynman graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> the computational strategy is twofold .    * in a preliminary stage , by exploiting some remarkable properties of the dimensionally regularised integrals , namely _ integration - by - parts identities _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ibp ) , _ lorentz invariance identities _ ( li ) , </S>",
    "<S> and further sets of identities due to kinematic symmetry specific of each diagram , one establishes several relations among the whole set of scalar integrals associated to the original feynman diagram . </S>",
    "<S> + by doing so , one reduces the result , initially demanding for a large number of scalar integrals ( from hundreds to billions , according to the case ) , to a combination of a minimal set ( usually of the order of tens ) of independent functions , the so called _ master integrals _ ( mi s ) . + * the second phase consists of the actual evaluation of the mi s . by using the set of identities previously obtained , it is also possible to write differential equations in the kinematic invariants which are satisfied by the mi s themselves . </S>",
    "<S> when possible , these equations can be solved exactly in @xmath15 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , they can be laurent - expanded around suitable values of the dimensional parameter up to the required order , obtaining a system of chained differential equations for the coefficients of the expansions , which , in the most general case , are finally integrated by euler s _ variation of constants _ method .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the key advantages of the method is that it yields a clear separation between the merely algebraic part of the work - which is , not surprisingly , always very heavy in multiloop calculations , and can be most conveniently processed by a computer algebra program@xcite- , from the actual analytic issues of the problem , which can then be better investigated without the disturbance of the algebraic complexity . </S>",
    "<S> + the paper is organised as follows . in section 2 , it is described how to reduce a generic ( combination of ) feynman integrals to a limited set of mi s and how to write the system of _ differential equations _ they fulfil . as illustrative applications , </S>",
    "<S> respectively in section 3 - 4 , the one - loop and two - loop vacuum polarization functions in qed are explicitly computed . in the further two sections , we discuss some less obvious example of differential equations . in section 5 </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the solution of a system of three coupled first - order differential equations , to compute three mi s associated to a class of two - loop 3-point functions , addressing as well the problem of finding their boundary conditions . while in section 5 </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the solution of a fourth - order differential equation involving the mi s of a 4-loop 2-point diagram , and it will be considered the link between differential and _ difference equation _ for feynman integrals @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> reduction to master integrals    topologies and integrals    let us consider a feynman diagram with @xmath17 loops , @xmath18 external legs , @xmath19 internal lines and a given tensorial structure . </S>",
    "<S> such a diagram , when not representing a scalar quantity , can be decomposed as a combination of products of a scalar form factor times a tensor . </S>",
    "<S> thus , computing the contribution of any diagram to a given process is equivalent to the computation of scalar factors , which , after some preliminary algebra ( evaluation of dirac traces and contraction of lorentz indices ) reads as a combination of scalar integrals like , @xmath20 where    * @xmath21 is any scalar product formed by either one of independent external momentum and an internal loop momentum , or by two internal loop momenta ( @xmath22 is an integer exponent such that @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the total number of such scalar products , given by @xmath25 * @xmath26 is the denominator of the @xmath27-th propagator being @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , the corresponding momentum and mass . from now , we call @xmath30 _ propagator_.    the first task relies on a suitable classification of the integrals , in order to minimize the number of the ones which have to be actually integrated .    as a preliminary set up , </S>",
    "<S> one is invited to consider not anymore diagrams but _ topologies _ , that , drawn exactly as scalar feynman diagrams , contain only and all different propagators ( and scalar vertices ) . in view of settling down a correspondence between a given topology and the class of integrals it represents </S>",
    "<S> , one proceeds by simplifying as well the number of scalar products in the numerator . </S>",
    "<S> the number @xmath24 is a redundant quantity and can be easily reduced , with a procedure commonly called _ </S>",
    "<S> trivial tensor reduction _ , according to which some ( when not all ) of the scalar products can be expressed in terms of the denominators of the topology .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , if @xmath31 is the number of propagators of a given topology , we can express @xmath31 of the @xmath24 scalar products containing the loop momenta in terms of the denominators - which will be later on simplified against the corresponding term in the denominator . </S>",
    "<S> thus the most general integral associated to every topology does contain only the remaining @xmath32 _ irreducible _ scalar products and reads as @xmath33 where @xmath23 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> + one can denote with @xmath35 the class of the integrals with : a given set of @xmath31 denominators ; @xmath36 irreducible scalar products ; a total of @xmath37 powers of the @xmath31 denominators ; and @xmath38 powers of the @xmath39 scalar products . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the number of the integrals belonging to the class @xmath35 is @xmath40    in the next sections , we will see that integrals of the type ( [ intro : eq9 ] ) , belonging to a given topology , therefore differing for the values of the indices @xmath41 , are not independent . </S>",
    "<S> algebraic relations among them , can be written in the form of a sum of a finite number of terms set equal to zero , where each term is given by the product of a polynomial ( of finite order and with integer coefficients in the variable @xmath15 , masses and mandelstam invariants ) and one of the integrals belonging to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> they can be used recursively to express as many as possible integrals of a given class in terms of as few as possible ( suitably chosen ) ones . the way to generate those kind of relations goes through integration - by - parts , lorentz invariance and symmetry considerations .    before going on with the discussion let us see explicitly how the general definition we have introduced do apply in practice .    </S>",
    "<S> integration - by - parts identities integration - by - parts identities ( ibp - id s ) are among the most remarkable properties of dimensionally regularized integrals and they were first proposed in the eighties by chetyrkin and tkachov @xcite . the basic idea underlying </S>",
    "<S> ibp - id s is an extension to @xmath15-dimensional spaces of gauss theorem . for each of the integrals defined in equation ( [ intro : eq9 ] ) one can write the vanishing of the integral of a divergence given by , @xmath42 in the above identities the index @xmath43 runs over the number of loops @xmath44 , and the vector @xmath45 can be any of the @xmath46 independent vectors of the problem:@xmath47 ; in such way , for each integrand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath48 ibp - id s can be established . </S>",
    "<S> when evaluating explicitly the derivatives , one obtains a combination of integrands with a total power of the irreducible scalar products equal to @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and total powers of the propagators in the denominator equal to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , therefore involving , besides the integrals of the class @xmath54 , also the classes @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . simplifications between reducible scalar products and propagators in the denominator may occur , lowering the powers of the propagators . during that simplification , some propagator might disappear , generating an integral belonging to a _ </S>",
    "<S> subtopology _ , with @xmath58 propagators . </S>",

    "<S> the number of all the integrals involved in the identities exceeds the number of equations ; but , in writing down systematically all the equations for increasing values of @xmath75 and @xmath50 the number of equations grows faster than the number of the integrals , generating an apparently overconstrained system of equations  as realized first by stefano laporta @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after its generation one is left with the problem of solving such a linear system of identities which is trivial in principle , but algebraically very lengthy , so that some organization is needed for achieving the solution@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + to this end , one can order the integrals in an appropriate way . in particular a `` weight '' </S>",
    "<S> is assigned to each integral : the weight can be almost any increasing function of the indices @xmath22 and @xmath29 , such that integrals with higher indices have bigger weights . </S>",
    "<S> the system can be solved by gauss substitution rule , by considering the equations of the system one by one , and using each equation for expressing the integral with the highest weight in terms of the integrals of lower weight . </S>",
    "<S> then the result is substituted in the leftover equations . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm , by now known as _ </S>",
    "<S> laporta algorithm _ , is straightforward , but its execution requires a great amount of algebra , which has been implemented in several computer codes@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one finds that several equations are identically satisfied , and the original unknown integrals are expressed in terms of very few independent integrals , the _ master integrals _ ( mi s ) . in doing so , the resulting mi s correspond to the integrals of lowest weight ; but as the choice of the weight is to a large extent arbitrary , there is also some freedom in the choice of the integrals to pick up as actual mi s ( not in their number of course ! ) . </S>",
    "<S> + there are several cases in which more than one mi is found for a given topology , while sometimes only one mi is present . </S>",
    "<S> it may also happen that no mi for the considered topology is left over in the reduction  _ i.e. _ all the integrals corresponding to a given topology , with @xmath31 propagators , can be expressed in terms of the mi s of its subtopologies with @xmath76 , and/or less , propagators . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case one speaks about _ </S>",
    "<S> reducible topologies_.    finally , three points are worth mentioning . </S>",
    "<S> + first , any given topology with @xmath31 propagators has @xmath76 subtopologies with @xmath76 propagators , @xmath77 subtopologies with @xmath78 propagators etc . </S>",
    "<S> , down to as many propagators as the number of loops . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out , however , that many subtopologies are in fact equivalent , up to a translation of the loop variable , and the subtopologies coming from the contribution of different graphs do overlap to a great extent . for these reasons </S>",
    "<S> the compilation of the system for the actual number of all _ independent _ topologies , namely those that can not be transformed one into the others by a redefinition of internal momenta , is relatively small .    </S>",
    "<S> the second remark is about the _ independence _ of the identities for a given topology . under an idealistic point of view </S>",
    "<S> , it might happen that the infinite set if ibp - id s , obtained by considering the infinite choices of indices of denominators and scalar products for the considered topology , plus the infinite set of ibp - id s of all the _ parent _ topologies containing it as a subtopology , could include li - id s and symmetry relations as subset . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , at the practical level , since one is working with finite sets of indices , li - id s and symmetry relations can be considered as _ additional _ to the ibp - id s , which surely speed up the solution of the system and work as further checks of the reduction procedure . </S>",
    "<S> + third , we are not able to prove analytically that the mi s one finds are really the minimal set of mi s , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ that they are independent from each other ; in any case the final number of the mi s is quite small , so that reducing the several hundred integrals occurring in a typical calculation to a few of them is after all a great progress . </S>",
    "<S> studies on the _ apriori _ determination of whether a topology could have or not mi s , have been performed by baikov @xcite and smirnov @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although a general algorithm is still lacking , we think that the analysis of leading and subleading landau singularities ( see @xcite for an extensive treatment ) could be related to this issue : since a reducible topology without mi s is expressible in terms of the mi s of its subtopologies , it should mean that the leading singularities of the reducible topology are not independent of the subleading ones , which are leading singularities for the subtopologies .    as a last remark , </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that , at the end of the reduction , there is some freedom for choosing the basis of mi s and usually the choice is in general motivated by convenience . for example the behaviour of the functions in the @xmath15-to-4 expansion might determine to select : _ </S>",
