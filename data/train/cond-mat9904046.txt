    "the presence of minibands has been probed directly by investigating the transmission of ballistic electrons through short semiconductor superlattices @xcite . in recent experiments",
    "the quenching of the miniband structure by an applied electric field was also demonstrated @xcite .",
    "comparison of further experiments with theoretical calculations indicated a strong influence of scattering on the transmission , and it was argued that interface roughness might cause significant deviations from pure ballistic transmission through the sample@xcite .    a good understanding of the transmission characteristics through short superlattices is important as these structures are used as energy filters .",
    "for example , in quantum cascade lasers , superlattice filters are used to selectively populate the upper energy level of the active region @xcite . the most straightforward way to calculate the transmission through a superlattice is the transfer matrix method @xcite .",

    "recently such an approach has been presented for a full calculation of the current through a resonant tunneling diode where both interface roughness and phonon scattering have been taken into account @xcite . however , these simulations use a fine grid and are hence unsuitable for longer structures such as superlattices consisting of many wells , since the number of grid points increases dramatically .    in this paper",
