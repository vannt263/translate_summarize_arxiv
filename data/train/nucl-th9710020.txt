    "now that first results from experiments performed at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jefferson lab ) are becoming available , the details of the two nucleon current may be explored in great detail . some of the new experiments will probe the short range structure of this current , which can be interpreted as arising from the exchange of quarks and gluons , or alternatively , from meson exchange and the excitation of virtual excited states of the nucleons . in this paper",
    "we turn our attention to virtual contributions from these nucleon excited states .",
    "the effects of nucleon resonances ( or excited states ) are obvious above the production threshold ; it is less obvious what effect they will have on cross sections and observables measured well below the production threshold .",
    "denoting the _ mass _ of the final state in electron scattering by @xmath3 , and the square of the four momentum transfer by @xmath4 , we try to answer the following question : `` if @xmath3 lies below the threshold for the physical excitation of nucleon resonances , does their existance nevertheless affect the high @xmath5 behavior of form factors and structure functions ? '' to study this question we introduce the `` tower of states '' model .",
    "this is a simple , dynamical model for the study of nucleon resonances which can make easy , but admittedly rough , predictions of the effects that might be seen at places like jefferson lab .",
    "the goal is to use this simple model to get a qualitative feeling of where effects due to resonances will be large .",
    "any such model must be compatible with highly successful theories of @xmath2 interactions @xcite  @xcite which have gone before .",
    "motivated by previous work @xcite and the relativistic work of tjon and collaborators @xcite  @xcite we use manifestly covariant dynamics .",
    "when working at the level of a few gev , as at jefferson lab , one must use relativistic equations .",
    "the model is constructed so that gauge invariance is satisfied exactly .",
    "this requires the introduction of an interaction current which is derived from the strong kernel . finally , the model is analytically solvable , allowing for simple calculations of various properties of the @xmath2 system .",
    "many of these features have appeared in earlier models , but , to our knowledge , this is the first time the contributions from resonances and their corresponding interaction currents have been systematically applied to the study of the deuteron form factor using a simple model which is analytically solvable , covariant , and gauge invariant .    in this first study",
    "we use the simplest possible potential ( rank - one separable ) , with a minimal number of free parameters ( five , at most ) .",
    "we fix all free parameters by fitting the @xmath2 phase shifts below lab energies of 350 mev .",
    "all deuteron properties ( binding energy , wavefunctions , form factors ) are then calculated from the model .",
    "our treatment of the nucleon resonances varies somewhat from earlier works .",
    "most models have considered the addition of only one additional resonance , usually the @xmath6 ( ref .",
    "@xcite is an exception , however , but see the discussion in ref .",
    "such channels have been considered as add - ons to existing successful @xmath2 models @xcite , or used to increase the applicability of such models @xcite .",
    "previous calculations of the deuteron form factor using separable models have usually ignored the interaction current which should accompany the calculation .",
    "the philosophy behind our treatment is that the resonances and their interaction currents should be consistently included on an equal footing from the beginning .",
    "since we wish to keep this first exploration of the contribution of resonances as simple as possible , we have neglected spin ( all particles in the following discussions are scalar ) , and used a basic separable four - point interaction diagram as the kernel with a `` tower '' consisting of only three states .",
    "a tabakin - style form factor , similar to the one used by rupp and tjon @xcite , is employed in order to realistically model the contributions of meson exchange without actually having to deal with its complexities .",
    "we compare results from a three member tower with those obtained from a purely elastic scattering model ( a one member tower , in our language ) .",
    "therefore , any differences between the models which include higher resonances and those which do not are due to the presence of the resonances . clearly , if differences between these models can be seen even at this basic level , then further investigation with more complicated systems is warranted .    in this section",
    "we begin with an overview of the techniques used in formulating the model , and then discuss the results of this work .",
    "particular attention is paid to the effects of inelasticity on the tower models . at the end of this section we present our conclusions .",
    "[ general ] includes a full development of the model , including the solution of the relativistic scattering equation , proof of unitarity , a proof of gauge invariance , and the development of the deuteron form factor .",
    "the relations used for inelastic scattering are also derived . in order to maintain gauge invariance ,",
    "contributions from an interaction current are required , since the kernel of the this model is dependent on the center - of - mass four - momentum .",
    "the interaction current is fully derived in the appendix , and the contributions from the interaction current prove to be very important to several facets of the @xmath2 system . finally , sec .",
    "[ tower ] includes some specific details of the models .",
    "the tower of states model is built upon the idea that , in the process of repeated scattering with a neutron , a proton may  sample \" any one of its higher order resonances ( the `` tower '' ) .",
    "that is , the proton and neutron interact , causing the proton to become a virtual roper for a short period of time before interacting again with the neutron . in successive scatterings ,",
    "multiple samplings of this tower of higher resonant states could occur .",
    "we explore the effects that such sampling will have on various properties of the @xmath2 system , particularly the properties of the deuteron where all inelastic contributions are virtual .    as a brief overview of the techniques used in formulating the model , we begin with the most general form of the relativistic scattering equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the relativistic kernel , _",
    "g _ is the propagator , and @xmath9 is specified by choosing a particular formalism , such as bethe - salpeter @xcite , blankenbecler - sugar @xcite , or spectator @xcite@xcite .",
    "the basic four - point interaction between a member of the tower and a neutron shown in fig .",
    "[ kernel ] is chosen as the kernel .",
    "the coupling strengths are denoted by the coupling matrix @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote members of the tower .",
    "we include a tabakin - style form factor @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the relative momentum between the neutron and the tower member and @xmath16 is the center of mass four - momentum ( for a detailed definition of the form factor , see sec .",
    "[ specific ] ) .",
    "as shown by rupp and tjon @xcite , and again here for a one - member tower called model 1 , the tabakin form factor allows one to successfully model the @xmath2 system without having to actually perform meson exchange calculations .",
    "since spin is being neglected at this time , all particles have scalar propagators .",
    "finally , we choose to work in the spectator formalism @xcite@xcite , which has proven to be very useful in describing the @xmath2 system @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for simplicity in this first treatment , we will treat the @xmath17 system only , and discard the isospn formalism , so that the neutron and proton are nonidentical particles .",
    "the spectator formalism is then simplified if the neutral particle , i.e.  the neutron , is placed consistently on its mass shell and excluded from the tower of states .",
    "the towers will contain the proton and its charged excited states only .",
    "these choices are not made arbitrarily .",
    "each has been specifically chosen to reduce the complexity of the system in some way without losing the essential physics . by constructing a very basic , separable kernel",
    ", the @xmath18-matrix may be obtained analytically ( see sec .",
    "[ general ] for the full details ) .",
    "neglecting spin is , of course , an automatic reduction of complexity useful for this first treatment of the problem .",
    "the choice of the spectator formalism motivates the initial inclusion of only one tower ( since one particle is on shell , it is natural to restrict it to its ground state , although a more complete treatment can be developed later ) and is chosen because it is easily extended to more complex cases .",
    "finally , treating the proton and neutron as nonidentical particles and neglecting the distribution of charge inside the neutron allows us to restrict the electromagnetic interaction to the tower members ; the neutron does not interact with the photon in the naive models considered here .",
    "once the scattering equation has been solved , we obtain the @xmath1-wave phase shifts , @xmath19 , and inelasticity parameters , @xmath20 , from the usual representation of the inelastic scattering amplitude @xmath21 where @xmath22 ( not to be confused with the inelastic phase angle @xmath23 ) is the relativistic phase space factor given in eq .",
    "( [ phsspc ] ) below .",
    "the free parameters of the models are then fit to the nijmegen 1993 phase shifts below 350 mev @xcite .",
    "excellent fits are obtained using towers with either one or three members .",
    "fits using a two member tower were attempted , but proved to be less successful than those obtained from one- and three - member towers .",
    "the reason for these poor fits is under investigation ; it may be related to the need for a certain symmetry between the coupling constants . due to the larger number of free parameters , @xmath24s for three - member tower models",
    "are slightly improved over those using only the proton .",
    "these results will be presented in sec .",

    "we choose @xmath27 so the photon itself can not excite or de - excite members of the tower . in order to satisfy gauge invariance an interaction current",

    "<S> the sensitivity of the deuteron form factor to contributions from the excited states of the nucleon is explored using a simple model of the nucleon - nucleon interaction which employs a tower of charged nucleon resonances . </S>",

    "<S> the consequences of this model are studied in the simplest possible framework . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that all particles have spin zero and that the tower has only three charged members , which consist of the proton , the roper , and a higher state in the vicinity of the @xmath0 . </S>",
