    "using the value of relative density fluctuations @xmath57 within the region where our mixing takes place we can derive an analytic estimate for the velocity of the dense blobs causing the finger - like structures , if we assume that the blobs arise from a dynamic instability @xcite . with @xmath58 ,",
    "inferred from our simulation ( fig.[fig.fingall]a ) , we find @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the gravitational acceleration at the base of the convection zone , and @xmath61 the approximate length of the fingers .",
    "the above estimate agrees well with the results of an analysis of our simulation , where the gas inside the fingers sinks at a bit smaller velocities ranging from @xmath62up to @xmath63 .",
    "it confirms that the `` buoyancy work '' ( @xmath64 ) is consistent with the acceleration of gas seen in the simulation . while the initial background state is dynamically stable ( according to ledoux and schwarzschild )",
    ", these flow properties suggests that the mixing takes place on a dynamic timescale .",
    "this apparent contradiction is addressed in  [ sec : linear - stability ] .",
    "the development of the flow at @xmath65 s is depicted in figure  [ fig.caflfing]a ,  d.    _ carbon flash convection .  _ a similar mixing process also appears in the carbon - flash model .",
    "a snapshot showing various quantities in the lower half of the carbon burning shell convection zone and the underlying stable layer is presented in figure  [ fig.caflfing]b ,  e and can be seen to develop in a similar manner to the he flash model .    in this model , however , the initial structure of the stable layers is slightly different from that in the helium - flash model .",
    "when the model was mapped onto our hydrodynamic grid and allowed to adjust to hydrostatic equilibiurm , some narrow bands within the stable layers appeared which were unstable to convection .",
    "this was due merely to the differences between the stellar evolution code and hydrodynamics grid as well as the fact that the stable layer was only marginally stable .",
    "these narrow unstable regions quickly mixed , and stabilized , producing a slight stair stepping and shallow chemical discontinuities in the stable layer rather than a smooth profile as in the initial stellar model .",
    "besides this initial transient , however , the evolution between this model and the helium flash model proceed in the same manner .                    _ oxygen shell burning .  _ in contrast to the helium- and carbon - flash convection cases , the stable layer residing beneath the oxygen shell burning zone does not undergo noticeable mixing over similar timescales .",
    "this is an interesting observation because the overall structure of the oxygen burning shell is remarkably similar to the flash convection cases , except for the mean molecular weight gradient , which is positive in the oxygen burning case .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the molecular weight gradient is responsible , or at least , connected to the mixing seen in the shell convection models .",
    "we also point out that the buoyancy frequency @xmath66 under convection shell is significantly higher than in the previous two cases indicating stronger dynamic stability ( figure  [ fig.caflfing]c ,  f ) , which could simply suppress the mixing .    ) and composition gradient @xmath67 plane .",
    "the region above the diagonal is dynamically unstable according to the ledoux criterion ( eq.[eq : stability ] ) .",
    "the lower right quadrant is dynamically stable , while the `` semiconvection '' and `` thermohaline '' regions are dynamically stable , but unstable on thermal timescales . ]",
    "+         as a starting point to analyze the mixing we consider the linear stability of the regions in question , the standard approach to determine the mixing properties in 1d stellar evolution codes . for adiabatic displacements",
    ", the condition for stability is often written in terms of the temperature and compositions gradients , and reads    @xmath68    where the stellar structure gradients are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the thermodynamic derivatives are @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "this stability condition is known as the ledoux criterion for convective stability @xcite and it measures the degree to which the background is `` superadiabatic '' . in a homogeneous composition medium",
    "the stability condition reads @xmath75 , which is known as the schwarzschild criterion and is equivalent to the statement that positive entropy gradients ( @xmath76 ) are stabilizing , negative entropy gradients are destabilizing , and zero entropy gradients result in neutral buoyancy upon displacement in the linear regime when pressure equilibrium is maintained @xcite . the composition term in eq .",
    "[ eq : stability ] accounts for the buoyancy due to mean molecular weight gradients in the medium .",
    "the stability condition ( eq.[[eq : stability ] ] ) can be identified with the region in the `` nabla - plane '' below the line described by @xmath77 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : nabla ] . above this line",
    "the fluid is subject to dynamical instability ( e.g. , thermal convection , rayleigh - taylor instabilities ) , while below the line the fluid is in a dynamically stable regime .",
    "but what about non - adiabatic effects",
    "? the regions in this plane labeled `` semiconvection '' and `` thermohaline '' are in fact unstable on thermal timescales due to secular instabilities , and their linear growth properties have been analyzed for a sampling of astrophysical conditions @xcite .",
    "@xcite first recognized that off - center helium and carbon ignition would indeed lead to thermohaline mixing below the burning shells but the long ( thermal ) timescale estimated for the growth of this instability compared to the rapid evolution of the shell flash led to a diminished interest in this context . in our shell flash simulations ,",
    "the layers below the shell convection are indeed unstable according to the thermohaline condition ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) but _ the mixing process operating in our simulations is in fact distinct from direct thermohaline mixing _ , since it operates on a significantly shorter timescale than the thermal timescale . instead , we find that _ the regions which undergo mixing are forced by waves excited within the region by the adjacent turbulent convection zone_. therefore , what we have captured in our simulations is a wave induced , turbulent mixing process operating in a stably stratified layer .      as described in  [ sec : general - features ] and  [ sec : linear - stability ] , the regions immediately below the convective shells are initially ( linearly ) dynamically stable .",
    "furthermore , the absence of heat conduction in these simulations precludes these regions from undergoing thermally driven instabilities , such as semiconvection and thermohaline mixing .",
    "therefore , the instabilities which develop in these regions are most naturally attributable to the jostling of the layers by turbulence in the adjacent convection zone .",
    "the nature of the jostling is predominantly in the form of internal wave motions ( i.e. , gravity waves ) .",
    "as the stable layer is jostled by the neighboring convection , mixing is instigated which redistributes the entropy and the composition .",
    "this is illustrated in the time sequence presented in figure  [ fig : mix - sequence - he ] for the helium shell flash model hefl.2d.3 .",
    "there are several notable features in this figure .",
    "first , the convection zone remains separated from the underlying stable layer by a spike in buoyancy frequency @xmath66 ( around r@xmath80  cm in panels @xmath54 and @xmath52 ) arising from the entropy jump between the convection zone and the underlying layer .",
    "this entropy jump is due to the energy deposition by the nuclear burning in the shell .",
    "note that the stabilizing layer is present despite the destabilizing @xmath81profile .",
    "in other words , the entropy profile is stable enough to compensate for the destabilizing @xmath81gradient effect .",
    "the spike in buoyancy also prevents overshoot mixing into the underlying stable layers .",
    "another notable feature is the reduction in stability just below the buoyancy frequency spike which separates the region from the convection zone as time progresses .",
    "this reduction in stability ( or decrease in n@xmath82 ) is associated with a flattening of the entropy profile in the stable layer due to mixing induced in the region .",
    "the mixing that ensues is also associated with a modification of the composition profile , and by @xmath83 seconds a new step in the @xmath49-profile has already formed near @xmath84 cm .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that in addition to the mixing inside the stable layer there is an overall deepening of the convection zone due to turbulent entrainment . by @xmath85 seconds",
    "the convective boundary has migrated inward a distance of @xmath86 cm , from @xmath87 cm to @xmath88 cm .    in the stable layers ,",
    "the mixing is strongest in regions where the gradients are largest , as expected for a diffusive mixing process . since compositional mixing at the molecular level",
    "is not included in these simulations , nor is heat conduction , this mixing results as a consequence of numerical diffusion .",
    "we stress here that the numerical diffusion can have a realistic counterpart in stars , but caution should be paid to the quantitative rate of mixing presented in this paper .",
    "we will discuss the connection between the simulated results ( and numerical mixing ) and the situation in real stars below in terms of wave enhanced diffusion as studied by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a striking phenomena seen in both the he- and c - flash convection models is the formation of homogeneous layers in the mixing region separated by steep gradient interfaces .",
    "these are apparent in both figure  [ fig.caflfing ] and figure  [ fig : mix - sequence - he ] .",
    "once these layers have formed , a subsequent phase of evolution takes place which involves the migration of the interfaces separating these layers .",
    "this is illustrated in the series of snapshots compiled in figure  [ fig.n2 ] , which shows the time evolution of the buoyancy frequency @xmath66 in the mixing region for the carbon flash model .",
    "these @xmath66 profiles and their peaks are seen to evolve by a process of corresponding interface migration driven by turbulent entrainment .",
    "this entrainment is powered by the turbulent kinetic energy deposited in the region by trapped gravity waves which are excited by the overlying convection zone , rather than thermally driven turbulence as in the case of a convection zone .",
    "the formation of steps and interface migration is a well known phenomena in a variety of fluid dynamic systems , including those studied in geophysical systems , in laboratories , and in simulation .",
    "a very close analog to the type of interface migration that we see in our simulations is the situation modeled by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 6 and 13 , which show striking similarities to our figure  [ fig.n2 ] ) . in their work ,",
    "the evolution of buoyancy due to turbulence in a stably stratified layer is modeled in an attempt to understand the origin of layer formation and the dynamics of interface migration .",
    "this situation is a very close analog to the mixing process taking place in our simulations , except that the source of turbulence induced in the mixing region in our calculations is due to wave motions excited in the region .",
    "although the quantitative rate of mixing in these regions remains to be identified through higher resolution calculations and analysis , the formation of steps and their migration through the stable layer provide important clues about how one might treat this mixing in 1d stellar evolution codes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     as a function of radial",
    "coordinate for different values of the time .",
    "the vertical axis is time and the profiles are shown spaced at time intervals of @xmath89 700 seconds .",
    "the inset figure at the top is showing the scale for n@xmath82 corresponding to the last profile at time @xmath89 53000  s. ]",
    "we have identified a mixing process operating in our simulations of off - center helium- and carbon - flash convection .",
    "the mixing results in the redistribution of composition and entropy within the stable layers that reside beneath the shell convection zones . associated with the mixing process is the formation of `` fingers '' of high mean molecular weight material which traverse the mixing region .",
    "these `` fingers '' are essentially tracer of material trasport taking place across the stable layer ( e.g. , figure  [ fig.fingcarb ] ) .",
    "we find that this mixing takes place against a background state which is initially _ dynamically stable _ to linear perturbations . and while the mixing region is indeed unstable to thermohaline mixing on a secular timescale , the mixing process that we observe operates on a _ dynamical timescale _",
    ", thus excluding thermohaline mixing as the root cause .",
    "this is reinforced by the fact that heat conduction was not included in these calculations , primarily because its effects are too slow to operate over the time frames simulated .",
    "the thermal timescale for thermohaline mixing @xcite estimated for our core helium flash model is of the order of @xmath90  years .",
    "it is neither expected that the timescale will drastically change ( decrease ) with improved stellar models nor during the flash as the thermal structures are in general very similar @xcite .",
    "our search for a counterpart to the mixing observed in our simulations among terrestrial experiments with qualitatively similar conditions led us to phenomena like viscous or density fingering driven by a rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite and buoyancy - driven instabilities resulting from differences in mass diffusion coefficients of chemically - reacting species sitting on top of each other @xcite .",
    "properties of these phenomena do not fit the mixing in our simulations .    as an alternative explanation we describe a scenario in which mixing is instigated by the finite amplitude jostling motions of the stable layer by the turbulence present in the adjacent convective shell .",
    "the perturbations induced in the stable layer by the adjacent convection are primarily in the form of waves ( i.e. , g - modes ) .",
    "the jostling of the stable layer results in a diffusive mixing process therein which leads to a redistribution of the entropy and composition on a dynamical timescales .",
    "this scenario is qualitatively similar to the enhanced mixing discussed by @xcite and @xcite who found that thermal and mass transport is not only a function of temperature and composition gradients , but also a function of the fluid shearing motions setup by the presence of a passing wave field .    indeed , the layer from which the mixing begins coincides with layers of strongest shear ( fig.[fig.fingall ]  c ) .",
    "but the shear and the finite amplitude perturbations alone do not drive mixing and have to be preceded by the formation of sufficiently steep compositional gradients . in the case of our core helium and carbon flash models ,",
    "such gradients are inherent in our initial stellar models at the bottom of convection shells due to off - center ignition .",
    "the biggest source of uncertainty inherent in this work is the quantitative rate of mixing .",
    "this uncertainty stems from the fact that the simulated mixing results from enhanced numerical diffusion , rather than from a resolved velocity field and molecular diffusion processes .",
    "higher resolution simulations as well as analytic modeling should be pursued , perhaps in restricted models , in order to quantify the mixing rate due to this process .",
    "this is necessary for including it into a stellar evolution code .",
    "one of the pressing goals for stellar evolution is the construction of algorithms for 1d codes that capture mixing processes such as that described in this paper , and which extend mixing due to hydrodynamic processes beyond the boundaries of convective regions and into stably stratified layers .",
    "the need to treat turbulence and mixing in stable layers has already been recognized in the geophysical community ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
