    "due to the fact that are known just two long - range interactions , the gravitation and electromagnetism , came the idea there could be some relationship between them .",
    "the discovery of this link could help for a better understanding of gravity , especially in the sense of this quantization .",
    "michael faraday in half of nineteenth century , was , apparently , the first to imagine that gravitation and electromagnetism have some relationship to each other . despite his experiments",
    "have been a fundamental importance for the development of electromagnetism , he did not get find any relationship with gravity .",
    "even the negative results of the experiments in this direction the faraday s deep conviction about the existence of this connection was not shaken .",
    "when maxwell published the work in which showed that electric and magnetic phenomena were manifestations of the same field , the electromagnetic , arose the ambition to unify gravity with these phenomena , until then described by newtonian theory .",
    "after the reformulation of gravity by einstein the attempts to unify the long - range interactions have taken a new direction . in 1918 , weyl @xcite published a paper which proposed to modify the connection of general relativity by another in which the electromagnetic field would be contained , in the mathematical point of view meant leaving the riemannian geometry .",
    "another attempt to modify the geometry in order to unify these two interactions was proposed by klein and kaluza , and consisted of maintain the riemannian geometry , but include an extra spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom of gravity in more dimensions , after a dimensional reduction , would fall in the usual gravity and electromagnetism .",
    "einstein himself was convinced that this relationship should exist and devoted the last years of his life to the search of the unified field theory , that is still the subject of countless works @xcite . despite all failed attempts of unification made by great names of science",
    "persists the belief that this connection exists .",
    "historically the attempt to establish an analogy between electromagnetism and gravitation began in 1893 , when heaviside @xcite investigated how the energy propagates in a gravitational field .",
    "he proposed a gravitational poynting vector which contained magnetic components of gravitation . in newton",
    "s theory of gravitation a problem is the absence of freedom of the gravitational field , which is fully defined by a single scalar field , while the electromagnetism by a scalar and a vector field .",
    "we can associate the newtonian gravitational potential to electromagnetic scalar potential , but to proceed with an analogy between both theories we need a vector potential for gravity . in einstein",
    "s theory , the gravitation gains more freedom because now is determined by the 10 independent components of the metric tensor . in general relativity is the gravity who has a lot of freedom in relation to electromagnetism .",
    "another problem raised by the theory of general relativity is that its equations are nonlinear while maxwell s are .",
    "so , to create an analogy between them it is necessary to linearise general relativity and reduce the degrees of freedom of the metric .",
    "forward was the first to write the einstein s equations in a linearised maxwell - type structure , and proposed experiments to detect the gravitomagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "braginski @xcite reached similar equations using the parametrized post - newtonian approximation @xcite , while campbell left in a tensorial form @xcite .",
    "experiments in superconductors was recently proposed by li @xcite following the corrections introduced by ross @xcite and dewitt @xcite in london equation to include the gravitomagnetic fields .    in this paper",
    "we use the post - newtonian approximation one order beyond the newtonian limit in order to define the gravitoelectromagnetic field with independent terms of the metric .",
    "the found equations are used to calculate the effective fields in large scale , considering the matter distributed in local systems .",
    "this systems can be planets orbiting a star or galaxies , depending on the desired scale .",
    "the post - newtonian approximation is satisfactory in these cases since the speed of revolution are much smaller than the light .",
    "the deviation of effective fields is made in an analogous way which was made by russakoff in electromagnetic case @xcite . in this study",
    "we expand the contribution of the bodies bound to local systems in power series in relation to the size of these systems .",
    "finally , we collect the terms analogues to polarization , magnetization and superiors terms , such as quadrupole , to define the effective fields in large scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we make a review about the post - newtonian approximation , in particular the expansion of the metric and the approximate field equations .",
    "we also expand the energy - momentum tensor used in this work and obtain general solutions . in sec .",
    "iii we write the equations in the form of maxwell s equations of electromagnetism , as well as we define the gravitoelectromagnetic field with degrees of freedom of the metric . in sec .",
    "iv we apply the maxwell - einstein s equations for local systems and calculate the promediation of the sources making a multipole expansion in terms of typical lengths of these systems . in sec .",
    "v we define the effective fields in large scale in an analogous way to electromagnetism and write the equations obeyed by these fields . in the last section we discuss the conclusion of this work and present possibles perspectives .",
    "to linearise the einstein s equation we use the post - newtonian approximation , which is a method suitable for objects moving at low speeds compared to the speed of light .",
    "this approach is recommended to the problem we want to study , which is the bodies bounded in solar - type systems .",
    "this is because post - newtonian approximation inserts corrections in newtonian mechanics , and this already sufficiently precise that even situations for sending space probes .",

    "the source of gravitomagnetic field was only the flow of matter , without regard the flow of other forms of energy , whereas the source of the gravitoelectric field take them into account .",
    "in large scale equations that asymmetry was broken , because the source of the field @xmath118 is the same order flow of the source of field @xmath119 .",
    "we show in this paper that it is possible to construct fields with independent elements of the metric in the fourth order post - newtonian approximation , which obey equations similar to maxwell s electromagnetism . through these equations",
    "becomes explicit that not only the matter interacts gravitationally also more energy - in this case the gravitational potential and kinetic energy . due to gauge obeyed by these fields , from fixing coordinates",
    ", the propagation of these fields occurs at the speed of light , which agrees with the spirit of special relativity . despite this progress in building an analogy between both theories ,",
    "it is unable to write the equation of motion in the form of the lorentz equation . with gravitoelectromagnetic fields we found the effective fields for a distribution of matter organized in local systems , as occurs in the universe where matter is organized into bounded structures as solar systems , on a scale , galaxies , on a scale greater .",
    "only after this last level is that we can use a cosmological model , as friedmann , which presupposes matter homogeneously distributed .",
    "the equations for these effective fields , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , exhibited a greater symmetry than the equations of fundamental fields , since their sources satisfy an equation of continuity in the same order , i.e. , the source of field @xmath122 is the flow associated with the source of field @xmath123 .",
    "we show that the definition of these fields are greatly simplified by choosing the coordinate system fixed at the center of mass of local systems , where the terms of dipole vanish . as perspectives to further studies to be made based on the results obtained in this work we can mention the inclusion of the cosmological constant , as well as calculate the corrections of order higher than those considered in this work .",
