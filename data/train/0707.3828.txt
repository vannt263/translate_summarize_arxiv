    "study of finite size clusters is an important means of understanding how magnetic behavior evolves in reduced dimensionality . the 3@xmath3 transition metal ( tm ) elements are characterized by their unfilled @xmath3-shell , which gives rise to their magnetism and many other interesting physical and chemical properties .",
    "early transition metals are nonmagnetic in bulk solids , and only fe , co and ni are known to be ferromagnetic among the 3@xmath3 metals .",
    "however , the small clusters of all the early transition metals are magnetic and those of late transition metals possess magnetic moments enhanced from their bulk values due to their spatial confinement . local spin density based calculation@xcite showed that the face centered cubic ( fcc ) phase is the lowest energy state for bulk co in the paramagnetic phase , whereas the magnetic order stabilizes the hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) phase as the ground state .",
    "this indicates a strong correlation between the stable structure and magnetism .",
    "although , a metastable antiferromagnetic state exists for bulk co , the ferromagnetic state is found to be the most stable for all crystal structures .",
    "this is unlike other 3@xmath3 transition metals cr , mn , and fe which have a stable antiferromagnetic structure in their fcc phase .",
    "this means that not only the crystal structure , but also the electronic configuration controls magnetism . in the present communication ,",
    "we focus on co@xmath0 clusters to understand this interplay",
    ".    the magnetic properties of bare co@xmath0 clusters were first investigated via stern - gerlach ( sg ) molecular beam deflection experiment by bloomfield and co - workers for co@xmath4@xmath2co@xmath5 clusters@xcite and by de heer and co - workers for co@xmath6@xmath2co@xmath7 clusters . @xcite these studies showed that in the temperature range of 77@xmath2300 k , the co@xmath0 clusters display high - field deflections , which are characteristic of superparamagnetic behavior . the superparamagnetic model for free clusters was recently revisited by xu _",
    "et al._@xcite and they proposed that adiabatic magnetization together with avoided zeeman levels crossing in isolated clusters can lead to the same high - field beam deflection behavior as observed in the superparamagnetic spin relaxation .",
    "however , both the models predict the same high temperature limiting form for magnetization as given by the curie law,@xcite @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the cluster magnetic moment , @xmath10 is the magnetic field and @xmath11 is the cluster temperature .",
    "the intrinsic per - atom magnetic moment for small co@xmath0 clusters was found to be substantially larger than the bulk value@xcite and generally decreases with increasing cluster size , eventually reaching the bulk value at @xmath12 500 atoms.@xcite the enhancement in the magnetic moment in small clusters has been attributed to the lower coordination of the surface atoms resulting in a narrowing of the @xmath3-bands and hence greater spin polarization .",
    "information on the ground state geometry of the transition metal clusters is usually obtained from the experiments involving chemical probe methods and photoelectron spectroscopy , though , such studies for the co@xmath0 clusters are very limited and not definitive",
    ". reactions of co@xmath0 clusters with ammonia and water @xcite indicate icosahedral structures for the bare and ammoniated clusters in the size range @xmath1 50@xmath2120 and nonicosahedral packing for small ( around 19 atoms ) co@xmath0 clusters .",
    "although the structures of ammoniated fe@xmath0 , co@xmath0 and ni@xmath0 clusters in the size range of @xmath1 19@xmath234 atoms have been found to be polyicosahedral,@xcite it has been mentioned that the bare clusters probably adopt a variety of structures .",
    "the photoionization experiment,@xcite indicated icosahedral atomic shell structures for large ni@xmath0 and co@xmath0 clusters of 50@xmath2800 atoms .",
    "however , structures were not well identified for small co@xmath0 clusters ( @xmath1350 ) because atomic sub - shell closings in different symmetry based clusters occur in close sequences .",
    "these experimental results put together indicate that the icosahedral growth pattern for small sized co@xmath0 clusters is less evident .",
    "theoretical works on cobalt clusters are limited and the available results are contradictory .",
    "li and gu@xcite performed first - principles calculation of small co@xmath0 clusters ( 4@xmath14@xmath15@xmath1419 ) using spin - polarized discrete variational method within local density functional theory ( dft )",
    ". however , they had not optimized the structures and considered only some special structures with lattice parameters same as the bulk co. guevara _",
    "et al._@xcite used an unrestricted hartree - fock ( hf ) tight - binding formalism , starting from @xmath16-bulk parameterization , but they only considered fixed body - centered cubic ( bcc ) and fcc geometries for a maximum of 177 atoms without structural relaxation .",
    "andriotis and menon@xcite have used a tight - binding molecular dynamics scheme to study cobalt clusters for some selected cluster sizes .",
    "et al._@xcite performed all - electron density functional calculations using both local density and generalized gradient approximations .",
    "however , the size of the clusters were limited only up to 5 atoms .",
    "recently , lopez _",
    "et al._@xcite studied co@xmath0 clusters ( 4@xmath14@xmath15@xmath1460 ) , where minimization was done using an evolutive algorithm based on a many - body gupta potential@xcite and magnetic properties have been studied by a @xmath16 tight - binding method .",
    "as compared to _ ab - initio _ methods , the parameterized tight - binding hamiltonian reduces the computational cost drastically , but its main problem is the lack of transferability of its parameters . in particular , because of the lack of dft like self - consistency the charge transfer effects are not properly accounted for and hence magnetic moment results are not fully reliable .    in this communication ,",
    "we report the first - principles calculation of co@xmath0 clusters ( 2@xmath14@xmath15@xmath1420 ) . without any symmetry constraints",
    ", we simultaneously relax the geometric and magnetic structure to find out the true ground state .",
    "our main interest is to study the evolution of structural , bonding and magnetic properties as a function of cluster size .",
    "we would also point out how the average bond length and coordination number determine the effective hybridization and hence the cluster magnetism .",
    "the calculations are performed using density functional theory , within the pseudopotential plane wave method.@xcite we have used projector augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite and perdew - bruke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite for spin - polarized generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . the 3@xmath3 and",
    "4@xmath17 electrons are treated as valence electrons and the wave functions are expanded in the plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cut - off of 335 ev .",
    "reciprocal space integrations are carried out at the @xmath18 point .",
    "symmetry unrestricted geometry and spin optimizations are performed using conjugate gradient and quasi - newtonian methods until all the force components are less than a threshold value of 0.005 ev/. simple cubic super - cells are used with the periodic boundary conditions , where two neighboring clusters are kept separated by at least 12 vacuum space .",
    "this essentially makes the interaction between the cluster images negligible . for each size",
    ", several initial geometrical structures have been considered . to get the ground state magnetic moment",
    "we have explicitly considered _ all possible _ spin multiplicities for each geometrical structure .",
    "the binding energy per atom is calculated as , @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the size of the cluster .",
    "@xmath20(co ) and @xmath20(co@xmath0 ) are the total energies of isolated co - atom and @xmath15-atom co@xmath0 cluster , respectively . in such a definition ,",
    "a positive sign in @xmath21 corresponds to binding .",
    "both experimental and theoretical predictions of the true ground state of the co@xmath24 dimer are controversial . the first experimental estimation of co@xmath24 dimer bond length and binding energy has been made by mass spectroscopy,@xcite which are 2.31 and 1.72 ev , respectively . however , more recent collision - induced dissociation ( cid ) experiment@xcite has estimated an upper bound of 1.32 ev to the dimer dissociation energy .",
    "the present calculation gives dimer binding energy as 1.45 ev / atom and a bond length of 1.96  , which is 78% of the bulk hcp co. the co atoms in dimer have bonding configuration closer to 3@xmath254@xmath26 than that of the isolated co atom , which is @xmath27 and in addition to the highly delocalized 4@xmath17 electrons , the more localized 3@xmath3 electrons also contribute strongly to the bonding,@xcite which consequently , produces a shorter bond length for the dimer .",
    "compared to the neutral co@xmath24 dimer , the experimentally@xcite predicted that the bonding in co@xmath28 dimer cation is much strong , @xmath12 2.73 @xmath29 0.27 ev , which is formed by combining a neutral co ( @xmath27 ) atom with a co@xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) cation in their respective ground state .",
    "therefore , no promotional energy is required to form the cationic dimer .",
    "in fact , the bonding in co@xmath28 is relatively strong compared with other first - row transition metal dimer cations . on the other hand , the formation of neutral co@xmath24 dimer requires 3@xmath324@xmath33 @xmath34 3@xmath254@xmath26 promotion @xcite for both the co atoms , which is 0.42 ev.@xcite we found that co@xmath24 dimer has a total magnetic moment of 4 @xmath35 , which is also consistent with mass spectroscopic measurement@xcite .",
    "our estimates agree with the previous first - principles calculations.@xcite    in fig.[fig:1to10 ] we show the geometrical structures of co@xmath0 clusters for the ground state and the first isomer for @xmath1210 and the calculated binding energy , relative energy to the ground state and magnetic moment are given in the table [ tab : bemag ] for the entire size range , @xmath1220 .",
    "for co@xmath36 cluster , we have studied both the linear and the triangular structures . an isosceles triangle with total magnetic moment 5 @xmath35",
    "is found to be the ground state with binding energy 1.78 ev / atom .",
    "each of the two equal sides has length of 2.19 and other one has 2.10 length . another isosceles triangle with two long and one short bond lengths of 2.25 and 2.06 ,",
    "respectively , is found to be nearly degenerate with the ground state structure ( energy difference is only 3 mev ) . according to the present calculation ,",
    "the linear structure lies much higher in energy .",
    "the optimal linear structure has a total magnetic moment of 7 @xmath35 and lies 0.43 ev higher than the ground state .",
    "present result is consistent with the spin resonance spectra of co@xmath36 in ar / kr matrix , which indicated a triangular structure with a total moment of 5 or 7 @xmath35 to be the ground state.@xcite the bonding in co@xmath37 cation is stronger than the neutral co@xmath36 as it is the case for dimer.@xcite yoshida _",
    "et al._@xcite reported that co@xmath38 has a linear structure with bond distance of 2.25@xmath22.50 based on their photoelectron spectroscopic study . in agreement ,",
    "previous all - electron ( ae ) density functional calculation@xcite predicted an isosceles triangle ( 2.12 , 2.12 , 2.24  ) with a magnetic moment of 1.7 @xmath35/atom as the ground state for co@xmath36 .",
    "this is also consistent with the tight - binding study,@xcite but they predicted much higher bond lengths and magnetic moment .",
    "three different initial geometries have been considered for co@xmath39 cluster : tetrahedral , rectangular and linear . a distorted tetrahedron with a total magnetic moment of 10 @xmath35 appears to be the most stable structure .",
    "it has 2.27 ev / atom energy and has an average bond length of 2.34  . among the six sides of this tetrahedral ground state , two pairs have equal lengths of 2.14  , while the third pair is much larger , 2.72  .",
    "there is no experimental result available on the structure of neutral tetramer .",
    "however , yoshida _ et al._@xcite predicted a tetrahedral structure with a bond length of 2.25 @xmath29 0.2 as the ground state for co@xmath40 anion .",
    "the initial rectangular structure becomes a rhombus after optimization , which also has 10 @xmath35 magnetic moment and lies 0.11 ev higher in energy from the ground state .",
    "it is the next energetically favorable state , which has sides of length 2.14 and two diagonals of 2.67 and 3.35  .",
    "our results for co@xmath39 are consistent with previous calculations.@xcite castro _ et al._@xcite predicted a strong jahn - teller distorted tetrahedral ground state with bond lengths almost equal to the present values .",
    "the distorted tetrahedral ground state structure is accomplished by a reduction of some inter - atomic distances ( and the enlargement of other bonds ) until some short equilibrium bond lengths result for which there is a more effective participation of the ( short - range ) 3@xmath3-electrons in the bonds .",
    "in fact , in the distorted tetrahedron , there are some bonds ( these are always on opposite tm@xmath2tm sides ) , which have lengths close to that of the dimer .",
    "these short bonds have high 3@xmath3 contributions and they are , therefore , the major source of increase of the bonding in the distorted structure . for both the ground state and the first isomer , the magnetic moment",
    "is found to be 2.5 @xmath35/atom .",
    "the optimal linear structure is at a much higher energy than the ground state .",
    "we took trigonal bi - pyramid , square pyramid and two planar structures : two triangles connected through a vertex and a pentagon as the initial structures for co@xmath41 cluster . the trigonal bi - pyramid with total magnetic moment 13 @xmath35",
    "is found to be the most stable structure .",
    "this structure has 2.55 ev / atom binding energy and 2.34 average bond length . in this ground state ( fig.[fig:1to10 ] ) , there are two types of bond lengths : all the sides of the upper and lower triangular pyramids are of same length and are smaller ( 2.18 ) , while those of the interfacing planar triangle are much larger , 2.65 .",
    "another triangular bi - pyramid and a square pyramid with an equal magnetic moment of 11 @xmath35 are found to be the degenerate first isomer .",
    "they lie 125 mev higher in energy .",
    "the optimal planar pentagon with 11 @xmath35 magnetic moment lies much , 1.04 ev , higher and the double triangle structure lies even higher in energy from the ground state .",
    "present results are in agreement with the previous ae - gga calculation,@xcite where they predicted the same geometric structure with 2.28 average bond length and 2 @xmath35/atom magnetic moment as the ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the prediction@xcite of average bond length and magnetic moment using gupta potential is much higher , though it predicted the same geometry .",
    "we have studied the capped trigonal bi - pyramid , octahedron and pentagonal pyramid to search the ground state for co@xmath42 cluster . from now on for the larger clusters , the planar structures have been discarded by intuition . an octahedral structure with 14 @xmath35 total magnetic moment is found to be the ground state .",
    "an initial capped triangular bi - pyramidal structure relaxes to the octahedral ground state .",
    "each side of this octahedral ground state is about 2.27 and has a binding energy of 2.93 ev / atom .",
    "another slightly distorted octahedron with 12 @xmath35 moment appears as the first isomer .",
    "however , it is 0.87 ev higher compared to the ground state . in the present calculation , the optimal pentagonal pyramid lies much higher ( 1.7 ev ) in energy compared to the ground state and also has 12 @xmath35 magnetic moment .",
    "present result is in agreement with previous theoretical studies,@xcite and the octahedral structure is generally accepted as the most stable structure for co@xmath42 cluster .",
    "however , photoelectron spectroscopic study@xcite predicted a pentagonal pyramid with bond distances @xmath12 2.75 @xmath29 0.1 to be the most probable structure for co@xmath43 anion cluster , i.e. , the geometrical structure might strongly be correlated with the charged state of the cluster .    for co@xmath44 cluster , we considered capped octahedron , pentagonal bi - pyramid and bi - capped triangular bi - pyramid .",
    "after simultaneous relaxation of both geometrical and magnetic structure , the capped octahedron with 15 @xmath35 magnetic moment appears as the most stable structure .",
    "this structure has an average bond length of 2.29 and has 2.97 ev / atom binding energy .",
    "the experimentally measured magnetic moment , 2.36 @xmath29 0.25 @xmath35/atom@xcite , is little higher than our result .",
    "the optimal pentagonal bi - pyramid , which is a building block of icosahedral structure , has a total magnetic moment of 15 @xmath35 , which lies 0.19 ev higher in energy from the ground state .",
    "this is the first isomer and it has an average bond length of 2.32  .",
    "the optimal bi - capped triangular bi - pyramid has a total magnetic moment of 15 @xmath35 and lies 0.42 ev higher .",
    "however , using gupta potential , lopez _ et al._@xcite predicted a pentagonal bi - pyramidal structure as the ground state , and a capped octahedra as the first isomer .",
    "we have studied three different geometries for co@xmath45 cluster : bi - capped octahedron , capped pentagonal bi - pyramid and tri - capped triangular bi - pyramid .",
    "the bi - capped octahedron with 16 @xmath35 magnetic moment is found to be the most stable structure .",

    "a distorted tri - capped octahedron is found to be the most stable structure with 3.14 ev / atom binding energy .",
    "this ground state structure has 17 @xmath35 total magnetic moment , which is smaller than the experimental value of 2.38 @xmath29 0.11 @xmath35/atom.@xcite the optimal bi - capped pentagonal bi - pyramid has 17 @xmath35 magnetic moment and lies 0.53 ev higher in energy .",
    "this structure is found to the first isomer .",
    "the present results are not in good agreement with the semi - empirical predictions,@xcite where they predicted the bi - capped pentagonal bi - pyramid as the ground state with a relatively high magnetic moment .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to understand the optimized structures",
    ", we calculated the average bond lengths and average coordination number for the ground state geometries and plotted them in fig.[fig : blength](a ) and fig.[fig : blength](b ) , respectively , as a function of cluster size .",
    "these two quantities are closely related to the structure of the cluster .",
    "we define the average bond length as @xmath48 = @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the bond distance between the @xmath51-th and @xmath52-th atoms , and @xmath53 is the number of such bonds . here",
    "we consider that two atoms are bonded if their inter atomic distance is within 2.91 , which is around the average of the first ( 2.51 ) and second ( 3.54 ) nearest - neighbor distances in bulk co. the average coordination number in a cluster is defined as @xmath54 = @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of neighbors within the chosen cut - off of the @xmath57-th atom in the cluster of @xmath15 atoms .",
    "the convergence of the average bond length to the bulk value ( 2.51 ) is much faster than the convergence of average coordination , which is far below the bulk value ( 12 for hcp co ) .",
    "dips at @xmath46 6 and 9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : blength](a ) indicate that the atoms in these clusters are closely spaced and strongly bonded compared to the neighbors , and therefore are more stable than the neighboring structures . while the peaks at @xmath1 5 , 10 and 14 in fig.[fig : blength](a ) and at @xmath110 and 14 in fig.[fig : blength](b ) indicate that atoms in these clusters are far apart and slightly more coordinated then their neighbors,@xcite which results in a weak bonding in these clusters compared to their neighbors .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments are plotted in fig.[fig : magmom ] as a function of cluster size ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the co@xmath2co interaction is always ferromagnetic for the entire size range studied , as it is for hcp bulk co. however , the magnetic moment ( 2@xmath22.5 @xmath35/atom ) is larger than the hcp bulk value , 1.72 @xmath35/atom.@xcite this enhancement in moment for a few atom cluster can readily be understood from the more localized @xmath3-electrons resulting from the decrease in effective hybridization .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments are in fair agreement with the very recent sg experiments by xu _ et al._@xcite and knickelbein.@xcite fig.[fig : magmom ] shows a qualitative agreement between the calculated and the experimental values,@xcite though the calculated moments are always underestimated systematically . however , calculated moments are close to that of predicted by xu _",
    "et al._@xcite for the size range @xmath113@xmath217 and in the size range @xmath118@xmath220 they are close to the values predicted by knickelbein.@xcite the underestimation of calculated moment may be due to the fact that we did not include spin - orbit interaction in the present calculation .",
    "moreover , one should remember that the magnetic moments in a magnetic deflection measurement are always derived assuming a model , which may influence the outcome .",
    "for example , knickelbein@xcite used either superparamagnetic or locked moment model , whether xu _",
    "et al._@xcite assumed an adiabatic magnetization model to derive the moments experimentally for cobalt clusters .",
    "it is important to note that both experiments show same size evolution in general but there are some systematic differences .",
    "however , this is not due to the adoption of different models to calculate the magnetic moment as both the models resemble with the same curie law for magnetization,@xcite but may be due to differing isomer distribution in the sg beam .",
    "the magnetic moment is strongly correlated with the effective hybridization , which is closely related to the average bond length @xmath48 and the average coordination number @xmath54 . as @xmath54 decreases the magnetic moment should increase through the decrease in effective hybridization .",
    "on the other hand , the dependency of magnetic moment on @xmath48 is directly proportional : a decrease in @xmath48 results in decrease in magnetic moment through the enhancement in effective bonding .",
    "fig.[fig : blength](a ) and fig.[fig : blength](b ) show that as we go from @xmath1 4 to @xmath1 10 , both @xmath48 and @xmath54 increase , whereas fig.[fig : magmom ] shows that the magnetic moment per atom decreases .",
    "therefore , between these two competing contributions ( @xmath48 and @xmath54 ) to the magnetic moment , the average coordination number dominates over the average bond length in the size range @xmath14@xmath210 .    in the intermediate size range , @xmath1 11@xmath220 ,",
    "the variation of @xmath48 ( fig.[fig : blength]a ) and @xmath54 ( fig.[fig : blength]b ) is much slower with @xmath15 , and therefore , the magnetic moment per atom does not vary rapidly .",
    "it is around 2 @xmath35/atom for all the clusters in this size range .",
    "so , in this size range , it is hard to predict the dominant parameter for magnetism . to illustrate the effect of @xmath48 and @xmath54 on the magnetism in the intermediate size range we compare these two quantities for the optimal hcp and icosahedral structures ( see insets ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.[fig : comp ] ) .",
    "it is seen that for a hcp structure , both the @xmath48 and @xmath54 are smaller than those of corresponding icosahedral structure for a particular @xmath15-atom cluster .",
    "in addition the magnetic moments of optimal hcp clusters are always larger than or equal to that of the corresponding optimal icosahedral clusters ( see fig.[fig : comp ] ) , which again demonstrates that in this intermediate size range also the coordination dominates over the average bond length in deciding magnetism .",
    "we have systematically studied the structure , bonding and magnetism in co@xmath0 clusters in the size range @xmath12@xmath220 . in the intermediate size range ,",
    "the clusters adopt hcp structural packing , which is different from the trend observed for the other 3@xmath3 transition metal clusters.@xcite in the size range @xmath115@xmath220 , the energy difference between the hexagonal minimum energy states and optimal icosahedral structures increases with cluster size making the icosahedral structures more and more unfavorable with increasing size .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments are in good agreement with both the recent sg experiments .",
    "it is found that the effect of average coordination number always dominates over the average bond length to determine the effective hybridization and therefore , the magnetic moment of the clusters .",
