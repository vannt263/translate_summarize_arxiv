    "nuclear modifications in the physics of partonic degrees of freedom arise either due to the environment in the initial nuclei around the incoming parton or from the interaction with the partonic matter created in the final state of a nuclear collision .",
    "coherent quantum effects may connect and mix initial and final state phenomena . here",
    "we investigate _cold nuclear effects_ defined as effects that do not originate in connection with the thermalized partonic matter in collisions between two heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "cold nuclear effects are usually described as modifications of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) into nuclear parton distributions ( npdf ) . at sufficiently small momentum fraction ,",
    "this has been referred to as nuclear shadowing , but further effects , like nuclear multiple scattering , emc , higher - twist effects , etc . need to be included in a more complete description . in this short review",
    "we present the high-@xmath6 and high-@xmath7 behavior of some of these modifications , using shadowing / nuclear pdf parameterizations by hijing  @xcite , eks  @xcite , eps08  @xcite , and hkn  @xcite .    at present ,",
    "cold nuclear modifications can be tested by experimental data at rhic energies on hadron spectra from @xmath8 collisions , or by direct photon spectra from @xmath8 or @xmath9 collisions , which are essentially not influenced by non - abelian jet energy loss .",
    "note that recent theoretical studies point out the possibility of a small energy loss in @xmath10 or @xmath11 type collisions  @xcite .",
    "we calculated the nuclear modifications at rhic energies up to @xmath12 gev / c using various shadowing parameterizations in our pqcd improved parton model  @xcite .",
    "results are compared to the preliminary phenix data up to the highest measured momenta ( @xmath13 gev / c )  @xcite . on the left side of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , @xmath14 is plotted for neutral pions at @xmath15 @xmath16gev against a logarithmic @xmath6 scale , using the hijing , eks , eps08 , and hkn parameterizations . the hijing shadowing is understood with its accompanying multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "all calculated @xmath14 curves have an approximately linear dependence on @xmath17 in most of the emc region ( @xmath18 gev / c @xmath19 gev / c ) .",
    "thus , we used a simple linear function of @xmath17 to get the slope parameter @xmath20 : @xmath21 the slope @xmath20 is plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we use the best - fitted linear curve in the above @xmath6 interval to compare the calculated slopes to the ones extracted from the data .",
    "the slopes of the model curves are quite similar , although they are smaller ( in absolute value ) than the measured quantities . this may be due to final state effects  @xcite or isospin effects  @xcite .",
    "in addition to pion production slopes in @xmath8 collisions , direct photon production in both @xmath8 and @xmath9 collisions is plotted .",
    "our results are compared to the preliminary phenix data  @xcite .",
    "these data have decreasing tendencies with @xmath6 , leading to negative @xmath20 values similar to those in @xmath22 production . in the case of the @xmath8 photon data ,",
    "the large error bars manifest themselves in a large uncertainty of the extracted slope .",
    "direct @xmath23 production in @xmath9 shows a stronger decrease , since the initial state nuclear effects enter the convolution integral twice in this case .",
    "we analyzed the theoretical uncertainties in our model  @xcite .",
    "we found that at @xmath24 gev / c our model is not sensitive to the scale choice .",
    "nuclear pdf parameterizations vary both the position of the cronin peak and the high-@xmath6 slope of @xmath2 .",
    "the hkn parameterization allowed us to analyze the errors via the hessian method  @xcite .",
    "an almost constant @xmath25 uncertainty was found in the whole transverse momentum range .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that the eps08 and hkn npdf parameterizations give slopes close to the experimental ones .",
    "however , hkn comes closer to the measured points at high @xmath6 ( see the left panel ) .",
    "note that the agreement with the data can be improved by the introduction of a small opacity , as we have done in ref .",
    "based on ref.s  @xcite we estimated the cold nuclear modifications at lhc energies with larger intrinsic transverse momenta .",
    "we apply the same parameterizations used above . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we plot @xmath26 in @xmath27 collisions at midrapidity at rhic and lhc energies as functions of transverse momentum fraction , @xmath28 .",
    "the preliminary phenix @xmath8 data on neutral pion production are also shown .",
    "the different panels display different shadowing parameterizations as noted on fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "though at rhic energies all parameterization give similar results , at lhc we see that at @xmath29 hijing yields a strong ( @xmath30 ) suppression , while hkn gives a @xmath31 enhancement at the same @xmath7 values .",
    "the eks and eps08 results predict a @xmath32 enhancement ( suppression ) around @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the eps08 results show somewhat stronger suppression than eks at low @xmath7 , due to the inclusion of high - rapidity rhic data in the fitting procedure of this recent parameterization . for the high momentum - fraction region",
    "both of these models show a similar behavior due to the emc effect .",
    "hijing and hkn have a reasonable agreement between rhic and lhc energies ( they scale with @xmath7 ) , while eks and especially eps08 display less precise scaling at around the anti - shadowing maximum .",
    "finally we turn to possible cold energy loss at the lhc .",
    "the standard estimate is @xmath35 in central @xmath36 collisions at lhc energies  @xcite . while in central @xmath27 collisions",
    "the geometrical cross section is small , using @xmath37 from  @xcite one obtains @xmath38 , still large , in central @xmath27 collisions .",
    "this motivates us to examine the effect of a small energy loss in the final state .",
    "we apply opacity values @xmath39 for this illustration .",
    "the results are indicated as thin dotted ( @xmath40 ) and dot - dashed ( @xmath41 ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    the energy loss is stronger at the lower @xmath7 values . here",
    "the relative particle yield is suppressed , and @xmath42 is steeper . in the high @xmath6 region",
    "the suppression loses strength as it increases with @xmath43 .",
    "we tested this effect at rhic and lhc energies in @xmath9 ( @xmath36 ) collisions  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the high transverse - momentum behavior of the nuclear modifications in @xmath11 collisions . using preliminary phenix data we checked several common nuclear shadowing parameterizations .",
    "we compared the logarithmic slopes of the nuclear modification factor in the @xmath18 gev / c @xmath19 gev / c region .",
    "the shadowing parameterizations investigated have an almost linear behavior with a negative slope in @xmath8 collisions at rhic , which can be attributed to the emc effect . while we found all studied shadowing models reliable at intermediate @xmath6 , at high transverse momenta",
    "the eps08 and the hkn nuclear pdf seem to give the best agreement with the phenix data .",
    "we tested the @xmath7 scaling of midrapidity @xmath22 production in @xmath11 collisions at rhic and lhc energies in the models . at high",
    "@xmath7 most models have a similar behavior , but eps08 deviates from precise scaling around @xmath44 . at lower @xmath7 , @xmath42 shows a @xmath45 enhancement in the hkn , eks , and eps08 models .",
    "the enhancement is absent in the hijing with multiscattering model .",
    "we tested the effect of a small energy loss , which counteracts any enhancement in @xmath27 collisions and yields a wide - range suppression of the @xmath42 . in light of these results and open questions ,",
    "we emphasize the need for @xmath46 ( or at least @xmath27 ) measurements at the lhc .",
