    "the choice of the sequence  @xmath374 , @xmath375 ,   of polynomials which we use to define our matrices is essential .",
    "a bad choice here can lead to numerical instability that might prevent us from solving the problem .",
    "in particular , we have observed that the monomial basis performs specially badly .",
    "a much better choice are normalized laguerre polynomials , as had been observed in a similar setting by de laat , oliveira , and vallentin  @xcite .",
    "namely , we set @xmath476 where  @xmath477 is the absolute value of the coefficient of  @xmath478 with largest absolute value .    also essential to the stability of problem  a",
    "is the choice of the basis used to express polynomial identity  .",
    "again , the monomial basis is a poor choice .",
    "instead we use the basis @xmath479 for  @xmath324 ,  ,  @xmath246 and @xmath480 such that @xmath481 .",
    "this means that in order to express constraint  , we expand the corresponding polynomial in the above basis , and then require each coefficient of the expansion to be zero .    in preliminary tests with reasonably dense samples for constraint  , we observed that most variables in problem  a did not seem to play a role , at least for the values of  @xmath246 and  @xmath404 that we considered .",
    "so we decided to discard all variable matrices except for @xmath482 and we observed that this did not have much effect on the optimal value of the problem , while providing for simpler and more stable problems . from now on , when we refer to problem  a it should be understood that we only use the variables listed above .",
    "we now have a complete description of the semidefinite programming problem to be solved , let us sketch how we obtained the bound of  @xmath32 for the pentagon packing density .",
    "we first solve problem  a ( with less variables , as explained above ) for  @xmath483 and  @xmath484 , using a sample with  537 points .",
    "this sample we pick as follows .",
    "we first pick  @xmath11 uniformly spaced values for  @xmath314 in  @xmath485 $ ] , starting with  @xmath486 and ending with  @xmath423 . for each such value of  @xmath314 ,",
    "we pick in the square  @xmath487 ^ 2 $ ] a uniformly spaced grid of  @xmath488 points , and add to the sample all triples  @xmath339 , where  @xmath489 corresponds to a grid point outside of the minkowski difference  @xmath490 and such that  @xmath491 .",
    "moreover , the symmetry of  @xmath1 allows us to restrict our sample considerably  figure  [ fig : sample ] has an example .    .",
    "each facet  @xmath284 of the minkowski difference defines a line  @xmath492 , its supporting hyperplane , and for the sample we would then pick all points in the grid that are inside the circle of radius  @xmath3 and that lie , for some facet  @xmath284 of the minkowski difference , on the side of  @xmath492 that does not contain the origin . since we work with @xmath194-invariant functions , however , we need not choose all these points : it suffices to consider only two adjacent facets of the minkowski difference , instead of all the facets . ]",
    "we observed , by evaluating the function  @xmath51 obtained via this approach , that this small sample is already enough to enforce condition  ( ii ) of theorem  [ thm : main ] on most of the required domain . to really obtain a function  @xmath51 satisfying the conditions of theorem  [ thm : main ] , however , we have to work a bit more .",
    "since we use a numerical solver for semidefinite programming , the solutions we obtain for problem  a are not really feasible , but almost feasible .",
    "so we can not be _ a priori _ certain that the bound given by problem  a is really an upper bound .    to deal with this issue",
    ", we use the same approach outlined by de laat , oliveira , and vallentin  @xcite , which we briefly explain here .",
    "first , we solve problem  a in order to get an estimate of its optimal value ; say  @xmath493 is the numerical optimal value obtained .",
    "then , we solve a version of problem  a in which the objective function is removed but a constraint @xmath494 is added .    this problem is a feasibility problem , and for this reason the solver will return a solution that is strictly feasible , i.e. , a solution in which the solution matrices are _ positive definite _ , if one can be found .    in this way",
    ", we manage to obtain a solution of problem  a having objective value close to what the optimal value is supposed to be , in which each matrix has a minimum eigenvalue around  @xmath495 , whereas the constraints are satisfied up to an absolute error of  @xmath496 . by projecting",
    "the solution obtained onto the affine subspace generated by constraints  , , , and  , using double - precision floating - point arithmetic , we manage to drop the absolute error to  @xmath497 , while not changing much the minimum eigenvalues of the solution matrices .",
    "so the approach detailed by de laat , oliveira , and vallentin  @xcite applies .",
    "namely , since the minimum eigenvalues of the solution matrices are big compared to the absolute errors , we may be sure that by changing the solution matrices slightly , we may ensure that the constraints are satisfied , thus obtaining a truly feasible solution , without significantly changing the objective value .",
    "notice that we do not need to carry out this change in practice , it suffices to know that it can be done .",
    "finally , we still have to show that the function  @xmath51 thus obtained satisfies condition  ( ii ) of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "we have said that  @xmath51 satisfies condition  ( ii ) for most of the points on the required domain .",
    "for instance , since we have constraint  , we know that  @xmath455 for all  @xmath439 .",
    "there are , however , points  @xmath498 with  @xmath459 for which we have  @xmath499 positive , while  ( ii ) would require this value to be nonpositive .",
    "though  @xmath51 does not satisfy condition  ( ii ) of theorem  [ thm : main ] for the pentagon  @xmath1 , it satisfies this condition once we enlarge  @xmath1 slightly . indeed ,  @xmath51 satisfies condition  ( ii ) for the pentagon  @xmath500 .",
    "this we may verify by picking a fine enough sample of points  @xmath339 with  @xmath459 for which  @xmath51 has to be nonpositive , and computing the minimum value of  @xmath51 on this sample using 256-bit - precision floating - point . by computing the derivatives of  @xmath51",
    ", we may estimate how fine the sample has to be and how large the absolute value of the minimum of  @xmath51 on the sample has to be , in order for us to be sure that  @xmath51 is nonpositive in the whole required region .",
    "a side effect of our restriction of the variables is that the function  @xmath51 we obtain is by construction such that @xmath501 for all integer  @xmath383 ( cf .  ) .",
    "this and the symmetry of  @xmath1 helps us restrict the sample to points  @xmath462 with  @xmath502 $ ] . to obtain our bound",
    ", we had to use a sample of about 6.5  million points to check that  @xmath51 satisfies condition  ( ii ) of theorem  [ thm : main ] .    enlarging the body  @xmath1 worsens",
    "the bound given by theorem  [ thm : main ] , but since we consider a small enlargement of  @xmath1 , we still manage to obtain the bound of  @xmath32 .",
    "finally , we mention some of the computational tools used to generate the semidefinite programming problem and solve it . to generate the problem",
    ", we use a c++ program with a custom - made c++ library for generating semidefinite programming problems , in particular dealing with sums of squares constraints . as a solver we used csdp  @xcite , and to analyze the resulting solution and check that it is feasible we used a mix of sage  @xcite and c++ .",
