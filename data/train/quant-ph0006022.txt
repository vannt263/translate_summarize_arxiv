    "<S> part.@xmath39    a note here is that the @xmath40 used above is _ not _ an eigenvector to @xmath41 as used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison shows that using the best possible @xmath40 at a given @xmath23 gives a violation about 80% of the violation from the eigenvector @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we then would have @xmath53 a lower bound can not be obtained ; we have proved the _ only if _ part .    </S>",

    "<S> given @xmath32 , and using @xmath33 , the quantum state ( see @xcite ) , @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is a normalization constant ) , and the rotation @xmath56 yields @xmath57 that is , ( [ eq : nbound ] ) reduces to @xmath58 so when @xmath59 , there exists a quantum state that will give a violation of the ch inequality.@xmath39    this @xmath40 is in a similar fashion as in theorem  2 not an eigenstate , and a check in the three - site case shows that the the violation from the best @xmath40 is just below 70% of that obtained from the eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the computational effort required for these comparisons increases rapidly with the number of sites .    to conclude , we have seen that in the two - site ch inequality , quantum mechanics yields a violation only if @xmath38 , and thus , by the result in @xcite , the lowest bound we can obtain in _ any _ bell inequality for two sites and two detector settings is @xmath2 . for @xmath0-site situations </S>",
    "<S> the picture is not so clear , because of the lack of similar results .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be said that although the current paper yields low bounds on efficiency , these bounds are only proven here for 100% visibility . while the inequalities are valid irrespective of visibility , extra background events will reduce , and then prevent , a violation of the inequality . </S>",
    "<S> the usable visibility depends on the absolute size of the violation of the inequalities ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that lowering the bounds on @xmath23 puts higher demand on the visibility . in general , </S>",
    "<S> the same behavior is to be expected in an @xmath0-particle setup .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the best bound possible to obtain from the @xmath0-particle ch inequalities presented here is that when @xmath61 there is a quantum state yielding a violation in the corresponding @xmath0-particle experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to state    _ theorem 5 : ( a bound on @xmath23 ) _ whenever @xmath62 there exists an @xmath0 and an @xmath63 , so that the @xmath0-particle quantum state @xmath40 given above violates the corresponding @xmath0-particle ch inequality .    or in other words , there are experiments for which the quantum - mechanical predictions violate local realism whenever the efficiency exceeds @xmath3 . </S>"
