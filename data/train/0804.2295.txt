    "<S> therefore , a severe constraint , @xmath8 has been provided  @xcite . for reference </S>",
    "<S> , we here list another data on the ratio  @xcite , @xmath9 eq .  ( [ eq : d_s^*-constraint ] ) implies that the isospin non - conserving interaction is much weaker than the electromagnetic interaction . with this in mind , it is learned , from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> therefore , @xmath0 should be an isospin @xmath10 state which can not be realized by the conventional @xmath11 but can be realized by a tetra - quark meson , @xmath1[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=1}$ ] with @xmath12 . </S>",

    "<S> charm - strange scalar mesons which are degenerate with @xmath0 have been observed in @xmath3 decays  @xcite . in particular , some indications of existence of a charm - strange scalar meson have been observed in the radiative channel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite different from the above @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the charm - strange scalar mesons observed in @xmath3 decays are denoted by @xmath15 $ ] to distinguish it from the above @xmath0 , although @xmath16 $ ] will be identified with @xmath0 later </S>",
    "<S> .    regarding charmed non - strange scalar mesons , a broad enhancement ( @xmath17 ) just below the tensor @xmath18 in @xmath19 mass distribution has been observed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its mass and width are now compiled as  @xcite @xmath20 to check if @xmath17 can be interpreted as the scalar @xmath21 meson , we here study two - body decays of @xmath22 ( and its strange partner @xmath23 ) by using a hard pion ( or kaon ) technique in the infinite momentum frame  @xcite , which is an innovation of the old current algebra . </S>",
    "<S> ( for the technical details in this article , see references quoted . ) in this approximation , the amplitude is given by _ </S>",
    "<S> asymptotic _ </S>",
    "<S> matrix element(s ) ( matrix element(s ) taken between single hadron states with infinite momentum ) of the axial charge @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , we use asymptotic flavor symmetry ( flavor symmetry of asymptotic matrix elements ) which is a prescription to treat broken flavor symmetry  @xcite . comparing @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the experimentally known @xmath26  @xcite which is assigned to the scalar @xmath27  @xcite , and using asymptotic @xmath28 symmetry  @xcite , we estimate rates for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 decays , where the spatial wavefunction overlap is still in the @xmath31 symmetry limit at this stage . correcting its deviation ( reducing the overlap in open - charm meson decays by @xmath32 % when they are compared with those for light - meson decays  @xcite ) from the @xmath31 symmetry limit , we obtain @xmath33 mev and @xmath34 mev , where the mass of @xmath23 has been estimated to be @xmath35 gev by using a quark counting with @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 gev in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_0 ] ) as the input data . because the above rates saturate approximately the full widths of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , their estimated widths  @xcite are @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the above @xmath40 is much smaller than @xmath41 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect that @xmath17 has a structure including @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> four - quark mesons can be classified into the following four groups  @xcite , @xmath42[\\bar q\\bar q ] \\oplus ( qq)(\\bar q\\bar q )    \\oplus \\{(qq)[\\bar q\\bar q ] \\pm [ qq](\\bar q\\bar q)\\ }                                                      \\label{eq:4-quark}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 , where parentheses and square brackets denote symmetry and anti - symmetry of flavor wavefunction , respectively , under exchange of flavors between them . </S>",
    "<S> each term on the right - hand - side ( r.h.s . ) of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4-quark ] ) is again classified into two classes with @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the color @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> . however , these two states can largely mix with each other in the light tetra - quark mesons while , in the corresponding open - charm mesons , such a mixing would be much smaller , because qcd is non - perturbative at the energy scale of the light meson mass while ( rather ) perturbative at the energy scale of the open - charm meson mass . </S>",
    "<S> anyway , we here concentrate on the @xmath47[\\bar q\\bar q]$ ] mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the observed mass hierarchy of low lying scalar nonet mesons , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50  @xcite and @xmath51  @xcite , and the approximate degeneracy between @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be easily understood by assigning them to the @xmath47[\\bar q\\bar q]$ ] mesons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> extension of the above @xmath47[\\bar q\\bar q]$ ] mesons to open - charm mesons is straightforward : @xmath52[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=1}$ ] and @xmath14[\\bar s\\bar n]_{i=0}$ ] with @xmath53 ; @xmath54[\\bar u\\bar d]$ ] and @xmath55[\\bar n\\bar s]$ ] with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; @xmath58[\\bar u\\bar d]$ ] with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be noted that their color configuration would be very much different from that of the light four - quark mesons , i.e. , the former would be dominantly @xmath60 because of the attractive force between two quarks ( and two antiquarks )  @xcite . with this in mind , </S>",
    "<S> we assign @xmath61 to @xmath62  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the other members are estimated very crudely as @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 gev , by using the above quark counting and taking @xmath66 mev as the input data . </S>",
    "<S> the observed narrow width of @xmath61 can be understood by a small rate for its dominant decay . </S>",
    "<S> it can be understood by a small overlap of color and spin wavefunctions which can be seen by decomposing the four - quark state into a sum of products of quark - antiquark pairs  @xcite . to see numerically the narrow width </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the @xmath67 decay with the @xmath68 , where @xmath48 has been assigned to @xmath69[\\bar n\\bar s]_{i=1}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should be careful when we compare decays with different energy scales , in particular , the decays of open - charm scalar mesons with those of the light scalar mesons . using the hard pion technique with the asymptotic @xmath31 symmetry  @xcite , taking  @xcite @xmath70 describing the overlap of color and spin wavefunctions in the open - charm meson decays and @xmath71 mev  @xcite as the input data , and correcting the @xmath31 symmetry breaking , we obtain  </S>",

    "<S> the asymptotic @xmath31 symmetry lead  @xcite to the rates listed in table  ii , where the @xmath31 symmetry breaking has been corrected . </S>",
    "<S> they are much smaller than the rates for the radiative decays of the corresponding parents , as expected intuitively . from the rates in  table  i and table  ii , we obtain @xmath107 which reproduces well eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_s^*-constraint ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the present approach is sufficiently reliable . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> our results on @xmath108 and @xmath109 are much larger than the experimental upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , assigning @xmath0 to @xmath90 or @xmath23 should be excluded .    independently of the above discussions </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath110 has been studied by assigning @xmath0 to @xmath23 ( or the chiral partner of @xmath111 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although some of them  @xcite provided values of @xmath109 smaller than unity in contrary to our intuitive and numerical discussions , these results are still beyond the experimental upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> the other results  @xcite are close to the upper bound of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : constraint - d_s ] ) or satisfy it . </S>",
    "<S> however , these theories have taken a large @xmath112-quark mass which is incompatible with the heavy @xmath113-quark picture and a large @xmath114 which leads to a huge @xmath40 beyond @xmath41 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d_0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining model is a unitarized one  @xcite in which @xmath0 is assigned to a @xmath115 molecule . in this case , the mechanism to cause the isospin non - conservation is more complicated than the usual one , and the results are strongly dependent on the values of parameters involved . in this model , however , the charm - strange axial - vector meson @xmath116 is interpreted as a @xmath117 molecule  @xcite , and its ratio @xmath118 of decay rates corresponding to @xmath110 has been postdicted to be @xmath119 which is much smaller than the measured  @xcite @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , all the assignments of @xmath0 to an iso - singlet state should be ruled out .     </S>",

    "<S> productions of @xmath123 and @xmath124 through @xmath121 and @xmath122 decays are described by the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> , width=529 ]    as seen above , @xmath0 has been successfully assigned to the iso - triplet four - quark meson @xmath62 while the other assignments have been ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , its neutral and doubly charged partners , @xmath124 and @xmath123 , should exist . </S>",
    "<S> however , they have not yet been observed in inclusive @xmath2 annihilation experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it does not necessarily mean their non - existence , because whether they can be observed or not depends on their production mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> with this in mind , we study productions of @xmath125 and @xmath90 mesons , and discuss why inclusive @xmath2 annihilation experiments  @xcite have observed @xmath0 but did not observe its neutral and doubly charged partners . to study productions of scalar @xmath126[\\bar s\\bar n]$ ] mesons in @xmath2 annihilation and @xmath3 decays , we draw quark - line diagrams within the minimal @xmath127 pair creation  @xcite , because multi-@xmath127 pair creation would be suppressed due to the ozi rule . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram ( a ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 depicts a most probable production of @xmath62 ( and a suppression of @xmath90 production because of a small @xmath128 coupling ) in the @xmath129 annihilation , and the diagrams ( b ) and ( e ) describe their productions through @xmath121 and @xmath122 decays . </S>",
    "<S> if the production of charm - strange tetra - quark mesons described by the diagram ( a ) is the main mechanism in the @xmath129 annihilation , the @xmath124 and @xmath123 production will be strongly suppressed , because there is no diagram describing their production . on the other hand , @xmath62 has been observed in the @xmath130 and @xmath131 decays , which are depicted by the diagrams ( b ) and ( e ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> productions of @xmath123 and @xmath124 are expected in the decay @xmath132 as seen in the diagram ( c ) and in the decay @xmath133 as seen in the diagram ( d ) , respectively , where the diagrams ( c ) and ( d ) are equivalent to ( b ) and ( e ) , respectively , under the isospin symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , their production rates are expected to be not very far from those of @xmath134 , and hence the branching fractions for @xmath123 and @xmath135 productions can be estimated as  @xcite @xmath136)_{\\rm babar } = ( 1.0\\pm 0.3\\pm 0.1^{+0.4}_{-0.2})\\times 10^{-3}$ ] , @xmath137)_{\\rm babar }   = ( 1.8\\pm 0.4\\pm 0.3^{+0.6}_{-0.4})\\times 10^{-3}$ ] , where the last equalities have been taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have studied co - existence of the open - charm conventional and tetra - quark scalar mesons . as for the former , </S>",
    "<S> the estimated widths are @xmath138 mev and @xmath139 mev which is much narrower than that of the measured broad @xmath19 enhancement .    </S>",
    "<S> because the observed scalar nonet mesons , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , can be well understood by the @xmath47[\\bar q\\bar q]$ ] mesons , they have been extended to open - charm system , and @xmath0 has been successfully assigned to @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been discussed that all the members of the scalar @xmath73[\\bar q\\bar q]$ ] mesons are narrow . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is awaited that experiments re - analyze more precisely the observed enhancement ( @xmath17 ) just below @xmath18 in the @xmath19 mass distribution , and find its structure including @xmath22 and @xmath140 .    </S>",
    "<S> next , it has been demonstrated that the ratio of the decay rates , @xmath141 , satisfies well the experimental constraint , while @xmath108 and @xmath109 are far beyond the experimental upper bound . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , it has been concluded that @xmath0 should be assigned to @xmath62 but its assignments to @xmath23 and @xmath90 should be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> the other existing theories which have postdicted @xmath110 are critically reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> the above discussion implies that @xmath124 and @xmath123 should exist . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that @xmath3 decays would be better to search for @xmath124 and @xmath123 than inclusive @xmath129 annihilation , and their production rates are expected to be @xmath142 . it is awaited that experiments will confirm co - existence of the conventional and tetra - quark mesons in near future . </S>"
