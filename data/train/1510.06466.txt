    "following the definition of entanglement as a resource for non - local tasks , as a consequence being quantified  @xcite , the time evolution of this quantity was the subject of intense interest .",
    "typically a composite system will lose its entanglement whenever its parts interact with an environment .",
    "it is of great interest then for practical implementations of quantum information protocols , that require entanglement , to understand how the amount of entanglement behaves in time  @xcite .",
    "one characteristic of entanglement dynamics that drew a lot of attention was the possibility of an initially entangled state to lose all its entanglement in a finite time , instead of asymptotically .",
    "the phenomenon was initially called `` entanglement sudden death ''",
    "@xcite , or finite time disentanglement ( ftd ) .",
    "the simplest explanation for this fact is essentially topological : for finite dimensional hilbert spaces , the set @xmath0 of separable states , where entanglement is null , has non - empty interior , _ i.e. _ , there are `` balls '' entirely consisted of separable states .",
    "therefore , whenever an initially entangled state approaches a separable state in the interior of @xmath0 , and given that the dynamics of the state is continuous , it must spend at least a finite amount of time inside the set , so entanglement will be null during this time interval  @xcite .    in references",
    "@xcite , the authors explored how typical the phenomenon is ( for several paradigmatic dynamics of two qubits and two harmonic oscillators ) when one varies the initial states for a fixed dynamics . here",
    "we shall explore how typical it is with respect to the dynamics themselves .",
    "more explicitly , given a dynamics for a composite system , should one expect to find some initially entangled state exhibiting ftd ? here",
    "we argue that the answer is generally positive .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ ftd ]",
    "we discuss about the generic existence of ftd and illustrate this discussion with a well - known example of a family of maps . in section  [ tech ]",
    "we go to the technical lemmas and theorems already used on section  [ ftd ] .",
    "we close this work with section  [ disc ] , discussing further questions and open problems .",
    "in a very broad sense , we can think a _ ( continuous time ) quantum dynamical system _ as given by a family of completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) maps @xmath1 , parametrized by the real time variable @xmath2 for , say , @xmath3 . if a quantum system is in some state given by a density operator @xmath4 at @xmath5 , for any @xmath6 we have the system at the quantum state @xmath7 .",
    "of course , one must have @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the identity map .",
    "although in some cases a discontinuous family of maps can be a good approximation to describe a process ( for example , when a very fast operation is performed on a system , or when the system will not be accessed during some time interval ) , strictly speaking the family of maps should be at least continuous .",
    "generally speaking , fixed some dynamics @xmath1 , we say that it shows _ finite time disentanglement _ ( ftd ) if there exists an entangled state @xmath10 and a time interval @xmath11 , with @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is a separable state for all @xmath14 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors point out that the occurrence of such effect is a natural consequence of the set of separable states @xmath0 having a non - empty interior . indeed ,",
    "if an initially entangled state is mapped at some time @xmath15 to a state in the interior of @xmath0 , given the dynamics continuity , it must spend some finite time inside @xmath16 to reach that state . during that time interval entanglement",
    "is null , although initially the system had some entanglement .",
    "we shall formally state this fact for future reference :    if a bipartite quantum dynamical system is such that , for some @xmath17 , there exists an initially entangled state @xmath18 where its evolved state at time @xmath15 is in the interior of the separable states , there is ftd.[fact ]    this proposition is one of the main reasons of why we believe the following general conjecture is valid :    given a bipartite quantum dynamical system with finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath19 and a continuous family of cptp maps @xmath1 , there is no finite time disentanglement if , and only if , for all @xmath20 there exists unitary operations @xmath21 and @xmath22 acting on @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , such that @xmath25 . [ conjecture ]    in physical terms , this says that ftd do not takes place only in the extremely special situation where the pair of systems is closed ( or at most interacting with a classical external field ) _ and _ non - interacting .",
    "that is , whatever interaction they may have , with each other _ or _ with a third quantum system ( such as a reservoir ) , ftd takes place for some entangled state . from now on ,",
    "we denote the family of dynamics contained in conjecture  [ conjecture ] by @xmath26 , that is : @xmath27    once again , the intuition behind conjecture [ conjecture ] is geometrical .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a pictorial representation of the set of quantum states when the hilbert space is finite dimensional , with the distinguishing property of the set of separable states having non - empty interior . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "the arrows indicates the mapping of initial states to their corresponding evolved ones , on an instant of time @xmath17 .",
    "note that all cptp maps must have at least one fixed point , and all other states can not increase their distance to that fixed one , therefore for each instant of time @xmath3 we can identify a `` direction '' for the flow of states .",
    "it is expected that if the flow is directed towards a separable state , some entangled states will be mapped inside the separable set ( [ fig2]a ) .",
    "but even in the case where the flow is directed towards an entangled one , if the displacement is small enough , some entangled state located `` behind '' the set of separable states will be mapped inside it ( [ fig2]b ) .",
    "below we prove this statement under some special conditions .",
    "we start with the additional assumption that the bipartite system dynamics is induced by unitary operations for all @xmath20 [ there is some @xmath28 acting on @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "that is , the pair of systems may have any interaction with each other and they can even interact with classical external sources ( for instance , their hamiltonian may vary in time due to an external control of some of its parameters ) . under such conditions",
    ", ftd is a consequence of proposition  [ fact ] above and theorem  [ thm3 ] ( discussed in section  [ tech ] ) :    if a bipartite system have dynamics given by @xmath31 for all @xmath20 , there is no ftd if , and only if , @xmath32 . [ closedsystems ]    indeed , if the family @xmath1 is such that , for some @xmath17 , @xmath33 is not a local unitary operation , there exists an entangled state @xmath34 such that @xmath35 is a product state ( see corollary  [ corentan ] ) .",
    "take small enough @xmath36 such that @xmath37 is still an entangled state .",
    "we then have that @xmath38 is a state _ in the interior _ of the set of separable states ( a convex combination of an arbitrary point of a convex set with a point in the interior of it , results in an element also in its interior  @xcite ) . by proposition",
    "[ fact ] , ftd takes place .",
    "physically , although theorem  [ closedsystems ] allows for very general interactions between the systems , it is restrictive with respect to their interaction with their environment , since this environment must be effectively classic .",
    "here we greatly relax this restriction , on the expense of diminishing the range of quantum systems considered .",
    "if a bipartite system with hilbert space @xmath29 , where @xmath39@xmath40 , have a dynamics such that @xmath41 for all @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ each map is unital ) , there is no ftd if , and only if , @xmath32 .

    "let us look to each situation :    @xmath43 of course , if this holds for all @xmath20 , we do not have ftd .",

    "@xmath44 finally , if this is the case , the continuity of the family of maps allows us to conclude for the existence of a @xmath58 where @xmath59 fits in either cases @xmath45 or @xmath46 , since the set of cptp maps induced by such unitaries is disjoint from the set induced by local unitaries ( a continuous path between two disjoint sets must necessarily pass trough the complement of them ) .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate how common is the phenomenon of finite time disentanglement ( ftd ) with respect to the set of quantum dynamics of bipartite quantum states with finite dimensional hilbert spaces . considering a quantum dynamics from a general sense , as just a continuous family of completely positive trace preserving maps ( parametrized by the time variable ) acting on the space of the bipartite systems , we conjecture that ftd happens for all dynamics but those when all maps of the family are induced by local unitary operations . </S>",
    "<S> we prove this conjecture valid for two important cases : i ) when all maps are induced by unitaries ; ii ) for pairs of qubits , when all maps are unital . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we prove some general results about unitaries / cptp maps preserving product / pure states </S>"
