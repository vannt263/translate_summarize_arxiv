    "note that in principle homodyne detection is insensitive to frequency fluctuations of the laser since the laser is interfered with itself when a common lo is used , however , in practice the two arms of the interferometer are never exactly the same length and the interference is between light emitted by the laser at different times resulting in a conversion of frequency noise to intensity noise which is detected .",
