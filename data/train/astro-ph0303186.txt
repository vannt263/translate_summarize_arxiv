    "several upcoming space missions aim to detect extrasolar planets with masses of order 1  @xmath1 .",
    "the space interferometry mission ( sim ) should be able to detect extrasolar planets down to @xmath5 @xmath1 astrometrically by observing the reflex orbital motions of their host stars @xcite .",
    "the kepler and corot missions are designed to photometrically detect planets with the same radius as the earth by observing the dimming of their host stars during planetary transits .",
    "eventually , missions like the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) and darwin should directly detect extrasolar planets around nearby stars and take their spectra , searching for planets as faint as the earth in either reflected light @xcite or thermal emission @xcite .",
    "earth - mass planets offer particular biological interest if they orbit in the habitable zone , the range of circumstellar radii where stable liquid water can exist on the surface of a planet that is in thermal equilibrium with stellar radiation @xcite . in the solar system , this zone covers roughly the region between the orbits of venus ( 0.72  au ) and mars ( 1.52  au ) . natural places to look for life - bearing extrasolar planets are the habitable zones of nearby stars .",
    "discussions of extrasolar planets often quietly assume that any object with mass @xmath6 orbiting in a star s habitable zone will be terrestrial , i.e , composed mostly of silicates and iron - peak elements  like the earth . however , we suggest that the habitable zones of nearby stars could harbor other similar - looking beasts .",
    "planets composed substantially of volatiles can conceivably form with masses up to @xmath7 and migrate inward to the habitable zone .",
    "we estimate that earth - sized volatile - rich planets can retain their volatiles for billions of years at @xmath4  au , protected by thick atmospheres that slowly undergo hydrodynamic escape .",
    "the snow line in a protoplanetary disk @xcite occurs where the temperature of the nebular gas drops below the sublimation temperature for water ( 170  k in a vacuum ) . in popular planet - formation scenarios ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , planets form much faster beyond the snow line than in the warmer center of the disk because outside the snow line , frozen volatiles provide more solid building material .",
    "protoplanets beyond the snow line more massive than a threshold mass roughly equal to the presumed core masses of jupiter and saturn rapidly accrete gas , becoming gas giants ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "protoplanets beyond the snow line less massive than this threshold grow slowly , and when the gaseous disk has dispersed they remain small balls of ice and rock , like pluto and the icy moons of the outer planets .",
    "icy planets and moons that form near the snow line should contain mostly h@xmath2o and silicates .",
    "those that form farther out can acquire nh@xmath3 and ch@xmath8 as hydrates , together with co , n@xmath9 , and co@xmath9 . beyond the snow line ,",
    "the solar nebula does not have time to reach chemical equilibrium , making it hard to predict the relative ratios of these compounds @xcite .",
    "icy bodies more massive than @xmath10  @xmath1 form with enough accretional energy that they begin life with their ice mostly melted @xcite .",
    "these objects must freeze again in the outer solar system , though the details of this process remain uncertain .",
    "jupiter s moon ganymede has a mass of only 0.02  @xmath1 , but it makes a good reference point @xcite .",
    "ganymede has a diameter larger than that of mercury ( 0.06  @xmath1 ) ; its mean density suggests that it is roughly 60% silicate rock and metal and 40% volatiles .",
    "water ice appears to cover most of ganymede s surface ; this ice may top an ocean maintained by radiogenic heating @xcite .",
    "objects even richer in water could possibly form near the snow line , where water may collect due to diffusion in the solar nebula @xcite .",
    "interaction with a circumstellar disk can cause protoplanets to migrate inward from the snow line @xcite .",
    "ice planets could form with masses up to the threshold for rapid gas accretion ( @xmath7 ) ; low mass objects in this category undergo `` type i '' migration in a massive protoplanetary disk , which appears to occur on timescales of @xmath11 years , where @xmath12 is the mass of the planet @xcite .",
    "if the volatile - rich planet migrates after the @xmath13  year period of terrestrial planet formation at @xmath4  au , it has a better chance of surviving near the star .",
    "even after the outer protoplanetary disk has dissipated , interaction with other protoplanets can scatter an icy body into an orbit with small pericenter @xcite , where further encounters , stellar tides @xcite or disk tides @xcite can circularize its orbit .",
    "scattered earth - mass planetesimals in the outer solar system may have generated the obliquity of uranus and neptune @xcite and the high inclination kuiper belt objects @xcite .",
    "a volatile planet may not even need to migrate to get to the habitable zone .",
    "recent models of flared disks around young stars suggest that the snow line could be as close - in as 1  au in a disk around a solar - mass star @xcite . asteroids orbiting between 2.6 and 3.5 au ( most c - type asteroids ) contain minerals that appear to have undergone aqueous alteration , suggesting that they contained water ice when they formed ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "a snowline located closer - in than 2.6 au would naturally explain the existence of icy primitive asteroids .",
    "a water planet arriving at @xmath4  au should quickly develop a steam atmosphere of 100 bars or more , like the atmosphere of the accreting earth @xcite . such an atmosphere can easily become a runaway greenhouse when accretional impacts deliver an energy flux @xmath14 the solar constant to its base .",
    "but in the absence of such an energy source , the two - stream model of @xcite suggests that a steam atmosphere of @xmath15  bars simply provides stable greenhouse heating up to a temperature of @xmath16 at its base , where @xmath17 is the ratio of the opacity at thermal wavelengths to the opacity at short wavelengths , @xmath18 is the albedo for single - scattering at short wavelengths , and @xmath19 is the local blackbody temperature ; @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the radius of the planet s orbit , and",
    "@xmath22 is the luminosity of the star .",
    "since @xmath17 is likely to be in the range of 10100 ( @xmath23 for venus ) , and @xmath18 is likely to be almost 1 , @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath25  k , the critical temperature of water , water simply condenses out of a steam atmosphere that is in equilibrium with stellar radiation , leaving a hot ocean on the planet s surface @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the planet s vaporization halts , and the planet can survive indefinitely as long as it retains its atmosphere .",
    "this condition holds where @xmath26 , for @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "closer in , the planet will slowly vaporize ( or sublimate , if ice remains on its surface ) at a rate set by the rate of energy transport through the base of the optically thick atmosphere , where the temperature will fall from @xmath29 to 647  k at the surface of the boiling ocean .",
    "the atmosphere would be stable against convection since it is heated from above ; downward energy transport in this stable layer will occur by slow diffusion of radiated thermal energy . the flux of energy transported by radiative diffusion through the lowest scale height of the atmosphere would be @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath32 is the rosseland mean optical depth of the layer .",
    "the temperature difference across the layer , @xmath33 will be @xmath34  k. the mean temperature , @xmath35 , will be roughly @xmath36 .",
    "the more massive the atmosphere , the slower the vaporization ; this process is probably self - limiting .",
    "the vaporization rate is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radius of the planet , and @xmath39 erg  g@xmath40 is the latent heat of vaporization of water .",
    "the optical depth of the atmosphere will increase as more volatiles sublimate , but when @xmath41 , the vaporization rate reaches @xmath42  @xmath43  yr@xmath40 , i.e. , it effectively halts .    suspended aerosols in the atmosphere could easily provide a continuum mass opacity of @xmath44  @xmath45  g@xmath40 , like clouds in brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the planet should have a radius similar to that of the zero temperature sphere described by @xcite ; a zero temperature sphere with mean atomic mass per atom of 13  amu ( half h@xmath9o , half sio@xmath9 ) has a radius of @xmath46  r@xmath47 . with these assumptions ,",
    "the limiting optical depth amounts to a mass of gas @xmath48    though this thick atmosphere can protect the planet s volatiles from vaporization , the planet is vulnerable during the first billion years of the solar system s life , when the star shines brightly in the euv , and the planet suffers heavy bombardment by planetesimals",
    ". we will consider each of these processes in turn .",
    "stellar euv photons can raise the kinetic energy of gas molecules above the escape velocity , eroding the planet .",
    "for example , pluto has probably lost a few km of surface ice during its lifetime to an euv driven wind ( see the review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can estimate the escape rate by estimating the radius , @xmath49 , where the atmosphere first becomes optically thick to euv .",
    "this parameter sets the effective cross - section of the planet for absorbing stellar euv and also the thickness of the layer which must conduct the deposited energy to the surface",
    ". we will neglect the vertical thickness of the opaque region of the atmosphere just above the surface ; its scale height should be @xmath50 ( assuming steam at 647  k ) , much less than the typical scale height of the upper layers .",
    "this approximation works as long as most of the planet remains liquid ( or ice ) so the atmosphere has only a small fraction of the planet s mass .",
    "@xcite and @xcite modeled the escape of pluto s atmosphere and the atmospheres of the primordial earth and venus using a one - dimensional hydrodynamic model based on the model for the solar wind by @xcite .",
    "this model estimates the effective value of @xmath49 for the case of maximum escape flux by assuming all the euv energy is deposited in a thin layer at @xmath49 .",
    "this maximum escape flux provides a lower limit for the lifetime of the bound gas .",
    "@xcite define the variables @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mass of a gas molecule .",
    "the base of the exosphere , which we will consider to be located at @xmath38 , has temperature @xmath55 , which we take to be @xmath56 .",
    "the flux of escaping particles per steradian per second is @xmath57 , and the effective euv heating rate is @xmath58 , in erg  @xmath59  s@xmath40 , averaged over a sphere .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the gas is assumed to take the form @xmath60 .",
    "the maximum escaping flux satisfies @xcite : @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "we solved these equations numerically for @xmath64 as a function of @xmath65 and @xmath66 and integrated the mass loss rate , @xmath67 , over time , @xmath68 , since the birth of the planetary system . since vaporization immediately replaces mass lost to the euv - driven wind",
    ", @xmath69 is the mass evolution of the planet .",
    "this hydrodynamic model applies when @xmath70 , i.e. , the atmosphere is tightly bound .",
    "as @xmath66 decreases , euv penetrates deeper into the atmosphere , and @xmath49 approaches @xmath38 ( see figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that when @xmath71 , @xmath49=@xmath38 , meaning that the euv penetrates all the way to where the atmosphere becomes opaque near the surface of the planet . in this case ,",
    "@xmath72 .",
    "the thermosphere may have complicated photochemistry ; euv can dissociate any of the key atmospheric molecules ( h@xmath2o , nh@xmath3 , ch@xmath8 , co , n@xmath9 , and co@xmath9 ) .",
    "but we can conservatively estimate the loss rate of these compounds as the escape rate for monatomic h ( m = @xmath73  g ) .",
    "@xcite calculate that the thermal conductivity for h is @xmath74  erg  cm@xmath40  s@xmath40  k@xmath40 between @xmath76 and 2000  k.    the effective value of the present day euv flux at the earth is @xmath77  erg  @xmath59  s@xmath40 @xcite .",
    "younger solar - mass stars can easily have 100 times as much euv output as the sun .",
    "we assume that @xmath78  s@xmath79 at @xmath80  billion years and thereafter .",
    "we assume that prior to that , the euv output evolved as @xmath81 , up to @xmath82  s@xmath83 following @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : survival ] shows the euv survival time  the time for an all - volatile planet to lose half of its mass to an euv - driven wind  as a function of initial mass for planets at @xmath84 , 0.3 , 0.1 , and 0.04  au .",
    "the figure suggests that an earth - mass volatile - rich planet as close as 0.3  au from a sunlike star can easily retain its volatiles for the age of the solar system .",
    "our model of euv - driven escape assumes that most of that planet , say 90% , remains ice or liquid , so that the base of the thermosphere sits near the planet s surface .",
    "we estimate that this situation occurs only where @xmath85 .",
    "the dashed sections of the curves in figure  [ fig : survival ] indicate the regime where this condition is not satisfied .",
    "since volatile - rich earth - mass planets slowly lose mass to a euv - driven wind , these planets should be more common around younger stars and stars with lower time - averaged euv luminosity .",
    "nearby f- , g- , and k - type main - sequence stars have similar levels of euv output , but nearby m - type main - sequence stars have systematically lower euv luminosities than more massive nearby main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "this difference might make m - type stars particularly hospitable to close - in , volatile - rich earth - mass planets .",
    "we assume that the volatile - rich planets migrate after the usual period of terrestrial planet accretion in habitable zone .",
    "but `` heavy '' bombardment by leftover planetesimals continued on the terrestrial planets in our solar system for roughly the first billion years of the solar system s life .",
    "such a bombardment can erode the atmosphere of a planet ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "a low - mass volatile - rich planet will have escape velocity @xmath86 .",
    "ejecting a mass @xmath87 of material from the planet requires energy @xmath88 .",
    "but the impactors available in the early solar system would rarely have impact velocities more than a few times @xmath89 , so an impactor probably could not eject more than roughly its own mass from the planet s atmosphere , given the @xmath907% efficient ejection process found in numerical models of large impacts on the earth @xcite .",
    "moreover , only impactors with diameter greater than the scale height of the atmosphere impart a substantial fraction of their energy to the atmosphere @xcite ; smaller impactors just add mass to the planet .",
    "a scale height of 59  km corresponds to a projectile with mass @xmath91  kg .",
    "we appropriate a description provided by @xcite for the flux of impactors on mars and the moon based on crater densities .",
    "the number of projectiles per year of mass greater than @xmath92 that fall on a planet of effective radius @xmath93 is @xmath94 where we have neglected gravitational focusing  a factor of a few when scaling from mars to a 1  @xmath1 planet .",
    "if we consider only impactors with masses between @xmath95  kg and 1% of the mass of the moon on a planet with @xmath96 , equation  [ eq : impactor ] implies a total mass of impactors of less than 0.003  @xmath1 .",
    "this total mass of impactors poses no hazard whatsoever , even to the survival of an 0.1  @xmath1 volatile - rich planet",
    ".    however , the above impactor distribution fails at the high mass end ; it does not account for the unusual impactors @xcite that have masses comparable to a terrestrial planet . such giant impactors probably created the earth s moon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may have spun up mars @xcite and robbed mercury of its low - density material @xcite .",
    "conceivably , a giant impactor with high enough velocity could remove all the volatiles from a 1  @xmath1 volatile planet .",
    "the proximity of the snow line to 1 au in accretion disk models suggests that volatile - rich planets can easily migrate into the habitable zones of solar - type stars .",
    "as long as they migrate after terrestrial planet formation and manage to avoid giant impacts , we estimate that volatile - rich planets as small as 0.1  @xmath1 can retain most of their volatiles for the lifetime of the solar system as close as 0.3  au from a solar - type star .",
    "closer - in objects may also retain volatiles , but our analysis fails at high heating rates , where the atmosphere s mass becomes substantial .",
    "exterior to @xmath97 , a water planet can exist in equilibrium with stellar radiation , protected by a thick steam atmosphere . inside this radius ,",
    "the planet slowly vaporizes , but we estimate that only a mass of water given by equation  [ eq : maxmass ] can vaporize in @xmath98 years . conceivably , both the earth and mars could once have been volatile - rich , but both have probably suffered large impacts .",
    "volatile - rich planets should be more common in the habitable zones of young stars and m - type stars .",
    "volatile - rich earth - mass planets could appear in future surveys for extrasolar earth analogs .",
    "these objects should maintain deep layers of liquid water , melted by accretional energy and radionucleides .",
    "at a given mass , a volatile - rich planet should have a slightly larger radius and therefore a greater luminosity than a terrestrial planet .",
    "finding such objects would test core - accretion scenarios for giant planet formation .",
