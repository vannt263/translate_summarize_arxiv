    "a basic theoretical question in all these cases is whether one can calculate the @xmath0-@xmath2 curve using a suitable model , which to a large extent involves an estimate for @xmath3 and a theory for the singular behavior around the transition .",
    "the first part has been essentially answered twenty years ago in the pioneering work of larkin @xcite .",

    "the difficulty has to do with the fact that the depinning transition is a nonequilibrium critical phenomenon which involves correlated motion of all parts of the system .",
    "as it turns out , the key to the solution lies in properly renormalizing the random - force correlator that characterizes the medium .",
    "the present paper is an extension of an earlier one where the basic procedure and results of a functional renormalization group ( rg ) treatment of the interface problem were reported @xcite .",
    "the strategy we followed is very similar to the ones for treating equilibrium critical phenomena : the interface model has an upper critical dimension @xmath9 above which perturbation theory ( expanding around a flat , moving interface ) converges at weak disorder . for @xmath10 , it is possible to transform the perturbation theory into a rg procedure using momentum shell integration , which yields flow equations for the parameters of the model . from the fixed point solution of the flow equations one obtains exponents that characterize the depinning transition .",

    "the effect of the @xmath22 factor on the left - hand - side of ( [ meqmsqg ] ) is more subtle .",

    "suppose we accept ( [ 8 ] ) as a reasonable model for the driven interface , what can one say about its properties before trying to solve it ?",
    "surely enough , one can arrive at an important conclusion on the existence of the depinning transition below a certain critical dimension , and an estimate for the threshold force @xmath3 in the case of weak disorder , using a simple argument due originally to larkin @xcite and developed in the interface context by bruinsma and aeppli @xcite .",
    "let us recall the argument below .",
    "we begin with the remark , that a completely flat interface is never pinned .",
    "indeed , the total random force on a piece of a flat interface of extension @xmath44 is roughly @xmath45 as follows easily from ( 4 ) .",
    "this has to be compared with the total driving force @xmath46 , which will always win for @xmath47 .    for a rough interface",
    "this estimate is only valid on scales @xmath44 at which the typical interface distortion @xmath48 is smaller than @xmath49 and hence pinning is possible for small @xmath2 .",
    "however , roughness of the interface will be suppressed by the curvature force @xmath50 , which tends to flatten the interface . in @xmath51 dimension",
    "the curvature force will always win on sufficiently large length scales .",
    "for very weak disorder , @xmath52 , there is no length scale down to @xmath35 at which the interface is rough and hence there is no pinning @xmath53 .",
    "( pinning is however possible for larger disorder ) .",
    "the situation is different for @xmath54 : the pinning forces can not be balanced by the elastic forces for @xmath55 on length scales larger than the larkin length @xcite , @xmath56^{1/\\epsilon},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 . beyond this length ,",
    "the rough interface explores the random environment to acquire a finite pinning force per unit area .",
    "the force that is needed to get the interface out of a typical pinned configuration is thus of the order of @xcite @xmath58      the argument presented above suggests that , below the critical dimension @xmath9 , there is a depinning transition at a finite strength of the driving force .",
    "an observation due to middleton @xcite , originally made in the cdw context , makes it plausible that @xmath0 is a continuous function of @xmath2 .",
    "thus the transition , if it exists , should be continuous and the interface is expected to exhibit critical fluctuations at the transition and crossovers away from the transition @xcite .",
    "we discussed already , that the interface is rough .",
    "in particular , we will assume , that the interface is self - affine , an assumption which has to be proven afterwards .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit the height correlation function is assumed to obey the following scaling form @xmath59 ^ 2\\rangle\\sim    with @xmath60 const for @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath18 ( not to be confused with the interface height ) are roughness and dynamic exponents , respectively .    for @xmath64",
    "there is a length ( and correspondingly , time ) scale , above which one can neglect the non - linearity of eq .",
    "( 3 ) , which is hidden in the random force term .",
    "going over to a co - moving frame @xmath65 , where @xmath0 is the mean interface velocity and @xmath66 , we consider first the case of high velocity .",
    "then @xmath67 can be replaced by @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath26 acts as a thermal noise . in this case",
    "the exponents are @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 @xcite . upon decreasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the non - linearity becomes more important .",
    "indeed , if a small part of the interface hits an obstacle , it will first keep its position , i.e. @xmath74 in the argument of @xmath75 will decrease by @xmath76 from its original value to compensate the increase of @xmath77 .    the typical value of @xmath78 increases with @xmath79 according to ( 7 ) and ( 8) as @xmath80 . since @xmath81 for a well defined interface and @xmath82 ( as we will show below ) , @xmath48 changes more slowly than @xmath77 and there is a timescale @xmath83 where the @xmath77 term starts to dominate the argument of @xmath26 . on this time scale , the perturbation of the interface by the obstacle has spread over a region of linear size @xmath84 for larger time or length scales the effect of the non - linearity can be neglected and the above mentioned exponents apply . for smaller scales",
    "however , we expect new exponents dominated by the non - linear terms of ( 3 ) .",
    "if the velocity decreases close to the threshold as a power law @xmath85 we get @xmath86 with [ 8 ] @xmath87    another important constraint on the exponents follows from a harris type argument@xcite for a homogeneous transition in a disordered medium : indeed , let us divide the volume which includes the interface into correlated regions , each of linear size @xmath88 parallel and @xmath89 perpendicular to the interface , respectively .",
    "the typical fluctuation @xmath90 of the threshold force @xmath3 in such a region is @xmath91 to have a sharp transition , the condition @xmath92 for @xmath93 has to be fulfilled .",
    "this gives , together with ( 12 ) , @xmath94      above the upper critical dimension @xmath9 , the dimensional analysis of sec .",
    "ii.b suggests absence of a depinning threshold when the disorder is sufficiently weak .",
    "this conclusion can be verified explicitly using a perturbation theory discussed in the next section , provided @xmath67 is differentiable in @xmath18 .",
    "an exception is given by the case where @xmath67 may increase abruptly as @xmath18 increases ( i.e. , the pinning force weakens in a discontinuous way ) , leading to a sudden release of an interface segment . as the phenomenon has an analogy to avalanche motion in lower dimensions ,",
    "let us discuss it in some detail below .    for simplicity ,",

    "the pinning force @xmath116 is constant in each cell : @xmath117 with equal probability .",

    "( [ mft14 ] ) ] builds up to overtake the resisting force @xmath118 in the cell ahead , and then enters the new cell at a velocity of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "the situation is different at an upward discontinuity .",
    "when the particle reaches such a point , it suddenly experiences a pulling force by an amount @xmath119 greater , so that its velocity jumps by the same amount [ see eq .",
    "( [ mftnew ] ) ] .",

    "the distance between the two minima is given by @xmath122 .",
    "( [ lim+- ] ) , one finds @xmath123 .",
