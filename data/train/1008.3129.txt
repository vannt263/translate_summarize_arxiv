    "the extraction of ground - state decay constants from shifman  vainshtein  zakharov sum rules @xcite is a complicated problem : first , one should construct a reliable operator product expansion ( ope ) for the borel - transformed correlation function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the borel parameter , of two pseudoscalar heavy  light currents .",
    "we make use of the ope for this correlator to three - loop accuracy @xcite , reshuffled in terms of the @xmath5 heavy - quark masses , in which case the perturbative expansion exhibits a reasonable convergence @xcite .",
    "second , even if the parameters of this ope are known precisely , the knowledge of the truncated ope for a correlator allows one to extract the characteristics of the bound state only with some error which reflects the intrinsic uncertainty of the method of qcd sum rules . acquiring control over this systematic uncertainty poses a very subtle problem  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have formulated a novel approach for extracting ground - state parameters from some correlator @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall the most essential features of our approach : as consequence of the assumption of quark  hadron duality the ground - state contribution and the ope with a cut applied at some effective continuum threshold @xmath13 are related by @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the perturbative spectral density known to order @xmath16 ; @xmath17 describes the series of power corrections expressed in terms of condensates of increasing dimensions .    of course , in order to extract the decay constant one has to fix the effective continuum threshold @xmath13 . moreover , as is obvious from ( [ sr_qcd ] ) , @xmath13 should be a function of @xmath12 .",
    "otherwise the @xmath12-dependences of the l.h.s .  and",
    "the r.h.s .  of ( [ sr_qcd ] ) do not match each other .",
    "however , the _ exact effective threshold _ , corresponding to employing on the l.h.s .  of ( [ sr_qcd ] )",
    "the exact  hadron mass and decay constant , is clearly not known .",
    "the extraction of hadron parameters from the sum rule consists therefore in attempting ( i ) to find a good approximation to the exact continuum threshold and ( ii ) to acquire control over the accuracy of this approximation .",
    "let us introduce the dual invariant mass @xmath18 and the dual decay constant @xmath19 by the definitions @xmath20 if the mass of the ground state is known , any deviation of this dual mass from the actual ground - state mass yields an indication of the excited - state contributions picked up by  the dual correlator .",
    "assuming a specific functional form of the effective continuum threshold and requiring the least deviation of the dual mass ( [ fdual ] ) from the known ground - state mass in the borel window leads to a variational solution for the effective threshold .",
    "as soon  as this latter quantity has been fixed , one calculates the decay constant from ( [ fdual ] ) .",
    "the ( nave ) standard assumption for the effective threshold is that it is just a @xmath12-independent constant .",
    "in addition to this approximation , we have considered polynomials in @xmath12 : the reproduction of the dual mass improves considerably for the @xmath12-dependent quantities , which means  that a dual correlator with @xmath12-dependent threshold isolates the ground - state contribution  much better and is less contaminated by excited states than a dual correlator with the traditional @xmath12-independent threshold . as consequence ,",
    "the accuracy of extracted hadron observables improves considerably .",
    "experience gained from the study of potential models shows  that the band of values obtained from the linear , quadratic , and cubic anstze for the effective threshold encompasses the true value of the decay constant @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that  the extraction procedures in quantum theory and qcd are quantitatively very similar  to  each other @xcite .",
    "this talk summarizes our recent findings @xcite on heavy - meson decay constants .",
    "applying our extraction procedures to the charmed mesons yields the following  results : @xmath21 the ope error is obtained by the bootstrap allowing for variation of the qcd parameters ( quark masses , @xmath22 , condensates ) in the relevant ranges .",
    "one observes a perfect agreement of our predictions with the lattice computations ( fig .",
    "[ plot : dresults ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that  the @xmath12-dependent threshold constitutes a crucial ingredient for the successful extraction of the decay constant from the sum rule .",
    "obviously , the standard @xmath12-independent approximation yields a much lower value for @xmath23 which lies rather far from the data and the lattice  results .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     match the average of the lattice results yields a rather precise value of the @xmath6-quark mass : @xmath24 for this value of @xmath25 , our sum - rule estimates for the @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson decay constants  are @xmath26",
    "we presented the results of our recent analysis of the heavy - meson decay constants from the correlator of pseudoscalar currents @xcite .",
    "our special emphasis was laid on the study  of _ all _ uncertainties in the extracted value of the decay constant , viz .",
    ", on the ope uncertainty related to the not precisely known qcd parameters and on the intrinsic uncertainty of  the method related to a limited accuracy of the extraction procedure .",
    "according to our recent findings , the accuracy of the sum - rule predictions may be considerably improved and the intrinsic uncertainties of hadron parameters may be probed by allowing for @xmath12-dependent anstze for the effective continuum threshold .",
    "the parameters of this effective threshold can be fixed by minimizing the deviation of the dual mass from the known meson  mass  in the window .",
    "this strategy has now been applied to the decay constants of heavy mesons .",
    "the analysis of charm mesons unambiguously demonstrates that the application of the borel - parameter - dependent effective threshold leads to two essential improvements : ( i ) the accuracy of decay constants extracted from the sum rule is considerably improved ; ( ii ) it has become possible to derive realistic systematic uncertainties and to reduce their values to the level of a few percent . by application of our novel extraction procedures  the results from qcd sum rules have been brought into a perfect agreement with the findings from lattice qcd and experiment .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay constants are extremely sensitive to the precise value of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , no reasonable predictions for the decay constants may be extracted unless the @xmath6-quark mass is known with very high accuracy . on the other hand",
    ", the strong sensitivity of these decay constant to the @xmath6-quark mass opens the promising possibility to extract  the @xmath6-quark mass if the decay constant is known .",
    "following this line and matching the results from qcd sum rules for @xmath8 to the average of the lattice evaluations allows us to obtain a rather accurate estimate of the @xmath6-quark mass .",
    "our value is in good agreement with several lattice results but , interestingly , it does not overlap with the recent accurate determination of @xmath7 reported in @xcite ( see also [ 1 ] ) .",
    "clearly , this issue requires further investigation .",
