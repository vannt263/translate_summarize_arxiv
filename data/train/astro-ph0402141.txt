    "the symbiotic stars are currently understood as interacting binary systems consisting of a cool giant and a hot compact star , which is in most cases a white dwarf .",
    "typical orbital periods are between 1 and 3 years , but they can be significantly larger . the mass loss from the giant represents the primary condition for appearance of the symbiotic phenomenon .",
    "a part of the material lost by the giant is transferred to the more compact companion via accretion from the stellar wind or roche - lobe overflow .",
    "this process generates a very hot ( @xmath5k ) and luminous ( @xmath6 ) source of radiation . on the basis of the way in which the generated energy is being liberated , we distinguish two phases of symbiotic binary . _ quiescent phases _ during which the hot component releases its energy approximately at a constant rate and spectral distribution",
    "generally , we observe a wave - like variation in their lcs as a function of the orbital phase . during _ active phases _ the hot component radiation changes significantly , which leads to a 2 - 3mag brightening of the object in the optical .",
    "a common feature of active phases is a high - velocity mass ejection .",
    "generally , the hot radiation ionizes a fraction of the neutral circumbinary material , which gives rise to a strong nebular emission .",
    "this component of radiation is physically displaced from the hot star and its optically thick part can be very complex in its shape . in addition , its location and shaping in the binary depend on the level of the activity . as a result",
    "we often observe unexpected variation in the lcs as , for example , flares , drops in brightness , the effect of eclipses and outbursts .",
    "a very interesting feature of variability in this respect is the effect of eclipses , which is very sensitive to physical displacement and radiative contributions of individual components in the system . in the case",
    "that a significant fraction of radiation at the wavelength under consideration comes from the region which is subject to eclipse , a minimum in the lc is well observable . in the opposite case ,",
    "the eclipse effect is very faint . therefore the eclipse effect can be observed only at specific brightness phases , at which the radiative contribution from a pseudophotosphere in the optical rivals that from the nebula .",
    "accordingly , to reveal the above mentioned peculiarities in the lcs of symbiotic stars , it requires a very careful long - term monitoring programme . in this paper",
    "we present the recent observational results of such our programme obtained during the period december 2001 to december 2003 .",
    "we note that this paper continues the work of skopal _",

    "the majority of the @xmath7 measurements were performed in the standard johnson system using single - channel photoelectric photometers mounted in the cassegrain foci of 0.6-m reflectors at the skalnat pleso ( hereafter sp in tables ) and star lesn observatories ( sl ) .",
    "values in tables represent means of the whole observing cycle .",
    "usually , a 1-hour cycle contained about 10 to 20 individual differences between the target and the comparison .",
    "this approach reduced the _ inner _ uncertainty of such the means to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath9 and @xmath9mag in the @xmath2 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 filter , respectively .",
    "larger uncertainties ( about 0.1mag ) during some nights are marked in tables by :. further details about observation procedure are given in skopal _",
    "some observations in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands were made with the 50/70/172 cm schmidt telescope of the national astronomical observatory rozhen , bulgaria ( r ) .",
    "other details about utilities and treatment of observations as well as standard stars were already presented in s+02 .",
    "the @xmath13 observations of rwhya and ivvir were carried out at the san pedro mrtir observatory , baja california , mexico ( m ) , in 2003 april .",
    "also in this case further details are given in s+02 .",
    "observations of qwsge were performed by one of us ( zv ) at his private station belua near povask bystrica ( pb ) with a newton 180/700 telescope equipped with a ccd camera based on the texas instruments chip tc  211 ( from 01/01/2002 the chip was changed to tc-237b ) .",
    "a set of @xmath14 filters for a modified johnson - kron - cousins system was used .",
    "all frames were dark subtracted and flat fielded .",
    "transformation to the international system was made by measuring the standard stars in the star - cluster m67 .",
    "magnitudes of comparison stars were obtained in the same way as described in hric_et al . _",

    "in addition , 2800 visual magnitude estimates of arpav were obtained during 1982.2  2003.9 by one of us ( aj ) with a private 12\".5 f/5 reflector .",
    "other details concerning observations of arpav can be found in skopal _",
    "we measured egand ( hd4174 , bd+39167 ) with respect to hd4143 ( sao63173 , bd+372318 ) . to obtain magnitudes in @xmath10 and @xmath11 we used the standard star hd3914 ( @xmath11 = 7.00 , @xmath17 = 0.44 ) and conversion between both stars , hd4143  hd3914 = 4.640 , 2.722 and 1.563 in the @xmath2 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , respectively ( hric _ et al .",

    "/ around jd2452600 ( november 2002 ) the primary minimum occurred in the @xmath2-lc .",
    "it is relatively narrow in profile with respect to those previously observed ( e.g. at @xmath3jd2451160 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "a broad wave - like variation is less pronounced and , in addition , a 0.2  0.3mag brightening in @xmath2 was detected by the latest observations in the autumn of 2003 .",
    "these changes mean that the nebular component of radiation decreased and , instead , a pseudophotosphere with a more significant contribution in the optical was created around the central star . in such a case",
    "the light in @xmath2 should be rather of stellar nature .",
