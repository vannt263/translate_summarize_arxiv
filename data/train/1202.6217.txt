    "as opposed to classical quantum mechanics where electrons tunneling into a barrier are exponentially damped , relativistic scattering was shown by klein in 1929 @xcite to follow a very unexpected behavior : if the potential is of the order of the electron mass or higher the barrier becomes virtually transparent to the electrons .",
    "this is called the klein paradox .",
    "experimental realizations were not available until the recent discovery of graphene @xcite .",
    "this material has revealed a series of amazing properties , such as ultra - high electrical conductivity , ultra - low shear viscosity to entropy ratio , as well as exceptional structural strength , as combined with mechanical flexibility and optical transparency .",
    "many of these fascinating properties are due to the fact that , consisting of literally one single carbon monolayer , graphene represents the first instance ever of a truly two - dimensional material ( the `` ultimate flatland '' @xcite ) . moreover , due to the special symmetries of the honeycomb lattice , electrons in graphene are shown to behave like an effective dirac fluid of _ massless _ chiral quasi - particles , propagating at a fermi speed of about @xmath0 m / s .",
    "this configures graphene as an unique , slow - relativistic electronic fluid , where many unexpected quantum - electrodynamic phenomena can take place , @xcite .",
    "for instance , since electrons are about @xmath1 times slower than photons , their mutual interaction is proportionately enhanced , leading to an effective fine - structure constant @xmath2 . as a result of such strong interactions",
    ", it has been recently proposed that this peculiar 2d graphene electron gas should be characterized by an exceptionally low viscosity / entropy ratio ( near - perfect fluid ) , coming close to the famous ads - cft lower bound conjectured for quantum - chromodynamic fluids , such as quark - gluon plasmas @xcite .",
    "this spawns the exciting prospect of observing electronic pre - turbulence in graphene samples , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and confirmed by recent numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the zero - mass of electronic excitations in graphene may have other spectacular consequences .",
    "for instance , it has been recently pointed out @xcite that graphene could offer the first experimental of the so - called klein paradox , i.e. the capability of quantum wavefunctions to undergo zero reflection from a potential barrier much higher than the energy of the wavefunction itself .",
    "this property , which relies exclusively upon the spinorial nature of the dirac wavefunction , stands in stark contrast with the corresponding non - relativistic behavior , which predicts an exponential decay of the transmission coefficient with the difference @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the height of the barrier and @xmath5 the wavefunction energy .",
    "based on an analytical solution of the scattering problem for a monochromatic plane wave , the authors were able to show that , depending on a series of geometrical and energy parameters , special angles of incidence ( resonant angles ) provide literally zero reflectivity : the plane wave goes completely across the barrier . besides its intellectual charm , such property is of great practical interest for the study of electronic transport in graphene @xcite , and it is expected to play an important role in the understanding of the minimum conductivity of graphene @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the electronic spectrum of graphene can change depending on the substrate , for instance on sic the energy spectrum presents a gap of width @xmath6 , which makes it possible to model the electric transport by using the massive dirac equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is also interesting to study the klein tunneling in a random media for this kind of gaped - samples ( massive fermions case ) .    on the other hand , due to the fact that , under suitable conditions @xcite , electronic excitations in graphene behave as an effective relativistic dirac fluid , in the presence of a random media , transport laws similar to the ones ruling fluid motion in diluted porous media , may be expected to apply .",
    "we refer here , e.g. to the carman - kozeny law @xcite , which relates the permeability of a porous medium ( conductivity of a graphene sample ) to the solid concentration ( impurity density ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we introduce a brief description of the quantum lattice boltzmann ( qlb ) method @xcite ; second , we study the case of klein tunneling of a gaussian wave packet through a rectangular potential barrier .",
    "subsequently , we present numerical solutions of the dirac equation in the presence of random impurities , thereby providing an estimate for the effects of the impurity concentration on the conductivity of the graphene sample , for both cases , massless and massive dirac fermions .",
    "the simulations are performed using a qlb model , which is also introduced as a new tool to study transport phenomena in graphene .",

    "equation may thus be discretized using the same approach as in lattice boltzmann method , i.e. by integrating along the characteristic light - cones @xmath50 .",

    "note that this unitary operation is numerically _ exact _ , without round - off error , because the distribution function is integrally transferred from the source to the destination site , and no fractional transport is involved .",
    "since both streaming and collisions step are unitary , the overall qlb scheme evolves the discrete wavefunction through a sequence of unitary operations for any value of the discrete time step @xmath66 .",
    "in addition , since streaming proceeds upwind only ( no centered spatial differences ) along the discrete light - cones associated with each component @xmath67 , the qlb dispersion relation is automatically free from fermion - doubling , @xcite .",

    "the rotated matrices @xmath70 and @xmath87 have the same sign pattern as @xmath88 , but @xmath80 does not .",
    "summarizing , qlb provides a unitary , explicit algorithm for quantum wavefunctions in which information propagates along classical trajectories represented by a sequence of three one - dimensional light - cones , thereby avoiding any mixing of the spinorial components during the streaming step .",
    "although detailed comparisons with other techniques remain to be developed , there are reasons to believe that such simplification may result in enhanced computational efficiency , especially with parallel computers in mind .",
    "finally , we wish to point out that the same algorithm describes both relativistic and non - relativistic quantum wavepackets , depending on the value of the mass @xmath25 and the characteristic strength of the potential energy .",

    "both massless and massive wave - packets show a mild reduction of transmittivity , below @xmath234 .",
    "let us now define the following `` transmittance '' : @xmath235 this definition allows to draw a quantitative parallel with the concept of permeability of a classical fluid moving through a porous medium .",

    "it appears plausible to interpret the non - negligible surplus of relativistic conductivity , especially for the three cases with fermi energy @xmath202 , as an indirect manifestation of klein tunneling .",
    "in this paper we have performed a numerical study of a relativistic gaussian wave - packet propagating through a disordered medium , which we modeled as a set of randomly located potential barriers .    from the numerical results ,",
    "we conclude that for high concentration of impurities , the wave packet presents higher losses in momentum .",
    "furthermore , for a given impurity concentration , by increasing the potential of each impurity , we also find a loss of momentum .",
    "systems with massive excitations are also studied , which can be of relevance to the case of gaped graphene samples .",
    "a non - zero mass is found to produce higher losses of momentum in the impurity region .",
    "the actual numerical values show that at high impurity concentration , @xmath230 , the wavepacket looses more than half of its momentum with barriers of @xmath127 mev and up to @xmath246 with @xmath247 mev . at low concentrations , @xmath222 , however , the losses are much milder , going from about @xmath248 , for @xmath231 to @xmath128 mev , respectively",
    ".    these data can be regrouped into an analytical expression , which bears a strong similarity with the permeability of porous media , as a function of the porosity .",
    "we have estimated the value of the conductivity from the transmission coefficient and fitted it by using the carman - kozeny law for porous media , relating the permeability with the concentration of impurities we have found that this analogy works pretty well for the massive case , which shows no residual conductivity and a scaling exponent pretty close to unity . on the other hand , the massless case shows a residual conductivity , which can possibly be related to the minimum conductivity of graphene .",
    "moreover , for weak and intermediate potential strengths , the exponent is not unity , corresponding to a fractional kozeny - carman law . on the other hand , for strong potentials",
    ", the exponent @xmath140 is recovered to a good accuracy , bringing the results closer to the analogy with classical fluids @xcite .",
    "the applicability of this classical analogy indicates that , at least for the parameter set investigated in this paper , quantum tunneling is not the dominant transport mechanism , as compared to the semi - classical dynamics of the wave - function , which can turn around the obstacles in a similar way as a classical fluid would do .",
    "the results of this paper are expected to be amenable to experimental validation . for this purpose ,",
    "samples of graphene with local chemical doping could be used @xcite .",
    "in addition , for validating the results with massive particles , a substrate of sic will also be required , in order to generate the gap due to the presence of particle mass . finally , as a byproduct",
