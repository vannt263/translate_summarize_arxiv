    "<S> in fact , our sequence actually cancels the lowest two orders of error due to nuclear noise for this case .    </S>",

    "<S> both properties are by design , and spring from intuition that @xmath90 should always carry the qubit through at least a full circle of rotation around the bloch sphere , spending an equal amount of time at each pair of diametrically opposite points . since @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) performs these rotations about an axis orthogonal to the y - axis , the first - order @xmath83 error component generated at each point of the evolution ( not just during waiting times ) </S>",

    "<S> the nave pulse is taken to be the fastest possible with the same constraint on @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> as one would expect , the infidelity in the uncorrected sequence is roughly second - order while that of the corrected sequence appears to be fourth - order in @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",

    "<S> we now proceed to the cancellation of the exchange noise . </S>",
    "<S> this is not trivial because the strategy of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> does not apply due to the peculiar control - dependent form of the exchange noise . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , any similar form involving a cascade of @xmath45 rotations , @xmath100 , could only possibly work if the pulse form is chosen based on exact _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath58 , or in other words , the exact functional dependence of @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> since that is a sample - dependent property , it is far better to consider a form that will work more generally . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to find a @xmath45 pulse sequence which cancels exchange noise for any @xmath58 , we must invoke both @xmath45 and @xmath46 rotations  complicating matters by introducing another independent error source , @xmath102  and assign rotation angles to them such that all error terms are canceled simultaneously . to simplify the task ( no doubt at the cost of pulse length ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can build all rotations from the hyperfine - corrected building blocks @xmath103 so that we can focus on the exchange noise only . </S>",
    "<S> the algebra is rather involved , but in this way we have found a sequence which leads to a cancellation of exchange noise for both axes . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : jerror ] we show the infidelity of gates performing @xmath96 and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the red lines are for the case without the hyperfine error ; while blue lines are for hyperfine error @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> the corrected pulse clearly delivers improvement to the nave pulses for small charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> the improvement is appreciable only at very small @xmath112 because , although the first order error is completely cancelled , one is left with a large coefficient in the next order error . </S>",
    "<S> this coefficient could likely be reduced by further optimization of the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the relevant parameter regime for typical experiments is estimated to be that of small charge noise dominated by hyperfine noise @xcite , which is the regime where the fully - corrected pulse could already be useful in its current form .    , and ( b ) @xmath113 . here </S>",
    "<S> we have taken @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also taken @xmath99 and @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> again , these assumptions are for display purposes only . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the cost for the error cancellation is that we have made the pulse sequence long . for the hyperfine - corrected sequence , typically @xmath116 of rotation </S>",
    "<S> is needed . for the sequences </S>",
    "<S> robust against both hyperfine error and the exchange error , one would need @xmath117 of rotations . </S>",
    "<S> although this number seems challenging , recent experiment @xcite has demonstrated @xmath118 coherent rotations within @xmath119 ns , which is well below even their @xmath120 value ( a lower bound on @xmath121 ) of @xmath122ns . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that our hyperfine - corrected pulse sequence can be immediately implemented in experiments , while even the much longer , fully - corrected sequence could be within practicality . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for realistic situations one usually controls @xmath45 and @xmath46 with one single detuning , which can be used to further optimize the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the pulse sequence discussed in this paper is completely general , canceling @xmath47 and @xmath48 independently and making no assumption whatsoever on how the exchange depends on detuning . </S>",
    "<S> further optimization would require input of this information and could vary from system to system , requiring a case - by - case analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to consider error cancellation beyond the first order . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that in the absence of exchange error , hyperfine error can be corrected up to second order by cascading the pulse of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:3piecephi ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , pushing to higher orders does not necessarily improve the performance of the pulses , as shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore speculate that it would be more useful optimizing the pulse sequences presented here , rather than canceling higher orders of errors by a much longer sequence .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented analytical composite pulse sequences for arbitrary rotations of an exchange - only qubit , which are simultaneously robust against both quasistatic nuclear noise and charge noise . </S>",
    "<S> the form of our sequences satisfies the physical constraints of the exchange - only system , does not assume _ a priori _ knowledge of the exact functional dependence of the exchange interaction on detuning , and is realistic for current experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore believe that this control method will be immensely useful to on - going experimental efforts towards scalable arrays of qubits with all - electrostatic control .    </S>",
