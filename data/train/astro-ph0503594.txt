    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) play a key role in stellar astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "stars in a given gc are to a good approximation coeval , were born with the same initial chemical composition , and are located approximately at the same distance from the observer .",
    "these characteristics make them valuable benchmarks for testing stellar evolution theories through comparisons of theoretical isochrones and luminosity functions with their observational counterparts ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , due to the uniform age and initial chemical composition of stars belonging to a given cluster , the estimation of the cluster age is relatively straightforward , as shown in the pioneering work of @xcite , @xcite .    given that gcs are the oldest systems populating our galaxy ( and external galaxies ) for which an age estimate is feasible , their ages provide a lower limit to the age of the universe , whilst their relative ages ( and possible correlations with metallicity , abundance patterns , and position ) disclose fundamental information about galactic formation mechanisms and timescales .",
    "recent work on the age distribution of sizeable samples of gcs @xcite has led to a broadly consistent scenario in which metal poor clusters up to some intermediate metallicities are largely coeval , whereas at higher @xmath2}$ ] values an age spread exists , with possibly an age - metallicity relation . the age distribution with respect to the position within",
    "the galaxy shows that an age spread is present at all distances , without any correlation with the distance from the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , absolute age measurements are still affected by a number of uncertainties , in particular by the large remaining errors on the gc distances and reddening @xcite .",
    "relative ages can be obtained with much higher accuracy by measuring the position of the main sequence turn - off ( to )  which is the most - used age indicator  relative to some other feature in the colour magnitude diagram ( cmd ) whose location is little or not at all dependent on age ( stetson , vandenberg , & bolte 1996 , sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ) . however , any observed age indicator must be compared with theoretical predictions in order to derive an age .",
    "uncertainties in both the input physics @xcite , and the transformation from the theoretical to the observational plane @xcite , constitute a significant source of errors in the final age estimate , particularly when we want to compare ages of clusters with different metal content . in the present work ,",
    "in order to minimise the uncertainties coming from the models , we used an updated set of theoretical tracks .",
    "more specifically , the theoretical isochrones employed in our analysis are the @xmath10-enhanced counterparts of the @xcite model and isochrone library , and have already been discussed briefly in @xcite",
    ". the reliability and accuracy of this theoretical framework has already been tested by comparison with various empirical data sets by @xcite and by @xcite .    in the measurement of accurate relative ages , the photometric homogeneity of the data , and the homogeneity in the methods used to measure the age indicator parameters , are of fundamental importance , as we showed in @xcite , where , for the first time , we have been able to measure relative ages on a truly photometrically homogeneous database for a large sample ( 34 ) of gcs . in this paper",
    "we intend to extend the work of @xcite , by adding a new , larger , photometrically homogeneous catalogue of cmds , i.e. the hst snapshot catalogue by @xcite . for methodological consistency ,",
    "we have also re - measured all the parameters relevant for an age estimate in the cmds of @xcite used by @xcite .    the age - dating method used in our analysis",
    "is based on the magnitude difference @xmath11 ( in the @xmath12 band for the hst data , and in the analogous @xmath13-johnson band for the goundbased ones ) between the to and the horizontal branch ( hb ) , i.e. the so called vertical method @xcite .",
    "the to brightness is the age indicator ( the to gets fainter for increasing age ) whereas the hb level is unaffected in the age range typical of gcs ; this implies that older clusters display a larger value of @xmath11 .",
    "for ages around @xmath14  gyr the parameter @xmath11 scales approximately as @xmath15 . since it is a differential quantity , the comparison between observed and predicted @xmath11 values is unaffected by uncertainties in cluster reddening and distance modulus estimates , superadiabatic convection treatment in the stellar models as well as uncertainties in the colour - effective temperature relation adopted for transferring the models from the theoretical plane to the observational one .",
    "another advantage of using the @xmath11 parameter as age indicator is that it is weakly sensitive to uncertainties in the cluster @xmath2}$ ] , because at a fixed age the to magnitude scales with @xmath2}$ ] almost like the hb level .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the observational data , the measurement of the @xmath11 from the observed cmds , and the estimate of the associated errors .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the estimate of the age distribution of our cluster sample .",
    "a discussion of the main results is in section  4 .",
    "conclusions are in section  5 .",
    "the present investigation is based on two databases of gc cmds :    * the hst snapshot database of @xcite ; * the groundbased database of @xcite .",
    "each of the two databases is internally photometrically homogeneous .",
    "all the cmds from both catalogues can be found at the padova globular cluster group web page + ( http://dipastro.pd.astro.it/globulars ) .    here , for the first time , we present an age estimate based on the hst snapshot catalogue .",
    "this is a catalogue of cmds for @xmath16 galactic gcs , observed in their central regions with the wfpc2/hst camera in the photometric bands @xmath17 and @xmath12 ( similar to the @xmath18 , @xmath13 in the johnson - cousins photometric system ) . for details about the observations ,",
    "the reduction , and the photometric measurements please refer to @xcite .",
    "the groundbased database has already been used for relative age measurements by @xcite , who selected the best cmds from the two , photometrically homogeneous data sets collected , respectively , at the eso / dutch telescope ( for the southern sky gcs ) by @xcite , and at the isaac newton group jacobus kapteyn telescope ( for the northern gcs ) by @xcite . for details about the observations , the reduction , and the photometric measurements please refer to @xcite .",
    "forty one out of @xmath16 clusters from the hst snapshot catalogue , and @xmath19 out of @xmath20 clusters from the groundbased catalogues , have a cmd which can be used for an age measurement .",
    "the remaining objects were excluded for several reasons : too shallow photometry , large field contamination , small number of member stars .",
    "sixteen clusters are in common between the two catalogues , which allowed us to check the consistency of the ages derived from the two databases . combining the two catalogues , we have been able to estimate ages for @xmath0 gcs , representing more than @xmath21% of the galactic gc population .",
    "these gcs cover a metallicity interval @xmath22}<-0.3 $ ] , and are located from the very central part of the galaxy out to @xmath23 kpc , therefore extending the metallicity and galactocentric distance coverage of the original @xcite paper .    in our attempt to be as homogeneous as possible , and consistent with our previous investigations based on the hst snapshot catalogue",
    ", we have adopted the metallicities listed in @xcite calibrated over both the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cg ) , as extended by @xcite , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zw ) metallicity scales . in this paper",
    ", we will present the results obtained adopting both metallicity scales .",
    "for those clusters that do not appear in the @xcite catalogue , we adopted the original zw value when available .",
    "otherwise , we calculated the zw metallicity from ( * ? ? ? * in the revised version of 2003 ) by fitting a straight line to the relation between the two scales . for clusters not in the @xcite compilation , @xmath2}$ ] values in the cg system were calculated from zw values using the following equation @xcite : @xmath2}_{cg } = 0.61 + 3.04 { \\rm [ fe / h]}_{zw } + 1.981 { \\rm [ fe / h]}_{zw}^2 + 0.532 { \\rm [ fe / h]}_{zw}^3 $ ] .",
    "all the other cluster parameters used in this paper have been extracted from ( * ? ? ? * in the revised version of 2003 ) .",
    "the relevant age indicator parameters described below have been extracted from both databases .",
    "it is worth emphasising the fact that the hst snapshot cmds are in the @xmath17 , @xmath12 wfpc2 flight system , while the groundbased cmds are in the @xmath13 , @xmath24 johnson - cousins photometric system .",
    "therefore , the vertical parameters obtained from the two databases can not be directly compared .",
    "first , they must be compared with the theoretical models , transformed into the appropriate observational plane , for the age determinations .",
    "only these final ages can be compared .    in order to apply the vertical method",
    ", we need to measure the magnitude of the to point and the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) level .    for the to measurement , we proceeded in the following way .",
    "first , the cmd of each clusters was cleaned by selecting stars based on the daophot psf fitting parameters ( chi , sha ) and their photometric errors .",
    "second , we extracted the fiducial main sequence ( ms ) for each cluster by taking the median of the colour distributions obtained in magnitude boxes containing a fixed number of stars , ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , depending on the total number of ms stars . a preliminary to",
    "was then defined as the bluest point of the ms fiducial lines . for each cluster",
    ", we extracted a number of different ms fiducial lines by using different numbers of stars per box , and for each fiducial ms we associated a preliminary to to its bluest point . finally , we adopted as to magnitude the mean value of all the preliminary tos .",
    "the error on the mean of the preliminary to magnitudes gave a first estimate of the error associated to the adopted to magnitude .",
    "the to magnitude error was then better quantified following the procedure explained in the next section .    for the zahb magnitudes of the hst snapshot clusters",
    ", we adopted the values recently published by @xcite .",
    "they present distance moduli and reddening estimates for @xmath27 galactic globular clusters , based on the same photometric catalogue we are using here .",
    "the zahb magnitudes were estimated starting from the rr  lyrae level , for low and intermediate metallicity clusters , and from the fainter envelope of the red hb , for metal rich ones . for a detailed description of the adopted method",
    ", please refer to @xcite . here",
    "it suffices to say briefly that :    * the zahb level for _ metal rich clusters _ ( @xmath2}\\geq-1.0 $ ] ) was set as the magnitude of the lower envelope of the hb minus @xmath28 times the photometric error ( resulting from artificial star experiments ) at that magnitude ; * for _ low and intermediate metallicity clusters _ ( @xmath2}<-1.0 $ ] ) , a template cluster with similar metallicity and with a sizeable population of rr  lyrae stars was selected from the literature .",
    "five different templates were used to cover the entire metallicity range .",
    "the cmd of the template cluster was shifted in colour and magnitude until its hb overlapped the hb of the cluster whose zahb level was to be determined .",
    "this procedure allowed to obtain the mean apparent magnitude of the cluster rr  lyrae stars which was then transformed into the apparent zahb magnitude by using the relation @xcite : @xmath29}.\\ ] ]    for methodological consistency , we repeated the measures of the to and zahb magnitudes also for the groundbased cmds .",
    "the to measurement method by @xcite is very similar to what we did in the present paper , while the approach to obtaining the zahb magnitudes is completely different .",
    "the new zahb magnitudes for the groundbased cmds have been measured exactly as described above for the hst data , and in more detail by @xcite . for the groundbased low and intermediate metallicity clusters we used the same templates as for the hst ones . however , the reference cmds are different , as the groundbased catalogue is in the @xmath13 , @xmath24 photometric system .",
    "table  [ ground ] lists the reference clusters , the metallicity range of the comparison clusters , and the source of the photometry for the reference cmds .",
    "figures  [ fig0a ] and [ fig0b ] show two examples of our results .",
    "the cmds of two clusters are shown , one from the groundbased catalogue ( ngc  6218 ) and one from the the snapshot database ( ngc  362 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig0a ] , the brighter part of the cmd of one of the templates used for the zahb measurements is also shown .",
    "the template is ngc  5904 .",
    "ngc  6218 has a quite scarcely populated hb , nevertheless by applying our technique we were able to estimate the zahb magnitude .",
    "we would like to emphasise the fact that ngc  6218 is also contained in the snapshot catalogue and zahb measurements were made on the hst cmd and published by @xcite .",
    "those measurements are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the groundbased cmd , considering the different but similar bandpasses .      in order to estimate the uncertainty in the adopted to magnitude",
    ", we used the same method as in @xcite .",
    "we built about one hundred synthetic cmds for each cluster , using the isochrones by @xcite .",
    "the synthetic cmds were constructed by adopting for each cluster the corresponding metallicity , an age in the range between @xmath14 and @xmath30 gyr , the photometric errors ( as estimated from artificial star experiments ) , and the total number of stars in the observed cmd , and varying only the initial random number generator seed .",
    "the same procedure used to determine the to in the observed cmd ( see the explanation in the previous section ) was then applied to the synthetic diagrams .",
    "we estimated the error in the to colour and magnitude in each observed cmd as the standard deviation of all the tos measured in the corresponding synthetic diagrams .",
    "this procedure does not take into account the effects due to differential reddening .",
    "therefore the error estimated for clusters whose cmds show this effect ( namely ngc  4372 , ngc  5927 , ngc  6273 , and ngc  6544 ) is likely to be underestimated . the error on the mean of",
    "the preliminary to magnitudes for ngc  6273 ( the worst case ) is approximately a factor 2 larger than the error calculated from the synthetic diagrams .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to adopt this technique for its reliability and for consistency with @xcite .    regarding the errors on the zahb magnitude of the intermediate and metal poor clusters , they are dominated by the error in matching the hb of the template cluster with that of the object cluster , particularly for clusters with only a blue hb .",
    "as in @xcite , we repeated the fit many times , and estimated the error as the maximum difference between the single shift values and the final adopted one .",
    "this error estimate has been divided by @xmath28 , in order to have the classical 1-@xmath31 value for a gaussian distribution of the errors ( in order to make it comparable with the errors of the to magnitudes ) .",
    "for the metal rich clusters , the main source of error is the uncertainty in the position of the lower envelope , particularly in clusters with a small number of stars .    in estimating errors in the vertical parameter , we considered the errors on the zahb and to magnitudes to be independent , and thus summed in quadrature the two contributions .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the most relevant cluster parameters , including those measured in this paper , for the hst snapshot clusters .",
    "1 gives the cluster name ; col .",
    "2 and 3 give the metallicity in the zw and cg scale , respectively ; col .",
    "4 gives the galactocentric distance .",

    "9 , 10 list the vertical parameter value , in the @xmath12 band , for the snapshot clusters . table  [ tab2 ] provides the same quantities as table  [ tab1 ] , but for the groundbased clusters .",
    "the magnitudes of table  [ tab2 ] are therefore in the @xmath13-band .",
    "as already mentioned , we have used the same database @xcite used by @xcite , but for consistency reasons we decided to re - measure the vertical parameter .",
    "figure  [ confr.gbn-gba ] shows the comparison between the to and zahb magnitudes , and between the vertical parameters of the present study and those listed by @xcite for the groundbased clusters .",
    "while the to values are in very good agreement , there is some hint of a trend with the metallicity ( though it is mostly within the average measurement errors ) for the differences in zahb magnitudes in the intermediate and low metallicity range .",
    "this was expected because of the different method adopted in the two studies and the different definition of the zahb level .",
    "@xcite used the same ( empirical ) template for all the intermediate and metal poor clusters .",
    "we think that the method used in the present paper is more reliable , as it is able to better account for the differences in the hb at varying the cluster metallicities .",
    "to measure the cluster relative ages , we compared our observed vertical parameters with the theoretical counterpart obtained from the set of @xmath10-enhanced isochrones of @xcite , available in both the wfpc2/hst photometric bands , and the johnson - cousins system .    for each isochrone , the theoretical to",
    "was determined as the bluest point of the ms , and the zahb level was taken as the magnitude of the zahb model at @xmath32 .",
    "we performed a @xmath33-dimensional bicubic spline to set a finer grid in age and metallicity , and thus to give an estimate of the age for each cluster in the sample .",

    "the upper panel of each figure adopts the zw metallicity scale , whereas the lower panel refers to the cg scale .",
    "the two data sets are presented separately due to the different photometric systems .    both figures",
    "[ c04aesnap ] and [ c04aegb ] show that the mean age of the metal poor clusters is about @xmath5  gyr older than the mean age of the clusters with @xmath2}_{\\rm zw}>-1.7 $ ] ( @xmath2}_{\\rm cg}>-1.4 $ ] ) . at intermediate metallicities ( @xmath4}_{\\rm zw }",
    "< -0.8 $ ] ) , the age spread is increased by a group of a few clusters showing a younger age . this will be discussed further in the next section .    keeping in mind that the purpose of this work is to measure relative ages , and following @xcite , we calculated for each cluster a * normalised age * , defined as the ratio between the cluster age and the mean age of the group of metal poor clusters .",
    "more specifically , in case of the zw metallicity , we used as normalising factor the mean age of the clusters with @xmath2}_{\\rm zw}<-1.7 $ ] , i.e. @xmath35 gyr .",
    "for the cg metallicity scale , the normalising age is equal to @xmath36 gyr , corresponding to the mean age of the clusters with @xmath2}_{\\rm cg}<-1.4 $ ] .",

    "11 , 12 give the normalised ages , and the corresponding errors adopting the zw metallicity scale , and col .  13 , 14 the normalised ages and the corresponding errors for the cg metallicity scale .",
    "as it can be inferred from the values in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] , and as it will be discussed in section 4 , the group of clusters at intermediate metallicity shows a large age dispersion .",
    "we have verified that the age differences derived from the vertical parameter are indeed correct . in particular , we focussed our attention on a few clusters with nearly the same metallicity , within @xmath37 dex , at @xmath2}_{\\rm zw}\\sim-1.3 $ ] .",
    "some of these clusters have been the subject of a long and lively discussion in the literature in the last 10 years or so ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the attempt to establish whether they are coeval or not .",
    "according to the vertical parameter , ngc  362 , ngc  1261 , ngc  1851 , ngc  2808 , ngc  5904 have all the same age , within the uncertainties ( 5 - 8% ) , and are 10 - 15% younger than another group of older ( and coeval among them ) clusters which includes ngc  288 , ngc  5946 , ngc  6218 , ngc  6121 , ngc  6266 , ngc  6362 , ngc  6717 . in order to check this observational evidence , in figures  [ comp_ml1 ] and [ comp_ml2 ]",
    "we directly compare the hb population and the fiducial points reproducing the location of the main sequence and sub - giant branch ( sgb ) of the cmds of four couples of clusters selected among the above mentioned objects .",
    "the hb stars and the fiducial points have been shifted in magnitude in order to have the to point at magnitude 0 .",
    "one of the two clusters has been shifted in colour by the amount required to take the tos at the same colour .",
    "figure  [ comp_ml1 ] shows this comparison for two couples of nearly coeval clusters ( ngc  362 - ngc  1261 and ngc  362 - ngc  1851 ) : all the sequences match remarkably well , and it is hard to infer any age difference among these objects .",
    "these clusters were also found to be nearly coeval by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure  [ comp_ml2 ] compares two of these young clusters ( ngc  362 and ngc  1851 ) with ngc  6121 , which results older : despite the to and sgb regions match well , the hb levels significantly differ , as expected from our vertical parameters .",
    "the difference in magnitude between the hb levels is indicative of the different ages .",
    "the homogeneity of the observational database is a crucial ingredient for accurate relative age measurement . in this paper",
    ", we use two catalogues of cmds coming from rather different observational systems , with similar , but not identical bandpasses .",
    "this means that we can not directly compare the parameters obtained from the empirical cmds .",
    "even if the models used for the age determination have been appropriately transformed into the two observational systems before comparison with the observed parameters , it is important to verify that the ages coming from the two data sets are mutually consistent . for this reason",
    ", we took advantage of the @xmath1 clusters in common between the hst snapshot and the groundbased data set .",
    "figure  [ snap - gbn ] shows the difference between the ages from the snapshot and the groundbased catalogues for the common clusters .",
    "the average difference is consistent with zero , and there is no trend with the cluster metal content .",
    "figure  [ snap - gbn ] tells us that we can merge the two age catalogues , and use them together in analysing the relative ages of the galactic globular clusters .",
    "comparison with stellar models is critical for any cluster age determination . in principle , differences in the input physics ( i.e. equation of state , opacities ) input parameters ( i.e. the helium enrichment ratio @xmath38 ) and transformations from the theoretical to the observational plane , may have a significant impact on the final ages and the inferred star formation history of the galactic gc system .    to assess the consistency of our relative age determination , at least within the recent theoretical framework , we compared in fig .",
    "[ confteo ] our normalised ages for the groundbased sample with the values estimated using the two isochrone sets already employed by @xcite , i.e. the straniero , chieffi , & limongi ( 1997 ) and @xcite isochrones calculated by interpolating the evolutionary tracks by @xcite .",
    "apart from the heavy element mixture , these two sets of isochrones differ from our reference models mainly with respect to the adopted equation of state , bolometric corrections , and helium abundance at a given metallicity . about this latter point ,",
    "the models by @xcite use @xmath39 , whereas @xcite employ @xmath40 , and @xcite make use of @xmath41 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the initial he abundance ( @xmath42 ) adopted in the stellar computation has a strong effect on both the core h - burning lifetime and on the hb luminosity level .",
    "more in details , for a fixed age , when the value of @xmath42 increases , the to of the isochrone becomes fainter , whereas the hb luminosity level increases . as a consequence the value of the @xmath11 parameter increases .",
    "so for a fixed age , the adopted helium - enrichment ratio , affects the trend of the @xmath11 parameter with @xmath43 .",
    "the net effect on the age estimate is to make a cluster of a given metallicity younger when he increases .",
    "therefore , an increase of the helium - enrichment ratio enhances , if present , any age - metallicity relationship ( in the sense of making the more metal rich clusters younger in comparison with the more metal poor ones ) .",
    "given that @xcite models include a larger helium enrichment ratio with respect to @xcite , we expect that their use produces younger relative ages for the more metal rich clusters .",
    "the different helium - enrichment ratio is also the main reason for the different behaviours of the @xmath11 parameter with the metallicity at a fixed age .",
    "in addition , the @xcite models account for helium diffusion , which is neglected in the other isochrone sets .",
    "when deriving the theoretical @xmath11age@xmath2}$ ] calibration from the @xcite scaled solar isochrones , we used the property that the @xmath11 values at a given age are to a good approximation the same for both a scaled solar metal distribution and an @xmath10-enhanced one typical of gcs ( see , e.g. @xcite ) with the same metal mass fraction @xmath43 , at least for metal poor objects .",

    "the difference decreases to @xmath47% for the @xcite models , whereas the difference between our ages and those obtained using the @xcite models seems to be reversed , with the @xcite ages younger than ours by @xmath47% for the three clusters at @xmath2}\\sim-0.6 $ ] .",
    "we have also compared our normalised ages with the results obtained using the @xcite models . in this case , there is generally a better agreement between the two age sets , with some differences ( always smaller than @xmath49% ) at the two extremes of the metallicity interval covered by our data set .    despite these discrepancies , for the purposes of this paper , the comparisons in fig .",
    "[ confteo ] show that there is a substantial agreement among the ages obtained with recent stellar evolution models : the overall picture of the age distribution discussed in the next section would not change if we were to consider the normalised ages obtained from the @xcite , @xcite or @xcite models .",
    "it is the size of the trends of the average normalised ages with metallicity that would marginally change , although an agreement at the level of @xmath50% ( comparable with the observational errors ) among rather different model sets is encouraging . by contrast",
    "the trend of the age dispersion with metallicity is more solid , as it mainly depends on the dispersion of the observed parameters , and much less ( and in any case much less than the observational errors ) on the adopted models .",
    "figures [ figmna2_zw ] and [ figmna2_cg ] plot the normalised ages as a function of the metallicity , and of the distance from the galactic centre for the two adopted metallicity scales .",
    "different symbols represent the different metallicity ranges listed in the figure caption .",
    "open symbols represent the hst snapshot data , whereas filled symbols are for the groundbased clusters . for the clusters in common between the two catalogues , we plot the age obtained from the vertical parameter measured on the hst snapshot cmds .",

    "the overall trend already displayed by figures  [ c04aesnap ] and [ c04aegb ] is more easily visible in figures  [ figmna2_zw ] and [ figmna2_cg ] : the most metal poor clusters ( @xmath2}_{\\rm zw}<-1.7 $ ] , @xmath2}_{\\rm cg}<-1.4 $ ] ) are all older , and coeval , with an age dispersion smaller than @xmath3 gyr , which is compatible with a null age dispersion , if we take into account the measurement errors . the clusters with @xmath4}_{\\rm zw}<-0.8 $ ] ( @xmath52}_{\\rm cg}<-0.8 $ ] ) are , on average , @xmath5 gyr and @xmath53 gyr respectively , if the models of @xcite and @xcite are adopted . ] younger , and show a larger age dispersion ( @xmath6 gyr ) , with an age total range of @xmath54 gyr .",
    "interestingly enough , @xmath55% ( @xmath49 out of @xmath56 ) of the clusters in this metallicity interval seems to be coeval with the most metal poor ones .",
    "the age dispersion is independent of the adopted stellar evolution model .",
    "more metal rich clusters have on average the same age as the intermediate metallicity ones , but apparently with a smaller age dispersion , though the small number of objects and the differences in the ages from the different model sets ( cf . fig  [ confteo ] ) do not allow any firm conclusion for this group of clusters .",
    "there is no evidence for a dependence of age on the distance from the galactic centre , though all the clusters with @xmath57 kpc are old ( but these are all metal poor clusters ) .    in the following we consider a few peculiar objects . on average",
    ", we note that the metal poor clusters are the oldest clusters . however , among them , two clusters ( ngc  4590 and ngc  7078 ) seem to be about @xmath58% younger .",
    "interestingly enough , @xcite listed these two gcs among a group of low - metallicity clusters that display a planar alignment in the outer halo , probably the consequence of an accretion event from a galactic satellite system . on the other hand , in the same paper also ngc  7099 and ngc  5024 are indicated as members of the same group , while in our study they seem to be coeval with the remaining metal poor clusters .",
    "there are a few intermediate metallicity clusters that show a much younger age , namely ngc  362 ( the youngest of the whole sample , with an age @xmath59% younger than the zero relative age level ) , ngc  1261 , ngc  2808 , ngc  3201 and ngc  1851 .",
    "all these clusters were already known to be younger objects @xcite .",
    "figure 1 in @xcite displays the position of some galactic clusters in galactocentric coordinates indicating the position of two planes passing in the vicinity of some satellite galaxies of the milky way .",
    "ngc  1261 , ngc  2808 and ngc  1851 are located very close to the fornax - leo - sculptor plane .",
    "the galactocentric coordinates of ngc  362 and ngc  3201 can be calculated starting from the galactic coordinates ( @xmath60 ) , and the distance from the galactic centre ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in the revised version of 2003 ) : both clusters are found to be very close to the same plane .",
    "none of the clusters suspected of being members of the sagittarius stream @xcite , and present in our catalogue ( ngc  288 , ngc  4147 , ngc  5053 , ngc  5466 , ngc  5634 , ngc  7089 ) , seems to be significantly younger than the average of the other clusters with similar metallicity , though it is well established that other clusters of the same stream are definitely young , e.g. pal  12 @xcite , ruprecht 106 @xcite , terzan 7 @xcite .",
    "we presented a catalogue of homogeneous , relative ages obtained from the so called vertical parameter for a sample of galactic gcs .",
    "the analysis of the relative age distribution gives some hints on the origin of the gc system of our galaxy .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the low metallicity clusters ( @xmath2}\\leq-1.7 $ ] ) are the oldest gcs .",
    "the low metallicity clusters show a very small age dispersion ( @xmath61 gyr ) , compatible with a null age dispersion , if we account for the measurement errors . among the low - metallicity clusters",
    ", there are a couple of objects which are marginally younger .",
    "these objects are part of a suspected galactic stream , which might indicate accretion from outside the galaxy , or debris from the tidal disruption of a galactic satellite .",
    "the clusters at intermediate metallicities ( @xmath62}_{\\rm   zw}\\le-0.9 $ ] ) are up to @xmath28 gyr younger than the more metal poor ones , with an age dispersion of @xmath63 gyr .",
    "a small sample of objects ( @xmath55% ) seems to be coeval with the most metal poor gcs .",
    "it must be explicitly noted that , while the age dispersion seems to be a solid result , the dependence of the _ mean _ age on metallicity and its value are model dependent .",
    "the empirical facts outlined above imply that most of the gcs with @xmath2}_{\\rm zw}\\ge-1.7 $ ] were born between @xmath64 and @xmath51 gyr after a first generation of more metal poor clusters .",
    "a few of the intermediate metallicity clusters are up to @xmath28 gyr younger than the oldest clusters in the same metallicity range and this last result is not model dependent .",
    "interestingly enough , all these young clusters seem to be related to some galactic streams , i.e. linked to some tidal disruption event ( of an external object or a smaller satellite ) , though these streams contain also some of the oldest known gcs .    finally , all the metal rich clusters are at least @xmath51 gyr younger than the most metal poor ones , with a relatively small age dispersion .",
    "the metal rich sample is still too poor , however , to enable firmer conclusions to be reached .",
    "we do not see any correlation of the cluster ages with the galactocentric distance",
    ". however , all the clusters with galactocentric distances greater than @xmath65 kpc are old , with a very small age dispersion .",
    "these clusters are also in the metal poor sample .    in concluding this paper ,",
    "it is worth adding a final remark .",
    "other parameters , as helium variations , @xmath46}$ ] differences , cluster to cluster deep mixing ( due to internal rotation ) affect the vertical separation between the to and the zahb . we have already commented the effect of he - enrichment as a function of metallicity in section 3.3 . here , we note that there is no evidence of significant cluster to cluster he variations , as shown by salaris et al .",
    "( 2004 ) using our snapshot database .",
    "however , recent results on the massive clusters @xmath66 centauri ( bedin et al .",
    "2004 , piotto et al . 2005 ) and ngc 2808 ( dantona & caloi 2004 ) indicates that within the same cluster , there could be two generations of stars , with the second generation being helium enriched . if this occurrence is confirmed , and if the same scenario is present also in less massive clusters , the ages derived from the vertical parameter could be affected . as for the other parameters",
    ", we plotted our relative ages as a function of @xmath46}$ ] for the clusters for which this parameter has been measured , and we did not find any correlation .",
    "the effect of deep mixing variations is at the moment impossible to assess from the observational point of view . in conclusion , the main parameter able to explain our measured vertical parameter variations , at least inside the metallicity bins of figures  [ figmna2_zw ] and [ figmna2_cg ] is still age .",
