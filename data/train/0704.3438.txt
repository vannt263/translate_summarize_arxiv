    "our knowledge of the spectral properties of the prompt emission of long gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) is based on systematic studies of their time integrated spectrum ( e.g. golenetskii et al . , 1983 ; band et al . 1993 ; barraud et al . 2003 ;",
    "amati et al . 2002 ) which turned out to be described by two smoothly joint s with typical photon indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the low and high energy components , respectively , or a cutoff .",
    "several studies aiming to characterise the time dependent behaviour of the spectrum ( ford et al . 1995 ; preece et al .",
    "1997 ; crider et al .",
    "1997 ; ghirlanda , celotti & ghisellini 2002 , ryde et al .",
    "2000 ; kaneko et al .",
    "2006 ) have demonstrated that the overall spectral shape and the peak energy @xmath6 ( in a @xmath7 plot ) evolve in time .",
    "the evolution is rather complex and there is no unique trend , but a prevalence of a hard  to  soft behaviour is observed .    the time integrated properties , however , are the one used to calculate the bolometric emitted energy of grbs ( both isotropic , @xmath3 , and collimation corrected , @xmath8 ) and to relate them to the peak energy @xmath1 ( the so called  amati \" ,  ghirlanda \" and  liang & zhang \" relations ",
    "amati et al .",
    "2002 ; ghirlanda , ghisellini & lazzati 2004 , hereafter ggl04 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2007 ; liang & zhang 2005 ) . furthermore ,",
    "even the correlation between the isotropic peak luminosity @xmath9 and @xmath1 ( the so  called  yonetoku \" relation  yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the @xmath9@xmath1@xmath10 relation ( the so  called  firmani \" relation  firmani et al . 2006 ) make use of the time integrated spectrum ( see ghirlanda et al .",
    "the fact that these correlations apply to the time integrated spectrum , even if it evolves in time , may underline some global property of the burst .    in this respect",
    "there have been , very recently , important suggestions and new ideas for explaining the  amati \" , the  ghirlanda \" and also the  firmani \" relation .",
    "the simplest way to have a relation between the emitted energy or luminosity and @xmath1 is through  emission .",
    "indeed , in this case , the number of free parameters is kept to a minimum : the rest frame bolometric and isotropic  luminosity would depend on the emitting surface , the temperature and the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "any other emission process would depend on some extra parameters , such as the magnetic field and/or the particle density , and it would then be more difficult , if these quantities vary from burst to burst , to produce a correlation with a relatively small scatter such as the  one .",
    "rees &  ( 2005 ) , thompson ( 2006 ) and thompson ,  & rees ( 2006 ) explain these correlations assuming that a considerable fraction of the prompt emission flux is due to a black  body .",
    "this does not imply , however , that the entire observed flux is a single black ",
    "body ( we already know that this is not the case ) .",
    "indeed , time integrated grb spectra are typically described by the band model or cutoff  power law model .",
    "the time integrated spectrum , however , being the result of the spectral evolution , could be best fitted by a model which is not the same used for the time resolved spectra . within the black  body interpretation",
    ", there could be at least two alternatives : the time integrated spectrum ( which looks like a cutoff  power law or a band model ) is ( a ) the result of the superposition of different black  bodies with a time dependent temperature and flux or ( b ) the sum of two components , i.e. one thermal ( black  body ) and one non  thermal ( power law or double power law ) as suggested by ryde 2004 . in both cases , since the temperature of the single ( time resolved ) black  bodies and/or the slope of the  can evolve in time , the time  integrated spectrum",
    "could well be modelled by a smoothly broken  ( i.e. the band function , see below ) , hiding the presence of the black  body .",
    "this requires to perform the time resolved spectral analysis in order to assess the presence of an evolving black  body component possibly with a non  thermal  component .",
    "evidences of the presence of a thermal  component were discovered in the batse spectra ( e.g. ghirlanda , celotti , ghisellini 2003 , hereafter gcg03 ) .",
    "this component dominates the initial emission phase up to @xmath11 s after the trigger . during this phase the luminosity and the temperature evolve similarly in different grbs while the late time spectrum is dominated by a non thermal component ( e.g. it is fitted with the empirical band et al . 1993 model ) .",
    "attempts to deconvolve these spectra with a mixed model , i.e. a  plus a ( ryde et al . 2005 ) , showed that the  ( albeit with a monotonically decreasing flux ) could be present also during later phases of the prompt emission ( see also bosnjak et al .",
    "2005 ) .    as a test of the recently proposed `` black  body '' interpretations of the  and  correlations , we consider , among the sample of grbs used to define these correlations , those bursts that were detected by batse and",
    "with published wfc spectra .",
    "given the relatively large brightness of these bursts , it is possible for them to meaningfully analyse the time dependent properties of their spectra .",
    "the focus of this paper is not much on the study of the spectral evolution of these few bursts , but , instead , on the relevance of the  in the time resolved spectra together with the relevance of the sum of the black  bodies , possibly at different temperatures , in the time integrated spectrum . to this aim",
    "we adopt for our analysis a +  model , besides the `` standard '' band and cutoff  model .",
    "we anticipate that the +  model , although giving acceptable fits , is inconsistent with the wfc data .",
    "a more complex fit , made by adopting the sum of a and a cutoff , is equally acceptable and consistent with the wfc data , but implies that the  flux is a minor fraction of the total .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in  2 we recall the basic ideas of the `` black  body '' interpretation of the  and  correlations ; in  3 we introduce the sample and the spectral analysis procedure ; in  3 we present the results of the time resolved spectral analysis and the comparison of the batse and wfc spectra with the three adopted model .",
    "we discuss our results in  4 .",
    "the recent theoretical attempts to explain the spectral  energy relations , and in particular the  ( amati ) one , largely motivate the present work . therefore it may be useful to summarise here the arguments put forward by thompson ( 2006 ) and by thompson ,  & rees ( 2006 ) .    consider a fireball that at some distance @xmath12 from the central engine is moving relativistically with bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 . as an example , one can think that @xmath12 is the radius of the progenitor star .",
    "assume that a large fraction of the energy that the fireball dissipates at @xmath12 is thermalized and forms a  of luminosity : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the temperatures at @xmath12 in the comoving and observing frame , respectively .",
    "the collimation corrected luminosity is @xmath17 , which , for small semiaperture angles of the jetted fireball ( assumed to be conical ) gives @xmath18 now thompson ( 2006 ) and thompson ,   & rees ( 2006 ) introduce one key assumption : for causality reasons @xmath19 .",
    "this allows to substitute @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) to obtain : @xmath20",
    "setting @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the duration of the prompt emission , one has @xmath24 this reproduces the  amati \" relation if @xmath25 is nearly the same in different bursts and if the dispersion of the grb duration is not large .",
    "one can see that a key assumption for this derivation is the black  body law .",
    "it is the @xmath26 relation which allows to derive @xmath27 .",
    "we consider all bursts detected by batse with measured spectroscopic redshift which were also detected by  and for which the wfc data were published ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ; frontera , amati & costa 2000 ) . in tab .",
    "1 we list our bursts and their time integrated spectral properties as found in the literature .",
    "we also report the duration ( @xmath28 ) derived from the batse @xmath29ray light curve , the 50300 kev energy fluence and the hard x  ray ( 228 kev ) energy fluence .",
    "we include in our sample also grb 980329 and 980326 for which only a range of possible redshifts ( the most accurate for 980326 ) were found ( see also ggl04 ) .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab2 ]      the results obtained from the time resolved analysis of the grbs of our sample indicate that the fit with a +  model gives acceptable results for all bursts .",
    "this model has also the advantage , with respect to the band and the cutoff  model , to require a soft  component with a spectral index always consistent ( except for grb 990123 ) with a cooling particle distribution ( i.e. @xmath30 ) . in fig .",
    "[ confalfa ] we compare the photon index of the cpl model ( which is in most cases consistent with @xmath31 of the b model ) to that the bbpl model . note that the latter is always softer than the corresponding parameter of the cpl model . in the same plot",
    "we also mark the synchrotron limits and show that the  of the bbpl model is consistent with these limits being ( except for grb 990123 ) softer than @xmath32 . also when considering the time integrated spectra we find that the  component of the bbpl model is systematically softer than the  components of the b or cpl model ( compare col . 7 and col . 3 in tab .",
    "the peak energy @xmath1 resulting from fitting the data with the bbpl model is indeed produced by the  component which substantially contributes to the total energetics , at least in the observed energy range of .",
    "this would thus favour the   interpretation \" of the spectral  energy correlation which we have summarised in sec .",
    "2 .    however , these results are based on the spectral analysis of the   spectra only .",
    "although covering two orders of magnitude in energy , these data do not extend below 20 kev and above 2000 kev .",
    "the low energy limit is particularly relevant here , since for these bursts we do have the information of the low ( 228 kev ) energy emission from the wfc of .",
    "we can then compare the result of the bbpl model with the flux and spectrum observed by the wfc .",
    "since the latter concerns the time integrated spectrum , we should then either add the single time resolved spectra to construct the total flux and spectrum for each burst , or use the result obtained fitting the   time integrated spectrum .",
    "in both cases we have to extrapolate the model to the energy range of the wfc .    as stated above , the inclusion of the  component implies that the accompanying  component becomes soft ( i.e. @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is this  component that mainly contributes at low energies , and we find , in all cases , a strong disagreement between the extrapolated flux and spectrum of the wfc data .",
    "this is shown in figg .",
    "[ 971214wfc ] , [ 980326wfc ] , [ 980329wfc ] , [ 980425wfc ] , [ 990123wfc ] , [ 990510wfc ] , where we report the batse time integrated spectrum and the wfc spectrum . in the three panels of these figures",
    "we report the results of the fit with the three models described in sec . 3 , i.e. the band model ( b ) , the cutoff  model ( cpl ) and the composite model ( black  body plus   bbpl ) .",
    "we report both the model fit to the time integrated spectrum ( solid line ) to the time resolved spectra ( dotted lines ) and the sum of the time resolved model fits ( dot  dashed line ) .",
    "one can see that in all cases the bbpl model strongly overpredicts the observed flux in the wfc 228 kev energy band , with a slope which is much softer than observed .",
    "this occurs both when we sum the time resolved spectra and when we use the time integrated fits . on the contrary , note the excellent agreement of the extrapolated flux and the wfc data in the case of the b and the cpl fits .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first time that a detailed comparison of the wfc @xmath0sax and the  data is performed .",
    "we conclude that they are in excellent agreement _ if the spectrum is indeed described by the band or cpl model , and that the bbpl model can not reproduce the wfc data .",
    "_    we can also conclude that a fit with a  only ( without the ) is never consistent with the data , even when considering spectra at the peak of the light curve or for the first phases of the emission .",
    "this is because fitting the cpl model , which can mimic a  when @xmath34 , always gives @xmath35 .",
    "our analysis also shows that the black  body component in the time resolved spectra that we have analyzed ( typically with @xmath360.1 s time resolution ) does not change much during the burst .",
    "this implies that even if it were possible to perform the spectral analysis with a finer temporal resolution , it is unlikely that the time resolved spectra are the superposition of a multi  temperature black  body .",
    "finally , we can not exclude the possibility that the _ istantaneous _ spectrum is produced by a superposition of black  body components .",
    "indeed , this is exactly what happens in thermal or quasi  thermal comptonization models ( if the seed photons have a relatively narrow range of frequencies ) , where the superposition of different scattering orders ( each one being black  body like ) produces the cut  off power law spectrum . black ",
    "body components produced in different ( and independent ) emitting regions , instead , are less likely , since some fine tuning is required in order to produce the smooth observed spectrum .",
    "the existence and the relevance of a  component in the spectra of our grbs can be further tested allowing for the possibility that the real spectral model is more complicated than what we thought .",
    "we could make the +  model fits consistent with the wfc [ 228 kev ] spectra by introducing a spectral break between the batse and the wfc energy ranges",
    ". this could indeed be the case if the non  thermal component is produced by an electron energy distribution with a low energy cutoff , or if the apparently non  thermal component is instead the result of a thermal comptonization process ( e.g. liang 1997 ; liang et al .",
    "1997 ; ghisellini & celotti 1999 ; meszaros & rees 2000 ) . in the latter case what we see in the wfc could be the ( hard ) spectrum of the seed photons , while in batse we may see the sum of the comptonization spectrum and a .",
    "we must then check if , in this case , it is possible that a  is present , is responsible for a significant fraction of the total flux and for the observed @xmath1 , without violating any observational constraint .",
    "if so , then the `` '' interpretation presented in  2 would receive support .    however , there are severe problems with this possibility .",
    "the first is that the required break should always be at @xmath3730 kev ( between the batse and the wfc energy ranges ) despite the fact that our grbs have different redshifts .",
    "this makes this possibility rather ad hoc .",
    "the second problem comes from the following test .",
    "as stated , we should use a model composed by  plus a band spectrum .",
    "this model , unfortunately , has too many free parameters to yield strong constraints , but we can mimic it by adopting a model composed by the sum of a  and cutoff . the index of the latter should be thought as the low energy index of the band model .",
    "furthermore , since what we really put on test is the presence of a relevant , we can also fix its temperature requiring it to give the @xmath1 found when using the cpl ( or b ) model .",
    "this is because we already know that are these @xmath1 , when combined in the time integrated spectrum , that give the @xmath1 used for the amati and ghirlanda correlations .",
    "we thus use this + cutoff  model ( bbcpl ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , i.e the black body characteristic temperature , is fixed so that 3.9@xmath39=@xmath1 ( as found from the fit of the cpl model to each time resolved spectrum ) .",
    "this model has the same number of free parameters of the bbpl and b model ( the two normalisations , @xmath40 and @xmath31 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ confalfa1 ] we compare the photon index found with a simple cpl model and the @xmath31 of the bbcpl model described above . in the bbcpl model",
    "the photon index of the cpl component can fit the wfc data and indeed we found it to be consistent with the values found by the fit of a simple cpl model .",
    "_ instead , the  component is negligible in all these fits . _",
    "for each time resolved spectrum fitted with the bbcpl model we can compute the fraction of the rest frame bolometric flux contributed by the   component . summing up these contributions for the entire duration of each burst we derive the contribution of the  to the time integrated flux .",
    "the values are reported in tab .",
    "2 ( last column ) : for all the bursts this contribution is small .",
    "we can then conclude that if a  is present , with a temperature consistent with the peak of the spectrum ( found by fitting the cpl model ) then its flux is not relevant . consider also that this spectral model is not required by the data , which are instead well described by the simpler cpl ( or b ) model . in this sense",
    "what we found is an _ upper limit _ to the possible contribution of a  to the total flux .",
    "we have analysed the spectra of 7 grbs detected by batse with measured redshift and for which also the  wfc spectrum has been published ( amati et al .",
    "we analysed both the time resolved and the time integrated spectrum with three models : the band model ( b ) , a cutoff  model ( cpl ) and a +  model ( bbpl ) . for a further test of the importance of a possible  component",
    "we have also used the sum of a  plus a cutoff  model ( bbcpl ) .",
    "the comparison of the spectral parameters and the analysis of the spectral evolution has shown that :    * the time resolved spectra could be reasonably fitted with all models .",
    "the spectral parameters of the b and cpl model agree within their uncertainties ; * in all our grbs the spectral slope of the low energy component of the b or cpl model violate both the optically thin synchrotron limit with ( @xmath41 ) or without ( @xmath42 ) radiative cooling ; * the values of @xmath35 found from the fit of the cpl model exclude the possibility that a single  model can fit these spectra ( as the   coincides with the cpl model only for @xmath34 ) ; * the  slope of the bbpl model is softer than the corresponding parameter of the b or cpl model . in most grbs ( except grb 990123 )",
    "this component is softer than the optically thin  limit with cooling ( @xmath41 ) and softens as time goes by ; * the peak energies of the  component of the bbpl model found here are similar to the values found for a few other bursts analysed with the bbpl model ( ryde et al .",
    "2005 ) or with a single  component ( gcg03 ) ; * the  flux ( in the bbpl model ) is no more than 50% of the total flux and it changes with time . in these bursts",
    "the   does not dominate the initial emission phase as was the case of the few grbs analysed by gcg03 ; * the soft  spectra found using the bbpl model implies a relatively large flux of the spectrum extrapolated at lower energies .",
    "this extrapolation is inconsistent with the wfc data and spectra ( figg .",
    "[ 971214wfc ] , [ 980326wfc ] , [ 980329wfc ] , [ 980425wfc ] , [ 990123wfc ] , [ 990510wfc ] ) ; * the time integrated spectral fit and the sum of the time resolved spectral fits with either the b and cpl model are consistent with the wfc spectrum both in terms of flux and slope ; * fitting the  spectra with the bbcpl model results in a cutoff  component whose extrapolation to the wfc energy range is consistent with the observed spectrum in terms of flux and slope . in this case , however , the  flux is not significant .",
    "the most important results of this work is the assessment of the importance of a  component in the spectra of grbs . for the grbs analysed here",
    ", we find that it can not be , at the same time , responsible for the peak ( in @xmath2 ) of the spectrum and for its total energetics .",
    "we could reach this conclusion by analysing the time resolved spectra of those grbs detected by  and the by the wfc of , therefore using the energy range between 2 kev and 2 mev .",
    "we also find that the  data , fitted by a cutoff  or by the band model , are entirely consistent with the wfc data .",
    "these findings bear important consequences on the interpretation of the peak  energy correlations ( including the amati , the ghirlanda , and the firmani correlations ) put forward recently by thompson ( 2006 ) and by thompson , meszaros & rees ( 2007 ) .",
    "this interpretation requires that the  component is responsible for the peak energy @xmath1 and for a significant fraction of the bolometric emitted energy .",
    "note that , since the temperature of the  component may vary in time , the time integrated spectrum may not be particularly revealing of the  presence , making a time resolved analysis mandatory .    one may argue that the spectrum is even more complex than what we thought , having an additional break and becoming harder at low energies .",
    "such a break is expected if the spectrum is due to a thermal photospheric emission ( the  component ) superimposed to non  thermal emission due to some dissipative mechanism ( meszaros & rees 2000 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the observed spectra result from multiple compton up  scattering of soft seed photons ( e.g. ghiselllini & celotti 1999 ; thompson 2005 ) .",
    "in such a case a break is expected between the ( possibly ) hard seed photon spectrum and the beginning of the comptonized spectrum .",
    "but even by fitting the spectra with a more complex model allowing for this break , we found that the  component is not relevant .",
    "this , together with the rather ad hoc requirement to have a break always at 30 kev ( observed ) irrespective of the different redshifts of our grbs , lead us to conclude that the presence of relevant   in the spectrum of our grbs is to be excluded .",
    "this in turn , makes more problematic ( and mysterious ) the interpretation of the spectral  energy correlation in long grbs .",
