    "the bicep2 experiment @xcite has detected the b - modes of polarization in the cosmic microwave background . and this observed b - modes power spectrum gives the constraint to the tensor - to - scalar ratio with @xmath13 at the @xmath14 level of the lensed-@xmath15cdm model @xcite . and the tensor spectral tilt @xmath5 can be obtained , when the first oder consistency relation , @xmath16 , was respected . also ,",
    "relaxing this consistency relation by taking @xmath5 as a free model parameter @xcite , @xmath17 and @xmath18 were obtained by using bicep2 only . by combining _ planck _ , wmap9 and bao data , it was already found that a blue tilt is slightly favored , but it is still well consistent with flat or red tilt @xcite .",
    "however , one can go further by taking generalized parameterized forms of scalar and tensor mode power spectra as @xmath19 without assuming any idea about inflation , in other words throwing away the consistence relations , just considering the possible deviation from the scale invariant power spectra , i.e. the harrison - zeldovich - peebles spectra . and",
    "how to interpreter it is another issue .",
    "of course , one can relate it to the so - called inflation , where the consistence relations should be respected . and in this way , one can test the viability of inflation models .",
    "but , one can also explain it through the bounce expansion .",
    "here @xmath20 and @xmath5 are tilts of power spectrum of scalar and tensor modes , @xmath21 is the pivot scale , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the running of the scalar and tensor spectral tilts .",
    "the primordial tensor - to - scalar ratio is defined by @xmath24 at different pivot scale , here , they are @xmath25 defined at @xmath21 and @xmath26 defined at @xmath27 . in this paper , without any other specification , @xmath26 will be donated by @xmath28 .",
    "and we also denote @xmath29 as the amplitude ratio of the tensor and scalar mode power spectrum at @xmath30 , i.e. the scale independent tensor - to - scalar ratio . in our calculation ,",
    "adiabatic initial conditions were assumed in this paper . actually , if one wants to relate the parameterized primordial power spectra , the following relations , the so - called consistency relation should be respected @xcite @xmath31 by taking these parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath4 as free ones , one can test these consistency relation by the recently released bicep2 data .    here",
    ", we are mainly focusing on the model parameters which are related to the primordial power spectra . therefore , in this brief paper , by combing the following data sets , we report the constrained results on the interested parameters :    \\(i ) the newly released bicep2 cmb b - mode data @xcite .",

    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "to study the effect of the spectral tilt @xmath5 and the amplitude @xmath4 to the b - mode of cmb power spectrum , we use the newest version of * camb * @xcite code where the the running @xmath45 , @xmath46 and amplitude @xmath4 as free mdomel parameters have been included in the forms of the equations ( [ eq : ps ] ) and ( [ eq : pt ] ) . by fixing the other relevant cosmological model parameters but varying @xmath5 or @xmath4 , we show the b - mode of cmb power spectrum in figure [ fig : bmode ] for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 , where the other relevant model parameters were fixed to their values obtained by _ planck _ 2013 collaboration group @xcite .",
    "one can clearly see that the variation of values of @xmath4 corresponds to move the b - mode power spectrum along the vertical direction and almost keep the shape untouched . and",
    "larger values have large amplitude of the b - mode power spectrum as expected . on the contrast , the values of @xmath5 manages the shapes at the low multipoles @xmath47 .",
    "large values of @xmath5 will decrease the amplitude of the b - mode cmb power spectrum .",
