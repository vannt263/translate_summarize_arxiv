    "exact black hole solutions to einstein s equations are notoriously difficult to find . in recent years",
    "remarkable progress has been made in five dimensions , starting with the important work of @xcite on weyl solutions .",
    "this classification inspired the discovery of the black ring @xcite , an exact solution describing a black hole with horizon topology @xmath1 (  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "subsequently , for vacuum gravity , the existence of more systematic techniques has led to the construction of a number of new solutions .",
    "in particular , the belinsky - zhakarov method @xcite , which employs ideas from integrable systems such as inverse - scattering , has been exploited to find many novel black hole configurations .",
    "these methods have been used to construct a generalization of the black ring that carries two independent angular momenta @xcite , the ` black saturn ' @xcite ( a multi - black hole solution consisting of a rotating black ring with a spinning black hole at its centre ) and other solutions with multiple horizons such as the di - ring @xcite , the bi - ring @xcite , .",
    "the recent reviews @xcite summarize our current understanding of higher dimensional black holes .",
    "unfortunately such techniques do not extend beyond five spacetime dimensions , if one is interested in stationary asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "this is due to the fact that these techniques rely on the integrability of einstein s equations when restricted to @xmath2-dimensional stationary spacetimes with a spatial @xmath3 symmetry group . for @xmath4",
    "this coincides with the dimension of the maximal abelian rotational group ( which must be a subgroup of @xmath5 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath6 this is too much ( abelian ) symmetry to describe a localized object . as a result ,",
    "very little is known about higher dimensional asymptotically flat black hole solutions . in particular , the only exact black hole solutions known in the vacuum are the myers - perry ( mp ) black holes @xcite which have a spherical horizon topology .",
    "therefore black hole non - uniqueness still remains to be proved for @xmath6 ; however , see @xcite for compelling arguments for non - uniqueness .",
    "moreover , one expects other possible horizon topologies to exist ; in particular , higher dimensional versions of black rings , , black holes with horizon topology @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , in the analysis of balanced black rings of @xcite it is argued that such solutions exist .",
    "further , the recent perturbative analysis of @xcite constructs approximate solutions and infers properties of the ` phase diagram ' to argue for non - uniqueness in dimensions @xmath8 with one non - zero angular momentum .",
    "it is of course well known that a useful tool to aid construction of exact solutions to einstein s equations is supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , the exploration of supersymmetric black holes / branes has a rich history and in recent years the systematic classification programme has led to the discovery of many interesting new solutions @xcite .",
    "a supersymmetric black hole is necessarily extremal .",
    "it has emerged that in fact it is this latter property which is responsible for the black hole attractor mechanism ( , @xcite for a review of recent developments in this area ) .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the near - horizon limit of an extremal black hole in @xmath4 always has an @xmath0 symmetry group @xcite .. ] while vacuum black holes can never be supersymmetric , they can be extremal ( , extremal kerr in four dimensions ) . therefore , a natural simplifying assumption to study higher dimensional vacuum black holes is to focus on extremal solutions .",
    "this will be the strategy employed in this paper .",
    "one might be concerned that the assumption of extremality is too strong to reveal any interesting aspects of black hole solutions in higher dimensions . in five dimensions , where we have exact solutions ,",
    "this is not the case ",
    "one still has both topologically spherical black holes and black rings .",
    "in particular , the known extremal vacuum black holes consist of the extremal mp solution ( which must have two non - zero angular momenta ) as well an extremal black ring ( which also must have two non - zero angular momenta ) .",
    "curiously , black hole uniqueness is not actually violated for these extremal solutions , in contrast to the non - extremal case @xcite . in any case",
    "the restriction to extremal black holes is not overly constraining .",
    "another motivation for studying extremal , non - supersymmetric black holes , comes from the fact that recently there has been progress in providing exact microscopic counting of their entropy @xcite .",
    "symmetry in the near - horizon limit ( subsequently proved in @xcite ) has been used to establish an attractor mechanism for rotating extremal black holes in @xmath4 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . ]    in five dimensions , it turns out that the near - horizon geometry of the vacuum extremal black ring is isometric to a special case of the near - horizon geometry of the boosted kerr - string @xcite ( the boost is such that the string is tensionless ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that this is a statement regarding _ exact solutions _ to the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "the usual relation between boosted black strings and black rings occurs only in the limit of large thin rings .",
    "this is due to the obvious qualitative expectation that a large thin ring locally `` looks like '' a black string .",
    "however , the statement about near - horizon geometries of the extremal solutions is actually valid at the full non - linear level .",
    "it is this intriguing connection which we will exploit to make progress in higher dimensions .",
    "one of our results will be to give the explicit near - horizon geometries of the general extremal mp black holes in @xmath6 and the boosted mp black string in @xmath9 .",
    "these solutions possess the typical @xmath0 symmetry which occurs for @xmath4 black holes @xcite .",
    "spatial sections of the horizon of the mp string near - horizon geometry are of @xmath10 topology , thus providing a candidate black ring near - horizon geometry in higher dimensions .",
    "indeed , we argue that the near - horizon geometry of the mp black string is isometric to that of an asymptotically flat extremal black ring in @xmath9 spacetime dimensions , provided one takes a particular value for the boost parameter .",
    "this value must be such that the mp string is tensionless .",
    "our construction only works in odd dimensions , since a @xmath11 dimensional mp solution times a line has the correct number of abelian symmetries to describe an asymptotically flat black object with a compactly generated horizon in @xmath12 dimensions ( this is not the case for an odd dimensional mp black holes ) .    to support this proposal",
    "we will also prove a technical result regarding the symmetries of near - horizon geometries of @xmath6 dimensional black holes .",
    "we expect that the @xmath0 symmetry which occurs for @xmath4 black holes generalizes to higher dimensional black holes .",
    "however , this general statement seems difficult to prove . as a step towards this we establish",
    "that , in the special case where the rotational symmetry group is enhanced to @xmath13 ( in @xmath14 dimensions ) or @xmath15 ( in @xmath16 dimensions ) , one must have an @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the proof directly generalizes the one used in @xmath4 @xcite , and uses dynamical information ( , certain components of the ricci tensor must vanish ) .",
    "the result is valid for vacuum solutions ( even with a cosmological constant ) and we expect it can be generalized to include matter as was done in @xmath4 .",
    "such an enhancement of rotational symmetry typically occurs when one is dealing with black holes with equal angular momenta in even dimensions , or all but one angular momenta equal in odd dimensions .",
    "the identification of the near - horizon of the black ring in odd @xmath17 will be incomplete unless we can use it to provide a detailed analysis of the physical parameters of the solution .",
    "the general picture of the attractor mechanism would suggest that we should be able to recover all the conserved charges from the near - horizon geometry @xcite . as we discuss this expectation is not true in general ; one needs more information than the near - horizon geometry to identify the conserved quantities of a black hole solution .",
    "we will clarify exactly what data one should expect to be able to compute from a near - horizon geometry .",
    "for example , obtaining the mass requires knowledge of the asymptotic stationary killing field , which is not contained in the near - horizon geometry .",
    "likewise knowledge of the asymptotic stationary frame is required to identify the angular velocities of the black hole / ring .",
    "while this presents an obstacle to identifying the physical parameters of the putative extremal black rings in @xmath6 , we argue that it is nevertheless possible to deduce the necessary quantities by employing extra information at hand .",
    "for instance , to determine the mass we use knowledge of the mass of the corresponding mp string .",
    "we are able to recover certain components of the conserved angular momenta from the near - horizon geometry , , the components orthogonal ( at asymptotic infinity ) to the @xmath18 of the ring .",
    "however , the angular momentum along the @xmath18 is not as straightforward .",
    "there is an important difference between a black ring and a black string ",
    "the former carries angular momentum , while the latter carries linear momentum .",
    "heuristically , one must  fold \" the latter ( in the thin ring limit ) to convert it to a black ring . here",
    "we encounter a crucial issue ; the direction along the string is not necessarily the @xmath18 direction of the ring . to complete the specification of the physical parameters ,",
    "we need to infer some aspects regarding the asymptotic geometry , in particular , the plane in which the ring rotates .",
    "using the fact that thin black rings look like black strings , we argue that in @xmath6 certain regularity conditions force the direction along the string to be the same as the direction along the ring .",
    "this allows us to complete the determination of all the physical parameters of the extremal black rings .",
    "based on this identification we present results for the phase diagram of these solutions in various dimensions .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : we begin in with a general analysis of near - horizon geometries for extremal solutions .",
    "apart from proving ( under certain restrictions ) that the near - horizon geometry has an enhanced symmetry , we present examples of vacuum near - horizon geometries in @xmath6 and we also discuss in detail the parameters we can extract from the knowledge of the near - horizon geometry alone . in we discuss properties of extremal mp black holes in various dimensions focusing on the `` moduli space '' of extremal solutions .",
    "we extend this analysis to extremal mp black strings in . in",
    "we discuss the known extremal doubly spinning black ring . in",
    "we argue that we have the exact near - horizon geometries of the yet to be found asymptotically flat extremal black rings in @xmath9 and analyze their physical properties .",
    "finally , we conclude in with a discussion . in",
    "we collect some technical details that are useful in extracting the near - horizon geometries of known extremal solutions .",
    "we begin in by introducing a useful coordinate chart valid in the neighbourhood of the event horizon of a stationary black hole solution : the _ gaussian null coordinates _ @xcite .",
    "we will then prove in a general result regarding the symmetries of near - horizon geometries in higher than five dimensions .",
    "following this technical result , we will present the near - horizon metrics for mp black holes and black - strings in and as examples of near - horizon geometries with spherical and ring - like topology .",
    "finally , in we discuss what physical quantities can be expected to be extracted from the knowledge of a near - horizon geometry alone . a short word on notation : we will use @xmath2 to denote the total spacetime dimension for black rings and black strings and @xmath19 to denote the dimension of the black holes used to construct the strings , so that @xmath20 . for convenience , we will also use a variable @xmath21 , related to the spacetime dimension by @xmath22 .      in the neighbourhood of the event horizon of a stationary black hole",
    "one can introduce coordinates @xmath23 such that the metric takes the form @xcite : ds^2= r f(r , x ) dv^2 + 2 dv dr+ 2r h_a(r , x)dvdx^a + _ ab(r , x ) dx^a dx^b .",
    "[ bhnhc ] the horizon is located at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a killing field normal to the horizon .",

    "the surface gravity of the horizon is given by @xmath30 by definition , an extremal black hole is one with vanishing surface gravity .",
    "therefore , assuming analyticity , it follows that @xmath31 ; this implies @xmath32 . from this",
    "it follows that the horizon is an infinite proper distance from any point outside the black hole .",
    "this allows us to zoom into the vicinity of the horizon in a particular way and define a consistent near - horizon limit ; the limiting geometry explicitly solves einstein s equations @xcite .    for an extremal black hole",
    "one may define the near - horizon limit by : @xmath33 , @xmath34 where we take @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting geometry ( in the rescaled coordinates ) is : ds^2= r^2 f(x ) dv^2 + 2 dvdr + 2 r h_a(x ) dvdx^a + _",
    "ab(x ) dx^a dx^b [ nhgeom ] where @xmath36 , and will be referred to as the near - horizon geometry of the black hole .",
    "it is guaranteed to solve the same equations of motion as the full black hole solution ( since it is just a well - defined limit of the original metric ) .",
    "we should emphasize that the near - horizon limit only exists because @xmath32 ( , from the extremality condition ) .",
    "similar scalings do not exist for the non - extremal solutions , although we note that if @xmath37 then to leading order  near \" the horizon ( , for small @xmath38 ) one has ds^2 ~-2 r dv^2 + 2dv dr + 2rh_a(x ) dv dx^a + _ ab(x ) dx^a dx^b .",
    "[ nonextnh ] the first two terms are rindler space written in @xmath39 coordinates , which is familiar from studies of black hole thermodynamics . however , observe that the metric is not a solution of the field equations as it is not obtained via a limit of a sequence of metrics , but rather just truncating the taylor expansion in @xmath38 of the metric coefficients .",

    "the rest of this section will be dedicated to the proof of this assertion .",
    "readers interested in the physical aspects of the extremal solutions can jump directly to the examples discussed in .    for the sake of generality , consider horizons @xmath27 equipped with a metric @xmath59 with an isometry group @xmath60 whose orbits are generically cohomogeneity-1 @xmath61 ( torus ) fibrations over a homogeneous space @xmath62 .",

    "the angular momenta for the extremal ring can be written in terms of the kerr - string parameters : [ 5dringj ] j_= ( + 2a ) , j_= a^2 leading to = 1+>3 .",
    "therefore the constraint on the parameters @xmath381 is exactly equivalent to the lower bound of @xmath382 of the ring .",
    "this provides a simple interpretation for the bounds on these parameters , as a black ring in asymptotically flat space needs a non - zero angular momentum along the ring to support it from collapsing .",
    "this is in contrast to a black string which may have arbitrarily small momentum along the string direction .",
    "thus , we have shown how the restriction on the parameters of the near - horizon geometry both originate from properties of asymptotically flat black holes .",

    "note that this necessarily must contain information regarding how one can match the near - horizon geometry to flat space at asymptopia .",
    "although certain physical properties can be computed from the near - horizon geometry alone , as argued earlier , quantities like the mass can not in general .",
    "however , here we note that all the physical quantities of the extremal black ring are identical to those of the corresponding kerr - string once ( [ psiphi ] ) is taken into account ( , they do not receive @xmath383 corrections to all orders ) .",
    "explicitly , the mass and angular velocities of the extremal black ring written in terms of the string parameters are : @xmath384 in fact the mass @xmath66 , @xmath385 , @xmath386 do not actually depend on the coordinate change ( [ psiphi ] ) . the fact that the angular momenta match is not a surprise ,",
    "since as we argued earlier these can be computed from the near - horizon data once one knows how to identify the angles .",

    "having explored the space of known vacuum extremal solutions in diverse dimensions , we now turn to ( yet to be found ) black ring geometries in spacetime dimensions greater than five .",
    "since exact vacuum solutions representing such objects are not known , our entire discussion will be based on the assumption that such solutions actually exist .",
    "nonetheless , based upon the results presented previously , we will argue that one can still determine some important physical properties of such solutions .",
    "to begin with it is useful to develop an intuitive picture for black rings in higher dimensions .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite very thin black rings can be modeled as a bent black strings ; this analysis was for black rings spinning only in the plane of the ring carrying no intrinsic angular momentum in the transverse directions .",
    "we expect that this class of solutions does not incorporate extremal black rings ; this is because there are no known regular extremal vacuum solutions with vanishing angular momenta in any single plane .",
    "so we will concentrate exclusively on rings which spin in every available two plane .",
    "this is different from the analysis of @xcite ; nevertheless , very thin extremal rings can be thought of as multiply spinning black strings .",
    "moreover , for extremal solutions we have access to another well defined limit in which we expect black rings to look like black strings : the near - horizon limit . after taking the near - horizon limit",
    ", we expect that the curvature of the ring disappears and is that of a straight string and to take the near - horizon limit @xmath42 gets rescaled by a factor which is sent to @xmath397 .",
    "therefore this is like scaling the original @xmath207 by a factor which tends to @xmath397 . ] .",
    "this suggests that the near - horizon geometry of an extremal black ring is that of an extremal black string .",
    "indeed this is exactly the case in five dimensions : the near - horizon geometry of the extremal black ring is isometric to that of a boosted kerr black string  @xcite .",
    "however , we will see this picture is only useful for odd dimensional black rings in @xmath9 for @xmath398 .",
    "as we move away from the near - horizon geometry , we do need to bend the @xmath399 of the string to ensure that we have an asymptotically flat solution .",
    "this will not be possible for a generic boosted string .",
    "the reason is the tension carried by the string , determined by the @xmath356 component of the effective stress tensor . if we attempt to bend a tensile string we need to add energy - momentum into the system , taking us away from vacuum solutions . to ensure that we are able to wind the string into a ring",
    ", we demand that the string be tensionless . using this leads to the condition @xmath400",
    "note that this the same as the condition derived in @xcite for the balance of singly spinning rings .",
    "the difference between our analysis and theirs is that they consider boosted schwarzschild strings while we are interested in boosted extremal mp strings .",
    "while the two solutions are physically different , the leading contribution to the tension only arises from the mass of the solution and not the angular momentum , so the balance condition is unchanged .",

    "note that this argument relies crucially on the fact that the mp string being tensionless  otherwise one would have an extra term in the smarr relation coming from that of the string .",

    "intuitively , this is easy to understand once one thinks of the ring as a bent black string ; in the string picture one has just momentum density which produces a current .",
    "for singly spinning rings , the rest of the source should then reduce to that of schwarzschild at each point on the ring .",
    "now , in the weak field approximation , a schwarzschild black hole is flat space perturbed by a point mass for source ; because these black holes possess only one length scale the weak field approximation is equivalent to the far - field behaviour .",

    "however , such rotating black holes possess other intrinsic length scales ( associated to the angular momenta ) and therefore the weak field source is not given simply by the far field solution . indeed , the source for a kerr black hole is a complicated distribution of negative mass density and one expects that mp black holes to have similarly complicated sources .",
    "it is possible however that one may need to only focus on slowly spinning black holes @xmath467 . in this case",

    "in particular , the physical parameters of the ring receive @xmath468 corrections in five dimensions , but remain uncorrected at this order in higher dimensions . the reason for this",

    "this results in a shift of the physical parameters measured at infinity at order @xmath479 . in higher dimensions the constant term in the expansion of the weak field solution ( @xmath482 ) occurs at a higher order @xmath483 and",
    "thus the physical parameters are not affected at @xmath479 .",
    "now , consider constructing a multiply spinning ring solution in asymptotically flat space in the weak field approximation .",
    "the weak field source for such a solution must depend on @xmath484 ( the ring radius ) , @xmath433 the radius of the transverse sphere , and the angular momenta @xmath257 in the transverse sphere .",
    "such a solution is valid for @xmath485 .",
    "second , we take a linearized ring solution about the mp - string ; this will depend on @xmath331 , @xmath160 and the mp rotation parameters @xmath150 ; note that for extremal solutions @xmath486 .",

    "now , we would like to match these two solutions in an analogous manner to the analysis in @xcite which led to for singly spinning rings . from our near - horizon analysis @xmath488 and @xmath489 .",
    "since there are two scales in the problem @xmath490 the trick is to work in a region where both of the approximate solutions above are valid .",

    "we expect this intersection always happens along a co - dimension one surface ; in seven dimensions the surfaces intersect along a connected curve while in nine dimensions the intersection occurs along a connected surface .",
    "this is seen clearly in , where we see the intersection of the surfaces of extremal mp and black rings in @xmath536 .",
    "the intersection happens along a connected curve , which extends off to large values of @xmath537 or @xmath327 and thereby allows extremal rings with arbitrarily small values of @xmath388 ; hence there exist extremal rings with @xmath538 .",
    "this feature is a novel prediction of our analysis for black rings in @xmath539 .",
    "we now discuss a few features of extremal black rings that our analysis reveals .",
    "we have already mentioned that higher dimensional extremal rings can stay balanced with arbitrarily small angular momentum in the plane of the ring ( essentially by being spun up in the transverse directions ) , see .",
    "this is in fact in line with the observation made for doubly spinning ( non - extremal ) rings five dimensions in @xcite that increasing the transverse spin tends to reduce @xmath533 .",
    "intuitively , this might be attributed to a spin - spin interaction of anti - podal components of the ring along the @xmath18 .",

    "one heuristic reason for this is that thin rings are like hula - hoops , while ultra - spinning black holes ( even extremal ) are like disks ; for given mass the disks tend to be thinner than rings and hence have smaller area @xcite . of course , we are far from newtonian physics in this strong gravity regime of extremal black holes , but the intuitive argument serves to illustrate the essential distinction between the objects .    from",
    "it is clear that the black ring area is monotonically decreasing with @xmath388 for the special case of all the transverse angular momenta being equal , unlike the mp black hole where the area is maximized at the symmetric point ( @xmath540 ) .",
    "this is because the ring picks out a preferred direction and so the area has no characteristic feature as a function of @xmath388 . on the contrary , the absence preferred choice for mp black holes results in an asymmetric behaviour of @xmath541 , with a characteristic maximum .",
    "this monotonicity property for the rings is lost when we consider generic rotations in the transverse @xmath179 .",
    "[ [ membrane - limit ] ] membrane limit : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in we showed that the extremal mp black holes have an ultra - spinning limit following @xcite ; this limit appears to be more subtle for extremal black rings . to see this recall that above we demonstrated that the membrane limit commutes with the near - horizon limit for mp black holes .",
    "now consider taking the limit in the near - horizon of an extremal black string with horizon topology @xmath542 in @xmath2 spacetime dimensions .",
    "we expect to obtain a black brane with horizon topology @xmath543 by the arguments of . ignoring the flat space factors thus generated ( arising from the @xmath544s where we sent @xmath545 )",
    ", we have a black string in some @xmath546 dimensions .",
    "this string is however tensile  the pressurelessness condition being dimension dependent , leads to differing values of the boost for the string and the membrane ( in the former case we have the boost as in , while in the latter the boost would have to be @xmath547 ) . so assuming that a potential membrane limit commutes with the near - horizon limits for the extremal black rings , we are led to a contradiction . on the other hand , inspection of the phase diagram suggests that as one of the @xmath297 gets large , the ring ` behaves ' like a lower dimensional ring .",
    "however , upon closer inspection , it appears that in addition to taking the @xmath548 we need to rescale @xmath388 by a finite amount to precisely recover the lower dimensional ring s extremal locus .",
    "this is consistent with the differing values of boost described above .",
    "putting these things together suggests that there is no simple analog of the membrane limit of mp black holes for the black rings .",
    "the main focus of the present paper has been an exploration of vacuum extremal black holes in dimensions greater than five . as motivated in the restriction to extremal solutions",
    "is non - trivial and as we have discussed there is a rich moduli space of such solutions even in vacuum gravity . apart from examining aspects of known examples of extremal black objects based on the mp black holes , we have also obtained predictions of certain properties of hitherto unknown extremal black ring solutions .",
    "on the mathematical side , we have shown that vacuum solutions with degenerate horizons have an enhanced near - horizon isometry assuming the rotational symmetry of the solution enhances such that spatial sections of the horizon are cohomogeneity-1 . from the known solutions to date , mp black holes ( and strings ) with equal angular momenta in even dimensions and all but one equal angular momenta in odd dimensions fall into this class of geometries .",
    "it is natural to expect that this symmetry enhancement extends to situations where the spatial sections of the horizon have less symmetry given the fact that we proved this was the case for the generic extremal mp black holes with unequal angular momenta .",
    "however , proving the general statement requires new techniques beyond those developed in @xcite which we exploited .",
    "the primary complication is that the method used is well adapted to cohomogeneity-1 metrics on the horizon ; higher cohomogeneity metrics occurring in the generic case are troublesome due to absence of well - adapted coordinates for the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , given that there are high cohomogeneity metrics displaying the enhanced symmetry , it would be interesting to see if the theorem proved in can be generalized .",
    "we have also presented explicit examples of vacuum near - horizon geometries with horizon topology @xmath549 and @xmath550 .",
    "of course , in higher than five dimensions one might expect other topologies .",
    "although we have concentrated on black rings , it would be very interesting to find solutions with even more exotic horizon topology . with a ricci flat metric on @xmath27 , @xmath551 .",
    "while this gives examples with non - trivial horizon topology they are in a sense trivial and we do not expect them to correspond to near - horizon limits of asymptotically flat black holes . it is the non - trivial examples which take the form of fibrations over ads@xmath108 which we are interested in . ]    given the near - horizon geometry alone , an important question is how much of the physical characteristics of the solution , such as the conserved charges , can be determined .",
    "we have argued that while it possible using komar integrals to capture certain angular momenta , the near - horizon metric does not capture the mass of the black object or the angular velocities ( both of which depend on the asymptotic stationary frame ) . more generally ,",
    "as discussed at end of , a given near - horizon geometry might not always be extended to a full solution with prescribed asymptotics .",
    "understanding the constraints on when this can be done is an interesting open question .",
    "the new physical result in the paper is the prediction of the phase structure for extremal black rings in higher dimensions .",
    "as we have emphasized , higher dimensional black holes / rings are not easily amenable to analytic treatment owing to the lack of solution generating techniques . given this , our strategy has been to exploit the mathematical result above , combined with certain plausible physical assumptions , to construct the phase diagram for black rings .    the logical argument for our construction of extremal black rings can be summarized as follows : given the near - horizon symmetry enhancement for degenerate horizons , extremal black rings should have a near - horizon that has three main characteristics ( i ) isometry , ( ii ) ring topology , and ( iii ) correct rotational symmetry , , must be a subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "we already know of a solution in odd spacetime dimensions with these characteristics  the near - horizon geometry of the extremal mp black string .",
    "the mp black string is not asymptotically flat , but heuristically , can be made so if the string is tensionless , by bending it .",
    "the tensionlessness condition fixes the boost parameter of the string to a numerical ( dimension dependent ) constant , which is independent of the transverse rotation .",
    "our main claim is that the black string near - horizon geometry at this particular value of the boost parameter is _ isometric _ to the near - horizon geometry of an extremal black ring .",
    "the rest of the analysis is then aimed at determining the physical parameters of the black ring .",
    "we have argued that the conserved quantities of the extremal ring are the same as those for the corresponding black string .",
    "we infer the angular momenta in the transverse sphere of the ring using the komar integrals  these are therefore the same as the corresponding values of the mp black string .",
    "we assume the mass of the asymptotically flat black ring receives no corrections relative to the mp black string .",
    "the remaining physical parameter , the angular momentum in the plane of the ring we also argue agrees with the string . deducing this involves realizing that the only admissible correction to the string s angular momentum occurs at leading order in @xmath468 ( recall that @xmath331 size of the circle wrapped by the string ) and showing that such corrections do not arise in @xmath552 .",
    "this then completes the determination of the physical parameters . finally , we put bounds on the physical parameters by requiring that black ring extremal locus is unbounded above and bounded below by the extremal locus of the mp black holes .",
    "this requirement implies uniqueness is not violated , but this is not demanded by any known theorem .",
    "curiously , uniqueness is satisfied by the known extremal black objects in five dimensions .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand the origin of this uniqueness and explore its consequences further .",
    "of course , a generic feature of higher dimensional non - extremal black holes is violation of uniqueness .",
    "therefore , from this point of view , it seems remarkable that uniqueness is restored for extremal black holes in five dimensions .",
    "curiously , note that the extremal doubly spinning rings do come arbitrarily close to violating uniqueness @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that based on our proposal , if any @xmath553 ( in ) it seems one can not get extremal rings arbitrarily close to mp black holes .",
    "it is thus tempting to speculate that this suggests all @xmath509 ( consistent with our final proposal ) , so that extremal higher dimensional rings can come arbitrarily close to violating uniqueness as in five dimensions .",
    "our analysis throws up some interesting features of five dimensional solutions which do not seem to be shared by their higher dimensional counterparts .",
    "apart from the fact that extremal rings in five dimensions have slightly different characteristics ( in terms of the mixing of the ring and the transverse directions ) , there is a curious fact about the entropy of five dimensional black objects .",
    "the area formula for extremal five dimensional mp or doubly spinning black rings takes an extremely simple form .",
    "for example , for the extremal black ring solution of @xcite one has @xmath554 the simplicity of this and analogous expressions for four and five dimensional black holes have been used to motivate a microscopic counting of the entropy of these objects @xcite .",
    "these results rely on locally supersymmetric d - brane intersections ( with supersymmetry being globally broken due to different supercharges being preserved at different intersections ) .",
    "it is well known that in dimensions greater than five there are no localized supersymmetric black holes .",
    "further , the known extremal solutions in vacuum gravity have complicated area formulae .",
    "for example for the 6d extremal mp one has _",
    "this seems suggestive that the mechanism for micro - state counting of black holes in four and five dimensions is a happy accident of local supersymmetry , while higher dimensional extremal solutions are intrinsically more complex .",
    "although the focus of this paper has been on asymptotically flat vacuum black holes let us comment on ads black holes , as some of the techniques used in this paper can easily accommodate a cosmological constant . for example",
    ", the theorem we proved on symmetry enhancement in the near - horizon limit applies equally to ads vacuum gravity .",
    "our discussion of extremal black holes has relied heavily on the use of gaussian null coordinates and the ` double - scaling ' limit which defines the near - horizon geometry .",
    "indeed such coordinates have been used previously in the context of supersymmetric ads@xmath555 black holes . in particular , under some assumptions , supersymmetric ads@xmath555 black rings were ruled out .",
    "this was deduced from a classification of all possible near - horizon geometries of supersymmetric ads@xmath555 black holes with @xmath556 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "more recently , again in the ads / cft context , a map relating gravitational solutions in asymptotically ads spacetimes to solutions of conformal fluid dynamics has been constructed in a long - wavelength approximation @xcite .",
    "the discussion so far has been for uncharged fluids just carrying energy - momentum corresponding to ads vacuum gravity .",
    "note that extremal solutions in pure ads gravity can not be supersymmetric .",
    "however , the techniques used in this paper , which rely only on extremality , could be applied to the study of `` extremal '' fluids .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to exploit the gaussian null coordinates to analyze the entropy current for such degenerate horizons , generalizing the recent analysis of @xcite .",
    "it would also be interesting to develop techniques to analyze the behaviour of extremal fluids in confining gauge theories as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the latter analysis predicts a phase diagram for black holes and rings in ads spacetimes using the dual field theory ; this could provide an interesting test for the phase diagram proposed in this paper .",

    "pf , jl and mr are supported by an stfc rolling grant , while hkk is supported by a stfc postdoctoral fellowship .",
    "in this appendix we describe how to construct the near - horizon geometries for the mp black holes and strings given in and , following the approach developed in  @xcite .",
    "the starting point for any of these calculations are the mp solutions which , in boyer - lindquist type coordinates , are : @xmath557 in @xmath170 dimensions and @xmath558 in @xmath14 dimensions , where @xmath559 and the rest of the functions and coordinates are defined as in the main text relative to the original mp metric in  @xcite . without loss of generality",

    ", we easily obtain the following components , as they are not affected by the transformation  ( [ nhtrans ] ) : @xmath581 now define @xmath582 .",
    "elimination of the divergent @xmath583 terms in @xmath584 requires @xmath585 consistency obviously requires that the @xmath586 be constants .",
    "this is certainly true for the examples we are dealing with and ultimately follows from the fact that we are dealing with solutions to the field equations .",
    "next , it is straightforward to check that , after the taking the near - horizon limit , @xmath587 and hence now we need only @xmath588 to determine the full near - horizon metric .",
    "we now turn to @xmath589 .",
    "eliminating the @xmath590 term yields the condition @xmath591 this equation is only consistent if the rhs is a constant and further , since @xmath592 a second consistency condition is that @xmath593 ; again , these consistency requirements are met for the solutions we are dealing with .",
    "we could now determine @xmath594 by removing the @xmath583 divergence in @xmath589 .",
    "however , note that @xmath595 vanishes in the near - horizon limit , and hence to construct the near - horizon geometry we do not need @xmath594 . finally , observe that we may write @xmath596 . putting this all together ,",
