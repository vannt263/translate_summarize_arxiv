    "given a diagram @xmath2 of a link and a modulus @xmath3 , a ( fox ) coloring ( @xcite ) is an assignment of integers modulo @xmath0 to the arcs of @xmath2 such that at each crossing twice the color assigned to the over - arc equals the sum of the colors assigned to the under - arcs , modulo @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig : xtop ] ) .",
    "for each diagram and for each modulus @xmath3 there is always at least one solution to this problem namely by assigning the same color ( i.e. , integer modulo @xmath0 ) to each and every arc of the diagram ; thus there are exactly @xmath0 such solutions modulo @xmath0 .",
    "these are the trivial solutions modulo @xmath0 i.e. , the so - called trivial @xmath0-colorings of the diagram .",
    "the non - trivial @xmath0-colorings are the solutions , modulo @xmath0 , which involve at least two distinct colors .    * remark*. we remark that it is well known that this system of equations is also a system of relations for the first homology group of the 2-fold branched covering along the link ( @xcite , theorem 3.3 ) . in fact",
    ", the fundamental group of the @xmath4-fold branched covering along a link is presented by labeling the arcs of the unoriented link diagram and having relations of the form @xmath5 read off at each crossing when @xmath6 is the label of the over - crossing line .",
    "it then follows that @xmath7 ( the first homology group of the @xmath4-fold branched covering along the link @xmath8 ) has presentation with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the corresponding elements in the abelianization of the fundamental group ( @xcite ) .",
    "should one set the color of one of the arcs equal to @xmath11 then there would be a bijective correspondence between this set of colorings and @xmath12 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the fundamental group of the @xmath4-fold branched covering along the link is itself a non - abelian generalization of the fox coloring .",
    "while we do not use this aspect of the topology here , we are aware of it and it may be of use in later work . for more background on this material",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if a diagram endowed with an @xmath0-coloring undergoes a reidemeister move , there is a unique reassignment of colors to the arcs involved in the move such that the new assignment is an @xmath0-coloring of the resulting diagram .",
    "since these reassignments are reversible there is a bijection between the @xmath0-colorings before and after the performance of a finite number of reidemeister moves .",
    "furthermore , these reassignments preserve trivial @xmath0-colorings and thus they preserve also non - trivial @xmath0-colorings .    therefore the number of @xmath0-colorings is a link invariant ; the fact that a diagram of a link admits or not non - trivial @xmath0-colorings is an invariant of that link .",
    "it is known that there are links which do not admit non - trivial colorings over a given modulus .",
    "for example , the trefoil only admits non - trivial colorings over moduli divisible by @xmath13 .    in the course of our work on colorings , we have observed that for some choices of a modulus @xmath3 and a link admitting non - trivial @xmath0-colorings , the following occurs .",
    "there are distinct non - trivial @xmath0-colorings , @xmath14 ( realized on an otherwise arbitrary diagram @xmath2 of this link ) and there is a permutation @xmath15 of the @xmath0 colors such that , for each arc @xmath16 of @xmath2 , the colors assigned to @xmath16 in the coloring @xmath17 , say @xmath18 , and in the coloring @xmath19 , say @xmath20 , satisfy : @xmath21 two such colorings will be said `` related '' .",
    "an instance where this occurs is depicted in figure [ fig:9_40tri ] .    on the other hand",
    "it is not true that any permutation transforms the colors of a coloring into the colors of another coloring ( see figure [ fig:9_40bis ] ) .",
    "moreover , given non - trivial @xmath0-colorings @xmath17 and @xmath19 , realized on the same diagram , it may happen that there is no permutation @xmath15 of the @xmath0 colors such that for each arc @xmath16 of @xmath2 @xmath21 we will then say `` @xmath19 is essentially distinct from @xmath17 '' , in the given modulus , and the colorings split into equivalence classes ( to be elaborated upon below ) . in figure [ fig:9_40 ] we list representatives of the distinct equivalence classes of the non - trivial @xmath22-colorings of @xmath23 .",
    "we will be primarily concerned with permutations that preserve the coloring equation at each crossing for these are the ones that actually give us a corresponding coloring of the link and we will show that the relation sketched above among @xmath0-colorings of a diagram is an equivalence relation ( see below ) .",
    "we remark that the articles @xcite and @xcite address the same topic as the current article .",
    "their definition of equivalent colorings assumes one has a list of all non - trivial @xmath0-colorings for a given diagram and states simply that any two of these colorings are equivalent provided there is a permutation of the @xmath0 colors that , for each arc in the diagram , sends the color in this arc in the source coloring to the color in the same arc in the target coloring .",
    "this is equivalent to our definition .",
    "unfortunately , for the purposes of counting equivalence classes of colorings in generic cases , the methodology in @xcite and @xcite seems to resort to generating classes of colorings by letting the symmetric group on the @xmath0 colors act on a given @xmath0-coloring .",
    "as we see in figure [ fig:9_40bis ] , there are assignments of colors to a diagram obtained in this way that do not constitute colorings .",
    "the formulas in the articles referred to above predict in general less equivalence classes than ours due to their over - counting of the elements on each orbit .",
    "the equivalence classes of colorings constitute a topological invariant and in this article we provide combinatorial information about them .",
    "we hope this will prove to be useful for topological purposes .",
    "in section [ sect : prelim ] we discuss preliminaries such as the nullity and the generating arcs of a coloring ( subsection [ subsect : nullity ] ) , and the definition of the equivalence classes ( subsection [ subsect : equivclass ] ) . in section [",
    "sect : results ] we calculate the number of equivalence classes in an infinite number of instances .",
    "consider a link , @xmath8 , along with a diagram @xmath24 for that link . regarding the arcs of this diagram as algebraic variables we write the homogeneous system of linear equations consisting of the equations read off each crossing as illustrated in figure [ fig : xtop ] .",
    "we call the matrix of the coefficients of this homogeneous system of linear equations * the coloring matrix of @xmath24*.    any coloring matrix is made up of integers .",
    "specifically , along each row one finds exactly two 1 s and one -2 , the rest being perhaps 0 s .",
    "thus , adding all the columns of a coloring matrix we obtain a column made up of 0 s .",
    "it follows that the determinant of any coloring matrix is 0 .    upon performance of reidemeister moves on a diagram ,",
    "the changes on the original coloring matrix are realized by operations that constitute a subset of the following operations on integer matrices .",
    "these operations are generated by    1 .",
    "multiplication of a row ( column ) by @xmath25 ; 2 .",
    "addition to one row ( column ) of integer linear combinations of other rows ( columns ) ; 3 .",
    "insertion ( deletion ) of a row and column made up of 0 s except for a 1 at the diagonal entry ; 4 .",
    "permutations of rows ( columns ) .",
    "these are the operations which relate equivalent matrices over the integers ( see @xcite , page 50 ) .",
    "so the equivalence class of a coloring matrix is a topological invariant of the link under study . for each of these equivalence classes of matrices over the integers",
    "there is an outstanding representative which is called the smith normal form ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although the smith normal form ( snf ) is a familiar object we elaborate here slightly about it in order to bring out some connections with colorings of knots which we do not find in the literature .    an integer matrix in smith normal form is a matrix such that its entries are all zero except perhaps along the diagonal . along the diagonal the entries are non - negative ( without loss of generality ) and the @xmath26-th entry divides the @xmath27-th entry , up to a certain index @xmath28 , and after that , the entries are all @xmath11 s : @xmath29    the @xmath30 s",
    "are called the * invariant factors * of the equivalence class ; their name reflects the fact that the multi - set formed by them is an invariant of the equivalence class .",
    "this multi - set is then a topological invariant if it originates from a coloring matrix .",
    "moreover , the smith normal form of a coloring matrix is sure to have a @xmath11 at the last entry of the diagonal since we proved above that the determinant of a coloring matrix is @xmath11 .",
    "the product of the remaining entries of the diagonal of the smith normal form of a coloring matrix is * the determinant of the link * under study .",
    "this is also a topological invariant .",
    "( in passing , it is known that for knots i.e. , @xmath31-component links , the determinant of the knot is an odd integer , see @xcite . )",
    "we denote the smith normal form of a matrix @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "being an element of the equivalence class of @xmath32 , @xmath33 is obtained by a finite number of the operations listed above .",
    "we may then collect all the information concerning the row operations into an invertible matrix called @xmath34 and likewise for the column operations into an invertible matrix called @xmath35 to state ( @xcite ) @xmath36 with the juxtaposition of pairs of consecutive symbols on the right - hand side of the equation denoting matrix multiplication .",
    "let us now fix an otherwise arbitrary link along with one of its diagrams .",
    "let us then relate the smith normal form ( and its invariant factors ) of the coloring matrix of this diagram to the corresponding system of linear homogeneous equations and its solutions .",
    "there are always solutions of this system of equations namely by assigning the same integer to each arc .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the determinant of the coloring matrix is @xmath11 .",
    "one of the algebraic variables may take on any value and if there is no other zero entry along the diagonal of the smith normal form , then the remaining variables are uniquely determined once the former variable has been assigned a value . going back to the original system of equations we obtain the so - called trivial solutions i.e. , those solutions that assign the same value to each and every arc of the diagram .",
    "the invariant factors associated to our coloring matrix via its smith normal form allow us to do something else .",
    "suppose we choose a factor @xmath0 of one of these invariant factors and decide to work over the integers modulo @xmath0 .",
    "then our smith normal form in this new setting acquired at least one more @xmath11 along the diagonal .",
    "then , there is at least one more variable which can take on any value , modulo @xmath0 .",
    "going back to the original system of equations , there are at least two arcs which can take on any value modulo @xmath0 .",
    "hence , we now have polychromatic colorings i.e. , solutions where at least two distinct arcs take on two distinct colors that is , values modulo @xmath0 . had we chosen an @xmath0 which does not possess common factors with the invariant factors , then modulo @xmath0 there would have been only trivial colorings .    [ prop : genarcsp]let @xmath37 be an odd prime .",
    "let @xmath2 be a link diagram .",
    "the number of @xmath11 s @xmath38modulo @xmath39 along the diagonal of the smith normal form of the coloring matrix , @xmath32 , of @xmath2 , equals the least number of arcs of @xmath2 that can independently receive colors modulo @xmath37 , and generate each @xmath37-coloring of @xmath2 .    proof .",
    "if the smith normal form exhibits @xmath40 @xmath11 s modulo @xmath37 , this means that the space of solutions has dimension @xmath40 ; working modulo a prime implies we are doing linear algebra over a field so it makes sense to talk about dimensions of spaces and bases",
    ". then matrix @xmath35 in ( [ eqn : eqn ] ) above operates a change of basis taking us back to algebraic variables equivalent to the arcs of the original diagram .",
    "then @xmath40 of these arcs have to generate all the colorings ( i.e. , all the solutions of the indicated system of equations modulo @xmath37 ) in terms of a basis of coloring vectors .",
    "[ def : pnul ] the number @xmath40 in the proof of proposition [ prop : genarcsp ] is called the @xmath37-nullity @xmath38or the rank mod @xmath42 of the coloring matrix of @xmath2 .",
