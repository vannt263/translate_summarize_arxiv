    "in the past 15 years , there has been a tremendous growth in the number of studies of open systems bearing both gain and loss , motivated to a considerable degree by the study of the specially balanced @xmath0-symmetric dynamical models  @xcite .",
    "the original proposal of bender and collaborators towards the study of such systems was made as an alternative to the postulate of hermiticity in quantum mechanics .",
    "yet , in the next decade , proposals aimed at the experimental realization of such @xmath0-symmetric systems found a natural `` home '' in the realm of optics  @xcite . within the latter , the above theoretical proposal ( due to the formal similarity of the maxwell equations in the paraxial approximation and the schrdinger equation ) quickly led to a series of experiments  @xcite . in turn , these efforts motivated experiments in numerous other areas , which span , among others , the examination of @xmath0-symmetric electronic circuits  @xcite , mechanical systems  @xcite and whispering - gallery microcavities  @xcite .    in the same spirit , another important idea that has originally been proposed in a different setting ( namely that of high - energy physics  @xcite ) but has recently found intriguing applications in the context of wave guiding and manipulation in the realm of optics is that of super - symmetry ( susy )  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that from a potential with desired properties , one can obtain a susy - partner potential that will be isospectral to ( i.e. , possess the same spectrum as ) the original one , with the possible exception of one eigenvalue .",
    "in fact , taking the idea one step further , starting from a desired ground state eigenfunction , one can design the relevant super - symmetric partner potentials in a systematic fashion , as discussed , e.g. , in  @xcite , both for continuum and even for discrete problems .",
    "in fact , more recently , the two ideas ( of @xmath0-symmetry , or anyway non - hermiticity , and susy ) have been combined to construct susy - partner complex optical potentials designed to have real spectra  @xcite",
    ". an expected application of these ideas that has also started to be explored ( extending the spirit of corresponding studies in the @xmath0-symmetric setting  @xcite ) is in using susy transformations to achieve transparent and one - way reflectionless complex optical potentials  @xcite .",
    "the above works have essentially constrained the interplay of @xmath0 symmetry and susy at the level of linear potentials . naturally , however , except for very low optical intensity , the crystals considered in the relevant applications bear nonlinear features , e.g. , due to the kerr effect .",
    "hence , our focus in the present work will be to extend these linear ideas of @xmath0 symmetry and susy to a nonlinear case example .",
    "moreover , we will select an example that blends two additional characteristics . on the one hand",
    ", one of our super - symmetric partners will constitute a famous and well - known solvable model in quantum mechanics , namely the celebrated pschl - teller potential  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it will turn out to be the case that not only the linear but also the nonlinear variant of the problem will be analytically solvable , in fact for arbitrary powers of the nonlinearity , in a special limit and will naturally connect with the linear solutions of the potential . in",
    "what follows , in sec . ii we will first present the general theory of linear @xmath0-supersymmetric potentials",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii we will consider the special nonlinear solutions and their asymptotic linear limit reduction .",
    "numerical results will corroborate the above analytical findings and we will also explore the spectral and dynamical stability of the nonlinear waveforms . finally , in section iv , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "as is done generally in the theory of susy , we consider an operator @xmath1 such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the super - potential and an operator @xmath4 of the form : @xmath5 it is important to accentuate here ( see also  @xcite ) that in the case of a complex super - potential @xmath3 , contrary to the hermitian case of a real @xmath3 , @xmath4 is not a hermitian adjoint operator of @xmath1 ( hence the different symbol ) .",
    "then , defining the potentials @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , we have that the operators @xmath8 are isospectral ( with the exception of the fundamental mode in the potential @xmath9 which lacks a counterpart in @xmath10 .",
    "more specifically , the eigenvalues satisfy @xmath11 for @xmath12 ( cf . also  @xcite ) .",
    "we note in passing that the eigenvectors of the two cases are also related , i.e. , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "now , assuming that @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and that @xmath18 , we find that ( cfr .",
    "@xcite ) the potentials have to satisfy the following conditions : @xmath19 the remarkable finding of the linear spectral analysis of  @xcite was that these authors , motivated by the sl@xmath20 potential algebra were able to derive a number of special case examples of simple functional forms of complex @xmath3 s which give rise to complex susy potentials .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable of their examples concerns the super - potential @xmath21 which gives rise ( assuming hereafter without loss of generality that @xmath22 ) to the super - symmetric partners of the form : @xmath23    we chiefly focus hereafter on the remarkable special case of @xmath24 , previously considered , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the exceptional characteristic of this case is that it stems from a real potential @xmath10 which is well - known to be exactly solvable in the realm of elementary quantum mechanics , namely the pschl - teller potential  @xcite .",
    "while its eigenfunctions can also be written down in an explicit form by means of hypergeometric functions , here we will restrict our considerations to the relevant ( bound state ) eigenvalues which in the context of the above example assume an extremely simple form as : @xmath25 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{eqn9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such bound state eigenvalues only exist when @xmath26 .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that for the @xmath27 superscript potential , it will be : @xmath11 , i.e. , all the relevant bound state eigenvalues should also emerge in the @xmath0-symmetric spectrum of the potential @xmath9 , just as they appear in the hermitian ( real ) spectrum of the potential @xmath10 . the only eigenvalue that will not be captured by this relation is @xmath28 ;",
    "see the relevant details on the spectrum of @xmath9 below .",
    "furthermore , we expect that , when varying @xmath29 , bound state eigenvalues will emerge as @xmath29 crosses @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 in both the spectra of @xmath33 .",
    "all of these conclusions are fully corroborated by the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath34 considered therein turns out to be real , as may be anticipated by the @xmath0-symmetry of the model , but more importantly , it turns out to be identical to that of its super - symmetric pschl - teller partner , as can be seen from the theoretical lines confirming the bifurcation of the point spectrum eigenvalues at the locations theoretically predicted . finally , indeed , the only eigenvalue that is not captured is @xmath28 which turns out to be _ invariant _ , under variations of @xmath29 . as a final note ,",
    "we point out that generalizations of this potential with arbitrary coefficients in both the real and the imaginary part were considered in  @xcite and the relevant @xmath0-symmetric transition threshold was identified as an inequality associating the real and the imaginary part prefactors .",
    "the pertinent inequality here assumes the form @xmath35 and is generically satisfied ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) , as can be expected by the super - symmetric partnership of the potential with a hermitian one bearing real eigenvalues for all @xmath29 .     of the operator @xmath34 of eq .",

    "the solid lines represent the analytical predictions based on the potential s super - symmetric partner @xmath10 corresponding to an analytically tractable pschl - teller potential.,width=226 ]    as a side remark , we observe that @xmath9 is invariant under @xmath37 .",
    "further , both @xmath38 and @xmath29 are arbitrary real numbers and not integers .",
    "interestingly , as shown in @xcite , in case @xmath39 is not an integer , then remarkably , the eigenvalue spectrum has two branches :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 where @xmath43 .    from this",
    ", we infer that when @xmath24 and @xmath29 is not an integer , @xmath44 has two nodeless states ( i.e. @xmath45 ) with energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions    @xmath46    @xmath47    although the latter ( as per our spectral results of fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] ) will only be present for @xmath48 .",
    "interestingly , while for @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the ground state , but for @xmath51 , @xmath52 corresponds to the ground state .",
    "we now turn to the corresponding nonlinear model which is the basis for the present analysis . examining the case of the focusing nonlinearity ,",
    "the operator @xmath34 is augmented into the nonlinear problem : @xmath53 the most physically relevant case is that of the cubic nonlinearity @xmath54 , corresponding to the kerr effect , although in recent years , examples of higher order nonlinearities ( like @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) have been experimentally realized ; see , e.g. , for a recent example  @xcite .",
    "the relevant nonlinear problem has been partially considered for @xmath54 in a two - parametric generalization of the potential associated with @xmath9  @xcite ; see also the more recent discussions of  @xcite .",
    "while all of these works were restricted to the cubic case , below we will obtain exact solutions for arbitrary nonlinearity powers .",
    "moreover , we will explain , through our @xmath0-susy framework the existence of nonlinear dipole ( and , by extension , tripole etc . )",
    "solutions identified in  @xcite , emerging from the higher excited states of the underlying linear problem .",
    "it can be directly found that the relevant nonlinear single - hump solution for arbitrary @xmath57 is of the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59\\left[\\frac{(\\kappa+2)^2}{4\\kappa^2}-b_i^2\\right],\\ ] ] @xmath60 and @xmath61 note when @xmath62 and @xmath63 ,   @xmath64 and our solution reduces to the well known solution of the nlse with @xmath65 .",
    "also note that when @xmath55 , @xmath66 which vanishes at either @xmath67 or the special case @xmath24 .",
    "hereafter , we again restrain consideration to the special case of @xmath54 .    for @xmath68 , with @xmath69 ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath70 tends to zero and the solution ( [ eqn11 ] ) becomes the solution of the corresponding linear limit ( [ 6 ] ) by virtue of condition ( [ eq : ekappa ] ) .",
    "the solution ( [ eqn11 ] ) exists for @xmath71 when @xmath72 and for @xmath73 if @xmath74 .",
    "our analytical expression only yields the trivial solution for @xmath55 as mentioned earlier .",
    "notice also that when @xmath29 is fixed and @xmath75 varied , the solution tends to ( [ 5 ] ) when approaching the @xmath55 limit .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] shows the dependence of norm with respect to @xmath29 and @xmath75 when the condition ( [ eq : ekappa ] ) for solution ( [ eqn11 ] ) is applied .",

    "[ fig : norm ] are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : kappa1 ] and [ fig : kappa3 ] where the continuum tendency to the linear limit ( dark ) is shown as a variation over @xmath29 for @xmath54 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "apart from the analytical solution ( [ eqn11 ] ) which collides with the nodeless solution of the linear schrdinger equation , we have been able to find numerically the branch that collides with the solution with a node [ @xmath79 in ( [ 3])-([4 ] ) ] .",
    "these solutions are the generalizations ( for arbitrary @xmath75 ) of the `` dipoles '' of  @xcite . in those cases , solutions exist as long as @xmath80 and their monotonicity for @xmath81 is opposite to that of the fundamental solutions analytically identified above ( hence , the above mentioned collision ) .",
    "interestingly , it is worth mentioning that the latter dipole branch is present even for @xmath55 . in the same spirit ,",

    "2 therein ) , as well as the positivity of the poynting vector flux led those authors to conclude that the relevant solutions were nonlinearly stable .",
    "however , our systematic spectral stability analysis , illustrated in figs .",

    "( [ eqn11 ] ) , while @xmath93 and @xmath94 correspond , respectively , to the eigenvector and eigenvalue of the linearization around the solution .",
    "the existence of eigenvalues with re@xmath95 would in this ( @xmath0-symmetric and hence still ensuring the quartet symmetry of the relevant eigenvalues ) context signal the presence of an instability .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa1stab ] that indeed such an instability is present in the interval @xmath96 for the nodeless solutions of @xmath54 .",
    "further examination of the relevant phenomenology in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile3 ] reveals the origin of the instability and its _ stark _ contrast with the corresponding phenomenology in the standard nls model .",
    "in particular , the breaking of translational invariance ( due to the presence of the potential ) leads the corresponding neutral mode to exit along the imaginary axis of the spectral plane @xmath97 of the eigenvalues @xmath98 .",
    "however , it is well - known  @xcite that in the standard hamiltonian case , the relevant `` internal mode '' of the solitary wave associated with translation has a positive energy or signature and hence its collisions with other modes , including ones of the continuous spectrum , do not lead to instability . here",
    ", however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile3 ] exactly the opposite occurs . as the parameter @xmath29 is varied , the relevant eigenvalue moves towards the continuous spectrum ( whose lower limit is @xmath99 ) and the collision with it leads to a complex eigenvalue quartet , a feature that would never be possible for a single soliton of the regular nls , under a translation - symmetry - breaking perturbation .",
    "this is a remarkable feature of the @xmath0-symmetric nls model that is worthy of further exploration , possibly utilizing the notion ( recently discussed for @xmath0-symmetric models in  @xcite ) of krein signature .",
    "notice that the work of  @xcite considered a case in the vicinity of the @xmath0-phase transition , whereas in our setting , such a phase transition is _ impossible _ , given the real nature of the super - partner pschl - teller potential , as discussed above .",
    "[ fig : kappa1stab ] shows that dipolar solutions with a single node are unstable for almost all of their existence interval expect when @xmath100 , i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the linear limit .",
    "there are three different instability intervals : ( 1 ) for @xmath101 there are two instabilities , one of exponential nature and an oscillatory one , for @xmath102 the oscillatory instability is the only one that persists , while the formerly real eigenmode crosses the spectral plane origin and becomes imaginary for larger @xmath29 .",
    "( 3 ) for @xmath103 , there are two oscillatory instabilities , the previously mentioned one , and another one caused ( in a way similar to the nodeless case ) by the climbing up the imaginary axis of the eigenmode formerly unstable as a real pair , and its eventual collision with an eigenvalue bifurcating from the continuous spectrum .    for nodeless solutions with @xmath56 , we can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa3stab ] ( top panels ) that the solution is unstable throughout its range of existence because of an eigenmode entering the phonon band and causing oscillatory instabilities ; a second localized mode enters at @xmath104 and , finally , for @xmath105 , the soliton becomes exponentially unstable .",
    "analogously , the solutions with a node are unstable for all @xmath29 , incurring , in fact , typically multiple instabilities for each value of the parameter , which can be summarized as follows ( see the bottom panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : kappa3stab ] ) : an oscillatory instability is present for almost every value of @xmath29 ( @xmath106 ) ; apart from this we observe , for low values of @xmath29 , two pairs of real eigenvalues which coalesce into a quartet at @xmath107 ; this quartet leads to two imaginary pairs when @xmath108 ; one of them moves down along the imaginary axis and finally , at @xmath109 , an additional instability due to a real pair emerges",
    "..    it is relevant to note in passing , another interesting result which relates to the @xmath110 case ; we have found that for @xmath111 , the nodeless soliton is stable for _ every _ @xmath29 .",
    "this , as well as the results above indicate the strong dependence of the stability properties on the precise strength of the nonlinearity parameter .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the present work , we revisited a potential that has been explored previously in a number of studies relating to @xmath0-symmetric models .",
    "we discussed how for a special monoparametric family within this model , it is not only @xmath0-symmetric but also super - symmetric with a partner which is the pschl - teller potential , a feature which enabled us to identify its purely real spectrum ( and the bifurcations of bound states within it ) and to corroborate the corresponding results numerically .",
    "as a byproduct of its super - symmetric origin , this family of potentials was found to be devoid of a @xmath0-phase - transition .",
    "we then turned to a nonlinear variant of the model for arbitrary powers of the nonlinearity , and illustrated that exact nonlinear solitonic solutions degenerated in the appropriate limit to the linear states identified previously .",
    "while there was no @xmath0-phase - transition in this model , we found that the nonlinear solutions were still subject to instabilities , such as e.g. the one stemming from a collision of an internal mode with the continuous spectrum ( band edge ) , leading to a quartet of eigenvalues .",
    "the ensuing oscillatory instability led to an oscillating , progressively larger amplitude soliton in the cases examined .",
    "additional families of solutions were discussed , including e.g. the one - node branch ( dipolar solution ) , and their reduced stability ( in comparison to the nodeless branch ) was illustrated .    while this work , to the best of our understanding , is only a first step in connecting all three notions of @xmath0-symmetry , super - symmetric potentials and nonlinear phenomenology ( including instabilities ) , naturally this is a theme that is worthy of considerable further studies .",
    "for one thing , there are numerous additional super - symmetric potentials with real spectra that can be devised and are worth examining .",
    "for instance , the sl@xmath20 considerations of  @xcite already suggest some such options including the super - potentials @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "additionally , there have already been proposals for @xmath0-symmetric square well potentials considered in the susy framework  @xcite , and for non - hermitian susy hydrogen - like hamiltonians with real spectra  @xcite . especially in the latter higher dimensional context , understanding the delicate interplay of @xmath0-symmetry , super - symmetric models with their bound states , and collapse induced by nonlinearity could be an especially interesting topic . finally , there are some potentially intriguing deeper connections .",
    "susy partners are based on commutation formulae as are integrable nonlinear equations .",
    "perhaps the latter is intrinsically responsible for the similarity of the structure of the susy partner potentials with the well - known miura transformation responsible for converting the modified korteweg - de vries equation to the korteweg - de vries equation  @xcite . exploring these connections",
    "further would constitute an important direction for further studies and efforts along this direction are already underway  @xcite .",
