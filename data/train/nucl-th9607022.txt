    "in a hadronic lagrangian based approach to baryon properties meson - baryon loops must be calculated to obtain the contribution of virtual mesons . in a wide variety of situations",
    "these loops diverge .",
    "there are two ways of dealing with the problem of divergence .",
    "one is the well - established chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2pt )  @xcite , where only the pseudoscalar octet mesons are considered .",
    "the strategy is to use dimensional regularization and remove any divergence arising from a loop with an appropriate counterterm .",
    "the strength of the finite remainder , called a _ low energy constant _ , have to be fixed with the help of experimental data only .",
    "it may happen that one needs the physical quantity under study itself to fix the low energy constant .",
    "in such a situations is unable to make a prediction .",
    "the other popular approach is to introduce meson baryon to regulate loop integrals .",
    "unfortunately we know very little about such .",
    "the practice is to extrapolate the limited information about the for a range of space - like meson momentum , with the nucleon legs on mass - shell , to the full range of meson momentum using a multipole form .",
    "this very simple version of may be parameterized by one or two mass parameters .",
    "the masses are guessed and are often assigned values in the range @xmath3 mev to @xmath4mev .",
    "unfortunately one has difficulty dealing with the electromagnetic properties of the baryon when one uses a phenomenological in general and approximates it with an algebraically convenient form in particular .",
    "the electromagnetic vertex function @xmath5 , calculated at the one - loop level , as shown in fig .",
    "[ v1 ] ,    0.75 in = 4.8 in = 0.9 in    v1    but using at the meson - nucleon vertices will not satisfy the ward - takahashi identity : ( p^+q^-p^)_^em(p+q , p)=p+q - p- ( p+q)+(p ) , wt1 where @xmath6 is the proper self - energy , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the initial and final momenta . in fact , one does not even know what the expression for the self - energy is when a parameterized is used without any dynamical basis .",
    "ohta  @xcite proposes a particular path to resolving this problem .",
    "there are four features in his approach .",
    "ihe introduces an interaction lagrangian which reproduces the meson - baryon vertex function at the tree level .",
    "naturally the lagrangian uses functions of the derivative operators which operates on the fields associated with the three external legs of the vertex .",
    "ithe electromagnetic interactions are generated via minimal coupling : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the operator which measures the charge of the field on which @xmath11 operates .",
    "ihe then notes that the photo - meson amplitude resulting from his procedure contained a longitudinal seagull termmm ( @xmath0bb vertex ) by cutting a single meson ( baryon ) propagator . ]",
    "expressible entirely in terms of the vertex function .",
    "the presence of this longitudinal seagull term is essential for satisfying the .",
    "ithe seagull term found by ohta is robust in the context of his theory .",
    "the same seagull term appears in any meson - baryon one loop graph where the photon interacts with an internal line .",
    "also the seagull term appears at each meson - baryon vertex in the loop , thus generating two graphs .    because of its simplicity ohta s prescription has become quite popular .",
    "several authors have used it for one loop calculations of baryon electromagnetic and strangeness properties  @xcite .",
    "we show that ohta s lagrangian is necessarily neither hermitian nor invariant under charge conjugation .",
    "yet we succeed in reproducing ohta s prescription by using only the lorentz structure of the @xmath0mbb vertex and the ward - takahashi identity itself .",
    "unfortunately , we also find that , in general , the resulting seagull term is not robust .",
    "it should be noted that in a tree graph with dressed vertices as in the exchange current graphs , the seagull terms are exactly those appearing in a photo - meson amplitude .",
    "a loop graph of an electromagnetic amplitude will contain a seagull term if a meson baryon form factor has been used , but , in general , it will not be the same as that appearing in a photo - meson amplitude .",
    "the absence of robustness is established with the help of specially chosen subsets of feynman graphs for kp@xmath12 and @xmath0kp@xmath12 vertices . after the seagull terms in the @xmath0kp@xmath12 vertex",
    "are identified , we check their robustness by considering the one loop graphs for the strangeness content of proton .",
    "as we have noted , the seagull terms act robustly in dressed tree graphs .",
    "we consider two examples . in one ,",
    "the lowest order ( born ) graphs are dressed only by kaon self - energy .",
    "this does generate robust seagull terms . in the other the dressing",
    "is provided by ladders of a neutral scalar meson which couples only to strangeness .",
    "the resulting seagull terms are not robust .",
    "in fact the one loop graphs for the strangeness content of proton in this case does not even have any seagull term .",
    "this example is sufficient to establish that , in general , the seagull terms identified from the @xmath0mbb vertex are not robust .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes briefly ohta s strategy and mentions the difficulties .",
    "section  [ hermit ] discusses the lack of hermiticity and the absence of charge conjugation invariance of the ohta lagrangian . in section 4",
    "we analyze general 3-point and 4-point functions related to mbb and @xmath0mbb vertices and identify the seagull terms occurring in the latter .",
    "the result matches ohta s prescription .",
    "the only underlying assumption is that lorentz and translational invariances are good symmetries of the theory .",
    "otherwise , there is no reference to any particular dynamical model .",
    "the robustness of the resulting seagull terms is discussed in section  [ robust ] .",
    "section  [ rescon ] contains a summary of the results and conclusions .",
    "we mentioned in the previous section that the choice of a convenient form for the tells us nothing about the self - energy , thus making it impossible even to discuss the question of the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "one needs to know the lagrangian which generates the and the self - energy .",

    "we summarize his work very briefly . to appreciate his work",
    "fully one must read ref .",

    "we also simplify the presentation by substituting the more realistic pseudoscalar meson field used by ohta with a scalar field . while the substitution halves the number of independent covariant forms needed to describe the vertex function",

    "one can expand the vertex function @xmath13 in terms of a complete set of appropriate lorentz covariant forms .",

    "this point was established with the help of a gauge - invariant subset of graphs which describes the dressing of the meson - baryon vertex with a complete set of ladders of @xmath125-exchange . in this case",
