    "post - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) stars represent a brief ( @xmath8@xmath9 yr ) phase of stellar evolution during which stars move rapidly across the hr diagram at constant luminosity from the cool tip of the agb to the beginning of the hot white - dwarf cooling curve . as such",
    ", they are keys to both the past and the future : their atmospheric abundances provide important information about the mixing and mass - loss processes at work in agb stars , while their masses yield constraints on the masses of white dwarfs currently forming in globular clusters . to investigate these issues , we observed the pagb star zng  1 ( table  [ obs_parms ] ) in the globular cluster m5 ( ngc  5904 ) with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) . _",
    "first identified as a uv - bright star by @xcite on the basis of its extreme @xmath10 color , zng  1 was observed with _ iue _ by @xcite , who suggested that an apparent @xmath11 emission feature is the signature of a planetary nebula ( pn ) . combining this spectrum with other archival _ iue _ data",
    ", @xcite argued that the apparent feature is spurious and pointed out the p - cygni shape of the strong @xmath12 doublet . to test the pn hypothesis",
    ", @xcite used the _ hubble space telescope _ to obtain a wfpc2 h@xmath13 image and ghrs ultraviolet spectra of the star .",
    "the h@xmath13 image shows a bright g - type star only 05 from zng  1 , but no evidence for extended emission around the star .",
    "the ghrs spectra clearly show p - cygni profiles in the  doublet and discrete absorption components ( dacs ) , blueshifted by @xmath14 900 km s@xmath6 , in both  and  @xmath15 .",
    "no nebular emission is present .",
    "_ fuse _ consists of four separate optical systems .",
    "two employ lif optical coatings and are sensitive to wavelengths from 990 to 1187  , while the other two use sic coatings , which provide reflectivity to wavelengths as short as 905  .",
    "the four channels overlap between 990 and 1070  .",
    "the _ fuse _ flux calibration , based on theoretical models of white - dwarf stellar atmospheres , is believed accurate to about 10% . for a complete description of _ fuse _ , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of zng  1 in m5 ( data set a1080303 ) was obtained in 4 separate exposures on 2000 july 15 . the total integration time was 3681 s , all of it during orbital night .",
    "all observations were made through the 30  @xmath16 30  ( lwrs ) aperture .",
    "fuv images of the cluster core confirm that no other uv - bright stars fell within the spectrograph aperture .",
    "the data were reduced using version 2.3 of the calfuse calibration software pipeline . for each _ fuse _ channel , the spectra from individual exposures were cross - correlated , shifted to a common wavelength scale , weighted by their exposure time , and averaged . the spectrum from each channel",
    "was then cross - correlated with a synthetic molecular - hydrogen spectrum and shifted to match .",
    "the wavelength scale defined in this way is at rest with respect to the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which we take as a proxy for the local standard of rest .",
    "finally , the spectra were binned by four detector pixels , or about 0.025   , approximately half of the instrument resolution .",
    "model atmospheres are computed using the program tlusty @xcite , which employs a sophisticated treatment of non - lte ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) line blanketing to account for the opacity sources important in stellar atmospheres . in our models ,",
    "the line and continuum transitions of h , he , c , and n ( a total of 10 ions and 220 energy levels ) are treated in non - lte with detailed photoionization cross sections that include resonances ; other species , assumed to have scaled - solar abundances with [ fe / h ] equal to the cluster mean ( table [ obs_parms ] ) , are treated in lte .",
    "all models assume a microturbulent velocity of 2 km s@xmath6 .",
    "synthetic spectra are generated using the program synspec and rotationally broadened using the program rotin3 , which assumes constant limb darkening .",
    "the application of these codes to another sdo star , bd  @xmath17325 , is described in @xcite .",
    "model spectra are fit to the data using the nonlinear curve - fitting program specfit  @xcite , which performs a @xmath18 minimization of the model parameters .",
    "reddening is modeled with a @xcite extinction curve , extrapolated to the lyman limit , assuming @xmath19 )  = 0.03 ( table [ obs_parms ] ) and @xmath20  = 3.1 .",
    "error bars for a particular parameter are derived by fixing that parameter at the best - fit value , then raising it , while allowing the other model parameters to vary freely , until @xmath18 rises by 1 , which corresponds to a 1 @xmath21 deviation for a single interesting parameter @xcite .",
    "the error bars quoted in table [ stellar_parms ] are purely statistical and do not include systematic errors .      the most prominant feature in the _ fuse _ spectrum of zng  1 is the @xmath22  multiplet at 1175  .",
    "the half dozen individual lines of this feature are generally well resolved in _ fuse _ spectra , but in zng  1 are blended into a broad absorption trough . as shown in fig .",
    "[ carbon ] , this feature is well reproduced by a rotational velocity @xmath4  = 170 km s@xmath6 , a carbon mass fraction of 3% , an effective temperature @xmath0  = 45 kk , and a radial velocity @xmath23  = + 60 km s@xmath6 , a value consistent with the cluster velocity ( table [ obs_parms ] ) .",
    "we determine the star s surface gravity and helium abundance from simultaneous fits to its helium and hydrogen lines . as shown in fig .",
    "[ helium ] , every second  balmer line is paired with an  lyman line , but lies @xmath24   to the blue . the lines are unresolved because of the star s high rotational velocity , but our models show that these h - he blends shift to the blue as the helium abundance rises and the hydrogen abundance falls .",
    "( note that the stellar features are redshifted relative to the ism . ) though the cores of all three features are contaminated  the h - he blends by interstellar  and the  @xmath25 line by from the stellar wind",
    " their wings can constrain both the stellar surface gravity and the helium abundance .",
    "we model the region between 930 and 940  , excluding the cores of all three stellar features ( fig .  [ helium ] ) .",
    "( model fits to the ism lines confirm that all regions of significant foreground  absorption are excluded . )",
    "the remaining interstellar lines are fit with simple gaussians .",
    "we generate a grid of models with surface gravities @xmath2  = 4.0 , 4.5 , and 5.0 and helium fractions from 10 to 90% ( in steps of 10% ) by number . within specfit , we linearly interpolate between models to produce a fine grid with steps of 0.1 dex in @xmath2 . assuming @xmath0  = 45 kk and @xmath23  = + 60 km s@xmath6 , we find a surface gravity of @xmath26 and a helium fraction of @xmath27% by number . repeating this test with @xmath0  = 46 kk models yields best - fit values of @xmath28 and a helium fraction of @xmath27% ,",
    "so we need not increase our error bars to account for small uncertainties in the effective temperature .",
    "given the low hydrogen abundance of this star , we quote all abundances as mass fractions ; that of helium is @xmath29% ( table  [ stellar_parms ] ) .    adopting these stellar parameters , we fit model spectra to four photospheric nitrogen features , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( red wing ) , and @xmath33 , and derive an effective temperature of @xmath0  = @xmath1 k and a nitrogen mass fraction of @xmath34%",
    ". fits to three of these lines are presented in fig .",
    "[ carbon ] .",
    "the giants in m5 show a wide range of nitrogen abundances , the highest being [ n / fe ] = + 1.38 @xcite , but the nitrogen abundance of zng  1 is 4 times greater . returning to the @xmath22  multiplet",
    ", we obtain a rotational velocity @xmath35 km s@xmath6  and a carbon mass fraction of @xmath36% , more than 160 times greater than the most carbon - rich cluster giant studied by @xcite .",
    "the star s _ fuse _  spectrum shows no strong oxygen features , so we fit the wavelength region between 1090 and 1104  , where the continuum is fairly flat and where numerous weak and lines combine to form two broad absorption troughs centered at 1093 and 1099  .",
    "we derive an oxygen mass fraction of @xmath37% .",
    "while the oxygen abundance is the least well - determined of the cno abundances in zng  1 , it is certainly larger than the maximum value observed in m5 giants , where [ o / fe ] ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the star also appears to be enhanced in s , si , and p ; we will determine their abundances in a future paper .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of zng  1 shows broad p - cygni profiles and blueshifted discrete absorption components ( dacs ) in both components of the  doublet .",
    "the  profiles are well fit by models with a terminal velocity of @xmath40  = 1000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the dacs , which are generally attributed to density enhancements in the stellar wind , are blueshifted by 960 km s@xmath6  relative to the star , consistent with the dacs seen by ghrs @xcite .",
    "the spectrum also shows narrow absorption features of , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 blueshifted by @xmath14 120 km s@xmath6  relative to the ism and @xmath14 180 km s@xmath6  relative to the star ( two blue - shifted  features are marked in fig .  [",
    "helium ] ; see also fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "these features may represent a shell of material expanding about the star .",
    "a complete analysis of the star s wind and shell features is forthcoming .      using the cluster distance and",
    "the ratio of observed to synthetic spectra @xcite , we derive a stellar luminosity @xmath7 .",
    "the star lies on the @xcite pagb evolutionary tracks and should have a mass @xmath44 .",
    "the mass calculated from the parameters of our best - fit model , @xmath45 , is consistent with the schnberner prediction .",
    "hot pagb stars in globular clusters differ from their field counterparts in that they rarely show evidence for third dredge - up ( by which the products of helium burning are brought to the surface ) and are seldom accompanied by pne @xcite .",
    "these characteristics can be understood qualitatively as a result of the expected low core mass ( @xmath46 ) of globular cluster agb stars . while the minimum core mass for third dredge - up is still a subject of active research @xcite ,",
    "nearly all current agb models agree that third dredge - up should not occur in stars with initial mass @xmath47 .",
    "the rarity of pne can be explained by the lower luminosities and longer crossing times of pagb stars with low core masses ; the nebula disperses before the central star becomes hot enough to ionize it @xcite .",
    "@xcite therefore suggest that binary evolution is necessary for the formation of pne in globular clusters .",
    "interestingly , the best - studied pn in a globular cluster , k648 in m15 , shows clear evidence for third dredge - up in its central star @xcite , but not the strong helium and nitrogen enhancements seen in zng  1 .",
    "one way to produce a hydrogen - deficient star with enhanced cno abundances is for the star to experience a very late shell flash while descending the white dwarf cooling curve and subsequently return to the agb @xcite .",
    "this `` born - again '' scenario might explain the absence of a pn surrounding zng  1 , because the star is so old ( since it is on a second crossing ) , that any nebula has long since dispersed . for the born - again scenario to work for zng  1 , the hydrogen must not be completely burned , and the carbon enhancement must not be too high . @xcite provide a born - again model of an initial 1 @xmath48 star with z = 0.001 that predicts stellar parameters similar to those of zng  1 ( see their table 3 ) , although the cno abundances are about a factor of three larger .",
    "the difficulty with the born - again scenario ( or any single - star evolution scenario ) is providing an explanation for the observed rapid rotation .",
    "one possibility : to explain the observed rotational velocity of up to 40 km s@xmath6  in some globular horizontal - branch stars @xcite , @xcite postulate that red giants may have a rapidly rotating core .",
    "if so , then perhaps its angular momentum can be transferred to the surface during the convective mixing in the final shell flash .    might the properties of zng  1 be explained through interaction with another star ?",
    "first , we note that its very blue  color indicates that any current companion must be quite faint .",
    "given the proximity of the star to the projected cluster center ( 42 ) and the moderately high stellar interaction rate in m5 @xcite , one possiblity is a stellar collision , which is thought to be the primary production mechanism for the blue stragglers found at the centers of globular clusters .",
    "collisionally - created blue stragglers are expected to be born with a high angular momentum .",
    "@xcite measure a rotation rate of @xmath49 km s@xmath6  and estimate a mass of @xmath50 for a blue straggler in 47 tuc .",
    "a star of this mass would likely experience third dredge - up on the agb , but would also be expected to eject a pn , which is not seen for zng  1 .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear how much of a blue straggler s angular momentum would survive its post - main sequence evolution .",
    "a second scenario , in which a low - mass companion spirals into the agb progenitor , has been proposed to explain k648 in m15 by @xcite and discussed in general by @xcite .",
    "the increased agb mass due to the ingestion of the companion might be sufficient to allow third dredge - up to occur , but additional mechanisms such as shear or rotationally - induced mixing are required to create a hydrogen - deficient star @xcite .",
    "a merger process is thought to be the origin of the high rotational velocity of fk comae stars ( @xmath51 km s@xmath6  for the prototype fk comae ; @xcite ) .",
    "more detailed analysis is required to assess the viability of a merger scenario for zng  1 ; whether the merger remnant should eject a pn is of particular interest .",
    "@xcite compute terminal velocities and mass - loss rates for the winds of ( pop .",
    "i ) central stars of pne . assuming an evolutionary mass of 0.565 @xmath48 (  [ stellarparms ] ) and temperature of @xmath0  = 45 k , their models predict mass - loss rates of a few times @xmath52 @xmath48 yr@xmath6 . given this modest wind",
    ", it appears unlikely that zng  1 will dissipate significant angular momentum in the brief time ( @xmath53 years , according to the 0.565 @xmath48  track of @xcite ) prior to its arrival on the white - dwarf cooling curve .",
    "previous studies have yet to find white dwarfs with such rapid rotation ( see review by @xcite ) but the example of zng  1 suggests that further searches may be fruitful .",
