    "in the present paper , we deal with mutating genotypes . omitting the nature of these mutations",
    ", we suppose that they lead to a stochastic evolution of marks @xmath2 , given by brownian motion on @xmath14 with absorption at @xmath15 .",
    "we consider a birth - and - death stochastic dynamics of mutating genotypes .",
    "it means that at any random moment of time the existing genotype may disappear ( die ) from the configuration or may produce a new one .",
    "this new genotype will be placed at other location in the space .",
    "it has the parent s genotype at the moment of birth , but then it immediately involves in a mutation process .",
    "this may be understood as an expansion of genotypes along the space .",
    "the probabilistic rates of birth and death of a genotype are independent of the rest of configuration , however , we suppose that they depend on sizes of genotypes .",
    "in fact , it means that we have selection in rates of birth and death .",
    "it is natural for biological systems that genotypes with very shot as well as very long length have less possibilities for surviving and reproduction , see e.g. @xcite .    the heuristic markov generator of the dynamics described above may be given by @xmath16    the first term in describes the birth of genotypes .",

    "the third term describes mainly mutations of genotypes , but also can include all random changes within the genotype , such as : duplication , genetic drift , etc .",
    "this differential operator is a modification of the generator for a random jump mutation model on the continuous space .",
    "let us note that the third term is the direct sum of operators .",
    "that means that we assume that each offspring develops independently on others and we do not consider any interaction between existing genotypes .",
    "note that models of this type ( without expansion ) , so - called mutation - selection models , play an important role in analysis of many problems of population genetics , see e.g. @xcite .    to give a rigorous meaning to the expression we consider the following classes of functions .",
