    "one of the most interesting results of recent  surveys with   and  consists in the discovery of a large number of sources with `` peculiar '' properties , i.e. , not straightforwardly associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "in particular , two classes of sources will be discussed in the following : ( a ) sources with high x - ray - to - optical flux ratios ( x / o ) and ( b )  bright optically normal galaxies ( xbongs ) .",
    "-band magnitude for sources detected by recent  surveys [ large symbols at bright  fluxes : hellas2xmm results ; small symbols at faint  fluxes :  deep field - north and south @xcite , lockman hole @xcite , elais @xcite ] .",
    "the squares indicate the sources classified as xbongs .",
    "`` normal '' agn typically populate the shaded region ( within @xmath2).,width=287 ]    the fraction of this source population among  selected samples is @xmath3  20% and constant over a broad range of  fluxes [ e.g. , @xcite ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it appears evident that a significant fraction of these high x / o sources ( typically those at @xmath4 ) can not be spectroscopically identified even with 10-m class telescopes .",
    "we took advantage of the relatively bright  flux limit of the hellas2xmm survey [ @xmath5  10@xmath6   @xmath7 ; see @xcite for details ] and , therefore , of the bright magnitudes of most of the optical counterparts , to shed light on the nature of these sources .",
    "we proceed through a two - steps method : firstly , we used fors1 at the very large telescope ( vlt ) to identify through spectroscopy the most luminous ( @xmath8 ) members of this population . of the whole sample of 28 high x / o sources in the hellas2xmm 1df , 13 were targeted @xcite .",
    "eight sources , at @xmath9  12 , match the type  2 quasar optical definition ( i.e. , luminous sources with high - ionization , narrow emission lines ) .",
    "four sources are broad - line ( type  1 ) agn , while the remaining object is a moderate - luminosity emission - line galaxy .    from the  perspective ,",
    "these objects match also the most widely accepted  definition of type  2 quasars , i.e. , they are luminous and absorbed [ ; @xcite ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] two examples of type  2 quasars from the hellas2xmm surveys are shown .",
    "all the emission lines have fwhm@xmath101,500  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "further information on the broad - band properties of these objects will be obtained with the planned sub - mm and near - infrared observations .",
    "overall , although recent  [ e.g. , @xcite ] and optical surveys [ @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ] have proven to be effective in the detection of many type  2 quasars , much work needs to be done at the faintest optical magnitudes .",
    "the second step of our approach addresses this point .",
    "eleven faint ( @xmath12 ) high x / o sources were observed with isaac at the vlt in the @xmath13 band .",
    "bright ( @xmath14 ) counterparts for 10 sources were found .",
    "all the counterparts have extremely red colors ( @xmath15 ) ; in particular , 7 sources are associated with massive bulge - dominated galaxies and have estimated redshifts in the range [ see @xcite for details ] .",
    "since these objects are highly luminous and absorbed in the  band , they show _ how effective the hard are in tracing obscured quasar accretion in massive ellipticals at _ .",
    "two of the remaining counterparts are point - like , possibly agn at , and only one object has a disk morphology ( at @xmath9  0.8 ) .",
    "although the xbongs do not represent a new source population [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] , only in the last few years it has become possible to unveil a significant number of these sources which were marginally represented by a few cases in past studies . since the identification of the first xbong detected in hard [ the source p3 in @xcite and @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ] , many more have been discovered ( at @xmath9  01 ) and studied .",
    "these sources are characterized by the lack of evident agn signatures in moderate - quality optical spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for four examples from the hellas2xmm survey ) , although provide indications for powerful , not necessarily obscured , agn emission .",
    "several interpretations have been proposed to explain the observed properties of xbongs , in particular : ( a ) they are the higher redshift counterparts of local compton - thick galaxies @xcite .",
    "this has been suggested by the close resemblance of the spectral energy distribution of some xbongs to that of the local compton - thick galaxy ngc  6240 ; ( b ) the lack of spectral features at optical wavelengths is due to a combination of wide slits , limited - bandpass , low - resolution , and low signal - to - noise ratio spectra having the effect of diluting the nuclear emission ( especially in the case of a low - luminosity agn ) by the host galaxy starlight [ @xcite ; see also @xcite ] ; ( c ) the xbongs are powered by advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) which are not effective in the production of the emission lines @xcite ; ( d ) xbongs can possibly be associated with bl lac objects ; this seems to be a viable explanation in at least one case @xcite .",
    "whatever the explanation for the lack of spectral signatures , it appears difficult to ascribe their absence purely to the quality and bandpass of the observations .",
    "although the dilution of the nuclear emission by the host galaxy could play an important role , it is a fact that the upper limits on typical agn emission lines ( i.e. , [ oiii ] and h@xmath16 ) measured in the fairly good signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the xbongs sampled by hellas2xmm ( see fig .",
    "3 ) are an order of magnitude less than the fluxes expected from the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "-band images of the four xbongs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] obtained with isaac at the vlt ( seeing@xmath3  0.45 ) .",
    "the two galaxies of the interacting system are separated by 0.9 , corresponding to @xmath3  3.5  kpc.,width=340 ]    finally , further evidence of the large variety in the properties of xbongs comes from near - infrared ( nir ) imaging [ see fig .  [ fig4 ] and @xcite ] . despite the optical spectra , which are all typical of early - type galaxies ,",
    "the nir images show different morphologies : two are ellipticals , one is a barred spiral , and one consists of two close interacting galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . ) further broad - band studies and , possibly , a more effective definition of `` xbongness '' ( e.g. , a limit to the equivalent width of any optical emission line ) are required to understand this `` exotic '' source population in more detail .",
