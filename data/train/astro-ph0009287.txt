    "the most well - known , modern method of using color selection to find high - redshift galaxies is the lyman - break technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this method has isolated large numbers of galaxies at @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the great efficiency of the lyman - break technique in selecting high - redshift candidates for follow - up spectroscopy from visible wavelength colors has made it easier to preselect samples of @xmath12 galaxy candidates than galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "a complimentary technique to preselect @xmath0 galaxy candidates is to use a combination of near - infrared ( nir ) and visible wavelength photometry to search for extremely red objects ( eros ) , which have large visible  nir colors @xcite .",
    "a sample of galaxies at @xmath0 can test galaxy evolution theories by measuring both the surface density of these galaxies and the relative fraction of different spectrophotometric types .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the passive evolution model postulates that galaxies assembled at @xmath15 and the comoving space density of bright galaxies at @xmath0 should be comparable to the local value ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite showed that hierarchical galaxy formation predicts a significantly smaller fraction of @xmath0 galaxies in a @xmath2-selected redshift survey relative to passive galaxy evolution .",
    "@xmath16band selection is particularly sensitive to differences between these two galaxy formation models because it measures the old stellar population that dominates the mass , rather than recent starbursts which may enhance the luminosity at visible wavelengths .",
    "several @xmath2-selected redshift surveys have indeed found smaller numbers of @xmath17 galaxies than predicted by passive evolution , in support of the hierarchical galaxy formation picture @xcite .",
    "well - studied eros to date are all at @xmath18 and appear to be either old ellipticals or dusty starbursts .",
    "however , eros are generally classified as `` ellipticals '' because their rest - frame visible spectrum is dominated by an old stellar population , rather than on the basis of kinematic or surface brightness criteria .",
    "old ellipticals at these redshifts have very red colors because the 4000   break falls between the @xmath19 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "dusty starbursts have similarly extreme colors due to a combination of the balmer continuum break and the relative suppression of the @xmath20 light from young stars by dust .",
    "the first deep sky survey at @xmath2 by @xcite found 2 eros , which additional photometry and spectroscopy showed were old ellipticals at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "several more eros were found by @xcite in a @xmath2 imaging survey of the fields of high - redshift radio galaxies and two eros were found by @xcite in an imaging survey of a @xmath22 quasar field .",
    "one of these , hr10 , has a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath23 and has since been detected at radio @xcite and submillimeter @xcite wavelengths .",
    "these observations provide strong evidence that hr10 is a dusty starburst galaxy .",
    "another well - studied ero , lbds 53w091 , was discovered in a nir study of a sample of weak radio sources .",
    "spectroscopy by @xcite showed that it is an old , red galaxy at @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite observed the ero cl  0939 + 4713b , serendipitously discovered by @xcite , and found it is an old elliptical at @xmath25 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of hr10 , lbds 53w091 , cl  0939 + 4713b , and others show that eros are at @xmath18 and either appear as old ellipticals or dusty starbursts .",
    "the definition of what constitutes an ero is highly variable and cuts in color include @xmath26 , 5.3 , and 6 and @xmath27 .",
    "recent surveys for eros have mapped large areas of the sky at nir wavelengths to statistically study the ero population @xcite .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically followed up a sample of nine eros and found that two are dusty starbursts and the remaining seven are consistent with passively evolved ellipticals . @xcite",
    "have obtained spectra of four of the 19 eros in the caltech faint galaxy redshift survey and all appear to be ellipticals with little dust .",
    "this spectroscopic work indicates that most eros are ellipticals , rather than dusty starbursts .",
    "while the larger ero samples only include imaging , @xcite showed that the eros in their 700 arcmin@xmath6 survey are strongly clustered and their surface density can be used to test galaxy formation models .",
    "the clustering of eros helps to explain the dispersion in measurements of the ero surface density for a fixed color and magnitude threshold .",
    "this survey for eros is based on the visible and nir imaging of the deep multicolor survey ( dms ) described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the original dms included @xmath28 photometry of 6 high - galactic latitude fields over a total area of 0.83 deg@xmath29 .",
    "the dms has been used to study the luminosity function of quasars @xcite , galactic stars @xcite , the luminosity function of galaxies @xcite , and nir @xmath30 number counts @xcite . in this paper",
    "i discuss the nature of the nine objects with @xmath4 and @xmath5 mag in the dms and the implications of the ero surface density for galaxy evolution models .",
    "  [ sec : phot ] and [ sec : select ] briefly describe the photometry and object selection . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] i use colors and model fits to the 9-filter spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to compute redshifts and classify the eros as either ellipticals or dusty starbursts .",
    "these results are discussed in  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the observations , data reduction , and photometric solutions for these observations are described in @xcite and @xcite . to measure the objects detected in the nir frames ( plate scale of @xmath31 pix@xmath32 ) on the ccd data ( @xmath33 pix@xmath32 ) , i used the dms stellar catalog @xcite to solve for the coordinate transformations using geotrans in iraf .",
    "the photometric zeropoints for each of the 21 fields was determined with the dms stellar catalog for the ccd images and the photometric solutions from @xcite for the nir images .",
    "because the subfields with nir data are small , variations in the psf across the ccd fields described by @xcite are negligible over these individual subfields . for the ccd fields with more than one nir subfield , the variation in the photometric zeropoint for different regions of the same ccd image was @xmath34 mag or less .",
    "i measured the brightness of each object using aperture photometry and a stellar - profile aperture correction .",
    "the main purpose of these measurements is to accurately determine the colors of the galaxies , rather than their total integrated brightness in each filter .",
    "the same size aperture will sample the same physical region in each galaxy and provide a better estimate of the shape of the sed than methods such as isophotal magnitudes , which will depend on the isophotal limit in each filter .",
    "variations in seeing from filter to filter can complicate this issue as a larger fraction of the light within a fixed physical radius will fall outside the aperture if the seeing fwhm is larger . the optimal aperture for these measurements will be a compromise between a decrease in aperture size , which will increase the signal - to - noise ratio , and an increase in the uncertainty of the stellar aperture correction . while the image quality is on average superior in the nir frames relative to the ccd data , the nir fields are significantly smaller ( 9 arcmin@xmath6 compared to 225 arcmin@xmath6 ) and",
    "generally only have one or two stars of sufficient brightness to determine the seeing and aperture correction .",
    "the nir frames were therefore the limiting factor in minimizing the aperture size . to derive the optimal aperture i measured the aperture correction in the nir frames at a range of radii from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "i found that for @xmath37 the uncertainty in the aperture correction for many of the frames was comparable or greater than the photometric errors at @xmath38 mag .",
    "i therefore chose to use an @xmath39 aperture for the photometry .    to measure the amount of lost light from a galaxy in excess of the stellar aperture correction , i simulated measurements of exponential disks and @xmath40 profiles with half - light radii @xmath41 , @xmath35 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 over the range of seeing from @xmath43 to @xmath44 fwhm exhibited by these images following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "this range of possible ero angular sizes span that found by @xcite in their study of eros with _",
    "hst _ imaging . for an @xmath39 aperture , the galaxy light lost in addition to the stellar aperture correction ranges from essentially zero for @xmath41 to 0.2 mag for an @xmath45 exponential disk and 0.25 mag for an @xmath45 @xmath40 profile .",
    "nir imaging surveys for eros have defined numerous selection criteria @xcite , including objects with @xmath46 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath2 magnitude upper limits from 18 to 20 mag .",
    "an extreme red color is a fairly efficient means of selecting candidate galaxies at @xmath0 because it brackets the 4000   break in ellipticals and the balmer continuum plus reddening in dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "this color space could also be inhabited by late - type stars , emission line galaxies , or very high redshift ( @xmath47 ) galaxies , where the lyman continuum falls between @xmath19 and @xmath2 .",
    "stellar contamination is probably the dominant contaminant in ero samples and can be avoided by including only resolved sources . the upper limit in magnitude , which is approximately the spectroscopic limit of the largest current telescopes , avoids `` contamination '' of the @xmath0 sample by galaxies at higher redshift as they have much lower surface densities than @xmath0 objects at these magnitude limits .",
    "for example , a @xmath48 mag galaxy at @xmath49 has an absolute magnitude @xmath50 + log @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , two magnitudes brighter than @xmath54 + log @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 galaxies in a survey to @xmath55 mag will therefore mostly be at @xmath56 due to the exponential decline in the galaxy luminosity function .    for this study",
    "i have adopted @xmath57 , @xmath58 mag to select for eros in the dms sample .",
    "the @xmath58 mag limit is brighter than at least the @xmath41 completeness limit for nearly all 185 arcmin@xmath6 of the @xmath2 survey @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 was suggested by @xcite based on models of ellipticals and dusty starbursts as well as observations of known eros at @xmath0 . in total , nine resolved objects in the dms sample met these two selection criteria for a surface density of 0.05 arcmin@xmath10 .",
    "this surface density is a lower limit due to the variation in detection efficiency for different galaxy sizes and from field to field .",
    "the photometry for the eros is listed in table  [ tbl : phot ] .",
    "the only correction that has been applied to the apparent magnitudes in table  [ tbl : phot ] is a stellar aperture correction .",
    "as these measurements may underestimate the total integrated brightness , this survey may underestimate the true ero surface density ( see   [ sec : dis ] ) .",
    "colors are one means of breaking the degeneracy between ellipticals and starbursts .",
    "the sed of an elliptical galaxy at @xmath0 drops off sharply at the 4000   break between the @xmath19 and @xmath2 bands , while the sed of a dusty starburst declines more gradually due to reddening . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", observations between the @xmath19 and @xmath2 bands , such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , or @xmath62 can be used to measure the sharpness of the spectral break and thus discriminate between these two scenarios . by this argument , ellipticals appear bluer in @xmath8 than dusty starbursts .",
    "figure  [ fig : rjk ] shows @xmath63 vs.  @xmath8 for the galaxies in table  [ tbl : phot ] ( _ open circles _ ) , where ellipticals lie to the left , towards bluer @xmath8 colors , and dusty starbursts to the right , towards redder @xmath8 colors .",
    "@xcite convolved a range of models and observed galaxy spectral energy distributions with @xmath19 , @xmath59 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 filters and found that ellipticals and dusty starbursts separate in the @xmath64 vs.  @xmath8 plane and @xmath63 vs.  @xmath8 plane .",
    "their relation between @xmath63 and @xmath8 is shown in figure  [ fig : rjk ] , along with their suggested @xmath57 selection criterion ( _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "this color space does successfully classify three eros from the literature with spectroscopic classifications , visible , and nir photometry ( _ open triangles _ ) : hr10 @xcite , lbds 53w091 @xcite , and cl0939 + 4713b @xcite .",
    "it is possible , however , that galaxies with a mix of old stars and dusty star formation could fall into either class on this diagram .",
    "for example , @xcite found evidence of this in their study of eros associated with radio - loud quasars , where objects best fit by star formation and dust still had relatively blue @xmath8 colors .",
    "of the nine dms eros shown in the figure , seven have colors consistent with elliptical galaxies and two are consistent with dusty starbursts .",
    "however , six of the eros fall within @xmath65 of the dividing line between these two classes and therefore either interpretation is consistent with the photometry .",
    "= 3.5truein      photometric redshifts with sed template fits are one way to expand on simpler color discrimination techniques and solve for both the object redshift and spectrophotometric galaxy type .",
    "photometric redshifts that fit sed templates to photometric data rely on three pieces of information : a template sed for the source object , the relative transmission of the system ( filter , detector , and optics ) in each band , and a measurement of the source brightness in that band . of these three quantities",
    ", the system transmission profile should be the best - known quantity , in principle , and the true galaxy sed the most uncertain .",
    "the templates used in photometric redshift codes are either empirical seds , such as the set compiled by @xcite , or spectral synthesis templates , such as those based on the bruzual & charlot evolutionary code ( e.g. gissel98 , * ? ? ?",
    "photometric redshift codes are most accurate in the @xmath0  2 range when nir photometry is available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at this range of redshifts , the strongest spectral feature , the 4000 break , has shifted into the nir region and the lyman continuum has not yet shifted into the ground - based @xmath66 filter bandpass .",
    "using mock galaxy catalogs produced with _ hyperz _",
    "@xcite , i measured the accuracy of the photometric redshift measurements for a @xmath5 mag galaxy sample with the same magnitude limits and noise properties as this survey in all nine filters . for a uniform distribution in redshifts ,",
    "the scatter is @xmath67 .",
    "the scatter for galaxies with @xmath68 is @xmath69 , compared to @xmath70 for the same sample if only @xmath28 photometry were available .",
    "the accuracy of photometric redshifts , and the associated best - fit templates , depends on photometric quality as well as the number of filters . while the eros are all expected to be at @xmath18 due to their @xmath63 colors , they are often undetected in several filters ( none are detected in @xmath66 or @xmath71 ) and the photometric uncertainties in the remaining filters are generally @xmath72 mag .",
    "the larger the photometric errors , the less well contrained the best - fit redshift , and particularly the best - fit galaxy template .    the empirical galaxy templates in _ hyperz _ are from @xcite and represent the local galaxy population .",
    "the gissel98 galaxy templates are the 1998 update of the spectral synthesis models described by @xcite .",
    "all of the models have solar metallicity and a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "each model corresponds to a different present - day spectrophotometric galaxy type .",
    "the elliptical template has all star formation occurring at high redshift and thus represents classic passive luminosity evolution .",
    "the burst model represents the opposite extreme with significant recent star formation .",
    "the remaining galaxy types are represented by exponentially decaying star formation with different @xmath73folding timescales .",
    "i used _ hyperz _ to find the best - fit empirical galaxy template , gissel98 elliptical template , and gissel98 starburst templates for each of the eros listed in table  [ tbl : phot ] .",
    "the basic operation of this code is to take a series of input galaxy templates , vary the redshift and amount of reddening , and solve for the best combination of these quantities that match an input catalog of photometric measurements or upper limits .",
    "for these model fits i adopted the @xcite reddening law . while there are a large number of filters predefined in _",
    "hyperz _ , the dms @xmath74 and @xmath75 filters are not included .",
    "because of the importance of the system transmission profiles in each band , i added the profiles of the dms filters from @xcite , which include the detector response , and scans of the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath2 filters from tifkam , which i convolved by a measurement of the atmospheric transmission at kitt peak .",
    "= 4truein = 4truein    in all cases the photometric redshift predictions of the three fits shown in table  [ tbl : zphot ] are similar .",
    "one feature of the sed fits to these eros is that on average the best - fit elliptical template has a lower photometric redshift than the best starburst template .",
    "this is because the dominant break in the sed of elliptical galaxies is at 4000  while the closest spectral break in starburst galaxies is the balmer continuum at 3650  .",
    "the rms scatter in the photometric redshift prediction for these three fits is @xmath76 .",
    "the photometric redshifts are thus quite robust and show clearly that these eros are @xmath18 galaxies .",
    "the relative quality of the three sed fits is comparable , with the difference between the fits @xmath77 .",
    "these galaxies can therefore not be reliably classified as either ellipticals or dusty starbursts due to the large photometric errors .",
    "most of the best fits with the @xcite empirical seds are the elliptical template with no dust or spirals with some dust .",
    "these fits suggest that most eros are ellipticals , although old stellar populations at @xmath0 are on order half the age of old stellar populations at @xmath78 and thus this empirical sed may not be an accurate representation of @xmath79 ellipticals .",
    "the gissel98 models do take the change in the age of the universe with redshift into account .",
    "the gissel98 elliptical templates fit the data with only a small amount of extinction , while the starburst models require on average @xmath80 mag .",
    "the reported surface density of eros has a large dispersion . @xcite found two galaxies with @xmath26 and @xmath5 mag in 10 arcmin@xmath6 for a surface density of 0.2  arcmin@xmath10 .",
    "figure  1 of @xcite shows they found seven of these objects for a surface density of 0.05  arcmin@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite surveyed 700  arcmin@xmath29 and derived a surface density of @xmath81 arcmin@xmath10 for @xmath26 and @xmath5 mag .",
    "their study also showed that eros are clustered , which helps to explain the dispersion in measurements of the surface density . in this survey",
    "i have identified nine eros with @xmath4 and @xmath5 mag , which corresponds to a surface density of 0.049@xmath82 arcmin@xmath10 , where these uncertainties only correspond to the @xmath65 confidence limits @xcite .",
    "this surface density is nearly a factor of two higher than the surface density of 0.027 arcmin@xmath10 found by @xcite for @xmath4 and @xmath5 mag ( see table  [ tbl : sigma ] ) , although based on poisson statistics these measurements are marginally consistent at the @xmath65 level .",
    "in addition to the random errors due to counting statistics , eddington bias and light lost outside the @xmath39 aperture could systematically lower and raise the measured surface density , respectively .",
    "eddington bias is important near the detection limit when objects with a steep number  magnitude relation are preferentially scattered into the sample and artificially enhance the observed space density .",
    "based on the surface density vs. magnitude measurements published by @xcite , the slope of the ero number  magnitude relation ( for @xmath4 ) is @xmath83 at @xmath55 mag .",
    "the correction for the eddington bias is @xmath84 and for a mean photometric uncertainty of @xmath85 , the surface density may be overestimated by approximately 2% . if the slope were a factor of two steeper , the overestimate is still less than 10% .",
    "a more significant potential source of error arises if the eros are large galaxies and a @xmath39 aperture misses some fraction of their light .",
    "then the surface density has been underestimated as effectively the photometric scale assigns them too faint a magnitude , thus the surface density at @xmath86 mag is really the surface density at @xmath87 mag .",
    "the increase in surface density scales as @xmath88 , where for example @xmath89 ( @xmath90 for an exponential or @xmath40 profile ) corresponds to an increase of 50% , although a significant contribution from such large eros appear to be ruled out by observations @xcite .",
    "while clustering will not change the true mean surface density , it will increase the possible variation from survey to survey over the pure poisson uncertainties quoted above .",
    "the dms eros are clearly strongly clustered as , for example , five of these objects are in one of the subfields in field01w ( 01wc , 01wc150w , and cf3 ) , only 20% of the total area with nir data .",
    "the rms number counts of eros in the dms are @xmath91 , compared to @xmath92 for a surface density of @xmath93  arcmin@xmath6 and an average area per field of 9  arcmin@xmath6 .",
    "if i adopt the correlation amplitude @xmath94 from @xcite for @xmath26 , @xmath5  mag ( they had insufficient statistics to measure this quantity at @xmath4 ) the predicted rms counts @xcite are @xmath95 .",
    "the clustering signal in this suvey may be exaggerated by variations in the field to field sensitivity .",
    "the high surface density of eros in this and other surveys provides a constraint for passive evolution and hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "hierarchical models predict relatively few large , bright galaxies at @xmath79 as most these galaxies assemble at @xmath96 . in a simple test of hierarchical galaxy formation",
    ", @xcite predicted that less that 1% of all galaxies with @xmath97 mag are at @xmath18 and @xmath98% of galaxies with @xmath99 mag are at @xmath18 ( see their figure  4 ) .",
    "measurements of the @xmath2 number  magnitude relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show the galaxy surface density is @xmath100 arcmin@xmath10 for galaxies with @xmath97 mag and @xmath101 arcmin@xmath10 for galaxies with @xmath99 mag . as all eros with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts",
    "are at @xmath18 , the surface density of eros can be taken as a lower limit to the surface density of all @xmath18 galaxies to test the @xcite prediction of hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "their predicted fraction of galaxies at @xmath18 implies that the surface density of eros should be @xmath102 arcmin@xmath10 for @xmath97 mag , in conflict with the higher value i measure and the value measured by @xcite .",
    "according the passive evolution model in @xcite , @xmath103 50% of all galaxies at @xmath5 mag are at @xmath104 , which corresponds to over an order of magnitude greater surface density of all @xmath104 galaxies than the ero surface density presented here , even if the ero surface density has been underestimated by as much as 50% due to lost light in the aperture .",
    "the ero surface density i measure and also the measurement of @xcite is still consistent with the results of @xmath2-selected spectroscopic and photometric redshift surveys @xcite , which have found a somewhat higher surface density of @xmath18 galaxies than the hierarchical model predictions .",
    "the cosmic variance between different redshift and ero surveys should be large given the clustering of eros .",
    "the redshift distribution from a spectroscopic survey is also most likely to be incomplete for the reddest and highest - redshift galaxies and could underestimate the @xmath0 contribution .",
    "eros provide such a good means to test the hierarchical galaxy formation model because their surface density is greater than the predicted surface density of all @xmath104 galaxies and they are only a lower limit on the total @xmath104 galaxy population in a @xmath16selected galaxy survey . from the discussion of the systematic uncertainties in the surface density above ,",
    "the overestimate due to eddington bias is less significant than an underestimate due to lost galaxy light and therefore 0.05 arcmin@xmath10 may be a lower limit to the true ero surface density .",
    "the surface density is therefore nearly a factor of three higher than the predicted surface density of all @xmath104 galaxies .",
    "two other effects could bring the ero surface density into better agreement with the hierarchical prediction , either by decreasing the observed number of eros or increasing their expected number .",
    "some fraction of eros appear to be dusty starburst galaxies , rather than old ellipticals . while this fraction is very likely less than 50% based on the colors of these eros and spectroscopic observations of ero samples from the literature @xcite , decreasing the surface density from this survey by a factor of two still yields a higher surface density of objects than the hierarchical model . a more important effect , however , is that the current model predictions from @xcite are for an @xmath105 universe . in a flat , @xmath11dominated universe , which appears to be the best fit cosmological model ,",
    "the comoving volume element vs.  redshift is larger than in a flat , matter - dominated universe .",
    "for example , at @xmath106 a given surface area on the sky corresponds to a factor of 2.8 ( @xmath107/@xmath108)@xmath109 more comoving volume in an @xmath110 universe than in an @xmath111 universe .",
    "the volume per unit area on the sky is greater and implies a larger surface density of high - redshift objects than the matter - dominated model considered by @xcite .",
    "the growth factor is also larger at fixed redshift in a @xmath11dominated universe than in an @xmath105 model , which implies more large structures have formed and consequently a larger space density and surface density of bright galaxies .",
    "the increase in surface density due to the change from a matter - dominated to a @xmath11dominated universe is partially offset , however , by the increase in the luminosity distance .    in this paper",
    "i have presented a new measurement of the ero surface density and used photometric redshifts to show these objects are galaxies at @xmath104 .",
    "the surface density of eros is a lower limit to the total @xmath104 surface density , yet it is still a factor of three larger than the hierarchical galaxy formation model prediction for a matter - dominated universe .",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation in a @xmath11dominated universe , rather than a matter - dominated universe , could account for this discrepancy .",
