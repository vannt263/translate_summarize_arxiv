    "the commonly anticipated signal in radio searches for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) is a narrowband , slowly modulated signal of sustained duration . for example , bandwidths less than 1 hz and signal durations of days and longer are often hypothesized .",
    "these signal characteristics are closely related to the traditional requirement in science for _ repeatability _ of an experimental or observational result as well as to the hope that members of one class of eti signal  those that are targeted explicitly to us  will sustain themselves long enough to establish repeatability .",
    "by contrast with such an idealized type of signal , it is easy to imagine other kinds of received signals that depart significantly from the idealization , particularly with regard to duration and amplitude stability . moreover , several recent searches have found signals that are narrowband , do not match the characteristics of known , interfering signals of terrestrial or solar system origin , and yet , do not repeat when follow - up observations of the relevant sky positions are performed . the meta project ( @xcite ; hereafter hs93 ) found several dozen such signals at 1420 and 2840  mhz . similarly , serendip  iii has found @xmath2 transient candidate events at 430  mhz ( bowyer , werthimer , & donnelly  1994 ) .",
    "an older example of this kind is the `` wow ! '' signal found in the ohio state seti program at 1420  mhz ( @xcite ) . for meta",
    "the characteristic signal duration is no more than @xmath3 minute and all reobservation attempts  ranging from minutes to years after receipt of the original candidate signal  have failed .",
    "intense scrutiny of the wow sky position ( e.g. , @xcite ) has also failed to redetect a signal .",
    "a feature common to all seti programs is that , by virtue of the multidimensional search space ( direction , frequency , duration , etc . ) , large numbers of independent statistical tests are performed , typically @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "the aim is to separate noise , interference , and candidate real signals .",
    "this winnowing process is based on the rigorously known properties of background noise and on an ad hoc expert system designed to reject terrestrial signals which fail sidereal and doppler requirements that bona fide celestial signals must satisfy . as a result of the large number of trials",
    ", even pure noise can produce large amplitudes that are statistically highly improbable in a single trial .",
    "similarly , unusual interference , whether of natural or artificial origin , that fails to be identified by rejection algorithms can be recorded as candidate signals .    in this paper , we address signal intermittency in seti programs .",
    "our goals are to 1 ) develop the statistical apparatus for interpreting transient signals ; 2 ) assess surveys , particularly meta ( hs93 ) , that have yielded nonconfirmed events ; 3 ) prescribe optimal methods for reporting the results of ongoing seti programs ; and 4 ) improve the search protocols of future seti programs .",
    "a short list of possible explanations for intermittency includes :    1 .",
    "noise in the receiver electronics , including thermal noise , cosmic ray induced events , and hardware failures ; 2 .   radio frequency interference ( rfi ) whose origin is terrestrial , from earth orbit , or from interplanetary spacecraft ; 3 .",
    "natural , extrinsic modulation of narrowband astrophysical sources such as that caused by interstellar ( radio ) scintillation ( iss ) or gravitational lensing ; 4 .",
    "natural , extrinsic modulation of eti sources ; and 5 .",
    "intrinsic intermittency at the source of an eti signal due to natural causes , such as planetary rotation or the nature of the transmission ( e.g. , planetary radar ) or , for deliberate reasons , to frustrate detection and decryption by non - target civilizations .",
    "causes ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) are not dissimilar in their transmission properties though their sidereal and doppler properties may allow them to be distinguished . in this paper",
    ", we use a bayesian likelihood analysis as the apparatus for comparing cause ( 4 ) with several of the other , plausible explanations for signal intermittancy . our focus on cause ( 4 ) , with particular emphasis on iss , is motivated by two considerations .",
    "first , it is the simplest possible explanation for the transient behavior of signals that _ perhaps _ otherwise would be steady .",
    "second , iss is important at centimeter wavelengths ( @xcite ) that are commonly used in searches for eti .",
    "centimetric wavelengths are often favored because background noise levels are minimized relative to other wavelength bands and it is argued that spectral lines from hi and oh in this `` waterhole '' band serve as signpost or `` magic '' frequencies at which to transmit and receive ( @xcite ) .",
    "most importantly , however , we find that iss _ by itself _ is sufficient to explain the lack of confirmation of any eti candidate signals in surveys conducted to date .",
    "we consider iss at waterhole frequencies using the framework of cordes & lazio  ( 1991 ) and a recent model for galactic free electrons by taylor & cordes  ( 1993 ) .",
    "we show that the properties of scintillations expected from a galactic population of eti sources are intimately related to the _ number _ of such sources , if quasi - uniformly distributed , thought to exist in the galaxy .",
    "this follows because the time scale and characteristic bandwidth are strongly dependent on the distance of the source .",
    "in addition , the maximum increase in amplitude due to scintillation expected for any source is related to the number of statistical trials made and is therefore also related to the number of sources in the galaxy .    in previous papers ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite , hereafter cl91 , cl93 , & lc98 , respectively ) , we have emphasized the need for multiple observations of the sky in order to combat the effects of interstellar scintillations . in particular , we have found that the optimal number of observations of a specific direction is a few and that these can restore some of the detection probability that would be lost otherwise in a single pass on the sky . here , we focus on reobservations of an initial candidate detection and find a seemingly contradictory result : namely , that to rule out the reality of the candidate signal , it takes hundreds , if not thousands , of reobservations to do so .",

    "in cl91 , cl93 , & lc98 , we have described the impact upon source detection procedures resulting from radio waves propagating through a random , phase - changing medium , such as the ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) or the interplanetary medium ( ipm ) .",
    "the reader is directed to those papers for details on the salient features of scintillations ( also see @xcite ) . here",
    "we summarize scintillation phenomena that are relevant to our analysis .",
    "the scattering regime in which we are most interested is that which produces saturated intensity scintillations . in this _ strong scattering _",
    "case , intensity variations branch into two forms ( @xcite ) : fast , diffractive scintillations ( diss ) and slow , refractive scintillations ( riss ) .",
    "diss is manifested as 100% variations of the intensity in both time and frequency . the characteristic time and",
    "frequency scales are discussed below .",
    "riss typically shows 1020% variation on times scales of days to months and is correlated over a wide range of frequency . at centimeter wavelengths ,",
    "most of the galaxy is seen in the strong scattering regime . for sources near the sun ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath6 pc at 1  ghz , weak scintillations occur . a transition region extending to about 500  pc at 1  ghz produces scintillations with greater than 100% intensity variations ( c.f .",
    "lc98 ; @xcite ) . consequently , in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall concentrate on the impact of strong scattering on seti surveys done to date .",
    "also , we discuss only the effects of diss because modulations from it are orders of magnitude larger than those from riss in large - scale seti . while our interest here is primarily on _ intensity variations _ from interstellar scattering , phase fluctuations induced by the medium may also manifest themselves as _ doppler shifts _ or _",
    "frequency wandering _ of narrow spectral lines ( cl91 ) . in seti programs optimized for finding",
    "narrowband signals , follow - up observations on candidate signals need to account for the possibility that signals drift or shift in frequency on a variety of time scales .",
    "drifts may be caused by interstellar scattering , interplanetary scattering in the solar wind , and , presumably , in the stellar wind of the transmitting civilization s host star .",
    "these drifts are much less than the doppler shifts caused by the spin or orbital motion of a planet .",
    "nonetheless , they must be taken into account when making follow - up observations of candidate signals because they can still span several to many frequency bins of a narrow - band spectrometer .",
    "the intensity of a scintillating source is correlated on characteristic time and frequency scales : the scintillation time , @xmath7 , and the scintillation bandwidth , @xmath8 . for the vast majority of lines of sight ,",
    "the scintillation bandwidth exceeds the anticipated intrinsic widths of deliberately transmitted lines ( @xmath9 hz ) .",
    "in addition , broadening of the line by propagation effects is much less than 1 hz for most lines of sight .",
    "therefore , assuming intrinsic line widths are not substantially less than 1 hz , the line shape is essentially unaffected by scattering while the line amplitude is modulated for most lines of sight ( @xcite ; cl91 ) . when scintillations are saturated and the line shape undergoes negligible changes , the only astrophysically variable parameter is the scintillation time scale , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a characteristic transverse speed that is a combination of the velocities of the source , observer , and medium",
    "the time scale also depends on distance , with more distant sources having shorter time scale scintillations . for a medium with homogeneous statistics , @xmath12 ( cordes & lazio 1991 ) , but",
    "the dependence is more complex for a realistic model of the galaxy , as discussed below .",
    "the time scale has been measured to be seconds to hours for pulsars ( @xcite ) , whose transverse velocities dominate the relevant @xmath11 and are in the range of 30 to 2000 km s@xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by comparison , the motions of main sequence stars in the galaxy and the orbital motions of their planetary companions are much lower than the average pulsar speed .",
    "therefore , we expect that an eti source at the same distance as a given pulsar will show a characteristic scintillation time scale that is much longer than that seen from the pulsar , by typically an order of magnitude .",
    "we point out that differential galactic rotation does not play a large role because the scattering material also participates in the rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also emphasize that , as the scintillation time is frequency dependent , an assessment of the role of scintillations must take the observation frequency into account .    through modeling of the free electron density in the galaxy , it is possible to estimate the scintillation time scale for eti sources .",
    "the most recent model for the free electron density and its fluctuations ( @xcite ) incorporates all available data on pulsar distances and dispersion measures , and radio scattering data on pulsars , galactic maser sources , and extragalactic sources viewed through the ism .    figure  [ fig : cls_iss ] shows contours of the scintillation time @xmath7 for directions in the plane of the galaxy ( i.e. , galactic latitude @xmath14 ) .",
    "we have assumed a transverse speed @xmath15 km  s@xmath13 for all eti sources and an observation frequency of 1.42  ghz . given the range of possible orbital motions and motions in the galaxy , the effective velocity could vary by a factor of two or more , either lower or higher .",
    "it is evident that the scintillation time scale is of order minutes only for the most distant regions of the galaxy . for most directions , it is typically hours .",
    "the scintillation time scale , therefore , significantly exceeds the typical time spent on a given sky position in seti unless all sources are in the galactic plane at large distances .",
    "consequently , one may consider any putative ( intrinsically steady ) eti signal to be constant over the observation time , though scintillations may have modulated it significantly upward or downward in apparent strength relative to its long term mean",
    ". prompt repeat observations of a candidate signal made sooner than one diffraction time scale after an initial , tentative detection will `` see '' the same signal strength .",
    "conversely , repeated observations made at times when the scintillation modulations are mutually independent will detect a large range of signal strengths that follows the distribution of scintillation modulations . for saturated scintillations , this distribution is a one - sided exponential function .",
    "the reader may think that fig .",
    "[ fig : cls_iss ] can be used to dismiss immediately candidate signals in meta as being due to rfi , since they are not redetected immediately after their initial detections .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "as we show below , candidate signals can be detected in meta - like surveys as a _ combination _ of noise fluctuations and scintillations of celestial signals .",
    "the noise decorrelates immediately , so even a persistent source can disappear into the noise after an initial detection .",
    "figure  [ fig : cls_iss ] also shows the scintillation bandwidth , @xmath16 , at 1.42  ghz .",
    "the scintillation bandwidth is found to be much greater than the hypothesized signal bandwidth ( @xmath9 hz ) of deliberate eti signals for all lines of sight through the galaxy .",
    "the diffraction bandwidth scales with frequency as @xmath17 .",
    "the reciprocals of the scintillation time scale and bandwidth are also of potential interest , yielding the bandwidth of _ spectral broadening _ and the _ pulse - broadening _ time , respectively , as @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( e.g. , @xcite ; cl91 , cl93 ) .",
    "using values for the scintillation time scale @xmath7 from fig .",
    "[ fig : cls_iss ] , it is clear that spectral broadening @xmath20 hz at 1.42  ghz .",
    "this confirms our previous statement that line shapes are essentially unaltered by scattering if they are intrinsically wider than the spectral broadening from scattering .",
    "intensity statistics are discussed in appendix  [ app : stats ] . there",
    "we distinguish variations of the intensity over short time scales , when the scintillation modulation is constant , from those over long times when the modulation varies according to its exponential distribution ( in strong scattering ) . in the former case",
    "the intensity probability density function ( pdf ) is that for a phasor of constant amplitude @xmath21 combined with noise , where @xmath22 is the scintillation `` gain '' and @xmath23 is the source intensity in the absence of scintillations .",
    "the pdf @xmath24 is given in eq .",
    "[ eq : pdf ] , with @xmath25 . in the second case , where @xmath22 varies over its sample space ,",
    "the pdf , @xmath26 , is a simple , one - sided exponential with mean @xmath27 , where @xmath23 is assumed to be constant and @xmath28 is radiometer noise .",
    "each pdf implies a _ detection probability _ that the intensity exceeds a specified threshold intensity , @xmath29 .",
    "we call these @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and define them in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pd_nonscint])([eq : pd_scint ] ) . when there is no signal , just noise , @xmath32 , the detection probability is the false - alarm probability . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls_pd ] we show detection probabilities with and without scintillations for the case where the false - alarm probability is @xmath33 , corresponding to a threshold @xmath34 .",
    "recent seti programs do , in fact , achieve conformance to exponential statistics up to large thresholds such as this so long as terrestrial rfi is removed ( cf . figure 4 of hs93 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we reiterate a point discussed at length in our earlier papers : in the absence of scintillations , a source is essentially undetectable if @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "however , by the multiplicative nature of the scintillation gain , otherwise undetectable sources can be modulated above threshold . since",
    "@xmath22 is drawn from an exponential distribution , it can reach large values that result in a detection probability , @xmath37 , significantly in excess of its value in the absence of scintillations , @xmath38 .",
    "modulations which increase the signal strength are not the norm , though , and are in fact less likely than the converse .",
    "in contrast to our earlier papers ( cl91 , cl93 , lc98 ) , where we considered the probability of detecting a source at least once , in a survey , say , here we consider the probability of detecting a source at least twice , once in a survey and then again in a set of reobservations .",
    "appendix  [ app : stats ] also presents results on second - order statistics that we use in discussing correlations in scintillation gain between several observations of the same source .",
    "of particular interest is the conditional probability that a signal is detected in a second observation given that the intensity had the value @xmath39 in an initial `` detection , '' @xmath40)$ ] . here",
    "@xmath41 is the time interval between observations and @xmath42 is the autocorrelation function of the scintillation gain , normalized to @xmath43 .",
    "this function is gaussian - like in form and has a width equal to the characteristic ( diffractive ) scintillation time , @xmath7 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls_p2cond ] we show the conditional probability plotted against the correlation coefficient @xmath44 $ ] for several values of the normalized source strength @xmath45 , threshold @xmath46 , and intensity @xmath47 for an initial detection . as we discuss in  [ sec : bistatic ] , observations made at two different sites may also be analyzed using fig .",
    "[ fig : cls_p2cond ] . like two temporally - spaced observations ,",
    "the scintillation gain is partially correlated according to a spatial correlation function , @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cls_p2cond ] illustrates the importance of the combined effects of noise and scintillation . for values typical of meta , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the probability @xmath51 is less than unity for a nominally detectable signal , @xmath52 , even for perfectly correlated scintillation gains .",
    "if we suppose that the initial detection , @xmath53 , occurred because of the scintillation amplification of a weaker signal , e.g. , @xmath54 , the chances of _ not _ detecting the signal during reobservations are even greater . combinations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 can produce @xmath57 in some cases .",
    "we will demonstrate that , in large scale surveys involving large numbers of statistical trials , threshold crossings ( initial `` detections '' ) will occur through the combined effects of noise and scintillating phasors ( in the case where eti signals exist ! ) . because of this `` scintillation - noise conspiracy , '' _ confirmations _ of detected signals are difficult , owing to the rapid decorrelation of the noise on short time scales .",
    "thus , for large surveys with large detection thresholds , the probability of redetection is small and , therefore , the absence of confirming redetections is insufficient evidence for concluding the absence of a possibly steady eti signal .",
    "similarly , _ simultaneous _",
    "observations at two sites , where radiometer noise is uncorrelated , allow detection at one site and nondetection at the other with large probability .    qualitatively ,",
    "noise by itself  without aid from scintillation can also assist survey detection while inhibiting redetection .",
    "but quantitatively , for thresholds , candidate numbers , and numbers of reobservation trials like those in meta , it is difficult to explain noise - assisted survey detections combined with the failure of all reobservations .",
    "evidently , scintillations are needed to explain both .",
    "the reason lies in the difference in shapes of the detection probability curves in figure [ fig : cls_pd ] for intensity ratios @xmath58 .",
    "these , in turn , arise because , even though noise and scintillations both have one - sided exponential pdf s , they act asymmetrically because scintillations act multiplicativly on the true signal , while noise is additive .      if a candidate signal is also detected in the reobservation phase of a seti program , scintillations can serve to confirm that the candidate signal is in fact coming from beyond the solar system ( cf .",
    "the strength of a signal from a candidate source should vary from observation to observation in a manner consistent with the exponential distribution , provided the observations are separated by more than a scintillation time and , of course , that scintillations are strong .    in cl91 , we alluded to another scintillation phenomenon , _",
    "spectral wandering_. if observed over time periods shorter than the scintillation time , the centroid of a narrow - band signal will show random but correlated shifts in frequency in addition to any doppler shifts . if the signal is averaged over times much larger than the scintillation time , the signal will be spectrally broadened , i.e. , the spectral shape of the signal will converge to a gaussian - like shape with width @xmath59 ( cl91 ) .",
    "expressions are presented in cl91 for @xmath60 as a function of distance and frequency for both weak and strong scintillation regimes . for galactic sources ,",
    "we expect frequency wandering to be roughly the reciprocal of the scintillation time scale .",
    "reference to fig .",
    "[ fig : cls_iss ] shows that wandering will be at the level of @xmath61 to 0.1 hz . there are some directions for which the level of scattering is underestimated by the model used to construct fig .",

    ", the spectral wandering can exceed 0.1 hz .",
    "in this section , we show that the number of eti transmitters in the galaxy influences the expected distribution of source fluxes and determines the scintillation properties of the sources as manifested in a particular survey .",

    "part of the task of subsequent processing would be an assessment of whether excess hits above the background rate were statistically significant ( see  [ sec : pdfclean ] ) .",
    "the recommended procedure for dual - site observations is to report observations at low thresholds .",
    "this necessitates a large amount of storage for results in a dual - site search but raises the odds of a dual detection . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : pdfclean ] , there are additional reasons for reporting more measurements than are typically done in seti .    in the proposed beta survey , a billion channel spectrometer will be used in a two - feed antenna system so that a given sky position is viewed successively in the two beams ( hs93 ) .",
    "the time delay is of order minutes , so scintillating sources may or may not be correlated in the two beam measurements , depending on observation frequency and source distance .",
    "the odds for dual detections depend on the observing threshold according to our previous considerations , with lower thresholds preferred .",

    "iss influences interferometric observations by attenuating the visibility function by a factor @xmath402 , where @xmath70 is the interferometer baseline .",
    "the conventional detection method in seti and other astronomical surveys uses a threshold in signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) to define candidate signals .",
    "the false - alarm probability is often used to define the threshold in terms of the number of statistical trials made in the survey .    here",
    "we advocate an alternative method for seti that uses more information in the data and _ a priori _ knowledge about the noise statistics .",
    "this method allows lower signal levels to be probed than in the snr method .",
    "the scheme , first discussed by zepka , cordes & wasserman  ( 1994 ) for detecting x - ray sources in poisson backgrounds , looks for departures from the expected shape of the intensity ( or count - rate ) histogram .",
    "the stopping criterion is that sources are identified iteratively until the histogram of residual intensities is consistent with a noise - only histogram .",
    "for this reason , we refer to the method as `` pdfclean . ''    for interference - free and source - free observations , the _ a priori _ intensity pdf is given in eq .",
    "[ eq : pdf ] with @xmath135 , and is a one - sided exponential , @xmath403 .",

    "the pdfclean method therefore makes use of a _ probability threshold _ in place of an snr threshold in the snr method .",
    "once histogram bins are found in this way , they may be `` deconstructed '' to find the original sky positions and frequency channels of the contributing intensities .",
    "these may then be subjected to clustering tests to see if real celestial signals or terrestrial interference is the cause for departure .",
    "application of pdfclean requires substantial storage for raw data results because it can be used to probe intensities at lower snr than can the snr method itself .",
    "a discussion of actual storage requirements is given below .",
    "the payoff , however , is that real sources can be identified at low levels and the interference environment can be better understood as well .",
    "zepka et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show that the number of spurious detections ( e.g. , due to noise fluctuations ) is small using pdfclean .",
    "several lines of argument that we have presented lead to a primary recommendation for future seti : _ signal detections should be reported at much lower signal levels than have been used_. in programs like meta , where a large - scale survey is performed at one threshold with subsequent reobservations at a lower threhold , we argue that the reobservation threshold should be low enough to rule out our model  ii where survey candidates are hypothesized to be scintillating but otherwise constant sources . the cost of reporting lower signal levels is a larger recording rate and , possibly , a problematic level of false alarms .",
    "the latter is particularly the case if the candidate frequency is expected to vary between survey detection and reobservation , necessitating a large number of frequency channels to be searched during the reobservations .",

    "these situations can also be analyzed using the methods of this paper .    in applying our methods to existing surveys",

    "if any of the events in meta is a due to a scintillating celestial source , it likely results from a modest to large scintillation gain _ combined _ with a favorable noise fluctuation .",
    "* we also show that existing reobservations of meta candidate signals ( i.e. , those performed to date ) are incapable of ruling out the case where a real eti source with constant , intrinsic signal strength underlies the measured candidate signal .",
    "this conclusion holds even for the case where the scintillations remain correlated between the time of an initial detection and prompt reobservations .",
    "future reobservations are certainly capable of ruling out a constant - source model for meta detections . *",
    "a stronger test of our signal models and of the celestial nature of candidate signals requires much lower thresholds and a larger number of reobservations than have been performed to date . for meta , a reobservation threshold of 510 ( in signal - to - noise ratio ) rather than the actual 20",
    "is needed .",
    "the number of reobservations needed is a function of threshold but is many thousands for the threshold used . in future surveys , correlated reobservations made promptly after the initial survey detection can drastically lower the total number of reobservations needed to rule out constant - strength eti signal hypotheses . *",
    "dual - site observations made simultaneously are unlikely to yield dual detections of a source unless `` low '' thresholds are used for recording signal levels .",
    "having developed these formalisms and applied them to existing surveys , we also present recommendations for planning future surveys .",
    "an important recommendation concerns the philosophy regarding events below threshold . in horowitz & sagan  ( 1993 ) ,",
    "nearly all events below threshold were discarded . as a result , in this paper , we have treated all such events equally , since the only information reported was that the intensity was below threshold . in doing so",
    ", we have nevertheless illustrated that , with the appropriate combination of scintillations and noise , observed intensities of , say , @xmath137 can be explained by scintillating sources . if such scintillating sources do exist , then there must be many occasions in which the intensity would have been below threshold .",
    "we recommend the following strategies , based upon the methods described in zepka , cordes , & wasserman  ( 1994 ) , for establishing the existence of and recovering these signals :    * a minimalist strategy would retain only those events exceeding a threshold ( defined by the usual false - alarm probability ) , but would form a histogram of those events below threshold .",
    "since the expected distribution of the noise is known , viz .",
    "a one - sided exponential , then _ deviations _ from this histogram indicate the presence of non - noise signals . of course",
    ", separating rfi from actual eti signals still remains a problem , requiring new observations .",
    "* the optimal strategy would retain individual intensity values even for those that are far below the false - alarm threshold .",
    "clustering on the sky of results from multiple scans of the sky would suggest the locations of extraterrestrial sources that could be subjected to intense scrutiny by the flotilla of existing astronomical instrumentation .",
    "application of our low - threshold strategy requires archiving of spectral amplitudes at large data rates .",
    "our suggestion is that , given the large expense for conducting seti , the data recorded and archived should be of commensurate cost and at a volume dictated by hardware available in the current market .",

    "<S> we use scattering theory , simulations , and empirical constraints on interstellar scintillations to discuss the intermittency of radio signals from extraterrestrial intelligence ( eti ) . </S>",
    "<S> the number of eti sources in the galaxy has a direct influence on the expected dynamic range of fluxes in a survey , through inverse square - law effects and , equally importantly , by the number of independent statistical trials made on modulations caused by interstellar scintillations . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that scintillations are very likely to allow initial detections of narrowband signals , while making redetections extremely improbable , a result that follows from the skewed , exponential distribution of the modulation . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion holds for relatively distant sources but does not apply to radio seti toward nearby stars ( @xmath0 pc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> recent seti has found non - repeating , narrowband events that are largely unexplained . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three models in order to assess these events and to analyze large surveys in general : ( i ) radiometer noise fluctuations ; ( ii ) a population of constant galactic sources which undergo deep fading and amplification due to interstellar scintillation , consistent with eti transmissions ; and ( iii ) real , transient signals ( or hardware errors ) of either terrestrial or extraterrestrial origin .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive likelihood and bayesian tests of the models for individual events and globally on entire surveys . applying them to the planetary society / harvard meta data </S>",
    "<S> , we find that models  ii and iii are both highly preferred to model  i , but that models  ii and iii are about equally likely . in the context of model  ii , the likelihood analysis indicates that candidate events above threshold ( @xmath1 ) are _ combinations _ of large amplitude noise fluctuations and scintillation gains , making it highly probable that events seen once will only very rarely be seen again . </S>",
    "<S> ruling out model  ii in favor of model  iii is difficult  to do so , many more reobservations ( e.g. , thousands ) are needed than were conducted in meta ( hundreds ) _ or _ the reobservation threshold must be much lower than was used in meta . _ </S>",
    "<S> we can not , therefore , rule out the possibility that meta events are real , intrinsically steady eti signals . </S>",
    "<S> _    our formalism can be used to analyze any seti program . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the number of reobservations required to rule out model  ii in favor of model  iii , taking into account that reobservations made promptly sample the same scintillation gain as in the original detection , while delayed reobservations sample a decorrelated scintillation modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the required number is a strong function of the thresholds used in the original survey and in reobservations .    </S>",
    "<S> we assess optimal methods for applying statistical tests in future seti programs that use multiple site and multiple beam observations as well as single site observations . </S>",
    "<S> we recommend that results be recorded on many more events than have been made to date . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we suggest that surveys use thresholds that are far below the false - alarm threshold that is usually set to yield a small number of noise - induced `` detections '' in a massive survey . instead , </S>",
    "<S> large numbers of events should be recorded in order to ( 1 ) demonstrate that background noise conforms to the distribution expected for it ; and ( 2 ) investigate departures from the expected noise distribution as due to interference or to celestial signals . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , celestial signals can be investigated at levels much smaller than the false - alarm threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold level for archiving candidate intensities and their corresponding sky positions is best defined in terms of the recording and computational technology that is available at a cost commensurate with other survey costs . </S>"
