    "the relevance of the concepts and techniques of statistical physics to understanding the typical behavior of classes of optimization or decision problems had been pointed out by many authors already in the middle of the 1980s ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , it was only about ten years later , owing mainly to the finding of a ubiquitous peak in computational cost signaling a transition between easy and difficult instances of optimization problems , that the physics approach has succeeded to attract the attention of the computer science community ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , instances in the phase transition region",
    "are now routinely used to benchmark algorithms and search heuristics , and so a precise location of the critical point in addition to the estimate of the width of the transition region has gained considerable practical importance .",
    "the specific optimization problem we consider here is the number partitioning problem ( npp ) , which is one of the basic np - complete problems that form the core of the theory of np - completeness @xcite .",
    "npp has an easy formulation : given @xmath1 not necessarily distinct positive numbers @xmath2 , ",
    ", @xmath3 find a subset @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is minimized .",
    "we remark that npp can be regarded as a mattis - like ising spin model with hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 if @xmath8 and @xmath9 if @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider @xmath11 as an energy ( cost ) landscape over the hypercube ; in other words , single spin flips are a natural way of defining a neighborhood relation for the npp . for concreteness , we will assume from here on that the @xmath12s are independent , identically distributed random variables that take on integer values between @xmath13 and @xmath14 with equal probability .",
    "a partition @xmath15 is _ perfect _ if @xmath16 or @xmath13 for @xmath17 even or odd , respectively .",
    "the existence of perfect partitions depends on the accuracy to which the numbers @xmath12 are determined as well as on the size of the problem @xmath1 .",
    "the crucial control parameter here is the ratio between the number of bits to which @xmath18 is specified and the problem size @xmath19 the relevance of @xmath20 can be appreciated by considering the annealed estimate of the expected number of perfect partitions , @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "hence the annealed theory indicates that for @xmath23 there is an asymptotically exponential number of perfect partitions , while for @xmath24 the probability of finding a perfect partition is exponentially small .",
    "extensive numerical simulations and statistical mechanics calculations corroborate the value @xmath25 as the threshold separating the easy - to - solve from the hard - to - solve regimes @xcite .",
    "probabilistic and statistical mechanics analyses of the ground states of the hamiltonian ( [ eq_mattis ] ) in the limit of infinite precision @xmath26 , in which the @xmath12s can be viewed as continuous variables , have of course failed to detect the phase transition ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the thermodynamics for general @xmath14 was ` solved ' under the assumption of self - averaging of the random variables @xmath12 , but that solution is not completely satisfactory since it predicts a negative entropy for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "thus a reliable theory for the ground states of the npp , probably based on the replica method , has yet to be obtained .",
    "generally , the aforementioned phase transition is defined as a transition from a region in the space of control parameters in which almost all instances have many solutions to a region in which almost all instances have no solution @xcite .",
    "hence , the investigations have relied mainly on exhaustive search procedures , such as branch - and - bound algorithms , that guarantee the finding of the global optima , or on statistical mechanics calculations of the expected properties , such as the entropy , of the ground states . in this contribution",
    "we seek evidence of this easy / hard transition in the structure of the cost landscape of the optimization problem , focusing on the distribution of optima and on the distribution of cost barriers between these optima . to this end , we code the information about the paths of minimal cost leading to different optima in a tree structure , termed the _ barrier tree _ of the cost landscape .",
    "the leaves of this tree represent the local optima and the internal nodes the lowest - cost saddles connecting those optima .",
    "barrier trees have been widely used to study protein @xcite , rna @xcite , and spin - glass @xcite landscapes .",
    "we find that the structure of the landscape , as measured by the local minima and their connecting saddle points , shows surprisingly little difference in the easy and hard regimes .",
    "the sharp transition between these two regimes is revealed only by the _ difficulty _ of the landscape , a parameter measuring the maximum ratio of energy barrier to energy gain for the escape from a metastable state , which is directly related to the optimal speed of convergence of simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "we stress that our goal here is not to locate the transition point , which can be achieved by simply looking at the value of the global energy minimum in an ensemble of randomly generated instances ( in this sense , a barrier tree always contains the information on whether the given instance is easy or hard ) , but to seek evidences of the easy and hard regime on other global statistical properties of the energy landscape .",
    "furthermore , we examine a remarkable conjecture about the equivalence between the infinite accuracy version of the npp and the random cost problem @xcite , and show that , despite the equivalence at the level of the energy distributions , their barrier trees are completely different .",
    "the energy of the lowest saddle point separating two local minima @xmath28 and @xmath29 is @xmath30 = \\min _ { \\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathbb{p}_{xy } } \\ ,             \\max _ { z \\in \\mathbf{p } } e(z ) \\label{eq : saddle}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the set of all paths @xmath32 connecting @xmath28 and @xmath29 by a series of subsequent spin - flips @xcite .",
    "the _ barrier height _",
    "@xmath33 of a metastable state @xmath28 is the minimum height of a saddle point that connects it with metastable state @xmath29 with strictly smaller energy @xmath34 . in symbols , @xmath35 - e(x )",
    "\\big| ~y : e(y)<e(x ) \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{eq : defdepthc}\\ ] ] since a direct evaluation of eq.([eq : saddle ] ) would require the explicit constructions of all possible paths it does not provide a feasible algorithm for determining @xmath36 $ ] even if @xmath1 is small enough to allow an exhaustive survey of the landscape .",
    "the values of @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath33 can , however , be retrieved from the _ barrier tree _ of the landscape .",
    "the algorithm for constructing these barrier trees is presented in @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed account of the algorithm in the spin - glass context ) .",
    "it is implemented in the ` barriers ` program , which constructs the tree from a sorted list of energy values of all spin configurations in the landscape . in a barrier tree ,",
    "the leaves of the tree represent the local minima , and the internal nodes represent the saddles , with the barrier sizes given by the length of the branches connecting the local minima to their corresponding saddles .",
    "[ fig : trr_diff ] illustrates typical barrier trees for the problems considered in this paper .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a simple annealed - like argument to explain the behavior of the difficulty depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff ] goes as follows . in the easy regime",
    "we have more partitions ( spin configurations ) than different combinations of numbers , thus the global optimum will probably be a perfect partition , i.e. , @xmath37 or @xmath13 , while the lowest metastable state will have @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the height of the barrier separating them , however , is essentially the energy of a random configuration , i.e. , @xmath40 , and the maximum barrier height will be among the largest numbers in the system , i.e. , @xmath41 . hence subtracting @xmath1 from both sides yields @xmath42 in the easy regime . in the hard regime we can only hope to cancel the leading @xmath1 bits in the optimal configuration , thus we expect a ground - state energy @xmath43 , while the maximum barrier height is again @xmath44 yielding @xmath45 , which is then independent of @xmath20 .",
    "of course , these crude estimates miss polynomial corrections such as the factor @xmath46 that appears in the rigorous computation of the ground - state energy @xcite .",
    "note , however , that we are considering @xmath47 , i.e. , we ignore only logarithmic corrections which we would expect to arise for more careful estimates of @xmath48 as well . as the values of @xmath49 vary",
    "significantly among different landscapes with the same values of @xmath14 and @xmath1 it is not possible to obtain sufficiently accurate estimates of @xmath50 that would reveal such corrections unambiguously .",
    "since a barrier tree embodies all the relevant quantitative information about the multi - valley structure of an energy landscape , it seems natural to ask if there is any trace of the easy / hard phase transition in the shape of the barrier trees of the npp landscapes .    before introducing the standard measures of tree shapes we will consider the effect of the accuracy @xmath14 on probably the main characteristic of a tree , namely , its number of leaves or minima @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , it is tempting to associate the difficulty of a problem with the number of local minima ( traps ) in its energy landscape representation . surprisingly , however , we find that the average fraction of local minima does not change with @xmath14 as soon as @xmath52 , i.e. , as soon as it becomes unlikely that adjacent configurations have the same energy , see fig .",
    "[ fig : locmina ] . for very small values of @xmath14",
    "the number of local optima depends strongly on how degenerate neighbors are treated ( data not shown ) .",
    "the important point here is that the fraction of minima stays constant across the easy / hard transition and , in particular , it is given by the formula @xmath53 which was obtained in the limit of infinite accuracy @xcite .",
    "now we consider five measures of tree shape that were originally used to study phylogenetic trees ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) for the barrier trees resulting from npp landscapes .",
    "these measures provide statistical information about the shape of the barrier tree , mainly its symmetry or balance , and ignore the branch lengths , i.e. , the height of the barriers between minima , which were the object of the depth and difficult measures .",
    "recently , we showed that these measures are capable of distinguishing between @xmath0-spin models with different values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath54 be the graph - theoretical distance between two nodes of the tree , i.e. , the number of edges along the path that connects them .",
    "furthermore , we denote the root of the tree by @xmath55 .",
    "height _ of a leaf @xmath56 is @xmath57 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath58 is the number of internal nodes between leaf @xmath56 and the root @xmath55 ( inclusive ) . for each interior node @xmath59",
    "we have two subtrees with @xmath60 and @xmath61 leaves , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath62 .",
    "the _ subtree - height _ of an interior node @xmath59 is @xmath63 where the maximum is taken over all leaves @xmath56 in the subtree @xmath64 below @xmath59 , i.e. , the subtree of which @xmath59 is the root .    with this notation",
    "we may define the following five characteristic values for the shape of a binary rooted tree :    1 .",
    "@xmath65 is the _ average height _ of a leaf in the tree .",
    "@xmath66 , is the standard deviation of the leaf height .",
    "3 .   @xmath67 is a measure for the _ imbalance _ of trees with @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is the average inverse subtree height , where the sum is taken over all @xmath70 internal nodes @xmath59 excluding the root @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath71 is an alternatively weighted average leaf - height .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is clear .",
    "we mention only that for random trees ( e.g. , trees produced by the neutral genealogical process @xcite ) the expected value of @xmath72 increases as @xmath74 . in addition , @xmath75 for a completely symmetric tree .",
    "the imbalance measure @xmath76 assigns a weight proportional to the the number of leaves to each one of the two subtrees branching out an internal node .",
    "these weight differences are then averaged and normalized over all internal nodes of the tree . the value of @xmath76 increases from 0 for a completely symmetric tree to 1 for a completely asymmetric tree",
    "the statistic @xmath77 looks at the longest possible path @xmath78 from each internal node @xmath59 to any of the leaves in its subtree .",
    "the statistic @xmath79 is based on an index of information content . for highly asymmetric trees , such as those produced by @xmath0-spin landscapes @xcite",
    ", it will quickly converge to the value @xmath80 .",
    "both @xmath77 and @xmath79 have smaller values for increasingly asymmetric trees .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , neither of these measures exhibits a non - trivial dependence on @xmath20 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : treeshape ] for the measures @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath79 .",
    "the other quantities @xmath72 and @xmath73 behave analogously but have a larger scatter for large @xmath1 .",
    "therefore it is impossible to tell the easy from the hard regime by visual inspection of the barrier tree or by simply measuring branch lengths , as done in the depth measure .",
    "the only effective measure involves a nontrivial balance between branch lengths and leaf energies .",
    "a very interesting though poorly explored finding concerns the equivalence between the npp in the limit of infinite precision , where the @xmath12 become real random variables distributed uniformly in the unit interval , and the symmetrized truncated random energy model ( rem ) or random cost problem @xcite . in particular , for large problem sizes the energies of two or more distinct configurations of the npp become statistically independent and the @xmath81 distinct energies values for unconstrained partitions are distributed according to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the second moment of the @xmath18 in the corresponding number partitioning problem .",
    "hence the bold claim that the npp is essentially equivalent to a truncated rem @xcite .",
    "the main application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trem ] ) is the derivation of the probability density of the minimum energy @xmath84 using trite arguments of extreme statistics @xcite , @xmath85 , \\ ] ] from which the expected minimum energy follows trivially , @xmath86 in agreement with the known numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite results for the npp .",
    "however , in order for the equivalence at the level of the energy distribution between the npp and the truncated rem to have any use in guiding the design of search heuristics for the npp , it is important that other features of the two problems , such as their multi - valley structures , are similar too .",
    "in fact , a glance at fig . [",
    "fig : trr_diff ] is already sufficient to reveal the deep structural difference between the barrier trees of these problems , and the remainder of this section is aimed at quantifying these differences .",
    "the expected number of minima can be easily calculated for any random energy model with finite probability density over the reals @xcite .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "fix an arbitrary spin configuration @xmath87 and consider all its n neighbors . since we assign to each spin configuration a random energy value drawn from the continuous distribution ( [ eq : trem ] )",
    "we conclude that ( i ) all these @xmath88 energies are distinct with probability 1 ; and ( ii ) @xmath89 is the smallest of the n+1 numbers with a probability of @xmath90 . hence @xmath91 is a local minimum with probability @xmath90 and so the fraction of local minima is @xmath92 which , for large @xmath1 , is larger than the result for the npp [ see eq.([eq : npp_min ] ) ] by a factor of order of @xmath46 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : new ] we present the tree size ( @xmath51 ) dependence of the barrier tree measures @xmath76 and @xmath72 for the npp and the symmetrized truncated rem .",
    "a useful standard here , also shown in this figure , is the random trees , generated as follows .",
    "first , create @xmath51 nodes ( the leaves ) and put them in a set @xmath93 .",
    "next , remove two random nodes @xmath28 and @xmath29 from @xmath93 , create a new node @xmath94 and make @xmath28 and @xmath29 its two children , and put @xmath94 in the set @xmath93 .",
    "repeat this procedure until there is only one node left in @xmath93 , which will be the root of the tree .",
    "random trees are important from the biological viewpoint because they arise from the neutral genealogical process @xcite .",
    "the symmetrized truncated rem presents the same scaling on @xmath51 as the @xmath0-spin models , namely , @xmath95 and @xmath96 within the range of @xmath51 considered @xcite . of course ,",
    "since @xmath97 $ ] this scaling can not be valid for @xmath98 , but the double logarithmic dependence guarantees its validity for a very large range of tree sizes . actually , as far as the five statistics introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : shapes ] are concerned , there is no significative differences between the symmetrized truncated rem and the standard rem , both models producing then extremely unbalanced trees .",
    "these measures , however , differ dramatically between the npp and all previous spin - glass models analysed @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the npp barrier trees are practically indistinguishable from random trees and , in particular , the tree measures obey the same scaling relation with the tree size , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . hence these trees , in stark contrast with the @xmath0-spin model and rem barrier trees , become more and more balanced as @xmath51 increases .    since the equivalence between npp and the truncated rem discussed above was proved only in the case of infinite precision numbers ( i.e. , @xmath101 ) it provides no clues about the easy / hard phase transition that takes place at @xmath102 .",
    "nevertheless , it is natural to ask if the integer counterpart of the truncated rem , obtained by considering the integer - valued energies @xmath103 where @xmath11 is drawn from the distribution ( [ eq : trem ] ) with @xmath104 replaced by @xmath105 , exhibits a phase transition .",
    "this can easily be answered by calculating the probability that a partition is perfect ( i.e. , @xmath106 or @xmath13 ) which is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "although one clearly recovers the easy ( @xmath109 ) and the hard ( @xmath110 ) regimes depending on whether the ratio @xmath111 is very small or very large , respectively , there is definitely no phase transition separating them .",
    "phase transitions in physical systems are characterized by the appearance of singularities in some observables , known as the order parameters of the system , such as , e.g. , the gas density in the boiling transition . in the case of mean - field spin - glass models",
    "the order parameter directly reflects the hierarchical organization of pure states in a complex multi - valley structure @xcite .",
    "therefore one expects that some features of that structure must undergo abrupt changes when the critical point is approached .",
    "unfortunately , the vast majority of the phase transitions take place at finite temperature , while a direct study of the landscape properties of spin - glass models based on natural quantities , such as saddle points and minima , is feasible at zero temperature only . in that sense ,",
    "the easy / hard phase transitions in optimization problems @xcite in general , and in the number partitioning problem ( npp ) @xcite considered here , provide a unique chance to study how the onset of the phase transition affects the organization of the metastable states of a disordered spin system .    somewhat surprisingly , we find that almost all features of the landscape , which we have properly mapped into a tree structure through the barriers program , are insensitive to the onset of the easy / hard phase transition that takes place when the number of bits needed to specify a number @xmath12 equals the problem size , i.e. , @xmath112 .",
    "interestingly , only one of the measures studied , premonitorily termed _ difficulty _ in the mathematical literature of simulated annealing @xcite , exhibits a singular behavior at the critical point . as a result ,",
    "the quality of the optima found by simulated annealing will probably depend strongly on whether the control parameters set the instance in the easy ( @xmath113 ) or hard ( @xmath114 ) regime .",
    "an important by - product of our study of the npp landscape is the finding that the resulting barrier trees are very similar to random trees , and so they become completely balanced ( symmetric ) in the limit of large system sizes @xmath1 or , equivalently , large tree sizes @xmath51 .",
    "these trees contrast drastically with the barriers trees resulting from the @xmath0 spin - glass , the random energy or the symmetrized truncated random energy landscapes , which become completely unbalanced in that limit . in this context",
    ", we note that although there is an equivalence at the level of the energy distribution between the npp and the truncated random energy model , the statistical properties of their energy landscapes are very different , and probably so are the performances of local search heuristics in finding near - global solutions to these problems .",
    "actually , the similarity of the npp barrier trees with random trees may be part of the explanation for the failure of local search techniques to produce good solutions to this optimization problem .",
