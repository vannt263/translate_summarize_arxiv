    "the study of the production of charmed hadrons in antiproton - proton ( @xmath7 ) collisions is of importance for the understanding of the strong force in the nonperturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the fair project at the gsi laboratory has an extensive program aiming at a high - accuracy spectroscopy of charmed hadrons and at an investigation of their interactions with ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "presently little is known about such interactions and their knowledge is a prerequisite for investigating issues like in - medium properties of charmed hadrons , e.g. @xmath8-quarkonium dissociation and changes in properties of @xmath9 mesons due to chiral symmetry restoration effects on the light quarks composing these mesons .",
    "therefore there is an urgent need for theoretical investigations to guide such experiments .    in the present paper we concentrate on the reaction @xmath10 close to its threshold .",
    "providing predictions or simply estimations for this reaction is very challenging .",
    "first of all , the lack of any direct empirical information on this reaction makes it difficult to constrain model parameters .",
    "second , both long - distance and short - distance physics are present in the reaction and this poses the question on the appropriate degrees of freedom to be used in order to describe it , quarks and gluons or mesons and baryons , or a combination of both . to the best of our knowledge , presently there are only four elaborate studies that consider this reaction .",
    "the most recent publication is by goritschnig et al .",
    "@xcite , who employ a quark - gluon description based on a factorization hypothesis of hard and soft processes .",
    "this work supersedes an earlier study by that group within a quark - diquark picture , where already concrete predictions for the @xmath2 production cross section were given  @xcite . in the study by kaidalov and volkovitsky  @xcite",
    "a non - perturbative quark - gluon string model is used , based on secondary regge pole exchanges including absorptive corrections . on the same lines , there is the more recent publication by titov and kmpfer  @xcite .",
    "our work here builds on the jlich meson - baryon model  @xcite for the reaction @xmath11 . in that model",
    "the hyperon - production reaction is considered within a coupled - channel approach in which the microscopic strangeness production process and the elastic parts of the interactions in the initial ( @xmath7 ) and final ( @xmath4 ) states are described by meson exchanges , while annihilation processes are accounted for by phenomenological optical potentials .",
    "the elastic parts of the initial- and final - state interactions ( isi and fsi ) are @xmath12-parity transforms of an one - boson - exchange variant of the bonn @xmath13 potential  @xcite and of the hyperon - nucleon model  a of ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the model achieved a reasonably good overall description of the wealth of @xmath1 data collected by the p185 collaboration at lear ( cern ) on total and differential cross - sections and spin observables @xcite  see also the review in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the extension of the model to the charm sector here follows a strategy similar to our recent work on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 interactions  @xcite , which used the original jlich meson - exchange model for the @xmath16 system  @xcite and improvements from quark - gluon dynamics at short distances @xcite .",
    "specifically , in the present paper we construct an extension of the meson - exchange model of refs .",
    "@xcite to the reaction @xmath10 assuming as a working hypothesis su(4 ) symmetry constraints .",
    "we examine the sensitivity of the results to changes in the elastic and annihilation parts of the initial @xmath7 interaction and inspect the effects of the final @xmath2 interaction and of the form factors that enter in the @xmath10 transition potential described by @xmath17-channel @xmath9 and @xmath18 meson exchanges .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the effect of replacing this meson - exchange transition by a charm - production potential derived in a quark model .",
    "we believe this is important for assessing uncertainties in the model , since one could easily raise the question on the validity of a meson - exchange description of the transition in view of the large masses of the exchanged mesons .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the basic ingredients of the model and fix parameters by fitting differential and total inclusive @xmath7 cross sections . in section  [ sec : res ] we present numerical results for our predictions for differential and total cross sections and compare with the results available in the literature .",
    "a summary of our work is presented in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we will start discussing the basic ingredients of the original jlich coupled channel approach  @xcite that we employ here for the reaction @xmath10 .",
    "the transition amplitude is obtained from the solution of a coupled - channel lippmann - schwinger equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the initial energy and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) the c.m .",
    "( center - of - mass ) relative momentum in the initial ( final ) state .",
    "here @xmath23 is a @xmath24 matrix in channel space containing the interaction potentials ( channel @xmath25 , channel @xmath26 ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the propagator @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the diagonal potentials @xmath32 are given by the sum of an elastic part and an annihilation part .    though the jlich group has developed rather sophisticated models of the @xmath33 interaction @xcite these potentials can not be used anymore at such high energies .",
    "indeed , already in the study of @xmath1 the elastic part of the @xmath33 potential was deduced ( via g - parity transform ) from a simple , energy - independent one - boson - exchange @xmath13 potential ( obepf ) and a phenomenological spin- , isospin- , and energy - independent optical potential of gaussian form , v^|p p|p p_opt(r ) = ( u_0 + i w_0 ) e^- r^2/2r^2_0 , [ vaa - pp ] was added in order to take into account annihilation .",
    "now , at even much higher energies , any @xmath13 potential has to be considered as being purely phenomenological .",
    "still we keep the longest ranged ( and model - independent ) part of the elastic @xmath7 interaction , namely one - pion exchange . to it",
    "we add again an optical potential of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ vaa - pp ] ) and determine the parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , cf .",
    "table  [ param ] ) by a fit to @xmath33 data in the energy range relevant for the reaction @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , there are total cross sections @xcite and even differential cross sections @xcite around @xmath37 10 gev / c , i.e. fairly close to the @xmath2 threshold which is at 10.162 gev / c .",
    "this @xmath7 potential is called model a in the following . as can be seen from table  [ cross ] and fig .",
    "[ pbarp ] the integrated cross sections as well as the @xmath7 different cross section are fairly well reproduced .    since one knows from studies on @xmath1 that the magnitude of the cross sections depends very sensitively on the isi @xcite we consider here several variants of the @xmath33 potential .",
    "first , we take the full g - parity transformed obepf interaction and add again the optical potential ( model d ) . obviously in this case , only the total cross section can be still brought in line with the experiment by adjusting the parameters of the optical potential , while all other cross sections are strongly overestimated .",
    "still we consider this potential too with the intention that it serves as an illustration for the uncertainties in our predictions due to the used @xmath7 interaction .",
    "realizing that the overestimation of the cross sections is primarily caused by the vector - meson exchange ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) contributions @xcite to obepf , we prepare two more potentials where we ( i ) leave out those vector mesons altogether ( b ) or ( ii ) reduce the elastic part ( except for one - pion exchange ) to 10% ( c ) . within both scenarios a rather satisfying description of the @xmath33 data around 10 gev / c can be obtained , cf .",
    "table [ cross ] and fig .  [ pbarp ] .",
    "in particular , not only the slope but even the shoulder in the differential cross section is reproduced quantitatively by these two interactions .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the interaction in the final @xmath2 system is assumed to be the same as the one in @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , this means that the elastic part of the interaction is given by the isospin - zero @xmath40 and @xmath39 exchanges with coupling constants taken from the hyperon - nucleon model  a of ref .",
    "@xcite , while the annihilation part is again parameterized by an optical potential which contains , however , spin - orbit and tensor components in addition to a central component @xcite : v^|_c^- _ c^+|_c^- _ c^+_opt(r ) & = & e^- r^2/2r^2_0 .",
    "[ vaa - ll ] the free parameters in the optical @xmath4 potential were determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by a fit to data on total and differential cross sections , and analyzing power for @xmath1 . clearly , there are no reasons to believe that the @xmath2 interaction will be the same on a quantitative level .",
    "but we expect that at least the bulk properties are similar .",
    "specifically , in both cases near threshold the interactions will be govered by strong annihilation processes .",
    "we will investigate the role played by the fsi for our results by simply switching it off .",
    "we use the parameters as given in table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in principle",
    ", the parameters of @xmath41 can only be determined together with those for @xmath2 because we consider a coupled - channels problem . however , like in @xmath4 the branching ratio @xmath0 is so small that the effect of the @xmath2 channel on the diagonal @xmath7 @xmath42-matrix can be savely neglected .",
    "the transition potential from @xmath7 to @xmath2 is given by @xmath17-channel @xmath9 and @xmath18 exchanges and their explicit expressions are the same as for @xmath43 and @xmath44 as given in ref .",
    "they are of the generic form v^",
    "p|p |_c^- _ c^+ ( t ) ~_m = d , d^ * g^2_n_c m , [ vtrans ] where @xmath45 are coupling constants and @xmath46 are form factors . under the assumption of @xmath47 symmetry",
    "the coupling constants are the same as in the corresponding exchanges in @xmath1 .",
    "however , the cutoff masses in the vertex form factors can not be taken over , because the masses of the exchanged particles are now much larger .",
    "we use here a monopole form factor with a cutoff mass @xmath48 of 3 gev , at the @xmath49 as well as at the @xmath50 vertex but we will explore the sensitivity of the results to variations of the cutoff mass .    to examine further the uncertainties , as an alternative we consider here also a charm - production potential inspired by quark - gluon dynamics .",
    "there is a large literature associated with strange - hadron production in @xmath51 reactions , the best known works are those of kohno and weise  @xcite , furui and faessler  @xcite , burkardt and dillig  @xcite , roberts  @xcite and alberg , henley and wilets  @xcite  a more complete list of references can be found in the review of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present study",
    "we adopt the interaction proposed by kohno and weise , derived in the so - called @xmath52 mechanism of a constituent quark model . in this model",
    "the @xmath53 pair in the final state is created from an initial @xmath54 or @xmath55 pair via @xmath56-channel gluon exchange .",
    "after quark degrees - of - freedom are integrated out the potential has the form  @xcite : ^|p p| ( r ) = 4 _ s1_t0()^3/2 ( -3r^2/(4 ^ 2 ) )  .",
    "[ qm - pot ] here @xmath57 is an effective ( quark - gluon ) coupling strength , @xmath58 is the mean square radius associated with the quark distribution in the @xmath59 or @xmath48 , and @xmath60 and @xmath42 are the total spin and isospin in the @xmath7 system .",
    "this simple potential has actually a very modern form , namely that of a contact term , though smeared out by the quark distribution .",
    "the effective coupling strength is practically a free parameter that was fixed by a fit to the @xmath1 data @xcite .",
    "but it depends implicitly on the effective gluon propagator , i.e. on the square of the energy transfer from initial to final quark pair , cf",
    "heuristically this energy transfer corresponds roughly to the masses of the produced constituent quarks , i.e. @xmath61 , we expect the effective coupling strength @xmath57 for charm production to be reduced by the ratio of the constituent quark masses of the strange and the charmed quark squared , @xmath62 ( 550 mev / 1600 mev)@xmath6 @xmath63 1/9 as compared to the one for @xmath1",
    ". note that a different suppression factor arises for the @xmath64 quark - antiquark annihilation vertex , considered by alberg et al . in their study of @xmath1 @xcite . in this case",
    "the amplitude scales with @xmath65 so that the effective strength of the transition potential is reduced by @xmath66 1/3 only when going from strangeness to charm production .",
    "our predictions for the total reaction cross section for @xmath67 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the cross section is shown as a function of the excess energy @xmath68 so that we can compare it with the one for @xmath69 at the corresponding @xmath70 .",
    "the curve in fig .  [ fig:2 ] correspond to the @xmath7 model c , for which we obtained the largest results .    obviously , and as expected , the cross section for @xmath2 production is smaller than the one for @xmath4 .",
    "but the difference is about one order of magnitude only .",
    "indeed , one can get a very rough estimation for the reduction just by considering the following : when going from @xmath4 to @xmath2 within the meson - exchange picture the main change occurs in the meson propagators of the transition potentials where the masses of the strange mesons ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) are replaced by those of the charmed mesons ( @xmath9 , @xmath18 ) , @xmath71 , cf .",
    "( [ vtrans ] ) .",
    "all coupling constants remain the same because of the assumed su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "thus , the ratio of the transition potentials is then given roughly by @xmath72 so that one expects the cross section to be smaller by a factor of around 16 .",
    "our explicit calculation is pretty much in line with this admittedly rather qualitative estimation .",
    "let us now discuss the sensitivity of the results to the various ingredients of our model calculation .",
    "the most crucial component is certainly the @xmath7 interaction in the initial state . without it , and specifically in born approximation , we would get cross sections that are more than a factor 100 larger .",
    "this is no surprise because the very same gross overestimation in the born approximation occurs for @xmath1 @xcite but also for other exclusive @xmath7 annihilation channels like @xmath73 , @xmath74 , etc .",
    "@xcite , if one does not take into account the isi .",
    "however , with the isi included , it is reassuring to see that the variations of the predicted @xmath0 cross section for the different @xmath7 potentials we have prepared is fairly small . to be concrete , the cross sections at @xmath75 100 mev are 5.8 , 6.3 , and 7.3 @xmath3 for the interactions a , b , and c , respectively . only the result based on the full g - parity transformed obepf potential differs more significantly . here",
    "we get a cross section that is with 0.8 @xmath3 a factor 10 smaller than the other values .",
    "the suppression for this @xmath7 model is presumably due to the fact that it yields a @xmath7 elastic cross section that is much larger than the ones of the other potentials considered , and actually in disagreement with experimental information .",
    "still , the variation of one order of magnitude may be considered as a realistic estimation of the uncertainty due to the isi .",
    "once the isi is included our results turned out to be rather insensitive to the final @xmath2 interaction .",
    "even when we leave it out altogether the cross sections do not change ( decrease ) by more than 10 - 15 % .",
    "we also considered variations of the cutoff mass at the @xmath76 and @xmath77 vertices .",
    "for the results discussed above a value of @xmath78 3 gev has been used . when reducing this value to 2.5 gev the cross sections at @xmath75 100 mev drop by roughly a factor 3 . of course , employing even smaller cutoff masses would further decrease the cross sections . however , since the exchanged mesons have a mass of around 1.9 to 2 gev we consider values below 2.5 gev as being not really realistic .",
    "we display here also the results based on an adaption of the @xmath52 quark - gluon transition mechanism of ref .",
    "we scale the effective coupling strength @xmath79 , fixed in our study of @xmath1  @xcite , with @xmath80 using the constituent quark masses @xmath81 and @xmath82 , i.e. the same values as employed in our previous works in refs .  @xcite .",
    "as expected , we obtain cross sections that are of the same magnitude as those predicted in the meson - exchange picture though roughly a factor three smaller , cf . the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . in principle",
    "the factor @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ qm - pot ] ) also changes when replacing @xmath84 by @xmath85 , since it gives the size of the quark distribution of the overlapping hadrons ",
    "@xmath83 decreases as @xmath84 is replaced by @xmath85 .",
    "we have not changed this factor in the present work , since we expect this change to be much smaller than the change in the square of the energy transfer @xmath86 , since hadron sizes do not scale as simple powers of quark masses and so the overlap between hadron wave functions is not expected to change drastically from @xmath48 to @xmath87  for explicit numbers for the size parameters of harmonic oscillator wave functions for @xmath88 and @xmath87 see ref .",
    "the size parameter we use is @xmath89 .",
    "predictions for differential cross sections , the singlet fraction @xmath90 , the depolarization @xmath91 and the spin - correlation parameter @xmath92 ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for definitions ) at @xmath75 40 mev are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for all four isi considered .",
    "note that the singlet fraction is defined by @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "it is zero if the @xmath2 pair is produced purely in a triplet state . indeed in case of @xmath1 it was found experimentally that the singlet fraction is close to zero @xcite and this feature was reproduced by meson - exchange potentials @xcite as well as by transition interactions based on quark - gluon dynamics @xcite . in the former it is due to a strong tensor force generated by the combined @xmath94 exchange which leads to a dominance of transitions of the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 refers to the orbital angular momentum . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the very same feature is predicted also for the reaction @xmath0 . the differential cross section exhibits a peak in forward direction , similar to what has been also observed for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "let us now compare our predictions with those by other groups .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "goritschnig et al .",
    "@xcite as well as kaidalov and volkovitsky  @xcite have presented explicit results in their publications and we reproduce them in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] to facilitate a comparison .",
    "our results are shown as dark ( red ) shaded band ( and grid ) in order to reflect the variation of the predictions when the four different isi are used .",
    "it is remarkable that our results differ drastically from those of the preceeding works .",
    "specifically , our cross sections are a factor 1000 larger than those given by goritschnig et al . and they are still about 100 times larger than the ones by kaidalov and volkovitsky .",
    "thus , even when considering the variation of about a factor ten due to the isi that we see in our results and the uncertainties due to the unconstrained fsi and form factors in the transition potential that amount to roughly a factor three , we are faced with an impressive qualitative difference .",
    "in this paper we presented predictions for the charm - production reaction @xmath0 .",
    "the calculations were performed in the meson - exchange framework in close analogy to our earlier study on @xmath1 by connecting the two processes via su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "the interaction in the inital @xmath7 interaction , which plays a crucial role for the quantiative predictions and which is now needed at a much higher energy , is re - adjusted so that available @xmath7 scattering data in the relevant energy range are reproduced .",
    "the obtained @xmath2 production cross sections are in the order of 1 to 7 @xmath3 .",
    "thus , they are just about a factor 10 smaller than the corresponding cross sections for @xmath4 .",
    "the reduction is in line with a naive estimation based on the mass ratio of strange ( @xmath97 ) versus charmed ( @xmath98 ) mesons .",
    "the exchange of those mesons governs the range of the forces that are responsible for producing a @xmath48 or a @xmath87 , respectively , in the meson - exchange picture .",
    "interestingly , other model calculations in the literature predict @xmath2 production cross sections that are 100 to 1000 times smaller than what we found .",
    "since the approaches used in those calculations are rather different from ours it is practically impossible to say where this drastic difference in the predicted cross sections comes from .",
    "hence , a discrimination between those scenarios appears to be possible only when the reaction @xmath0 will be examined in a future experiment at fair . of course",
    ", if our predictions turn out to be closer to reality than the others , it will be much easier to perform a pertinent experiment at fair .",
    "moreover , @xmath87 s and @xmath99 s can then be produced more copiously so that also any other experiment that requires charmed baryons as a probe will be much more promising .",
    "the model presented here leaves room for improvements in several directions .",
    "in particular , it would be important to extend the simple picture of @xmath56-channel @xmath100 annihilation followed by @xmath101 creation for the transition amplitude in the quark model as used here .",
    "an interesting possibility is the one pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1 where interacting many - quark intermediate states are considered in the process .",
