    "various approaches of perturbative qcd including the next - to - leading order calculations ( nlo qcd ) have been applied to construct distributions of quarks in a proton .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the lepton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off protons and nuclei provides rather realistic information on the distribution of light quarks like @xmath2 in a proton . however , to find a reliable distribution of heavy quarks like @xmath3 and especially @xmath4 in a proton describing the experimental data on the dis is a non - trivial task .",
    "it is mainly due to small values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 meson yields in the dis at existing energies . even at the tevatron",
    "energies the @xmath6- meson yield is not so large . at lhc energies the multiplicity of these mesons produced in @xmath0 collisions will be significantly larger . therefore one can try to extract a new information on the distribution of these heavy quarks in a proton . in this paper",
    "we suggest to study the distribution of heavy quarks like @xmath7 and @xmath4 in a proton from the analysis of the future lhc experimental data .    the multiple hadron production in hadron - nucleon collisions at high energies and large transfers is usually analyzed within the hard parton scattering model ( hpsm ) suggested in @xcite .",
    "this model was applied to the charmed meson production both in proton - proton and meson - proton interactions at high energies , see for example @xcite .",
    "the hpsm is significantly improved by applying the qcd parton approach @xcite , see details in @xcite and references therein .",
    "unfortunately the qcd including the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) has some uncertainties related to the renormalization parameters especially at small transverse momenta @xmath8 @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we studied the charmed and beauty meson production in @xmath0 and @xmath9 collisions at high energies within the qgsm @xcite or the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite based on the @xmath10 expansion in qcd @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this approach can be applied rather successfully at not very large values of @xmath8 . in this paper",
    "we investigate the open charm and beauty baryon production in @xmath0 collisions at lhc energies and very small @xmath8 within the qgsm to find new information on the regge trajectories of the heavy ( @xmath11 ) and ( @xmath1 ) mesons and the sea beauty quark distributions in the proton .",
    "let us present briefly the scheme of the analysis of the hadron production in the @xmath0 collisions within the qgsm including the transverse motion of quarks and diquarks in colliding protons @xcite .",
    "as is known , the cylinder type graphs for the @xmath0 collision presented in fig.1 make the main contribution to this process @xcite .",
    "the left diagram of fig.1 , the so - called one - cylinder graph , corresponds to the case where two colorless strings are formed between the quark / diquark ( @xmath12 ) and the diquark / quark ( @xmath13 ) in colliding protons ; then , after their breakup , @xmath14 pairs are created and fragmentated to a hadron , for example , @xmath5 meson .",
    "the right diagram of fig.1 , the so - called multicylinder graph , corresponds to creation of the same two colorless strings and many strings between sea quarks / antiquarks @xmath15 and sea antiquarks / quarks @xmath16 in the colliding protons .     process . ]",
    "the general form for the invariant inclusive hadron spectrum within the qgsm is @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the energy and the three - momentum of the produced hadron @xmath19 in the laboratory system ( l.s . ) of colliding protons ; @xmath20 are the energy of @xmath19 and the square of the initial energy in the c.m.s of @xmath0 ; @xmath21 are the feynman variable and the transverse momentum of @xmath19 ; @xmath22 is the cross section for production of the @xmath23-pomeron chain ( or @xmath24 quark - antiquark strings ) decaying into hadrons , calculated within the `` eikonal approximation '' @xcite . actually , the function @xmath25 is the convolution of the quark ( diquark ) distributions in the proton and their fragmentation functions ( ff ) , see details in @xcite . to calculate the interaction function",
    "@xmath25 we have to know all the quark ( diquak ) distribution functions in the nth pomeron chain and the ff .",
    "they are constructed within the qgsm using the knowledge of the secondary regge trajectories , see details in @xcite .",
    "now let us analyze the charmed and beauty baryon production in the @xmath0 collision at lhc energies and very small @xmath8 within the soft qcd , e.g. , the qgsm .",
    "this study can be interesting for it may allow predictions for future lhc experiments like totem and atlas and an opportunity to find new information on the distribution of sea charmed ( @xmath26 ) and beauty ( @xmath27 ) quarks at very low @xmath28 . according to the qgsm , the distribution of @xmath3 quarks in the @xmath23th pomeron chain ( fig.1(right ) )",
    "is , see for example @xcite and references therein , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is the weight of charmed pairs in the quark sea , @xmath33 is the normalization coefficient @xcite , @xmath34 is the intercept of the @xmath35- regge trajectory .",
    "its value can be @xmath36 assuming that this trajectory @xmath37 is linear and the intercept and the slope @xmath38 can be determined by drawing the trajectory through the @xmath39-meson mass @xmath40 gev and the @xmath41-meson mass @xmath42 gev @xcite .",
    "assuming that the @xmath35- regge trajectory is nonlinear one can get @xmath43 , which follows from perturbative qcd , as it was shown in @xcite . the distribution of @xmath4 quarks in the @xmath23th pomeron chain ( fig.1(right ) ) has the similar form @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the well known intercept of the @xmath48-trajectory ; @xmath49 is the intercept of the baryon trajectory , @xmath50 is the intercept of the @xmath51- regge trajectory , its value also has an uncertainty . assuming its linearity one can get @xmath52 , while for nonlinear ( @xmath1 ) regge trajectory @xmath53 , see details in @xcite . inserting these values to the form for @xmath54 and @xmath55 we get the large sensitivity for the @xmath26 and @xmath27 sea quark distributions in the @xmath23th pomeron chain .",
    "note that the ffs also depend on the parameters of these regge trajectories .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the intercepts and slopes of the heavy - meson regge trajectories is very important for the theoretical analysis of open charm and beauty production in hadron processes .",
    "note that all the quark distributions obtained within the qgsm are different from the parton distributions obtained within the perturbative qcd which are usually compared with the experimental data on the deep inelastic lepton scattering ( dis ) off protons . to match these two kinds of quark distributions",
    "one can apply the procedure suggested in @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath56 or @xmath57 entering into eq.([def : fc ] ) and eq.([def : fb ] ) are replaced by the following new quantities depending on @xmath28 @xmath58 the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath59 are chosen such that the structure function constructed from the valence and sea quark ( antiquark ) distributions in the proton should be the same as the one at the initial conditions at @xmath60 for the perturbative qcd evolution.a similar procedure can be used to get the @xmath28 dependence for the powers @xmath61 and @xmath62 entering into eqs.([def : fc],[def : fb ] ) @xcite . then using the dglap evolution equation @xcite we obtain the structure functions at large @xmath28 .",
    "the information on the charmonium ( @xmath11 ) and botomonium ( @xmath1 ) regge trajectories can be found from the experimental data on the charmed and beauty baryon production in @xmath0 collisions at high energies .",
    "for example , fig.2 illustrates the sensitivity of the inclusive spectrum @xmath63 of the produced charmed baryons @xmath64 to different values for @xmath34 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to @xmath65 , whereas the dashed curve corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "unfortunately the experimental data presented in fig.2 have big uncertainties ; therefore , one ca nt extract the information on the @xmath34 values from the existing experimental data .",
    "a high sensitivity of the inclusive spectrum @xmath63 of the produced beauty baryons @xmath67 to different values for @xmath68 is presented in fig.3 ( left ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig.5 the distributions over @xmath69 ( left ) and @xmath70 ( right ) are presented at different values of the intercept @xmath71 ( solid line ) , @xmath72 ( dashed line ) and @xmath73 ( dotted line ) , where @xmath69 is the scattering angle for the final @xmath39 .",
    "fig.5 shows a sensitivity of these distributions to the intercept of the @xmath74 regge trajectory .",
    "actually , the result presented in fig.5 is a prediction for future lhc experiments on the heavy flavour baryon production at the lhc energies .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the modified qgsm including the intrinsic longitudinal and transverse motion of quarks ( antiquarks ) and diquarks in colliding protons allowed us to describe rather satisfactorily the existing experimental data on inclusive spectra of heavy hadrons produced in @xmath0 and @xmath9 collisions it allows us to make some predictions for future lhc forward experiments on the beauty baryon production in @xmath0 collisions which can give us new information on the beauty quark distribution in the proton and very interesting information on the regge trajectories of ( @xmath1 ) mesons .",
