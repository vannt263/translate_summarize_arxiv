    "wide - field studies of massive galaxies provide important benchmarks for comparisons with globular cluster ( gc ) formation and evolution models as well as gc system assembly in the context of galaxy formation scenarios , not only because they define homogeneous and uniform datasets but also due to their simultaneous sampling of galaxy core and halo regions where various different physical processes affect the gc formation and survivability .  in general",

    "the launch of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) catapulted this field to a whole new stratum , making vast numbers of gc systems accessible to high spatial resolution studies @xcite .",
    "in fact , hst still provides our only access to high spatial resolution observations at optical wavelengths .",
    "several pioneering hst works quickly reached out with their gc half - light radius measurements beyond the lg as far as the fornax galaxy cluster at @xmath9 mpc distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "numerous subsequent studies have used the superior spatial resolution of hst and the relatively large field of view ( @xmath10 ) of the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) to collect large imaging datasets of extragalactic gc systems , the most homogeneous of which was obtained by the acs virgo and fornax cluster surveys ( acsvcs and acsfcs , see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "these observations set the baseline for systematic studies of gc structural parameters in the central regions of early - type cluster galaxies .  there was quickly mounting consensus among the early hst investigations that the observed central gcs had a rather broad half - light radius distribution with a peak somewhere in the range @xmath11 pc , which led to the suggestion that this peak value may be used as a geometric distance indicator ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another important finding was that the blue gcs are on average larger than the red gcs .",
    "in particular , within the central regions of galaxies typically observed with hst , blue gcs show @xmath12 larger mean half - light radii compared to the red gc sub - population ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the composite gc system of the six giant ellipticals studied by @xcite exhibits a mild relation of the form @xmath27 and a @xmath23 size difference between red and blue gcs that is independent of projected galactocentric radius .      in general , the finding of a size difference between blue and red gcs has important astrophysical implications for the understanding of the formation and evolution of gcs and for the usefulness of the peak value of the gc size distribution as geometric distance indicator .",
    "several studies , such as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite put forward models to explain the size difference between blue and red gcs .",
    "inspired by the milky way gc system where a shallow relation exists between gc half - light radius and the 3-dimensional galactocentric distance , @xmath28 @xcite , @xcite suggested that the gc size difference between red and blue gcs in massive ellipticals could be due to the difference in their spatial distribution functions .",
    "typically , the red gc sub - population would be more centrally concentrated than their blue counterpart and therefore on average smaller , being tidally more truncated by the stronger host galaxy potential .",
    "however , @xcite have shown in detailed numerical simulations that the observed gc size difference is unlikely due to projection effects alone .",
    "in contrast to this _ external effect _ , two alternative _ internal effects _ were put forward .",
    "firstly , @xcite suggested that the combined effect of mass segregation and shorter stellar lifetimes of more metal - rich stars at a given mass may explain the gc size difference .",
    "this was strictly valid under the assumption that the gc _ half - mass _ radius distribution would be independent of metallicity and that metal - poor and metal - rich gcs were of the same age , which may be at odds with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario was further developed by @xcite and @xcite in direct - integration n - body simulations of young , low - mass clusters with and without initial mass segregation , the absence of which was found to be enhancing the gc size difference .  @xcite performed monte - carlo n - body simulations of massive star clusters and found that significant numbers of massive stellar remnants , i.e.  single and binary black holes would boost this gc size difference .",
    "secondly , @xcite suggested that more metal - rich proto - gc clouds could cool more efficiently and therefore collapse into a more concentrated quasi - equilibrium state before forming stars than clusters formed from low - metallicity gas .",
    "any of these three scenarios comes with limiting assumptions and is likely not the single cause for the measured gc size difference as the variety of results described above indicates .    to provide a larger and statistically robust dataset to constrain gc sizes as a function of galactocentric radius , we embarked on a wide - field observing campaign covering a large area with an hst / acs mosaic out to several effective radii ( @xmath29 ) of the diffuse spheroid light around ngc1399 , the central galaxy in the fornax galaxy cluster that hosts one of the richest ( @xmath30 gcs ; specific frequency , relative to the absolute @xmath31-band luminosity of the host galaxy , @xmath32 , which is normalized to @xmath33 mag .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive high spatial - resolution imaging study of globular clusters ( gcs ) in ngc1399 , the central giant elliptical cd galaxy in the fornax galaxy cluster , conducted with the _ advanced camera for surveys _ ( acs ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .  using a novel technique to construct drizzled psf libraries for hst / acs data </S>",
    "<S> , we accurately determine the fidelity of gc structural parameter measurements from detailed artificial star cluster experiments and show the superior robustness of the gc half - light radius , @xmath0 , compared with other gc structural parameters , such as king core and tidal radius . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath0 for the major fraction of the ngc1399 gc system reveals a trend of increasing @xmath0 versus galactocentric distance , @xmath1 , out to about 10kpc and a flat relation beyond . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is very similar for blue and red gcs which are found to have a mean size ratio of @xmath2 at all galactocentric radii from the core regions of the galaxy out to @xmath3kpc .  </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the size difference between blue and red gcs is due to _ internal _ mechanisms related to the evolution of their constituent stellar populations .  </S>",
    "<S> modeling the mass density profile of ngc1399 shows that additional _ </S>",
    "<S> external _ </S>",
    "<S> dynamical mechanisms are required to limit the gc size in the galaxy halo regions to @xmath4 pc . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this may be realized by an exotic gc orbit distribution function , an extended dark matter halo , and/or tidal stress induced by the increased stochasticity in the dwarf halo substructure at larger galactocentric distances . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the gc @xmath0 distribution functions in various galaxies and find that the fraction of extended gcs with @xmath5pc is systematically larger in late - type galaxies compared with gc systems in early - type galaxies .  </S>",
    "<S> this is likely due to the dynamically more violent evolution of early - type galaxies .  </S>",
    "<S> we match our gc @xmath0 measurements with radial velocity data from the literature and split the resulting sample at the median @xmath0 value into compact and extended gcs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that compact gcs show a significantly smaller line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath6 km </S>",
    "<S> s@xmath7 , than their extended counterparts , @xmath8 km s@xmath7 .  considering the weaker statistical correlation in the gc @xmath0-color and the gc @xmath0-@xmath1 relations , the more significant gc size - dynamics relation appears to be astrophysically more relevant and hints at the dominant influence of the gc orbit distribution function on the evolution of gc structural parameters . </S>"
