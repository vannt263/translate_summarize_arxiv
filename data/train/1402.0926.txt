    "( dps ) , after the corresponding shape of the juggler s diabolo top . initially discovered within optics by hamilton in the conical refraction of light @xcite , dps were made prominent by berry @xcite , who showed that a system acrues a phase when it evolves adiabatically through a closed path in parameter space enclosing the dp : the berry phase , or more precisely , a topological berry phase @xcite .",
    "due to such topological phase and their peculiar energy dispersion , dps have numerous important consequences , for example in molecular reactions @xcite , conical refraction in crystal optics @xcite , molecular spectra @xcite , neutral atoms in optical lattices @xcite , and honeycomb photonic systems @xcite .",
    "when entire electronic bands possess dps , such as discovered in graphene and topological insulators , in their vicinity the electrons behave as massless fermions obeying the dirac equation @xcite , and the diabolical points are known as dirac points .",
    "this discovery has generated enormous interest and there are many works generalizing the graphene - type model to other physical systems and exploring the associated topological properties @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath2 topological phase of such dirac fermions affects the quantum interference corrections to the conductivity , as found in experiments on topological insulators ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we study here diabolical points in the coordinate space of cooperative many - body optomechanical systems .",
    "the specific realization we focus on is a one - dimensional ring cavity with an embedded distributed bragg reflector ( dbr ) formed by moveable individual reflectors .",

    "mode interactions in fabry - perot cavities could give rise to dps by taking into account three - dimensional features , e.g. , the tilt - angle of the scattering elements @xcite .",
    "however , within the 1d model considered here , periodic boundary conditions are a necessary feature to observe dps .",
    "besides their spectroscopic characterization , dps are most interesting for their consequences on the system s dynamics .",
    "in particular , we show that a topological berry phase can be realized by different types of parameterized cyclic motion of the scatterers . while a geometric phase generally takes arbitrary continuous values , depending on the detailed local structure of the closed adiabatic path ( see ref . for an example in optomechanics ) , in the special case of a dp the associated berry phase is _ only _ a function of the winding number around the dp .",
    "for this reason this type of berry phase is non - local , i.e. , any homologically equivalent path encircling the dp acquires identical discrete phases : it is a more robust phenomenon denoted as a topological phase and bears a strict relation with the aharonov - bohm or aharonov - casher effect ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) .",

    "such model of a dp also establishes an analogy to parabolic quantum dots in semiconductors with a general form of spin - orbit coupling ( rashba plus dresselhaus @xcite ) . in the optomechanical system , however , the ` electron ' spin is allowed to have an arbitrary value @xmath3 , determined by the total number of photons .",

    "notice also that the effective crystal axes ( determined by the spin - orbit coupling terms ) do not coincide in general with the principal axes of the trapping potential , since the coordinate rotation involves the 2d harmonic confinement as well .    for an optomechanical coupling of the form @xmath208 , the harmonic excitation spectrum of independent @xmath209 phonons",
    "is not affected ( the optical cavity only introduces a displaced equilibrium position for oscillator @xmath210 ) . on the other hand",

    "we thus see ( in this weak - coupling limit ) that the presence of a diabolical point is reflected in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) , which entails an interaction between the two mechanical modes @xmath215 , mediated by the cavity through @xmath218 . when @xmath159=0 $ ] , it is not difficult to check using eqs .",
    "( [ phi]-[omega_pm ] ) that the more usual optomechanical coupling linear in @xmath155 is recovered .",
    "for example , if for definiteness @xmath219 , the coupling has the form @xmath220 with @xmath166 independent of @xmath155 ( since @xmath221 ) . in this case , the first term in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) is simply the shift in mechanical energy due to the displaced equilibrium position , proportional to @xmath222 , while the second term is absent .",
    "a particularly transparent result is obtained for two identical oscillators , i.e. , @xmath223 . in that case , the last term of eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) is @xmath224 , where the orbital angular momentum @xmath225 is a conserved quantity in the unperturbed hamiltonian ( due to the circular 2d confinement ) .",
    "this type of coupling is well known in quantum dots @xcite where the first term in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) is simply a constant , since @xmath226 . in general the effective hamiltonian of the optical cavity",
    "is given by both terms in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) , which only depend on the mechanical angular momentum @xmath227 .",
    "conversely , we see that inducing a non - zero value of @xmath228 favors a certain chirality of the mechanical motion , i.e. , a finite value of @xmath227 through the @xmath229 coupling .",
    "this picture is particularly intuitive in our setup as @xmath230 implies a larger occupation of one of the clockwise / counterclockwise modes of the toroidal cavity [ see eq .",

    "this , according to eq .",
    "( [ h_eff ] ) allows one to transfer angular momentum to the 2d mechanical oscillator .",
    "we have discussed conical intersections of optical eigenmodes based on a ring cavity with movable scatterers .",
    "characteristic phenomena associated with the presence of dps , such as the topological berry phase and adiabatic transduction of photons between optical branches , can be realized in such an optomechanical setup .",
    "the berry phase generated through a dp has a topological character , similar to the aharonov - bohm and aharonov - casher topological phases , which is distinct from other realizations of geometrical phases in optomechanics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , taylor expansion of the cavity frequency on the small mechanical displacements breaks down at the diabolical point due to the non - analytic spectrum and the dependence of the eigenmodes through ratios of the mechanical displacements . besides a classical analysis of the ring cavity with deformable dbr",
    ", we demonstrate the dp features by a minimal quantum model which , interestingly , provides an optomechanical simulation of parabolic quantum dots with spin - orbit interaction .",
    "we thus establish a connection with semiconductor physics and quantum gases , where synthetic generation of spin - orbit interactions has recently attracted considerable interest @xcite .",
    "similarly to the latter case @xcite , the optomechanical model can also extend the well - known semiconductor hamiltonian to large - spin particles .",
    "a full characterization of the quantized dynamics around the dp seems of particular interest for future investigations .",
    "for example , we expect that a more general class of coherent transformations of the optical field can be realized by going beyond the adiabatic limit , since landau - zener - type physics becomes relevant slightly away from the degeneracy point .",
    "the creation of entanglement between optical and mechanical degrees of freedom could be realized in analogy to proposals with interacting ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "however , optomechanical effects not captured by our eq .",
    "( [ dp_quantum ] ) could play an important role .",
    "corrections to the non - diagonal terms @xmath231 which become larger with the mechanical velocities @xmath232 were discussed @xcite and would affect the landau - zener transition probability . these effects are usually negligible , due to the large mismatch between optical and mechanical frequencies , but should become relevant in the proximity of the dp .",
    "non - diagonal terms , close to the dp , could also be exploited for photon transduction through a resonant interaction between the mechanical motion and the optical cavity @xcite .",
    "finally , the scheme described here is relevant for a variety of optomechanical systems , as in particular micro - toroidal rings with indentations @xcite and near - field scatterers @xcite , but is also applicable to microwave optomechanics  @xcite and circuit qed setups ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "making use of the formulas for the ring cavity , we revisit here the problem of a fabry - perot cavity with embedded dbr .",
    "the transfer matrix @xmath33 is the same of the ring cavity , but the boundary condition reads : @xmath233 which , summing the two components and using @xmath234 and @xmath235 , gives @xmath236 if we consider that the unperturbed dbr is in the transmissive regime , i.e. , @xmath237 in eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ bc_fp ] ) @xmath238 , which is related to the parity ( even / odd ) of the optical eigenmode .",
    "expansion in the small parameters @xmath239 gives : @xmath240 where @xmath241 has the same form of eq .",
    "( [ dmdx ] ) but the diagonal elements are given by @xmath242 while @xmath243 is unchanged .",

    "( [ sin_mode ] ) , derived for a periodic cavity . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ kpm_fp ] ) differs from the corresponding expression given in @xcite , due to the fact that the @xmath247 contribution to the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ kpm_fp ] ) was missed in eq .",
    "( s.20 ) of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this @xmath248 term has a small effect in certain parameter regimes , considered by @xcite .",
    "in fact , by taking @xmath249 , we obtain from eq .",
