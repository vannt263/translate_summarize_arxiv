    "as we recall in sec .",
    "[ sec : sbgas ] , it is necessary in such a framework to consider a phenomenological temperature - dependent gluon mass ( or thermal gluon mass ) in order to reproduce the lattice data .",
    "various authors have proposed a procedure to treat statistically systems whose hamiltonian depends on temperature : in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors start with the usual partition function and simply replace the constant gluon mass , @xmath13 , by a temperature - dependent one , @xmath14 , which leads to an invariant expression for the pressure whereas the energy and entropy are modified in order to satisfy standard thermodynamical relations between those quantities . in ref .",

    "all these three formulations are obviously not equivalent and there is still a debate to know which one , if any , is correct . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tdepend ] , we propose a way to clarify the situation starting from the first principles of statistical mechanics while in sec .",
    "[ sec : gplas ] we show that all these formulations found in the literature demand similar temperature - dependent gluon masses to reproduce the lattice data .",
    "it implies that , at a qualitative level , those formulations are rather equally good .",

    "note that we work in units where @xmath18 , @xmath19 being boltzmann s constant .",
    "most of the quasiparticle models reach the same conclusion about the qualitative behavior of the thermal gluon mass : just beyond the critical temperature @xmath0 , the gluon mass has to be large and to decrease up to @xmath20 .",
    "then , for even larger @xmath21 , it increases essentially linearly .",
    "we interpret the large value of the gluon mass around @xmath0 as a signal of strong color interactions among gluons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : glue ] , we take those interactions into account by considering the gluon plasma as an ideal gas of glueballs and gluons , the color interactions being responsible for the formation of glueballs . we show that the lattice data can be reproduced if the ratio between the number of glueballs and gluons , @xmath22 , decreases monotonically when @xmath21 increases so that a small value is reached when the temperature is larger than the dissociation temperature of the glueball .",
    "the glueball mass and dissociation temperature are computed using a spinless salpeter equation ( to take relativistic effects into account ) , the potential is obtained from lattice qcd  @xcite and , to be consistent , the gluon mass is a linear function of @xmath21 with the same slope as the one obtained from the asymptotic analysis performed in the quasiparticle formalism . finally , some conclusions and outlook are given in sec .",

    "in particular , it can not reproduce simultaneously some of the important characteristics summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] :    1 .",
    "for @xmath12 , the energy density apparently saturates around 4.712 , which is about @xmath37 below the stefan - boltzmann constant @xmath38 ( the gap is even of about @xmath39 when one considers @xmath40 @xcite ) , 2 .   around the critical temperature , the energy density increases very fast with a mean slope roughly equal to 26 , 3 .",
    "the maximum of the interaction measure is located at @xmath41 and its value is about 2.6 , 4 .   the decay of the interaction measure is given in good approximation by @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , a model with constant mass predicts that energy density , entropy density , and pressure will quickly saturate at the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "it is already enough to discard the model if we consider that the saturation occurs at the smaller value given above , namely 4.712 instead of 5.264 .",
    "however , even if we consider that lattice data did not yet saturate , the following arguments show that a model with a constant gluon mass is not able to reproduce these data since their four features enumerated above imply four very different values of the ratio @xmath43 . at @xmath44 ,",
    "the value of the energy ( [ energy0b ] ) is equal to the lattice value 4.712 if @xmath45 , which implies @xmath46 .",
    "but the slope of the energy ( [ energy0b ] ) can be bounded from above : @xmath47 consequently , around @xmath0 , the derivative of the energy density is smaller than around @xmath48 , which implies @xmath49 to reproduce the data . the interaction measure ( [ inter ] ) has a maximum located at @xmath50 and the value of the maximum is equal to @xmath51 ( far from 2.6 obtained in lattice qcd ) . to reproduce the position of the maximum obtained from lattice data we find that @xmath52 .",
    "at last , the decay of the interaction measure predicted by this model for large enough temperature is @xmath53 . again to reproduce the data , we need @xmath54 .",
    "it is a simple exercise to verify that even with a degeneracy factor , @xmath28 , considered as a free constant parameter , one can not get a good quantitative agreement between this model and the lattice data in the whole available temperature range .",
    "another version of this simple model is obtained by introducing a cutoff , @xmath55 , for small momenta in eqs .",
    "( [ thermo1 ] ) as in refs .",
    "the physical motivation of such a cutoff is that , near the critical temperature , gluons with low momenta should be bound into glueballs and should thus not contribute to thermodynamical quantities related to an ideal gas of gluons .",
    "it is easy to see that this modified model predicts also a quick saturation of the energy density , entropy density , and pressure at the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "moreover the additional parameter @xmath55 does not help to describe the large value of the derivative of the energy density around @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen by using arguments similar to the ones given above when @xmath56 or by looking at the various figures of refs .",
    "another possibility is to consider a cutoff , @xmath57 , which depends on the temperature as in ref .",
    "@xcite . to have a relevant physical meaning",
    ", @xmath57 should be a decreasing function of @xmath21 since one expects that , for high enough temperatures , glueballs will not be present in the plasma ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec : glue ] ) .",
    "using arguments similar to the ones developed to get the general form of @xmath14 in sec .",
    "[ ssec : genem ] , one can prove that indeed , around @xmath0 , we have @xmath58 .",
    "however , to reproduce the saturation of the thermodynamical quantities below the stefan - boltzmann constant , the cutoff must increase linearly with @xmath21 for large enough temperatures .",
    "qualitatively , the shape of @xmath57 would be similar to the one of @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "this behavior of @xmath57 for large @xmath21 is problematic and its physical meaning is not obvious .      for the reasons mentioned above ,",
    "various authors have considered that a temperature - dependent gluon mass is the most relevant ingredient to be added to this model  @xcite .",
    "indeed , since energy density , entropy density , and pressure are decreasing functions of @xmath59 , a simple way to make them saturate below the stefan - boltzmann constant for large @xmath21 is to have a mass @xmath14 such that @xmath60 saturates to a non - vanishing constant in this regime of temperature .",
    "this implies that one must have @xmath61    although @xmath62 is mostly a phenomenological parameter that has to be fitted in order to reproduce the lattice results , the thermal gluon mass can be related to another important parameter characterizing a plasma , that is the plasma frequency . in a qed plasma for example",
    ", photons can not propagate with a frequency below the plasma frequency .",
    "the situation is similar in the quark - gluon plasma : gluons ( plasmons ) can not propagate as free particles if their energy is too low .",
    "in fact , gluons acquire a thermal mass which is the plasma frequency .",
    "perturbative calculations confirm that point : to leading order , the thermal gluon mass , also proportional to the debye mass at large temperatures  @xcite , has been found to be proportional to @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "following standard notation , @xmath64 with @xmath65 the strong coupling constant .",
    "higher - order contributions have been calculated in the literature ; it appears that the perturbative expansion converges very slowly and thus that the leading - order result is only valid at very high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath66 varies more slowly than @xmath21 , the linear behavior of the thermal gluon mass is found to be dominant at very large @xmath21 in perturbative qcd .",
    "the constraint  ( [ constm ] ) is thus in good qualitative agreement with already known results .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a resummation of the leading - order formulas leads to a modification of the thermal gluon mass that improves the convergence of the results toward the stefan - boltzman limit .",
    "see in particular ref .",
    "@xcite , focusing on the convergence of the pressure , and ref .",
    "@xcite in which the hard thermal loop perturbation theory is successfully applied to reproduce lattice data at finite chemical potential within a quasiparticle approach .",
    "higher - order perturbative calculations also give good results  @xcite .",
    "in a phenomenological model describing the gluon plasma , it is quite natural to assume that such a plasma can be seen as some gas of quasiparticles , or quasigluons , as many authors have done in previous works ( see the introduction ) .",
    "standard statistical mechanics is the necessary framework to deal with gases of quasigluon .",
    "but , as we stressed in the previous section , a qualitative description of the pure glue lattice data demands the introduction of a temperature - dependent mass for the quasigluons .",
    "such a thermal mass also emerges from qcd itself , as shown within perturbation theory .",
    "the problem is that standard statistical mechanics only deals with hamiltonians which do not explicitly depend on temperature . there is a debate in the literature about how it should be modified in such a case to be consistent . in this section ,",
    "we propose an extension of statistical mechanics aiming at treating temperature - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "our procedure does not only allow to recover other existing formalisms in a unified way , it also leads to another new formulation which preserves the standard definition of energy , entropy , and pressure .",
    "we first consider classical systems in equilibrium in the canonical ensemble and restrict our study to reversible processes to keep the discussion as simple as possible .",
    "then the case of an ideal quantum gas of bosons , relevant for our study , is presented .",
    "let us consider a probability density which is a function of the hamiltonian @xmath67 : @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is the density of probability of finding the dynamical variables of the system , namely @xmath70 , within some volume of the phase space .",
    "we assume here that the hamiltonian depends explicitly on the temperature @xmath21 .",
    "the form of the function @xmath69 can be determined using standard procedures ; we give here the main ideas and refer the reader to standard textbooks for more details like , for example , ref .",
    "consider two subsystems @xmath59 and @xmath71 with hamiltonians @xmath72 and @xmath73 at equilibrium .",
    "the probabilities to find the subsystem @xmath59 within the phase - space volume @xmath74 and @xmath71 within @xmath75 are given respectively by @xmath76 and by @xmath77 following the definition of the probability density .",
    "consider then the system @xmath78 obtained by combining the two subsystems @xmath59 and @xmath71 .",
    "the probability to find both @xmath59 within @xmath74 and @xmath71 within @xmath75 , hence to find @xmath78 within @xmath79 , is given by @xmath80 .",
    "if the system @xmath78 is also at equilibrium , we can write that @xmath81 . neglecting the interaction between @xmath59 and @xmath71 , we have that @xmath82 and @xmath83 the intuitive idea underlying this constraint is that the description of a given system as a whole or as composed of two subsystems at equilibrium must be equivalent . such a functional equation has a unique non trivial solution : @xmath84 where @xmath85 , and @xmath16 are arbitrary constants with respect to the dynamical variables .",
    "consequently , the general form of the normalized probability density is @xmath86 where we have introduced the partition function @xmath87 although it does no longer play a central role in the present formulation . for the moment , @xmath16 is still arbitrary and will be fixed later .",
    "we recall that @xmath88 denotes an integration on the phase space of the system .    another elegant way to obtain the expression  ( [ norm - prob ] ) for the probability density is to use the so - called maximum - entropy estimate . according to jaynes  @xcite , this is the least biased possible estimate on the available information .",
    "he showed that the form  ( [ norm - prob ] ) maximizes the entropy of the probability distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ the shannon s measure @xcite , given by @xmath89 where we have introduced the notation @xmath90 for the phase - space average of the quantity @xmath91 .",
    "notice that , in this formulation , @xmath16 is a lagrangian multiplier and , as above , does not depend on the dynamical variables .",
    "one advantage of this derivation is that it shows straightforwardly the intimate link between entropy and probability density .",
    "the next quantity we consider is the energy , defined as the averaged hamiltonian @xmath92    the only unknown in the above relations is @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that this parameter depends only on the temperature @xmath21 in the following way : @xmath93 the function @xmath94 in assumed to be positive , monotonic and such that @xmath95 so that the function @xmath96 can be unambiguously defined . in order to determine @xmath97 , we use the laws of thermodynamics , that give a relation between energy , entropy and @xmath97 .",
    "the first law links the variation of internal energy , @xmath98 , of heat , @xmath99 , and of work , @xmath100 , as follows : @xmath101 . for reversible processes we have @xmath102 .",
    "the second law relates the variation of heat with the variation of entropy : @xmath103 ( the equality holds for reversible processes only ) . assuming that both the internal energy and the entropy are functions of @xmath16  thus implicitly of @xmath21  and of @xmath26 , and combining the first and the second laws of thermodynamics , we obtain @xmath104 equating the terms in @xmath105 and @xmath106",

    "( [ fbeta - def ] ) and , in the thermodynamical limit , the following expression for the pressure @xmath108 equation ( [ link - energy - entropy ] ) is the relation that allows to determine @xmath97 and to know the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath21 through eq .",
    "( [ fbeta - def ] ) . indeed , substituting expression ( [ norm - prob ] ) into the definition ( [ entropy - def ] ) of the entropy and using eq .",
    "( [ energy - def ] ) , we obtain @xmath109 the derivation with respect to @xmath16 of the entropy leads to @xmath110 a comparison between eqs .",

    "( [ fbeta - def ] ) , the function @xmath114 .",
    "the integration constant @xmath115 can be constrained ( sometime even fixed ) by imposing that @xmath97 is positive , bounded and monotonic for @xmath116 .",

    ", we give an explicit example in appendix  [ app : tdepend ] .    in this approach , the entropy , energy , and pressure are given respectively by their usual expressions  ( [ entropy - def ] ) , ( [ energy - def ] ) , and ( [ pression - def ] ) .",
    "but , the dependence on @xmath21 of the hamiltonian enforces a particular link between @xmath16 and @xmath21 , that can be found through the resolution of the nontrivial relation  ( [ fbeta ] ) . in standard problems , @xmath120 and",
    "one recovers the well - known link @xmath121 as a solution of eq .",

    "( [ fbeta ] ) if one wants to extract physical informations about the system under study . equation ( [ fbeta ] ) can only be solved once the dependence on temperature of the hamiltonian is explicitly known . however in the context of gluon plasma , the thermal mass of the gluons is unknown and must be determined from lattice data .",
    "that is why it is of interest to find more tractable ways of dealing with temperature - dependent hamiltonians .",
    "as we show in the following , our procedure allows to find such formulations , that corresponds to frameworks already in use in the literature .",

    "second , it is readily observed that another equivalent rewriting of eq .",
    "( [ deriv - entropy ] ) is @xmath127 where we have introduced a new form , @xmath128 , for the energy .",

    "( [ link - energy - entropy ] ) provided that we choose also @xmath125 . the modified pressure is given by eq .",
    "( [ pression - def ] ) where @xmath98 is replaced by @xmath128 . in this formulation ,",
    "the standard expressions for the entropy and for @xmath16 are preserved but the expressions for the energy and pressure are modified . in particular , the energy is no longer the average of the hamiltonian .",
    "this formalism was first proposed in ref .",

    "but in this case , the entropy and the energy will be modified since the laws of thermodynamics demand that @xmath130 , with @xmath131 : a term in @xmath132 appears because of the @xmath133 term .",
    "these three alternative solutions are derived from the laws of thermodynamics where the usual link @xmath125 is kept , but each one requires the standard form of the thermodynamical quantities to be modified .",
    "we think that the formalism developed in the previous section is the most fundamental one since it only demands a redefinition of @xmath16 , which is only a lagrangian multiplier .",
    "moreover , this redefinition of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath21 is only local since this is done through the differential equation ( [ fbeta ] ) : @xmath134 when @xmath135 . in contrast , the corrections to the thermodynamic quantities obtained from the alternative formulations derived in this section are non - local ; they involve an integral over some range of temperatures , see eqs .",
    "( [ new - entropy ] ) and ( [ new - energy ] ) .",
    "this implies that even if @xmath135 in some large interval of temperatures , the corrections can be quite significant if the integration is performed over an interval of @xmath21 for which the hamiltonian depends on @xmath21 .",

    "it is indeed widely accepted that , at the critical temperature @xmath0 , the medium undergoes a phase transition and becomes deconfined .",
    "it does not mean however that the color interactions vanish : they are actually screened because of the great amount of color charges in the medium , and the residual potential is no longer confining as for @xmath205 .",
    "these residual color interactions can be rather important for @xmath206 , as suggested by several lattice qcd studies  @xcite .",

    "our main physical assumption is then the following : since @xmath209 is the thermal gluon mass in a temperature range when the gluons are free , it can be seen as the rest mass of a free gluon for any @xmath211 .",
    "let us now consider that @xmath212 , _ i.e. _ that the color interactions become dominant near @xmath0 .",
    "then , by squaring eq .",
    "( [ disper2 ] ) , one gets @xmath213 and consequently @xmath214 since the potential term dominates the right hand side .    we are thus led to the following interpretation for @xmath14 : at large @xmath21 ( region iii in fig .

    "the most favored glueball from an energetic point of view is thus a two - gluon bound state with the gluon pair in a color singlet .",

    "it appears that the two - gluon ground state , corresponding to the scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs , remains bound up to @xmath251 .",
    "we have then proposed a last description of the gluon plasma , in which this medium is seen as a ideal mixture of free gluons and colorless glueballs .",
    "the agreement with lattice qcd is as good as with the previous approaches , with a glueball abundance that is very large near the critical temperature , takes the lower value of 33% at the dissociation temperature of the lightest glueballs , and becomes negligible after @xmath253 , where even continuum glueball resonances are expected to disappear  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation of the gluon plasma draws a bridge between the quasiparticle approach and other models focusing on the existence of bound states after deconfinement  @xcite .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", the main result of the present study is the prediction that the gluon plasma , and thus presumably the quark - gluon plasma , might be a glueball - rich medium in the early stages after deconfinement .",
    "this brings support to previous studies arguing that an important amount of glueballs can be formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the experimental detection of the scalar glueball in the quark - gluon plasma could be achieved through the scenario developed in refs .",
    "@xcite which roughly suggests that , although the bare scalar glueball would be nearly stable in the quark - gluon plasma , it should mix with scalar mesons .",
    "then , such a  physical \" glueball , denoted as @xmath267 , could decay mostly in the channels @xmath268 and @xmath269 through its mesonic component , leading to an enhancement of the number of events versus the two - photon ( or two - pion ) invariant mass . in our model , the bare glueball mass is mostly located around @xmath270  gev ; a peak in the @xmath271 or @xmath272 channels",
    "can thus be expected not too far of @xmath270  gev , depending on the strength of the meson - glueball coupling .",
    "we finally stress that , if quarks were included in our model , the number of bound states above the critical temperature would increase since mesons , diquarks , quark - gluon states , _ etc .",
    "_ can also form .",
    "we leave the extension of our approach to the full quark - gluon plasma for future works .",
    "the effects of a nonzero chemical potential will also be leaved for subsequent studies .",
    "the authors thank vincent mathieu , francesco giacosa and o. kaczmarek for useful discussions and suggestions about the present work .",
    "f. buisseret thanks the f.r.s .- fnrs belgium for financial support .",
    "f. brau acknowledges financial support from a return grant delivered by the federal scientific politics .",
    "in order to illustrate the general procedure given in sec .  [ ssec : genef ] , we study the particular case of a classical ideal gas with temperature - dependent mass @xmath14 , or equivalently @xmath273 because of the definition  ( [ fbeta - def ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath274 and one finds that , for system of @xmath275 particles , @xmath276^{3n/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the volume of the system .",
    "the normalized probability density is thus known and it can be computed that @xmath277 where the prime denotes a partial derivation with respect to the argument of the considered function . these last two equalities allow to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fbeta ] ) as @xmath278    let us consider the following form for @xmath14 to illustrate the procedure @xmath279 with @xmath280 .",
    "the equation for @xmath97 then reads @xmath281 to determine uniquely the function @xmath112 , we need a boundary condition . for @xmath282 , the mass tends to @xmath187 which is constant . in this limit ,",
    "one recover the standard statistical mechanics and @xmath121 .",
    "consequently the boundary condition is @xmath283 .",
    "the unique solution of the nonlinear differential equation ( [ tempf ] ) is then @xmath284 the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath21 is then given by @xmath285 for @xmath286 ( or @xmath287 ) , we just recover the standard relation @xmath148 . in this formalism , we also find that @xmath288      we can now compare this last energy formula with the energy obtained within models 1 and 2 . for the model 1 , where the expression for the energy is preserved , we simply have the standard expression @xmath291 while for the model 2 , where the expression for the entropy is preserved , the energy takes the form ( remember that in this formalism @xmath148 ) @xmath292_{\\nu=1/t^*}^{\\nu=1/t}.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correction to the energy ( @xmath293 ) can be compared for each formalism .",
    "of course , for model 1 , this correction is vanishing ; in this case corrections would be associated to the entropy .",
    "consequently , in fig .  [ fig11 ]",
    ", we compare only corrections to the energy obtained with model 2 and with the new formalism proposed in this paper together with the evolution of the mass as functions of the temperature @xmath294 .",
    "we notice that the corrections to the energy from model 2 ( and corrections to the entropy from model 1 ) are non - local since they involve integrals over some range in temperature , see eqs .",
    "( [ new - entropy ] ) and  ( [ new - energy ] ) .",
    "this means that those corrections are still significative in regions where the mass is essentially constant ( in this example the corrections are logarithmic in @xmath21 ) while the corrections to the energy from the new formalism are essentially localized around the region where the mass depends significantly on the temperature .",
    "this is indeed what we expect : if the hamiltonian does not essentially depend on @xmath21 over some large interval of temperature , the statistical mechanics in this interval of @xmath21 should be essentially the same than the standard statistical mechanics .",
