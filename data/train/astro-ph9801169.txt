    "identification and analysis of long wavelength counterparts of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) has for many years been considered a promising path towards understanding the nature of the burst events .",
    "but while many attempts have been made to identify grb counterparts ( schaefer _ et  al .",
    "_ 1987 , schaeffer 1992 , fenimore _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ 1993 , larson 1997 ) until recently the uncertainties in the position of the gamma - ray sources proved too large to allow sufficiently sensitive surveys for associated optical transients ( ots ) .",
    "the situation improved dramatically in early 1997 , when gamma- and x - ray observations by the bepposax satellite provided a sub - arcminute position of burst grb  970228 , allowing the first firm optical identification of a fading grb counterpart ( van paradijs _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "a second optical grb counterpart , this time of grb  970508 , was discovered two months later ( bond 1997 , djorgovski _",
    "et  al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .    although broadly similar in their fading behavior , phenomenological differences between the two counterparts in the weeks after their discoveries seemed to compound rather than clarify the mystery of the grbs .",
    "hst imagery of grb  970228 suggested the presence of a nebulosity centered @xmath5  arcsecond from the point - like fading transient source ( sahu _ et  al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , while no extended source brighter than @xmath6 has been found near grb  970508 ( pian _ et  al .",
    "_ 1997 ) . furthermore ,",
    "a proper motion of 550  mas  yr@xmath7 was reported ( caraveo _ et  al .",
    "_ 1997 ) for grb  970228 , though the measurement was disputed ( sahu _ et  al .  _",
    "additionally , tentative evidence for the fading of the adjacent nebulosity ( metzger _ et  al .  _",
    "1997a ) was proposed .",
    "either result would ineluctably lead to the conclusion that grb  970228 was a galactic event .",
    "in contrast , the measurement of absorption lines with redshift @xmath8 in the spectrum of grb  970508 ( metzger _ et  al .  _",
    "1997b ) demonstrates its extragalactic nature .    to help resolve the situation",
    ", we have reobserved the grb  970228 with hst six months after the initial outburst .",
    "although the earlier hst observations of grb  970228 employed wfpc2 , we have availed ourselves of the newly installed stis ccd camera .",
    "the excellent throughput and broad bandpass of this instrument , combined with the long time baseline since the gamma - ray burst , provide us with a superb opportunity to study the nature of the source and its environment .",
    "the field of grb  970228 was imaged during two hst orbits on 1997  september  4 from 15:50:33 to 18:22:41 ut , using the stis ccd in clear aperture ( 50ccd ) mode .",
    "two exposures of 575s each were taken at each of four dither positions for a total exposure time of 4600s .",
    "the exposures were dithered to allow removal of hot pixels and to obtain the highest possible resolution .",
    "the images were bias and dark subtracted , and flat - fielded using the stis pipeline .",
    "the final image was created and cleaned of cosmic rays and hot pixels using the drizzle and blot algorithms developed for the hubble deep field ( hdf ) ( williams _ et  al .",
    "_ 1996 , fruchter and hook 1997 ) .",
    "an output pixel size of @xmath9 across , or one - half the size of the input pixels , was used .",
    "the magnitude of the ot was determined from the drizzle image via aperture photometry .",
    "the flux in an aperture of radius four drizzled pixels , or @xmath10 , was determined , and our best estimate of the surrounding nebular background was subtracted .",
    "an aperture correction of @xmath11 magnitudes was derived for this aperture using the bright star visible in figure 1 to the west of the nebula .",
    "we find a total magnitude for the point source ot of @xmath12 .    in figure  2",
    "we plot the magnitude of the ot as a function of time since the burst last february .",
    "the stis magnitude has been converted to r by interpolating the wfpc2 v and i colors .",
    "a power law of the form @xmath13 has been fitted to the hst points and extrapolated back to earlier times .",
    "we find a best fit of @xmath14 .",
    "all non - hst photometry has been adjusted under the assumption that the r magnitude of the nebula is 25.3 , which was obtained by interpolating the stsis v and wfpc2 i measurements ( see below ) .",
    "we determined the magnitude of the nebula by summing all pixels in a region of approximately @xmath15 sq .",
    "arcsec . surrounding the object .",
    "the flux of the point source was then subtacted from the sum .",
    "we derive a magnitude of @xmath16 for the nebula . due to the very wide bandpass of the stis clear observations",
    "( the only constraint on the bandpass comes from the optics and the response of the ccd ) , the primary source of photometric error is the correction of the stis magnitude for the color of the object .",
    "this is particularly large for the nebula , as the only measurement of the color of this object comes from the previous , rather noisy , planetary camera observations of the field ( these images are discussed in more detail in the next section ) .    in order to determine whether the optical transient displayed proper motion or the nebula faded we have compared the stis images to the previous hst wfpc2 images obtained obtained of grb  970228 ( sahu _ et  al .  _",
    "the images taken on march  26 with wfpc2 provide a baseline of 162 days and are used here to look for proper motion of the optical transient .",
    "the positions of the four reference stars used in sahu _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997b ) agree with their positions in the stis images to within the expected uncertainties of 2 to 3 mas , which shows that the transformations between the two images have been done correctly .",
    "the uncertainty in the position of the ot is about 10 mas in each of the two colors .",
    "we find that any motion of the grb between the two epochs is less than about 16 mas .",
    "this corresponds to a motion of less than 36 mas per year .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath17 less than the value claimed by caraveo _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "( 1997 ) , and improves the upper limit on the proper motion reported by sahu _ et  al .  _",
    "( 1997b ) by a factor of six .",
    "to check on the photometry of the optical transient and nebula , the point source magnitude was determined by using circular apertures of radii 1 and 3 pixels in the wfpc2 images and adjusting the observed fluxes according to the aperture corrections found by holtzman _",
    "et  al .  _",
    "the nebular magnitude was redetermined in the wfpc2 images by taking the sum of all counts above sky in a box approximately @xmath18 , and subtracting the counts ( estimated as above ) attributable to the point source .",
    "the position of this box was determined by the position of the nebula in the stis image .",
    "it is , however , somewhat larger than the observed nebula in all directions .",
    "averaging together the two wfpc2 observations , we obtain an i magnitude of @xmath19 and a v magnitude of @xmath20 .",
    "these magnitudes are easily consistent with the stis observation .",
    "we have also re - examined the ntt observation of march 13 ( galama _ et  al .",
    "_ 1997 ) to further test whether the nebular magnitude may have varied with time .",
    "we have again used the stellar image @xmath21 to the west of the ot as a point spread function .",
    "we find that we can subtract a point source from the position of the ot which is fainter than the extrapolation of the power - law , yet which leaves behind a `` neblula '' which is as faint , or fainter than , the hst nebular magnitude .",
    "thus , we find no evidence that the nebula has changed magnitude with time .",
    "there is little room for doubt that the fading point source is associated with the gamma - ray event . between 28 february and 4 september 1997 , the source faded by a factor of about 350 , and as shown in figure 2 , this dramatic fall in luminosity largely followed a power - law whose index , @xmath1 , is within the errors indistinguishable from the index of power - law decline of the optical counterpart to grb  970508 ( pian _ et  al .",
    "given the lack of any other astrophysical objects with similar behavior , and the theoretical prediction of a power - law fall - off with time of the luminosity of afterglow ( meszaros and rees 1997 ) , we believe there is no reasonable alternative to the conclusion that we are observing the optical afterglow of grb  970228 .",
    "furthermore , in simple blast wave models , a break in the power - law to @xmath22 is expected ( wijers , rees and meszaros 1997 ) when the remnant enters a sedov - taylor phase after sweeping up a rest mass energy equal to its initial energy @xmath23 at time : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density of the surrounding medium in protons per cubic centimeter .",
    "however , were the grb a galactic rather than an extragalactic phenomenon , the amount of energy available would only be of order @xmath26 ergs , and for any imaginable density the break would occur on a timescale of days rather than many months .",
    "therefore , the power law fit is in itself a strong argument for the extragalactic nature of the burst .",
    "if the burst is extragalactic , then it is natural to inquire whether the apparently constant nebula seen under the ot is the host galaxy .",
    "the galactic extinction in the direction of grb  970228 has been estimated as @xmath4 ( burstein and heiles 1982 , schlegel , finkbeiner and davis 1997 )  a figure that we have been able to independently verify by comparing the counts and colors of background galaxies in the wfpc2 field with the hdf .",
    "adjusting the surface brightness limit to reflect the @xmath27 mags of extinction in the direction of grb  970228 , we find that only about 2% of the sky in the hdf is covered by galaxies of comparable magnitude , and that the size of the putative host of grb  970228 , while larger than the mean 25th magnitude galaxy in the hdf , is not , by any means , extraordinary .",
    "although we have no spectroscopic information on the redshift of this object nor do we have sufficient colors to attempt a photometric redshift ( though planned nicmos observations may rectify this problem ) , we can attempt to place a crude constraint on the plausible redshift simply from the luminosity of the object . were the object closer than @xmath28 it would be more than four magnitudes fainter than @xmath29 ( lilly _ et  al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , and this is unlikely even given the steep luminosity function at that redshift ( ellis _ et  al .  _ 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the apparent host is as bright as any `` u dropout '' in the hdf ( madau _ et  al .  _",
    "1996 ) , and therefore would be an unusually bright galaxy were it at the typical redshift of these dropouts , @xmath30 .",
    "thus a plausible redshift range for the host is @xmath31 .",
    "however , while the luminosity function of galaxies is a rather blunt instrument for estimating the redshifts of grb hosts , we will show in the journal paper associated with this work that grb hosts may prove a rather better tool for determining the luminosity function of galaxies .",
