    "[ introduction ]    recently , the d0 collaboration reported the evidence of a narrow structure @xmath1 in the @xmath2 decay process based on the @xmath3 collision data at @xmath4  @xcite . given the final states , the @xmath5 should have four different quark flavors @xmath6 .",
    "its mass and width are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . assuming the final @xmath9 in @xmath10 wave , the quantum number is @xmath11 .",
    "other possibility is that the structure decays through the chains of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where the soft photon is not detected . in the later situation ,",
    "the quantum number of the new state would be @xmath14 , and the mass is shifted by adding the mass difference @xmath15 .",
    "whereafter , the lhcb collaboration analysed the @xmath9 invariant mass distribution of @xmath3 collision data at @xmath16 and 8 tev , however , they found no significant excess corresponding to the claimed @xmath1 state  @xcite . also , the cms collaboration failed to observe the @xmath1 structure in the @xmath9 invariant mass distribution  @xcite .",
    "the experimental efforts have immediately attracted great interests and many theoretical studies on the @xmath1 with different interpretations .",
    "considering the mass , production , strong decay , and decay constant , many investigations regard the @xmath1 as a tetraquark state within the framework of qcd sum rule and simple quark model  @xcite , which explantation is suggested by d0 collaboration .",
    "the structures under @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 molecular pictures , dynamically generated states , and hybridized tetraquarks are also proposed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , some works discuss the charmed partners of @xmath1  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the non - resonance interpretations of the @xmath1 structure also exist . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors suggest that @xmath1 may be resulted from the near threshold kinematic effects",
    ". the quite large production rate of @xmath1 can not be understood by the general hadronization mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the comprehensive discussions and reviews on @xmath1 are performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "before the observation of @xmath1 , there have been some studies on open charm and bottom tetraquark states , which mainly focus on their masse spectra  @xcite .",
    "those calculations include diquark - antidiquark picture , compact tetraquark , mixture of quark - antiquark and four quark components , and molecular sceneario , which intends to reveal the nature of @xmath20 .",
    "some calculations indicate the @xmath20 can be treated as a tetraquark state  @xcite , while others give much higher masses of the four quark components than that of @xmath20 as well as the @xmath21 threshold  @xcite . for the molecular scenario ,",
    "most works indicate that a weekly bounded @xmath21 state can be obtained  @xcite , while others suggest the attraction between these two pseudoscalar mesons is not strong enough to form bound state  @xcite . in the open bottom sector ,",
    "higher masses are given in diquark - antidiquark pictures  @xcite , and it is found that the @xmath18 system can be weekly bounded  @xcite .    unlike the @xmath20 , the @xmath1 can not be regarded as a conventional meson or the mixture of quark - antiquark and four quark components due to its four distinct quark flavors .",
    "most of the molecular and dynamically generated states interpretations can not give the right mass and therefore can be excluded  @xcite .",
    "however , the authors argue that the @xmath18 and @xmath17 interactions can generate the @xmath1 dynamically when the next - leading order lagrangian is included  @xcite .",
    "the tetraquark explanation is supported by qcd sum rule and simple quark model  @xcite , but disfavored by the relativistic calculation and general discussions  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to study the open charm and bottom tetraquark masses within a more realistic potential model , which is helpful to disentangle this conflict .    in this work",
    ", we apply the relativized quark model to calculate the masses of diquark and tetraquark states .",
    "the relativized quark model , proposed by godfrey and isgur , has been extensively used to predict the properties of the conventional mesons  @xcite .",
    "it has been concluded that this model gives a unified description of the light mesons , heavy - light mesons and heavy quarkonium , and therefore , it is suitable to deal with the @xmath1 state , in which both light - light and heavy - light systems are included .",
    "moreover , the relativistic effects are also considered in the model , which may be essential for the light quarks .",
    "we perform a calculation in the diquark - antidiquark picture following the route proposed by ebert , faustov , and galkin  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding diquark and antidiquark masses are estimated with the relativized potential firstly , an then treated as the usual antiquark and quark , respectively .",
    "the masses of the tetraquark states are , therefore , obtained by solving the schrdinger - type equation between the diquark and antidiquark . in ref .",
    "@xcite , capstick and isgur adopted the same relativized potential to evaluate the baryon spectra within three body calculations .",
    "the computational schedule is very complicated , and can be hardly extended to study the four quark systems .",
    "we prefer to use the diquark - antidiquark picture to estimate the open charm and bottom tetraquark states in the present work .",
    "we find that our results give much higher masses of @xmath0 tetraquark configuration .",
    "it disfavors the assumption of @xmath1 as a tetraquark state within the diquark - antidiquark scenario .",

    "@xmath29 denotes an operator that has taken account of the relativistic effects according to the relativized scheme .",
    "the explicit forms of these interactions and the details of this relativization procedure can be found in ref .",

    "all the model parameters used in our calculations are taken from ref .",
    "it should be emphasized that these parameters can describe the low lying meson and baryon spectra well even comparing with the recently experimental data . while for the higher excited states , since the discussions of their assignments do not agree with each other theoretically , and they can be hardly employed for fitting the new parameters . since",
    "only the ground states of the tetraquarks are calculated in the present work , where the parameters about the spin - orbit and tensor forces are not employed , we believe that it is enough to describe the ground tetraquark states with the original parameters .    for the diquark , the @xmath32 locates in @xmath10 wave .",
    "the spin - parities of the diquark are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , named as the scalar diquark and axial diquark , respectively .",

    "while the diquark structure is considered , the form factor @xmath50 emerges in the coulomb - like one gluon exchange potential , that is , the @xmath51 term in the quark - antiquark interaction becomes @xmath52 in the diquark - antidiquark interaction .",
    "the @xmath50 , which stands for the internal structure of diquark , can be approximated , with a high accuracy , by the following expression  @xcite @xmath53 where the @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the nonnegative real numbers .",

    "the screen effects due to the finite size of the diquark are totally neglected , namely , the diquark is treated as a point - like antiquark or the distance between the diquark and antidiquark is large enough  @xcite .",
    "the predicted masses of the open charm and bottom tetraquark states in @xmath58 ground states are shown in tab  [ tab2 ] . for the @xmath59 quark content",

    "although the mass of @xmath38 type diquark is higher than that of @xmath10 type , the larger fine splitting induced by the spin - spin interaction can reduce @xmath33 @xmath60 state to be the lowest one .",

    "the selected masses of diquarks are lower than ours , and they are not consistently obtained by solving the quark model potentials .",
    "for example , a set of parameters with @xmath78 and @xmath79 are used to calculate the masses of @xmath80 tetraquarks , in which the lowest @xmath33 states is about 150 mev higher than the @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "if we take those lighter diquark values as the masses of the @xmath38 type diquarks and solve the relativized schrdinger - type equation , we can also obtain a rather low tetraquark mass of 5672 mev .",
    "however , our present consistent calculations both for the diquarks and tetraquarks in the realistic potential does not support the @xmath1 as a tetraquark state .    moreover , we know that the masses of @xmath81 flavor baryons @xmath82 and @xmath83 are 5794 and 5945 mev , respectively .",
    "it is natural to believe that the @xmath59 tetraquarks , containing an additional valence quark , should be above or at least around these two baryon states  @xcite .",
    "another argument is that the tetraquark masses can be estimated by the spin - averaged mass of mesons roughly .",
    "this situation occurs in the study of the @xmath84 masses , where the tetraquark and molecular pictures can both give similar results in the most cases  @xcite .",
    "the spin - averaged mass @xmath85 of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is 6107 mev  @xcite , which is well consistent with the @xmath90 ( @xmath91 case ) in our present calculation .",
    "when the finite size of diquark is considered , the one gluon exchange interaction between the diquark and antidiquark becomes weaker as well as the spin - spin interaction .",
    "the masses of the tetraquarks will increase , while the fine splitting becomes smaller .",
    "this situation is the same as the case adopted by ebert , faustov , and galkin , where the mass of @xmath33 @xmath61 type tetraquark is the lowest and the fine splitting is small  @xcite . in the @xmath92 limit ,",
    "only the linear confining interaction remains , and the three @xmath60 type tetraquark states degenerate .",
    "of course , the @xmath1 can not be described as a tetraquark state even the finite size and form factor of the diquark are taken into account .    in present work ,",
    "we predict many open charm and bottom tetraquark states within the diquark - antidiquark scenario by solving the schrdinger - type equation .",
    "it should be noted that only the mass spectra can not ensure the existences of these states , and their production mechanisms and decay behaviors should also be investigated simultaneously .",
    "the strong decay behaviors are more essential , since the much broader structures can not form or be detected .",
    "in fact , we predict the lowest @xmath0 state is 6150 mev , which is much higher than the @xmath17 and @xmath93 thresholds . due to the large phase space , the predicted tetraquark states may fall apart immediately .",
    "further studies on these tetraquark states are needed both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "[ summary ]    in this work , we study the masses of open charm and bottom tetraquark states in the diquark - antidiquark pictures using the relativized quark model proposed by godfrey and isgur .",
    "the diquark and antidiquark masses are obtained with the relativized potential , which is the half of @xmath94 interaction .",
    "then , the diquark and antidiquark are regarded as the usual antiquark and quark , respectively . the form factor , simulating the diquark ( antiquark ) internal structure , is neglected in our calculations .",
    "this assumption means the diquark is treated as point - like or the distance between diquark and antidiquark is large enough .",
    "the masses of the tetraquark states are obtained by solving the schrdinger - type equation between diquark and antidiquark .",
