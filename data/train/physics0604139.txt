    "the control of elementary interactions between atoms or molecules in the gas phase is a long term concern for researchers , namely in order to find ways towards the full control of a chemical reaction , giving the ability to choose the reaction path unambiguously from a well - defined internal state towards a desired final state . in this context ,",
    "laser cooling and trapping of atoms has opened an entirely new field of investigation , as they can be brought almost to rest , in a well - defined internal state .",
    "a spectacular example is provided by the observation of bose - einstein condensation in alkali gases @xcite , recently followed by the demonstration of quantum degeneracy in a fermionic alkali gas @xcite .",
    "slowing and cooling of molecules , despite the inherent difficulty caused by the complex internal molecular structure , represents an increasingly active research field with many achievements since the first observation of ultracold cs@xmath0 molecules by photoassociation of laser - cooled cesium atoms @xcite .",
    "two approaches have been proven to be very efficient , namely stark deceleration @xcite and buffer gas cooling @xcite .",
    "other promising methods rely on phase space filtering of a molecular beam @xcite , on billiard - like collisions @xcite , or on a gas expansion out of a rotating nozzle @xcite .",
    "a major breakthrough has been the observation of molecular bose - einstein condensates , using magnetic field tunability of feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "also , two groups recently measured for the first time rates for collisions between ultracold cesium atoms and cesium molecules @xcite .    among the various approaches ,",
    "the photoassociation ( pa ) process is very attractive , as it starts from a pair of ultracold atoms which absorbs a photon to form an ultracold molecule in a short - lived excited electronic state @xcite .",
    "the main drawback is that the stabilization of the excited molecule into stable electronic states hardly provides an ensemble of molecules in a well - defined internal state , as it relies on spontaneous emission which populates many vibrational levels .",
    "some attempts to use stimulated emission have been reported @xcite , but they were limited to the transition into high - lying levels . indeed , due to the poor spatial overlap of the wave function of the photoassociated level ",
    "predominant at large interatomic distances  with the wave function of the lowest vibrational levels of the stabilized molecules , it is very difficult to create a significant proportion of ultracold molecules in their absolute ground state .",
    "a first indication of the possibility to form ultracold molecules in their absolute ground state has been provided in  @xcite for k@xmath0 molecules using a two - step photoassociation process .",
    "very recently , a multistep excitation / deexcitation scheme has been set up to produce a fair amount of rbcs ultracold molecules in the @xmath4 level of the electronic ground state @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe a possible way to fill these objectives , in the particular case of the formation of ultracold cs@xmath0 molecules , using a single - step excitation scheme .",
    "it results from the cooperative action of photoassociation at large distances , tunneling and resonant spin - orbit coupling at short distances , and final stabilization by spontaneous decay towards a few low - lying vibrational levels of a stable molecular state .",
    "we first invoked such a process for the interpretation of so - called `` giant lines '' observed in photoassociation spectra in  @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper  i. one of us also performed a time - dependent analysis of the tunneling process in such ultracold conditions , helpful for the determination of the characteristic times of the tunneling motion @xcite . from the present calculations involving the available extensive photoassociative spectroscopy of cs@xmath0",
    ", we demonstrate that the ultracold molecules are created with a very narrow distribution of vibrational levels , peaking at @xmath2 of the theoretical potential curve of the cs@xmath0 metastable triplet state .",
    "this could be the first example of the formation of ultracold molecules left mainly in a single deep vibrational level via single - photon pa .",
    "the possibility to use this mechanism to create the initial state of cesium dimers in ultracold collisions with cesium atoms has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we present our calculation of the photoassociation rate , of the cold molecule formation rate , and of the molecular ion signal resulting from the photoionization of the stabilized cold molecules .",
    "this emphasizes the role of the detection process in the interpretation of the strong intensity of these giant lines observed in the photoassociation spectrum .",
    "we start in section  [ sec : facts ] by recalling the main facts concerning the tunneling effects in the photoassociation of cs@xmath0 .",
    "we then present the model used to calculate the molecule formation rates ( section  [ sec : model ] ) , followed by the results of the simulations for the cs@xmath5 ionization signals ( section  [ sec : results ] ) . finally , concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "we briefly recall below the main results of paper  i. the pa process between two ultracold cesium atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , shown in figure  [ fig : pots0 g ] , is written as @xmath6 the pair of cold cesium atoms absorbs a photon detuned by @xmath7 to the red of the d2 atomic transition frequency @xmath8 , to populate rovibrational levels of the external well of the double - well - shaped @xmath9 molecular state correlated to the @xmath10 dissociation limit ( hereafter labeled @xmath11 ) .",
    "these levels are detected by two well - established methods : first through the fluorescence variations of the atomic trap induced by their spontaneous decay towards bound levels or towards the dissociation continuum of the lowest @xmath12 state , second through the resonant two - photon ionization ( r2pi ) of the ultracold molecules formed in this metastable triplet state into cs@xmath5 molecular ions .",
    "the latter method delivers a very neat spectrum with excellent signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "typical experimental conditions are temperatures between 20 and @xmath13 , a mean atomic density of about @xmath14 with a peak density of @xmath15 , the number of atoms being estimated between 2 to @xmath16 atoms , and intensities of 50 up to 500  w/@xmath17 for the the photoassociation laser  @xcite . the full r2pi spectrum for the @xmath11 has been analyzed in  @xcite , yielding a very precise determination of the corresponding potential curve through the rydberg - klein - rees ( rkr ) analysis , and through an approach based on the asymptotic modeling of the atom - atom interactions @xcite .",
    "vibrational levels from @xmath18 to @xmath19 have been identified @xcite in the @xmath11 outer well , with a rotational structure ( up to @xmath20 ) clearly visible up to @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , two intense structures with a large rotational splitting ( hereafter referred to as `` giant lines '' , following paper  i , and labeled g@xmath22 and g@xmath0 ) are superimposed on lines associated with levels of the @xmath9 external well ( figure [ fig : pots0 g ] ) .",
    "the most intense line within the g@xmath22 ( g@xmath0 ) feature was assigned to @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) at @xmath25  @xmath26 ( @xmath27  @xmath26 ) superimposed on @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , while weak lines assigned up to @xmath30 were detected providing a rotational constant @xmath31  mhz ( @xmath32  mhz ) .",
    "excited molecule to the metastable @xmath12 state .",
    "the @xmath11 state is coupled to the @xmath33 via spin - orbit interaction .",
    "vibrational levels involved in the tunneling through the @xmath11 barrier , as well as the deep @xmath34 vibrational levels which can be reached by spontaneous decay are pictured with lines ( not to scale ) .",
    "the recorded experimental spectrum is recalled in the two insets , for both the g@xmath22 and g@xmath0 features , showing their large rotational structure , and the neighboring levels @xmath35 of the @xmath11 external well . ]    with the help of a coupled - channel model , the g@xmath22 and g@xmath0 features have been assigned in paper  i to levels which tunnel through the potential barrier between the two wells of the @xmath11 state , as schematized in figure  [ fig : pots0 g ] .",
    "their large rotational structure is induced by the vibrational motion in two coupled vibrational levels of the @xmath11 internal well , which is coupled to several levels in the external well ( only two of them are drawn in figure  [ fig : pots0 g ] for better clarity ) .",
    "the tunneling effect , unusual for a heavy molecule like cs@xmath0 , is then an efficient mechanism to transfer the vibrational motion of the photoassociated state from large interatomic distances towards the inner zone : in contrast with the long - range molecular states usually reached by pa , spontaneous emission of the tunneling levels can stabilize the photoassociated molecules into low vibrational levels of the @xmath34 metastable state , creating then ultracold molecules with a rather cold vibrational motion .",
    "let us note that the internal state of the molecules created has not been probed experimentally yet .",
    "the @xmath11 outer well is represented by the asymptotic model of  @xcite . as there is no available spectroscopic determination of the @xmath11 inner well , this external well is matched to the curve computed by spies and meyer  @xcite , through a potential barrier whose height and position have been adjusted in paper  i in order to reproduce the experimental observations .",
    "the potential barrier then culminates at 2  @xmath26 above the @xmath36 dissociation limit .",
    "furthermore , according to  @xcite , the @xmath11 state is coupled in the inner well region to the next @xmath37 state ( hereafter labeled @xmath33 ) through a non - adiabatic coupling generated by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath33 curves then exhibit a well - localized avoided crossing around @xmath38 , which we transformed into a real crossing by linearizing the curves around the crossing to determine the corresponding standard landau - zener coupling parameters .",
    "we imposed a finite range for the coupling using the gaussian form @xmath39 $ ] with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( all in atomic units ) .",
    "we recall that the absence of resonant coupling between levels of the internal wells would result to a single tunneling level , instead of the two levels assigned in the experiment  @xcite .    for each value of @xmath43 ,",
    "the radial schrdinger equation is solved with the mapped fourier grid hamiltonian ( mfgh ) method  @xcite , providing accurate vibrational energies @xmath44 , wave functions @xmath45 , and rotational constants @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 is the cs@xmath0 reduced mass ) of the two coupled state .",
    "it is well known that tunneling through a potential barrier is very sensitive to its shape and to the position in energy with respect to the top of the barrier .",
    "these effects are magnified here as the two tunneling levels of the @xmath11 and @xmath33 internal wells , hereafter referred to as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively , interact resonantly with the dense  but not continuous  energy level spectrum of the external well .",
    "our calculations predict that the tunneling effect will be observable in the detection signal if the tunneling probability is maximum , which is achieved by adjusting the relative position of the two internal wells to create an almost half - and - half mixing of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 radial wave functions .",
    "our model actually presents many tunable parameters for such an adjustment : indeed , the internal well of the potentials , as well as their coupling , are unknown experimentally , so that their fine tuning is quite tedious .",
    "we also noted that the tunneling effect is very sensitive to the value of @xmath43 . in order to facilitate the convergence",
    ", we stopped the adjustment when we found maximal tunneling for an arbitrary @xmath43 value .",
    "in other words , we also considered the rotational number @xmath43 as a tunable parameter , which we will label as @xmath50 in the following .",
    "an example of the resulting wave functions is shown in figure  [ fig : wfg2j05 ] ) , where the maximal tunneling effect is found for the value @xmath51 .",
    "this is clearly not in agreement with the rotational quantum number of the experiment , but we only need _ radial _ wave functions for the rate calculations of the next section , which will be evaluated without any @xmath43 dependence .",
    "the corresponding numerical data is available on request from the authors .",
    "( panels b - e ) associated with the radial motion in the @xmath11 double well ( in black ) and in the @xmath33 well ( in red ) .",
    "the corresponding potentials are drawn with full black and dashed red lines , respectively , to make more visible the extension of the wave functions within the corresponding potentials .",
    "the @xmath51 value ( panels b and c ) allows maximal tunneling for the g@xmath0 resonance at @xmath52  @xmath26 , almost degenerate with a level of the external well at @xmath53  @xmath26 : the wave functions have significant amplitude over the barrier range . the @xmath54 case ( panels d and e )",
    "is also shown for comparison : the energy matching is less favorable and the wave functions hardly penetrate the potential barrier .",
    "panel ( a ) displays a typical radial wave function of the initial collisional state for a temperature of @xmath55 , in the @xmath12 state , designed here with a scattering length of about @xmath56 . ]",
    "even if in the adjustment procedure above we used @xmath50 as a parameter , figure  [ bvj.eps ] shows that the selectivity of the tunneling process is very strongly dependent on the rotational level .",
    "the value of @xmath57 defined above is very sensitive to the repartition of the wave function inside the two wells , and panel ( a ) in figure  [ bvj.eps ] reflects the pattern shown in figure  [ fig : wfg2j05 ] , where the value for @xmath51 is intermediate between the rotational constant of levels in the internal well ( @xmath58  @xmath26 ) and of levels of the external well ( @xmath59  @xmath26 ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath60 line for g@xmath22 also reflects the extension of the wave function over both wells .",
    "the @xmath51 line displays the same behavior , which can be understood since the rotational structure of g@xmath22 has the same magnitude as the energy spacing between vibrational levels of the external well , so that it is resonant with @xmath61 in our calculations .",
    "this aspect was not present in the model we set up in paper  i and confirms what is observed experimentally .",
    "indeed , due to the ultracold temperature , the s - wave regime is expected to dominate the initial collision between the two cs atoms ( yielding @xmath62 ) with probably a small contribution of the p wave ( yielding @xmath63 ) .",
    "the presence of higher values of @xmath43 at such low temperatures is not yet fully understood  @xcite .",
    "the relative intensities of the @xmath64 experimental lines approximately reflects their @xmath65 degeneracy , and the @xmath66 line has indeed the strongest intensity for most of the pa lines assigned to the levels of the @xmath11 external well .",
    "the lines with larger @xmath43 values are weaker , due to the small contribution of higher partial waves involved in the collision .",
    "we see that this hierarchy is not preserved for g@xmath22 and g@xmath0 : the intense lines are associated with those rotational levels which are indeed resonant with a level of the internal well , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath67 , respectively .     for rovibrational levels of the coupled @xmath68 and @xmath37 potentials , as function of their binding energy .",

    "are marked by arrows . ]",
    "the metastable @xmath12 state is represented by the potential curve of  @xcite , matched beyond @xmath69 to the standard asymptotic expansion @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , with @xmath72 coefficients taken from  @xcite .",
    "the repulsive wall of the potential is slightly changed in order to reproduce a large and positive scattering length  @xcite .",
    "we work here with @xmath73 , which satisfactorily reproduces the intensity envelope of the pa spectrum of  @xcite .",
    "the initial scattering radial wave function is computed through a standard numerov integration at an energy @xmath74 above the @xmath75 asymptote , ignoring the hyperfine structure ( figure  [ fig : wfg2j05]a ) .",
    "let us note that the accuracy of the @xmath76 and @xmath72 values is not crucial for the following calculation of the rates , which can be determined experimentally typically within a factor of 2 .",
    "the photoassociation and cold molecule formation rates are evaluated according to the perturbative model already presented in previous papers  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the photoassociation rate @xmath77 per atom ( expressed in s@xmath78 ) for an initial continuum state with energy @xmath79 and wave function @xmath80 into a vibrational level @xmath81 with a radial wave function @xmath82 of the coupled @xmath9 states ( where @xmath81 stands for the quantum number @xmath83 of the @xmath11 external well levels , or for g@xmath22 or g@xmath0 ) , at a detuning @xmath84 below @xmath36 limit is expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the atomic density and @xmath87 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",

    "as expected , g@xmath22 and g@xmath0 have smaller overlap with the initial continuum than the external well levels , due to the weaker probability of wave functions to be localized at large distances .",
