    "the values for @xmath23 are the object of this note , and reveal that the picture changes radically :    the non - trivial homology groups @xmath24 occur for @xmath25 and are all @xmath26-dimensional .",

    "computing modulo a prime can only reduce the rank ; so that the values @xmath77 we obtained are underestimates of the actual ranks of @xmath82 .",
    "however , we also know _ a priori _ that @xmath83 since it is the dimension of a vector space ; and none of the @xmath77 we computed can be increased without at the same time causing a homology dimension to become negative , so our reduction modulo a prime is legal .    for information , the parameters @xmath84 for @xmath23 are as follows : @xmath85    the largest single matrix operations that had to be performed were computing the nullspace of a @xmath86 matrix ( 16 cpu hours ) and the rank modulo @xmath81 of a ( less sparse ) @xmath87 matrix ( 10 cpu hours ) .",

    "it may be possible , however , to arrive at a reasonable understanding of the non - trivial class in degree @xmath89 .",
