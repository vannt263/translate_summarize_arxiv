    "<S> the dependence of the landau gauge gluon and ghost propagators on the choice of gribov copies is studied in pure @xmath0 lattice gauge theory . whereas the influence on the gluon propagator is small , the ghost propagator becomes clearly affected by the copies in the infrared region . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our data with the infrared exponents predicted by the dyson - schwinger equation approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - perturbative behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators in yang - mills theories is of interest for the understanding of the mechanism of confinement of gluons and quarks . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the infrared behaviour of the ghost propagator in the landau gauge is related to the so - called kugo - ojima confinement criterion  @xcite , which expresses the absence of coloured massless asymptotic states from the spectrum of physical states in terms of the ghost propagator at vanishing momentum . on the other hand the suppression of the gluon propagator in the infrared </S>",
    "<S> was argued to be related to the gluon confinement  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> zwanziger  @xcite has suggested that the behaviour of both propagators in landau gauge results from the restriction of the gauge fields to the gribov region , where the faddeev - popov operator is non - negative . </S>",
    "<S> generically , one gauge orbit has more than one intersection ( gribov copies ) within the gribov region . in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> we assess the importance of this ambiguity for the ghost and gluon propagator in @xmath0 gauge theory on a finite lattice .    in the continuum </S>",
    "<S> the gluon and ghost propagators have been computed from a coupled and truncated set of dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations  @xcite . representing the gluon and ghost propagators in the landau gauge as @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the low - momentum behaviour of the corresponding dressing functions was found to be closely constrained by the respective infrared exponents , @xmath2 with @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been only a few numerical lattice investigations of the @xmath0 ghost propagator in the past  @xcite contrary to the gluon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> here we present data for both propagators in landau gauge measured at the same ensemble of @xmath0 gauge - fixed configurations and concentrate on the infrared behaviour inside the gribov region . </S>",
    "<S> the strategy of the investigation is similar to a previous analysis of the @xmath4 ghost propagator @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the landau gauge condition is implemented by searching for a gauge transformation @xmath5 which maximises the gauge functional @xmath6 \\propto   \\sum_{x,\\mu}{\\mathfrak{re}\\,}{\\mbox{tr}}\\:{}^{g}u_{x,\\mu}$ ] where the gauge field @xmath7 is provided by monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this functional has many local extrema whose number increases with the lattice size and decreasing @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> all gribov copies @xmath9 belong to the gauge orbit created by @xmath10 and satisfy the lattice landau gauge condition @xmath11 with @xmath12    before investigating the infrared behaviour of both propagators we first check the influence of different ways to select gribov copies on the average propagators taken at some low momenta .    </S>",
    "<S> as it was previously found the gribov copy ambiguity affects the measurements of the ghost propagator in the case of @xmath4 @xcite . also from a recent study the @xmath0 gluon propagator </S>",
    "<S> is seen to depend systematically on the choice of gribov copies  @xcite contrary to common belief .    </S>",
    "<S> we report on first measurements on @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattices at @xmath15 , 6.0 , and 6.2 as well as @xmath16 at @xmath15 . in the update </S>",
    "<S> the usual heatbath algorithm with microcanonical overrelaxation steps is used . </S>",
    "<S> then for each configuration @xmath17 random copies on a @xmath13 lattice ( @xmath18 on @xmath14 and @xmath19 on @xmath16 ) have been gauge - fixed using the standard overrelaxation method until @xmath20 has been reached .    </S>",
    "<S> the propagators were evaluated on the first ( fc ) and the best ( bc ) ( with respect to the gauge functional ) gauge - fixed copies . the gluon propagator was calculated for all momenta using the fast fourier transformation of the gauge potentials  ( [ eq : vectorpot ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ghost propagator was obtained using the conjugate gradient method with a plane wave source only for the lowest non - vanishing momenta . </S>",
    "<S> for each momentum squared , , the final propagator is an average over the respective ensemble of gauge - fixed copies ( fc ) or ( bc ) and over different @xmath21 giving rise to the same @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , only momenta with @xmath21 satisfying @xmath23 have been used in the analysis of the gluon propagator .    </S>",
    "<S> the results from a @xmath14 lattice at the chosen values of @xmath24 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gh_and_gl_as_func_of_beta ] for some lowest momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the ghost propagator is clearly affected by the gribov copy problem . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is bigger than the statistical error and increases with decreasing momenta . on the other hand , for the lowest momentum of the gluon propagator </S>",
    "<S> the impact of gribov copies is completely below the statistical error . for other momenta </S>",
    "<S> there are some effects visible as shown in the lower half of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gh_and_gl_as_func_of_q ]    the upper half of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gh_and_gl_as_func_of_q ] shows both propagators for the best copy as a function of the momentum @xmath25 scaled with an appropriate lattice spacing @xmath26 . in order to compare to other studies  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath27 , 1.885 and 2.637 gev for @xmath15 , 6.0 and 6.2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lower half shows the ratio between the mean value on the first and best copy of the respective propagators dressing function , @xmath28 . due to the low number @xmath29 of gauge copies </S>",
    "<S> such ratios on a @xmath16 lattice are not shown there . </S>",
    "<S> for the lowest momenta the ghost propagator is systematically overestimated if measured on an arbitrary ( first ) gauge copy , while for the gluon propagator the statistical noise is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far we have only measured the ghost propagator for a single @xmath21 without permutations of components .    as in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we also found outliers in the data of the ghost propagator at the lowest momenta @xmath30 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ghost_hist ] , which may make statistical analyses difficult , if arbitrary ( first ) gauge copies are studied only . however , the reason is unknown yet .    to parametrise the infrared behaviour , we fitted the measured dressing function in the form @xmath31 and @xmath32 with common @xmath33 to the data at some low @xmath25 values . </S>",
    "<S> for the best fit with @xmath34 we found @xmath35 for the best copy , far away from the ds prediction </S>",
    "<S> . however , despite @xmath33 tends to increase as @xmath36 decrease a reasonable statement can not be made from the lattice sizes @xmath37 used .    in summary , we have reported first results studying the influence of the @xmath0 ghost and gluon propagators on gribov copies . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the ghost propagator is more affected than the gluon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the ghost propagator on an arbitrary first gauge - fixed configuration the propagator is systematically overestimated , the effect is largest for the lowest momenta . on the other side </S>",
    "<S> there is an irregular impact on the gluon propagator . concerning the infrared behaviour </S>",
    "<S> the results from the lattice sizes used so far do not allow to confirm the proposed scaling behaviour using the ansatz discussed with an infrared exponent @xmath38 simultaneously describing both propagators .     vs.  the first ( fc ) and best ( bc ) gauge copy on a @xmath14 lattice . </S>",
