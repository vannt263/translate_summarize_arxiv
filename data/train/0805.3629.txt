    "<S> we report on a complete free - space field implementation of a modified ekert91 protocol for quantum key distribution using entangled photon pairs . for each photon pair </S>",
    "<S> we perform a random choice between key generation and a bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of violation is used to determine the possible knowledge of an eavesdropper to ensure security of the distributed final key .    </S>",
    "<S> proposals for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) were first published over two decades ago @xcite . in particular , the protocol of bennett and brassard in 1984 ( bb84 ) sought to distribute a random encryption key via correlated polarization states of single photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its strength was derived from the no - cloning theorem @xcite which states that the state of a single quantum system can not be copied perfectly . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement attempt on the distributed key is revealed as errors in the expected correlation of the measurement results . </S>",
    "<S> bb84 must treat all noise as evidence of an eavesdropper . whether a completely secure key can then be distilled after error correction @xcite depends only on the fraction of errors in the initial key .    </S>",
    "<S> the ` quantum ' nature of qkd was explored from a different angle in 1991 when ekert proposed an implementation using non - local correlations between maximally entangled photon - pairs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of entanglement between a photon - pair can be measured by the degree of violation of a bell inequality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> maximally entangled photon - pairs have perfect correlations in their polarization states , and violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) version @xcite of this inequality with the maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> the defining feature in ekert91 is the suggestion to use the degree of violation of the chsh inequality as a test of security . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is related to the concept later known as the monogamy of entanglement @xcite : the entanglement between two systems decreases when a third system ( for example , the measurement apparatus of an eavesdropper ) interacts with the pair .    </S>",
    "<S> although bb84 and ekert91 utilize different aspects of quantum mechanics , once one writes down explicitly the expected qubit states and the measurements that should be performed , the two protocols turn out to generate the same set of correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when these calculations were extended to include error correction and privacy amplification , a quantitative link was found between eve s information ( assuming individual attacks ) and the amount of violation of the chsh inequality @xcite , thus vindicating ekert s intuition . bb84 and ekert91 came to be considered as fully equivalent . in this perspective , the choice between a prepare - and - measure and an entanglement - based implementation is dictated only by a balance of practical benefits . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , bb84 involves an active choice when encoding the logical bits 0 and 1 into the polarization states , requiring a trusted high - bandwidth random number source @xcite ; in comparison , no active choice is necessary with entanglement - based qkd . besides its ability to remove the need for random number generators @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> technical difficulties related to the lack of practical true single photon sources can be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> the price of entanglement - based qkd is a lower key generation rate due to the limited brightness of contemporary entangled photon - pair sources when compared with faint coherent pulse approximations of single photon sources .    </S>",
    "<S> recently two theoretical developments pointed to the fact that bb84 and ekert91 may not be equivalent after all . </S>",
    "<S> the first such development are the proofs of unconditional security developed by koashi and preskill @xcite and improved by ma , fung and lo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors proved that the security of entanglement - based implementations can be based on the sole knowledge of the error rate , because this quantity already contains information about the imperfection of the source  while such imperfections ( e.g. the photon - number statistics , or spectral distinguishability of different letters @xcite ) must be carefully taken into account in prepare - and - measure schemes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second development is due to acn and coworkers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors went back to ekert s original idea of basing the security _ only _ on the combined correlation function @xmath0 for violating chsh and derived the formula @xmath1 with the binary entropy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this formula provides an unconditional security bound under the same assumptions as in @xcite ; it also guarantees partial security in a more paranoid scenario , in which the qkd devices are untrusted ( we shall come back to this issue in the conclusions ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we describe an entanglement - based qkd experiment in which we monitor the violation of the chsh inequality and use ( [ eqacin ] ) to quantify the degree of raw key compression in the privacy amplification step . </S>",
    "<S> typically , implementations of entanglement - based qkd systems do not monitor bell inequalities @xcite ; in one of the first experiments @xcite , a bell - type inequality was monitored , but no quantitative measure of security was derived from the observed violation .        </S>",
    "<S> _ experiment . </S>",
    "<S> _ we implement a modified ekert91 protocol @xcite that uses a minimal combination of three detection settings @xmath3 on one side , and two distinct detection settings @xmath4 on the other side for performing polarization measurements on a photon - pair in a singlet state @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the setting pair @xmath6 corresponds to horizontal / vertical polarization , and should lead ( in the absence of noise ) to perfectly anti - correlated measurement results which form the raw key . </S>",
    "<S> the setting @xmath7 and the other ones are used to check the violation of the chsh inequality @xmath8 with @xmath9 the correlation coefficients @xmath10 are determined from the number @xmath11 of coincidence events between detectors @xmath12 on one side and @xmath13 on the other side , collected during a given integration time @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> measurement bases are chosen such that a maximal value of @xmath15 would be expected . </S>",
    "<S> basis @xmath16 is chosen to correspond to @xmath17 linear polarization , and bases @xmath18 need to form an orthogonal set corresponding to @xmath19 linear polarizations ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : arrows ] ) . with that , we evaluate for example @xmath20 and the other coefficients in ( [ eq : bell ] ) accordingly from an ensemble of pair detection events .        </S>",
    "<S> the random choice of measurement bases is performed with a combination of polarization - independent beam splitters ( b1-b3 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ) , with a 50:50 splitting ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this avoids an explicit generation of a random number by a device . </S>",
    "<S> the base settings corresponding to the angles shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : arrows ] are adjusted by appropriately oriented half wave plates ( h1-h3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining elements of the experimental setup are similar to a previous experiment implementing an entanglement - based bb84 protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> polarization - entangled photon pairs are generated in a compact diode - laser pumped non - collinear type - ii parametric down conversion process @xcite with efficient collection techniques into single mode optical fibers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we pump a 2 mm thick @xmath21-barium borate ( bbo ) crystal at a wavelength of 407 nm with a power of 40mw and observe a photo coincidence rate of about 18000s@xmath22 in passively - quenched silicon avalanche photodiodes directly at the source . </S>",
    "<S> we separate the two measurement devices by @xmath23 km in an urban environment , introducing a link loss of about 3db caused primarily by atmospheric absorption at the down converted wavelength of 810 nm and transmission fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> background light suppression ( at night ) was accomplished using a spatial filter ( ph ) in the receiving telescope ( acceptance range @xmath24sr ) and a color glass filter ( rg780 ) with a peak transmission of @xmath25 for the down - converted light at 810 nm .    </S>",
    "<S> correlated photons are identified by recording their time of arrival at each detector and running a cross correlation of the timing information on both sides ( similar to the scheme in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the virtual coincidence window defined in software was 3.75ns , and we monitored the accidental coincidences in an equally wide time window offset by 20ns . detector time delay compensation was adjusted to better than 0.5ns to avoid leakage through a classical timing channel @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results from one 9.5 hour run are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expresult ] . in this interval </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a small drop of the coincidence rate due to an alignment drift in the optical link . </S>",
    "<S> accidental coincidences were about 0.5% of the coincidences from down - converted photon pairs .    </S>",
    "<S> half of the identified photon pairs were seen by detectors ( 3,4,5,6 ) paired with ( 1,2,3,4 ) , which were used to evaluate the violation of ( [ eq : bell ] ) . about a quarter of the pairs in detector combinations ( 1,2 ) with ( 1,2 ) </S>",
    "<S> contributed to the raw key , while the residual quarter of pairs in combinations ( 1,2 ) with ( 3,4 ) were discarded . </S>",
    "<S> detectors ( 1,2,1,2 ) were adjusted to coincide with the natural axes of the down conversion crystal to keep the error rate on the raw key as small as possible .    </S>",
    "<S> error correction following a modified cascade protocol  @xcite was performed in real time on packets of at least 10000 raw bits for a targeted final bit error ratio of @xmath26 . the corresponding quantum bit error ratio ( qber ) </S>",
    "<S> was extracted out of this procedure ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expresult]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the combined correlation value @xmath0 was extracted via ( [ eq : corrcoeff ] ) for that block of raw key , and stayed at around 2.5 over the whole measurement time ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expresult]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a particularly high value , and we suspect a broad optical spectrum in the blue pump diode as a reason for this problem . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with lower polarization correlation in the @xmath17 basis due to a residual distinguishability between the two decay paths in the spdc process . </S>",
    "<S> however , it serves as a typical model for an eavesdropping attempt e.g. by a partial intercept - resend attack in the h / v basis . </S>",
    "<S> while such an attack is not revealed in the qber in this protocol , it clearly shows in a reduction of @xmath0 from the maximally expected value of @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> the average information leakage @xmath28 per raw bit to an eavesdropper was estimated for each block following ( [ eqacin ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> together with the revealed bits in the error correction procedure ( and not assuming that any errors are due to intrinsic detector noise ) , we can then establish the secret key fraction alice and bob can extract out of the privacy amplification hashing procedure from a given raw key block . </S>",
    "<S> the result over time is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : expresult]d , resulting in an average final key rate of around 300bits@xmath22 or about @xmath29bit of error - free secret key .    </S>",
    "<S> the estimation of the eavesdropper knowledge is applicable strictly only for an infinitely large number of bits ; recent work on the security of finite length keys implies that the privacy amplification should be carried out over large ensembles @xcite . for the protocol studied here , </S>",
    "<S> a finite - key bound has been presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . by performing privacy amplification on blocks of @xmath30 bits of the raw key </S>",
    "<S> , the extractable secure key is around half of the asymptotic value . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 that is not fulfilled in the experiment and ( ii ) the optimization of the probability of the measurements as a function of @xmath31 , while in the experiment the choices are always made by 50:50 splitters . </S>",
    "<S> ]    _ conclusion and perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> _ we have demonstrated a free space implementation of a modified ekert91 protocol . </S>",
    "<S> the security of the key distilled was derived from the violation of the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> this ensured that the key was distributed not by some arbitrary random number generator , but with the non - local correlations shared by entangled photon - pairs .    </S>",
    "<S> using ekert91 , the authorized parties can give up control over the photon source . </S>",
    "<S> acn et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that the chsh violation is in principle sufficient to decide the security ( against collective attacks ) of a distributed key , even if the measurement apparatus is not trusted . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , such a scheme is not yet experimentally feasible because of the stringent requirement it places on detector efficiencies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a final point must be made about the random choice generator . </S>",
    "<S> our implementation leaves this choice to the beam splitter b1 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] , which is accessible from the quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> we are then assuming that the eavesdropper can not change the beam splitter s behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable ; however , it makes our setup fall outside the device - independent scenario , even in the lossless regime . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in that scenario , one can construct a situation in which bb84 would not be secure at all @xcite because it is conceivable that different states are sent to the different measurement devices ; but this is excluded for a well - behaved beam - splitter , which is precisely our assumption . </S>",
    "<S> device - independent security requires the choice to be made on degrees of freedom independent of those accessible to the eavesdropper . </S>"
