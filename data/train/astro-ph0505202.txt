    "while the structure of space - time is governed by the field equations the physical properties of matter , introduced via energy - momentum tensor , is take from other parts of physics .",
    "mathematically , one proceeds in an analogous way to that adopted by newton who defined a dual geometric - physical concept of mass - point . in general relativity",
    "one defines particles as curves in space - time and ascribes to them physical quantities such as density and pressure .",
    "the @xmath7 of the rest - mass @xmath8 is defined as a future directed curve @xmath9 in a space - time @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 .",
    "the tangent vector @xmath12 is the energy - momentum vector of the particle .",
    "then , a particle flow of rest - mass @xmath8 is defined to be a pair @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a function @xmath15 called the world density , and @xmath16 is the energy - momentum vector field @xmath17 such that each integral curve of @xmath16 is a particle of rest - mass @xmath8 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of particle flow @xmath13 is tensor @xmath18 ; and pressure @xmath19 , understood as a function of @xmath10 , enters it through @xmath16 ( for detailed formalism see @xcite ) .",
    "mc crea @xcite noticed many years ago that since matter is taken from outside of general relativity , there are no a priori reasons why @xmath19 should be non  negative .",
    "the only way how @xmath19 should be interpreted is through effects which it produces in a model .",
    "for example , @xmath20 may be interpreted as a quintessence matter @xcite or dark energy due to the present universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "lie groups of symmetry play an important role in searching for new solutions but their original field of fruitful applications remained hidden in the literature .",
    "this problem was discussed by stephani @xcite in his introduction to the basic monograph on the application of symmetry groups to general relativity . but",
    "this method is still obscure because many people who used them implicitly simply were not aware of their existence @xcite .",
    "the equation of state also plays an important role in general relativity . as it is well known , einstein s field equations , together with the bianchi identities , form an undetermined system of equations and one more equation , equation of state must be added .",
    "einstein s equations completed by the equation of state satisfy certain symmetries which has structure of a group , called a symmetry group ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting that this procedure can be reversed @xcite .",
    "collins applied the method of deriving form of the equation of state from symmetry to the case of classical and relativistic stars to obtain the physically realistic equations of state @xcite .",
    "this illustrate  to use collin s expressions  a subliminal role of mathematics in physical considerations which consists in suggesting correct physics on the ground of a logical beauty ( such as , for example , symmetry principles ) .",
    "there are several interesting papers where the authors study symmetry transformations under which the einstein equation are invariant .",
    "they relate symmetry and inflation @xcite however the lie group of symmetries is not used in analysis of the frw equation .",
    "the investigation of lie symmetries of general relativity and cosmology and the origin of dynamical systems in the context of casual viscous fluid and the cosmology with variable constants can also be found interesting . for a cosmological models with bulk viscosity idea of renormalisation group",
    "is also presented to study some scaling properties of the model @xcite .    because the einstein equation constitute very complicated system of nonlinear partial differential equation it is not easy to obtain an exact solution .",
    "however , one can assume self - similarity symmetry and then due to this simplified assumption einstein field equation with spherical symmetry can be reduced to the form ordinary differential equations i.e. a dynamical system .",
    "therefore the assumption of self - similarity symetry is very useful in the problem of finding exact solutions in nonhomogeneous case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the self - similar solutions play especially important roles in the cosmological applications or description of gravitational collapse .",
    "it is the consequence of the fact that they describe asymptotic behaviour of more general solutions .",
    "the idea that spherical symmetric fluctuations might naturally evolve toward self - similar form is known as as the similarity hypothesis @xcite .",
    "a very interesting result was founded by harada and maeda @xcite .",
    "they proved numerically that self - similar solution acts as an attractor in the phase space for spherically symmetric collapse of perfect fluid . in the context of gravitational collapse",
    "self - similar solution has been also studied from the points of view of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the self - similar solutions also play an important role in the contemporary context of dark energy .",
    "the scaling solutions in the context of `` cosmic coincidence conundrum '' were also considered in @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated in many papers that there exists a stationary scaling solution in this problem which is representing a stable attractor at late times @xcite . among the class of solutions ,",
    "the global atractor solutions are of the greatest interest from the physical point of view .",
    "they usually constitute scaling type of solutions which can explain why energy densities of dark energy and matter at present epoch are of the same order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "our main idea is to use the concept of self - similarity to the derivation of the form of equation of state .",
    "they reproduce themselves as the scale changes .",
    "this methodology was already used by ellis and buchert in context of problem of gravitational entropy @xcite .    to determine the structure and the dynamics of astrophysical systems as well as the universe , the equation of state is usually necessary .",
    "let us consider , for example , the structure of a spherical neutron star",
    ". then if the pressure @xmath19 is known as a function of the density @xmath21 , we can determine the gravitational mass @xmath10 and the radius @xmath22 of the star as a function of the central density @xmath23 by solving the oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "this means that we can determine in principle the mass - radius relation @xmath24 theoretically .",
    "in similar way if the dependence between total pressure and total energy density of the universe is postulated then we can integrate the friedmann equation @xcite .",
    "however , the equation of state relevant to the neutron star or the universe is not established yet , although it may be determined in the near future .",
    "let us note that for the universe the form of equation of state is not theoretically known at present but from observations of snia data it may be reconstructed in the snap3 ..    in our paper the form of the equation of state is not postulated a priori but it is derived from the existence of scaling solutions .",
    "the existence of scaling solutions is equivalent the existence of a corresponding symmetry group ( similarity group ) of the basic differential equations .",
    "it is just discussed by us the type of symmetry of dynamical equations .",
    "our philosophy is to assume the existence of scaling solutions instead of postulated a priori any prescribed form of the equation of state .",
    "we use lie symmetries to determine the dependence of energy density on the scale factor .",
    "of course if we assume the exact form of the equation of state for example for phantoms then it is easy to obtain the exact form of @xmath25 for the adiabatic condition .",
    "in physical applications the important role is played by the scaling solutions , they are also called self - similar , homological etc . the physical properties of such solutions are important in many branches of physics @xcite .",
    "they can be found in the exact form or can be analysed by using the dynamical system methods .",
    "then invariants of self - similarity groups are a good choice for a variable to parameterise a system .",
    "a natural question is whether the cosmological model filled by scaling fluid is actually preferred by the data over concordance @xmath6cdm model .",
    "this problem can be investigated by using the akaike ( aic ) and bayesian ( bic ) informative criterion .",
    "we find that aic favoured frw model with scaling fluid relative to @xmath6cdm model .",
    "in the present paper we pursue collins way of thinking @xcite applying it to the field of cosmology . in section 2",
    "we outlined the theory of symmetry groups of differential equations , then we showed that cosmological equations , together with a suitable equation of state admit a certain lie group of symmetries or , vice versa , the invariance of equations with respect to a given symmetry group singles out corresponding equation of state . in sections 3 - 4 we showed this for friedmann models with matter in the form of perfect fluid and effective cosmological constant , respectively . in section 5 and 6 we confronted data obtained theoretically from symmetry equation of state with recently available snia data . in section 7",
    "we briefly commented on the obtained results .",
    "let us consider , in a euclidean space @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the system of differential equations @xmath29 and point - point transformations @xmath30 which map each solution of system ( [ eq:1 ] ) into a solution of the same system .",

    "the problem of group properties of vacuum einstein equations has been investigated by ibragimov ( 1983 ) @xcite . in this case",

    "equation  ( [ eq:6a ] ) gives us the conditions of the existence of the operator symmetry @xmath48 for the system ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "algebra of these operators characterises the symmetry of the group @xmath31 symmetry of system  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "in the following part we shall consider symmetry of autonomous dynamical systems for which @xmath67 ( a dot denotes the differentiation with respect to the parameter @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 and infinitesimal transformations are generated by @xmath70 . in this case ( [ eq:6a ] ) simplify to the form @xmath71 the friedmann equations may be written in the form of autonomous dynamical system on the plane @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a scale factor , @xmath21 energy density , @xmath75 curvature index , @xmath6 cosmological constant .",
    "the set of basic dynamical equations is called the friedmann dynamical system .",
    "if we assume that the operator of infinitesimal transformation of symmetry for system  ( [ eq:10 ] ) is of the form @xmath76 then equations ( [ eq:10a ] ) can be reduced to @xmath77 let us concentrate now ( without lose of degree of generalisation ) on the special case of the frw , namely the flat model without cosmological constant .",
    "then equations  ( [ eq:10 ] ) reduces to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is redefined energy density , @xmath19 is a pressure as an unknown function of scale factor . let us assume that equations ( [ eq:11 ] ) admit the special symmetry of the operator for quasi - homology , i.e .",

    "the condition for the existence of quasi - homological type of symmetry reduces to corresponding condition for existence of homological symmetry and then @xmath19 must satisfy ( [ eq:15 ] ) .",

    "( [ eq:17 ] ) , then mentioned before special cases of @xmath19 can be simply recovered . therefore eq .  ( [ eq:17 ] ) gives the most general form of the equation of state for the universe to be self invariant or homological . in this case",
    "we can find a strict analogy to stars @xcite .",
    "one should notice that the formulae ( [ eq:17 ] ) contains for example the following form of the equation of state @xmath100 which is crucial for our further investigations .",
    "we can find that eq .",
    "( [ eq:18 ] ) describes the pressure of noninteracting multifluids components .",
    "then from the conservation condition postulating for each component we obtain @xmath101 , where @xmath6 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 are constants .",
    "note that in the special case of @xmath105 equation ( [ eq:18 ] ) and conservation condition give rise to new type of contribution @xmath106 instead @xmath107 .",
    "it corresponds to mond phase squeezing in frw scenario @xcite . to obtain the form of equation of state ( [ eq:18 ] ) it is sufficiently to choose @xmath108 .",
    "then from equations  ( [ eq:13 ] ) the finite transformations can be simply obtain for this case , namely @xmath109 one can check that the invariant @xmath110 is really preserved under the action of the homological transformation , i.e. @xmath111 the equation of state given by  ( [ eq:17 ] ) assumes very general form . their existence can be closely associated with the real equation of state for quintessence matter .",
    "let us note that equation  ( [ eq:18 ] ) contains not only standard term of the equation of state @xmath112 , but also the cosmological constant with a constant part and a part depending on the scale factor @xmath74 .",
    "in the special case if @xmath113 we recover the form of the effective cosmological constant distinguished by a maximum of the amplitude for the tunnelling gamov process @xcite . in the general case in the parameterisation of the cosmological term",
    "it is usually assumed the power law form of @xmath114 dependence which is also suggested from symmetry consideration @xcite .",
    "note that homological transformations are strictly related to dimensional analysis .",
    "the existence of such kind symmetry means that equation can be simply expressed in the dimensionless form .",
    "therefore for each component of the fluid one can define dimensionless density parameters which contain basic friedmann equation .",
    "in this section we confront frw cosmological model filled with homological fluid ( which equation of state was previously suggested from symmetry arguments ) with observations of distant supernovae type ia .",
    "these interpreted observations in the framework frw model indicate that our universe is presently accelerating due to unknown form of matter called dark energy with negative pressure @xcite.there are different candidates for dark energy which was tested from snia observations @xcite    the most popular candidate is cosmological constant which can be treated as a perfect fluid for which @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "although cosmological constant explains observations of snia we do nt understand why the observed value of cosmological constant ( @xmath117 ) is so small in comparison with its natural theoretical expectations from quantum field theory @xmath118 . according to this theory ,",
    "the energy  momentum tensor of the vacuum is nonvanishing and @xmath119 .",
    "therefore the observed cosmological constant term is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the `` bare '' cosmological constant .",

    "the variable @xmath6 models ( or a decaying vacuum energy density ) are described in terms of two fluids mixture just like it was predicted from similarity analysis . in the majority of the paper s calculations",
    "@xmath127 depends only on the cosmological time through the scale factor @xmath128 .",
    "the expression @xmath129 is obtained by using dimensional arguments made in the spirit of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "we assume that we have a decaying vacuum medium parameterised by scale factor in the power of law plus a noninteracting cosmological constant term @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , we usually have baryonic matter satisfying the equation of state @xmath130 .",
    "hence the frw equation in general case can be rearranged to the form giving the hubble function @xmath131    @xmath132    for @xmath133 ( the present value of scale factor ) we obtain the following constraint @xmath134    because of the constraint @xmath135 the space admissible for the motion should be restricted to the region at which @xmath136 .",
    "if some negative component of effective energy density appears in @xmath25 then it can never dominate at the early universe and at the late times .",
    "if negative energy density scaling like @xmath137 appears in such a way that @xmath138 ( where @xmath139 ) then we have the case of bouncing cosmological models @xcite . in this model",
    "the relation @xmath136 is of course satisfied . in general the violation of the strong energy condition ( sec )",
    "is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the bounce to appear .",
    "the bouncing models can be characterised by the minimal condition under which the present universe arises from a bounce with a previous collapse phase ( note the reflectional symmetry of the basic equation @xmath140 ) @xcite . in order if we have such a situation that @xmath141 , then negative term @xmath142 can not dominate late evolution and therefore the scale factor should be bounded and an inverted bounce appears",
    ".    if the energy density is very large then quantum gravity corrections are important at both the big - bang and big - rip singularities .",
    "the account of quantum effects leads to avoid not only the initial singularity @xcite but also escape from the future singularity @xcite .",
    "the idea of bounce in frw cosmologies appeared in tolman s monograph devoted to cosmology @xcite .",
    "this idea was strictly connected with oscillating models @xcite . at present oscillating models",
    "play an important role in the brane cosmology @xcite .",
    "the frw universe undergoing a bounce instead of the big - bang is also an appealing idea in the context of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the attractiveness of bouncing models comes from the fact that they have no horizon problem and they explain quantum origin of structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "molina - paris and visser and later tippett @xcite characterised the bouncing models by the minimal condition under which the present universe arises from a bounce from the previous collapse phase ( the tolman wormhole is different name for denoting such a type of evolution ) .",
    "the violation of strong energy condition ( sec ) is in general a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for bounce to appear . for closed models",
    "it is sufficient condition and none of other energy condition need to be violated ( like null energy condition ( nec ) : @xmath143 , week energy condition ( wec ) : @xmath144 and @xmath145 , dominant energy condition ( dec ) : @xmath144 and @xmath146 energy conditions can be satisfied ) .",
    "we can find necessary and sufficient conditions for an evolutional path with a bounce by analysing dynamics on the phase plane ( @xmath147 ) , where @xmath74 is the scale factor and dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmological time .",
    "we understand the bounce as in @xcite , namely there must be some moment say @xmath148 in evolution of the universe at which the size of the universe has a minimum , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "this weak inequality @xmath151 is enough for giving domains in the phase space occupied by trajectories with the bounce .",
    "we understand the inverted bounce as the situation in which in some moment @xmath148 in evolution of the universe the size of the universe has a maximum , @xmath149 and @xmath152 .",
    "for our aim we considered some version above model in which for simplicity we put @xmath153 .",
    "if we rewrite this equation in @xmath154 variable we obtain for the flat model that @xmath155 where @xmath156 .",
    "our further task is be to confront the `` homological gas '' or variable @xmath6 fluid with snia data and for this purpose we calculate the luminosity distance in a standard way @xmath157 further in this section we will use the flat frw model since the evidence for this case is very strong in the light of wmap data @xcite .",
    "therefore while talking about model testing we actually mean the estimation of both @xmath158 and @xmath159 parameters for the best fitted flat model with homological gas .",
    "specifically we have tested this cosmology with prior assumption @xmath160 and @xmath161 as well as a model without prior assumption on @xmath162 .",
    "to proceeded with fitting snia data we need magnitude - redshift relation @xmath163 where : @xmath164 is the luminosity distance with @xmath124 factored out , so that marginalisation over the intercept @xmath165 leads actually to joint marginalisation @xmath124 and @xmath10 ( @xmath10 being the absolute magnitude of snia ) .    then we can obtain the best fit model minimising the function @xmath166 @xmath167 where their sum is over the snia sample and @xmath168 denote the ( full ) statistical error of magnitude determination .",
    "this is illustrated by figures of residuals ( with respect to einstein ",
    "de sitter model ) .",
    "one of the advantages of residual plots is that the intercept of the @xmath8@xmath154 curve gets cancelled .",
    "the assumption that the intercept is the same for different cosmological models is legitimate since @xmath169 is actually determined from the low ",
    "redshift part of the hubble diagram which should be linear in all realistic cosmologies",
    ".    however , the best  fit values alone are not relevant if not supplemented with the confidence levels for the parameters .",
    "therefore , we performed the estimation of model parameters using the minimisation procedure , based on the likelihood function .",
    "we assume that supernovae measurements came with uncorrelated gaussian errors and in this case the likelihood function @xmath170 could be determined from chi ",
    "square statistic @xmath171 while probability density function of cosmological parameters is derived from bayes s theorem @xcite .",

    "we have also derived one - dimensional probability distribution functions for @xmath177 obtained from joint marginalisation over @xmath159 and @xmath158 .",
    "the maximum value of such a pdf informs us about the most probable value of @xmath177 ( supported by supernovae data ) within the full class of homological models .",

    "samples c and k3 are similarly constructed as containing only low extinction supernovae .",

    "hence this class is representative of the models in which non matter component is responsible both for dark matter in halos and its diffuse part ( dark energy ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this results with these obtained for the model with @xmath194 .",
    "such model is equivalent to cardassian model @xcite . because this model was proposed as an alternative to @xmath6cdm , it was immediately verified by snia observations @xcite .",
    "however now it is possible to perform more precise test of the models using the new riess sample .    at first",
    "we have decided to test the our model ( both for vanishing and not vanishing cosmological constant ) using knop et al .",

    "for example , with in the with the maximum likelihood method , first class of models gives values of the parameter : @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , for sample k6 , while @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , for sample k3 .    with the new riess sample",
    "we obtain : @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , for silver sample , while @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , for gold sample .",
    "this result mean that for knop sample @xmath212 part play only marginal role and the model is very close to @xmath6cdm model .",
    "however with the new riess sample we obtain that @xmath213 with @xmath3 which correspond to ( hyper ) phantom model .",
    "however if we assume @xmath160 from independent extragalactic estimation @xcite , then @xmath212 is small and @xmath186 is close to zero , so @xmath6cdm model is favoured .    on fig .",
    "1 we present residuals plots with respect to the einstein - de sitter model for @xmath6cdm and our model .",
    "we observed that distant snia should be brighter ( in our model ) than in the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "what is interesting is that the hubble diagram for our model ( both for vanishing and non vanishing @xmath6 ) intersects the corresponding @xmath6cdm diagram .",
    "in such a way , the supernovae on intermediate distant are fainter then expected in the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "please note that the riess et al .",

    "the density distribution for model parameters for the model with fixed @xmath5 is presented on figs 8 - 10 .",
    "those figures confirmed that in this case the model is close to @xmath6cdm model .    for the model with vanishing cosmological constant @xmath218 the errors of the model parameters estimation",
    "is presented on table  [ tab:4 ] . for this model ,",
    "using the maximum likelihood method , we obtained with the sample k6 that @xmath223 and @xmath224 on the confidence level @xmath214 . in turn , for sample k3 we obtained that @xmath225 and @xmath226 on the confidence level @xmath214 . with the new riess et al .",

    "sample errors in estimation of the parameters significantly decreased .",
    "these results mean that if we assume @xmath5 then @xmath230 which correspond to @xmath6cdm model .    in this way , it is crucial to determine which combination of parameters give the preferred fit to data .",
    "this is the statistical problem of model selection @xcite .",
    "the problem is usually the elimination of parameters which play insufficient role in improving the fit data available .",
    "important role in this area plays especially the akaike information criterion aic @xcite .",
    "this criterion is defined as @xmath238 where @xmath170 is the maximum likelihood and @xmath75 is the number of the parameter of the model .",
    "the best model is the model which minimises the aic .",
    "the bayesian information criterion bic introduced by schwarz @xcite is defined as : @xmath239 where @xmath32 is the number of data points used in the fit .",
    "while aic tends to favour models with large number of parameters , the bic the more strongly penalises them , so bic provides the useful approximation to full evidence in the case of no prior on the set of model parameters @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of using these criteria in the current cosmological applications has been recently demonstrated by liddle @xcite please note that both information criteria values have no absolute sense and only the relative values between different models are physically interesting . for the bic a difference of @xmath240 is treated as a positive evidence ( @xmath241 as a strong evidence ) against the model with larger value of bic @xcite .",
    "the aic for the models under consideration is presented in the ( table  [ tab:5 ] ) while for bic in the ( table  [ tab:6 ] ) .",
    "the bic information criterion do not show significant differences between scaling multifluid model with vanishing @xmath6 and @xmath6cdm model . the model which minimising aic is scaling multifluids model with",
    "the vanishing cosmological constant ( equivalent to the cardassian model ) .",
    "it means that , from the statistical point of view , if we compare scaling multifluid models with vanishing and non - vanishing @xmath6 , the extra term with @xmath6 does not improve significantly the quality of the fit .    basing on aic information criterion , it is clear that the scaling multifluid model with vanishing @xmath6 fits better to data then the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "however scaling multifluid model with vanishing @xmath6 indicate high density universe , with @xmath242 which seems to be too high with comparison with present extragalactic data @xcite . scaling multifluid model with non - vanishing @xmath6 allow density of the universe @xmath243 close to 0.3 ( fig.7 ) while @xmath6cdm model predict @xmath244 .",
    "it clearly shows that more precise measurements of @xmath243 from independent observations is necessary to final discriminate between the @xmath6cdm and scaling multifluid models .",
    "the supernova cosmology project and the high  z  supernova search reported of their observations of type ia supernovae and suggest that the expansion of the universe is still accelerating due to the presence of unknown form of matter called dark energy . for the accelerating universe the equation of state parameter @xmath245 for",
    "dark must satisfy @xmath246 .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath6 is arguable , but at the some time the simplest candidate for this dark energy , although it is well known , that predictions for its value are many orders of magnitude off from the observationally acceptable value .",
    "the introducing of @xmath247 or quintessence is usually proposed as a possible solution to avoid the cosmological constant problem .    in presented paper the idea of derivation the form of equation of state from symmetries of self - similarity of the frw dynamics",
    "is considered .",
    "we have shown that these symmetries enforce appropriate equation of state used commonly in cosmology .",
    "the property of homology is very important in astrophysics , when main sequence in the hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagram can be reconstructed from the invariants of homology transformations .",
    "moreover from the strmgren s theorem , new solution of stellar structure equation can be obtained from the known ones through the homologous transformation .",
    "the new solutions describe new configurations with different masses , radius and chemical compositions ( the so  called homologous stars ) . for recently obtained results see @xcite where this problem is addressed in the context of brane cosmology .",
    "we pointed out that our universe is also homological provided that it is filled by matter with the form of equation of state for noninteracting mixture of fluids @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "this form is commonly used in cosmological considerations .",
    "the key idea of this work is derivation this form of the equation of state from the first principles .",
    "it is proposed to derivate @xmath58 from postulate of self - similarity of its dynamics .",
    "this property is well known to engineers who build ship models as a prototype of real ship .",
    "it is justified by the fact that navier - stoke s equation are invariant against similarity symmetries .    as a result",
    "we obtain the commonly used form of equation of state for mixture of noninteracting , dust matter , dark energy ( the cosmological constant ) and cosmic time variation of cosmological constant parameterised by the scale factor",
    ". therefore subliminal role of mathematics can also be seen in cosmology when we are looking for adequate form of equation of state for dark energy .",
    "we showed that the model with scaling multifluids fits well the supernovae data .",
    "for simplicity of presentation we demonstrate this for the case @xmath250 .",
    "physically it means that the universe is filled generally by dust matter , cosmological constant fluid and additional scaling fluid which comes from cardassian modification of the frw equation ( or equivalently it it is scaling fluid describing phantom fields for example ) .    for the scaling multifluids model with @xmath251 , we found that @xmath2 with @xmath3 which correspond to ( hyper ) phantom model .",
    "if we assume @xmath5 from independent extragalactic estimation , then @xmath189 is small while value of @xmath186 close to zero is favoured and model becomes close to @xmath6cdm . with assumption that @xmath194 the model is equivalent to cardassian models .",
    "we confirmed our previous results @xcite on the new riess sample .",
