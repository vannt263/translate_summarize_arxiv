    "the original seceder model  @xcite is based on @xmath2 individuals with a real number @xmath9 representing the traits ( or personality ) of individual @xmath7 .",

    "the model we propose is then , starting from any graph with @xmath2 vertices and @xmath3 edges , to iterate the following steps :    1 .",

    "[ lab : select ] 2 .",
    "pick the one @xmath13 of these that is least central in the following sense : if the graph is connected vertices of highest eccentricity are the least central .",

    "that @xmath8 s edges are rewired mainly to the neighborhood of @xmath13 ( and @xmath13 itself ) reflects the inheritance of trait value of the original model  by the homophily assumption the neighborhood of @xmath13 will have much the same personality as @xmath13 itself . the main difference between original and the networked seceder model is step [ lab : random ] where some vertices are rewired to distant vertices .",
    "the motivation for this step is that long - range connections exists in real - world networks  @xcite , and can in some situations be even more important than the strong links of a cohesive group  @xcite .",
    "this kind of rewiring , to obtain long - range connections has been used to model `` small - world behavior '' of networks  @xcite ( i.e.  a logarithmic , or slower , scaling of the average inter - vertex distance for ensembles of graphs with the same average degree  @xcite ) .    to make the model consistent we also have to specify the initial graph . as far as we can see , at least for finite @xmath23 , this choice is irrelevant  the structure of the generated graphs are the same ( or at least very similar ) .",
    "we will not investigate this point further .",
    "instead we fix the initial graph to an instant of erds and rnyi s random graph model  @xcite ( for a modern survey of this model , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : a graph with @xmath2 edges and @xmath3 edges is constructed by starting from isolated vertices and then iteratively introduce edges between vertex - pairs chosen by uniform randomness and with the restriction that no multiple edges or loops are allowed . to be sure that the structure of the random graph is gone we run the construction algorithm @xmath24 sweeps through every vertex before the graph is sampled .",
    "( we justify this number _ a posteriori _ below . )",
    "an illustration of the construction algorithm can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mo ] .",
    "an realization of the algorithm is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : shot ] .",
    "the @xmath23-value of this realization is zero . for the value @xmath25 we use in most simulations",
    "the community structure is less visible to the eye .",
    "nevertheless  as we will see  the community structure is still substantial for much larger values of @xmath23 .      to analyze the structure of cohesive subgroups in our model networks we use the community detection scheme presented in ref .",
    "this algorithm starts from one - vertex clusters and ( somewhat reminiscent of the algorithm in ref .",
    "@xcite ) iteratively merges clusters to form clusters of increasing size with relatively few edges to the outside .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the scheme is a quality function @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the set of subnetworks at a specific iteration of the algorithm and @xmath28 is the fraction of edges that goes between a vertex in @xmath14 and a vertex in @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the algorithm performs a steepest - accent in @xmath31-space  at each iteration the two clusters that leads to the largest increase ( or smallest decrease ) in @xmath31 are merged .",
    "the iteration having the highest @xmath31 value  which defines the _ modularity _ @xmath32gives the partition into subgroups .",
    "one can argue that some network structures are more basic than other .",
    "given such an assumption and a network @xmath33 , an interesting issue is whether a certain structure , say @xmath34 , is an artifact of a more basic structure , say @xmath35 .",
    "one way to do this is by a _ conditional uniform graph test _ : one compares the value of @xmath36 with @xmath34 averaged over an ensemble of graphs with a the value of @xmath35 fixed to @xmath37 .",
    "this has ( since ref .",
    "@xcite ) been a well established technique in social network analysis and has recently been brought over to physicists  @xcite and biologists  @xcite network literature .",
    "a common assumption  @xcite is that the degree distribution is such a very basic structure .",
    "we make this assumption too and perform a conditional uniform graph test with respect to the degree sequence of the networks . to sample networks with a given degree sequence we use the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite to rewire the edges of the network in such a way that the degree sequence remains unaltered .",
    "more precisely we go through all edges @xmath38 and perform the following :    1 .",
    "construct the set @xmath39 of edges such that if @xmath40 then replacing @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43 and @xmath44 would not introduce any loops ( self - edges ) or multiple edges .",
    "pick an edge @xmath40 by uniform randomness .",
    "rewire @xmath41 to @xmath43 and @xmath42 to @xmath44 .    for every realization of the seceder algorithm we sample @xmath45 randomized reference networks as described above .",
    "the motivation for this rather low number is that all quantities seems to be self - averaging ( the fluctuations decrease with @xmath2 ) and many have symmetric distributions with respect to rewirings ( which makes many realization averages compensate for few rewiring averages ) . to further motivate this small @xmath46 we compare with @xmath47 for the smallest size ( @xmath48 , which",
    ", as mentioned , is most affected by fluctuations ) and find that the quantities typically differ by @xmath49 which we consider small .",
    "the key quantity capturing the degree of community order in the network is the modularity @xmath32 ( defined in sect .",
    "[ sec : clust ] ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q](a ) we see that , if the average degree and @xmath23 is kept constant @xmath32 converges to a high value , @xmath50 for @xmath25 and @xmath51 .",
    "this value is much higher than the reference value from the randomized networks  this curve has a peak around @xmath52 and decays for larger @xmath2 , larger sizes would be needed to see of @xmath32 converges to a finite value for the randomized networks . with the analogy to the watts - strogatz model ( where a fraction @xmath23 of a circulant s  @xcite edges is rewired randomly ) we would say that @xmath25 is a rather high value , still @xmath32 is much higher for the networked seceder model than for random networks with the same degree distribution . from this we conclude that our model fulfills its purpose  it produces networks with a pronounced community structure just as the original seceder model makes",
    "agents divide into well - defined groups in trait - space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q](b ) we plot the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath32 for fixed @xmath53 and @xmath25 .",
    "we see that @xmath32 decreases with @xmath3 for both the seceder model and the randomized networks .",
    "as @xmath3 approaches its maximum value @xmath54 the curves will converge ( since the fully connected graph is unique ) , but the figure shows that the curves are separated for a wide parameter range .",
    "more importantly it suggests that the quantity @xmath32 should be rescaled by some appropriate function if networks of different average degree are to be compared . in the rest of our paper , however , we will keep the degree constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q](c ) we show the @xmath23-dependence of @xmath32 .",
    "as expected @xmath32 decays monotonously , in fact almost linearly , with @xmath23 .",
    "the curves for the seceder model converges to the curve of the randomized networks as @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath32 of the randomized reference networks is almost @xmath23-independent .",
    "the fact that it is not completely @xmath23-independent means that the degree distribution of the seceder model must vary with @xmath23 .",
    "we will strengthen this claim later .",
    "[ fig : groups ] shows the size - dependence of @xmath56the number of groups .",
    "we see that this function can be well - described by a constant plus a power - law , @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is a constant ) with an exponent @xmath59 for the seceder model and @xmath60 for the random networks with the same degree distribution .",
    "the average community - size is given by @xmath61 and will therefore also behave as a power - law , with exponent @xmath62 . this fact that for the number and average size of the communities grows with @xmath2 does not seem contradictory to the real world to us . since a community , both in a social and economical interpretation of the model ,",
    "does not need to be controlled or supervised there is no natural upper limit to the number of community members .",
    "furthermore , there is no particular constraint on the number of communities present in real world systems .",
    "a thorough study of the scaling - exponents would be interesting , but falls out of the scope of the present paper .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ii ] we display the average geodesic lengths within a community @xmath63 and between vertices of different communities @xmath64 for parameter values @xmath51 and @xmath25 .",
    "to be precise , we consider the largest connected component ( which typically contains @xmath65 of the vertices ) , and define    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the @xmath7th cluster and @xmath68 is the number of pairs of vertices belonging to the same community . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ii](a ) and ( b ) both @xmath63 and @xmath64 grows logarithmically as functions of @xmath2 with the same slope in a semi - logarithmic plot . a logarithmic scaling of the average shortest path length ( which of course also holds )",
    "is expected ( cf.ref .",
    "but we could not anticipate the lack of qualitative difference between distances between vertices of the same an different clusters .",
    "the actual values of @xmath63 is significantly smaller than @xmath64 and this difference holds as @xmath69 : as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ii](c ) @xmath70 converges to @xmath71 .",
    "the same value for the randomized graphs is @xmath72 which is expected  the detected communities in the networked seceder model are more well - defined and tight - knit that the corresponding communities in a random network with the same degree distribution .",
    "apart from the quantities of the previous section , all directly related to the community structure , we also look at some other well established structural measures : the clustering coefficient , the assortative mixing coefficient and the degree distribution .",
    "following the works of barabsi and coworkers  @xcite the degree distribution has been perhaps the most studied network structure .",
    "many of these studies have found a skewed , power - law tailed , degree - distribution . in some social networks  of telephone calls  @xcite , e - mail communication  @xcite and the network of sexual contacts  @xcite  authors have found large tails of the degree distribution that fits well to a power - law functional form .",
    "other social network studies report degree distributions with large degree cut - offs , these contain network of movie actor  @xcite , scientific collaborations  @xcite or internet community interaction  @xcite or romantic interaction among high school students ( the network of ref .",
    "@xcite as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . yet other studies have found social networks with gaussian degree distributions ( the acquaintance networks of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or exponential degree distributions ( of e - mail networks  @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the degree distribution of social networks is still an open question with , most likely , not a single solution ",
    "different social networks may follow different degree distributions .",
    "the degree distribution of the networked seceder model is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : deg ] .",
    "we note that @xmath73 has an exponential tail , notably larger than the poisson degree distribution  @xcite @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the mean degree ) of the initial random graph , but far from as wide as a power - law .",
    "clearly this falls into one of the cases mentioned above .",
    "we note that as @xmath23 grows the degree distribution gets closer to the original network ( this was anticipated in sect .  [",
    "sec : commu ] ) .      the clustering coefficient @xmath76 measures the fraction of connected triples of vertices that form a triad .",
    "this type of statistics has been popular since ref .",
    "the definition we use is slightly different from that of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes ten number of representations of circuits of length @xmath79 and @xmath80 denotes the number of representations of paths of length @xmath79 .",
    "( by ` representation ' we mean an ordered triple such that one vertex is adjacent to the vertex before or after .",
    "for example , a triangle has six representations  all permutations of the three vertices . )",
    "this definition is common in sociology ( although sociologists emphasize triad statistics for directed networks)see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review  but is also frequent in physicists literature since ref .",
    "@xcite . a plot of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath2",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr](a ) .",
    "we see that @xmath76 for the seceder model converges to a constant value rather rapidly .",
    "similarity the @xmath76 for the rewired networks goes to zero roughly over the same time scale .",
    "the fact that community structure induces a high clustering is well known and modeled  @xcite , as is the fact that the clustering vanishes like @xmath81 in a random graph with poisson degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "the assortative mixing coefficient  @xcite is the pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees at either side of an edge : @xmath82 where subscript @xmath7 denotes the @xmath7th argument and average is over the edge set .",
    "@xmath83 is known to be positive in many social networks  @xcite ( networks of online interaction does not seem to follow this rule  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that this assortative mixing can be related to community structure  @xcite . against this backdrop",
    "it is pleasing , but not surprising , to note that the networked seceder model produces networks with markedly positive @xmath83 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cr](b ) .",
    "the reference networks with the same degree sequences converges to zero from negative values , as also observed in ref .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that networks formed by agents without any preference for the degrees of the neighboring vertices gets negative @xmath83 from the restriction that only one edge can go between one pair of vertices .",
    "this is probably the reason for the negative @xmath83 values of the rewired networks .",
    "in this section we look at the dynamics of the communities . to do this we need criteria for if a cluster @xmath84 at time @xmath85 is the same as cluster @xmath86 at time @xmath87 .",
    "the idea is to find the best possible matching of vertices between the partition into clusters of the two consecutive time steps . to give a mathematical definition ,",
    "let @xmath88 be the partition of @xmath89 into clusters by the algorithm described in sect .",
    "[ sec : clust ] and let @xmath90 .",
    "now we define a mapping @xmath91 from @xmath92 elements of @xmath93 $ ] to @xmath92 elements of @xmath94 $ ] such that the overlap @xmath95 is maximized ( @xmath96 denotes cardinality ) .",
    "let @xmath97 denote this maximized @xmath98 value . to calculate this overlap we use the straightforward method of testing all matchings . in principle",
    "this algorithm runs in exponential time , but since the number of groups is typically rather low systems of a few hundred vertices numerically tractable .",
    "the evolution of the group structure , with the group structure identified as described above , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : tme](a ) and ( b ) we see the time evolution of the assortative mixing coefficient @xmath83 and the clustering coefficient @xmath76 , whose average size - scaling was studied in sect .  [",
    "sec : osc ] .",
    "we note that the assortative mixing coefficient fluctuates rather much . even though it is mostly positive ( remember that the average value is significantly positive ) it also have rather pronounced negative values .",
    "this is likely to be a finite size phenomenon  as the assortative mixing coefficient is self - averaging  @xcite , larger systems would not fluctuate much and have stable positive values ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr](b ) ) . the clustering coefficient as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme](b ) shows a more stable evolutionary trajectory . over a time scale roughly corresponding to @xmath99 updating steps @xmath76 goes from the value of the initial erds - rnyi value to the higher clustering coefficient of the networked seceder model .",
    "this is natural since it is also roughly the time scale for all vertices to be picked and rewired once .",
    "the value of the modularity @xmath32 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme](c ) , is shows a similar behavior as the clustering coefficient as it increases from the value @xmath100 of the original random graph to @xmath101 of the seceder model . @xmath76 and @xmath32 seem to be strongly correlated , something that seems very logical in the context of the seceder model ",
    "the clustering coefficient increases when a high degree vertex is rewired to a specific cluster , a process that also strengthens the community structure .",
    "if this strong @xmath76-@xmath32 correlation is a more ubiquitous property is an interesting problem for future studies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme](d ) we plot the overlap @xmath102 which fluctuates between @xmath103 and @xmath104 with an average well below @xmath105 .",
    "these values are lower than we expected _ a priori _ , as it means than identity of more than half the group members changes a typical time step .",
    "just as the fluctuations in @xmath83 , we expect the fluctuations in the cluster structure to decrease with system size , therefore @xmath106 will increase with @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tme](e ) the time development of different cluster sizes is illustrated .",
    "a horizontal cross section gives the size partitioning of the vertex set at a given time step .",
    "a demarcated area represents a group .",
    "older groups are above younger groups .",
    "an observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : tme](e ) is that groups typically lives between one and 100 time steps . the life - time scale of groups seems to coincide with that of the initial relaxation to the seceder equilibrium .",
    "we also note that there seems to be no particular correlation between age and stability or size , a situation that would have produced skewed life time or cluster size distributions . at the bottom of the diagram ,",
    "hardly visible , there are numerous small , short - lived , clusters .",
    "this is an effect of isolates constantly present in the system ( for this set of parameter values there are typically one or two at a time step ) .",
    "the observations in this section were checked for a few other runs and seems to be representative . since they do not hint some surprising phenomena ( against the backdrop of the previous sections and the algorithm itself ) we do not conduct any extensive statistical survey of the dynamical properties .",
    "we have proposed a model for network formation based on the seceder model .",
    "the model captures how a community structure can emerge from the desire to be different , both in social and economic systems .",
    "the community structure of our model is analyzed with a recent graph clustering scheme .",
    "this scheme has the advantage that it gives a measure of the degree of community structure in a network  the modularity @xmath32 .",
    "we see that the @xmath32 is much higher for our model networks than for random reference networks with the same degree distributions . both the number of groups and the average of size of groups growth as power - laws with sub - linear exponents .",
    "both the average geodesic distance between vertices of the same and different clusters grows logarithmically ; the difference between these , however , is much larger for the networked seceder model than for the random reference networks .",
    "the general picture is thus the the networked seceder model generates well - defined communities just like the agents of the original seceder model gets clustered in trait space .",
    "the networked seceder model gives networks of high clustering and positive assortative mixing by degree ",
    "properties that are known to be characteristic of acquaintance networks .",
    "the degree distribution has a peak around the average degree and a exponentially decaying , also that consistent with real world observations",
    ".    the dynamics of the communities were briefly investigated by defining a mapping between consecutive time steps that maximizes an overlap function . using this method",
    "we conclude that the speed of the dynamics is set by the size of the system .",
    "we see that the clustering coefficient and modularity are strongly correlated and that older groups are not necessarily larger than younger .",
    "to epitomize , the networked seceder model gives an mechanism of emergent community structure that is different from earlier proposed mechanisms in network models  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is arguably present in , at least , social networks  @xcite .",
