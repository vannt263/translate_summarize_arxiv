    "the assembly of colloidal building blocks with designer engineered size , shape , and chemical anisotropy seems to be the next step in the fundamental and applied colloid science and science of soft materials , vigorously pursued by many researchers @xcite .",
    "moving beyond the traditional systems implies the creation of designer colloidal building blocks such as colloidal molecules , janus spheres , and other patchy particle motifs that have very different propensities for self - assembly @xcite . in order to realize this goal",
    "one needs detailed control over various aspects of colloid geometry at the nanoscale ( _ e.g. _ , aspect ratio , faceting , branching , roughness ) and microscale ( _ e.g. _ , chemical ordering , shape gradients , unary and binary colloidal `` molecules '' ) .",
    "the ability to spatially modify the surface structure of colloids with designed chemical heterogeneity , _",
    "e.g. _ , to form a patchy surface structure , seems to be becoming a realistic goal .",
    "fabrication of stable anisotropic microcapsules was recently accomplished by the layer - by - layer polyelectrolyte adsorption technique combined with particle lithography technique to produce anisotropic polymer microcapsules with a single nanoscale patch @xcite .",
    "granick and co - workers @xcite recently reported a highly scalable synthetic pathway for creating bipolar janus spheres , _",
    "i.e. _ , particles that consist of oppositely charged hemispheres . such colloidal  animals \" which are probably the simplest example of patchy colloids , exhibit orientation - dependent interactions that go together with localized patches of like / unlike charges or hydrophobic / hydrophilic regions .",
    "this heterogeneous interaction landscape promotes the formation of larger colloidal molecules and clusters that are themselves patchy .",
    "these advances in the nano- and microscopic tailoring of ( charged ) colloids motivated various approaches to generalizations of the existing theories of electrostatic interactions in charged colloids by explicitly including the structure of the counterions as embodied by their multipolar moments .",
    "the inclusion of structured counterions of a dipolar @xcite and quadrupolar @xcite type into the theory of electrostatic colloidal interactions has brought fourth some of the salient features of the counterion structure effects , which on face value appear to be quite distinct from the standard poisson - boltzmann framework . in view of these advances in the study of interactions between charged colloids it thus seems appropriate to explore the ramifications of the emerging paradigm if applied to these more complicated structured colloidal molecules .",
    "especially the non - spherically symmetric charge distribution of microscopically tailored colloidal particles might lead to some unexpected properties of electrostatic interactions in this type of systems . with this in mind",
    "we thus embark on a thorough examination of the consequences of multipolar charge distribution of mobile counterions that mediate interactions between charged ( planar ) macroions .",
    "in what follows we will consider a system of fixed macroions of surface charge distribution @xmath0 in an aqueous solution , described as a dielectric continuum with a dielectric constant @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 , containing @xmath3 neutralizing counterions .",

    "the partition function in the above form can not be evaluated explicitly except in the one - dimensional case @xcite where the partition function evaluation is reduced to a solution of a schr \" odinger - like equation .",
    "nevertheless the field - theoretical representation of the grand canonical partition function allows one to use quite powerful analytical approaches that eventually lead to an explicit evaluation of the partition function in two well defined and complementary limits @xcite that we shall address later in this paper .",
    "these limits retain the relevance also in the case of structured counterions .",
    "one may obtain a dimensionless representation for the present system by rescaling all length scales with a given characteristic length scale . recall that the characteristic distance at which two unit charges interact with thermal energy @xmath54 is known as the bjerrum length @xmath55 ( in water at room temperature , the value is @xmath56 nm ) .",
    "if the charge valency of counterions is @xmath10 then the aforementioned distance scales as @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , the distance at which a counterion interacts with a macromolecular surface of surface charge density @xmath58 with an energy @xmath54 is called the gouy - chapman length , defined as @xmath59 . a competition between ion - ion and ion - surface interactions",
    "can thus be quantified by the ratio ( @xmath60 ) of these characteristic lengths , that is @xmath61 which is referred to as the electrostatic coupling parameter .    in what follows , we may rescale the length scales with the gouy - chapman length , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath62 ; hence , the surface separation will be rescaled as @xmath63 or the rescaled half - distance as @xmath64 .",
    "other dimensionless quantities can be defined as follows .",
    "the dimensionless multipolar moments are defined as @xmath65 and the dimensionless pressure as @xmath66    for simple structureless counterions the functional integral ( [ funint ] ) can be rescaled @xcite yielding @xmath67\\,\\rme^{- h'[\\phi({{\\mathbf r}})]/\\xi},\\ ] ] with dimensionless @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "as will be shown later an identical representation can be obtained also for structured counterions , described on the level of a multipolar expansion of their charge density .",
    "in the absence of a general approach that would cover thoroughly all the regions of the parameter space one has to take recourse to various partial formulations that take into account only this or that facet of the problem @xcite .",
    "the traditional approach to these one - component coulomb fluids has been the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) formalism applicable at weak surface charges , low counterion valency and high temperature @xcite .",
    "the limitations of this approach become practically important in highly - charged systems where counterion - mediated interactions between charged bodies start to deviate substantially from the mean - field accepted wisdom @xcite .",
    "one of the most important recent advances in this field has been the systematization of these non - pb effects based on the notions of _ weak _ and _ strong _ coupling approximations .",
    "they are based on the field - theoretical representation of grand canonical partition function ( [ action ] ) , whose behavior depends on a single dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath60 @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "the weak - coupling ( wc ) limit of @xmath69 coincides exactly with the mean - field poisson - boltzmann theory @xcite and is based on a collective description of the counterion density .",
    "the strong coupling ( sc ) limit of @xmath70 is diametrically opposite and corresponds to a single particle description .",
    "it has been pioneered by rouzina and bloomfield @xcite , elaborated later by shklovskii _",
    "_ @xcite and levin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and eventually brought into a final form by netz _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "these two limits are distinguished by the pertaining values of the coupling parameter @xmath60 which can be introduced in the following way .",
    "the regime of @xmath71 is the case of low counterionic valency and/or weakly charged surfaces , and is referred to as the weak - coupling limit .",
    "it is characterized by the fact that the width of the counterion layer @xmath72 is much larger than the separation between two neighbouring counterions in solution and thus the counterion layer behaves basically as a three - dimensional gas .",
    "each counterion in this case interacts with many others and the collective mean - field approach of the poisson - boltzmann type is completely justified .    on the other hand in the strong coupling regime @xmath73 , which is true for high valency of counterions and/or highly charged surfaces . in this case",
    "the mean distance between counterions , @xmath74 , is much larger than the layer width ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath75 ) , indicating that the counterions are highly localized laterally and form a strongly correlated quasi - two - dimensional layer next to a charged surface . in this case",
    ", the weak - coupling approach breaks down due to strong counterion - surface and counterion - counterion correlations .",
    "since counterions can move almost independently from the others along the direction perpendicular to the surface , the collective many - body effects that enable a mean - field description are absent , necessitating a complementary sc description @xcite .",
    "these two approximations allow for an explicit and exact treatment of charged systems at two disjoint limiting conditions whereas the parameter space in between can be analysed only approximately and is mostly accessible solely _ via _ computer simulations .",
    "as will become clear in what follows the wc and sc limits remain valid also for structured counterions described with a multipolar charge distribution .",
    "the mean - field limit , @xmath69 , is defined _ via _ the saddle - point configuration of the hamiltonian ( [ action ] ) @xcite and is valid for a weakly charged system .",
    "this leads to the following generalization of the poisson - boltzmann equation @xmath76 } \\label{pb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the real - valued potential field @xmath77 .",
    "note that the dielectric discontinuity at the boundaries is irrelevant within the mean - field theory @xcite since in the planar geometry this is effectively one - dimensional theory .",
    "taking now the counterion density function as a sum of the monopolar , dipolar and quadrupolar terms , where the mean - field depends only on the transverse coordinate @xmath78 , the above equation can be written in dimensionless form as @xmath79 where we have defined dimensionless potential @xmath80 with corresponding derivatives @xmath81 and @xmath82 and dimensionless multipolar moments @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we defined the orientational variable @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the angle between the @xmath78-axis , assume to coincide with the normal to the bounding surfaces , the director of the uni - axial counterion is @xmath14 and the integral over this variable gives the orientational average .",
    "we have also introduced @xmath87 which is obviously the local orientationally dependent number density of the counterions and @xmath88 is the corresponding orientationally averaged charge density of the counterions . in the case of higher multipoles",
    "the number density and the charge density of the counterions are not proportional .",
    "expressions @xmath89 are simply the orientationally averaged multipolar charge densities , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath90 for monopolar charge , @xmath91 for dipolar charge etc .",
    ", that are simply proportional to the three terms in the integrand of ( [ quadpb1 ] )",
    ". the corresponding prefactor is simply obtained by appropriate normalisation of @xmath92 to satisfy electro - neutrality condition of the system .",
    "the above pb equation has to be supplemented by an appropriate boundary condition at @xmath24 corresponding to the electroneutrality of the system by taking into account surface charges , @xmath58 .",
    "the constant @xmath93 is set by these boundary conditions , as is the case in the standard pb theory . in dimensionless units",
    "these boundary conditions read @xmath94 .",
    "obviously in the case of counterions with only monopolar charge distribution the above set of equations reduces to the standard poisson - boltzmann theory .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath95 for the parallel plane geometry simply excludes the counterion configurations that would penetrate the bounding walls and depends on the geometric form of the counterions .",
    "since in what follows we will not be interested in steric effects , we will assume that all counterions are pointlike , and so @xmath96 .",
    "steric effects have been studied elsewhere @xcite .",
    "because of the similarity with the standard pb equation for monopolar charges one is led to believe that the pressure in an inhomogeneous system of multipolar countercharge can be derived in the same way as in the standard pb theory , _ via _ the s.c .",
    "contact value theorem @xcite .",
    "indeed this can be proven exactly , namely the mean - field pressure can be obtained from the first integral of the pb equation ( [ quadpb1 ] ) .",
    "after some manipulations its first integral is obtained in the form @xmath97 . \\label{p1}\\ ] ] here @xmath98 is the dimensionless equilibrium pressure in the system , defined as ( [ p_dimless ] ) . the r.h.s . of the above identity",
    "can be calculated at any arbitrary point @xmath99 as its value is independent of @xmath100 .",
    "the choice of the actual point is governed by the symmetry of the system , as is usual also in the standard pb theory .",
    "since we delve only on the symmetrical solution , with inversion symmetry centered on @xmath101 , the derivative of the mean potential at the mid - point must vanish , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath102 .",
    "thus in this case @xmath103 while the first - vant hoff - term corresponds to repulsive interactions of the standard pb type , the second term in this particular geometry and symmetry entails attractive interactions between the bounding surfaces .",
    "note that @xmath104 .",
    "let us take a closer look at the above expression .",
    "for a polyelectrolyte chain , _",
    "i.e. _ , an extended and flexible counterion , one can derive a similar type of pressure formula @xcite , with a negative term that contributes an attractive part to the force equilibrium .",
    "this attractive part in the case of polyelectrolytes is due to polyelectrolyte bridging interactions @xcite that stem from the connectivity and flexibility of the polyelectrolyte chain .",
    "does equation ( [ p3 ] ) have a similar physical content ?",
    "this interpretation certainly does not seem likely for point counterions , for which the above pressure formula was derived .",
    "the structure of the first integral of the pb equation ( [ p3 ] ) seems to be saying that apart from the ideal contribution to the equilibrium pressure , a term proportional to the midpoint number density , one also finds an electrostatic contribution that is due to the interaction between the monopolar and the quadrupolar part of the counterion charge density across the midplane and is proportional to the square of the midpoint density , see ( [ quadpb1 ] ) .",
    "the attractive part thus does not look like bridging which has its origin in the connectivity and flexibility of the polyelectrolyte chain , but more like a virial expansion in terms of the multipolar interactions .",
    "this is of course only true for point - like counterions .",
    "for extended counterions a bridging interpretation would be more appropriate as was already clear in the early studies of structured counterions @xcite .",
    "the above pb equation is a fourth order highly non - linear integro - differential equation and therefore difficult to handle with conventional numerical procedures .",
    "since here we are not particularly interested in the weak coupling results , we want only to show that the effect of quadrupolar moments , @xmath84 , on the interaction pressure is to induce a small attractive contribution . in order to show this we expand ( [ quadpb1 ] ) to the first order in @xmath84 and put @xmath105 , which then reads @xmath106 this equation",
    "can be solved much more easily with conventional numerical methods . although we must be aware that it is valid only for small @xmath84 .",
    "the corresponding formula for interaction pressure in the 1st order in @xmath84 expansion reads @xmath107 due to a convenient cancellation the formula contains no explicit @xmath84-dependence , but the pressure still depends on @xmath84 implicitly , due to the @xmath84 dependent potential @xmath108 . as can be shown numerically for small @xmath84 the correction to the standard pb pressure depends linearly on @xmath84 .",
    "here we are not interested in the details of the mean - field results  they were analyzed in detail before @xcite but list them for completeness anyhow . in what follows",
    "we delimit ourselves to counterions that posses monopolar and quadrupolar charge , so we do not take into account any dipoles ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "( a )    0.25 cm     ( b )    0.25 cm     ( c )    the density profile on fig .",
    "[ figpb](a ) corresponds to monopolar density @xmath109 , ( [ quadpb1 ] ) .",
    "counterions are localized preferentially in the vicinity of both surfaces due to mutual repulsion that prevents them from being localized at the center .",
    "what we then observe is that with increase of the quadrupolar moment , @xmath84 , counterions concentrate at surfaces even more . this can be easily explained .",
    "the potential energy of every quadrupolar particle in electrostatic potential is @xmath110 since the second derivative of the mean - field potential @xmath111 in the symmetric case considered here is a concave function of the coordinate @xmath78 , this means that the quadrupolar force , @xmath112 , acts away from the center toward both surfaces .",
    "the insight into the orientation of quadrupolar moments can be obtained through the average of the square of variable @xmath113 , namely @xmath114 , @xmath115 it is instructive to define an orientational order parameter @xmath116 this order parameter can have values in the range from @xmath117 to @xmath118 . in a totally disordered system where quadrupoles point randomly in all possible directions @xmath119 , and the orientational order parameter vanishes , @xmath120 . in the completely ordered case , @xmath121 and @xmath122 ,",
    "so that all quadrupolar moments are parallel with the @xmath78-axis and perpendicular to the walls , @xmath123 .",
    "the other extremum , @xmath124 , corresponds to @xmath125 so that all quadrupolar moments are perpendicular to @xmath78-axis and parallel with the walls , @xmath126 .",
    "[ figpb](b ) shows the numerically obtained profile of the orientational order parameter .",
    "it increases with increasing quadrupolar strength @xmath84 and is larger at both surfaces than at the center .",
    "the order parameter @xmath127 indicates that quadrupolar moments are preferentially aligned parallel to the @xmath78-axis . according to ( [ wt ] )",
    "the electrostatic energy can be minimized by increasing @xmath128 , since @xmath104 .",
    "so @xmath129 really is preferably increased above the value of @xmath130 .    the quadrupolar contribution to",
    "the pressure for @xmath131 turns out to be to be attractive , fig .",
    "[ figpb ] , as was shown before @xcite .",
    "again this attractive contribution is obtained here on the mean - field level where the inter - counterionic correlations , essential in the strong coupling limit , play no role .",
    "it is indeed the _ intra - counterion correlations _ ( entering here _ via _ the rigid structure assumed for counterions ) that lead to such attractive contributions . at this juncture",
    "it does not make much sense to us in continuing the multipolar expansion to yet higher orders , that would become relevant for even more aspherical and elongated charge distributions that would obviously entail also some molecular flexibility . in that case",
    "one could use the well developed theory of polyelectrolyte mediated interactions with much better confidence @xcite .",
    "in the strong coupling limit , @xmath132 , the system is highly charged and counterions are highly correlated .",
    "the partition function ( [ funint ] ) can be approximated by the two lowest order terms in the virial expansion with respect to the ( renormalized ) fugacity @xcite @xmath133 the second term corresponds to a one - particle partition function as the sc limit is effectively a single particle theory . @xmath134 and @xmath135 are then given by @xmath136 , \\label{funint - sc-0}\\ ] ] which is the exponential of the interaction between bare surface charges , and @xmath137 , \\label{funint - sc-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the partition function of all possible ( single ) counterion configurations .",

    "i.e. _ , spatial derivatives , the counterion energy in a homogeneous external electrostatic potential depends only on the first , monopolar term ( [ funint - u-0 ] ) .",

    "writing them up _ in extenso _ we obtain @xmath143 here , the first expression , @xmath144 , corresponds to the interaction between a monopole and its own monopole image , therefore it is proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "the second term , @xmath146 , corresponds to the monopole - dipole image interaction which is obviously the same as the dipole - monopole image interaction , @xmath147 , and so on for all the higher order terms .",

    "it appears that for highly charged counterions , that are in fact the only ones where the multipolar expansion really makes sense , most of the electrostatics is properly captured by the monopolar term .",
    "higher order multipoles simply do not contribute to the pressure in the system in the sc limit .",
    "of course all of this is valid in the limit of homogeneous dielectric properties for planar surfaces without any image effects .",
    "the counterion density profile can be extracted from ( [ freeen ] ) as an integrand in the second term , @xmath166 in the case without the dielectric mismatch the density profile is simply homogeneous , @xmath167 .",
    "dielectric images induce an additional repulsion between the counterions and the surface charges pushing them towards the midplane region between the two charged bounding surfaces .",
    "orientational order of quadrupoles can be inspected _ via _ averaged @xmath114 which is here defined as @xmath168 we can now use the same definition of order parameter @xmath169 as in wc , ( [ eqs ] ) .",
    "we now present some numerical results for the sc limit . without any dielectric mismatches the density profile of the monopolar counterions is homogeneous , _ i.e.",
    "_ , it does not depend on @xmath78 , which is a well known result @xcite . in the case of multipoles with dielectric images",

    "this is due to the attractive monopole - quadrupole image contribution , represented by the @xmath175 and @xmath176 terms which are proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "as @xmath84 increases further ( approximately for @xmath177 for large @xmath178 ) the repulsive quadrupole - quadrupole image contribution , @xmath179 , which is proportional with @xmath180 , takes over and confines counterions to the center even more so that the density peak sharpens up . for the value @xmath178 large enough ,",
    "so that density profile becomes bell - shaped , the sc density profile can be approximated by a gaussian curve with a variance , _",
    "i.e. _ , peak width , of the form @xmath181 as can be seen , small @xmath84 widens the density peak , but further increasing @xmath84 over the value @xmath177 the peak narrows . also by increasing parameters @xmath60 ,",

    "this is due to the strong quadrupole - quadrupole image repulsion , @xmath179 , which has its minimum at @xmath183 and is not a purely steric effect as in simulations of long charged stiff rods @xcite .",

    "the quadrupolar contribution becomes negative , which is caused by monopole - quadrupole image attractions , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , that are shorter ranged than @xmath144 . at even smaller separations quadrupole - quadrupole image repulsion ,",

    "instead a very strong correlation attraction is apparent at shorter separations .",
    "flexibility thus extends the range of attractive interactions as their nature changes from short range correlation attraction to longer ranged polyelectrolyte bridging .",

    "the quadrupolar contribution to the interaction pressure is attractive .    in the strong coupling limit",
    "higher order multipoles also play an important role in the intersurface interactions but only for a dielectrically inhomogeneous case . without any dielectric discontinuities in the system",
    "the higher multipoles simply do not matter in plan - parallel case and the monopolar part of the partition function captures all the strong coupling effects .",
    "this is a completely general result for plan - parallel surfaces and should be of some importance in assessing the electrostatically mediated forces between strongly charged planar surfaces .",
    "as already mentioned the multipoles can have effects near curved surfaces even without dielectric discontinuities .",
    "if compared to the case of monopolar counterions , higher multipoles interact only _ via _ the orientationally dependent part of the image self - interaction . in our analysis we focused on the counterions with monopolar and quadrupolar moments , so that the interaction is composed of three contributions .",
    "these are the monopole - monopole image interaction , which is long ranged and repulsive , the monopole - quadrupole image as well as quadrupole - monopole image interactions that are shorter range and attractive .",
    "finally , very short ranged quadrupole - quadrupole image contribution is repulsive and plays a dominant role at very small distances .",
