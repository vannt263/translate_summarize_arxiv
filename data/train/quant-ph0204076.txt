    "raman solitons_. we irradiate the system with an additional strong cw field @xmath227 , which couples the @xmath176 excited state with the @xmath228 metastable ground states . the fields @xmath227 and @xmath149 are largely detuned from the fast decaying excited states @xmath177 and @xmath178 by an amount @xmath229 .",
    "then , upon adiabatically eliminating the states @xmath177 and @xmath178 , we obtain that the rabi frequency @xmath199 of the control field in eq .",
    "( [ rabi_sit ] ) is simply replaced by @xmath230 .",
    "the lifetime of the sit soliton is given now by the lifetime of the @xmath228 ground states , which can be very large , reaching in some instances a fraction of a second !",
    "in addition , such a setup allows one to launch slow raman gss @xcite , and thus circumvent the difficulty of launching a standing ( zv ) or slowly moving gss , which must otherwise overcome the high reflectivity of the pc boundaries .",
    "in this paper we have focused on properties of solitons in a doped pc or rabr , combining a periodic refractive - index superlattice ( bragg reflector in 1d or 2d ) and a periodic set of thin active layers ( consisting of tlas _ resonantly _ interacting with the field ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that the system supports a vast family of bright gss , whose properties differ substantially from their counterparts in periodic structures with either cubic or quadratic _ off - resonant _ nonlinearities . depending on the initial conditions",
    ", these can be either standing ( zv ) or slowly moving stable solitons that exhibit sit irrespective of their photon number ( pulse energy ) for an appropriate group velocity . a multidimensional version of this model corresponds to a periodic set of thin active layers placed at the maxima of a 2d- or 3d - periodic refractive index .",
    "it has been found to support stable propagation of spatiotemporal solitons in the form of 2d- and 3d - localized lbs .",
    "the best prospect of realizing a pc which is adequate for observing the gss and lbs is to use thin layers of _ rare - earth ions _",
    "@xcite embedded in a spatially - periodic semiconductor structure @xcite .",
    "the tlas in the layers should be rare - earth - ions with the density of @xmath231 @xmath217 , and large transition dipole moments .",
    "the parameter @xmath134 can vary from 0 to 100 and the detuning is @xmath232 s@xmath145 .",
    "cryogenic conditions in such structures can strongly extend the dephasing time @xmath233 and thus the soliton s or lb s lifetime , well into the @xmath9sec range @xcite , which would greatly facilitate the experiment .    in a 2d pc",
    ", lbs can be envisaged to be localized on the time and transverse - length scales , respectively , @xmath234 s and @xmath235 m .",
    "the incident pulse has uniform transverse intensity and the transverse diffraction is strong enough .",
    "one needs @xmath236 , where @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the resonant - absorption length , carrier wavelength , and the pulse diameter , respectively . for @xmath240  m and @xmath241  m ,",
    "one thus requires @xmath242 m , which implies that the transverse size of the pc must be a few @xmath9 m .",
    "we have considered here ( sec . [",
    "sec : eit_sit][eit_sit ] ) the cross - coupling of optical beams in a pc or rabr .",
    "we have pointed out , for the first time , the advantageous features of the cross coupling between eit and sit pulses , which is capable of producing extremely strong correlations between the two pulses . with doping parameters as above , and driving and control fields with rabi frequencies of the order of @xmath243 rad / s , we can obtain a phase shift of @xmath186 for the weak probe pulse over a distance of few cm .",
    "this is much larger than any corresponding phase shift ( for similar control fields ) in other media .",
    "we strongly believe that the highly promising payoff expected from the construction of suitable structures justifies the experimental challenge they pose .",
    "if and when the schemes proposed above are experimentally realized , they may prove to be useful for producing ultrasensitive nonlinear phase shifters or logical photon switches for both classical and quantum information processing or communication , owing to the unique advantages of the doped pcs over conventional eit schemes @xcite or high - q cavities @xcite :",
