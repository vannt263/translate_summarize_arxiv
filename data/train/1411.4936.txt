    "s contributions to collisional stellar dynamics are found in less than 20 papers .",
    "all were published before 1976 , but represent almost half of the output in that early period of his research career . though   abandoned the field thereafter , his contributions were taken up again in subsequent decades by others , sometimes after a long gap .",
    "now they have become established as essential tools in the current vigorous exploration of the dynamical evolution of globular star clusters .    in this contribution",
    "we summarise   research under three headings , not in chronological order .",
    "the last in chronological order was the invention of the monte carlo method for the numerical simulation of the evolution , and we discuss this first .",
    "it also involves a couple of ideas which we recommend be used to commemorate   contributions : ``   units '' and ``   principle '' .",
    "then we turn to what was essentially   thesis work , on self - similar evolution .",
    "besides the self - similar models themselves , it is a seminal work , foreshadowing so much that was painfully rediscovered or refined by others in subsequent decades . finally we examine a topic to which   returned from time to time : the escape rate from a star cluster , especially an isolated one .",
    "this was a natural conclusion to his earliest collisional research , on the evaluation of diffusion coefficients , but that is the subject of another contribution in this volume .",
    "this was a subject which occupied   for about ten years .",
    "in fact monte carlo codes were invented independently by hnon , on the one hand , and by spitzer and his students on the other , in the years around 1970 , and their history is well summarised in @xcite .",
    "after   himself apparently stopped developing the method in the mid-1970s , there was a gap before it was taken up again and further developed by j. stodkiewicz in the 1980s .",
    "sadly stodkiewicz died in 1988 , but the ideas underlying his and   codes were faithfully developed from the 1990s by stodkiewicz s student m. giersz , working at camk in warsaw .",
    "the same thread of ideas was also adopted by a group at northwestern university under the leadership of f. rasio .",
    "this research programme has been pursued actively by both the us and the polish group ever since , and now have reached a quite comparable level of development . a version of giersz s code , though by no means the latest , can be found in the amuse software repository at amusecode.org , where it is referred to as _",
    "mmc_.      once   had thought of it , the basic idea of these monte carlo codes is quite simple .",
    "assuming that a stellar system is spherical and non - rotating , the dynamics of each star is represented by its ( specific ) energy @xmath0 and angular momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given random adjustments with the same statistical properties as those given by the theory of two - body relaxation ( including moments @xmath2 etc . ) in slightly greater detail ,",
    "the structure of the code is the following .    1 .",
    "select the overall time step @xmath3 , which for a code of   type is a fraction of a relaxation time ; 2 .   from the initial model ( king , plummer , etc ) , for each star assign radius @xmath4 ( distance from the cluster centre ) and @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   begin : 1 .",
    "order the stars by @xmath4 and compute the potential 2 .   for each successive pair of stars 1 .",
    "from @xmath5 compute radial and transverse components of velocity of both stars .",
    "( the orientation of the transverse component is randomised ) 2 .",
    "choose the impact parameter @xmath6 for an encounter so that the statistical effect of the encounter corresponds to the velocity changes predicted by the theory of relaxation for the time @xmath3 3 .",
    "compute the velocity components after the encounter , and the new @xmath0 and @xmath1 of both stars 4 .",
    "move each star to a random position ( radius ) on an orbit of energy @xmath0 and angular momentum @xmath1 4 .",
    "repeat    really , anyone with a knowledge of collisional stellar dynamics could use this outline to construct a simple monte carlo code in a few hours , except for a few tricky points , where   ingenuity shows the way . the shortest introduction to his approach",
    "is in , which are the same paper , or his saas - fee lectures @xcite , which also include a succinct account of the theory of two - body relaxation .",
    "here we summarise   solutions to these awkward points .",
    "the time step @xmath3 is of order the relaxation time , and each step takes of order @xmath49 operations ( because sorting of the radii is required , and computation of the potential at the new position of a star requires @xmath50 operations ) . thus the computational effort is of order @xmath49 per relaxation time , by contrast with , for example , a direct @xmath51-body simulation , where for a relatively homogeneous system the effort is of order @xmath52 per relaxation time @xcite .    , assuming constant mass - to - light ratio and mean stellar mass .",
    "the sloping lines represent systems requiring roughly the same computational effort with a modern monte carlo code , assuming the scaling given in the text .",
    "adjacent lines correspond to effort changing by a factor of 10 , and lines for 1 and 10 days are labelled .",
    "one caveat is that both @xmath53 and @xmath54 vary throughout the lifetime of the cluster , and it is assumed that the current values may be adopted . ]    clearly the monte carlo method wins for the range of @xmath51 corresponding to the globular star clusters . in fact",
    "any galactic globular cluster can be modelled in roughly 1 day ( fig.[fig : trhmmc ] ) , whereas with direct @xmath51-body methods the modelling of a given cluster for a hubble time is limited at present to @xmath55 stars .",
    "some of the merits and limitations of the monte carlo method are readily summarised .",
    "besides its relative efficiency , just mentioned , we have the fact that one can `` readily '' add stellar evolution , and dynamical interactions involving binaries .",
    "each required considerable effort in coding , but the job is done . of course , these are not advantages relative to the @xmath51-body method , but they do account for the fact that the monte carlo method leads the field among the fast methods for the simulation of dynamical evolution of rich star clusters",
    ".    among the difficulties of the monte carlo method is the modelling of the galactic tide .",
    "this has been steadily improved , but still @xmath51-body methods are needed for an adequate modelling of such features as the kinematics of escaping stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it also has to be assumed that the system is spherically symmetric and non - rotating .",
    "triples and higher - order multiples have to be ignored , though further development of the code could quite readily remove this limitation .",
    "because of the approximations involved , the monte carlo code has been repeatedly compared with the results of the virtually assumption - free @xmath51-body method , at least in the range of @xmath51 which the latter can reach .",
    "naturally the first of these studies was carried out by   himself .    at present the monte carlo method",
    "is the method of choice for all the large globular clusters of the galactic system , and has been applied to the modelling of the individual objects @xmath56 cen @xcite , m4 @xcite , ngc6397@xcite , 47 tuc @xcite and m22 @xcite .",
    "it is also being used to study such topics as the origin and distribution of blue stragglers @xcite .",
    "about 30 years ago this author tried to encourage the community to adopt a common system of units for its work , so that different studies could be more readily compared .",
    "it is defined by setting @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the constant of gravitation , @xmath59 is the total mass of the system , and @xmath60 is its virial radius . though some researchers find these units inconvenient for some reason or another , nevertheless they have been taken up widely , partly because major @xmath51-body and monte carlo codes adopt them , and perhaps also because they preserve the sense that simple @xmath51-body models ( i.e. without the accretion of stellar evolution and so on ) are scale - free . as a result the paper in which the author s recommendation appeared @xcite is ranked 5th by number of citations among this author s papers , even though the publication in which it appeared was almost unobtainable for a long time . furthermore the units were not even his idea , and so the paper s prominence has long been a source of mild embarrassment .    actually , @xmath51-body units originated in hnon s papers on the monte carlo method ( see especially )",
    "this fact was implicitly acknowledged in the author s paper , which did not even use the term _",
    "@xmath51-body units_. it seems to the author altogether appropriate to recommend that they be referred to in future as _",
    "units_.      this is another opportunity to commemorate , but the idea which he introduced is more profound than in the case of   units , important though those units are in practice .",
    "simple collisional stellar systems go through a process of core collapse , and for some time this was an impasse in the study of such systems . in the late 70s",
    "the fate of a star cluster _",
    "after _ core collapse seemed utterly conjectural .",
    "( see , for example , the introduction to @xcite . )    in 1974 , post - core - collapse evolution could not be simulated with a monte carlo code",
    ".  knew , from his thesis work ( sec.[sec : thesis ] ) , that binaries were the missing dynamical ingredient , but their introduction into the monte carlo code was only accomplished later @xcite .",
    "their role is to act as a `` heating '' source , giving kinetic energy to the stars with which they interact .",
    "realised , however , that the details of the heating were irrelevant , except for determining the parameters of the core .",
    "he argued that the core adjusts to produce the energy required for `` balanced evolution '' of the system as a whole : if the core is too small and dense , it produces too much energy , and expands , which reduces the energy production , while if the core is too large and dilute , it produces too little energy , and contracts , which increases the energy production",
    ".   also knew what the `` required '' energy was .",
    "it is the flux of energy from the centre in hnon s homological models ( see sec.[sec : thesis ] ) .",
    "this idea , that the core responds to the energy requirements of the cluster as a whole , can be referred to as `` hnon s principle '' .",
    "it is analogous to eddington s realisation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* especially ch 1.4 ) that one can predict the luminosity of a star even without knowing the nature of the source of stellar energy .",
    "principle has several important applications , and is one of the foundation stones of our understanding and simulation of the long - term evolution of star clusters . to allow a monte carlo model to pass through core collapse ,",
    "took the bold step @xcite of introducing a quite artificial energy - generating mechanism , affecting only the innermost particle in the model , but in a manner mimicking the behaviour of a real core .",
    "in this way core parameters will be wrong , but the overall evolution will be correct .",
    "the value of   principle extends well beyond the monte carlo model , however .",
    "it applies if the density - dependence of the energy - generating mechanism is high enough that almost all energy is generated in the core .",
    "for example , three - body binary formation gives a rate of energy generation proportional to @xmath61 per unit mass , where @xmath62 are the density and one - dimensional velocity dispersion , respectively ; from which   principle allows one to estimate the radius and density in the core of the cluster ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) . in a similar way",
    ", core parameters may be estimated in terms of the overall structure of the cluster ( total and mean particle mass , half - mass radius ) if the energy - generating mechanism is dynamical evolution of primordial binaries @xcite , stellar interactions with a central black hole @xcite , and perhaps even stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "we go back about 10 years to two papers which laid the groundwork for   principle , but also did much more @xcite .",
    "his principal aim was to solve the isotropised fokker - planck equation for the evolution of a star cluster , i.e. the equation    @xmath63 & ,        \\end{aligned } \\label{eqn : fpe}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 is the 1-particle distribution function , expressed as a function of particle energy @xmath0 and time @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the phase - space volume up to energy @xmath0 at time @xmath65 , @xmath67 denotes the energy - derivative @xmath68 , and the variable of integration appears in the forms @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    before tackling this formidable problem head - on ,",
    "examined it from several angles .",
    "first , assuming that the central density is finite , he computed one time step , and showed that the central density always increased .",
    "he inferred that solutions might have infinite central density .",
    "next , his review of the literature pointed out that previous work had either ( i ) neglected the collision term ( the right - hand side ) , and hence approximated the fokker - planck equation with the collisionless boltzmann equation ; or ( ii ) assumed a steady spatial structure ( e.g. a square well potential ) and solved the collisional evolution , thus neglecting a term on the left hand side",
    ".   asserted that _ all _ terms played a comparable role , and decided to search for self - similar ( or homological ) solutions .",
    "much later , lynden - bell explained why it is that self - similar solutions are of such importance and relevance in such problems @xcite .",
    "the point is quite subtle , but it least it is easy to see that the solving for such a solution simplifies the task a lot .",
    "even so ,   needed to bring his powerful technique and intuition to bear , especially with regard to the question of boundary conditions .",
    "deep in the cluster , he noted that the collision term , i.e. the right - hand side of eq.([eqn : fpe ] ) must nearly vanish . exploiting some simple freedom of scaling ,",
    "this implies that , to lowest order , the distribution function is a boltzmann distribution , i.e. @xmath71 . next he obtained an improved approximation ( still with the assumption that the collision term vanishes ) by posing @xmath72 . in this way he showed that @xmath73 and by examining the mass and energy of part of the system",
    ", he showed how the new terms could be interpreted : the term in @xmath74 corresponds to an energy flux at the centre ( @xmath75 ) , while the term in @xmath76 corresponds to a mass flux at @xmath75 .   knew that @xmath51-body simulations @xcite had already revealed the formation of energetic binaries . on such grounds   allowed @xmath74 to be non - zero in general , while he assumed that @xmath77 .",
    "thus conditions near the centre of the system are fixed .",
    "the earlier of the two papers we are discussing @xcite dealt with a star cluster immersed in the gravitational field of a parent galaxy , which fixed the boundary conditions at the outside .",
    "this left   with the task of solving an integrated form of the isotropised , self - similar fokker - planck equation , i.e. @xmath78 where @xmath79 is another constant to be determined , which arises from the time - dependent terms in eq.([eqn : fpe ] ) .",
    "this equation is equivalent to a fourth - order system .",
    "the inner boundary conditions are given by the expressions @xmath80 , and three similar expressions for the other three variables ; and the outer boundary conditions are @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 , since @xmath84 for @xmath85 , if the potential vanishes at the tidal boundary .",
    "( note that two of the four variables in the equivalent system are undetermined at the outside . )",
    "auxiliary equations to be evaluated or solved are for the density @xmath86 ; for the potential @xmath87 , i.e. poisson s equation @xmath88 where @xmath89 ; and the phase - space volume @xmath90 .",
    "given a fourth - order system with four unknowns ( the constants @xmath74 and @xmath79 , and two outer values ) , it is reasonable to suppose that an isolated solution might exist , and no doubt this is one reason why  chose to retain one of the terms in eq.([eqn : ibc ] ) .",
    "hnon s solution method was iterative :    1 .",
    "guess @xmath91 2 .",
    "do 1 .   compute @xmath92 2 .",
    "solve the fokker - planck equation for @xmath93 , and `` ttonner '' on @xmath94 to satisfy the outer boundary conditions .",
    "this gives new @xmath91 .",
    "3 .   until ( @xmath93 converges )",
    "remarkably enough the method did indeed converge .",
    "indeed the changes in the unknowns decreased by a factor of about 5 in each cycle of the main loop .",
    "the calculations were performed on an ibm 650 at meudon , and in 8 hours the solution was obtained with an estimated precision of 1 part in 1000 .   presented his results in the form of both graphs and tables , giving @xmath93 and the other useful functions obtained by his computations .",
    "table [ tab : henon1 ] gives the two essential unknown parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath79 , along with results from a recent study , still ongoing .",
    ".parameters of the homological models [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     note : some numerical constants in the relaxation time have been omitted .",
    "we suppose that the initial radius of a cluster is much less than its tidal radius",
    ". then the cluster expands ( much like   isolated model ) until its radius becomes comparable with the tidal radius .",
    "after that it evolves much like the tidally limited model .",
    "in fact it is possible to devise a unified model which smoothly goes over from one form of evolution to the other @xcite .",
    "the only modification we make is to assume that the evolution is faster than in   one component models , because a range of stellar masses is present in more realistic clusters . to illustrate the consequences of this model",
    ", we note that , in the first ( essentially isolated ) phase , the relaxation time behaves as @xmath95 ( table [ tab : time - dependence ] , noting the footnote there ) . if the cluster was initially very compact , @xmath96 , and so @xmath97 .",
    "finally , since all clusters have nearly the same age , it follows that all have the same relaxation time , of order their age .",
    "let us compare this result with the well known `` survival triangle '' , shown in fig.[fig : survival ] , which seeks to establish that the distribution of cluster parameters is restricted by the time scales on which various destruction mechanisms act @xcite .",
    "the usual interpretation of this diagram is that it shows that clusters are not found where the mechanisms of destruction would remove them within their lifetime . while most clusters sit comfortably inside the outermost contour in this diagram , they concentrate to the bottom left , where their distribution appears to be limited by destruction due to two - body relaxation .",
    "but one can perhaps better interpret the diagram as showing that most clusters have almost the same relaxation time , as predicted in the model of @xcite .    .",
    "at lower right the destruction time scale due to disk- and bulge - shocking becomes comparable with the clusters age ; at the top clusters would be destroyed by dynamical friction in the galaxy ; and at lower left destruction is dominated by two - body relaxation : the slope of the linear part of the outer contour corresponds to a line of constant relaxation time .",
    "the smooth corners of the triangle come from adding the destruction rates of the three processes , and different contours are obtained at different @xmath60.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : survival ]",
    "this section covers a topic which , unlike the foregoing , probably does not have any evident application to the star clusters .",
    "it is a question of `` pure '' stellar dynamics , but a loose end which   work did a lot to expose .",
    "it begins with his work on the diffusion coefficients in the theory of two - body relaxation ( see the contribution in this volume by f. namouni ) . a side - product of this work was an expression for the probability that , in time interval @xmath3 , a star experiences an encounter which changes its velocity from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , namely @xmath100 @xcite , where @xmath101 , @xmath102 are the stellar masses , and @xmath103 is the distribution of velocities",
    ".   quite rightly referred to `` le rsultat final , dune remarquable simplicit '' .",
    "indeed it is , by comparison with the intricacies of its derivation , but this author knows no simpler derivation than , and indeed the result seems unattainable if one does not follow his footsteps closely .    in the above paper , he used this result to obtain expressions for third - order moments of the velocity change @xmath104 , verifying the known result that these are smaller than the first and second moments ( i.e. those that appear in the fokker - planck equation ) by a factor of order the coulomb logarithm @xmath105 , where @xmath51 is the total number of stars .",
    "a second application of this result , obtained by integrating over speeds @xmath106 above the escape speed , and over all stars , is an expression for the rate of escape from an isolated stellar system , i.e. @xmath107 @xmath108 @xcite where we assume the potential @xmath109 as @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is the distribution function expressed as a function of energy @xmath0 . as a specific example",
    ",   calculated the result for a plummer model , obtaining the result @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the projected half - mass radius .",
    "this result has been checked by @xmath51-body simulations @xcite .  later extended this result to the case of a plummer model in which stars may have different masses .    an interesting point to note here",
    "is the absence of any coulomb logarithm .",
    "by contrast , most existing theories for the escape rate in an isolated system assumed that the part of the velocity distribution above the escape speed would be refilled on a relaxation time scale @xcite . in that case",
    "the coulomb logarithm @xmath105 appears in the numerator of the corresponding formula for the escape rate .",
    "a further contrast is with   isolated self - similar solution @xcite , where the escape rate is zero",
    ".   explained these contradictions by showing , in an appendix to the 1960 paper @xcite , that the escape rate would vanish in the diffusion picture on which the theory of relaxation is based .",
    "as the star approaches the escape energy , he argued , its orbital period tends to infinity , and the time it spends in the denser parts of the cluster , which is where relaxation is effective , becomes an ever smaller fraction of the period .",
    "thus relaxation stalls , explaining qualitatively why ambartsumian s argument fails , and why the rate of escape vanishes in the fokker - planck approximation .",
    "furthermore , the higher moments of energy changes , which are neglected in this approximation , are smaller by a factor of the order of @xmath105 , and so it is conceivable that these neglected terms could give rise to a non - zero escape rate , on a time scale longer than the relaxation time by a factor of order @xmath105 , as   found .",
    "there is one possibility for restoring the idea that escape takes place on the relaxation time scale , at least in the long term . after core collapse",
    ", an isolated cluster in expansion is powered by binaries , as we have discussed in sec.[sec : henon1961 ] .",
    "the rate of energy generation is @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the central potential @xcite .",
    "then `` hnon s principle '' ( sec.[sec : principle ] ) shows that @xmath116 , where now @xmath117 is the total energy of the cluster , and so @xmath118 .",
    "this is not inconsistent with   argument that the escape rate vanishes in the fokker - planck approximation , as the processes of binary formation and hardening are not included in this equation .",
    "one would have thought that numerical experiments would have settled these questions , if indeed questions remain .",
    "unfortunately they themselves raise fresh questions .",
    "simulations of enormous length are needed , because the escape rate from an isolated system is so low , and the expansion after core collapse slows down all dynamical processes .",
    "the expansion also speeds up numerical simulations , however , and a series of such simulations was carried out by h. baumgardt @xcite for @xmath51 up to a relatively modest 8192 particles , but the longest runs covered no less than about @xmath119   units ( fig.[fig : baumgardt ] ) .",
    "-body models.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : baumgardt ]    fig.[fig : baumgardt ] looks quite at odds with any of the foregoing theoretical discussion , as it seems that all systems lose about 75% of their mass in the same time , independent of @xmath51 .",
    "but two things contribute here : escape of stars , of course , but also the post - collapse expansion , which controls all the time scales .",
    "the result in this figure could be understood qualitatively if the large-@xmath51 systems expand more slowly ( with reference to the relaxation time ) than small-@xmath51 systems . then they spend a larger time at radii where the escape rate is larger .",
    "indeed baumgardt et al find that this is the case , and suggest that the reason for this is that the clusters of different @xmath51 are not exactly scaled versions of each other .",
    "it is known , for example @xcite , that the core radius is relatively smaller for larger @xmath51 in steady post - collapse evolution .",
    "also , baumgardt et al point out that there are other escape mechanisms beyond the two - body process discussed by @xcite and the three - body process discussed above .",
    "lightly bound outlying stars can become unbound because of the recoil of the cluster due to escapers resulting from the processes already mentioned .",
    "in addition , these slightly bound outlying stars can escape because the potential well in which they sit becomes shallower , because of escape by any of the other processes already noted .",
    "this problem of escape from an isolated cluster , which initially seems so simple , raises a number of tricky questions . in principle",
    "some of them could be answered by studying simulations , provided that there are not systematic ( @xmath51-dependent ) errors in the latter .",
    "certainly there is something to be understood , because the result of fig.[fig : baumgardt ] can not continue for arbitrarily large @xmath51 ; the duration of the first part of the curve appears to be approximately proportional to @xmath51 , and for large enough @xmath51 the curve could not then drop steeply enough to cross the approximate common intersection point of the curves shown .      when a star cluster moves on a circular galactic orbit , it is immersed in the tidal field of the galaxy , and the basic issues of escape seem clearer .   1961 homological model ( sec.[sec : henon1961 ] )",
    "loses mass on the time scale of the relaxation time , though the tidal radius was treated as a cut - off , and the effect of the tidal field on members of the cluster , or on escapers , was ignored .",
    "if the tidal field is properly modelled @xcite , the tidal field and inertial forces enter into the equations of motion .",
    "in fact the equations resemble those of hill s problem in celestial mechanics , a subject which   also studied as part of his work on ( mostly periodic ) orbits .",
    "he was well aware of the possible implications for star clusters .",
    "in particular , there is a family , family @xmath29 , of periodic orbits ( fig.[fig : hillpo ] ) which , at large distance from the cluster , are essentially epicycles governed by the tidal and inertial forces . the cluster acceleration is a perturbation , which actually acts to make the orbits stable",
    ".   noted that a cluster could be surrounded by such orbits , though he expressed some doubt whether they could be occupied by cluster members in the normal course of cluster evolution .",
    "increases to the left , and the ordinate is the coordinate , on the axis pointing to the centre of the galaxy , where an orbit cuts this axis .",
    "the potential well is represented by the two bulges at upper right , with the lagrange points l@xmath120 at largest @xmath121 .",
    "the `` characteristic curve '' of family @xmath29 of periodic orbits extends from lower left , surrounded by the zone of quasi - periodic orbits .",
    "they enter the physical extent of the cluster at about the middle of the diagram , but with an energy below the escape energy when the family passes the energy of the lagrange points.,title=\"fig:\"][fig : hillpo ]    this family continues at lower `` energies '' ( actually , lower jacobi constant ) , and eventually is located _ inside the cluster _ , even though the energy is still above the energy of escape . in recent years such stars",
    "have become known as _ potential escapers _",
    ", though they could only every become escapers as a result of gravitational encounters , or because the potential well of the cluster changes by other processes .",
    "these potential escapers can become a significant population , amounting to 10% for @xmath122 , and decreasing with @xmath51 only as @xmath123 @xcite , so that they represent several percent even for real star clusters , provided that the approximation of a circular galactic orbit is adequate .",
    "the presence of potential escapers has some notable effects .",
    "first , models of star clusters never include this population , and it is not known how this affects inferences made on the basis of such models ( e.g. estimates of the total mass ) .",
    "it may well be that potential escapers would look like stars with speeds above the escape speed , if compared with a model in which such stars are ignored .",
    "certainly , they have an important role in shaping the velocity dispersion profile near the tidal radius @xcite .",
    "more indirectly , they also act as a buffer between bound members ( inside the cluster , and with energies below the escape energy ) and escapers , altering the time scale of escape from about the relaxation time scale @xmath124 to roughly @xmath125 @xcite , for clusters filling the roche lobe ( bounded by the lagrange points ) .    where the problem of escape still leaves the most tricky theoretical questions is the case of clusters on oval galactic orbits .",
    "apparently , such clusters lose stars at about the same rate as a cluster on a circular orbit at some intermediate radius between the apo- and pericentres of its galactic orbit , at least when the eccentricity of the orbit is not very large , and that the time scale of escape varies with @xmath51 and @xmath124 in the same way @xcite .",
    "but a theoretical understanding of this problem is lacking .",
    "i met   at several conferences ( fig.[fig : henon ] ) , but in 1975 i also had the privilege of being hosted by him in my first foreign postdoc .",
    "for someone with little french this might have been a challenge , and indeed during the spirited and noisy lunches at the nice observatory it was .",
    "but michel s english was excellent , and scientific exchange with him was straightforward .",
