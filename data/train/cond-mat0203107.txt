    "the mechanism of the normal - state charge transport remains to be one of the central issues in the studies of the high-@xmath13 cuprates , because it is intimately tied to the peculiarities of the strongly - correlated electron system in which the high-@xmath13 superconductivity is realized .",
    "the contrasting behavior between the in - plane resistivity @xmath0 and the @xmath9-axis resistivity @xmath1 is arguably the most unusual property of the charge transport in the cuprates ( ref . ) ; namely , there is an intriguing coexistence of a metallic behavior in @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and an  insulating \" ( or semiconducting ) behavior in @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) in many cuprates , @xcite and such an unusual nature of the anisotropic charge transport appears to offer a key to understand the charge transport mechanism .",
    "in fact , already a large amount of works have been concentrated on this issue .",
    "@xcite probably the most important feature in the @xmath9-axis transport is that the magnitude of @xmath18 is orders of magnitude larger than that expected from the band - structure estimate @xcite ; this indicates that there is some  charge confinement \" mechanism @xcite that renormalizes the @xmath9-axis hopping rate to a much smaller value .",
    "it has been argued that such  confinement \" gives evidence for a non - fermi - liquid nature of the cuprates , @xcite and the persistence of the contrasting behavior between @xmath14 and @xmath18 down to very low temperature @xcite does indeed suggest that some unconventional mechanism is responsible for the charge confinement , since any fermi - liquid - based mechanism that provides an apparent confinement at finite temperatures should saturate at low enough temperature . @xcite    while it is likely that some unconventional mechanism ( possibly a non - fermi - liquid ground state ) is fundamentally responsible for the confinement of charges into the cuo@xmath19 planes ( i.e. renormalization of the @xmath9-axis hopping rate ) , recent studies have shown @xcite that a combination of the pseudogap and the @xmath20-dependence of the @xmath9-axis matrix element @xcite is largely responsible for the steeply insulating behavior of @xmath18 observed , in particular , in bi@xmath19sr@xmath19cacu@xmath19o@xmath21 ( bi-2212 ) ; namely , the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements of bi-2212 have demonstrated @xcite that the pseudogap causes destruction of the fermi surface starting from the @xmath22 and @xmath23 points , and the @xmath9-axis matrix - element effect @xcite tends to amplify the contribution of the electrons on these gapped portions of the fermi surface to the @xmath9-axis transport . as a result , the @xmath9-axis conductivity is quickly diminished upon opening of the pseudogap ; the steep upturn in @xmath18 observed in yba@xmath19cu@xmath24o@xmath25 ( ybco),@xcite bi-2212,@xcite and bi@xmath19sr@xmath19cuo@xmath26 ( bi-2201 ) @xcite below the pseudogap temperature is considered to be due to this mechanism . on the other hand , it has been shown by the arpes measurements that the fermi surface of the la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( lsco ) system appears to be quite different from that of bi-2212 ( the stripe fluctuations cause the fermi surface to be one - dimensional ( 1d ) like @xcite ) , and it is not likely that the pseudogap shows a similar development on the fermi surface of the lsco ; therefore it would be illuminating to examine the @xmath9-axis transport of lsco , particularly in the underdoped region , and compare it with that of other cuprate systems .    in the past",
    ", the @xmath9-axis transport in lsco has already been rather well studied through various techniques , such as resistivity , @xcite magnetoresistance , @xcite microwaves , @xcite and optics .",
    "@xcite this is partly because large single crystals can be grown with the traveling - solvent floating - zone ( tsfz ) technique for lsco and thus it is easy to obtain samples that are long enough along the @xmath9-axis to allow reliable @xmath9-axis transport measurements .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that @xmath18 in slightly underdoped samples ( @xmath27 ) shows only a weak temperature dependence at moderate temperatures ( @xmath28 k ) , particularly after correcting for the thermal expansion , @xcite which is in contrast to the behaviors of @xmath18 of bi-2212 or bi-2201 , @xcite where the pseudogap causes @xmath18 to become steeply insulating .",
    "the magnetoresistance study by hussey _",
    "@xcite has shown that the @xmath9-axis transport of lsco is incoherent and @xmath1 is governed in a large part by the in - plane scattering rate .",
    "the low - temperature normal - state behavior of @xmath18 in lsco has been found to track the behavior of @xmath0 , namely , both @xmath14 and @xmath18 for @xmath29 show a peculiar localizing behavior with the same temperature dependence of @xmath30 ( refs . ) ; this seems to be in good accord with the magnetoresistance result of hussey _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite which suggests that the strong in - plane scattering can cause the carriers to localize in both the @xmath31 and @xmath9 directions",
    ".    however , all the @xmath9-axis transport studies that used the tsfz - grown single crystals have been limited to the region with @xmath32 , and thus it is important to expand the region of @xmath10 to smaller values , down to the lightly - doped region , to establish a complete picture of the @xmath9-axis transport in lsco .",
    "since we have recently succeeded in growing a series of high - quality single crystals of lsco from @xmath10 = 0.01 to 0.17 and have measured their in - plane transport properties , @xcite it is natural for us to study the @xmath9-axis transport using those high - quality single crystals .",
    "[ there were studies of the transport properties of flux - grown la@xmath19cuo@xmath33 single crystals in the antiferromagnetic regime , @xcite but the data are inconsistent with the present study ( for @xmath1 ) and with ref .",
    "( for @xmath0 ) .",
    "] studies of the @xmath9-axis transport in the lightly - doped lsco would be particularly useful for clarifying the mechanism of the @xmath9-axis transport , in view of the unusually metallic behavior of the in - plane mobility which suggests that the holes are likely to form a self - organized network of hole - rich regions where a band - like metallic transport occurs .",
    "@xcite ( such a phase has been theoretically predicted to be realized in correlated electron systems and was named  electronic liquid crystal \" .",
    "@xcite ) also , recent arpes measurements @xcite have provided information on the fermi surfaces of lightly - doped lsco , which is useful in interpreting the transport data .    in this paper",
    ", we detail our technique to grow high - quality lsco single crystals and present the @xmath9-axis transport data taken on the crystals with @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath14 data for the same compositions are also presented for the analysis of the resistivity anisotropy .",
    "it is found that the resistivity anisotropy ratio @xmath11 at moderate temperatures becomes almost independent of @xmath10 in the lightly - doped region ; this is contrary to the common belief that the resistivity anisotropy should increase with decreasing doping and thus is a surprising result .",
    "we discuss that this striking @xmath10-independence of @xmath11 is consistent with the idea that holes are segregated into a network of hole - rich regions and that the @xmath9-axis transport is essentially an incoherent hopping between these self - organized networks , in which the strength of the  confinement \" does not change with @xmath10 .",
    "the series of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath35 single crystals ( @xmath36 ) are grown by the tsfz technique .",
    "raw powders of la@xmath19o@xmath24 , srco@xmath24 , and cuo ( with purities of 99.9% or higher ) are dried at 600@xmath37c for 12 hours prior to weighing , and then are weighed and mixed with a composition in which cuo is @xmath38% richer than the nominal one ; the additional cuo works as a binder of the polycrystalline feed - rod and helps avoiding the occurrence of cracks in the rod , as well as avoiding penetration of the molten liquid into it , during the tsfz operation .",
    "also , since the vapor pressure of cuo during the growth is relatively high and thus the resulting crystals should have smaller cu content compared to the starting material , the excess cuo in the feed - rod compensates the cu loss and is necessary to obtain stoichiometric single crystals as the final product .",
    "the mixture of raw powders is well ground and calcined at 750@xmath37c for 12 hours , then at 920@xmath37c for 12 hours for 4 times in alumina crucibles with regrinding between each calcination .",
    "after the last calcination and regrinding , the powders are isostatically pressed into a rod shape with typical dimensions of 7 mm@xmath39 150 mm , and finally sintered at 1200@xmath37c for 15 hours in air to form the feed - rod .",
    "calcination and regrinding for more than 4 times before the final sintering make the polycrystalline materials highly homogeneous , and this homogeneity is important for the sintered feed - rod to become dense and hard , which ensures the molten zone to be well stabilized during the tsfz operation .    the solvent material , which is used to lower the temperature of the molten zone , is prepared to have the cation ratio of @xmath40 for each @xmath10 .",
    "we use 0.5 g of the solvent for the tsfz growth .",
    "the tsfz operation is carried out using an infrared image furnace ( nec machinery sc k-15hd ) with two halogen lamps and double ellipsoidal mirrors in the atmosphere of flowing dried air . to cut off reflections of the light from high angles , a quartz tube ( which encloses the moving rods )",
    "is partly covered with aluminum foils to make a narrow window ; this sharpens the temperature profile and helps stabilizing the molten zone .",
    "@xcite use of a seed crystal helps the whole rod to become a single crystal .",
    "the growth rate is kept constant at 1.0 mm / h ( or less ) . a photograph of our tsfz - grown crystal with @xmath10=0.04 is shown in fig .",

    "the crystallographic axes are precisely determined by the x - ray back - reflection laue method , which also reveals that the typical growth direction is @xmath42110@xmath43 $ ] ( in the notation of high - temperature tetragonal phase ) .",
    "the samples for the present measurements are shaped into thin platelets with typical dimensions of 2.0 @xmath44 0.5 @xmath44 0.2 mm@xmath45 , with the wide faces exactly parallel to the @xmath31 ( @xmath46 ) planes within an error of 1@xmath41 for the in - plane ( out - of - plane ) measurements .",
    "the samples with @xmath47 are carefully annealed in pure ar gas at 400@xmath37c for 20 hours to remove excess oxygen .",
    "it should be noted that in the lightly - doped region the transport properties are strongly affected by the excess oxygen ; even a slight amount of excess oxygen can easily cause phase - separated oxygen - rich regions which show superconductivity .",
    "( many of the early data of lightly - doped lsco , like those of ref .",
    ", are actually contaminated by the superconductivity caused by the excess oxygen . )",
    "we have examined various annealing conditions and found that annealing at higher temperature and/or for longer time in pure ar does not change the resistivity any more ; therefore , we have concluded that the above annealing is sufficient to get rid of the excess oxygen while minimizing the possible decomposition . on the other hand ,",
    "the samples with @xmath10 = 0.08 and 0.10 are annealed at 800@xmath37c for 40 hours in air , followed by rapid quenching to room temperature , to remove oxygen defects @xcite that cause additional electron scattering in moderately - doped and overdoped samples .",
    "the in - plane and out - of - plane resistivities ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) are measured using a standard ac four - probe method .",
    "note that , since we can obtain samples that are long along the @xmath9-axis , we do not need to use a complicated technique , such as the montgomery method , for the @xmath1 measurement in the case of lsco .",
    "the contact pads are hand - drawn on polished sample surfaces with gold paint , followed by a heat treatment at 400@xmath37c for 30 minutes in air , which makes the gold particles to well adhere to the crystal surface [ the high - temperature annealing to remove excess oxygen ( or oxygen defects ) are done after this process ] .",
    "for the current contacts , the whole area of two opposing side faces is painted with gold to ensure uniform current flow through the sample .",
    "after the annealing , thin gold wires are attached to the contact pads using silver epoxy , which electrically and mechanically binds the wire to the sample ; the contact resistance with this technique is less than 1 @xmath50 .",
    "the photographs in figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) show the geometry of the contacts and how the leads are attached .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is minimized by using relatively long samples ( at least 2 mm long ) and by painting narrow contact pads with a width of @xmath51 @xmath52 m ; total errors in the absolute values are less than 10% .",
    "we note that , although the measurements employ a simple four - probe method , each sample has four voltage contacts ( two on each side face ) and the resistivity is measured using both pairs [ see fig .",
    "sometimes the resistivity values from the two voltage pairs do not agree , which is an indication of some inhomogeneity ( or microcrack ) in the sample ; we reject the data when such a discrepancy is observed , and all the data shown here are measured on samples for which the two data sets match within 5% .",
    "we also confirm that the resistivity data measured on different pieces of crystals from the same batch are reproducible within 10% as long as the samples are free from inhomogeneity .",
    "of the lsco single crystals with @xmath10 = 0.01  0.10.,width=321 ]    figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of @xmath48 of our crystals with the vertical axis in the logarithmic scale ; this figure is essentially a partial reproduction of the data from ref .",
    ", except for the @xmath10=0.10 data that are new .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath48 is among the smallest ever reported @xcite for each @xmath10 .",
    "this fact , together with the very sharp x - ray rocking curve , indicates that the single crystals studied here are of very high quality . as was emphasized in ref .",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is metallic ( @xmath53 ) at moderate temperatures even in the samples where @xmath48 exceeds 2 m@xmath50 cm , which corresponds to @xmath54 value @xcite of less than 1 , and thus the mott - ioffe - regel limit for metallic transport is strongly violated ; we have argued @xcite that this behavior , in combination with the mobility that is only weakly doping - dependent , is best understood to result from a self - organized network of hole - rich regions that constitute the path for the charge transport .",
    "figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath49 for the same doping range . in the @xmath55 profile of lsco , a clear kink",
    "is usually observed at the structural phase transition temperature from the high - temperature tetragonal ( htt ) phase to the low - temperature orthorhombic ( lto ) phase @xcite ; for all the compositions of the present study , however , the structural phase transition occurs at temperatures higher than 300 k ( ref . ) , except for the @xmath10=0.10 sample which show the lto transition at 293 k. we note that the data for @xmath10=0.01 show a kink at 240 k , which corresponds to the nel temperature @xmath56 and not to the lto transition temperature .",
    "( the kink in the @xmath18 curves at @xmath56 has been reported @xcite for antiferromagnetic ybco , but not for lsco before . )",
    "it is useful to note that , although @xmath49 increases with decreasing temperature in all the samples , the temperature dependence of @xmath49 is rather weak at moderate temperatures ( for example , @xmath49 of the @xmath10=0.02 sample shows only a factor of 2 increase from 300 k to 50 k ) , and a negative curvature ( @xmath57 ) is observed in the @xmath18 profile for @xmath10 = 0.02 and 0.03 at temperatures above 100 k ( which can be seen in fig .",
    "this negative curvature is in sharp contrast to the steeply positive curvature of @xmath18 of bi-2212 ( ref . ) or bi-2201 ( ref . ) below the pseudogap temperature . at lower temperatures below 50 k ,",
    "the @xmath18 curves of all the samples show strongly diverging behavior , which is in clear correspondence with the localization behavior in @xmath14 at low temperatures ( except for the @xmath10=0.08 and 0.10 samples whose @xmath14 curves show an insulating behavior only when the superconductivity is suppressed by a high magnetic field @xcite ) .     of the lsco single crystals with @xmath34 .",
    "the arrow marks a kink at the nel temperature for @xmath10=0.01.,width=321 ]    an intriguing aspect of the @xmath55 data is that their profile does not change much with @xmath10 ( namely , the @xmath55 data are almost parallel - shifted for different @xmath10 ) at moderate temperatures , as is the case with the @xmath58 data . to examine the doping dependence of the @xmath55 in detail",
    ", we plot the temperature dependences of @xmath59 , which corresponds to the inverse mobility @xmath60 of the doped holes along the @xmath9-axis , where @xmath61 is the electronic charge and @xmath62 is the nominal hole concentration given by @xmath63 ( unit cell volume @xmath64 is 3.8@xmath443.8@xmath4413.2 @xmath45 ) , as we did for @xmath14 in ref . .",
    "as is shown in fig .",
    "4 , the absolute magnitude of @xmath59 at 300 k changes only by @xmath6540% in the non - superconducting regime ( from @xmath10 = 0.01 to 0.05 ) , although it starts to change quickly in the superconducting regime ( above @xmath10=0.05 ) .",
    "the weak @xmath10-dependence of @xmath59 at 300 k in the non - superconducting regime is rather similar to the behavior of the inverse in - plane mobility @xmath66 that also changes only by @xmath6540% from @xmath10 = 0.01 to 0.05 ( ref . ) .    , which corresponds to the inverse mobility of the doped holes along the @xmath9-axis , for @xmath10 = 0.01  0.10.,width=321 ]    the most surprising feature we find in this work is that @xmath6 at moderate temperatures is almost completely independent of doping in the non - superconducting regime ( @xmath8 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "when @xmath10 exceeds 0.05 and enters into the superconducting regime , @xmath6 starts to become smaller with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "( the implication of this result is discussed in detail in the next section . ) also , all the samples in fig . 5 show strongly temperature - dependent @xmath6 , and in the non - superconducting samples ( @xmath67 ) there is a peak that moves systematically to higher temperature with decreasing @xmath10 .",
    "when one compares fig .",
    "2 , it becomes clear that the peak temperature of the anisotropy corresponds to the onset of the insulating behavior in @xmath14 ; namely , the decrease of @xmath6 with decreasing temperature is determined by the rapid increase in @xmath0 .",
    "the occurrence of the peak in @xmath6 means that the strong localization of the carriers causes @xmath0 to diverge more rapidly than @xmath68 , and as a result the system becomes less two - dimensional in the strongly localized state ; this can be rephrased that the strong localization causes the system to become a  three - dimensional \" insulator where the carriers can not move to any direction .     for @xmath10 = 0.01  0.10.,width=321 ]",
    "it is worth noting that it is _ not _ the establishment of the long - range antiferromagnetic order but the strong localization effect that cause @xmath6 to decrease ; in this regard , our result disagrees with the interpretation of kitajima _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the @xmath6 behavior of insulating bi@xmath19sr@xmath19ercu@xmath19o@xmath69 .",
    "our sample with @xmath10=0.01 clearly shows that @xmath6 keeps increasing with decreasing temperature ( which means that the charge confinement becomes increasingly effective ) even below the nel temperature until the carriers start to localize .",
    "as is seen in fig .",
    "3 , the temperature dependence of @xmath1 at moderate temperatures ( @xmath7 k ) is weak for @xmath70 , which is in contrast to the @xmath18 behaviors of bi-2212 or bi-2201 where @xmath18 shows a steep upturn below the pseudogap temperature [ a steep upturn in @xmath18 of lsco is only observed at low temperature ( below @xmath6550",
    "k ) , which is most likely to be associated with the strong localization ] .",
    "since the @xmath9-axis transport in any cuprate should necessarily reflect the @xmath9-axis matrix element that tends to amplify the development of the pseudogap with a @xmath71 symmetry , the @xmath18 behavior of underdoped lsco means either that the pseudogap is already fully developed at 300 k , or that the pseudogap has a symmetry different from @xmath71 .",
    "( the photoemission experiment has observed a pseudogap in lsco only in the angle - integrated mode , and the temperature evolution was not studied @xcite ) .",
    "note also that the published arpes results to date have reported @xcite that the fermi surface in the underdoped lsco is observed only near the @xmath23 , @xmath22 points ( 1d - like fermi surface ) , which is incompatible with the concept of the pseudogap with a @xmath71 symmetry ; this fact might also be related to the weak temperature dependence of @xmath1 at moderate temperatures .",
    "( it should be noted , however , that very recent arpes measurements of the lightly - doped lsco have succeeded in observing a developing band at the nodal points , @xcite so the picture of the fermi surface of lsco is not finalized yet . ) in any case , we expect that future arpes measurements will help understanding the behavior of @xmath18 in lsco .",
    "the most illuminating observation is that the resistivity anisotropy @xmath11 near room temperature is almost independent of @xmath10 for @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in this @xmath10-independent regime",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath11 is @xmath651000 at 300 k and increases with decreasing temperature , which indicates that the same charge confinement mechanism is at work down to @xmath10=0.01 ; interestingly , this range of @xmath10 ( 0.01  0.05 ) corresponds to the region where the neutron experiments have found diagonal spin stripes .",
    "@xcite as was already mentioned in the previous section , the metallic in - plane transport that violates the mott - ioffe - regel limit suggests @xcite that the transport is occurring through a self - organized network of hole - rich regions @xcite that constitute the path for the charge transport .",
    "the striking @xmath10-independence of @xmath11 is naturally understood in this picture of transport through a self - organized network , because in such a case the transport anisotropy is determined by the local electronic nature of the hole - rich segment that is presumably unchanged with @xmath10 ( only the average distance between the hole - rich paths changes with @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , the behavior of @xmath11 in the lightly - doped region is consistent with the self - organized - network picture and gives strong support to it .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath9-axis mobility , as well as the @xmath11 ratio , quickly changes when @xmath10 enters into the superconducting regime . as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , @xmath59 at 300 k changes by a factor of 3 from @xmath10=0.05 to 0.10 , which indicates that the @xmath9-axis hopping quickly becomes easier as @xmath10 is increased above 0.05 .",
    "correspondingly , the anisotropy ratio at moderate temperatures starts to show a decrease above @xmath10=0.05 , which means that the charges are increasingly less confined in this doping range .",
    "this sharp change in the @xmath9-axis transport properties across @xmath10=0.05 is in contrast to the smooth change of the in - plane transport properties , where the mobility at 300 k changes very smoothly as @xmath72 ( ref . ) , neglecting the superconductor - to - insulator transition that occurs at low temperature . as we discussed in ref .",
    ", the fact that the in - plane mobility changes slowly and smoothly and is governed by a simple function of @xmath10 from @xmath10 = 0.01 to 0.17 strongly suggests that the mechanism of the in - plane charge transport is essentially unchanged from the antiferromagnetic regime to optimum doping ; since the transport in the antiferromagnetic regime is likely to be governed by a self - organized network ( which can be interpreted to be a generalized version of the  stripes \" @xcite ) , the charge transport in the whole phase diagram up to optimum doping appears to be governed by such an electron self - organization , which also gives a natural picture for the charge confinement .",
    "the difference in the @xmath10 dependence between @xmath73 and @xmath74 probably indicates that the @xmath9-axis coupling ( or correlation ) between the two - dimensional networks is more susceptible to the change in @xmath10 than the properties of the network itself .",
    "it is intriguing to note that the emergence and increase of @xmath13 appear to be related to an increase in the @xmath9-axis coupling between the self - organized network .",
    "the @xmath31- and @xmath9-axis resistivities are measured in the lightly- to moderately - doped lsco single crystals and the resistivity anisotropy is analyzed to sort out the transport mechanism of this prototype cuprate . at moderate temperatures ,",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath49 in the underdoped lsco is much weaker than that of underdoped bi-2212 or bi-2201 ; we discuss that this difference in the @xmath18 behavior is related to the differences in both the fermi - surface topology and the way how the pseudogap develops on the fermi surface .",
    "moreover , we found that @xmath6 near room temperature is almost completely independent of doping for @xmath8 .",
    "this result supports the picture that the holes form a self - organized network of hole - rich path , which was originally suggested @xcite from the unusually metallic in - plane transport of the holes in the lightly - doped region ; in this picture , it is understood that the band - like in - plane transport takes place through the self - organized network , while the @xmath9-axis transport is essentially an incoherent hopping between the networks , in which the strength of the confinement does not change with @xmath10 in the lightly - doped region .",
