    "the understanding of the gauge - gravity duality or the anti  de - sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for an earlier review ) has provided us with a large class of strongly coupled large @xmath8 gauge theories .",
    "the very nature of this duality enables us to perform computations in classical general relativity which  when translated to the gauge theory language _ via _ the ads / cft dictionary  corresponds to a computation in the dual field theory in the strong coupling limit .",
    "this is a remarkably powerful technique to probe aspects of strongly coupled gauge theories where conventional perturbative field theory methods are severely inadequate .",
    "strongly coupled systems are abundant in nature : the physics of the strong interaction described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , as suggested by its name , describes a strongly coupled system .",
    "coincidentally we live in an interesting time when the strong - coupling physics of qcd has been experimentally explored in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and is being currently explored in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ; see _ e.g. _  @xcite for more information about experimental results and findings .",
    "these explorations and findings necessitate improved theoretical control in addressing strong coupling physics .",
    "this is where the ads / cft correspondence makes her entrance .",
    "currently we do not have a gravitational dual to qcd in a precise sense .",
    "however , within this class of large @xmath8 gauge theories , the strongly coupled dynamics of the  quarks \" and the  gluons \" can be explored and understood .",
    "such theories are typically supersymmetric and conformal with adjoint matter fields ( @xmath9  gluons \" ) , and in addition fundamental matter ( @xmath9  quarks \" ) can be introduced .",
    "the hope is that by studying these theories , we can learn general lessons about universal features of strongly coupled systems that also apply  at least qualitatively  to qcd .    in this article",
    ", our focus will be both on the fundamental flavor sector and its back - reaction on the adjoint sector .",
    "typically the fundamental matter fields are introduced by considering @xmath10 number of flavor branes in the background of @xmath8 color branes .",
    "the stack of color branes gives rise to a gravitational background which can be obtained by solving the supergravity equations of motion . in this background",
    "the flavor branes are introduced in the probe limit , with @xmath11 , such that they do not back - react on the background .",
    "this idea was pioneered in @xcite .",
    "many interesting physical questions can be explored and understood in the flavor sector within this probe limit and within various models , _",
    "e.g. _  the meson spectrum and the meson melting phase transition respectively in @xcite and @xcite in the d3-d7 model .",
    "another canonical example is the physics of the chiral symmetry breaking within the flavor sector realized in _",
    "e.g. _  the so called sakai - sugimoto model @xcite and its finite temperature version in @xcite ; and more recent models of chiral symmetry breaking in @xcite .",
    "all these analyses are performed within the probe limit where it is assumed that the number of flavors is very small compared to the number of colors . in qcd , however , this is not the case .",
    "first we have @xmath12 and thus large @xmath8 gauge theories will not work as a good quantitative approximation and we may only hope for robust qualitative features .",
    "second , we have @xmath13 ; hence the physics that we observe in the strict probe limit may also be of limiting use .",
    "one may wonder how much the qualitative physics can really depend on the precise values of @xmath10 and @xmath8 and their relative strength .",
    "it certainly depends on the precise physical question , however we can identify certain physical properties that crucially depend on these values .",
    "one such example is the qcd beta function : it can be shown that qcd is an asymptotically free theory as long as @xmath14 , which holds true in nature .",
    "however , the physics will be completely different if the above inequality is not satisfied .",
    "another crucial property is chiral symmetry breaking where the physics of the chiral transition depends on @xmath8 and @xmath10 leading to a phase structure which is sensitive to these numbers ( at least on their ballpark ranges ) .",
    "thus we can safely conclude that going beyond the probe limit , as far as introducing flavor degrees of freedom is concerned , is a rather important topic to explore .",
    "the general procedure to consider back - reaction consists of the following steps : we start with a background obtained by solving the supergravity equations of motion , _",
    "e.g. _  an ads@xmath15 background , where @xmath16 is some sasaki - einstein manifold .",
    "this gravitational background is obtained from the closed string sector .",
    "the dual field theory is some @xmath17 superconformal quiver gauge theory with a certain global symmetry group which is identified with the isometry group of the internal manifold . to introduce flavors , we need to add open string degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics of the open string degrees of freedom is described by the probe d - brane action of appropriate dimension and is given by the so - called dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action ( supplemented by the wess - zumino term whenever necessary ) . to consider the back - reaction we need to consider the dbi action as the matter source that deforms the original background .",
    "work along this direction has been undertaken by several authors over the years beginning with _",
    "@xcite and nicely summarized in @xcite .",
    "these references have analyzed the back - reaction by supersymmetric probes at zero temperature .",
    "supersymmetry makes the problem more tractable since one does not need to solve the equations of motion , but instead it is sufficient to solve first order bps equations .",
    "this technical simplification comes at the cost that the resulting theory  even after the inclusion of the flavor degrees of freedom  is supersymmetric and does not realize the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry as one would expect in qcd .",
    "nonetheless , numerous interesting features have been explored within this type of models at zero and finite temperature and more recently including other parameters , such as a chemical potential or an external electromagnetic field in _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on a model recently discussed in @xcite where d7 and anti - d7 branes have been introduced in the ads@xmath18 background .",
    "the brane  anti - brane pair wraps a three cycle in the internal manifold @xmath19 and extends along the rest of the cone . at zero temperature ,",
    "the brane  anti - brane pair joins in the ir realizing a spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry : @xmath20 . the asymptotic angle separation between the brane and the anti - brane  previously denoted by @xmath21 , but",
    "will henceforth be denoted by @xmath22 for reasons that will become apparent in the main text  takes a constant value and corresponds to the coupling of the corresponding operator in the flavor sector . in @xcite",
    "we have discussed in details the phase structure of this model in the presence of a non - zero temperature and an external electro - magnetic field .    before going further ,",
    "let us comment on the relevance of the kuperstein - sonnenschein model .",
    "first , even at zero temperature , the probes break supersymmetry completely and realize a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . furthermore , unlike the sakai - sugimoto model",
    ", the dual field theory is an honest @xmath23-dimensional one .",
    "thus , this model potentially realizes certain properties of qcd better than the sakai - sugimoto model . in this article",
    ", we will consider the back - reaction by the flavor sector in this model at finite temperature .",
    "the rationale behind considering back - reaction in the finite temperature case is three - fold : first note that since the probes break supersymmetry completely , no simplification such as solving first order bps equations will occur at zero temperature .",
    "second , the profile at zero temperature is described by a non - trivial function @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the azimuthal angle of the @xmath26 where the probes are extended ) , which makes analyzing the back - reaction problem more involved .",
    ", the favorable embeddings are described by @xmath27 as shown in @xcite . ]",
    "third , for our current purposes  which is to analyze the phase structure once the back - reaction is taken into account  the relevant background should have a non - zero temperature .",
    "the astute reader might raise the following question : how is this system any different from what has been obtained in _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite which also deals with a finite temperature back - reacted solution ?",
    "this is indeed a very relevant question .",
    "for now we will offer a brief answer to this question through some technicalities involved in the computations and elaborate on these throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "first recall that the precise embedding as considered in _",
    "@xcite and the ones that we consider here _ a la _ @xcite are different in the details .",
    "these details turn out to be important for the physics that we eventually extract from such back - reacted systems .",
    "second , in our system , we have both d7 and anti - d7 branes as opposed to having just branes in the systems considered so far .",
    "the d7-branes are codimension two objects and therefore they act as two dimensional delta function sources .",
    "the resulting equations of motion become coupled pdes which pose a challenge .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented by using the so - called  smearing \" technique which means we introduce many such probes and distribute them in the transverse directions homogeneously .",
    "if we have an equal number of branes and anti - branes smeared at each point , it will not source any @xmath28 potential ( the hodge dual to the axion field ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the framework considered in _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite where there are no anti - branes and therefore a non - trivial @xmath28 potential is sourced .",
    "complying with the conventional wisdom , we find that the flavor back - reaction is understood as irrelevant deformations of the original cft . in our case",
    ", these deformations consist of the departure from conformality and the insertion of a dimension @xmath1 operator .",
    "the former originates from a running dilaton and the later from the deformation of both the @xmath29 base and the @xmath30 fiber direction of the original @xmath31-manifold .",
    "we will not make attempts to precisely identify this dimension @xmath1 operator , however we will extract a lot of information about the  phase structure \" of this theory in a similar spirit as in @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the conformal invariance due to flavor back - reaction has a very important physical consequence . to appreciate this ,",
    "let us recall that in the original klebanov - witten background the flavor sector did not undergo a chiral phase transition at finite temperature simply because there was no other scale available @xcite .",
    "the back - reaction of the flavors introduces this dimension @xmath1 operator , equivalently a dimension @xmath32 coupling denoted by @xmath33 , providing another natural scale in the system .",
    "we can now probe this back - reacted background with an additional set of @xmath34 d7/anti - d7 branes and focus on the physics this extra set of flavor sector experiences .",
    "the interplay of the background temperature and the dimension @xmath32 coupling conspires to conjure up a non - trivial phase structure .",
    "we have studied this phase structure in the @xmath22 vs @xmath35 plane , where @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the background temperature , @xmath38 is the radius of the original ads space and @xmath39 is the t hooft coupling .",
    "another important and interesting question regarding such non - supersymmetric probing is the issue of stability : it is not entirely clear how stability might be affected once the back - reaction by the non - supersymmetric probes are taken into account .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that the non - supersymmetric probes are stable in the kuperstein - sonnenschein model . here",
    "we will not undertake the task of analyzing the fluctuation modes of the back - reacted background .",
    "we will , however , analyze the stability of the additional set of probes that we introduce in this back - reacted background .",
    "we will argue that this additional probe sector does not experience any unbalanced force due to the absence of supersymmetry and the fluctuations of these additional probes are not likely to experience any instability caused by the back - reaction itself .",
    "thus this is also very suggestive of the fact that perhaps stability is not a matter of concern in this model in which supersymmetry plays no role .",
    "we will comment more on this issue in the concluding part of this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we start with a brief review of the kuperstein - sonnenschein model at finite temperature in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the issue of taking back - reaction into account , describe the analytical solution treating the back - reaction perturbatively and offer comments on the dual field theory . in the following section , we discuss various thermodynamic properties of this back - reacted background .",
    "then , in section 5 , we introduce an additional set of probe brane / anti - brane system in this back - reacted background and study the phase structure in the probe sector . in section 6 , we argue that this probe sector does not suffer from any instability after the inclusion of the back - reaction .",
    "finally we conclude in section 7 with future directions .",
    "various technical details have been relegated to four appendices : appendix a contains a discussion of the smearing form , appendix b contains the details of the equations of motion , in appendix c we have provided the detailed steps towards obtaining the leading order back - reacted solution and in appendix d we have obtained the action corresponding to the quadratic fluctuations of the additional probe sector in our back - reacted background .",
    "in @xcite , the authors introduced probe d7/anti - d7 branes in the ads@xmath40 background such that the d7/anti - d7 branes wrap a three cycle in the internal manifold @xmath19 and are extended along the rest of the conifold @xmath41 . the field theory dual to this supergravity background",
    "is given by an @xmath42 superconformal quiver gauge theory with a gauge group @xmath43 and two bi - fundamental chiral superfields which are usually denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these chiral superfields transform in the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 representations of the gauge group .",
    "this theory also possesses a global @xmath48 symmetry which , in the dual gravitational background , manifests itself as the isometry group of the internal manifold @xmath31 .    introducing probe d7/anti - d7 branes amounts to introducing matter fields in the fundamental representation",
    ": specifically it corresponds to adding left - handed / right - handed weyl fermions in the dual gauge theory .",
    "this gives rise to a global symmetry group of @xmath49 flavor symmetry , where @xmath10 is the number of flavors that we have introduced in this background .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the probe d7 and anti - d7 branes have no choice but to dynamically join in the ir and realize spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry : @xmath20 . in the presence of a black hole horizon in the bulk ( and therefore finite temperature in the dual field theory ) , there are two types of profile : one where the brane  anti - brane pair joins at some ir radial position ; and the other where they separately fall into the black hole .",
    "the former corresponds to a chiral symmetry broken phase and the later to the chiral symmetry restored phase .",
    "this phenomenon is pictorially represented in fig .",
    "[ kwprobe ] .",
    "although we have two different types of embeddings , there is no possibility of a phase transition between them .",
    "the reason is simple : since our background is conformal , temperature is the only scale .",
    "thus there is no meaning of having a  high \" or a  low \" temperature phase , there will be an unique phase at any temperature . as argued and explicitly shown in @xcite , introducing a non - zero temperature immediately favors the chiral symmetry restored phase .",
    "let us be more specific .",
    "the background at finite temperature is given by ads@xmath50-schwarzschild@xmath51 .. in keeping with the notations used in the later parts of the paper , we will define @xmath52 . ]",
    "the time direction is euclideanized and compacitified on a circle .",
    "the temperature is then simply given by the inverse period of this circle .",
    "in lorentzian signature this background is given by @xmath53 + \\frac{1}{9 } \\left ( e^3 + \\tilde{e}^3\\right)^2 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 is the time , @xmath55 represents the spatial @xmath56-directions , @xmath57 is the location of the event - horizon and @xmath38 is the radius of curvature of the ads - space .",
    "after euclideanization , the temperature is given by @xmath58 .",
    "also @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the left - invariant one - forms of two independent @xmath61 s . there is an @xmath30 symmetry which rotates @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "finally there is a @xmath64 symmetry which acts as @xmath65 .",
    "thus the background has an @xmath66 symmetry , where the @xmath30 is the r - symmetry .",
    "we choose the vielbeins as follows@xcite @xmath67 here @xmath68 and @xmath69 parametrize the two @xmath26s .",
    "the ranges for the angular directions are given by : @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "with this parametrization , the metric on the @xmath31 becomes @xmath73 where in the second line the metric on @xmath31 has been written as the @xmath30 fibration over a khler - einstein manifold @xmath29 and @xmath74 yields the khler form _ via _ @xmath75 .",
    "the probe branes are aligned such that they span the minkowski- and @xmath76-directions and their profile is represented by @xmath77 .",
    "the dbi action in this case is given by @xmath78 } = - \\cn \\int dt dr r^3 \\left ( 1 + \\frac{r^2}{6 } b(r ) \\left(\\theta_{1,2}'^2 + \\sin^2\\theta_{1,2 } \\ , \\phi_{1,2}'^2 \\right)\\right)^{1/2 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the tension of the probe brane and @xmath80 .",
    "this action leads to equations of motion which admit two different classes of solutions represented by @xmath81 the profiles described by a non - constant @xmath24 are called the u - shaped embeddings and they correspond to the chiral symmetry broken phase ; the other ones are called parallel - shaped and correspond to the chiral symmetry restored phase .",
    "these two classes of profiles are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ kwprobe ] .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that energetics always favors the chiral symmetry restored phase in the presence of a non - zero temperature . in the subsequent sections we will analyze the back - reaction on the supergravity background by these parallel - shaped brane / anti - brane profiles and",
    "obtain the back - reacted background at finite temperature .",
    "from here on we will discuss the effect of back - reaction by the flavor branes at finite temperature .",
    "the probes in our system are co - dimension two objects and thus they give rise to delta function sources in the plane transverse to the seven branes .",
    "thus , the general problem of considering back - reaction by the flavor branes will lead to a set of coupled partial differential equations which is difficult to solve . to simplify this problem",
    "we can make use of the so - called  smearing \" technique as demonstrated in _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "the smearing procedure can be understood as uniformly distributing the large number of probes along the transverse directions such that the global symmetry of the original background is recovered after taking the back - reaction into account .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , we briefly elaborate on this idea . the smearing process for @xmath10 d7-branes can be operationally understood as the following modification to the wess - zumino contribution @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a two - form known as the smearing form , @xmath84 denotes the d7-brane world - volume and @xmath85 denotes the full ten - dimensional manifold .",
    "this two - form determines the distribution of the rr - charges sourced by the d7-branes along the transverse directions .",
    "clearly , if we have an equal number of uniformly smeared d7 and anti - d7 branes the wess - zumino contributions will cancel each other which implies that there is no net rr - charge at each point along the directions where the smearing procedure has been implemented .",
    "( the dual to the axion field ) potential and consequently we will not have any @xmath86 rr - form .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case in _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite where the back - reaction sources a non - trivial axion field . ]",
    "moreover , due to the smearing procedure the dbi - piece of the probe action  in einstein frame  will take the form @xmath87    so in view of the above discussion , to consider the back - reaction we will work with the following action in einstein frame @xmath88   \\nonumber\\\\ & - &   2 \\tau_7 \\sum^{n_f } \\int d^{8}\\xi \\",
    ", e^\\phi \\big [   \\sqrt{-g_{8}^{(1 ) } } \\big ]   -    2 \\tau_7 \\sum^{n_f } \\int d^{8}\\xi \\ , e^\\phi \\big [   \\sqrt{-g_{8}^{(2 ) } } \\big ]   \\ , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript on the induced metric @xmath89 is intended to denote the probes which are located at @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "also , @xmath92 is related to the ten - dimensional newton s constant , @xmath93 is the ricci scalar , @xmath94 is the background metric , @xmath95 is the dilaton and @xmath96 is the self - dual five - form field strength .",
    "the supergravity part of the action scales as @xmath97 and the flavor part of the action scales as @xmath98 .",
    "this is because the supergravity part emerges from the closed string sector whereas the flavor part originates from the open string sector .",
    "note that we have defined the dilaton field such that @xmath95 vanishes asymptotically and the constant @xmath99 , which sets the string coupling _ via _ the relation @xmath100 , has been factored out . to denote the string coupling in the presence of a non - zero back - reaction in keeping with the other notations . ]",
    "the quantity @xmath79 is the tension of the brane : @xmath101 .",
    "the factor of @xmath102 in front of the dbi - action comes from the brane and the anti - brane which contribute equally .",
    "more details on the action and the corresponding equations of motion have been relegated to appendix b.    now that we know which action to extremize to find the desired solution , we should start with an ansatz for the back - reacted background .",
    "the full ten - dimensional metric should be a deformation of the ads@xmath50-schwarzschild@xmath51 background . more precisely",
    " since the d7-branes wrap the entire ads part  the deformation should appear only within the internal @xmath31-part . recall that the smearing procedure has recovered the full @xmath103 global symmetry .",
    "thus the internal manifold is still constraint to possess this isometry and  much like the case considered in @xcite  we make the following ansatz @xmath104 + h^{1/2}(r ) \\bigg\\{\\frac{dr^2}{b(r ) } + \\frac{e^{2g(r)}}{6 } \\sum_{i=1,2 } \\left ( d\\theta_i^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta_i \\ , d\\phi_i^2 \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{e^{2f(r)}}{9 } \\left(d\\psi + \\sum_{i=1,2 } \\cos\\theta_i \\ , d\\phi_i \\right)^2 \\bigg\\ } \\ , \\\\ f_5 & = k(r)h(r)^{3/4}\\left(e^t \\wedge e^{x^1 } \\wedge e^{x^2 } \\wedge e^{x^3 } \\wedge e^r + e^{\\psi } \\wedge e^{\\theta_1 } \\wedge e^{\\phi_1 } \\wedge e^{\\theta_2 } \\wedge e^{\\phi_2}\\right ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are unknown functions and the vielbeins are defined as @xmath109 we also have a non - constant dilaton @xmath110 . the quantization condition for the five form flux @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the tension of the d3-branes , gives @xmath113 with the ansatz in ( [ ansatz ] ) one can now obtain six independent equations for the five unknown functions obtained by extremizing the action in ( [ acback ] ) .",
    "these equations are shown and discussed in details in appendix b. we will not discuss these details here , instead we will move on to the analytical solution that can be obtained for the leading order correction in @xmath0 in the next section .      we will now exhibit the perturbative solution that we obtained treating the back - reaction as a  small \" effect . before discussing this solution explicitly , let us be precise about what we mean by this  smallness \" . from the action we can explicitly check that the back - reaction part of the action ( which is given by the dbi - piece ) is suppressed by a factor of @xmath114 as compared to the supergravity action .",
    "this is expected since the supergravity action scales as @xmath115 and the probe action in ( [ probepure ] ) scales as @xmath116 .",
    "thus to obtain a perturbative solution the relevant expansion parameter , denoted by @xmath117 , will be @xmath118 .    to fix the numerical coefficient , we look at the right hand side of _ e.g. _  equation ( [ eqns ] ) and define @xmath119 where we have used the definition of @xmath39 from equation ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "we will discuss the back - reacted solution at the leading order in @xmath117 .",
    "in fact it turns out that we can find an analytical solution in the leading order in @xmath117 : in appendix c we have discussed the details on how to obtain this solution . here",

    "thus we have actually found a one parameter family of solutions parametrized by this constant . also , @xmath124 is a uv cut - off .",
    "the dilaton runs logarithmically and thus blows up at @xmath125 , which implies that the string coupling also blows up .",
    "thus we need to define this theory with a uv cut - off at @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "let us now discuss some properties of this solution .",
    "note that the solution for the emblackening factor @xmath106 and the warp factor @xmath105 do not receive any qualitative correction due to the back - reaction . at",
    "most we can redefine the ads - radius @xmath38 by absorbing the @xmath117 correction to @xmath128 , which will define an effective t hooft coupling for us .",
    "on the other hand , the functions @xmath129 and @xmath130 do receive interesting corrections .",
    "at first it might seem that the back - reaction changes the asymptotic behavior of these functions , but by the very nature of being a perturbative solution this is not the case .",
    "we will discuss the regime of validity of this solution in the next section where it will become clearer .",
    "it is evident from the perturbative solution given in ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) that the flavor back - reaction deforms the original ads@xmath40-space and this deformation shows up entirely in the internal manifold @xmath31 .",

    "such a deformation corresponds to deforming the lagrangian by @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the corresponding operator and @xmath138 denotes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the field .    from our solution , especially using the expressions in ( [ solf ] ) and ( [ solg ] )",

    "it is clear from the above expansion that @xmath33 corresponds to a coupling which has dimension @xmath32 in the dual field theory .",
    "thus the deformation to the cft in this case will be of the form : @xmath141 , where @xmath142 = 6 $ ] .",
    "the non - normalizable term in the above expansion of the metric function means we have inserted an irrelevant operator of dimension @xmath1 in the dual field theory .",
    "this fact conforms to the conventional wisdom that flavor back - reaction generally gives rise to irrelevant deformations of the background@xcite .",
    "let us be more precise about the identification of the various fields in the gravity background with the operators in the dual field theory .",

    "the advantage of expressing the fluctuation equation in the form given in ( [ sch1 ] ) is that it takes the form of a schrdinger equation with a given potential denoted by @xmath319 . by looking at the behavior of this effective potential",

    "now we can look at how the effective potential behaves as we introduce the parameter @xmath117 and the constant @xmath220 .. ] this is shown in fig .",

    "[ fluc1 ] it is clear that for @xmath320 the effective potential tends to develop a runaway behavior for large @xmath204 . for @xmath321 , however , the effective potential does not develop any possibly pathological behavior as compared to the case of vanishing back - reaction .",
    "actually it can be shown analytically that for large value of @xmath204 , the effective potential behaves as @xmath322 where @xmath124 is the uv cut - off .",

    "this can be regarded to be the first step towards a more involved computation that will address the back - reaction non - perturbatively .",
    "such an endeavor most likely calls for a numerical exploration where one needs to find series solutions for various unknown functions near the event - horizon and the asymptotic boundary and eventually construct a numerical solution that successfully interpolates between these two limits . such series solutions , especially near the asymptotic boundary , are rather non - trivial and take a general form discussed in @xcite .",
    "it will be an interesting exercise to explore the numerical solution to learn more about the physics when @xmath0 is of arbitrary strength .",
    "this will shed light on the effect of the back - reaction for arbitrary values of @xmath0 on the phase diagram and the question of stability beyond the probe limit .",
    "let us offer some comments regarding the stability issue . before taking the back - reaction",
    "the nave picture for the construction is rather simple : we have localized probe branes and anti - branes located at two points in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "they are equivalent to having @xmath10 and @xmath338 charges at two points on a circle .",
    "a simple electrostatic intuition tells us these charges should attract each other and any little perturbation is likely to drive them towards each other and destabilize the system .",
    "however , our analysis does not confirm this intuition .",
    "note that , contrary to what has been observed in @xcite , we do not see any non - trivial cancellation between the dbi and the chern - simons terms in the quadratic fluctuation for the additional probe sector .",
    "thus the stability that we observe is likely rooted in the fact that we have treated the back - reaction perturbatively .",
    "the mass spectrum of the system at finite temperature must be set by the scale of the background temperature .",
    "a deformation , brought about by a small perturbation , is unlikely to drive this mass spectrum to become tachyonic .",
    "this insinuates a limitation of our approach .    on the other hand",
    ", the lack of a non - trivial cancellation as observed in @xcite can be attributed to the use of the smearing technique which does not generate any non - trivial axion field to which the additional probes can couple to .",
    "going beyond the smearing technique , one feasible scenario is that such a cancellation eventually guarantees stability for the system .",
    "thus it is tempting to conjecture that in this system , in which supersymmetry has absolutely no role to play , various forces do perfectly balance each other to guarantee the desired stability . it will be interesting to understand whether such statements can be made more rigorous .",
    "as much as the above - mentioned directions of future work are promising to be very fruitful , there is more interesting physics to explore within the current setup .",
    "the additional probe sector introduced in the back - reacted background can teach us interesting lessons about this model . in @xcite , we have explored the phase structure of the kuperstein - sonnenschein model at finite temperature and in the presence of an external electro - magnetic field .",
    "we can analyze similar physical questions , now including the effect of the back - reaction perturbatively .",
    "this will elucidate how the phase diagrams depend on the various parameters beyond probe limit computations .",
    "another direction to pursue would be to include the effect of a chemical potential in this model . in the presence of such external parameters",
    ", we expect to recover a similar physical picture as reported in _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "since the devoted reader has already experienced a fair share of agony and ecstasy , we will report on these in our forthcoming works @xcite .    moreover",
    ", one could consider studying the back - reaction including the various gauge field excitations on the probes .",
    "such gauge field excitations again correspond to a chemical potential or a constant electromagnetic field .",
    "work along these directions has been performed in other models in _ e.g. _",
    "it will be interesting to investigate and identify the robust universal features within our model as well .",
    "note that the physics of chiral symmetry breaking can  perhaps more interestingly  also be realized by placing probe brane  anti - branes in the klebanov - strassler background @xcite .",
    "however , the finite temperature version of the background is known only numerically in @xcite or approximately for large temperatures@xcite .",
    "the problem of considering back - reaction in this case will be technically more involved , but perhaps more rewarding from a physics point of view .",
    "interestingly , in that model , the antipodal probe solution , simply described by @xmath295 , exists even at zero temperature .",
    "thus analyzing the back - reaction for such profiles may be a tractable and interesting problem to consider .",
    "our work crucially depends on the smearing technique and it really captures the physics in an approximation  akin to the  s - wave \" approximation  of the actual situation .",
    "indeed we really have localized sources and not smeared sources .",
    "although we realize interesting physics within this approximation , it is not evident how robust these features actually are beyond this framework , which is a technically more challenging problem because one has to consider localized sources and thus one will have to work with coupled pdes instead of the coupled ordinary differential equations ( ode ) that we have encountered herein . nonetheless , it will be an interesting problem to consider in the future .",
    "let us conclude by saying that although the problem of understanding the strongly coupled physics of the quark - gluon plasma remains a daunting task , we are slowly making progress in uncovering some key universal features of the strong coupling regime using these model computations .",
    "we are grateful to elena caceres and carlos nunez for numerous illuminating discussions and encouragements about this work .",
    "we specially thank javier tarrio for raising a crucial point regarding the identification of the dimension @xmath143 operator .",
    "mi and ak are grateful to the kavli institute for the physics and mathematics of the universe at the university of tokyo and mit for hospitality during the final stages of this project .",

    "the idea of the smearing is to recover the full symmetry of the background we had before placing any probes .",
    "the @xmath339-symmetry can be recovered simply by picking another pair of d7/anti - d7 branes with transverse plane described by the @xmath340 directions for each pair of d7/anti - d7 brane with transverse plane described by @xmath68 .",
    "the induced line element on the radial direction of the probe brane is simply @xmath341 dr^2 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is invariant ( up to reparametrizations ) under the shifts : @xmath342 and @xmath343 where @xmath344 and @xmath345 are arbitrary constant numbers .",
    "thus we can initially pick @xmath90 and @xmath346 to focus on the  great circle \" .",
    "we can smear the branes on this great circle by using the shift symmetry in @xmath347 ; then we can rotate this great circle using the shift symmetry in @xmath178 .",
    "this process should then cover the entire @xmath26 and thus recover the full symmetry of the background .",
    "the density of the branes is then given by @xmath348 where @xmath349 and @xmath350 are the asymptotic values of @xmath178 and @xmath347 respectively .",
    "now to determine the smearing form we follow @xcite .",
    "the most general 2-form invariant under @xmath351 is given by @xmath352 where @xmath353 , @xmath354 are four hitherto undetermined functions . here",
    "@xmath355 is another 2-form invariant under the same aforementioned symmetry and is independent from the other terms .",
    "now @xmath355 can be fixed in the following by demanding that @xmath83 is closed , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath356 . after some algebra it is straightforward to show that @xmath83 takes the following form @xmath357 which matches exactly the result of @xcite , including the overall normalization constant .",
    "now , in the notations of @xcite , the embedding functions of the probe branes are given by @xmath358 where @xmath349 is the asymptotic value of @xmath178 ( which is fixed to be @xmath359 for a single set of branes ) .",
    "now @xmath83 can also be evaluated using the formula @xcite @xmath360 from the above formula it is clear that @xmath361 ( since there is no @xmath362 -component for example ) .",
    "thus @xmath363 is simply constant . at non - zero temperature",
    "the energetically favored embeddings are the ones which go all the way into the horizon @xcite and therefore @xmath364 for all values of @xmath204 . on the other hand , at zero temperature we know that the probe banes meet at some radial position given by @xmath226 ( we fix this parameter in our problem ) .",
