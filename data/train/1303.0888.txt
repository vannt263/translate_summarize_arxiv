    "we define lambda words after some basic notation and definitions .",

    "the differences @xmath45 are generally decreasing as @xmath39 increases , but not strictly . moreover , because @xmath43 contains repetitions , we may assign each element of @xmath43 to an integer ( an element in @xmath14 ) through a bijective mapping @xmath46 : let @xmath47 . if @xmath48 is the least value such that @xmath49 , then @xmath50 .",

    "according to kimberling and brown @xcite , an array such as the one shown in figure [ rank ] is _ transposable _ , because substituting @xmath71 for @xmath4 yields the transpose of the array .",
    "adding one to each element in column one produces http://oeis.org/a022330 [ ] , and the same addition on elements of the first row gives http://oeis.org/a022331 [ ] .",
    "the relationship between transposable interspersions and lambda words is this : connecting the elements of the figure [ rank ] array in ascending order determines a sequence of vectors that begins @xmath80 , and these are also the coefficients for the successive elements of the difference sequence @xmath64 .",
