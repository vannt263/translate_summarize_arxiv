    "while the pole ( branch cut ) of the first term in the right - hand side provides the continuum , @xmath23 in the second term may introduce a pole even below the continuum , which implies the existence of a stable bound state .",

    "<S> we have found that the nematic phase is stable near the saturation field and exhibits a steep magnetization curve reminiscent of that in 1d . </S>",
    "<S> this steep behavior slightly below the _ actual _ saturation field is consistent with the recent nmr measurement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also discussed the possible second - order - phase transition from the usual nematic phase to a new spin - density - modulated phase with the transverse nematic order .    </S>",
