    "with improvements in the colloidal fabrication of structures on the micro- and nanometer scale , new areas of study have been made possible . in particular , researchers are now able to produce atom - like electronic devices with their own unique spectra and shell structures @xcite . the distinct characteristics of such devices may be controlled through fabrication , in turn producing structures with unique electronic properties .",
    "periodic arrays of atoms have been studied extensively for nearly a century .",
    "however , we may now examine periodic arrays of nano - structures in which the tunneling , polarizability , and coulomb interaction may all be varied , thus giving us the power to control an electronic wavefunction to a degree without an atomic analogue .",
    "small multi - dot systems show coherent phenomena in experiments@xcite while disordered arrays of colloidal quantum dots display variable long - range hopping.@xcite it should soon be possible to examine collective electronic excitations of periodic nanostructures . with this in mind , we choose a nano - structure which will confine the electron on the nanoscale in such a way as to bring about novel characteristics .",
    "in this paper we consider electrons confined to spherical shells , sometimes called `` quantum dot quantum wells '' ( qdqw ) or `` core - shell quantum dots . ''",
    "qdqws are heterostructures where layers of different semi - conducting materials alternate in a single nano - crystal .",
    "one well characterized example is the cds / cdse / cds system , i.e. a cds core and outer shell with a cdse inner shell @xcite . in this case",
    "each layer is on the order of 1 - 2 nm and is separated by a large electronic band gap , thus allowing the investigation of quantum confinement in a geometry in which electrons occupy the surface of a sphere .",
    "cds / cdse / cds qdqw s have also been found to have an electron - g factor which varies as a function of quantum well width as well as a transverse spin lifetime of several nano - seconds at temperatures approaching room temperature @xcite .",
    "we choose qdqw s for two reasons .",
    "first , because they have already be fabricated and are well - characterized,@xcite and second , because their excluded core structure yields properties not found in regular quantum dot systems .",
    "previous research@xcite has found that in a 1d array of singly - charged nano - rings , a quantum phase transition ( @xmath0 ) occurs which allows the system to spontaneously break symmetry into anti - ferroeletric ( afe ) alignment .",
    "studies of the 2d ring problem revealed another phase transition from random orientation to a striped afe state , analogous to unitary transition of the 2d xy model .",
    "the focus of this paper is to show an analogous transition occurs in an ordered array of qdqw s .    in the section below",
    "we describe our model , and then our methods for analyzing it in the classical and quantum mechanical limits",
    ". we then present results for the 2d square lattice , the 2d triangular lattice and the 3d face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "both the 2d square lattice and 3d face - centered cubic lattice systems yield a phase transition from random ( classical ) or uniform ( quantum mechanical ) distribution to an anti - ferroelectric state .",
    "in our model , each qdqw is treated as a infinitesimally thick spherical shell of radius @xmath1 with an electric charge on the surface .",
    "charging might be achieved either by doping,@xcite tunneling from a backgate or be adjusting an electrochemical potential.@xcite the radial degree of freedom can be neglected when the gap between radial excitations is large compared to that of orbital eigenstates .",
    "we then consider periodic arrays of singly - charged qdqw s in either two or three dimensions and define a distance , @xmath2 , between neighbors . in 2d",
    "we choose @xmath2 as the lattice constant so that @xmath3 . in a 3d face - centered cubic lattice",
    "@xmath2 is half the distance between vertices of the fcc cells so that the separation between nearest neighbors is given by @xmath4 .",
    "we then consider the electrostatic interaction solely between nearest neighbors .",
    "though the coulomb repulsion acts over large distances , we assume that there is sufficient screening so that only nearest neighbor interactions are significant .",
    "furthermore , the insulating shell around each qdqw allows us to ignore electron tunneling between dots .      before solving a quantum mechanical problem",
    "it is often helpful to look at the classical case , which is usually easier to solve and provides an guide to the quantum ground state .",
    "classically the electron is a point charge constrained to the surface of a sphere . because of this constraint",
    ", it has a dipole moment ( with respect to the shell center ) of constant magnitude but random direction .",
    "adjacent moments interact leading to the polarization instability , as we will show below .",

    "the electrostatic energy of the array is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the location of the @xmath8-th electron , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are restricted to nearest neighbors , and the factor of @xmath10 corrects for double counting .",

    "the unit vector @xmath15 points from the center of the @xmath8-th to the center of the @xmath9-th sphere .",
    "we have also assumed that the lattice possesses reflection symmetry . from eq.([eq : spinu ] ) we see that the system has an afe heisenberg interaction and a symmetry breaking term .",
    "the symmetry breaking term encourages alignment of adjacent spins in the direction of the lattice vector connecting them .",
    "further analysis requires knowledge of the lattice vectors of the specific system .",
    "[ fig : models ]      instead of a single point charge on a sphere , in the quantum mechanical problem the electron is treated as a charge distribution constrained to the surface of a spherical shell .",
