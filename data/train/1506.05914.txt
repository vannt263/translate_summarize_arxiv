    "the classification of the smooth projective varieties satisfying at least one laplace equation is a classical problem , still very far from being solved .",
    "we recall that a projective variety @xmath8 is said to satisfy a laplace equation of order @xmath0 , for an integer @xmath9 , if its @xmath0-osculating space at a general point has dimension strictly less than expected .",
    "the most famous example is the togliatti surface , a rational surface in @xmath10 parametrized by cubics , obtained from the @xmath11rd veronese embedding @xmath12 of @xmath13 by a suitable projection from four points : the del pezzo surface obtained projecting @xmath12 from three general points on it admits a point which belongs to all its osculating spaces , so projecting further from this special point one obtains a surface having all osculating spaces of dimension @xmath14 instead of the expected @xmath15 .",
    "this surface is named from eugenio togliatti who gave a classification of rational surfaces parametrized by cubics and satisfying at least one laplace equation of order @xmath16 . for more details",
    "see the original articles of togliatti @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for discussions of this example . in @xcite",
    "the two authors of this note and ottaviani described a connection , due to apolarity , between projective varieties satisfying at least one laplace equation and homogeneous artinian ideals in a polynomial ring , generated by polynomials of the same degree and failing the weak lefschetz property ( wlp for short ) .",
    "let us recall that a homogeneous ideal @xmath17 $ ] fails the weak lefschetz property in some degree @xmath18 if , for any linear form @xmath19 , the map of multiplication by @xmath19 from @xmath20 to @xmath21 is not of maximal rank ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to this connection , explained in detail in section 2 , they obtained in the toric case the classification of the smooth rational threefolds parametrized by cubics and satisfying a laplace equation of order 2 , and gave a conjecture to extend it to varieties of any dimension .",
    "this conjecture has been recently proved in @xcite .",
    "note that the assumption that the variety is toric translates in the fact that the related ideals are generated by monomials , which simplifies apolarity and allows to exploit combinatorial methods .",
    "this point of view had been introduced by perkinson in @xcite , and applied to the classification of toric surfaces and threefolds satisfying laplace equations under some rather strong additional assumptions on the osculating spaces .    in this note",
    "we begin the study of the analogous problems for smooth toric rational varieties parametrized by monomials of degree @xmath22 , or equivalently for artinian ideals of @xmath23 generated by monomials of degree @xmath0 .",
    "the picture becomes soon much more involved than in the case of cubics , and for the moment a complete classification appears out of reach .",
    "we consider mainly minimal smooth toric togliatti systems of forms of degree @xmath0 in @xmath23 , i.e. homogeneous artinian ideals generated by monomials failing the wlp , minimal with respect to this property , and such that the apolar linear system parametrizes a smooth variety .",
    "the first goal of this note is to establish minimal and maximal bounds , depending on @xmath24 and @xmath2 , for the number of generators of togliatti systems of this form , and to classify the systems reaching the minimal bound , or close to reach it .",
    "we then investigate if all values comprised between the minimal and the maximal bound can be obtained as number of generators of a minimal smooth togliatti system .",
    "we prove that the answer is positive if @xmath4 , but negative if @xmath6 .",
    "if we avoid smoothness assumption , the answer becomes positive for @xmath25 but is still negative for @xmath26 , even we detect some intervals and sporadic values that are reached .",
    "finally , as applications of our results , we study the mumford ",
    "takemoto stability of the syzygy bundle associated to a minimal smooth togliatti system with @xmath4 .",
    "next we outline the structure of this note . in section  [ defs and prelim results ]",
    "we fix the notation and we collect the basic results on laplace equations and the weak lefschetz property needed in the sequel .",
    "section  [ minimalnumbergenerators ] contains the main results of this note .",
    "precisely , after recalling the results for degree @xmath16 and @xmath11 , in theorem [ mainthm1 ] we prove that the minimal bound @xmath27 on the number of generators of a minimal smooth togliatti system of forms of degree @xmath0 in @xmath1 variables , for @xmath28 , is equal to @xmath29 , and classify the systems reaching the bound .",
    "then in theorem [ mainthm2 ] we get the complete classification for systems with number of generators @xmath30 .",
    "we also compute the maximal bound @xmath31 and give various examples . in section  [ number ]",
    "we prove that for @xmath4 and any @xmath28 all numbers in the range between @xmath27 and @xmath31 are reached ( proposition [ interval ] ) , while for @xmath6 the value @xmath32 is a gap ( proposition [ 2n+3 ] ) .",
    "we then prove that , avoiding smoothness , for @xmath25 the whole interval is covered .",

    "part of the great interest in the wlp stems from the ubiquity of its presence ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - @xcite ) and the fact that its presence puts severe constraints on the possible hilbert functions , which can appear in various disguises ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
