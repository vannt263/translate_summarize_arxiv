    "in a seminal paper in 1987 , harten and osher introduced the essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) reconstruction technique @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of eno is to construct several different candidate polynomial interpolations and to choose the smoothest approximation to work with .",
    "the choice is facilitated by means of smoothness indicators , which become larger as the interpolation varies more rapidly .",
    "building on the eno scheme , liu , osher and chan introduced the weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) reconstruction technique in 1994 @xcite .",
    "the weno technique comes from the realization that the three approximations of eno can be combined to construct a higher - order approximation . instead of the logical statements inherent in the eno scheme , the weno scheme weighs every lower - order approximation according to its smoothness indicator .",
    "thus , in smooth regions , weno gives a better approximation , while reducing to eno near discontinuities .",
    "weno schemes are ubiquitous in science and engineering , with applications in fluid dynamics , astrophysics , or any other application involving convection - dominated dynamics @xcite .",
    "the technique is mainly applied in the context of hyperbolic and convection - dominated parabolic pdes . however , since it is a highly advanced interpolation technique , it also has applications in fields that do not use it as part of a pde solver , such as computer vision and image processing @xcite .",
    "the standard weno scheme as it is most commonly used today was devised by jiang and shu @xcite , and is sometimes referred to as the weno - js scheme .",
    "recently , several variants of the weno scheme have appeared that improve the order of accuracy near points where the first derivative vanishes .",
    "several examples include the weno - m @xcite , weno - z @xcite and weno - ns @xcite schemes . for a comparison of the performance of these schemes ,",
    "see zhao et al .",
    "other efforts have focussed on creating energy - stable weno schemes such as those constructed by yamaleev et al .",
    "@xcite , or decreasing numerical dissipation by considering central discretisations such as considered by fu et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most common implementations of weno schemes use a five - point stencil , which can be subdivided into three three - point stencils .",
    "weno schemes switch seamlessly between the third and fifth - order reconstructions that are possible on the five - point stencil .",
    "the idea is straightforward : when all three smoothness indicators are roughly equal , a weno scheme switches to the fifth - order mode .",
    "when one or more smoothness indicators are large , a weno scheme switches to the third - order mode .    in this formulation , it seems obvious that information is discarded when only one out of three smoothness indicators is large .",
    "when this happens , the two smooth approximations could still be used to obtain better accuracy .",
    "the current weno methods do not allow for control over the numerical solution in this situation .",
    "however , one very recent scheme which does feature this type of functionality is the targeted eno scheme of hu et al .",
    "their approach is completely novel and uses a combination of ideas from eno and weno schemes . in this work ,",
    "we propose a design strategy that aims to adapt existing weno schemes such that they utilise the maximum number of grid points that form a smooth substencil .",
    "moreover , we shall explicitly construct variants of two existing weno schemes that exhibit this property .",
    "apart from the order of convergence , one can also analyse a weno scheme in terms of its spectral properties @xcite .",
    "weno schemes switch non - linearly between linear modes of operation and as such , it is possible to investigate the spectral properties by analysing the underlying linear schemes @xcite .",
    "we will also show that our method allows for tuning of spectral properties such as dispersion and dissipation .",
    "this paper is arranged in the following way : in section [ sec : weno_recap ] we give a short recap of weno methods , in section [ sec : embedded_weno ] we introduce the embedding method , in section [ sec : spectral ] we look at the spectral properties of the embedded schemes and in section [ sec : numerical_experiments ] we show results of several numerical experiments",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions and outlook in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the weno method is an advanced interpolation technique that aims to suppress spurious oscillations .",
    "it is commonly used in as part of a high - resolution scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws , e.g. , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the flux function . to obtain numerical solutions ,",
    "we introduce a grid , @xmath2 , with grid size @xmath3 . with each point @xmath4 ,",
    "we associate a cell centred on @xmath4 of width @xmath3 , i.e. , the interval @xmath5 . taking the average of the conservation law over cell @xmath6 ,",
    "we find @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average value of @xmath9 over cell @xmath6 .",
    "note that this ode for the average value @xmath8 is exact as long as we know the exact value of @xmath9 on the cell boundaries .",
    "we shall , in the following , suppress the explicit time dependence of @xmath9 , as we interpolate @xmath9 in space for fixed time . in a numerical scheme",
    ", we introduce a numerical flux function to represent the fluxes on the cell edges .",
    "regardless of the choice of numerical flux , we require the value of @xmath9 at the cell interfaces @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11",
    ". however , if @xmath9 is discontinuous and we would naively use polynomial interpolation , we inadvertently introduce spurious oscillations .",
    "a ( w)eno scheme is a more advanced interpolation technique that is designed to suppress these oscillations .    the classical weno scheme , or weno - js , can be constructed by considering a five - point stencil around @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "the large stencil can be divided into three smaller substencils , viz . ,",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; see figure  [ fig : weno_stencils ] .    on each of these substencils , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , we can construct a second - degree polynomial @xmath18 that has the same cell averaged values as @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath19 evaluating these polynomials on the cell edge @xmath20 , we obtain three approximations for @xmath21 , given by    [ eq : third_order_approximations ] @xmath22    note that approximation @xmath23 takes only information from @xmath16 for @xmath24 .",
    "these approximations are third - order accurate , and their errors are given by    [ eq : third_order_approximations_error ] @xmath25    it is straightforward to show that one can obtain a fifth - order approximation by taking a linear combination of the third - order approximations of .",
    "the coefficients are the unique numbers that sum to unity and eliminate the third and fourth - order error terms of the taylor expansions in .",
    "some linear algebra quickly reveals that we should use @xmath26 in terms of the cell averages , this fifth - order approximation is given by @xmath27 using , we find that the error term for this expression is indeed fifth - order , i.e. , @xmath28 the coefficients in are referred to as the linear or optimal weights .",
    "we denote the linear weights by @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "so far , we have shown that a fifth - order linear approximation can be constructed from three third - order underlying approximations . however , whenever there is a discontinuity on the stencil , the fifth - order approximation incurs spurious oscillations and a third - order approximation might actually be better in some sense .",
    "thus , we would like to find a set of nonlinear weights that takes into account the smoothness of each third - order approximation .",
    "whenever @xmath9 is smooth on the full stencil @xmath32 , we want these nonlinear weights to approximate the linear weights . on the other hand ,",
    "when a substencil contains a discontinuity , we would like to have the weight associated with that stencil to be small .",
    "this idea can be realized by introducing smoothness indicators @xmath33 , @xmath17 . there are several smoothness indicators available in the literature @xcite , each one exhibiting some desirable property .",
    "a very popular set of indicators , however , was introduced by jiang and shu and is given by @xmath34 a tedious but straightforward calculus exercise shows that    [ eq : smoothness_definition ] @xmath35    where one can recognise undivided finite differences . provided that @xmath9 is sufficiently smooth , a taylor expansion reveals that @xmath36 , where the coefficients of the expansion contain various derivatives of @xmath9 , either squared or multiplied with higher order derivatives , i.e. ,    [ eq : smoothness_taylor ] @xmath37    where @xmath38 is shorthand for @xmath39 , etc . whereas an eno scheme uses a logical statement to select the interpolation with the lowest smoothness indicator , a weno scheme proposes to use a convex combination of the third - order interpolations , much like . to this end , the nonlinear weights @xmath40 are introduced , which are functions of the smoothness indicators .",
    "thus , a weno scheme uses a linear combination of the form @xmath41 consistency requires that the nonlinear weights @xmath40 ( @xmath17 ) sum to unity .",
    "hence , to construct nonlinear weights that satisfy the requirements discussed earlier , we first compute the unnormalized nonlinear weights as @xmath42 with @xmath43 a small number to avoid division by zero and @xmath44 .",
    "typical values are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the unnormalized weights are subsequently normalised to obtain the nonlinear weights @xmath47 the weno - js scheme gives fifth - order accuracy whenever @xmath9 is smooth , i.e. , @xmath48 and consequently @xmath36 , or if @xmath49 is sufficiently large compared to the second - order terms in the expansions , otherwise only third - order is attained @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it gives third - order accuracy whenever a substencil contains a discontinuity , since then the corresponding smoothness indicator becomes large . by choosing instead to use only one of the smooth substencils ,",
    "oscillations are suppressed .",
    "weno schemes are commonly employed in a method of lines ( mol ) approach , were one leaves time continuous while discretising space .",
    "this approach then turns a pde into a large number of coupled odes , resulting in a system of equations @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the result of the application of the weno scheme .",
    "after the spatial discretisation , one discretises time by setting time levels @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the time integrators of choice are the strong stability preserving runge - kutta methods ( ssprk ) @xcite .",
    "these are explicit runge - kutta methods that have a high order of accuracy and do not incur spurious oscillations due to time integration . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall use the fairly standard ssprk(3,3 ) method , one time step of this method is given by    [ eq : tvd - rk ] @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the intermediate stages .",
    "this method exhibits the strong stability preserving property and provides a third - order accuracy in time .",
    "moreover , wang and rong @xcite have shown that this method is linearly stable when combined with a five - point weno scheme .",
    "we now pose the question of what happens when the solution on two adjacent substencils are smooth and the third one contains a discontinuity .",
    "thus , either the solution is smooth on @xmath57 and @xmath58 and not smooth on @xmath59 or , the solution is smooth on @xmath58 and @xmath59 and not on @xmath57 .",
    "the answer to the question , of course , is that the weno - js scheme still provides third - order accuracy while suppressing oscillations .",
    "however , the scheme generates a linear combination of the two smooth substencils that is uncontrollable by the user .    as a shorthand whenever the solution is smooth on a substencil @xmath16 , we call the substencil smooth .",
    "let us examine the normalised weights , from the definition - we find that @xmath60 where we have labelled the weights with a superscript @xmath61 to indicate the weno - js weights .",
    "let us assume @xmath62 and for simplicity ignore the small constant @xmath49 in the analysis .",
    "suppose that the discontinuity is only in substencil @xmath57 , this leads to @xmath63 from , so that @xmath64 where the constant @xmath65 is independent of @xmath66 .",
    "using this in and rearranging terms , we find @xmath67 when we investigate the other substencils , we find the ratios    @xmath68    using these in , we find    @xmath69    and by the same token @xmath70    note that the result simply is a redistribution of the weights , keeping the same proportions .",
    "ignoring small terms of order @xmath71 , we find    [ eq : proportions ] @xmath72 one can perform a similar computation whenever @xmath73 and one finds @xmath74    moreover , any conventional weno scheme exhibits this behaviour because the unnormalised nonlinear weights @xmath75 are determined using local information . let us define a local weno scheme as one where @xmath75 only depends on either :    * @xmath33 only , * or @xmath33 with and one single global smoothness indicator .",
    "the first case is obvious , as any unnormalised weight is determined using only the local substencil .",
    "the second case is slightly more subtle , as each unnormalised weight uses information from the global smoothness indicator .",
    "however , all nonlinear weights use exactly the same global information .",
    "for example , both weno - js and weno - z are local weno schemes .",
    "[ lem : local_weno ] for @xmath76 , any local weno scheme satisfies @xmath77    \\1 .",
    "suppose @xmath78 is not smooth , then its contribution must be eliminated from the resulting convex combination , e.g. , and hence its nonlinear weight must go to @xmath79 . if , at the same time @xmath16 is smooth , its contribution must be kept and its nonlinear weight must go to some nonzero value .",
    "thus , we arrive at @xmath80 .",
    "if we switch around the roles for @xmath78 and @xmath16 , we find @xmath81 .",
    "note that the normalised nonlinear weights are always some constant multiple of the unnormalised nonlinear weights , where the constant is independent of the substencils .",
    "thus , a ratio of unnormalised weights always equals a ratio of normalised weights .",
    "assume now that all substencils are smooth , then @xmath82 .",
    "however , since this must also equal @xmath83 . in the first case of a local weno scheme",
    "the unnormalised weights are only a function of the local smoothness indicator , hence @xmath82 must be true regardless of whether other substencils are smooth or not .",
    "when a global smoothness indicator is involved , we reach the same conclusion since it has the same value on any stencil , regardless of whether there is a discontinuity present or not.@xmath84    we propose a technique that allows control over the nonlinear weights in the situation when either @xmath63 or @xmath73 . consequently , this allows for direct control over the truncation error of the numerical solution .",
    "we call this new type of scheme an embedded weno scheme . similarly to conventional weno schemes , we demand fifth - order accuracy whenever the numerical solution is smooth on the entire stencil @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , it should reduce to an eno scheme when two out of three substencils contain a discontinuity .",
    "let us set the question of how to achieve this aside for the moment and first introduce some terminology .",
    "we call the overall third - to - fifth - order accurate scheme the outer scheme . the resulting scheme when there are only two adjacent smooth substencils , we call the inner scheme , see figure  [ fig : outer_inner_sketch ] . for instance , we may use a fourth - order inner scheme in combination with weno - js as the outer scheme .    examining figure  [ fig : outer_inner_sketch ] more closely",
    ", we see that if @xmath59 contains the discontinuity and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are smooth , then the discontinuity must lie in the interval @xmath85 .",
    "consequently , there are four grid points on which we have a smooth function to interpolate . from the two remaining substencils ,",
    "we can construct a four - point stencil where we can define our inner scheme . when @xmath57 contains the discontinuity",
    ", we have the four - point stencil @xmath86 to use for the inner scheme . when @xmath59 contains the discontinuity we have @xmath87 .    even though we are able to obtain a higher formal order of convergence , banks et al",
    "@xcite have pointed out that one often obtains sublinear convergence near linearly degenerate discontinuities , such as the contact waves of the euler equations .",
    "they estimate that the convergence rate becomes @xmath88 for a scheme with formal convergence rate @xmath89 . in our case",
    ", this suggests the convergence rate is increased from @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "thus , the benefits might be less great as a naive estimate would suggest .",
    "however , aside from the increased convergence rate , we will also show how embedded schemes can be used to improve spectral properties .    with the terminology in place we can turn to the basic question : how to embed one weno scheme in another .",
    "thus , we would like the nonlinear weights to converge to the inner scheme whenever appropriate .",
    "otherwise , they should remain approximately equal to the nonlinear weights of the outer scheme .",
    "this suggests that we multiply the unnormalised weights @xmath75 of the outer scheme by a correction that is ordinarily close to unity , but activates when either @xmath92 or @xmath93 becomes @xmath94 .",
    "the correction is constructed such that it adjusts the proportions found in .",
    "suppose the inner scheme is given by the linear weights @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we write the stencils containing a discontinuity in parenthesis in the superscript and the substencil index in the subscript .",
    "the desired convex combination then becomes    [ eq : inner_scheme ] @xmath99    we consider two possible choices for the linear weights of the inner scheme , see table [ tab : inner_scheme_weights ] .",
    "the first is the fourth - order linear combination which is possible on the four - point stencil .",
    "the second choice consists of placing the superfluous weight onto the middle substencil , i.e. , using the approximation @xmath100 for @xmath101 or @xmath102 .",
    "the fourth - order choice is motivated from an order - of - convergence perspective , while the third - order choice comes from a spectral point of view , see section [ sec : spectral ] .",

    "thus , any correction we introduce must be incorporated into the unnormalised nonlinear weights and still work after normalisation .",
    "furthermore , what is happening in substencil @xmath59 must influence both substencils @xmath57 and @xmath58 and _ mutatis mutandis _",
    "substencil @xmath57 must influence both @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it follows that the corrections must be functions of multiple smoothness indicators and thus enforce that the resulting weno scheme is nonlocal . as a final note",
    ", we have seen from that in the appropriate limit , the nonlinear weights are simply a redistribution of the linear weights .",
    "we therefore have to influence the proportions of the linear weights , so that when appropriate the linear weights should be multiplied with some relative proportions @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the relative proportions can be found as    [ eq : fourth_order_proportions ] @xmath112    the naming convention is again to label the relative proportions with the index of the substencil that is not smooth .",

    "( implementation ) _ the unnormalised nonlinear weights must be multiplied with a correction .",

    "( embedding ) _ when there is a discontinuity present , the scheme must produce the inner weights on the smooth substencils .      here , we construct a general framework for embedded weno schemes .",
    "the implementation and consistency conditions suggest that our correction is ordinarily close to a constant , while according to the nonlocality condition it may not be a function of a single smoothness indicator .",
    "since the smoothness indicators are typically functions of the undivided differences , this suggests we use ratios of the smoothness indicators .",

    ", a small constant @xmath117 is added in the denominator to avoid division by zero . denoting the outer scheme with superscript @xmath118 and the embedded scheme with @xmath119 , we suggest using @xmath120 which is probably the simplest possible nonlocal correction : a linear combination of ratios . here , @xmath121 ( @xmath66 and @xmath122 in the range @xmath123 ) are a collection of undetermined coefficients .",
    "the constant @xmath117 is chosen very small , @xmath124 , so that we may ignore it in the analysis according to borges et al @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to as the general form of an embedded weno scheme and the term in parenthesis as the general form of a correction",
    ".    the consistency condition will give us a set of equations that has to be satisfied by the coefficients @xmath121 .",
    "it tells us that when the solution is smooth all corrections must be close to a fixed constant , say @xmath65 .",
    "note that we may choose any constant @xmath65 on the right hand side , as the normalisation step will cancel it out , we shall fix it arbitrarily to 1 .",
    "let us assume that the outer scheme satisfies , whenever the solution is smooth , @xmath125 .",
    "for instance , weno - js has @xmath126 and weno - z has @xmath127 .",

    "if @xmath131 , the coefficients @xmath121 must also provide linear combinations of smoothness indicators that cancel out the lower order terms in the taylor expansions .",

    "this allows us to introduce @xmath184 where we shall ignore the small number @xmath117 .",
    "note that we can also choose @xmath185 and introduce two variables , but this makes the analysis needlessly complicated , as we shall see , all the interesting cases are captured in @xmath186 .",
    "we can write the unnormalised nonlinear weights as follows ,    @xmath187    we can thus write the nonlinear weight @xmath188 , for instance , as @xmath189 where the common factor @xmath190 cancels out .",
    "the other nonlinear weights can also be written as rational functions of @xmath186 , each exhibiting similar properties .",
    "since @xmath186 is essentially one instance of a ratio as presented in , we shall investigate each of the three cases .",

    "one can furthermore repeat the argument with the assumption @xmath207 to show that the nonlinear weights converge to the inner scheme in all appropriate cases . at the same time the scheme maintains the basic functionality of weno - js .",
    "we conclude that the embedded weno - js scheme given by and using @xmath181 is equivalent to the standard weno - js scheme for smooth solutions or discontinuities contained in @xmath58 .",

    "an embedded weno scheme provides us with the possibility to also choose the weights in the limit of large @xmath186 .",
    "one further interesting note is that near critical points with @xmath116 , where @xmath210 ( @xmath17 ) , the embedded weno - js scheme with @xmath181 should also provide @xmath211 . instead of",

    "one feature which is immediately clear from the figures , is that the weights of the weno-45 scheme oscillate with a smaller amplitude around the linear weights .",
    "however , this is merely a side - effect , although a pleasant one .",
    "being closer to the linear weights is in general a good thing , as this directly influences the error terms when comparing the numerical solution to the exact one .",
    "although the order of convergence will not be influenced , smaller distance to the linear weights means smaller constants in the error expansion .      a more contemporary version of a weno scheme is represented by the weno - z scheme of borges et al .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the weno - js scheme has the property that @xmath195 for smooth solutions .",
    "although popular , one can show that near points where @xmath222 , the weno - js scheme only provides third - order accuracy , as pointed out by henrick et al .",
    "the weno - z scheme corrects for this flaw by having @xmath223 for smooth solutions .",
    "consequently , at points where @xmath213 , the weno - z scheme has @xmath224 , which results in fourth - order accuracy .",
    "a side - effect of the new weights is faster convergence to the linear weights in smooth regions .",
    "this also results in sharper resolution of discontinuities .",

    "embedding an inner scheme into the weno - z scheme is somewhat easier , since the weno - z scheme is already in the second general form . in the context of our framework",
    ", we have to satisfy the consistency conditions , i.e. , @xmath229 for @xmath17 . at the same time",
    ", we can obtain extra equations from , where we find the fourth - order term must cancel out as well , i.e. , @xmath230 by corollary [ cor : embedding_equations ] , the two equations in are also valid for weno - z .",
    "thus , for an embedded version of weno - z , we have six equations from consistency and two embedding equations to solve for nine coefficients , yielding a one - parameter family of schemes , given by    [ eq : weno - z_embedded ] @xmath231    where @xmath232 is the free parameter , with @xmath233 being a good choice . in terms of our definition of a local weno scheme",
    ", we may interpret this scheme as having three different smoothness indicators : @xmath234 , @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "thus , the global information used by each @xmath75 is different from the global information used by the others .",
    "the scheme given by is stable for @xmath237 and @xmath238 , which includes the options presented in table [ tab : relative_proportions ] .",

    "@xmath217 and @xmath218 are indicated ( dashed ) , as well as the inner weights ( dotted ) @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 . ]",
    "a feature that becomes clear from the figure is that the weno - z weights are symmetrical , while the weno - z45 weights oscillate asymmetrically , indicating a preferred direction .",
    "this preferred direction is , of course , towards the inner weights .",
    "as indicated earlier , the relative proportions @xmath111 and @xmath110 can be chosen independently .",
    "thus , we may choose a fourth - order inner scheme on @xmath241 , while on @xmath242 we may place the superfluous weight on the middle stencil . to clarify",
    "which scheme is being used at a particular time , we propose the following notation .",
    "we shall write the outer scheme with the relative proportions in parenthesis : weno - js(@xmath111 , @xmath110 ) and weno - z(@xmath111 , @xmath110 ) .",
    "we write @xmath111 first since it affects the interpolation on the left when the discontinuity is on the right . in special cases",

    "the embedded weno schemes may be investigated by analysing their spectral properties .",
    "the inner scheme activates whenever @xmath205 or @xmath93 become significantly larger than the other two smoothness indicators . in terms of sinusoidal functions",
    ", one would expect this to happen in the medium - range of wave numbers .",
    "thus , the spectral properties of a weno scheme in this regime can be improved by embedding an inner scheme .    as an example",
    ", we will show that we can reduce the dissipation of a weno scheme by embedding an inner scheme .",
    "this is particularly useful when working with smooth solutions . on the other hand , when working with sharply varying or even discontinuous solutions",
    ", one may wish to increase dissipation to obtain greater stability .",
    "one can investigate the spectral properties of a weno scheme by analysing the underlying linear schemes @xcite .",
    "we can interpret the weno schemes as a linear combination of the underlying third - order upwind schemes , where the weights vary with the wave numbers .",
    "this way , we may find upper and lower bounds for the spectral curves .",
    "we consider here plane wave solutions to the linear advection equation , @xmath243 we can relate the numerical solution obtained by the underlying linear schemes to a plane wave solution @xmath244 .",
    "after some manipulation , we find the amplification factor @xmath245 , which is a complex quantity related to the spectral properties of the scheme .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath245 determines the dissipation , @xmath246 being a nondissipative scheme .",
    "the argument of @xmath245 determines the phase error in the numerical approximation , thus relating to dispersion .",
    "an exact scheme has @xmath247 and @xmath248 , with @xmath249 the numerical phase shift per time step , @xmath250 the cfl number and @xmath251 the exact phase shift .",
    "let us first investigate the basic spectral properties of the three possible third - order approximations and the fifth - order linear combination , see figure  [ fig : base_modified_wavenumber ] .",
    "a weno scheme will give a fifth - order approximation for smooth solutions , while a third - order approximation for rapidly varying solutions .",
    "thus , we expect the weno scheme to follow the fifth - order curves for low wave numbers and the third - order curves for high wave numbers .",
    "these considerations give us a qualitative understanding of weno methods .",
    "the embedded methods will switch to their inner scheme for mid - range wave numbers .    )",

    "let us now study the inner schemes , which are four - point linear schemes given by , completed by table [ tab : inner_scheme_weights ] .",
    "the resulting dispersion and dissipation curves are presented in figure  [ fig : inner_modified_wavenumber ] .",
    "an important thing to note is that all inner schemes do not support parasitic wave modes , since @xmath253 across the whole range .",
    "and the green curves work on @xmath254 .",
    "the solid curves represent @xmath255 , the dashed curves represent @xmath256 and the dotted curves represent @xmath216 . ]    what becomes clear from the curves is that one can certainly influence the spectral properties of the scheme .",
    "also , it should be noted that the curve corresponding to @xmath257 gives a dispersion curve which is very close to the fifth - order dispersion curve .",
    "therefore , this justifies this particular choice , as it reduces the phase difference near discontinuities .",
    "we shall now demonstrate the influence of the innner scheme on the spectral properties by some numerical examples .",
    "we solve the linear advection equation using several variants of weno schemes on a periodic domain with the initial condition a sine wave .",
    "we pick as the wave number @xmath258 , thus the initial condition is given by @xmath259 with the computational domain @xmath260 . as",
    "the initial condition is smooth , we shall use the inner scheme to reduce dissipation .",
    "hence , we shall compare the standard weno - js and weno - z schemes to the weno - js(@xmath261,@xmath262 ) and weno - z(@xmath261,@xmath262 ) variants .",
    "for the embedded weno - z scheme , we set the free parameter @xmath263 in , as lower values seemed to incur more dissipation .",
    "we integrate the advection equation for 64 time units using the ssprk(3,3 ) method and examine the amplitude of the numerical solutions , see figure  [ fig : sine_wave_period10 ] .    all the weno schemes are , in this case , still solving with fifth - order accuracy in most of the domain .",
    "the weno - z(@xmath261,@xmath262 ) scheme proves to be the least dissipative , followed by the weno - z scheme .",
    "moreover , for this wave number the weno - js scheme overestimates the solution , as it is reverting to a third - order mode .",
    "the weno - js(@xmath261,@xmath262 ) has the most amount of dissipation , which proves our assertion that the embedded weno schemes suppress parasitic wave modes .",
    "dispersive effects remain minimal in all schemes .",
    "we will now investigate a higher wave number .",
    "we use the initial condition @xmath264    the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : sine_wave_period20 ] . in this case , dispersive effects start to be clearly visible .",
    "furthermore , due to the rapid variations , the weno schemes are resorting to their underlying lower order schemes . in this particular example , the weno - js(@xmath261,@xmath262 ) and weno - z schemes exhibit so much dissipation that the solution has completely damped out .",
    "the weno - z(@xmath261,@xmath262 ) scheme still shows some of the oscillations , which means that the inner scheme causes a decrease in dissipation .",
    "as a final demonstration of the embedded weno methods , we will perform some numerical experiments .",
    "an example of a scalar hyperbolic equation and an example of a hyperbolic system are presented .",
    "first , we shall take the linear advection equation with constant velocity field .",

    "we consider the linear advection equation , i.e. , @xmath265 on @xmath266 \\times[0,8]$ ] .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions , such that the initial condition is transported around four times and ends up where it started .",
    "thus , the final state is equal to the initial condition , i.e. , @xmath267 . as an initial condition",
    ", we take the fairly standard test which uses a gaussian , a square , a triangle and half an ellipse .",
    "this setup is sometimes referred to as the shu linear test , introduced in @xcite .",
    "the initial condition is given by    [ eq : shu_initial ] @xmath268 where @xmath269 and @xmath270 are given by @xmath271    the parameters are as follows : @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , and @xmath276 .",
    "one of the pervasive features of this test is the compact support of the initial condition .",
    "in fact , the shapes have non - overlapping supports .",
    "thus , we need the numerical solutions to converge to zero as quickly as possible in between each shape . thus , the third - order choice where the superfluous weight is shifted to the middle stencil offers the best choice heuristically .",
    "however , this will also provide more dissipation compared to the other options .",
    "let us start with the embedded schemes that use weno - js as its outer scheme , we expect to see better performance near discontinuities .",
    "moreover , we also expect discontinuities in the first derivative to be captured better .",
    "the shu linear test has both types of discontinuities , as well as smooth transitions .",
