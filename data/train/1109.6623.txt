    "in recent years there has been a great interest in the study of open quantum systems .",
    "the motivation for this upsurge can be found in the recent development of quantum computation and information @xcite ( even though some related aspects have been under investigation from long ago , like in scattering theory , for example ) .",
    "the noise coming from the environment has always been the major drawback for any realistic attempt to implement a quantum computer and a serious obstacle for quantum information purposes . at the same time",
    "we have realized that we know much less about quantum open systems than about their closed counterparts .",
    "therefore , their study has become an extremely active topic in fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "it is in this context and for the case of scattering systems that the fractal weyl law for the number of long - lived resonances has been conjectured and tested by means of several examples @xcite .",
    "the classical invariant distribution in these cases , i.e. the fractal hyperbolic set of all the trajectories non - escaping in the past and future ( the repeller ) , plays a fundamental role with respect to the quantum spectrum of quasibound states ( the resonances ) .",
    "indeed , the aforementioned law says that @xcite the number of resonances that decay at the slowest pace ( the long - lived ones ) grows as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the partial hausdorff dimension of the repeller .",
    "we can trace back these studies to the proposal and proof of a fractal weyl upper bound for a hamiltonian flow showing a fractal trapped set @xcite .",
    "later , results that seem to strongly support the validity of the conjectured law have been obtained for different kind of systems ranging from smooth to hard walls potentials @xcite .",
    "but it is in open quantum maps that the fractal weyl law was more easily tested @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "paradigmatic in the quantum chaos literature , the resonances have been found to grow as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the partial fractal dimension of the repeller .",
    "however , explorations of the spectral behavior of quantum systems having different kinds of invariant classical distributions associated with them are very scarce . in this sense",
    "it is very interesting to ask what happens in the case of a non - projective kind of noise , i.e. , a contractive environment , for example . here",
    "we will focus on dissipative quantum operations , whose action can be interpreted as a phase space contraction leading to dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "there were very few attempts to study the spectral properties of these kind of systems in previous works .",
    "the only antecedent we were able to find in the literature is the paper by ermann et al .",
    "but in this case only the spectrum of a discretized perron - frobenius operator was considered . for this approximation to the classical problem ( i.e. not a proper quantization of it )",
    ", the authors found that the behavior of the corresponding long - lived resonances follow the fractal weyl law .    in this work",
    "we analyze the dissipative baker map . to obtain the quantum counterpart",
    "we have implemented a standard procedure in which the noise superoperator is written in terms of appropriately defined kraus operators @xcite . for this model ,",
    "all classical initial conditions fall on a strange attractor after a few iterations . at the quantum level , this is represented by a resonance with eigenvalue @xmath5 , and the rest of the spectrum lying inside the unit circle . in sharp contrast to what has been found for the discretized classical dynamics , the number of long - lived resonances of the superoperator grows as a power law in @xmath0 , but the exponent is rather insensitive to the dimension of the fractal invariant set .    this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we present the definition and details of the model we have used to study this kind of spectrum . in section [ sec3 ] the numerical results are analyzed and we present an interpretation of them supported by further studies .",
    "finally , we draw the conclusions in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "one of the most simple models one can think of at the time of studying complex systems are chaotic maps .",
    "regardless of their simplicity they capture all the essential features of chaotic behavior and their quantization allows to extend these advantages to quantum mechanics .",
    "all this turned them into paradigmatic models for quantum chaos and the theory of dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the spectral behavior of the dissipative baker map .",
    "the classical map is defined on the 2-torus @xmath6 x @xmath7 by @xmath8 this transformation is an area - contracting , piecewise - linear map .",
    "the map contracts the torus in the @xmath9 direction by a @xmath10 factor , stretches the unit square by a factor of two in the @xmath11 direction , squeezes it by the same factor in the @xmath9 direction , and then stacks the right half onto the left one .",
    "after a few steps any initial distribution falls into a fractal set , the strange attractor .    in an even @xmath12-dimensional hilbert space ( where @xmath13 ) , the quantum baker map is defined in terms of the discrete fourier transform in the momentum representation as @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xmath16",
    "is a unitary matrix and represents the quantum dynamics of the closed baker map .    as discussed in @xcite",
    "quantum dissipative processes can be described by non - unital quantum operations . in this work the dissipative noise is implemented by an @xmath17 kraus superoperator of the form :    @xmath18    where    @xmath19    are operators accounting for transitions towards the momentum state @xmath20 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath21 coincides with the dissipation parameter of the corresponding classical map .",
    "m is a trace preserving ( @xmath22 ) and non - unital ( @xmath23 ) superoperator , which describes a process in which phase space volume is not preserved .",
    "superoperators of this type are obtained from the integration of master equations derived from modelling a microscopic interaction of a system ( an oscillator , a large spin , etc ) with a thermal bath at zero temperature representing the environment @xcite .    to describe the noisy evolution of the density matrix of the system we compose m with the unitary map ( [ quantumbaker ] ) , according to : @xmath24",
    "the spectrum obtained by the diagonalization of the superoperator of eq.([superoper ] ) consists of a leading eigenvalue @xmath25 , and @xmath26 complex eigenvalues @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) inside the unit circle . due to its non - normality ,",
    "@xmath29 has distinct left @xmath30 and right eigenoperators @xmath31 corresponding to each eigenvalue . as expected , the husimi function of the invariant state @xmath32 having eigenvalue @xmath33 , closely follows the fractal structure of the attractor corresponding to the classical dissipative map .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , for several values of @xmath10 . in the classical case",
    "the dissipation parameter @xmath10 determines the dimension of the attractor @xmath34 @xcite . in",
    "the quantum case @xmath10 is related to the quantum phase space contraction rate @xcite .",
    "we have verified that as @xmath12 increases , the phase space representation of @xmath32 reveals finer details of the attractor , reflecting the quantum to classical correspondence .     and @xmath35 ( left column ) , and the corresponding classical attractors ( right column ) . [ f1 ] ]    as a first approach to analyzing the behavior of the resonances , in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] we show different spectra of @xmath36 for three values of the dissipation parameter @xmath37 and a hilbert space dimension @xmath35 . we notice that the longest - lived eigenvalues , though change their position in the complex plane , more or less keep their moduli while the radius @xmath38 of the dense circle where most of the eigenvalues concentrate strongly shrinks for increasing values of the dissipation .",
    "however , this radius can not be directly related to the parameter @xmath10 , in contrast to what is observed in @xcite for the spectra of the discretized perron - frobenius operator .",
    "this gives to the quantum version a seemingly more contractive character in spectral terms .     in the complex plane for three different values of the dissipation .",
    "from left to right : @xmath39 . in all cases @xmath35 .",
    "[ f2 ] ]    to better show this point the differential radial density distributions defined as @xmath40 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , for different values of @xmath12 .",
    "these densities , normalized according to @xmath41 , are practically n - independent for the dimensions we are considering .",
    "they present a relative maximum at a decay rate @xmath42 , and then they smoothly increase at larger values of @xmath43 .",
    "these profiles are very different from the ones obtained in @xcite for the spectrum of the perron - frobenius operator , which peak around @xmath44 , that is , the global relaxation rate to the strange attractor , and decay rapidly for larger @xmath43 .     as a function of @xmath43 for different values of @xmath12 ( @xmath45and two values of the dissipation",
    "@xmath46 left and @xmath47 right .",
    "the densities are normalized according to @xmath48 .",
    "[ f3 ] ]    we now come to the central point of this paper .",
    "we want to see how the differences between a full quantization and a discretization procedure of phase space which are suggested by the comparison of the corresponding spectra affect the adherence to the fractal weyl law .",
    "[ f4 ] displays the fraction of long - lived resonances @xmath49 as a function of @xmath50 for @xmath51 and values of @xmath52 ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that this fraction scales as @xmath55 with an exponent @xmath56 fairly independent of the cut - off value @xmath52 used to distinguish between the long - lived states and the short - lived ones .    ) as a function of @xmath57 for @xmath58 and eight values of the cut - off value ranging from @xmath59 .",
    "the fitted slopes are in the interval @xmath60 .",
    "[ f4 ] ]    the existence of a power law dependence for @xmath61 and the insensitivity of the exponent to the choice of the cut - off value @xmath52 are fundamental properties of the fractal weyl law which has been originally conjectured for projective noises .",
    "however , in the case of our contractive noise the exponent which fits the numerical results can not be related in a direct way to the dimension of the classical attractor .",
    "this dimension is equal to @xmath62 for @xmath46 and thus the relation @xmath63 does not hold .",
    "moreover , the exponent @xmath64 turns out to be practically insensitive to the value of the dissipation parameter @xmath65 .",
    "this remarkable fact can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] where @xmath66 is shown for different values of the coupling constant @xmath67 ( and three choices of @xmath52 ) . in all the cases",
    "the data follow a power law , with @xmath68 , independently of the fractal dimension of the corresponding classical attractor ( @xmath62 for @xmath46 , @xmath69 for @xmath47 , @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) .    for comparison",
    "we have applied the superoperator formalism to the well - studied case of an open baker map subjected to a projective noise modelled by a non - unitary operator @xmath72 , by defining @xmath73 .",
    "we verified that , as expected , the fraction of long - lived resonances of @xmath74 scales with @xmath57 as does the fraction of resonances of @xmath72 with @xmath12 ( we have taken @xmath12 values in the same range than for the contractive case ) , thus following the fractal weyl law .    ) as a function of @xmath57 for @xmath75 , with a ) @xmath76 , b ) @xmath77 , c ) @xmath78 .",
    "the fitted slopes are @xmath79 for a ) , @xmath80 for b ) and @xmath81 for c ) .",
    "[ f5 ] ]    in order to shed more light on these results we turn to analyze the eigenvectors . to characterize the eigenstates of @xmath29 we consider the overlap of the right eigenstates with the invariant state , by defining the measure latexmath:[$",
    "|(\\psi_{\\lambda}^r \\psi_0^r ) | =    dependence of this measure with respect to @xmath43 , for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear that the overlap is in the average larger for slow - decaying states , and decreases as the decay rate increases .",
    "but it is always small , this giving further support to the strong contraction of the spectrum we have observed .     as a function of @xmath83 for different values of the dissipation parameter @xmath37 ( from left to right ) and @xmath35 .",
    "[ f6 ] ]    the distinction between slow- and fast - decaying states is also noticeable if we look at their distribution in phase space . for this , we compute the husimi representation of the right and left eigenstates of @xmath29 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 are coherent states centered at @xmath86 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] for a typical slow - decaying state(upper panel ) the husimi density of the right eigenstate reasonably follows the structure of the attractor ( though being much more localized than the invariant state ) , while the left one has a delocalized pattern . for a state with a large decay rate ( lower panel ) ,",
    "the probability pattern becomes difficult to associate to the attractor .",
    "( upper panel ) and for a state with a large decay rate @xmath87 ( lower panel ) , @xmath88 .",
    "[ f7 ] ]    although the long - lived eigenfunctions are morphologically different from the invariant state , we have verified that they have support on the phase space region corresponding to the classical attractor by making use of a recently developed representation especially suited for open systems @xcite .",

    "[ f8 ] ]    in view of these results we have found that though the classical support of the long - lived resonances is the classical attractor , their number scales with @xmath12 at a different pace than that predicted by the fractal weyl law .",
    "we have studied the spectra of a paradigmatic model of the quantum chaos and dissipative systems theories , the baker map with dissipation , by following a standard quantization procedure based on the kraus representation of superoperators .",
    "in contrast to what happens for the discretized perron - frobenius operator in @xcite , we have found that the standard fractal weyl law does not hold in this case . even if the fraction of long - lived resonances does scale with the dimension following a power law which is roughly insensitive to the cut off value of the decay rate considered for the statistics ,",
    "the exponent ( which is approximately constant ) is not directly related to the fractal dimension of the classical attractor .    in order to give an interpretation for this intriguing result we have investigated the morphology of the eigenstates of the system . in particular",
    "we have built the husimi representation of the projector constituted by the eigenfunctions with slow escape rate @xcite .",
    "we found that its density concentrates on the attractor region , strongly suggesting that one should expect , as for the projective case , a connection between the statistics of these long - lived resonances and the fractal dimension of the strange attractor .    a possible cause for the lack of such natural connection might be in the non - orthogonality of the eigenfunctions localized on the strange attractor .",
    "in fact , the fractal weyl law supposes the quasi - orthogonality of the eigenfunctions supported by the fractal set , since it is based on a planck - cell partitioning of this set .",
    "this works in the case of projective noises , but might not be the case for contractive ones .",
    "this is an open problem and we are currently studying @xcite the degree of non - orthogonality induced by a contractive dynamics as an explanation for the apparent non validity of the standard weyl law revealed by the present numerical investigation .",
