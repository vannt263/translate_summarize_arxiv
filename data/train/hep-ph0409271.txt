    "simple atomic systems like atomic hydrogen , and heliumlike or lithiumlike systems , provide a testbed for our understanding of the fundamental interactions of light and matter , including the intricacies of the renormalization procedure and the complexities of the bound - state formalism .",
    "one of the historically most problematic corrections for bound states in hydrogenlike systems is the two - loop self - energy ( 2lse ) effect ( relevant feynman diagrams in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , and this correction will be the subject of the current paper .",

    "( ii ) _ the numerical approach , which avoids this expansion and leads to excellent accuracy for systems with a high nuclear charge number . over the last couple of years , a number of calculations have been reported that profit from recently developed numerical algorithms and an improved physical understanding of the problem at hand .",

    "* chap .  7 ) and  @xcite ) .",
    "this has recently been generalized to two - loop corrections  @xcite .",

    ", we discuss the evaluation of a specific two - loop correction , which can quite naturally be referred to as the two - loop generalization of the bethe logarithm , for higher excited @xmath0 states ( see also fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the calculation is carried out for the dominant nonlogarithmic contribution to the two - loop self - energy shift of order @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the rest energy of the electron ( @xmath21 is the rest mass ) , @xmath22 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath23 is the nuclear charge number .",
    "the two - loop bethe logarithm is formally of the same order of magnitude [ @xmath19 ] as a specific set of two - loop corrections which are mediated by squared decay rates and whose physical interpretation has been shown to be limited by the predictive power of the gell  mann  low theorem on which bound - state calculations are usually based  @xcite . for excited @xmath25 states ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the problematic squared decay rates lead to an ambiguity which we assign to the two - loop bethe logarithm as a further theoretical source of uncertainty . beyond the order of @xmath19 ,",
    "the definition of an atomic energy level becomes ambiguous , and the evaluation of radiative corrections to energy levels has to be augmented by a more complete theory of the line shape  @xcite , with the @xmath2 state being the only true asymptotic state and therefore  in a strict sense  the only valid _ in_- and _ out_-state in the calculation of @xmath0-matrix type amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "have rather distinct physical origins . in the order @xmath28 , there are two corrections , both arising from hard ( high - energy ) virtual photons .",
    "these correspond , respectively , to the infrared _ convergent _ slope of the two - loop electron dirac form factor and to a two - loop anomalous magnetic moment correction .",
    "the term of order @xmath29 may also be computed without any consideration of low - energy virtual quanta  @xcite .",
    "the terms of order @xmath19 are not the leading terms arising from the two - loop self - energy shifts .",
    "logarithmic correction terms of order @xmath30\\,m\\,c^2 $ ] ( @xmath31 ) have been considered in  @xcite .",
    "it is only at the order of @xmath19 that the low - energy virtual photons begin to contribute to the hydrogenic energy shift(s ) of @xmath0 states .",
    "they do so quite significantly , enhanced by the triple logarithm ( @xmath32 ) and a surprisingly large coefficient of the single logarithm ( @xmath33 ) , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore evident that we need to gain an understanding of all logarithmic and nonlogarithmic terms ( @xmath34 ) of order @xmath30\\,m\\,c^2 $ ] before any reliable prediction for the two - loop bound - state correction can be made even at low nuclear charge number .",
    "an interesting observation can be made based on the fact that the imaginary part of the ( nonrelativistic ) one - loop self - energy gives the leading - order contribution to the @xmath5 one - photon decay width of excited states  @xcite .",
    "analogously , it is precisely the imaginary part of the nonrelativistic two - loop self - energy which corresponds to the two - photon decay rate of the @xmath3 state .",
    "the @xmath3 two - photon decay rate is of the order of @xmath19 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . from a nonrelativistic point of view , the scaling @xmath19 can be seen as some kind of `` natural '' order for the two - loop effect .",
    "it is the first order in which logarithms of @xmath6 appear and the first order in which a matching of low- and high - energy contributions is required .",

    "( [ b60s ] ) .",
    "these results improve our theoretical knowledge of the hydrogen spectrum . on the occasion",
    ", we would also like to mention ongoing efforts regarding the calculation of binding three - loop corrections of order @xmath262  @xcite . at @xmath68 ,",
    "these binding three - loop corrections are of the same order - of - magnitude ( @xmath27 ) as the two - loop bethe logarithms discussed here .",
    "there is considerable hope that in the near future , our possibilities for a self - consistent interpretation of high - precision laser spectroscopic experiments may be enhanced significantly via a combination of ongoing experiments at paul scherrer institute ( psi ) , laboratoire kastler  brossel and max  planck ",
    "institute for quantum optics , whose purpose is a much improved lamb - shift measurement ( @xmath2@xmath3 and @xmath2@xmath139transitions combined with an improved knowledge of the proton charge radius as derived from the psi muonic hydrogen experiment ) .",
    "the comparison of numerous transitions in hydrogenlike systems with theory may also help in this direction as it allows for an evaluation of the proton charge radius using an overdetermined system of equations , provided that theoretical lamb - shift values are used as input data for the systems of equations rather than variables for which the systems should be solved [ see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of  @xcite ] .    finally , we would like comment on the relation of the analytic approach ( @xmath6 expansion ) pursued here and numerical calculations of the self - energy at low nuclear charge @xmath23 , which avoid the @xmath6 expansion and which have been carried out on the one - loop level for high nuclear charge numbers  @xmath23  @xcite , with recent extensions to the numerically more problematic regime of low @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "one might note that traditionally , the most accurate lamb - shift values at low @xmath23 have been obtained via a combination of analytic and numerical techniques ",
    "i.e . ,  by using both numerical data obtained for high @xmath23 and known analytic coefficients from the @xmath6 expansion  @xcite .",
    "( this is one of the main motivations for pursuing both numerical and analytic calculations of the two - loop self energy , in addition to the obvious requirement for an additional cross - check of the two distinct approaches . )",
    "the general paradigm is the extrapolation of the self - energy _ remainder _ function obtained from high-@xmath23 numerical data after the subtraction of known analytic terms ; in many cases this extrapolation leads to more accurate predictions for the remainder at low @xmath23 than the simple truncation of the @xmath6 expansion alone .",
    "various algorithms have been developed for this purpose ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the _ combination _ of analytic and numerical techniques has recently proven to be useful in the context of binding corrections to the one - loop bound - electron @xmath114 factor  @xcite , although direct numerical evaluations at @xmath68 had been available before  @xcite .",
    "still , it was possible to improve the theoretical predictions for the @xmath114 factor self - energy remainder function at low @xmath23 by an order of magnitude via a combination of the analytic and numerical approaches , in addition to the fact that an important cross - check of the analytic and the numerical approaches versus each other became feasible .",
