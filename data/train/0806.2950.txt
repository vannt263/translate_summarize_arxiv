    "ultracold dipolar gases have recently attracted a lot of attention , both from the experimental and theoretical side @xcite .",
    "experiments show that it is possible to cool chromium below the degeneracy temperature @xcite , and by using a feshbach resonance one can reduce the @xmath0-wave contact interaction @xcite such that the physics of the system is dominated by the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction between atoms . these achievements together with the rather remarkable progress in cooling and trapping of dipolar molecules",
    "@xcite clearly indicates that these systems indeed are within experimental reach . particularly interesting in this context",
    "are ultracold dipolar gases in optical lattices @xcite , which offer novel possibilities of studying strongly correlated states .",
    "theoretical studies @xcite , and experiments @xcite on bosons in optical lattices have pointed out the existence of two main kinds of phases : ( i ) a superfluid phase ( sf ) , characterized by a uniform non - zero order parameter , in which particles are delocalized over the whole lattice , and ( ii ) a mott - insulator phase ( mi ) of localized atoms , in which the order parameter is zero .",
    "as soon as one introduces a long range interaction between atoms , new phases appear , both in the sf @xcite and mi @xcite region of the phase diagram : the supersolid phase ( ss ) , which features a non - zero order parameter following a modulated pattern , and the charge density wave ( cdw ) in which the localized atoms follow modulated patterns with a resulting zero order parameter .",
    "these effects are particularly strong in dipolar gases in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that the lower tunneling region of the phase diagram is characterized by the existence of many almost degenerate metastable states of mott - like distribution of atoms in the lattice .",
    "these distributions consist of localized atoms following a specific pattern with a filling factor ( average number of atoms per site ) which is in general not integer .",
    "the large number of metastable states suggests the analogy between dipolar gases and classical complex systems such as neural network models @xcite , or spin glass models @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , classical complex systems , and in particular neural networks , may serve very well as very efficient classical distributed memory models .",
    "they are robust with respect to the damage of part of the network , and they `` recognize patterns with distortion '' , acting as associative memory .",
    "it is natural to ask if these properties could not turn out to be useful also for quantum memories .",
    "quantum memories serve to store in a robust way quantum states , i.e. not only some `` classical '' patterns , but also quantum fluctuations ( see for instance @xcite )",
    ". it would be interesting to combine the best of the two worlds : robustness , associativity and large storage capacity of `` classical '' distributed memories , with quantum stability for the storage of fluctuations .",
    "this is the motivation and far reaching goal of this paper .",
    "the paper itself concentrates on the first steps toward this goal : stability , control , preparation and manipulation of the metastable states in ultracold dipolar gases in optical lattices .",
    "we focus on the _ insulating _ metastable states of the system .",
    "we show how the appearance of these states crucially depends on the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "our calculations on the stability of these states show that their lifetime strongly increases when hopping is suppressed and scales exponentially with the number of sites involved in the tunneling process to other metastable states .",
    "we show that once the system is prepared in a certain metastable configuration , it is necessary to pass through the sf region of the phase diagram in order to dynamically pass from the given metastable configuration to another one , and that this is a quantum controlled process .",
