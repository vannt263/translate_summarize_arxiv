    "strong - interaction measurements at the linear collider ( lc ) will form an important component of the physics programme .",
    "the collider offers the possibility of testing qcd at high energy scales in the experimentally clean , theoretically tractable @xmath0 environment .",
    "in addition , virtual @xmath1 interactions will be delivered free by nature , and a dedicated @xmath1 collider is an additional option , allowing detailed measurements of the relatively poorly understood photon structure .",
    "the benchmark physics main topics are :    * precise determination of the strong coupling @xmath2 .",
    "* measurement of the @xmath3 evolution of @xmath2 and constraints on the gut scale . *",
    "measurement of the total @xmath1 cross section and the photon structure function ; these issues are discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the current precision of individual @xmath2 measurements is limited at best to several per cent  @xcite .",
    "since the uncertainty on @xmath2 translates directly into an uncertainty on perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions , especially for high - order multijet processes , it would be desirable to achieve much better precision .",
    "in addition , since the weak and electromagnetic couplings are known with much greater relative precision , the error on @xmath2 represents the dominant uncertainty on our ` prediction ' of the scale for grand unification of the strong , weak and electromagnetic forces  @xcite",
    ".    here we will refer to the conventional yardstick of @xmath2 quoted at the @xmath4 mass scale , @xmath5 , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "several techniques for @xmath5 determination will be available at the lc :      the determination of @xmath5 from event ` shape ' observables that are sensitive to the 3-jet nature of the particle flow has been pursued for 2 decades and is generally well understood  @xcite . in this method one usually forms a differential distribution , makes corrections for detector and hadronisation effects , and fits a pqcd prediction to the data , allowing @xmath5 to vary .",
    "examples of such observables are the thrust , jet masses and jet rates .",
    "the latest generation of such @xmath5 measurements , from slc and lep , has shown that statistical errors below the 1% level can be obtained with samples of a few tens of thousands of hadronic events . with the current lc design luminosities of a few @xmath6 @xmath7/@xmath8/s at 500 , 800 or 1000 gev",
    ", hundreds of thousands of e@xmath9e@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 events would be produced each year , and a statistical error on @xmath5 below the 0.5% level could be achieved .",
    "detector systematic errors , which relate mainly to uncertainties on the corrections made for acceptance and resolution effects and are observable - dependent , are under control in today s detectors at the @xmath13 = 1 - 4% level  @xcite .",
    "if the lc detector is designed to be very hermetic , with good tracking resolution and efficiency , as well as good calorimetric jet energy resolution , all of which are required for the search for new physics processes , it seems reasonable to expect that the detector - related uncertainties can be beaten down to the @xmath13 @xmath14 1% level or better .",
    "e@xmath9e@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath15 , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 events will present significant backgrounds to @xmath12 events for qcd studies , and the selection of a highly pure @xmath12 event sample will not be quite as straightforward as at the @xmath4 resonance .",
    "the application of kinematic cuts would cause a significant bias to the event - shape distributions , necessitating compensating corrections at the level of 25%  @xcite .",
    "more recent studies have shown  @xcite that the majority of @xmath16 events can be excluded without bias by using only events produced with right - handed electron beams for the @xmath5 analysis .",
    "furthermore , the application of highly - efficient @xmath18-jet tagging can be used to reduce the @xmath17 contamination to the 1% level .",
    "after statistical subtraction of the remaining backgrounds ( the @xmath15 and @xmath16 event properties have been measured accurately at slc and lepi / ii ) , the residual bias on the event - shape distributions is expected to be under control at the better than 1% level on @xmath5 .",
    "additional corrections must be made for the effects of the smearing of the particle momentum flow caused by hadronisation .",
    "these are traditionally evaluated using monte carlo models .",
    "the models have been well tuned at slc and lep and are widely used for evaluating systematic effects .",
    "the size of the correction factor , and hence the uncertainty , is observable dependent , but the ` best ' observables measured at the @xmath4 have uncertainties as low as @xmath13 @xmath14 1% .",
    "furthermore , one expects the size of these hadronisation effects to diminish with c.m .",
    "energy at least as fast as 1/@xmath19 .",
    "hence 10%-level corrections at the @xmath4 should dwindle to 1%-level corrections at @xmath19 @xmath20 500 gev , and the associated uncertainties will be substantially below the 1% level on @xmath5 .",
    "this has been confirmed by explicit simulations using pythia  @xcite .",
    "currently pqcd calculations of event shapes are available complete only up to @xmath21 , although resummed calculations are available for some observables  @xcite .",
    "one must therefore estimate the possible bias inherent in measuring @xmath5 using the truncated qcd series .",
    "though not universally accepted , it is customary to estimate this from the dependence of the fitted value on the qcd renormalisation scale , yielding a large and dominant uncertainty of about @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath226%  @xcite .",
    "since the missing terms are @xmath23 , and since @xmath2(500 gev ) is expected to be about 25% smaller than @xmath5 , one expects the uncalculated contributions to be almost a factor of two smaller at the higher energy .",
    "however , translating to the yardstick @xmath5 yields an uncertainty of @xmath225% , only slightly smaller than currently .",
    "therefore , although a 1%-level measurement is possible experimentally , it will not be realised unless @xmath23 contributions are calculated .",
    "there is reasonable expectation that this will be achieved within the next 5 years  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the e@xmath9e@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath17 production cross section , @xmath25 , on the top - quark mass , @xmath26 , and on @xmath5 are discussed elsewhere  @xcite . in order to optimise the precision on the @xmath26 measurement near threshold",
    "it is desirable to input a precise @xmath5 measurement from elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , the current theoretical uncertainty on @xmath25 translates into @xmath13 = @xmath27 .",
    "hence , although extraction of @xmath5 from @xmath25 near threshold may provide a useful ` sanity check ' of qcd in the @xmath17 system , it does not appear currently to offer the prospect of a competitive measurement .",
    "a preliminary study has also been made  @xcite of the determination of @xmath5 from @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 _ above _ threshold . for @xmath19 @xmath20 500 gev",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath28 due to @xmath26 is around 0.5% .",
    "the limiting precision on @xmath28 will be given by the uncertainty on the luminosity measurement .",
    "if this is as good as 0.5%  @xcite then @xmath5 could be determined with an experimental precision approaching 1% , which would be extremely valuable as a complementary precision measurement from the @xmath17 system .",
    "a giga @xmath4 sample offers two additional options for @xmath5 determination via measurements of the inclusive ratios @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "both are indirectly proportional to @xmath2 , and hence require a very large event sample for a precise measurement .",
    "for example , the current lep data sample of 16 m @xmath4 yields an error of 2.5% on @xmath5 from @xmath31 .",
    "the statistical error could , naively , be pushed to below the @xmath13 = 0.4% level , but systematic errors arising from the hadronic and leptonic event selection will probably limit the precision to 0.8%  @xcite .",
    "this would be a very precise , reliable measurement . in the case of",
    "@xmath32 the experimental precision from lep and cleo is already at the 1% level on @xmath5 .",
    "however , there has been considerable debate about the size of the theoretical uncertainties , with estimates as large as 5% @xcite .",
    "if this situation is clarified , and the theoretical uncertainty is small , @xmath32 may offer a further 1%-level @xmath5 measurement .",
    "in the preceeding sections we discussed the expected attainable precision on the yardstick @xmath5 .",
    "translation of the measurements of @xmath2(@xmath19 ) ( @xmath33 ) to @xmath5 requires the assumption that the ` running ' of the coupling is determined by the qcd @xmath34 function .",
    "however , since the logarithmic decrease of @xmath2 with @xmath19 is an essential component of qcd , reflecting the underlying non - abelian dynamics , it is vital also to test this @xmath19-dependence explicitly .",
    "such a test would be particularly interesting if new coloured particles were discovered , since deviations from qcd running would be expected at energies above the threshold for pair - production of the new particles .",
    "furthermore , extrapolation of @xmath2 to very high energies of the order of @xmath35 gev can be combined with corresponding extrapolations of the dimensionless weak and electromagnetic couplings in order to constrain the coupling - unification , or gut , scale  @xcite .",
    "hence it would be desirable to measure @xmath2 _ in the same detector , with the same technique , and by applying the same treatment to the data _ at a series of different energies @xmath19 , so as to maximise the lever - arm for constraining the running .",
    "simulated measurements of @xmath2(@xmath19 ) at @xmath19 = 91 , 500 and 800 gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ tdralphas ] , together with existing measurements which span the range @xmath36 gev .",
    "the highest - energy measurements are currently provided by lepii .",
    "the point at @xmath19 = 91 gev is based on the @xmath37 technique , and those at 500 and 800 gev are based on the event shapes technique .",
    "the last two include the current theoretical uncertainty , which yields a total error on each point equivalent to @xmath13 = 4% .",
    "it is clear that the lc data would add significantly to the lever - arm in @xmath19 , and would allow a substantially improved extrapolation to the gut scale .     with @xmath38 ;",
    "sample @xmath19 values ( gev ) are indicated.,width=529 ]",
    "limited space allows only a brief mention of several other important topics  @xcite :    * _ hard gluon radiation in @xmath17 events _ would allow several tests of the strong dynamics of the top quark  @xcite : test of the flavour - independence of strong interactions ; limits on anomalous chromo - electric and/or chromo - magnetic dipole moments  @xcite ; determination of the running @xmath26 . *",
    "_ soft gluon radiation in @xmath17 events _ is expected to be strongly regulated by the large mass and width of the top quark .",
    "precise measurements of gluon radiation patterns in @xmath39 events would provide additional constraints on the top decay width  @xcite .",
    "* _ polarised electron ( and positron ) beams _ can be exploited to test symmetries using multi - jet final states . for polarized @xmath0 annihilation to three hadronic jets one can define @xmath40 , which correlates the electron - beam polarization vector @xmath41 with the normal to the three - jet plane defined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the momenta of the two quark jets .",
    "if the jets are ordered by momentum ( flavour ) the triple - product is cp even ( odd ) and t odd .",
    "standard model t - odd contributions of this form are expected  @xcite to be immeasurably small , and limits have been set for the @xmath44 system  @xcite . at the lc",
    "these observables will provide an additional search - ground for anomalous effects in the @xmath39 system . * _ the difference between the particle multiplicity in heavy- ( @xmath45 ) and light - quark events _ is predicted  @xcite to be independent of c.m . energy .",
    "precise measurements have been made at the @xmath4 , but measurements at other energies are statistically limited in precision , rendering a limited test of this important prediction .",
    "high - precision measurements at the lc would add the lever - arm for a powerful test .",
    "* _ colour reconnection and bose - einstein correlations _ are important to study precisely since they may affect the precision with which the masses of heavy particles , such as the @xmath46 and top - quark , can be reconstructed kinematically via their multijet decays  @xcite . * _ hadronisation studies and renormalon physics _ can be explored via measurements of event - shape observables over a range of @xmath19 values .",
