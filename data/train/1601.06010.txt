    "blazar jets have long been considered as candidate sites of cosmic - ray acceleration to the highest energies observed ( @xmath0 ev ) . in the light of the recent icecube neutrino detections , the hadronic model for blazar emission becomes more relevant than ever before .",
    "we compare the predictions of two variants of hadronic models for the the blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) by using the nearby bl lac mrk 421 as our testbed .",
    "we adopt a one - zone leptohadronic model for the blazar emission , where the low - energy emission of the blazar sed is attributed to synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons and the observed high - energy ( gev - tev ) emission is assumed to have a photohadronic origin .",
    "we assume that the region responsible for the blazar emission can be described as a spherical blob of radius @xmath1 , containing a tangled magnetic field of strength @xmath2 and moving towards us with a doppler factor @xmath3 . protons and ( primary )",
    "electrons are assumed to be accelerated into power - law energy distributions and to be subsequently injected isotropically in the volume of the blob with a constant rate .",
    "all particles are assumed to escape from the emitting region in a characteristic timescale , which is set equal to the photon crossing time of the source , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "photons , neutrons and neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) complete the set of the five stable populations , that are at work in the blazar emitting region .",
    "pions ( @xmath6 ) , muons ( @xmath7 ) and kaons ( @xmath8 ) constitute the unstable particle populations , since they decay into lighter particles .",
    "the production of pions is a natural outcome of photohadronic interactions between the relativistic protons and the internal photons ; the latter are predominantly synchrotron photons emitted by the primary electrons .",
    "r0.5     the decay of @xmath9 results in the injection of secondary relativistic electron - positron pairs ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , whose synchrotron emission emerges in the gev - tev regime , for a certain range of parameter values .",
    "@xmath12 decay into very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath13-rays ( e.g. @xmath14  pev , for a parent proton with energy @xmath15  pev ) , and those are , in turn , susceptible to photon - photon ( @xmath16 ) absorption and can initiate an electromagnetic cascade@xcite . as the synchrotron self - compton emission from primary electrons may also emerge in the gev - tev energy band , the observed @xmath13-ray emission can be totally or partially explained by photohadronic processes , depending on the specifics of individual sources@xcite .",
    "the interplay of the processes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : processes ] ) governing the evolution of the energy distributions of the five stable particle populations is formulated with a set of five time - dependent , energy - conserving kinetic equations . to simultaneously solve the coupled kinetic equations for all particle types we use the time - dependent code described in ref .  .",
    "mrk 421 is one of the nearest ( @xmath17 ) and brightest bl lac sources in the vhe ( @xmath18  gev ) sky and extragalactic x - ray sky , which makes it an ideal target of multi - wavelength observing campaigns . using mrk 421 as our testbed",
    ", we present two ways of modeling the blazar sed in the hadronic context , namely the lh@xmath19 and lhs models . summarizes the main features of those models , while details about the spectral shape and variability , the neutrino and cosmic - ray emission are presented in the following paragraphs .",
    "[ table1 ]      in the lh@xmath19 model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , left panel ) the proton synchrotron emission is suppressed , whereas the photopair and photopion components are prominent .",
    "this is the result of a low magnetic field in combination with a high proton luminosity .",
    "the sed does not have the usual double - humped appearance as synchrotron photons from the photopair secondaries produce a broad hump at mev energies ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the energetic requirements of this model are high ( see ) , while most of the energy is carried by the highest energy particles .",
    "although the radiative efficiency of the model is low ( @xmath20 ) , the high proton luminosity leads to a substantial neutrino flux that is of the same order as the tev rays .",
    "interestingly , the expected @xmath21 flux , which peaks at @xmath22  pev , is just under the sensitivity of the ic-40 detector ( orange line ) .",
    "the cosmic - ray proton spectrum resulting from neutron decay peaks at @xmath23  pev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , right panel ) .",
    "this is just an upper limit of what it would appear at earth since we have not taken into account cr diffusion , which is important for energies @xmath24 ev . at any rate ,",
    "our values , even as an upper limit , are well below the observed cr flux at such energies .            in the lhs model ,",
    "the high magnetic field coupled with a low proton injection luminosity leads to a suppressed photohadronic component .",
    "the sed has two well - defined peaks , both from synchrotron radiation of electrons and protons at uv / x - rays and gev / tev @xmath13-ray energies , respectively .",
    "this also results in a low neutrino flux ( a factor of 10 less than the tev @xmath13-ray flux ) .",
    "the peak of the neutrino flux emerges at energies of @xmath25  eev due to the high values of the magnetic field and of the maximum proton energy ( see ) .",
    "the higher value of the maximum proton lorentz factor used in the sed fitting makes the discussion about ultra - high energy cosmic - ray ( uhecr ) emission more relevant .",
    "the propagation of uhe protons in a uniform intergalactic @xmath26pg magnetic field and their energy losses from interactions with the cosmic microwave and infrared  optical backgrounds were modeled using crpropa 2.0 .",
    "the resulting spectra ( blue crosses in right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) peak at @xmath27 eev and they are just below the present uhecr flux limits in the energy range @xmath28 eev .      recently , the variability signatures expected in the framework of hadronic models have been studied in ref .   by introducing small - amplitude variations to one ( or more ) model parameters around their time - averaged values . in particular , the temporal variations in the fitting parameter @xmath29 were modeled as random - walk changes of the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ; here , @xmath32 is a uniformly distributed random integer number in the range ( 0,10 ) .",
    "an indicative example is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : variability ] , where the varying model parameters are the proton and primary electron injection luminosities . a strong correlation between the x - ray and tev @xmath13-ray fluxes",
    "is found in the lh@xmath19 model .",
    "moreover , a quadratic relation between the tev and x - rays fluxes is found , similarly to the leptonic ssc model . in the lhs model ,",
    "the correlation is present but not as strong as in the lh@xmath19 model , while the tev @xmath13-rays vary linearly with respect to x - rays .    -ray flux vs. x - ray flux as obtained in the lh@xmath19 ( left panel ) and lhs ( right panel ) models by varying the injection luminosity of primary electrons and protons .",
    "we considered the cases of uncorrelated variations ( green line ) as well as of correlated variations with no time - lag ( black lines ) and a positive time - lag of 80@xmath33 ( red and grey lines in the left and right panels , respectively ) .",

    "in ref .   the authors have recently searched for plausible astrophysical counterparts within the median error circles of icecube neutrinos using a model - independent method and derived the most probable counterparts for 9 out of the 18 neutrino events of their sample .",
    "interestingly , these include 8 bl  lac objects ( 6 with measured redshifts ) , amongst which the nearest blazar , mrk  421 , and two pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "the ( quasi)-simultaneous seds of those 6 bl lacs , namely mrk  421 , 1es  1011 + 496 , pg  1553 + 113 , h  2356@xmath34309 , 1h  1914@xmath34194 , and 1rxs  j054357.3@xmath34553206 , were fitted@xcite with the leptohadronic model described in section  [ sec : model ] .",

    "# 1    ( # 1 )            according to the model - independent analysis of ref .  , neutrino event 9 has two plausible astrophysical counterparts : the bl lacs mrk  421 and 1es  1011 + 496 .",
    "the differences between the neutrino fluxes originate from the differences in their seds . in this regard ,",
    "the case of neutrino event 9 reveals in the best way how detailed information from the photon emission may be used to lift possible degeneracies between multiple astrophysical counterparts . as the neutrino spectrum for 1es  1011 + 496 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrinos](a ) ) is an upper limit , our results strongly favor mrk  421 against 1es  1011 + 496 .    in all cases ,",
    "the model - derived neutrino flux at the energy bin of the detected neutrino is below the 1@xmath35 error bars , but still within the 3@xmath35 error bars .",
    "although the association of these sources can not be , strictly speaking , excluded at the present time , blazars mrk  421 and 1h  1914 - 194 are the two most interesting cases , because their association with the respective icecube events can be either verified or disputed in the near future .",
    "figure  [ fig : neutrinos](a ) demonstrates that the model - derived neutrino spectra from blazars with different properties are similar in shape .",
    "we may thus model the observed differential neutrino plus anti - neutrino ( @xmath36 ) flux of all flavors ( @xmath37 ) as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is in good approximation equal to the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum , namely @xmath41 . in the above",
    ", @xmath42 is the doppler factor , @xmath43 is the source redshift and @xmath44 is the _ observed _ synchrotron peak frequency .",
    "the luminosity from the photopion component is directly connected to that of @xmath45  pev neutrinos .",
    "thus , our approach allows us to associate the observed blazar @xmath13-ray flux with the expected all - flavor neutrino flux as @xmath46 , where @xmath47  gev and @xmath48 is a factor that includes all the details about the efficiency of photopion interactions ; for example , @xmath49 implies an ssc origin for the blazar @xmath13-ray emission .",
    "the normalization @xmath50 can be then inferred from the above .",
    "the calculation of the neutrino background ( nbg ) from _ all _ bl lacs requires detailed knowledge of the blazar population in terms of @xmath44 , @xmath42 , @xmath13-ray fluxes and redshift .",
    "all these parameters , and many more , are available in the monte carlo simulations presented in a series of papers by giommi & padovani ( e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "we note that the blazar seds in the simulations are extrapolated to the vhe band by using the simulated _ fermi _ fluxes and spectral indices and assuming a break at @xmath51 and a steepening of the photon spectrum by @xmath52 ( for details , see ref .  ) .",
    "we assign to each blazar in the simulation a neutrino spectrum .",
    "since @xmath40 is fully determined for a given set of @xmath53 and @xmath54 covers a narrow range , we are left only with @xmath48 as a possible `` tunable '' parameter .",
    "then , we compute the total nbg as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the differential number counts and @xmath57 are the fluxes over which these extend . to obtain the nbg per neutrino flavor",
    "we divide our results by three .",
    "finally , we perform ten simulations and calculate their average in order to smooth out the `` noise '' inherent to the monte carlo simulations .    the predicted nbg from bl lacs is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrinos](b ) for @xmath58 , @xmath59 gev , and @xmath60 .",
    "we find that bl lacs as a class ( blue solid line ) can easily explain the whole nbg at @xmath61 pev , while they do not contribute much ( @xmath62 ) at lower energies . at @xmath63",
    "pev most of the contribution to the nbg comes from high - frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) ( blue dotted line ) .",
    "although hbl represent a small fraction ( @xmath64 ) of the bl lac population , they dominate the neutrino output up to @xmath65 pev due to their relatively high @xmath13-ray , and therefore neutrino , fluxes and powers . according to preliminary calculations our results up to @xmath66  pev are not sensitive on whether @xmath67 is constant or dependent on the blazar @xmath13-ray luminosity .",
    "however , assuming an anti - correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath68 , we find that the predicted nbg at @xmath69  pev is in tension with the 3@xmath35 icecube upper limits and the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits from ref .  .",
    "thus , this hypothesis is ruled out .",
    "the model prediction on the detectability of 2  pev@xmath70 pev neutrinos for the nbg shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrinos](b ) is @xmath71 without taking into account the glashow resonance ( and @xmath72 , otherwise ) .",
    "this calculation is based on the effective areas from ref .  .",
    "since the model nbg peaks at @xmath73 pev , we expect 2 - 3 additional events up to @xmath74 pev after making an educated guess on the effective areas above 10 pev . given that the 3@xmath35 upper limit for 0 events is 6.6@xcite , the prediction of @xmath75 is close to being inconsistent with the icecube non - detections .",
    "however , @xmath58 is likely an upper limit .",
    "this was derived , in fact , from a small sample of bl lacs , which may represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of neutrino emission , as they were selected as the most probable candidates@xcite .",
    "for example , if @xmath76 then we expect @xmath77 ( 4 ) for @xmath78 pev , which is well within the 2@xmath35 limit for 0 events .",
