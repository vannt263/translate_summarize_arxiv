    "have been achieved in both 3-dimensional and planar circuits  @xcite . in several designs , such as the xmon qubit",
    ", one qubit can be simultaneously connected to multiple resonators and control wires , which significantly improves the scalability and tunability of the superconducting systems  @xcite . in the aspect of detection",
    ", quantum - limited amplifiers were developed to conduct phase - sensitive measurement of the amplitude of the microwave field and test quantum coherence effects at the single - photon level  @xcite .",
    "the technological advancements in superconducting devices provide us with an appealing platform to explore many - body correlations .",
    "analog and digital quantum simulators  @xcite of the superconducting systems have been proposed for numerous many - body effects , including phase transitions in the quantum spin systems  @xcite , topological effects  @xcite , electron - phonon physics  @xcite , and even high - energy physics  @xcite .",
    "the implementation of these simulators can help us understand many - body phenomena that are hard to solve with traditional condensed matter techniques .",
    "given the connectivity and tunability of the superconducting devices , we can also construct many - body hamiltonians that do not exist in the real world , but carry novel many - body correlations .",
    "one such model is the so - called coupled cavity array ( cca ) model , which is composed of an array of cavities each connected to neighboring cavities .",
    "each cavity couples to a nonlinear medium , such as a qubit or a number of impurity atoms . in the pioneer works of refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the cca exhibits the mott insulator ( mi)-to - superfluid ( sf ) phase transition for cavity polaritons , due to its resemblance to the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model  @xcite .",
    "the cca has been thoroughly compared to the bh model in refs .",
    "experimental efforts towards realizing the cca with superconducting devices have also been conducted  @xcite .    in this work , stimulated by recent experimental progress",
    ", we present a multi - connected jaynes - cummings ( jc ) lattice model that demonstrates quantum phase transition for cavity polaritons .",
    "this model is constructed with arrays of qubits and resonators , where each qubit is connected to multiple resonators by exploiting the unique connectivity of planar superconducting qubits .",
    "in contrast to the cca  @xcite , there is no direct coupling between the resonators . instead , the qubit - resonator couplings in this multi - connected model serve both as onsite hubbard interaction and as photon hopping . by varying a control parameter ,",
    "this system can make a transition from the mi phase to the sf phase at commensurate fillings , similar to the cca and the bh models .",
    "more interestingly , as the parameter is varied further , it makes another transition back to the mi phase from the sf phase .",
    "the mi - sf - mi phase transition is due to the symmetry with respect to the left and the right qubit - resonator couplings .",
    "these predictions are confirmed by our calculation of the single - particle density matrix and the energy gap of a small lattice using the exact diagonalization method  @xcite .",
    "this method has been previously used to study the bh model  @xcite and the cca  @xcite , where it gives qualitatively correct predictions of the phase transitions .",
    "we also obtain phase diagrams of the multi - connected jc model in the grand canonical ensemble at zero temperature , which indicate the incompressibility of the mi phase and the closing of the energy gap in the sf phase  @xcite .",
    "note that due to the limitation of the current numerical method , details of the phase boundaries in the thermodynamic limit can not be accurately characterized .",
    "one advantage of this system , compared with a general - purpose quantum computer  @xcite , is that it only requires two operations to demonstrate the phase transition : preparation and detection of the many - body ground state at commensurate fillings , both of which can be realized with current technology .",
    "compared with previous works on the cca  @xcite , our work exploits the nonlocal nature of the qubit - resonator couplings as well as the intrinsic symmetry with respect to the left and the right couplings to study quantum phase transition of cavity polaritons .",
    "this multi - connected jc lattice can be extended to two - dimensional or more complicated configurations to study many - body correlations in bosonic systems .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics of the cavity polaritons in this setup can also be investigated .",
    "we would like to mention that interconnected qubit - resonator arrays with uniform or opposite couplings were studied in previous works that focus on effective resonator coupling and quantum magnetism  @xcite . while our focus here is to study quantum phase transition caused by the interplay of the qubit - resonator couplings , which is distinctively different from that of the previous works .",
