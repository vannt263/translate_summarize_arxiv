    "in the present section we give the details of the simulations : the gauge configurations used , how the quark propagators are calculated , and how these are put together to form the correlators for the hadrons of interest .",
    "we use gauge configurations which include either @xmath24 flavors of non - perturbatively improved clover - wilson quarks @xcite or @xmath25 flavors of slinc quarks @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters of the ensembles used can be found in table [ latticetable ] . as can be seen in the last column ,",
    "the spatial extent of the lattices is rather small . whereas this may not strongly affect tightly bound , multiply heavy systems ( e.g. , @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 , etc . ) , higher excitations and hadrons with lighter valence quarks may `` feel the pinch '' @xcite and this is therefore a source of systematic error which we must keep in mind .    .",
    "relevant lattice parameters @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we reserve this section for a brief discussion of possible sources of systematic errors affecting our results @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 finite - volume effects :    as can be seen in table [ latticetable ] , all volumes are rather small when compared to the dynamical pion masses ( @xmath27 ) , with @xmath28 ranging from 1.71.8 fm for the @xmath25 ensembles to 2.2 fm for the @xmath24 one .",
    "obvious energy enhancements can be seen in some hadrons containing light quarks : e.g. , @xmath29 , @xmath18 , @xmath30 , and possibly even @xmath31 .",
    "we can only imagine how large such effects may be for higher excitations . however , there are no indications that hadrons containing strange quarks as their lightest constituents suffer from these small boxes .",
    "@xmath32 different previous lattice scales ; too heavy @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks :    during the tuning and running stages of the present ensembles @xcite , different scales were used than the one in the current study .",
    "the same was true during a tuning of the charm quark @xcite .",
    "the fact that we now use @xmath35 from the bottomonia system to set the scale leads to a seemingly @xmath36% enhancement of the @xmath34 and @xmath33 ( in the chiral limit ) masses .",
    "@xmath37 for @xmath24 , too heavy @xmath22 quark :    looking at fig .",
    "[ mkin_1 mm ] , one can see that on the @xmath24 ensemble , @xmath38 is too large ( by @xmath36% ) for the bottom quark .",
    "@xmath39 different smearings ; different excited - state `` contamination '' :    on ensembles * c * and * d * , much less smearing was chosen for the light and strange quarks in an attempt to better identify excited states .",
    "however , this may lead to different levels of contamination from excited states when considering the ratios of smeared - smeared correlators on the different ensembles leading to the @xmath25 chiral limit .",
    "@xmath40 relatively heavy @xmath41 quarks ; long chiral extrapolations :    for many systems considered herein , this one is not so much a systematic error , outside of the fact that it systematically causes larger errors in the chiral limit .",
    "more trouble arises from this when the system considered should cross a threshold between ensemble * b * and the chiral limit .",
    "we have presented the heavy - hadron spectrum arising from nrqcd - approximated @xmath22 quarks and improved clover - wilson @xmath42 quarks on @xmath24 and @xmath43 lattices . singly , doubly , and triply heavy ( @xmath44 ) systems were considered and results were found for spin splittings , alternate parities , and in some cases , `` radial '' excitations .",
    "relative mass differences between mesons and baryons resulting from the exchange of one @xmath22 quark for a lighter one were presented as well .",
    "a number of systematics were pointed out ( e.g. , small volumes ; see above ) , but these have not been fully quantified and the reader must use some caution with the results . perhaps more trustworthy are the lower - lying spectra ( no radial excitations ) of hadrons containing only @xmath22 , @xmath34 , or @xmath33 valence quarks . a more careful analysis of all the data generated ( e.g. , with @xmath45 or the @xmath46 , @xmath24 correlators ) and further runs on existing @xmath47",
    ", @xmath25 ensembles could uncover more about the errors incurred , and an expansion of the code @xcite could lead to a study of possible @xmath48 states , but we must excuse ourselves from taking this project further as we have precious little free time and have found new ways in which to be wrong @xcite .",
    "light - quark propagators were generated with the use of the chroma @xcite software library .",
    "we thank our colleagues for saving the light- and strange - quark propagator files on ensembles * a * , * b * , and * e * @xcite and for making them available to the group at large .",
    "we would like to thank s.  gutzwiller and r.  schiel for help in checking that we were properly reading the light - quark propagator files and j.  najjar for providing initial plaquette results for our @xmath49 values .",
    "we would like to thank m.  gckeler for helpful suggestions on many topics and p.  prez - rubio for useful discussions involving heavy - hadron interpolators .",
    "simulations were performed at the uni - regensburg rechenzentrum and institute for theoretical physics and we thank the schfer and braun chairs for continued access and the administrators for keeping the machines running smoothly . this work was supported in part by the dfg ( sfb tr-55 ) and mostly by a patient family . beyond the scope of this project , we would like to thank those who still deem it worthwhile to discuss physics with the unaffiliated . in the end",
    ", it must be admitted that the author has been in this place too long , rendering him a cynic @xcite .",
    "apologies for where it shows .",
    "excuse the curt presentation in places , but this is as much exodus as it is catharsis and the later - written parts of the manuscript will show it . initially intended as part of a larger study with larger lattices , these results have been sitting around partially analyzed for a while , but they may have retained some relevance . as it always should be , use or damn what you will .",
