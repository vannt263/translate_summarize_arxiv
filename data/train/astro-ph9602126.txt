    "bal qsos show broad absorption troughs attributed to rapidly outflowing gas , of unknown origin , located outside the continuum source and the broad emission - line region .",
    "bals typically occur in , c iv 1549 , si iv 1400 ,",
    "n v 1240 , o vi 1034 , and sometimes mg ii 2798 and al iii 1857 ( see reviews by weymann , turnshek , and christiansen 1985 , `` wtc '' ; and turnshek 1988 , 1995 ) . bals often set in at the systemic velocity of the qso , but in some objects `` detached '' bals begin at a velocities up to @xmath0 .",
    "the absorption often extends to velocities @xmath1 , with varying degrees of structure and residual intensity through the line profile .",
    "the derived column densities for the absorbing ions ( e.g. , c@xmath2 ) are @xmath3  .",
    "bals occur in about 10 percent of radio quiet qsos ( weymann  1991 ) and rarely in radio loud qsos . either most radio quiet qsos have bal material covering about 10 percent of the sky as seen from the continuum source , or a subset of qsos have bal regions with a larger covering factor .",
    "the bal region may have a disk - like geometry ( turnshek 1995 ; goodrich and miller 1995 ) .",
    "the absorbing material must have a transverse dimension @xmath4 cm , sufficient to cover the continuum source .",
    "the n v bal often strongly absorbs the  emission line , implying a radius @xmath5 cm ( turnshek  1996 ) . the absorbing clouds , which occupy only a tiny fraction of the volume , may be accelerated by radiation pressure involving the resonance lines or by ram pressure of a fast moving wind ( wtc ) . proposed",
    "sources for the bal gas include winds from red giant stars ( scoville and norman 1995 ) or from a supermassive accretion disk ( murray  1995 ) .",
    "the bal gas has remarkably high abundances of heavy elements , relative to hydrogen .",
    "the abundances are derived from column densities of ions ( in turn derived from observed bal optical depths ) together with photoionization models of the ionization equilibrium .",
    "junkkarinen  ( 1987 ) argued for a minimum ( si / h ) @xmath6 10(si / h)@xmath7 for their sample of bal qsos , and their discussion suggests a likely value ( si / h ) @xmath8 25(si / h)@xmath7 .",
    "turnshek ( 1987 ) reported a c / h ratio 10 to 100 times the solar value in q0932 + 501 ( see also wtc ) ; and for q1413 + 113 , they found that s / c and either p / c or fe / c are at least 100 times solar . for q0226 - 1024 ,",
    "korista  ( 1992 , 1995 ) found a heavy element abundance z / z@xmath9 5 to 10 , in the context of an assumed chemical evolution scenario . analyzing the same observations of q0226 - 1024 , turnshek  ( 1996 ) developed atwo component photoionization model that gave ratios @xmath10 4 , 3 , 9 , and 120 times solar for n / o , n / si , n / c , and n / h respectively ( best fit model ) . enhancements of other elements , including s and ar ,",
    "are observed in some cases ( turnshek 1995 ) .",
    "remarkably , p / c is @xmath11 times the solar value in pg 0946 + 301 ( junkkarinen  1995 ; junkkarinen 1995 ) .",
    "the heavy element enhancements can be reduced , but not eliminated , by using complicated shapes for the ionizing continuum ( wtc ) .",
    "novae show very large enhancements of c , n , o and sometimes ne , mg , al , si , s , ar , ca , and fe ( andre  1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "novae are produced by thermonuclear explosions on the surface of white dwarf stars accreting hydrogen rich gas from a close companion star ( see review by starrfield 1989 ) . the ejected gas is enriched with heavy elements mixed in from the white dwarf .",
    "enhancements of ne and heavier elements , observed in `` neon novae '' , are attributed to events on o - ne - mg white dwarfs ( politano  1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "hydrogen burning leads to especially large enhancements of nitrogen , and in the case of o - ne - mg white dwarfs , heavier odd numbered elements .",
    "1 illustrates the abundances in a set of novae , determined in a uniform manner by andre  ( 1994 ) .",
    "abundances of c , o , and si are typically enhanced by one to two orders - of - magnitude , compared with solar values ; and n / h is enhanced by two to three orders - of - magnitude .",
    "i have estimated abundances for several bal qsos by assuming that their elemental abundance ratios scale from those given by turnshek  ( 1996 ) for q0226 - 1024 in proportion to the corresponding ionic column densities .",
    "( this assumes that the ionization corrections are similar in all these objects .",
    "column density ratios for ions of a single element are generally unavailable to constrain models for individual objects . )",
    "column densities were taken from junkkarinen  ( 1987 ) for 5 bal qsos and from junkkarinen ( 1995 ) and co - workers for q0946 + 301 .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting abundance ratios along with a value ( c / h ) = 30(c / h)@xmath7 for q0932 + 501 ( turnshek  1987 ) .",
    "the abundance distributions for c , n , o , and si for novae and bal qsos are similar .",
    "politano  ( 1995 ) predict p / c ratios of @xmath10 50 and 300 times solar for nova explosions on o - ne - mg white dwarfs with masses of 1.25 and 1.35 , respectively , bracketing the value for pg0946 + 301 .",
    "these results suggest that the bal gas may come from novae in a massive star cluster in the active galactic nucleus .",
    "high si / c and p / c in bal qsos suggests that neon novae are typically involved .",
    "if o - ne - mg white dwarfs come only from progenitors of mass 810  ( nomoto 1984 ) , they should be only a few percent of galactic white dwarfs .",
    "truran and livio ( 1986 ) attempted to explain the high observed incidence of neon novae in the galaxy in terms of a small accreted mass per outburst .",
    "however , observed masses of neon nova shells are @xmath12 ( e.g. , shore   1993 ) , so another explanation may be needed .",
    "if o - ne - mg white dwarfs come from progenitors down to @xmath13 ( chiosi  1989 ) , these would be a large fraction of all white dwarfs for a cluster age @xmath14 yr , the likely duration of a qso episode ( norman and scoville 1988 ) .",
    "alternatively , perhaps nuclear burning to high atomic numbers , which politano  ( 1995 ) find only for the most massive white dwarfs , actually occurs for lower masses as well . finally ,",
    "if the bal geometry is such that debris of different novae are comingled , as might occur in the disk geometry of section 4 , neon novae could contribute heavier elements to the mix .",
    "the heavy element abundances in the broad emission - line gas of qsos may be up to an order of magnitude higher than solar , relative to hydrogen ( hamann and ferland  1993 ) , but apparently are not so high as in the bal gas .",
    "the emission - line abundances have been attributed to rapid chemical evolution involving the usual stellar sources of heavy elements ( hamann and ferland 1993 ) , and this would not explain high p / c .",
    "this suggests that the two regions likely have different origins .",
    "novae are minor sources of interstellar gas in the galaxy .",
    "can they nevertheless be the dominant source of bal gas ?",
    "we first consider ordinary novae in a massive nuclear star cluster and then the possibility of accretion onto single white dwarfs passing through a supermassive accretion disk .",
    "the mass of a nova shell typically is @xmath15   ( warner 1989 ) .",
    "as the shell expands and accelerates radially outward , it presumably fragments into a collection of clouds or filaments .",
    "we assume that the lateral expansion continues at the original ejection velocity , @xmath16 , appropriate for neon novae ( e.g. , ferland , lambert , and woodman 1977 ; shore  1993 ; gehrz  1985 ) .",
    "the column density of carbon atoms through the debris is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the shell radius , @xmath19 is the mass of carbon in the nova shell , and @xmath20 is the mass of a carbon atom .",
    "therefore , we may write @xmath21 where @xmath22  and @xmath23 . for a carbon abundance @xmath24 , we expect @xmath25 .",
    "assuming that roughly half of the carbon is c@xmath2 , we find @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "this radius is large enough to cover the continuum source and , within the uncertainties , the  emitting region .",
    "as the debris expand , the continuum radiation pressure presumably ablates off material in the form of small clouds , which move radially outward as they are accelerated to the observed outflow velocities (  wtc ) . for @xmath28",
    ", @xmath29 drops to unity for distances @xmath30 from an initial location at radius @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the outflow velocity .",
    "the expected covering factor for nova shells depends on the nova rate in the star cluster in the galactic nucleus .",
    "the covering factor for one shell is @xmath33 , where the second equality assumes @xmath34 .",
    "the number of shells in play at a given moment is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the rate of nova explosions and @xmath37 is the crossing time .",
    "we evaluate @xmath38 for the value of @xmath18 that gives @xmath39 .",
    "this leads to @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the nova rate per year and @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , this result should be adjusted accordingly .",
    "note that @xmath44 varies as @xmath45 , so that events involving a small mass , such as novae , are highly effective for a given average mass - loss rate , @xmath46",
    ". the nova rate in the galaxy ( mass @xmath47 is @xmath48 ( warner 1989 , ciardullo  1990 ) ; and therefore we take @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the mass of the nuclear star cluster in @xmath51  . then we find @xmath52 a ten percent covering factor requires @xmath53 .",
    "analogous estimates of the covering factor for bal absorption due to planetary nebulae , supernova remnants , and `` stellar contrails '' ( scoville and norman 1995 ) indicate that novae are competitive or dominant by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "however , none of these sources match the bal abundances as naturally as do novae .",
    "the mass loss rate in carbon alone can be estimated as @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , this gives @xmath57 . for @xmath58 , the total mass loss rate then is @xmath59 , a rather modest value .",
    "norman and scoville ( 1988 ) discussed a coeval star cluster of mass @xmath60 whose evolutionary debris fuel the central black hole .",
    "the age of the nuclear star cluster is at most @xmath61 yr at redshift @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 gyr , and it could be as young as the estimated qso lifetime of @xmath65 yr .",
    "the `` evolutionary flux '' of stars leaving the main sequence drops an order - of - magnitude as a coeval cluster evolves from age @xmath51 to age @xmath66 years and somewhat further by age @xmath67 years ( norman and scoville 1988 ) .",
    "the effect of this on the nova rate is unclear .",
    "the required star cluster , confined to a radius not much larger than @xmath68 cm , would have a stellar velocity dispersion of several thousand .",
    "the stellar collision time would be shorter than the hubble time and possibly even the estimated @xmath69 yr lifetime of a qso episode .",
    "observations of nearby galactic nuclei offer little support for such massive nuclear star clusters (  lauer  1992 , and references therein ) .",
    "thus , we are motivated to consider ways to enhance the nova rate in qsos .",
    "an intriguing possibility is suggested by the work of artymowicz , lin , and wampler ( 1993 , alw ) .",
    "they consider stars on orbits passing through an accretion disk around a central black hole of mass @xmath70 , accreting disk gas during each passage .",
    "white dwarfs orbiting through the disk will also accrete disk material , and this raises raises the possibility of nova explosions on single white dwarfs that have accreted the requisite amount of hydrogen rich gas (  truran  1977 ) . the circular velocity in units",
    "@xmath51  is @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "the average stellar velocity , @xmath73 , will be roughly @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 be the velocity of a star relative to the orbiting material in the disk .",
    "if the cluster is corotating with the disk , most stars will have @xmath75 substantially less than @xmath73 . for parameters of interest",
    ", @xmath75 is less than the escape velocity from the surface of a white dwarf and large compared with the sound speed in the disk . the accretion rate onto the white dwarf while in the disk is @xmath76 ( bondi and hoyle 1944 ) , where @xmath77 is the mass of the white dwarf and @xmath78 is the gas density in the disk .",
    "following alw , we assume that the disk thickness @xmath79 is such that the toomre ( 1964 ) stability parameter , @xmath80 , is near unity .",
    "consequently , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the disk surface mass density and a value @xmath83 corresponds to the disk s expected vertical equilibrium .",
    "then @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "if the star s vertical velocity @xmath88 is @xmath89 , then the duration of passage through the disk is @xmath90 , and the mass accreted is @xmath91 .",
    "if this much mass is accreted twice per orbital period ,  @xmath92 , then the average accretion rate is @xmath93 .",
    "a typical white dwarf will undergo an explosion at intervals @xmath94 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath95 white dwarfs in the nuclear star cluster ( allen 1973 ) .",
    "( for a salpeter [ 1955 ] initial mass function ranging from 0.2 to 20  and a main sequence turnoff of 1.4  , corresponding to an age of @xmath61 yr , one has @xmath96 . )",
    "let the stars have a typical velocity @xmath97 in the frame corotating with the disk .",
    "then the nova rate for most white dwarfs , with @xmath98 , will be @xmath99 . with @xmath100 and @xmath101 ,",
    "this gives @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we then have @xmath105 however , accretion is most rapid onto stars with small @xmath75 , and these can dominate the nova rate in spite of their relatively small numbers , @xmath106 . if relative velocities down to some minimum , @xmath107 , contribute to the nova rate , then a simple integration over @xmath75 shows that the preceeding expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath38 should be increased by a factor @xmath108 .",
    "if violent nova explosions occur for @xmath109 ( van  den  heuvel  1992 ) , then we may take @xmath110 .",
    "this increases @xmath41 and @xmath38 by an order of magnitude , so that @xmath111 . within the uncertainties ,",
    "this is consistent with the observed 10 percent incidence of bals . for the assumed parameters , novae involving single white dwarfs outnumber ordinary novae by a factor @xmath112 .",
    "indications of a flattened bal region are consistent with novae from white dwarfs with small @xmath113 , which would orbit close to the disk ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the actual nova event would occur at a random place in the white dwarf s orbit .",
    "the association of bals with radio quiet qsos might involve the absence of a suitable accretion disk in radio loud objects , perhaps because the latter typically occur in elliptical galaxies .",
    "in summary , the high chemical abundances derived for the bal region of qsos resemble the abundances of galactic novae .",
    "the mass of heavy elements in a nova shell is consistent with constraints on the dimensions and location of the bal absorbing material .",
    "a very massive nuclear star cluster must be postulated in order for ordinary nova outbursts to explain the observed incidence of bals in qso spectra .",
    "accretion of gas by white dwarfs passing through a supermassive accretion disk can provide sufficient nova outbursts with a more modest star cluster .",
    "observational consequences include a small bal region that could show changes over a few years .",
    "different velocity components in the bals of a given object could result from different novae and show different abundances .",
    "odd numbered elements such as al and p should be especially enhanced in abundance .",
    "this work was inspired in part by the talks by p. artymowicz and v. junkkarinen ( who mentioned high p in nova models ) at the june , 1995 , meeting of the american astronomical society .",
