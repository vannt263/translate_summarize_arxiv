    "the standard timed readout with a frame time of 3.2  s was used , and the data were collected in vfaint mode . a total of 50139  s of on - time was accumulated , while the effective exposure live - time was 49484  s. all data reduction and analysis were performed using the ciao ( v3.0.1 ) , ftools ( v5.2 ) , and xspec ( v11.2 ) x - ray analysis software packages .",
    "no time filtering was necessary as the background rate was stable over the course of the observation .",
    "photon pile - up was not a consideration as the total count rate in the point source of interest was @xmath35  s@xmath16 .",

    "the @xmath37 acis pixels slightly undersample the on - axis point spread function of the _ chandra _  mirrors in the restored images , as the radius encircling @xmath38 of the energy is @xmath39 .",
    "however , the spacecraft dithering and time - dependent aspect solution preclude the need for additional randomization , which degrades a study of faint point sources embedded in diffuse emission .      in figure [ xray_image ]",
    "we compare the _ chandra _  acis image of rx  j0007.0 + 7303  from 2003 april 13 with the combined mos1 and mos2 image from the _",
    "xmm_-newton  observation of 2002 february 21 , originally reported by @xcite . in the _ chandra _  image , 187 photons ( after background subtraction ) are found within @xmath40 of the source maximum ; most are attributable to a point source .",
    "figure  [ radial_profile ] shows the radial profile of the _ chandra_source , with a simulated point - spread - function ( psf ) scaled to the detected counts in the central pixel .",
    "there is also a compact surrounding nebulosity with 136 photons within a radius of @xmath41 ( the pwn ) , as well as a jet that extends @xmath42 to the south , with a @xmath43 bend to the southwest at @xmath44 from the point source .",
    "there is also a possible faint extension of the jet for an additional @xmath45 to the southwest , although the latter may be part of a general expansion of the jet into a large , low - surface brightness nebulosity extending to the west and northwest .",
    "the total number of photons in the jet is 45 after background subtraction . from the vela pulsar ,",
    "similar diffuse emission apparently supplied by its jet has been observed @xcite .    in view of _",
    "chandra s _ unique ability to reveal graphic evidence of a rotation - powered neutron star , we refer in this paper to `` the pulsar '' in rx  j0007.0 + 7303  rather than the customary circumlocution `` candidate pulsar . ''",
    "the acis frame time of 3.2  s does not permit a search for x - ray pulsations in this observation .",
    "from the _ xmm_-newton  epic pn data taken with 6  ms time resolution , @xcite derive an upper limit of 61% sinusoidal pulsed fraction for frequencies up to 83  hz . nevertheless , we regard it as appropriate in cases such as this one to classify an x - ray source as a pulsar even though its spin parameters are not yet known .",
    "the position of the pulsar is ( j2000 ) @xmath0 , @xmath1(see  3 for a description of the astrometry ) .",
    "while the similarity between the jets of rx  j0007.0 + 7303  and vela is striking , it is curious that the prominent torus structure of vela is so much weaker in rx  j0007.0 + 7303 , if it is present at all .",
    "the compact pwn surrounding the pulsar appears to be elongated at an angle perpendicular to the inner jet , which by analogy with vela may plausibly be interpreted as an equatorial torus with the jet emerging along the rotation axis .",
    "figure [ xray_color ] shows the _ chandra _  image in two different energy bands , soft ( 0.22.0  kev ) and hard ( 28 kev ) .",
    "the pwn is more prominent in the hard band , while the pulsar itself is brighter in the soft band , presumably due to the contribution of surface thermal emission from the neutron star ( see  2.2.2 ) , which has a softer spectrum than the synchrotron nebulosity .",
    "apparent spectral differences exist along the length of the jet .",
    "the hardest regions of the jet are closest to the pulsar , while the softest part of the jet is farther away , below the bend .",
    "the features of the lower - resolution _",
    "xmm_-newton  image are roughly consistent with what one would expect from the _ chandra _  image , although the part of the jet past the bend is not obvious with _ xmm_-newton .",
    "it is possible that the structure of the jet has changed markedly in the 14 months between the two observations .",
    "such behavior would be consistent with the rapid changes seen in the jet of the vela pulsar @xcite , which moves with speeds in the range @xmath46 , even in directions transverse to its length .",
    "velocities comparable to @xmath47 were also seen in _",
    "_  observations of g11.20.3 @xcite . at the 1.4  kpc distance of cta  1",
    ", the @xmath42 length of the jet corresponds to @xmath48  cm , or 130 light days .",
    "the length of the vela pulsar s jet is almost the same , @xmath49  cm , which may suggest that the two sources have similar spin - down luminosities .",
    "the bending and termination of the jet can plausibly be explained by its impact against the larger synchrotron nebula .",
    "in addition , if the pulsar is traveling toward the southeast , the low surface brightness diffuse emission to the west and northwest of the pulsar may be due to jet material dumping its energy and dispersing it into the larger nebula , as suggested by @xcite in the case of vela .",
    "source and background spectra were extracted using the ciao script psextract to generate the photon energy histograms and appropriate response matrices for analysis of three spatial regions : the pulsar ( @xmath50 ) , the pwn ( @xmath51 ) , and the jet ( irregular polygon ) .",
    "the pwn region served as background for the pulsar spectrum , while a larger annular background region ( @xmath52 ) was extracted for use with the pwn and the jet spectra .",
    "all spectra were grouped with a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "we first fitted the 136 background - subtracted counts obtained from the pwn region to an absorbed power - law model .",
    "this produced a rather unconstrained fit with @xmath53  @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where the @xmath56 range is given in parentheses .",
    "the unabsorbed flux in the @xmath57 kev band is @xmath58  ergs  @xmath54  s@xmath16 after adding a presumed contribution , scaled by area , from within the pulsar region ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "we note that the best fitted value of @xmath59  @xmath54 is somewhat larger than expected based on the total galactic optical extinction in the direction of cta  1 .",
    "according to the @xmath60 m iras / cobe maps @xcite , @xmath61 mag , corresponding to @xmath62 , which can be considered an upper limit on the extinction to cta  1 .",
    "the @xcite relation @xmath63 @xmath54 mag@xmath16 then implies @xmath64  @xmath54 .",
    "the latter value is close to that derived by @xcite from joint fits to _ rosat _  pspc and _ asca _  spectra , which gave @xmath65  @xmath54 . given the distance and intermediate galactic latitude of cta  1 ( @xmath30 ) , it is plausible that the source lies above the bulk of the dust layer , since @xmath66  pc .",
    "therefore , we adopt a fixed value of @xmath67  @xmath54 in all further spectral fits , the results of which are listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the 0.510 kev luminosity of the compact pwn region in rx  j0007.0 + 7303  is @xmath68  ergs  s@xmath16 . in comparison ,",
    "the 0.110 kev luminosity of the vela nebula within a radius of @xmath69 ( @xmath70  cm ) is @xmath71  ergs  s@xmath16 @xcite , a difference that is manifest in the relative prominence of the toroidal features of the vela nebula .",
    "we next fitted the pulsar spectrum , consisting of 187 background - subtracted counts , to a two - component absorbed power - law plus blackbody model , to allow for non - thermal magnetospheric emission and thermal emission from the neutron star surface , respectively .",
    "the column density was held fixed at @xmath72  @xmath54 .",
    "the best fitted parameters are @xmath73 and @xmath74  kev , with unabsorbed fluxes in the @xmath57 kev band of @xmath75  ergs  @xmath54  s@xmath16 and @xmath76  ergs  @xmath54  s@xmath16 , for the power - law and blackbody components , respectively .",
    "the small effective radius of the blackbody component , @xmath13  km , is similar to the value @xmath77  km from the _ xmm_-newton  analysis @xcite , and might be evidence of a hot polar cap heated by backflow of energetic particles .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite also fitted a light - element atmosphere model with a larger fixed radius of 10  km , enabling a lower temperature to be derived .",
    "such systematic ambiguities are always present in thermal modeling of neutron star spectra .",
    "independent of this spectral fit to the pulsar , we also derive an upper limit to the effective blackbody temperature of the entire neutron star surface . assuming @xmath78  kpc , @xmath67  @xmath54 , and a radius at infinity of 12  km",
    ", we compared simulated blackbody spectra of increasing temperature with the data until the predicted spectrum exceeded the observered counts in the lowest energy bin by @xmath79 , or nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "the resulting upper limit is @xmath14  k. in figure  [ cooling_curves ] , we compare this value with a range of cooling models that include both standard and `` exotic '' processes ( see also @xcite , and the reviews of neutron star cooling by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "recent calculations show that the temperatures or upper limits on all cooling neutron stars , such as vela , geminga , 3c  58 ( psr j0205 + 6449 ) , and rx  j0007.0 + 7303 , can be fitted with models that include proton and neutron superfluidity , and masses @xmath80 @xcite , as shown in figure  [ cooling_curves ] . here , the direct urca process is operating in the more massive neutron stars .",
    "cooling can also be enhanced in a superfluid neutron star by cooper - pairing neutrino emission , which was modeled most recently by @xcite and @xcite .      for the jet we created a polygonal region which encompassed and followed the contour of the jet from @xmath81 to @xmath82 from the pulsar .",
    "a fit to the 45 background - subtracted photons with an absorbed power - law model , with @xmath83 again fixed to the _ asca _  value , yielded @xmath84 and an unabsorbed flux of @xmath85  ergs  @xmath54  s@xmath16 . while there are probably changes in spectral index along the jet that are related to the apparent differences in the soft and hard images ( fig .",
    "[ xray_color ] ) , there are too few photons to fit spectra to multiple regions .",
    "the 0.510 kev luminosity of the jet , @xmath86  ergs  s@xmath16 , is almost identical to that of the main ( inner plus outer ) jet of the vela pulsar , which has @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath16 @xcite . within the range of uncertainty and variability ,",
    "these two sources have jets of equal length and luminosity , which is in curious contrast to the relative dominance of the toroids in vela .",
    "we obtained multiple ccd images of the field of rx  j0007.0 + 7303  using the 2.4 m hiltner telescope of the mdm observatory on 2002 august 26 - 30 . a thinned , back - illuminated site @xmath88 ccd with a spatial scale of @xmath89 per @xmath90 m pixel",
    "was used to cover a @xmath91 area .",
    "the sky conditions were usually photometric enough to calibrate the @xmath92 images with @xcite standard stars , although moonlight prevented us from reaching the deepest possible limiting magnitudes .",
    "total integration times were 100 , 72 , 120 , and 75 minutes in @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the seeing in the final , summed images , shown in figure  [ optical_image ] , ranged from a best of @xmath95 in @xmath94 to a worst of @xmath96 in @xmath97 .",
    "we were able to confirm and refine the astrometric accuracy of the _ chandra _  x - ray image relative to the optical reference frame of the usno - a2.0 catalog @xcite by identifying the counterparts of several x - ray sources in the vicinity of rx  j0007.0 + 7303 .",
    "x - ray positions and counts from the standard data processing , and optical positions and magnitudes from our ccd images , are listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the x - ray centroids and source counts are calculated within the 80% enclosed energy contour of the local point - spread function .",
    "all of the optical counterparts in table  [ tbl-2 ] appear point - like except the first entry , cxou j000647.2 + 730109 , which is evidently a compact galaxy , and perhaps the very faint cxou j000739.2 + 730404 , whose structure is not clear .",
    "the five neighboring sources had mean x - ray ",
    "optical offsets of only @xmath98 in right ascension and @xmath99 in declination , and rms scatter of @xmath100 in right ascension and @xmath101 in declination .",

    "coordinates of the rx  j0007.0 + 7303  point source by the small mean offsets , obtaining a final position of ( j2000 ) @xmath0 , @xmath1 , which we expect is accurate to @xmath103 relative to the optical reference frame .    limiting ( @xmath79 )",
    "magnitudes at the position of the _ chandra_point source are @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "the extinction - corrected limits using the @xcite values of @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath114 , or @xmath115 after correction for extinction .",
    "similar values are obtained in the other bands , and are consistent with an isolated neutron star at the distance of cta  1 .",
    "no extended optical emission is seen associated with the x - ray jet .",
    "the field of rx  j0007.0 + 7303  was imaged at 1425 mhz using the ab configuration of the vla on 2002 may 27 , which gave a beam fwhm of @xmath116 .",
    "an exposure time of 1  hour achieved a @xmath56 noise level of @xmath117jy and a non - detection at the precise _ chandra _  position of the pulsar .",
    "this is equivalent to a @xmath79 flux density upper limit of @xmath118  mjy . the relevant part of the image in shown in figure  [ vla_image ] .",
    "cta  1 was searched for pulsations by @xcite at radio frequencies of 370  mhz and 1390  mhz .",
    "the sensitivity of those observations , translated to a standard frequency of 1400  mhz using a spectral index @xmath119 ( the median for all pulsars ; @xcite ) , was @xmath120  mjy and @xmath121  mjy , respectively .",
    "also , @xcite reached a limit @xmath122  mjy in their search at 600mhz .",
    "our vla upper limit , @xmath123  mjy , implies a luminosity @xmath124 mjy  kpc@xmath8 .",
    "while this is a stringent limit ( the least luminous young radio pulsar known , in snr 3c  58 , has about twice this luminosity ; @xcite ) , there are weaker pulsars known .",
    "we therefore used the extremely sensitive green bank telescope ( gbt ) , where cta  1 is a circumpolar source , to improve on this limit .",
    "we observed the _",
    "chandra _  position of the pulsar for a total of 19.60  hr on 2003 october  11 .",
    "we used the berkeley - caltech pulsar machine ( bcpm ; @xcite ) , an analog / digital filter - bank with 96 channels for each of two polarizations , to record a 48  mhz - wide band centered at a sky frequency of 820  mhz . after summing in hardware the signals from the two polarizations , removing the mean and scaling , the power levels from each frequency channel",
    "were recorded with 4-bit precision to disk every @xmath125s , for a total of 980 million time samples .",
    "[ see @xcite for more details of a similar observation at the gbt using the bcpm . ]",
    "we analyzed the data using standard methods as implemented in the software package presto @xcite .",
    "this involved identification and removal of the worst radio - frequency interference ( much of it generated at the observatory ) , time - shifting the 96 frequency channels to compensate for dispersive interstellar propagation prior to summing the respective samples ( doing this once for each assumed value of dispersion measure , the integrated column density of free electrons ) , performing a fast - fourier transform of the resulting one - dimensional time series for each trial dm after transformation to the solar - system barycenter , and sifting the resulting spectrum for statistically significant peaks .",
    "the last stage included searching for narrow pulse shapes by summing up to eight harmonics of the spectrum ; and also searching for moderately accelerated signals , as might be expected from a pulsar in a binary system , or a young one with a large period derivative .    at a distance of 1.4  kpc ,",
    "both the @xcite and @xcite electron density models predict @xmath126  @xmath127  pc for the putative radio pulsar in cta  1 .",
    "however , the x - ray - measured @xmath128  @xmath54 would predict @xmath129  @xmath127  pc , assuming an average ratio @xmath130 .",
    "also , the maximum galactic dispersion in the direction of cta  1 predicted by the cordes & lazio model is 200  @xmath127  pc , so we searched up to this dm .",
    "although the expected period for the pulsar in cta  1 is @xmath131  s , and almost certainly not less than @xmath132  ms , we chose to analyze our data with much higher time resolution in order to retain serendipitous sensitivity to any pulsars located within the @xmath133-diameter gbt beam . in order to simplify the onerous reduction task , we first rebinned the data four - fold to a time resolution of 0.288  ms , which we kept for the first 240 trial dms , each separated by 0.5  @xmath127  pc .",
    "the effective time resolution at the upper end of this range , limited by dispersive smearing within one frequency channel , is about 1  ms .",
    "we then further halved the time resolution , doubled the dm step , and searched a further 80 time series . in the end , we examined @xmath134 significant signals that appeared at more than one dm , but none showed a true interstellar dispersion pattern that would qualify it as a good pulsar candidate .",
    "we now estimate the flux density limit of our observation .",

    "strictly , these limits apply to relatively long pulse periods ; for @xmath152  ms the limits are somewhat worse , the more so as @xmath153 increases .",
    "taking @xmath154jy as the flux density limit at 1400  mhz for the pulsar in cta  1 implies @xmath155 mjy  kpc@xmath8 .",

    "the @xmath19-ray flux integrated above 100  mev corresponds to @xmath172 ergs  s@xmath16 if isotropic , or @xmath173 ergs  s@xmath16 if beamed into 1  steradian as is often ( but arbitrarily ) assumed .",
    "thus , a prediction of @xmath174 ergs  s@xmath16 is incompatible with isotropic @xmath19-ray emission , and requires a substantial degree of beaming . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath175 ergs  s@xmath16 , then the ratio @xmath176 is only 0.01 in the isotropic case , which is similar to vela , whose @xmath177 ergs  s@xmath16 . note that this argument is independent of whether the x - ray spectrum of rx  j0007.0 + 7303  can be extrapolated over four orders of magnitude in energy to join the @xmath19-ray spectrum .",
    "such a connection was suggested by @xcite , but it is impossible to verify , as well as unnecessary for associating the sources .",
    "the @xmath57  kev power law of the geminga pulsar clearly _ does not _ connect with its @xmath19-ray spectrum @xcite ; rather , they are separate spectral components arising from different emission mechanisms .",
    "the resemblance of the x - ray morphology of rx  j0007.0 + 7303  to the pwn and jets seen in _",
    "chandra _  images of the crab @xcite , vela @xcite , psr  b150958 @xcite , and other newly discovered young pulsars @xcite , enables us to point confidently to `` the pulsar '' in the snr cta  1 even though its spin parameters have not yet been determined .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn from _",
    "chandra _  observations of supernova remnants g0.9 + 0.1 @xcite , ic  443 @xcite , 3c 396 @xcite , and another unidentified egret source , gev  j18092327 @xcite . using clues gathered from its x - ray luminosity , morphology , spectrum , and likely identification with 3eg  j0010 + 7309 , we predict that the spin - down power of the pulsar in rx  j0007.0 + 7303is in the range @xmath18 ergs  s@xmath16 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath14  k that we derive on the effective temperature of the full neutron star surface in cta  1 is more constraining of cooling models than nearly all other cases .",
    "as described by @xcite , x - ray observations do not yet require exotic phases of matter such as pion and kaon condensates , or free quarks .",
    "however , it is necessary to allow a range of neutron star masses if the measured temperatures and ages are to be accommodated by a single equation of state and theory of superfluid properties @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the neutron star in cta  1 is cooler _ for its age _ than most others , and similar to vela and geminga in requiring a mass @xmath178 .",
    "if so , it may become an issue to understand why single neutron stars often have inferred masses greater than the precise values that are measured in binary radio pulsars , which cluster tightly around @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "discussion of that potential problem is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "energetic pulsars are being discovered with extremely small radio luminosities ; whether this is intrinsic or due to beaming remains unclear .",
    "recent examples include psr j2229 + 6114 coincident with 3eg  j2227 + 6122 @xcite , psr j1930 + 1852 in g54.1 + 0.3 @xcite , psr j11245916 in g292.0 + 1.8 @xcite , and psr j0205 + 6449 in 3c  58 @xcite .",
    "all of these pulsars have @xmath180 ergs  s@xmath16 and luminosities at 1400  mhz of @xmath181 mjy  kpc@xmath8 .",
    "such radio luminosities are less than those of @xmath182 of all pulsars , and less than every other pulsar younger than @xmath183  yr @xcite . in comparison , the luminosity upper limit for rx  j0007.0 + 7303  is only @xmath184 mjy  kpc@xmath8 , which makes it fainter in the radio than all pulsars except the nearby geminga and perhaps the putative pulsar powering 3eg  j1835 + 5918 @xcite . if due to unfavorable orientation with respect to the radio beam , the likely existence of a radio - quiet @xmath19-ray pulsar in cta  1 tends to support the outer - gap model , in which the @xmath19-rays arise from regions far out in the magnetosphere and are emitted into a wide fan beam , illuminating a much larger fraction of the sky than does the narrow radio beam .                                                                                                                                            .",
    "a clear excess is seen corresponding to the faint nebulosity at @xmath185 , and additional enhancement at @xmath186 is likely due to the jet and fainter diffuse emission .",
