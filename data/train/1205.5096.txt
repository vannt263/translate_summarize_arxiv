    "in a recent paper@xcite , we reported numerical studies of the anderson model of localization@xcite in the insulating regime .",
    "we studied , in particular , the ensemble - averaged inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , @xmath0 , which characterizes the extent of eigenstates at a given energy @xmath1 .",
    "we found that @xmath0 exhibits a sharp , apparently singular , behavior as a function of @xmath1 , at a specific energy @xmath1 , which lies in the insulating phase , but is clearly distinct from the true band edge .",
    "this sudden change in behavior was interpreted in terms of a sharp transition from a regime comprising for the most part of typical , anderson - localized states , to one comprising almost exclusively states involving resonance between two ( or more ) sites .",
    "such states involving resonance among a large number of sites are known in the literature as lifshitz states@xcite , @xcite .",
    "this aforementioned behavior was seen in one , two and three dimensions for bounded distributions of on - site energies ( e.g. the uniform distribution of width @xmath2 with a constant probability density between the limits @xmath3 . ) , but not for unbounded distributions ( _ e.g. _ gaussian ) .",
    "the apparent singular behavior could be observed most clearly for disorder exceeding a certain , moderate value ( disorder width @xmath4 for the uniform distribution in @xmath5 ) , and appeared to persist for extremely large disorder , where most states at the energies of interest are localized on a few sites .",
    "this provides motivation for studying various quantities analytically for the anderson model defined on a small , finite number of sites .",
    "the simplest of these exhibiting the difference between typically localized and resonant states is the two - site model , which , as we show below , can be solved analytically .",
    "the solution for the two - site model shows that for all bounded distributions defined in the interval @xmath6 , both the ensemble averaged ipr , @xmath0 , and the density of states @xmath7 , exhibit singular behavior at the energies @xmath8 whose value is related to the disorder width @xmath2 by the simple algebraic expression @xmath9 .",
    "the exact nature of the singularity depends on the form of the distribution characterizing the diagonal disorder of the anderson model .",
    "in particular for the uniform distribution of anderson s original paper@xcite , with a step discontinuity at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , both quantities show a slope discontinuity .",
    "this is rather similar to what is seen numerically for the thermodynamic system@xcite , though the energy at which the apparent singular behavior is seen for the thermodynamic system differs from that of the two - site model .",
    "nevertheless , the reason for the discontinuity in slope is found to be the same in the two - site model , namely the loss of certain kind of states beyond a critical energy@xcite , so it is not unreasonable to conjecture that the two phenomena are related .",
    "for other bounded distributions , with power - law thresholds , the singularity for the two - site model appears in a higher order derivative , while for integrable , inverse power law thresholds ( where the distribution diverges at the edges ) , the _ derivatives _ of @xmath7 and @xmath0 diverge at @xmath8 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the n - site anderson model on a ring ( _ i.e. _ , with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "since all states of the anderson model are known to be localized in @xmath5 , this set of models are representative of the localized phase , and also of the true thermodynamic model for sufficiently large disorder .",
    "we then specialize to the case of two sites and present complete results for the ensemble averaged density of states and the inverse participation ratio for the case of anderson s uniform distribution .",
    "the details of the calculation , provided in appendix a , make it clear that a bounded distribution is necessary to obtain singular points for the two - site model .",
    "we then consider other bounded distributions with power law singularities , and demonstrate the singular behavior of appropriate derivatives of @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "details of the derivation are provided in appendix b. in section iii , we present our results for @xmath7 and @xmath0 for the n - site anderson model with a uniform distribution obtained numerically for two values of @xmath2 , representing moderate and large disorder , and show how these quantities evolve with n. finally , in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "the anderson model hamiltonian is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are states localized on sites @xmath14 of a simple hypercubic lattice in @xmath15-dimensions , and @xmath14 , @xmath16 are nearest neighbours .",
    "the onsite energies @xmath17 are independent random variables taken from a specified distribution @xmath18 . by definition ,",
    "we take @xmath18 to be non - zero only between @xmath3 . within these limits",
    ", the distribution can have any form as long as it is continuous and symmetric in energy .",
    "examples are the uniform , semicircular and inverse - power law distributions ( fig.[fig : dist ] ( i ) - ( iii ) ) . later in this section",
    ", we will briefly discuss what happens when @xmath18 is not bounded ( e.g. gaussian distribution ( fig.[fig : dist ] ( iv ) ) ) . in the thermodynamic limit , for symmetric @xmath18 and @xmath15-dimensional hypercubic lattices which are bipartite ( including the nearest neighbour chain that we consider here ) , properties are symmetric around @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetry in energy also holds for finite size systems that have an even number of sites .    , ( ii ) & ( iii ) have power law edges , @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively . on the right is the unbounded gaussian distribution . ]    the hopping @xmath24 is assumed to have the same non - zero value for all nearest neighbours , and zero for non - nearest neighbours . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath25 to define our unit of energy . in one - dimension , which is what we consider in this paper , all eigenstates in the anderson model are known to be localized@xcite for non - zero @xmath2 .",
    "the localization length decreases as the disorder , parametrized by the range of possible values of @xmath17 ( e.g. the width of its probability distribution @xmath2 ) , increases .",
    "the ipr for a wavefunction @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 it is inversely proportional to the width ( support ) of the wavefunction . for localized eigenstates , the ipr goes to a constant as the system size tends to infinity .",
    "as detailed in our previous paper , in the anderson model which uses a uniform distribution , the ipr has a local ( non - zero ) minimum at the centre of the band , rises to a maximum and turns around sharply in an apparently non - analytic manner and goes to zero at the band edges @xmath28 .",
    "we now consider the anderson model for finite lattices . for two sites ( 1,2 ) , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ eq : ham ] reduces to @xmath29 i.e. a @xmath30 matrix , which one can easily solve for arbitrary @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 the ipr for both wavefunctions is the same : @xmath38 which is further independent of x.    the random variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 have a probability distribution @xmath18 .",
    "the ensemble averaged dos ( @xmath39 ) and ipr ( @xmath40 ) are given by : @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath42\\times { } \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } \\bigg(1-\\frac{1}{2(1+\\frac{y^2}{2})}\\bigg)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] transforming the variables to x and y makes the integrals easier to evaluate .",
    "the jacobian is unity , giving @xmath43 .    for @xmath44",
    ", the dos will be two delta functions at @xmath45 . for @xmath46",
    ", the dos goes to zero for @xmath47 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "since the two - site model is expected to be a good approximation for the infinite model only at large @xmath2 , we take @xmath48 from now on .    under these conditions , the integrands in eq .",
    "[ eq : dos ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : ipr ] are non - zero only over the square shown in fig.1 . as shown in appendix a , the arguments of the delta functions in the integrals are just two branches of a hyperbola symmetric about the x - axis , @xmath49 . at @xmath20 ,",
    "it is also symmetric about the y - axis . as @xmath1 increases ( decreases )",
    ", the hyperbola moves right ( left ) as shown in fig [ fig : sqhyper ] of appendix a. any ensemble averaged property of the wavefunctions can be calculated as a function of energy by doing the relevant line integral along the length of the hyperbola lying inside the square .",
    "the simplest bounded probability distribution is one in which the @xmath18 is a constant between @xmath10 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is also the distribution considered in anderson s original paper@xcite .",
    "the complete expressions for the dos and ipr when the probability distribution is uniform are given in table [ table : dos_ipr_expr ] and the derivation is provided in appendix a. in fig [ fig : w2pt25 ] and fig [ fig : w3 ] , we plot ( as solid lines ) the analytical dos and ipr for 2 sites as a function of energy for @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively which agree with our numerical results shown as rightward - pointing triangles .",
    "going from the centre to the edge of the band , the slope of the dos and ipr discontinuously changes sign at @xmath8 .",
    "this can be understood as a loss of typical `` anderson '' type states as follows .",
    ".analytical expressions for dos and ipr over the whole band for the uniform distribution when @xmath48 . here , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the ipr is an average over all the states lying on the hyperbola .",
    "each point in the square will contribute to the average at two different energies , once when it lies on the left branch of the hyperbola and once when it lies on the right .",
    "the states with the highest ipr lie on the upper and lower vertices of the square .",
    "these states occur when @xmath57 is maximum , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 are far from each other .",
    "near the center of the square , @xmath31 is close to @xmath32  wavefunctions arising from these configurations can be called ` resonant ' states .    at @xmath58 ,",
    "the left branch of the hyperbola becomes tangent to the sides 1 and 4 of the square as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this position ,",
    "the maximum length of the hyperbola passes through the high ipr region .",
    "the average ipr will thus be maximum in this region .",
    "however , at any energy close to this , the hyperbola shifts and the high - ipr states start being lost leading to a decrease in the average ipr .",
    "the rate of decrease is different when the shift is left or right , leading to a discontinuity in the slope @xmath59 of the average ipr .",
    "when the hyperbola moves left ( @xmath1 decreases ) , it still passes through a large number of high ipr states .",
    "when it moves right ( @xmath1 increases ) , it loses the high - ipr states much faster , and passes through states for which @xmath60 is large and @xmath61 is small , implying that both sites have energies close to @xmath50 .",
    "these type of resonant states which occur near the edge of the band and arise from clusters of sites which have energies close to one of the band edges , are called lifshitz states .",
    "they are separated here from the rest of the band by the non - analytic point in the ipr .",
    "the softer discontinuity in the dos is only due to a decrease in the total number of states lying on the hyperbola , irrespective of whether they are regular anderson localized or resonant states .",
    "for a non - constant ( but still bounded ) probability distribution , the discontinuity may be present in higher derivatives of the dos and ipr .",
    "as shown in appendix b , the expression for @xmath62 or @xmath63 will have terms of the form @xmath64 with @xmath65 ranging from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "if any of these terms are non - zero at the edge , there will be a discontinuity in that derivative at @xmath8 .",
    "if any of them diverge at the edge , then the corresponding @xmath62 and @xmath63 will also diverge at @xmath8 .",
    "thus , if a probability distribution @xmath68 as @xmath69 with @xmath70 , then all the derivatives of dos and ipr will be infinite at @xmath8 . for @xmath71 positive , the divergence will be in a higher derivative . from the above discussion",
    ", it is easy to see that a non - bounded probability distribution like the gaussian , for which the boundaries of the square lie at infinity , will not exhibit any discontinuities in the 2-site model .",
    "in fig [ fig : w2pt25 ] and fig [ fig : w3 ] , we plot with varying symbols numerical results for @xmath72-site chains for typical values of disorder , @xmath51 and @xmath73 .",
    "these typical cases show how the dos and ipr converge to their thermodynamic limits relatively quickly as @xmath72 is increased , as expected since we are in the localized regime .",
    "larger values of @xmath2 ( larger disorder ) require smaller size systems to reach the thermodynamic limit within a given precision as the localization length decreases with increasing disorder .",
    "thus , for @xmath51 , a lattice size of 100 is required to obtain results significantly closer to the thermodynamic limit than the size of the symbols , whereas for @xmath52 , only 20 sites are required . the discontinuity in the derivative of the ipr survives and seems to grow sharper in the thermodynamic limit , whereas that for the dos seems to flatten out a bit",
    ". there also seems to be an additional feature in the ipr beyond the maximum .",
    "this may be the start of a transition into another regime of resonant states , e.g. from 2 sites to 3 sites . however , this is hard to confirm numerically . interestingly , as would be expected if the above conjecture were true , it is not present in the two - site model .    to measure the evolution of the non - analytic behavior with size , the curves on either side of the roughly estimated maxima of the dos and ipr were fit with quadratic functions up to the points where additional kinks occur in the curve .",
    "the position of the maxima , @xmath74 and @xmath75 were then determined from the intersection of these fits .",
    "the difference of the slopes @xmath76 and @xmath77 of the fits near the maxima were used to quantify the discontinuity .",
    "( @xmath78 ) is shown to reach a constant value with increasing size in fig [ fig : diffslope ] , suggesting that the singularity survives in the thermodynamic limit .    .",

    "fig [ fig : maxpos ] compares the analytically determined point of discontinuity ( @xmath79)in the 2-site case to the numerically determined one in the infinite size limit . for large disorder , the 2-site problem seems to be a good approximation to the infinite size limit , whereas for smaller @xmath2 the deviation is larger .",
    "this is to be expected since increasing disorder leads to smaller localization lengths .",
    "is subtracted from the energy to amplify the difference . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown by direct calculation how the non - analyticity in the dos and ipr arises for the 2-site model for bounded disorder .",
    "further , we have shown the evolution with number of sites for the case of uniform disorder and found an apparent singularity , at least for ipr , surviving in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our numerical studies on different lattice sizes suggest that there is an exact energy at which high ipr states are lost and that the position as well as the magnitude of the singularity approach a limit as @xmath80 .",
    "it is at least clear that the singularity arises due to the bounded nature of the disorder distribution , which leads to loss of high - ipr wavefunctions at a particular energy in the band like in the 2-site model .",
    "the non - analyticity appears to be present for all lattice sizes and we surmise that it survives in the thermodynamic limit . the question of whether it is possible to show that the non - analyticity persists in the thermodynamic limit by analytical means remains unanswered at present .",
    "we also remark that studying a 3-site model may allow us to determine if the shoulders seen in the ipr curves in fig .",
