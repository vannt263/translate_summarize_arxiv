    "activity in galactic nuclei is fuelled by a reservoir of low angular momentum gas , but it is unclear how such reservoirs build up .",
    "fast outflows from ob stars , supernovae or agn activity can clear out nuclear ism @xcite .",
    "gas in the nucleus can also be quickly consumed by star formation @xcite or driven outwards by positive gravitational torques @xcite . if the gas in the reservoir originates outside the nucleus , multiple mechanisms operating on different distance- and time - scales , such as bars feeding nuclear rings @xcite , radiation drag @xcite or interactions @xcite are required . from observations , around @xmath3 of all galactic nuclei in the local universe exhibit low luminosity nuclear activity @xcite , so the mechanism promoting nuclear gas build up is likely to be simple and on - going .    in this letter",
    "we propose a new mechanism for delivery of gas to the galactic nucleus .",
    "we show that the impact of a warm halo cloud ( whc ) , containing @xmath4 , on the central regions of a galaxy will fuel nuclear activity . we develop a simplistic model of this phenomenon to demonstrate its likely importance . while there remains considerable uncertainty in whc parameters , we show that for plausible input parameters , a direct hit by a single whc on the center of a galaxy will supply fuel for star formation and radiatively inefficient accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "since whc bombardment of galaxies must occur , some fraction of the low luminosity activity observed in galactic nuclei must be due to whc impacts on galactic nuclei .",
    "the assembly of gaseous halos around galaxies naturally produces a multiphase medium with warm halo clouds ( whcs ) embedded in a low density hot gas halo @xcite .",
    "whcs could be the local analogue of the high redshift lyman limit systems @xcite . in the halo of our own galaxy , numerous warm clouds",
    "are observed with velocities that are inconsistent with galactic rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "around several other galaxies , hi clouds of @xmath5 have been detected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "extended hi structures ( up to @xmath6 ) are observed out to @xmath7kpc around early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "so , a population of whcs containing @xmath4 per cloud , may be common around most galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . around our galaxy , two basic models can account for the properties of observed high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) : an accretion model based on whcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a galactic fountain model @xcite .",
    "accreting whcs should dominate the mass of clouds in the galactic halo so in this work we shall concentrate on the effects of an accreting whc impact on galactic nuclei .",
    "much of the following discussion also applies to galactic fountain clouds , although that population will have higher metallicity , less mass , smaller radius and lower velocity on average , and will be less numerous .",
    "large uncertainties exist concerning cloud trajectories around our own galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while we might naively expect radial trajectories for whcs , cloud trajectories may become randomized close to a galaxy .",
    "clouds close to the disk become tidally disrupted @xcite , or deflected by magnetic fields @xcite , or disrupted by the kelvin - helmholz instability ( khi ) @xcite and the fragments dispersed about the disk , whereupon the previous cloud trajectory may be irrelevant . since we have no way of predicting actual cloud trajectories , in the discussion below we simply assume that clouds impact the disk randomly .",
    "we start by assuming a initial population of @xmath8 clouds on random trajectories raining down on a galaxy of radius @xmath9 .",
    "as long as the whc radius is larger than the nuclear region under consideration , the rate of impact ( @xmath10 ) of infalling whc of radii @xmath11 on the galactic center is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the typical cloud infall time and the cloud material is assumed to arrive within @xmath14 of the galactic center .",
    "we calculate the cloud impact rate for multiphase cooling around a @xmath1cdm distribution of halos based on the model of @xcite . in this model the total mass in whcs is based on the mean free path of the clouds and the cloud properties we use are the average of some distribution in the halo .",
    "first we calculate the average nuclear impact rate , using @xmath15 , based on conservation of angular momentum @xcite , where @xmath16 is the cooling radius @xcite .",
    "we simplify our calculation by assuming that the whc does not fragment and that infall time is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the maximum circular velocity in the halo .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results](a ) , where we plot impacts / gyr versus @xmath18 for impacting cloud masses of @xmath19 .",
    "evidently the impact rate is relatively flat with @xmath18 ( or equivalently black hole mass ) .",
    "note that a nuclear impact rate of @xmath20/gyr from fig .",
    "[ fig : results](a ) corresponds to a galactic impact rate of @xmath21/gyr or a mass inflow rate of @xmath22/yr if the typical impactor mass is @xmath23 .",
    "this is approximately the low metallicity inflow rate required to explain the so - called g - dwarf problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although observational constraints of cloud impacts are not strong @xcite , we can consider the consequences of whc impact on a galactic nucleus , guided by simulations of hvc impacts with the disk ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the same basic sources of cloud fragmentation in the halo and disk will apply to a whc falling into a galactic bulge .",
    "if galactic nuclei have relatively strong magnetic field strengths in general ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnetic fields will act as a strong brake on infalling whcs and the cloud may fragment .",
    "instabilities in the infalling cloud have growth times of the order of the timescale on which shocks cross the cloud .",
    "this cloud crushing timescale , @xmath24 , is given by @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the densities of the whc and the surrounding medium respectively and @xmath28 is the relative velocity of the whc and the surrounding medium .",
    "if the whc is accreting from a very large distance , @xmath24 can be less than the infall time ( @xmath29 gyrs ) and the cloud can fragment in the halo .",
    "indeed many of the hvcs presently observed may be fragments of initially much larger accreting whcs .",
    "galactic haloes are hot and diffuse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and the disruption of a whc in the halo could create an infalling stringy association of clouds like the hvc a and c complexes .",
    "if the trajectory of such a stringy cloud complex intercepted the galactic nucleus then most of the whc mass could be delivered to the region around the central supermassive black hole .",
    "sufficiently dense and fast clouds falling through the halo and then the bulge ism will first experience deceleration and compression ( pancaking ) , followed by an expansion of the shocked cloud downstream , then lateral expansion and finally cloud destruction when instabilities and differential forces fragment the cloud .",
    "this entire process takes place over a few @xmath24 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "compression will increase the whc density as the cloud pancakes @xcite .",
    "small , fast , dense fragments of cloud can also sweep up large amounts of gas and be shocked @xcite .",
    "the transit time for a whc through a bulge of radius @xmath30 to the galactic center is @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] is a coefficient incorporating slowdown due to drag and magnetic fields . for a galaxy the size of our own(@xmath33kpc ) ,",
    "a cloud with @xmath34 km @xmath35 will take @xmath36myr to cross the bulge and reach the center .",
    "but will the cloud survive this long ? outside of the inner @xmath290.5kpc , the bulge ism in our own galaxy has very low density ( @xmath37 ) @xcite . at these densities ,",
    "the cloud crushing timescale is @xmath38myrs , far larger than the transit time through this part of the bulge . within @xmath39kpc of the galactic center",
    "the bulge ism density increases to @xmath40 @xcite . here",
    "the crushing timescale is @xmath36myr , short enough that the whc will fragment in this region .",
    "so , whcs could survive until they reach the central regions , whereupon fragmentation is likely .",
    "evidently a whc cloud impact could deliver a large quantity of moderate density gas to a galactic nucleus in a single cloud infall . but",
    "what happens once fragments of a cloud of mass @xmath41 arrives in the central few tens of pc of a galaxy ?",
    "low angular momentum fragments of the whc will be captured by the central black hole out to a radius ( @xmath42 ) where their velocity is below the escape speed .",
    "thus the mass captured is @xmath43    we calculate the average @xmath44 for clouds of mass @xmath45 impacting galactic nuclei .",
    "we estimate black hole mass using the @xmath46 relation from @xcite and we assume that the bulge velocity dispersion and maximum circular velocity are related as in @xcite so that @xmath47 which should be valid over the range @xmath48 km @xmath35 .",
    "we allowed different values of braking ( @xmath49 ) , ranging from none ( @xmath50 ) to strong ( @xmath51 ) which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results](b ) .",
    "clearly the braking parameter determines when the average mass captured reaches the total cloud mass .",
    "our model predicts that the eddington ratio will be greatest near a critical value of @xmath18 , where the average mass captured reaches the total cloud mass .",
    "evidently a nuclear strike on a black hole with mass @xmath52 yields much less mass available for accretion onto the black hole , even for large braking ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , a much larger fraction of @xmath53 could be captured if the infalling cloud fragments into a stringy cloud complex in the galactic halo , effectively reducing @xmath11 for a given @xmath18 .",
    "cloud material not captured by the black hole will instead be gravitationally captured by the bulge . in this case ,",
    "the material will either persist as part of the bulge ism or will go down the route of star formation ( with some unknown level of mixing ) .",
    "this is consistent with observations of nuclear activity due to @xmath54 regions predominating in galaxies with smaller bulges and therefore smaller mass central black holes @xcite .",
    "what sort of nuclear activity will result from a whc impact ?",
    "once moderately dense , low angular momentum fragments of the whc arrive in the galactic nucleus , star formation is likely , although dependent on poorly constrained variables such as cooling rate and mixing with nuclear gas .",
    "the arrival of a large quantity of infalling gas may also initiate activity via shocks or gradual acceleration of gmcs @xcite . in our model ,",
    "shocked nuclear gmcs or the highest density , shocked fragments resulting from a whc impact could generate a nuclear ob association within @xmath55myr after impact @xcite . a direct hit by a whc fragment on the central black hole may result in a phase of low luminosity bondi accretion .",
    "@xcite find two distributions of eddington ratios among active galactic nuclei in the local universe .",
    "their first , a lognormal distribution , centered around a few percent of eddington , is associated with nuclear star formation , dominates among black holes @xmath56 and depends critically on feedback from luminous accretion . the second distribution is a powerlaw which occurs in galaxy bulges where there is little or no ongoing star formation .",
    "we will only model the second mode since the first mode has a complex association with star formation , stellar evolution and agn feedback .",
    "although the distribution of dm / dt in this second accretion mode is a powerlaw , we will use the average value from our @xmath1cdm calculations to get an average activity fraction .",
    "we calculate the average fraction of galaxies of a given @xmath18 that are active for impactors of mass @xmath45 and a range of braking and cloud densities .",
    "the lifetime of bondi accretion is @xmath57 where @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the average density of the accreting gas , @xmath60 is the black hole mass in units of @xmath61 and @xmath62 is an average combination of gas speed and gas sound speed in units of 200 km / s @xcite .",
    "the average gas density around the black hole is fairly unconstrained in our model and clearly there is trade off between more massive clouds that take longer to consume and higher gas densities which are consumed more quickly .",
    "nevertheless , in this model the lowest average dm / dt is @xmath63/yr around a @xmath61 black hole , assuming @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : results](c ) we show some average values of braking and gas density that yield reasonable models where on average 1/3 of galactic nuclei are active . for @xmath66 clouds",
    "this requires @xmath67 , while for @xmath68 clouds with some braking this requires @xmath69 , and with no braking , @xmath70 .",
    "recall we are modelling the powerlaw accretion mode of @xcite , which is significant among black holes of mass @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , from fig .  [",
    "fig : results](b),(c ) , our model requires @xmath72 for impactor clouds of masses @xmath66 and @xmath68 respectively . note that in all cases the plot shows a characteristic shape where the average activity first increases as the amount of the cloud captured increases and then decreases as the accretion rate increases for the same amount of captured cloud .",
    "our model predicts that radiatively inefficient bondi accretion should be more commonly detected around larger mass black holes , which is consistent with observations of liner activity in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "future observations of low luminosity activity in galactic nuclei as a function of @xmath18 will be able to rule out certain parameters .",
    "of course if @xmath49 or @xmath59 depend on @xmath18 then the shapes of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : results](c ) might differ .",
    "mhd simulations of cloud fragmentation in the nucleus are required to establish whether the distribution of densities and braking can in fact generate a powerlaw distribution of dm / dt @xcite and we intend to do this in future work .",
    "note that our model of bondi accretion is unlikely to apply for @xmath73 since the dominant activity in that case would be nuclear star formation , which is consistent with observations of smaller mass central black holes @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that luminous accretion can occur in the aftermath of a nuclear starburst .",
    "this may yield the lognormal distribution of eddington ratio observed in a fraction of galactic nuclei @xcite , but establishing this is far beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we expect the number of whcs to increase with redshift as the gas accretion rate onto galaxies increases .",
    "we naively expect the number of whc clouds and therefore the average cloud impact rate to scale with star formation rate or @xmath74 from @xmath75 to @xmath76 @xcite , corresponding to a rate of @xmath77myr for milky - way sized galaxies at @xmath78 . on these timescales",
    ", luminous nuclear activity could result if radiatively efficient accretion occurs onto the central supermassive black hole . a strongly decreasing eddington ratio over cosmic time ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could naturally produce a high duty cycle at @xmath79 , consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : results](c ) . at even earlier epochs ( @xmath80 ) ,",
    "the bulk of the growth of supermassive black holes occurs via mergers in massive protogalactic halos ( @xmath81 ) @xcite . at that time",
    ", gas accretion is primarily on random trajectories , so nuclear fueling by whc impact would be at its maximum .",
    "a natural bridge can then be made to the time before hot halos are established @xcite , when gas accretion is all in the form of infalling gas . in the present epoch , our model predicts that clustering of activity should be random for similar sized galaxies ( comparable @xmath18 ) , since cloud impacts are random .",
    "this is consistent with observations of clustering in liners @xcite .",
    "in this letter we introduce a new mechanism that delivers large quantities of gas to galactic nuclei on astrophysically interesting timescales .",
    "we show that a single warm halo cloud ( whc ) impact on a galactic bulge could potentially deliver a large mass ( @xmath4 ) of gas to the central regions of a galactic nucleus , in a singular event .",
    "although there are considerable uncertainties in the parameters of warm halo clouds , some representative numbers suggest that the impacts occur on astrophysically interesting timescales and at a rate that must account for some or even all of the low luminosity activity observed in galactic nuclei in the local universe .",
    "based on analytic @xmath1cdm calculations of cooling halos , our model predicts an impact rate relatively independent of galaxy mass .",
    "our model also predicts that larger mass black holes ( @xmath82 ) can capture significant fractions of the impacting cloud mass at some critical value depending on the nuclear braking ( @xmath49 ) . at this critical value ,",
    "our model predicts the highest eddington ratios . below this critical mass",
    ", our model predicts that most of the cloud mass will not accrete onto the black hole .",
    "instead , this material will mix with the ism in the nuclear bulge or induce star formation , which may lead to delayed episodes of high eddington ratio accretion .",
    "finally , our model predicts that , for a reasonable range of cloud masses , densities and braking , the fraction of supermassive black holes accreting at very low eddington ratios in the local universe could be around @xmath83 , which agrees with observations @xcite .",
