    "for a few hours after their onset , the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest sources in the far universe . their high luminosity , together with their powerlaw , featureless spectrum ,",
    "make them ideal sources to probe their surrounding environment through the absorption lines imprinted in their spectra .",
    "theoretical studies have suggested that long gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are produced by the collapse of rapidly - rotating , chemically homogeneous , massive stars ( e.g. macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "the association between grbs and massive stars , which has been observationally supported @xcite , makes absorption studies potentially useful as a new way to probe star - forming regions at intermediate and high redshifts , and/or the last hundreds of years of the progenitor evolution .",
    "absorption lines imprinted by the material ejected by the star prior to its explosion allow one to probe the velocity structure and metal content of the ejecta .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy of grb afterglows has been performed in a number of cases ( e.g. @xcite ; prochanska et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , ( 2008b ) ; fox et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; thoene et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; see also whalen et al .",
    "2008 for an extended discussion on absorbers in grbs ) , yielding constraints on the nature of the absorbing medium .",
    "an especially well studied burst was grb  021004 , whose high - resolution spectroscopy revealed a complex velocity structure of the absorbing material , with velocities up to @xmath2 km / s .",
    "the interpretation of these features has been controversial .",
    "initial studies claimed that the high velocity lines were a direct proof of the association of grbs with wr stars .",
    "@xcite argued that the lines must be produced in a fossil stellar wind with hydrogen enrichment from a companion . @xcite and",
    "@xcite interpreted the lines as the result of shells of material which are present around the progenitor .",
    "more recent studies have however cast doubts on the initial interpretation . @xcite performed a detailed time dependent analysis , taking into account the burst flash ionization .",
    "even though they still considered the wind of the wr progenitor star as the best absorber candidate , they pointed out that such an interpretation would require a termination shock at a distance of at least 100  pc .",
    "such a large radius of the termination shock is somewhat at odds with current wind models and could be accounted for only if the progenitor were an extremely massive star evolving in a fairly low - density environment .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 5 grbs with high velocity features ( among which grb  021004 ) . using fine - structure transitions and the presence of low - ionization species",
    ", they argued that the location of the absorber is very likely at a large distance from the burster ( @xmath3  kpc ) , favoring an intervening halo , physically unrelated to the grb , as the location of the absorbing material .",
    "similarly , @xcite modeled fine structure lines present in the spectrum of grb 060418 with a uv pumping model and concluded that the absorbers are at a distance of 1.7 @xmath4 2 kpc .",
    "these results are consistent with a grb completely ionizing the local csm , and with high - velocity absorbers elsewhere in the host galaxy or intervening intergalactic space ( see also prochanska et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) and delia et al .",
    "( 2009a ) for similar findings in the case of other grbs they studied ) .",
    "most of these studies do not take into account the possible shielding effects of an unusually dense csm , as well as any effects due to dust .",
    "additionally , when photoionization calculations are performed , most assume a steady state solution , whereas the radiation fields of grbs are highly temporally variable , with initial burst timescales of a few to tens of seconds , and the afterglow varying over minutes to hours .",
    "disentangling the physical origin of the spectral absorption features seen in grb afterglows is clearly of great importance for a full understanding of the grb phenomenon .",
    "the aim of this paper is a detailed , systematic study of the time - dependent transmittance spectrum of a grb exploding in a dusty circumburst medium ( csm ) shaped by its progenitor star .",
    "recent studies have suggested that long grbs are produced by the collapse of rapidly - rotating , chemically homogeneous , massive stars @xcite . this kind of evolution is believed to take place at low metallicity , where stellar winds are weak and angular momentum loss by winds is marginal .",
    "the wind of numerous types of grb and sn progenitors has been simulated by @xcite , including one model which recreates an anisotropic wind close to the star .",
    "this theoretical scenario has found support in recent observations . @xcite",
    "performed a detailed study of the x - ray spectrum of grb  060218 , discovering a larger than normal n / o ratio in the surrounding of the burst progenitor .",
    "they concluded that only a progenitor star characterized by a fast stellar rotation and sub - solar initial metallicity could produce such a metal enrichment .    in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed and comprehensive study of the effects of the grb and afterglow radiation on the csm structure produced by the stellar wind of a rapidly - rotating , low - metallicity , massive progenitor star @xcite .",
    "we aim at predicting the time - variable , angle - of - sight dependent transmittance spectra of a grb afterglow which resulted from the collapse of such a star .",
    "we study two cases , that of a csm whose metals are initially in the gaseous phase ( i.e. no dust ) , and that of a csm whose metals are heavily depleted into dust prior to the grb explosion . even though the formation and survival of dust in the wind of wolf - rayet stars may seem surprising , dust is observed in wr winds @xcite .",
    "the gas temperature and the exposure to the star s uv radiation make the wind a very harsh environment for dust particles .",
    "if the dust were to share the temperature of the gas phase , the grains would quickly sublimate .",
    "one key ingredient that allows the dust to survive is its capability of radiatively cooling to temperatures lower than the gas in which it is embedded ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even so , there are still many unknown riddles in the way in which dust particles are born and survive in wr winds , but their presence has been clearly detected ( e.g. crowther 2003 ) .",
    "although it is presently unknown whether the particular stellar evolution model that we consider here is truly representative of critically rotating stars in general , we believe that the ability to compare theoretical absorption features with observational data can be potentially useful to the study of both grbs and massive star evolution .",
    "van marle et al . ( 2008 ) computed the evolution of the circumstellar density profile around a rapidly rotating , @xmath5 , low metallicity star ( @xmath1 ) star , which is considered representative of a typical grb progenitor . due to the anisotropy associated with the rotation of the star , the calculation yielded density profiles which are dependent on the angle @xmath6 between the rotation axis ( presumably coinciding with the grb jet axis ) , and the line of sight .",
    "we choose 3 different radial profiles to show the angular and radial dependence in detail , at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 degrees .",
    "the calculations of @xcite provide the density , the radial and tangential velocity @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the ionization state of hydrogen , and the internal energy as a function of radius @xmath12 and angle @xmath6 .",
    "the internal energy is used to compute the initial temperature as a function of radius by means of the ideal gas equation of state with the polytropic index @xmath13 .",
    "the initial ionization state of elements heavier than hydrogen is computed using the photoionization code of @xcite , assuming photoionization equilibrium under the blackbody radiation field from a star with a characteristic temperature of @xmath14 k and a luminosity of @xmath15 , which correspond to the properties of the star at the end of its life as given by @xcite .",
    "the density profile is assumed constant in time throughout the calculation , which is reasonable since the hydrodynamical timescales are much longer than the ionization timescales .",
    "for the same reason , the radial velocities of the gas are assumed constant in time as well .",
    "for the metal content of the csm , we use the metallicity history of the stellar photosphere as calculated by @xcite .",
    "this , combined with the radial velocity information , is used to compute a radially - dependent metallicity profile .",
    "the outer shell , with near - zero radial velocity , has the initial metallicity ( 75% h 25% he with trace elements ) , while the inner region , dominated by the stellar wind , is very helium enriched .",
    "the helium enrichment is due to the rapid rotation of the star ; it causes the star to evolve homogeneously because of mixing , so that at the end of the star s life nearly all of the hydrogen has burned into helium .    for the species that are not included in the calculations of @xcite ( sulfur , argon , calcium , and nickel )",
    ", we assumed a metallicity of @xmath16 with the relative weights of the species as in the solar case @xcite , for both regions of the csm .",
    "the abundance values we used for all 12 species are given in table [ metallicities ] .",
    "the hi column density is about @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    ".abundances used for the outer shell and the inner region .",
    "these are given on a base 10 logarithmic scale normalized so that the abundance of hydrogen is 12 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ lineschosen ]",
    "our calculations were performed both for a non - dusty csm and for a dusty csm . in the non - dusty case ,",
    "most of the inner region is completely or near - completely ionized before the burst occurs due to the ionizing photons from the progenitor star , vastly reducing the signatures of the high - velocity wind close to the star . these features , that is high - velocity lines from low - ionization elements , are instead visible in the case in which metals are initially locked into dust grains and later recycled into the ism by the grb radiation .",
    "the absorption features from the outer shell , on the other hand , are very similar for the non - dusty and the dusty scenarios .",
    "therefore , we present in the following detailed results only for the case of a grb exploding in the dusty csm of a massive star",
    ".    figures [ iondensity_1 ] , [ iondensity_3 ] , and [ iondensity_6 ] display the results of the time dependent ionization profiles for hi , heii , siii , siiii , siiv , cii , civ , and feii , along lines of sights corresponding to @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . to incorporate velocity information",
    ", we show a shaded column density map for each line of sight and a few key ions , with color / shade indicating the observable column density along the line of sight , the y - axis indicating the velocity , and the x- axis indicating time .",
    "a negative velocity here represents a blue - shifted velocity towards the observer .",
    "note that the maximum velocity does vary with angle , as a result of the anisotropic nature of the csm produced by a rotating star .",
    "the displayed times range logarithmically from about @xmath22 seconds to @xmath23 seconds .",
    "there are some common features that are interesting to note .",
    "in particular , the column densities of the gaseous components of the low - ionization states of c , fe and si , which are locked into dust grains before the burst goes off , are negligible at @xmath24 ( explosion time ) , they then increase as the grains are destroyed by the burst radiation and recycled into the ism , and eventually decrease as the ions are photoionized .",
    "this time evolution sequence is much faster at small viewing angles , given the stronger radiation field from the grb .",
    "figures [ spectrumr1_a ] through [ spectrumr3_a ] show several snapshots ( between @xmath25 s and @xmath26  s ) of the normalized transmission spectra for each of the three representative lines of sight .",
    "the times in these figures correspond to the vertical dotted lines in the aforementioned column density plots .",
    "we do not include information at later times because the spectra have stopped evolving at this point , as is apparent from figures [ iondensity_1 ] , [ iondensity_3 ] , and [ iondensity_6 ] .",
    "additionally , we include cross sections across the column density plots for the time steps shown in the sample spectra ( figures [ cross_1 ] , [ cross_3],and [ cross_6 ] ) .",
    "these simply show , perhaps in a simpler manner than the column density maps , the column densities vs. the velocity of the gas for a few selected ions .",
    "we indicate the most notable features in section [ manifestation ] .      to keep these results in context ,",
    "it is helpful to refer to figs .",
    "[ initprofile ] and [ velocity2d ] , since the velocity structure depends on @xmath6 , and also it is helpful to note the location of certain velocity structures since this has a direct impact on the ionization timescale .",
    "for example , along all lines of sight , the free streaming region extends from our minimum radius of @xmath27 cm , and experiences a slow variation in velocity from there to a distance of about @xmath28 cm .",
    "this is the innermost area of the csm in our simulation .",
    "the inner subset of this region , up to about @xmath29 cm , has the highest number density , and a temperature around @xmath30 k ( figure [ initprofile ] ) .",
    "this is the region where the high - velocity features seen in the spectra are produced .",
    "for example , for @xmath31 ( figure [ iondensity_1 ] ) , this accounts for the 3500 km / s feature for hi , as well as the @xmath32 5000 km / s component present in several of the other ions .",
    "as figure [ initprofile ] indicates , there are indeed isolated structures at specific velocities .",
    "the most dominant one is perhaps the least interesting , the outer shell which is nearly at rest ( @xmath33 km / s ) , and is expected by the most basic stellar wind models .",
    "this is observable as the high density feature at the bottom of each shaded column density plot .",
    "equally ubiquitous is a large bubble of shocked wind , which is visible in figure [ initprofile ] as the sudden drop in velocity at about @xmath34 cm .",
    "this region occupies the majority of our simulation space , and because of its very hot , @xmath35 k temperatures , none of the ions that we track are present in this region .",
    "we present the spectra for four different ions where we seek to determine if the velocity structure becomes visible .",
    "first , we note that hydrogen is highly ionized in the inner region and thus is a poor tracer of velocity structure .",
    "however , the outer shell does contribute a large hydrogen component and the near 1215.67 @xmath36 rest frame ly-@xmath37 feature can thus act as a diagnostic of the outer shell .    in the @xmath7 case , ( fig .",
    "[ spectrumr1_a ] ) , we see some higher velocity components for ions associated with dust such as siiii , feii , and civ . these appear only at early times , when the burst initially destroys the dust , releasing si and fe . however , at this head - on angle , the intensity of ionizing radiation is high , quickly ionizing the released ions and destroying this signature of the high velocity wind almost immediately .    in the @xmath38 line of sight ,",
    "the rest frame ly-@xmath37 line exhibits a behavior similar to the @xmath39 case , but on longer timescales .",
    "rest frame and near rest frame features also exhibit a very similar behavior as in the @xmath31 case .",
    "of particular note is figure [ spectrumr3_a ] , corresponding to the @xmath40 viewing angle , in which we see finely structured feii and siiii lines due to the release of gas from dust in the high velocity region of the csm .",
    "these survive on the order of a few seconds before being ionized to higher states .",
    "in this paper we have presented a comprehensive calculation of the spectra of a typical grb which explodes in the csm created by a massive , chemically homogeneous , low - metallicity rotating star .",
    "we have explored both a dusty csm as well as a dust - free one .",
    "these stars are strong candidates for the typical progenitors of long grbs ; therefore , the models presented here , in combination with an average grb luminosity and spectrum , are expected to yield the typical expectations for the spectra during both the prompt and the afterglow phase of the grb .",
    "we emphasize , however , that an accurate prediction can be obtained only from a tailored time - dependent simulation for each particular burst , and hence our results should rather be seen as an example of the overall evolution , whose details will then depend on the spectrum and luminosity of the specific burst .",
    "we have performed the calculation of the transmittance for different lines of sights with respect to the grb jet axis ( assumed to coincide with the rotation axis of the star ) , thus exploring the latitudinal variation of the spectra , which include the @xmath6-dependence of both the csm profiles as well as of the grb luminosity .",
    "the highest velocity components of the csm , reaching velocities above 5000 km / s , exist predominantly at small viewing angles ( with respect to the rotation axis of the progenitor ) .",
    "this is where the burst is most luminous , and thus ionization timescales are very fast .",
    "we do see the presence of several ions at these velocities , but this region becomes completely ionized in a fraction of a second , and an actual observation of the high velocity features seems hopeless , at least for the star considered in this study .",
    "lines of sight at higher latitude are characterized by smaller maximum velocities , with the maximum being around 2800 km / s in the case of a line of sight at @xmath41 . in our model , even at these latitudes , ions with lines around 1000 km / s can not survive the entire burst without being photoionized . from a purely theoretical prospective , the time variability of the high velocity lines , and in particular , the transition from a nearly featureless spectrum to high column density lines back to a featureless or weak lined system like the one observed in our study , is a clear signature that the lines are associated with the csm , and furthermore , that they are due to the destruction of dust in the csm created by the progenitor star . practically , however , observational detection of such variability with current instruments is not feasible .",
    "observationally , high - velocity lines have been reported in grb  021004 by @xcite after about 16 hr from the trigger . from the analysis presented in this paper , we find that these features , if associated with the free - streaming wind of a progenitor star like the one discussed here , could have survived till these late times only if the burst had a very low luminosity .",
    "since this is not supported by observations ( the luminosity of grb  021004 was rather high ) , the only way to associate these lines to a wind is by requiring a very special event , in which the progenitor star would possess an unusually strong wind , and it were to explode in a very low density medium .",
    "alternatively , the observed late - time , high - velocity lines could be simply due to intervening absorbers ( chen et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in summary , during the initial moments of the grb explosion , the optical absorption spectra present a very rich phenomenology due to the different speeds at which the wind components move away from the progenitor side @xcite .",
    "if we were able to observe these early phases , we could derive a wealth of information on the properties of the progenitor stars of grbs . more generally , this would be of great importance to the study of the final stages of stellar evolution .",
    "observationally , however , it is extremely challenging to catch variability on such small timescales , shorter even than the time it usually takes to localize the burst .",
    "therefore we conclude that , if the massive stars progenitors of grbs are indeed of the kind studied here ( as suggested by theoretical investigations ) , then the high - velocity lines produced in their winds are practically invisible , even for very low - luminosity bursts ( such as the @xmath40 case that we considered ) .",
    "the only observational signatures of the grb progenitor stars are imprinted in non - variable absorption lines produced in the termination shock of the wind .",
    "previous detections of high - velocity lines must therefore be due to intervening absorbers , unless the grb progenitor star had extreme properties well outside of the range considered here .",
    "we thank sung - chul yoon and norbert langer for the use of their stellar evolution model , and matt van adelsberg for his calculations of the fraction of excited levels for the most important ions that we considered .",
    "we also thank a very careful and thoughtful referee , whose comments greatly helped the presentation of our manuscript .",
