    "as one of the long - standing puzzles in heavy - quarkonium phenomenology , the polarization of prompt @xmath0 produced with large transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) at hadron colliders has not been clearly understood yet . according to the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) factorization approach @xcite , the dominant production mechanism of @xmath0 with large @xmath5 in hadron collisions is the gluon fragmentation into the color - octet spin - triplet @xmath6-wave heavy - quark - antiquark pair [ @xmath7 that evolves into the meson  @xcite .",
    "because the corresponding long - distance transition preserves the spin at leading order in @xmath8 , which is the typical velocity of the heavy quark of the meson , the @xmath0 should be transverse at large @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , the run ii measurement by the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration @xcite agrees with neither the run i data @xcite nor the nrqcd predictions  , although the feeddowns from the @xmath9-wave spin - triplet states @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 dilute the transverse polarization  @xcite .",
    "the problem has not been resolved even after considering corrections in various aspects   .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to see if nrqcd still confronts with experiments of lower center - of - momentum ( cm ) energies @xmath14 , where the dominance of the gluon fragmentation may not happen .    in this aspect ,",
    "the _ inclusive _ @xmath0 production in @xmath15 collisions at @xmath1gev , where the fragmentation does not dominate  @xcite , at the brookhaven relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) may provide independent experimental constraints to the @xmath0 polarization .",
    "because only a tiny fraction of the phenix inclusive @xmath0 samples contain the @xmath0 from the @xmath16 decay @xcite , we can treat this as prompt @xmath0 . in the case of the cross section , the nrqcd predictions in refs .",
    "@xcite are consistent with the run-3 phenix data  @xcite . as a new production mechanism ,",
    "the @xmath17-channel - cut approach  @xcite , which suffers from a criticism  @xcite , also explains the data  @xcite .",
    "the color - singlet - model ( csm ) prediction for the direct @xmath0 production rate has been computed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling @xmath4  , including contributions from @xmath18 fusion .",
    "the nlo csm prediction agrees with the data for the rapidity distribution , assuming that about @xmath19 of the @xmath0 samples are from higher resonances , while it underestimates the data for the @xmath5 distribution .",
    "the nlo nrqcd prediction has been found to agree with the data for the @xmath5 distribution  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cross section  @xcite , the phenix collaboration has measured the polarization  @xcite of the inclusive @xmath0 . in the midrapidity region @xmath20 , the phenix data for the @xmath0 polarization  @xcite agree with the predictions of both nrqcd @xcite and the s - channel - cut method  @xcite . however , the phenix preliminary data in ref .",
    "@xcite for the forward - rapidity region @xmath2 disfavor the s - channel - cut prediction  @xcite .",
    "the phenix collaboration is currently carrying out a comprehensive analysis with the data from the forward - rapidity region .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to provide nrqcd predictions that can be compared with the forthcoming updated phenix data for the inclusive @xmath0 polarization in the forward - rapidity region .    in this paper",
    ", we present an updated nrqcd prediction for the polarization of prompt @xmath0 produced in the forward - rapidity region @xmath2 in @xmath21 collisions at @xmath1gev .",
    "the perturbative contributions are computed at lo in @xmath4 , like the previous analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the cross section and polarization in the midrapidity region @xmath20 within the @xmath5 range @xmath22 are predicted in detail .",
    "the phenix collaboration is also preparing to release the rapidity dependence of the @xmath0 in both the midrapidity and forward - rapidity regions . in this ongoing analysis",
    ", they are using a conservative lower @xmath5 cut @xmath23 to avoid the region where lo nrqcd may break down .",
    "we also present a nrqcd prediction for the rapidity dependence of the polarization of prompt @xmath0 in the region @xmath24 . except for these changes in the kinematic region ,",
    "our analysis presented here is very similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite so we do not reproduce details of our strategy to compute observables and explanations on the input parameters given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the nrqcd prediction for the @xmath5 dependence of the differential cross section followed by the nrqcd prediction for the @xmath5 dependence of the polarization parameter @xmath25 integrated over the forward - rapidity region in sec .",

    "in this section , we provide the nrqcd predictions for the @xmath5 distributions of the production rate and polarization parameter @xmath25 for the prompt @xmath0 produced in @xmath21 collisions at @xmath27gev . the basic strategy to compute the cross section and polarization parameter @xmath25",

    "the result shows that more than @xmath38 of the prompt @xmath0 s are direct : at @xmath39gev ( @xmath40gev ) , the contributions from direct @xmath0 , feeddown from @xmath41 , and feeddown from @xmath10 are @xmath42 ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) of the prompt @xmath0 s , respectively . according to fig .",

    "the polarization parameter @xmath25 is defined by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is the cross section for the transversely ( longitudinally ) polarized @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is completely transverse ( longitudinal ) , then @xmath66 . if @xmath0 unpolarized , then @xmath67 .",
    "the polarized cross sections depend on the frame .",
    "we choose the hadron cm frame that was employed in the phenix analysis .    the @xmath5 dependence of the polarization parameter @xmath25 integrated over the forward - rapidity region @xmath68 is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : sigma1 ] .",
    "the nrqcd prediction is slightly transverse over the whole range of @xmath5 , while the color - singlet contribution gets more transverse as @xmath5 increases . in comparison with the prediction for the midrapidity region ,",
    "the uncertainties mostly ( @xmath69 ) come from the nrqcd me and pdf .    our results for the polarization agree with the phenix preliminary data @xcite and are also compatible with the csm prediction at nlo @xcite , which has larger uncertainties than the nrqcd prediction .",
    "the s - channel - cut prediction disagrees with both nrqcd and the phenix preliminary data @xcite .",
    "in this section , we provide the nrqcd predictions for the rapidity distributions of the production rate and polarization parameter @xmath25 . the phenix analysis of the rapidity dependence of the @xmath0 is under way with a conservative cut @xmath23 which avoids the kinematic region where the fixed - order calculations may break down . because the differential cross section at @xmath70 is less than @xmath71 @xmath72 of that for @xmath73 , the total cross section should be insensitive to an upper limit @xmath74 and the neglect of the gluon fragmentation can be justified .",
    "our results show that about 79% of the total production rate comes from the direct @xmath0 , and feeddowns from @xmath10 and @xmath41 occupy 13% and 8% , respectively . in fig .",

    "the lower cut for @xmath5 severely eliminates the color - octet and color - singlet @xmath48 contributions to occupy only a few percent of the total production rate , making @xmath51 and @xmath52 octet channels dominate .",
    "the dominant source of the uncertainties in the rapidity distribution is the scale dependence which occupies about @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) at @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",

    "the @xmath5 and @xmath75 distributions are given in the kinematic ranges @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . while the nrqcd prediction for the prompt @xmath0 polarization in the midrapidity region ( @xmath20 ) is slightly longitudinal , that in the forward - rapidity region ( @xmath2 ) is slightly transverse with less theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the change in the lower-@xmath5 cut to @xmath87 also reduced the uncertainties in our prediction by avoiding a possible break down of fixed - order calculations at low @xmath5 .",
    "the lo csm prediction severely underestimates the differential cross section and shows more transverse @xmath0 than that of nrqcd .",
    "our polarization prediction is less transverse as that of the s - channel - cut method  @xcite ( @xmath88 ) , but is compatible with the nlo csm prediction  @xcite , which has larger uncertainties than our results .",
