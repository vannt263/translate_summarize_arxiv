    "recently , using 4.3 fb@xmath1 , the cdf collaboration reported a 3.3 sigma excess over standard model ( sm ) background in dijet events with an associated lepton ( electron or muon ) and missing energy  @xcite .",
    "this excess is present in the dijet invariant mass range of 120160 gev , and a gaussian fit to the background - subtracted histogram in this mass range gives a gaussian peak at @xmath2 gev .",
    "while this anomaly is interesting in its own right , a confirmation by the d0 collaboration or the persistence of this anomaly as the tevatron accumulates its final dataset would provide theorists with a robust signal of new physics ( np ) beyond the sm .",
    "the gradual accumulation of such anomalies in collider data from the tevatron and the lhc will serve as the bedrock for extending physics beyond the sm . while many of the np models in the past few decades have been constructed from top - down approach , in this instance , we can adopt a bottom - up experimentally driven construction of a np model .    from a bottom - up approach",
    ", we look for minimal extensions to the sm in terms of both new field content and new symmetries . while this approach will not in general lead to the construction of a full model , the resulting data - driven minimal model can readily be embedded as a feature of complete , top - down new physics constructions .",
    "this embedding is key to identifying future searches and cross channels that will validate or disprove the proposed full model .    in this paper , we consider possible new physics explanations for the cdf excess in dijet events with an electron or muon and missing energy . in  sec .",
    "[ sec : approach ] , we discuss our bottom - up approach to construct the simplest possible np model that can give rise to the observed excess , which we find to be a @xmath0 model with a @xmath0 mass of about 150 gev . in  sec .",
    "[ sec : bounds ] , we briefly discuss the collider constraints on @xmath0 masses and couplings and conclude that flavor - universal @xmath0 models that could explain the cdf anomaly are excluded .",
    "we therefore discard flavor - universality and consider the @xmath3 model , a @xmath0 that couples equally to and only to the first generation quarks , which we present in  sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "we conclude in  sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] with a summary and a brief discussion of possible cross - channels to check at the tevatron or the lhc .",
    "new physics parameter space is large , and many different models can be made to fit the excess . in our bottom - up approach ,",
    "we seek minimal extensions of the sm , keeping in mind both theoretical and experimental constraints on such extensions .",
    "the cdf event selection calls for events with one electron ( muon ) with @xmath4 gev and no other leptons with @xmath5 gev ; in addition , a @xmath6 mass window ( from @xmath7 gev ) cut on dilepton candidate events is imposed .",
    "the event selection also requires strictly two jets , reconstructed using a fixed - cone algorithm with @xmath8 , each with @xmath9 gev and @xmath10 : the dijet system must have @xmath11 gev .",
    "in addition , events are required to have missing transverse energy ( met ) @xmath12 gev .",
    "the transverse mass of the single hard lepton and the met is required to be compatible with a @xmath13-candidate , @xmath14 gev .",
    "additional details regarding jet energy corrections and isolation requirements are given in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "table 4.2 and section 8.1 of the cavaliere thesis ) .",
    "the event excess is present in both electrons and muons . for electrons ,",
    "the excess number of events is @xmath15 , and for muons , the excess is @xmath16 . naively summing the systematic errors in quadrature , we find the total excess is @xmath17 events .",
    "the new physics contribution thus needs to give an excess in the dijet , single hard lepton , and met final state with an effective cross section ( new physics cross section @xmath18 acceptance ) of about 60 fb for the tevatron collider .",
    "if we presume the lepton arises from a @xmath13 boson , the required effective cross section for np production including a hard @xmath13 boson is about 270 fb , and if we estimate the acceptance factor for our signal to be about 10% , then we are looking for a total signal cross section of about 2.7 pb .",
    "for comparison , the measured @xmath19 cross section is 18.1 @xmath20 3.3 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath20 2.5 ( syst . )",
    "pb , consistent with the sm prediction of 15.9 @xmath20 0.9 pb  @xcite .",
    "thus , we aim to develop a minimal new physics model that has approximately an @xmath21 production cross section , including @xmath13 emission .",
    "there are two main issues from a bottom - up perspective .",
    "first , considering the excess in the dijet invariant mass distribution from 120160 gev , we can interpret it as a colored resonance , an uncolored resonance , or a kinematic feature from a cascade decay .",
    "second , concerning the presence of the hard lepton , we can consider , in turn , scenarios that are lepton number violating , lepton number conserving but flavor violating , or lepton number and flavor conserving with the separate possibility of kinematic suppression of additional leptons . separately , the observed met could arise from sm neutrinos , or it could arise from a np source of missing energy : in the first case , we could again consider possible np scenarios of lepton flavor and/or number violation , but this is redundant and unnecessary given the hard lepton .",
    "we will first discuss the dijet invariant mass excess as a possible kinematic feature from a cascade decay chain .",
    "invariant mass distributions from cascade decay chains can appear to have broad resonance features when the underlying particle masses are tuned appropriately and the correct particle combinations are isolated  @xcite .",
    "a simple example of such a cascade decay chain is when a massive color octet decays via a on- or off - shell massive color triplet to a color singlet that subsequently escapes the detector : in supersymmetry ( susy ) , this is the familiar gluino cascade decay , @xmath23 , which can have a large rate if the @xmath24 .",
    "for example , if @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 gev , and @xmath27 gev , the exact dijet invariant mass edge would be 164 gev and the dijet invariant mass distribution would exhibit the usual triangular shape , assuming the emitted quarks are massless . since the quarks shower and hadronize , however , we expect the triangular feature to be smoothed out and the distribution to have a tail from jet - parton momenta mismatch as well as pollution by wrong dijet combinations .",
    "there are several difficulties with making such a possibility work .",
    "first , generating a lepton together with this dijet invariant mass feature requires additional ingredients .",
    "if we assume the lepton arose from the same decay chain , we can consider an illustrative susy example : @xmath28 in this susy example , we would need to have large @xmath29-parity violation in order to singly produce the @xmath30 , but we would also need to minimize @xmath29-parity violation in order to force the prescribed decay chain . if we retain @xmath29-parity and still assume the @xmath31 is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , we can assume the gluino is either produced in pairs or in association with a squark . in either case , the searches for susy in final states of one lepton , jets , and met  @xcite or opposite - sign dilepton events , jets , and met  @xcite have put strict constraints on gluinos and squarks with masses below about 500 gev ( and even up to 700 gev ) .    if we make @xmath32 the lsp , then the lepton could minimally arise from the leptonic decay of a @xmath13 boson : such a @xmath13 could be produced from a heavy squark to light squark decay or in a chargino to neutralino decay ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "an example susy process for the cdf excess in this case is @xmath33 where the @xmath34 , @xmath35 is soft , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are hard jets that give the invariant mass excess . here , in contrast with the above gluino decay in  eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gludecay ] ) , the necessary addition of a weak gauge coupling is a model - independent penalty in order to incorporate the @xmath13 in a cascade decay chain , and the @xmath38% leptonic branching ratio of the @xmath13 boson is an additional penalty .",
    "an alternative to  eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sqgludecay ] ) is if a slepton were part of the cascade process , but such decay chains typically give rise to large multilepton signals , which are disfavored from  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "moreover , cascade processes such as  eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sqgludecay ] ) can be easily checked in the jets+met cross - channel , and recent results  @xcite on these final states indicate that such spectra would need fine - tuning in order to evade constraints .",
    "other choices for the stable lsp besides a neutralino or sneutrino are ruled out or disfavored from the recent searches for long - lived massive charged particles  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , a susy decay chain explanation for the dijet excess suffers from two competing considerations . in order to have an appreciable susy colored cross section at the tevatron",
    ", we must make the gluinos and squarks relatively light .",
    "yet , the requirement to have a lepton emitted in a cascade requires a slepton , a sneutrino , or a @xmath13 insertion , making the resulting effective cross section for a 2 jets + lepton + met final state disfavored given atlas and cms searches . since there is a great deal of freedom in arranging the susy spectrum , however , we do not rule out a susy explanation for the cdf anomaly but instead leave such a construction for future work .",
    "we can also consider a non - susy decay chain explanation .",
    "the simplest would be a non - susy version of  eq .",
    "( [ eqn : gludecay ] ) , which minimally requires the introduction of a new heavy color octet @xmath39 and triplet @xmath40 , @xmath41 we note that other color representations for the initial particle are also obviously possible : the only assumption is that the @xmath13 at the end of the decay arises from a weak coupling vertex involving a sm quark and some new physics particle , which must necessarily be in the triplet representation of @xmath42 .",
    "for example , the new @xmath40 can be considered as a fourth generation quark , though no such assumption is truly motivated from the bottom - up approach .",
    "we note that although this decay chain readily produces all of the final state particles of the cdf anomaly , the decay chain arises from a resonance , and so must couple directly to quarks and/or gluons .",
    "this implies the constraints and phenomenology are similar to the dijet resonance considerations , and so we will incorporate this discussion with the next subsection .",
    "a more straightforward bottom - up construction is to hypothesize the two jets arise from a resonance , not a cascade decay chain . given the lack of @xmath43-tagging information about the jets , we note the resonance , if colored , could be one of many different color representations under @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , the emission of the hard lepton and the met requirement allows one of several possibilities : np could be lepton number violating ( lnv ) , lepton flavor violationg ( lfv ) , or lepton number and flavor conserving .",
    "because the met requirement is small , we can naturally associate the met to be a neutrino emission and confine our discussion to np scenarios that conserve lepton number and lepton flavor .",
    "we leave the possible construction of a viable lnv or lfv model for future work .",
    "therefore , we consider a new physics resonance that decays to two jets where the decay chain includes a @xmath13 boson , or the resonance is produced in association with a @xmath13 boson .",
    "the tevatron production cross section then necessarily includes weak coupling and the @xmath13 leptonic branching fraction penalty : to avoid this , we could instead consider a @xmath44 boson that decays favorably to leptons .",
    "recent constraints on a new @xmath44 boson with leptonic couplings , however , completely exclude any such @xmath44 boson with a mass below about 1.5 tev  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty with the resonance + sm @xmath13 model is that , by construction , the new resonance can always be produced in an @xmath45-channel process without an associated @xmath13 boson and hence is subject to direct searches for dijet resonances .",
    "correspondingly , the dijet resonance can not be strongly coupled ( the dijet search constraints are discussed in  sec .",
    "[ sec : bounds ] ) , but even so , we are left with many possibilities for the couplings and character of the new resonance . the resonance can be colored or uncolored , can couple exclusively to gluons , quarks , or both , and can conserve or violate quark flavor .",
    "we will not consider a resonance coupling exclusively to gluons , because we require the resonance to be produced in association with a @xmath13 boson .",
    "similarly , we will not consider a fractionally - charged resonance with a gluon-(anti-)quark coupling because the coupling would be non - diagonal if the resonance were in the same @xmath42 representation as the ( anti- ) quark , and for higher @xmath42 representations , the gluon - quark resonance would require a careful consideration of constraints to ensure it remains viable .",
    "we reserve a study of phenomenology and constraints of this interesting quark ",
    "gluon resonance model for future work .",
    "if the resonance has quark-(anti-)quark couplings , we could expect the dominant process for associated @xmath13 boson production to come from the 22 @xmath46-channel scattering process @xmath47 where the @xmath46-channel exchanged @xmath42 fundamental could also be a fourth generation quark .",
    "we see that this process is reminiscent of  eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nonsusydecay ] ) : in fact these production processes can be considered as differing cases of the same underlying new physics model that introduces a new @xmath42 octet @xmath48 and a new @xmath42 triplet @xmath40",
    ". we remark that if the @xmath46-channel exchange particle is a sm quark , then the only two free parameters are the resonance - quark - quark coupling and the width of the resonance , since the mass of the resonance is fixed from the gaussian fit to the dijet excess performed by cdf . on one hand ,",
    "these two free parameters are constrained by direct dijet searches , and on the other hand , these are the only parameters available to ensure the cross section for resonance + @xmath13 production matches the observed number of events at cdf . if the @xmath46-channel also included a fourth generation quark , however , then we have additional freedom to modify separately the direct dijet cross section and the resonance + @xmath13 production cross section .    alternatively , for the resonance with quark-(anti-)quark couplings , the dominant process for @xmath13 emission could be from @xmath45-channel production , as in @xmath49 here",
    ", we have changed the resonance notation to the traditional @xmath0 to emphasize that it is a color singlet .",
    "again , the advantage of this @xmath45-channel construction is there are separate couplings that control the cdf event excess and the direct dijet production of @xmath0 : this model freedom can clearly be used to evade constraints from direct searches while also ensuring the correct production cross section for the excess . a similar process to  eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wprime ] ) would be production of a techni - rho decaying to a techni - pion : @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath45-channel explanation is disfavored , however , from both the cdf data ( cf .",
    "fig .  9.13 of @xcite ) and the bounds on new dijet resonances ( discussed in detail in  sec .",
    "[ sec : bounds ] ) . in the cdf analysis",
    ", they do not find a resonance feature in the @xmath51 invariant mass ; instead , the total invariant mass is consistent with the background hypothesis .",
    "we note that we can avoid generating a feature in @xmath52 by postulating additional decay products that are invisible , soft , or otherwise missed by the detector .",
    "such constructions and their corresponding experimental constraints are very model dependent , however , so following our bottom - up approach , we consider @xmath46-channel production of a @xmath0 resonance + sm @xmath13 boson with only sm quarks exchanged",
    ". we will find that we can successfully fit the cdf dijet excess with such a @xmath0 model .    in summary , from a bottom - up perspective , we discussed the possibility of a dijet cascade decay invariant mass feature and a dijet resonance .",
    "we also considered the origin of the observed lepton : if the lepton comes from a @xmath13 boson , then the full cross section would require a weak coupling and pay a price in the @xmath13 leptonic branching ratio .",
    "on the other hand , if the lepton is from a cascade decay , then model - dependent tuning is needed to ensure a large branching fraction for a single lepton . given these considerations , we find the simplest new physics model for explaining the cdf anomaly is a @xmath0 dijet resonance produced in association with a @xmath13 that decays leptonically , as shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : tchannel ] .     @xmath53 associated production with a @xmath46-channel sm @xmath54 quark . ]",
    "from our bottom - up approach , the simplest model to explain the cdf anomaly is a @xmath0 dijet resonance produced in association with a leptonically decaying @xmath13 boson .",
    "constraints on such a light @xmath0 , however , are very stringent .    for instance , a @xmath0 boson with sm @xmath6 couplings to leptons is ruled out below a mass of 1071 gev  @xcite . from a bottom - up",
    "approach , however , we do not require the @xmath0 to couple to leptons , and hence we can postulate that the @xmath0 is leptophobic , _",
    "i.e. _ only couples to quarks .",
    "even so , searches for dijet resonances place strong constraints on this type of @xmath0 boson .",
    "the most recent results from atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite , however , look for dijet invariant masses above @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 gev , respectively , in order to avoid , presumably , the qcd background contamination in the low dijet mass region .",
    "these hard cuts will clearly discard our light @xmath0 events .",
    "similarly , cdf and d0 searches applicable to leptophobic @xmath0 bosons have dijet mass thresholds of at least 180 gev  @xcite or look for @xmath57 resonances  @xcite .",
    "all of these constraints apply to @xmath0 masses outside our range of interest , given the gaussian fit of cdf s dijet excess has a mean 144 gev .",
    "we find the relevant experimental constraint on dijet resonances in this mass range comes from the ua2 collaboration  @xcite . in this analysis",
    ", they assumed a @xmath0 with exactly sm couplings and a width that scaled with the mass ratio of the @xmath0 to the @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the cross section was also corrected with a k - factor of about 1.30  @xcite , based on the k - factor calculated for sm drell - yan @xmath6 production .",
    "their results concluded that a sm - like @xmath0 is excluded at 150 gev .",
    "although our naive leptophobic @xmath0 model with sm @xmath6 couplings to quarks is ruled out from ua2 data , we can choose to abandon flavor universality .",
    "in this case , we expect the ua2 bound implies our @xmath0 coupling needs to be about @xmath58 weaker than the sm @xmath6 coupling to quarks .",
    "if we retain flavor universality , we can satisfy the ua2 constraint and produce the desired cdf excess with a @xmath59 , but we would also need to consider constraints from higgs searches in the @xmath60 final state  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore consider a @xmath0 that only couples to up and down quarks with equal couplings , avoiding flavor constraints .",
    "this is our minimal model motivated from a bottom - up approach to the cdf dijet , lepton , and met events excess . taking into account the @xmath0 mass will be fixed by the cdf dijet gaussian fit , this model has two free parameters : @xmath61 and the @xmath3 width .",
    "faced with the severe constraint from ua2 on light @xmath0 bosons in the 150 gev mass range , we construct the @xmath3 model with the lagrangian @xmath62 where @xmath3 is a new @xmath63 gauge boson , and @xmath61 is the new coupling , same for both up and down quarks .",
    "the @xmath3 is a singlet under the standard model gauge group and we turn off its mixing with the sm @xmath6 boson .",
    "( for a recent review on @xmath0 models and phenomenology , see  @xcite by p.  langacker . )    for our purposes , we can consider the @xmath3 as a particular leptophobic @xmath0 model based on gauging the sm baryon number symmetry .",

    "may be lost in the qcd background at tevatron and the lhc , but a signal may be recoverable if the backgrounds are very well understood . separately , because the lepton here arises from associated @xmath13 production , a smaller penalty in cross section would be achieved by looking for a photon + dijet signal  . at the lhc , since exclusive dijet searches are expected to be difficult because of the qcd background , one possible search channel is in the exclusive four jets final state . using madevent 4.4.56 , we estimate the lo cross section for di-@xmath3 production at the 7 tev lhc with @xmath81 and a width of 12 gev is 1.51 pb , which could be testable with an integrated luminosity of @xmath82 .",
