    "in order to understand formation and evolution of galaxies , systematic searches for galaxies in the early universe and detailed studies of the detected galaxies are necessary . in this decade , a number of galaxies detected at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) has been rapidly increasing .",
    "the use of photometric redshift selection from deep broad - band images , especially so - called `` lyman break method '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ) gives the largest sample of galaxies at @xmath7 ( lyman break galaxies ; lbgs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extensive studies of them have been revealing individual and statistical nature of star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ; papovich , dickinson , & ferguson 2001 ) .    at the same time , their optical follow - up spectroscopy has also been made extensively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and revealed rest - frame uv spectral features of lbgs in addition to their redshift information . using about 800 spectra of lbgs at @xmath7 , @xcite found that about three fourth of them show significant ly@xmath3 emission line and the remainders show only ly@xmath3 absorption .",
    "the lbgs with weaker ly@xmath3 emission have stronger low - ionization interstellar metal absorption lines and redder uv continua .",
    "these trend suggest that the lbgs at @xmath7 with weak ly@xmath3 emission are more metal enriched and dusty , i.e. , chemically evolved than those with strong ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "how about properties of lbgs at higher redshift ?",
    "are there any signs of evolution of lbgs compared with lbgs at @xmath7 ? to answer the question and obtain clues to understand formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe , we made a systematic search for lbgs at @xmath0 ( @xmath101gyr earlier to @xmath11 ) .",
    "we carried out wide ( effectively @xmath12 arcmin@xmath13 ) and deep broad - band ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) imaging observations toward an area centered on the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with suprime - cam @xcite attached to the subaru telescope .",
    "thanks to plenty of redshift information of galaxies in and around the hdf - n , we could set suitable color criteria on the two - color ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) diagram to effectively select galaxies at @xmath18 avoiding foreground contamination , and obtained @xmath19 lbg candidates at @xmath0 with @xmath20 mag @xmath21 mag @xcite .",
    "this is one of the largest lbg samples at @xmath0 systematically surveyed . using this sample",
    ", we statistically derived a rest - frame uv luminosity function ( uvlf ) of lbgs at @xmath0 , which shows only a slight change from @xmath0 to @xmath7 .",
    "we also found that a spatial distribution of lbgs at @xmath0 shows a large void - like structure and a larger clustering amplitude than that at @xmath7 ( in preparation ) .",
    "the presence of a similar void - like structure is seen in @xcite , and a large clustering amplitude of lbgs at @xmath0 may also suggest the presence of the larger bias in galaxy formation at @xmath0 than at @xmath7 @xcite .    in order to confirm redshifts of the lbg candidates and to study spectral features and relations with other properties of them , we started follow - up optical spectroscopy of our lbg candidates at @xmath0 .",
    "although similar systematic searches for @xmath22 galaxies have been carried out ( e.g. , @xcite ; yan , windhorst , & cohen 2003 ; stanway , bunker , & mcmahon 2003 ) , a number of spectra of lbgs at @xmath0 is still extremely small .",
    "moreover most of the spectra obtained so far show only ly@xmath3 emission , and the continuum spectral feature and relations with other properties observed in lbgs at @xmath7 are still quite unknown . in this paper , we present initial results of the optical spectroscopy of a part of our sample .",
    "observations and data reduction are described in section 2 , and the results are presented in section 3 . in section 4 , we compare the results with spectral features obtained for lbgs at @xmath7 , and discuss possible origins of the similarity and difference seen in spectral features .",
    "the magnitude system is based on ab magnitude unless otherwise noted .",
    "we made optical spectroscopy for a subset of our sample using multi - object - spectroscopy ( mos ) mode of the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) attached to the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "main spectroscopic targets are our lbg candidates brighter than @xmath23 mag .",
    "since a mask plate of focas mos covers a 6@xmath24 aperture diameter field of view , we designed mos masks to contain as many main targets as possible on each mos field .",
    "the number of targets thus selected is 17 .",
    "in addition to them , we selected 7 objects with @xmath25 mag which lie out of the color selection window but near the border line of the window in order to examine our color selection criteria .",
    "we also included fainter lbg candidates ( @xmath26 mag ) as many as possible in each mask .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made on 2003 february 24 - 26 under clear sky conditions .",
    "we used the grism of 300 lines / mm blazed at 7500  and the so58 order cut filter .",
    "the wavelength coverage was from 5800  to 10000   ( depending on a slit position on a mask ) with a pixel scale of 1.34 .",
    "the slit lengths were typically 10@xmath27 , and the slit widths were fixed to be 0.@xmath278 , giving a spectral resolution of r@xmath10500 .",
    "one ccd pixel covered 0.@xmath281 and a spatial sampling was 0.@xmath273 pixel@xmath29 by on - chip three pixel binning .",
    "an exposure time of each frame was 0.5 hours , and a total exposure time was 5.5 hours for two masks ( mask name f01 and f02 ) , and 5.0 hours for one mask ( mask name f08 ) .",
    "we nodded the telescope with @xmath101@xmath28 along the slit length for each exposure .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars feige 34 and feige 66 were observed with long - slit mode ( a slit width of 2@xmath28 ) for sensitivity correction .",
    "seeing during the observing runs was 0.@xmath308 .",
    "the data were reduced with standard procedure using iraf .",
    "bias was subtracted by using the overscan region and bias frames , and flat - fielding was made by normalizing averaged dome flat images .",
    "the spectra for each target were then carefully aligned and combined for each night .",
    "wavelength calibration was made using night sky emission lines exposed in the object frame with rms errors of @xmath31  .",
    "sky emission was subtracted by using background task of iraf .",
    "five pixels were binned for a wavelength direction to improve s / n .",
    "one - dimensional spectrum of each object was extracted by using apall task of iraf . since our targets are faint , an aperture for the extraction was determined for each object by eyes to trace the object well .",
    "after sensitivity correction ( including correction for atmospheric a and b bands by tracing the absorption features in the spectra of the standard stars ) was applied to combined spectra for each night , we obtained final spectra by combining them .",
    "figure 1 shows spectra of eight objects identified to be at @xmath0 .",
    "object no.3 ( f01 - 03 ) has already been identified with an agn at @xmath32 by @xcite in a follow - up spectroscopy of 1ms _ chandra _ observation at the hdf - n .",
    "a significant continuum break at the redshifted ly@xmath3 is seen in all the spectra .",
    "the average of the depression factor @xmath33 @xcite for these objects is @xmath34 which is very close to those for qsos at @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the estimation by @xcite .",
    "the spectra of seven lbgs ( excluding object no.3 ) also show low ionization interstellar ( lis ) metal absorption lines such as @xmath51260 , + @xmath51303 , and @xmath51334 which are prominent features in uv spectra of nearby starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in spectra of lbgs at @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus they are securely identified to be at @xmath0 .",
    "we determined their redshifts as an average of these two or three lis absorption lines and listed the results in table 1 as well as their coordinates and photometric data .",
    "the obtained redshift range from 4.5 to 5.2 is consistent with that expected from the color selection , figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "we also constructed a composite rest - frame spectrum of the seven lbgs by scaling the continuum level of each spectrum and show the result in figure 2 , together with the composite spectrum of 811 lbgs at @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "four objects show no significant ly@xmath3 emission line , and the other three objects , no.1 , no.6 , and no.7 show a ly@xmath3 emission line , but their rest - frame equivalent widths are rather weak ; ew@xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively , with an error of 2030% .",
    "the average rest - frame equivalent width of ly@xmath3 of the seven lbgs is 2.5  , and that derived from the composite spectrum is 4.5 line , which seem to result in the slightly larger ly@xmath3 equivalent width for the composite spectrum . ] .",
    "the position of ly@xmath3 for some of them locates in the wavelength region of the atmospheric b band absorption .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the correction for the absorption is at most @xmath38% .    a mean rest - frame equivalent width of three lis absorption lines ( @xmath51260 , + @xmath51303 , and @xmath51334 ) for each of the seven lbgs is measured to be @xmath39  and",
    "is listed in table 1 .",
    "the average rest - frame equivalent widths of @xmath51260 , + @xmath51303 , and @xmath51334 of the seven lbgs are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively , which agree with those measured in the composite spectrum ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath42 , respectively% . ] . some of the lbgs show a high ionization absorption feature of @xmath451393 , 1402 which are also detected in local starburst galaxies and lbgs at @xmath7 .",
    "most of them lie in the wavelength region where the sky emission is strong or an atmospheric absorption is severe , and we did not measure an equivalent width for each object .",
    "the @xmath461393 , 1402 feature can be seen in the composite spectrum , thanks to the improvement of the s / n .",
    "peaks of the ly@xmath3 emission lines are redshifted with respect to the lis lines by @xmath47 km s@xmath29 , @xmath48 km s@xmath29 , and @xmath49 km s@xmath29 , for no.1 , no.6 , and no.7 , respectively . in the composite spectrum , the offset is @xmath50 km s@xmath29 .",
    "the value is almost the same as that of the lbgs at @xmath7 with weak or no ly@xmath3 emission lines ( 630 km s@xmath29 for group 2 by @xcite ) and also fits a relation between the outflow velocity and the equivalent widths of lis for lbgs at @xmath51 by frye , broadhurst , & benitez ( 2002 ) .",
    "we also measured a continuum slope @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) of the composite spectrum to be @xmath54 with a fitting uncertainty of @xmath55 .",
    "however , since the value is determined in a short wavelength coverage ( @xmath10250 ) and depends on an applied binning scale and a clipping threshold in making the composite spectrum , the uncertainty of @xmath52 would be much larger .",
    "thus we do not discuss the result further .    among the remainders of the spectroscopic sample in the color selection window with @xmath25 mag ,",
    "two objects show hints of the presence of a continuum break at the wavelength corresponding to a redshifted ly@xmath3 at @xmath0 and of one or two lis absorption lines which could be identified to be at @xmath0 . however , the s / ns of their spectra are poor and we do not discuss these objects in this paper . for the remaining targets",
    ", we could not find any significant features due to the poor s /",
    "n . a roughly estimated upper limit on the rest - frame ly@xmath3 equivalent width for these objects is @xmath56  .",
    "for the targets with @xmath57 mag , we could not find any significant features due to the poor s /",
    "n . the s / n of the spectrum depends not only on the @xmath58 magnitude , but also on its surface brightness .",
    "the objects identified to be at @xmath0 tend to have the sizes ( fwhm ) comparable to the seeing size and thus have the brighter peaks than those of the other objects having larger sizes .",
    "figure 3 shows the positions of the objects identified to be at @xmath0 ( filled circles ) in the two color diagram ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) as well as the unidentified objects with @xmath61 mag ( open triangles ) .",
    "one of the seven lbgs shown in figure 1 is undetected in @xmath62 band ( @xmath63 mag ) , while the remaining six are detected in @xmath62 band within an aperture of @xmath64 .",
    "four among seven targets ( @xmath61 mag ) outside of the selection window are identified to be galactic m stars ( filled pentagons ) .",
    "these results suggest that our selection criteria for objects at @xmath0 is reasonable .",
    "@xcite divided spectroscopically confirmed @xmath10800 lbgs at @xmath7 into four subgroups ( each group consists of @xmath10200 lbgs ) based on rest - frame ly@xmath3 equivalent width , and made composite spectra for each group .",
    "they found that about three fourth of the @xmath10 800 lbgs at @xmath7 show ly@xmath3 emission lines , and about two third of them show strong ly@xmath3 emission ( ew@xmath65 ) .",
    "line by summing up both emission and absorption . in our case , we measured the equivalent width of ly@xmath3 only for the emission part mainly because it is hard to distinguish intrinsic absorption and intergalactic absorption .",
    "thus the value of rest - frame equivalent width of ly@xmath3 by @xcite is the lower limit when it is compared with our equivalent width .",
    "] they also found that lbgs with weaker ly@xmath3 emission have stronger lis absorption lines , redder uv continuum slopes , and larger @xmath66 values .",
    "the weak ly@xmath3 emission , strong lis absorption lines , the red uv color , and the large @xmath66 are considered to originate in dusty environment . in the lbgs with no or weak ly@xmath3 emission",
    ", star formation may occur earlier and may be chemically more evolved than those with strong ly@xmath3 emission . although shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) pointed out a possibility that the lbgs with weak ly@xmath3 emission are younger than those with strong emission from the sed fitting , this might be reconciled with the chemically evolved nature if the ages derived by sed fitting are affected by the most recent star formation occurred in the lbgs .",
    "the spectra of our seven lbgs ( expect for one agn ) at @xmath0 and thus the composite spectrum of them is significantly different from the composite spectrum of lbgs at @xmath7 as shown in figure 2 . the ly@xmath3 emission is much weaker , and the continuum depression in the wavelength region shorter than the redshifted ly@xmath3 emission is much larger than those at @xmath7 .",
    "the measured equivalent width of ly@xmath3 emission is @xmath67  at @xmath0 while @xmath68  at @xmath7 .",
    "the lis absorption lines are stronger in the spectrum for @xmath0 than in that for @xmath7 ; measured equivalent widths of @xmath51260 , + @xmath51303 , and @xmath51334 are @xmath43 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively for @xmath0 , while @xmath69 , @xmath41 , and @xmath70 , respectively for @xmath7 . however , the spectra of the seven lbgs at @xmath0 fairly resemble to subpopulations of lbgs at @xmath7 ; the composite spectra of lbgs at @xmath7 with no or weak ly@xmath3 emission ( group 1 and group 2 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are quite similar to the spectra of our lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "the average rest - frame equivalent widths of the three lis absorption lines of the seven lbgs at @xmath0 is @xmath43 being very close to @xmath71  for group 1 ( no ly@xmath3 emission ) .",
    "the average value of ew@xmath72(lis ) corresponds to metallicity of 12@xmath73log(o / h)@xmath74 , if we assume that the relation obtained in the local universe by @xcite can be applied to the high redshift lbgs , which is not certain at this moment .",
    "these results suggest that these lbgs at @xmath0 are chemically evolved to some degree .",
    "all our lbgs confirmed to be at @xmath0 show no or weak ly@xmath3 emission with relatively strong lis absorption lines ; a fraction of lbgs with strong ly@xmath3 emission is very small , though the sample size is still small .",
    "we may be witnessing some sign of evolution of lbgs from @xmath0 to @xmath7 .",
    "the lack of strong ly@xmath3 emission as well as the presence of strong lis absorption at @xmath0 are likely to be due to their dusty and chemically evolved environment ( though the escape of ly@xmath3 photons may not be related in a simple way to the metallicity of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) and to the presence of more neutral hydrogen in and/or around a galaxy than that at @xmath7",
    ".    however , it is worth emphasizing that the lbgs we observed are relatively brighter ones among those at @xmath0 ( @xmath75 mag corresponds to @xmath76 of uvlf at @xmath0 @xcite . ) .",
    "there is a possibility that the strength of ly@xmath3 emission depends on the magnitude ( i.e. , uv continuum ) .",
    "@xcite found for lbgs at @xmath7 that the average uv magnitude is fainter for the lbgs with stronger ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "they also found that the average rest - frame equivalent width of the ly@xmath3 emission line of faint lbgs is larger than that of bright lbgs among the subgroup with strong ly@xmath3 emission of ew@xmath77 20 .",
    "this trend could also be the case at @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , @xcite , who made a similar search for lbgs at @xmath0 using @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 band deep images , found that all of their spectroscopically confirmed six objects to be at @xmath0 show very strong ( ew@xmath81 ) ly@xmath3 emission lines .",
    "the @xmath79 magnitudes of them are @xmath82 magnitude fainter than those of our seven lbgs at @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the number density of ly@xmath3 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath83 against to lbgs at @xmath0 rapidly decreases with increasing uv continuum light ( @xmath84 mag ) .",
    "these observational results suggest that the brighter lbgs tend to show the weaker ly@xmath3 emission also at @xmath0 .",
    "it is also worth noting here that the lbgs with secure redshifts tend to show rather compact morphology .",
    "thus the weakness of ly@xmath3 emission and the strong lis absorption lines may also relate to their morphological property , which may also link to an evolutionary stage of galaxies .    if we interpret that the weakness of the ly@xmath3 emission is caused by the dusty environment in the lbgs , it might be possible that the brightest lbgs are the most chemically evolved ones at the epoch .",
    "it is known that brighter lbgs have a larger correlation length at @xmath7 @xcite , suggesting that they are associated with more massive dark halos and star formation may occur with biased manner in the earlier epoch as compared with less clustered fainter lbgs .",
    "the similar result has been obtained for lbgs at @xmath85 by @xcite .",
    "we also found the same clustering segregation with magnitude in our sample of lbgs at @xmath0 ( in preparation ) .",
    "thus the brighter lbgs at @xmath0 may be associated with even more massive dark halos and have experienced more biased star formation , resulting in more dusty environment as compared with many of lbgs at @xmath7 with a strong ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "another possible reason of the difference of ly@xmath3 appearance is the effect of a strong clustering of laes . @xcite and @xcite found that there is an overdensity region ( @xmath86 ) of laes ( ew@xmath87 ) at @xmath88 from their wide - field deep narrow - band observations .",
    "the observed field ( 44 arcmin@xmath13 ) of @xcite may happen to fall on an overdensity region of ly @xmath3 emitters ; their rest - frame equivalent widths of ly@xmath3 emission ( @xmath89 ) is larger than the detection threshold of the lae selection . while our field of view for the spectroscopy ( total of @xmath1085 arcmin@xmath13 ) may happen to point to a low density region of laes and we could not observe lbgs with strong ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "however , since we selected spectroscopic targets from regions where the surface density of lbg candidates is relatively high , this may be unlikely provided that the distribution of lbgs broadly coincides with that of laes at the same epoch .    to summarize",
    ", the results presented here may show some sign of evolution in spectroscopic feature from @xmath0 to @xmath90 , or the presence of luminosity dependence of nature .",
    "however , our sample size is too small to reach any significant conclusions .",
    "further spectroscopic observations of lbgs at @xmath0 over wider field and magnitude range are necessary to reveal spectroscopic nature and discuss relationship with evolution of lbg population .",

    "<S> we report initial results for spectroscopic observations of candidates of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath0 in a region centered on the hubble deep field - north by using the faint object camera and spectrograph attached to the subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> eight objects with @xmath1 mag , including one agn , are confirmed to be at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the rest - frame uv spectra of seven lbgs commonly show no or weak ly@xmath3 emission line ( rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath4 ) and relatively strong low - ionization interstellar metal absorption lines of @xmath51260 , + @xmath51303 , and @xmath51334 ( mean rest - frame equivalent widths of them are @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are significantly different from those of the mean rest - frame uv spectrum of lbgs at @xmath7 , but are quite similar to those of subgroups of lbgs at @xmath7 with no or weak ly@xmath3 emission . </S>",
    "<S> the weakness of ly@xmath3 emission and strong low - ionization interstellar metal absorption lines may indicate that these lbgs at @xmath0 are chemically evolved to some degree and have a dusty environment . </S>",
    "<S> since the fraction of such lbgs at @xmath0 in our sample is larger than that at @xmath7 , we may witness some sign of evolution of lbgs from @xmath0 to @xmath7 , though the present sample size is very small . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible , however , that the brighter lbgs tend to show no or weak ly@xmath3 emission , because our spectroscopic sample is bright ( brighter than @xmath8 ) among lbgs at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> more observations are required to establish spectroscopic nature of lbgs at @xmath0 . </S>"
