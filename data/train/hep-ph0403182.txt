    "the existence of t - odd fragmentation functions is considered to be established  @xcite . in the meantime ,",

    "t - odd parton distributions arise due to the exchange of longitudinally polarized gluons between the struck quark and the target system .",
    "this rescattering effect is encoded in the gauge link appearing in the definition of parton distributions . an alternative picture according to which",
    "t - odd parton distributions can be generated without rescattering of the struck quark  @xcite seems to be ruled out  @xcite .    in particular , due to the recent developments  @xcite , the t - odd and transverse momentum dependent ( @xmath2-dependent ) functions @xmath3 ( sivers function , describing the distribution of unpolarized quarks in a transversely polarized target )  @xcite and @xmath4 ( distribution of transversely polarized quarks in an unpolarized target )  @xcite may well exist . from a practical point of view both distributions can be considered as twist-2 functions , since they appear in observables at leading order of a @xmath5-expansion , where @xmath6 denotes the large scale of the hard process .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 enters the leading twist ssa @xmath7 in sidis  @xcite .    despite of the recent progress in understanding the nature of t - odd effects , a complete formalism ( including subleading t - odd parton distributions ) of t - odd twist-3 observables is still missing even at tree - level .",
    "so far , such effects have only been treated on the fragmentation side  @xcite .",
    "this point may also be quite important for the description of the twist-3 asymmetries @xmath0 and @xmath1 in sidis . with the exception of refs .",
    "@xcite , all present analyses / calculations of these observables are based on  @xcite , i.e. , they include only t - odd fragmentation functions ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this scenario one finds schematically @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with the twist-3 t - even parton distributions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the twist-2 t - odd collins fragmentation function @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the target is polarized along the direction of its momentum ( and the direction of the virtual photon ) . in experiments for the longitudinal target asymmetry , however , the polarization is along the direction of the incoming lepton .",

    "the coupling of the virtual photon to the diquark has to be included .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath0 turn out to be nonzero indicating that , in a factorized picture , t - odd distributions have to be taken into account .",
    "a first step in this direction has been made in  @xcite , where it has been demonstrated that the t - odd distribution @xmath4 appears in the description of @xmath1 through a term @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a twist-3 fragmentation function . as will be discussed below , our calculation of @xmath1 ,",
    "however , can not be identified with such a term suggesting that the formula of  @xcite for the beam ssa is not yet complete .",
