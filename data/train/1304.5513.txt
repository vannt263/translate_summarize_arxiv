    "porous structures are used as separators or membranes for battery and ultracapacitor applications @xcite .",
    "the separator is one of the critical components in these novel energy storage units .",
    "it prevents contacting of the positive and the negative electrodes while providing pathways for ionic charge transport through the ionically conductive electrolyte solution without electonic conduction .",
    "the separator material should be chemically reistant to the electrolyte solvents and the reducing and oxidizing environments during cell charging and discharging .",
    "it should have mechanical integrity to withstand the high tension during the assembly of the energy storage units .",
    "battery performance can be improved by finding the optimum balance between low fiber volume fraction ( facilitates ionic transport ) yet a high enough fiber volume fraction to assure sufficient mechanical integrity .",
    "the separators are classified by @xcite ( i ) microporous polymer membranes , ( ii ) non - woven fabric mats and ( iii ) inorganic composite membranes .",
    "each class has its advantages .",
    "for example as listed by @xcite the microporous polymer membranes are thin and have thermal shutdown capability ; the non - woven mats are porous and economical compared to others ; finally the composite membranes wet easily with electrolyte and operate at high temperatures .",
    "low temperature capable and inorganic separators find applications with better safety in li - ion batteries .",
    "low temperature polymers as polyethylene ( pe ) and polypropylene ( pp ) structures and pe and pp blends operate as a fuse by allowing meltdown of the low - temperature - melting - point pe that shuts down the charge conduction backbone  where the internal structure is altered with closed cells and the new porosity destroys percolating paths for the charge carriers  without causing overheating and thermal runway .",
    "the ceramic composite separators on the other hand provide high stability and keep dimensional tolerances at high temperatures providing their function  to separate the electrodes in high temperature operation . @xcite",
    "have published an excellent review on the materials and properties of separators .",
    "the current study concentrates on the modeling of polymeric separators .",
    "it investigates mechanical and electrical properties through effective medium theories with implementing combination of numerical routines .",
    "since the fiber spinning is a random process , the numerical simulations need to be adopted to fully capture the randomness in structures . for this purpose",
    ", pre- and post - processing tools were developed to be used with a commercial finite element software @xcite .",
    "our aim is to determine material manufacturing space for best performance .",
    "material structures simulated in the investigations were produced by electrospinning method @xcite .",

    "all the fibers lay on a lateral direction on a substrate  no fibers are perpendicular to the substrate orientation .    [",
    "[ ht ]      some of the factors effecting the structure of the fibrous membrane ( separator ) can be listed@xcite as follows ; ( 1 ) electrospinning needle thickness and its thickness uniformity ; ( 2 ) moisture level in the chamber ; ( 3 ) spinneret size ; ( 4 ) solution concentration ; ( 5 ) solution feeding rate , pressure at the nozzle ; ( 6 ) applied electric field at the nozzle ; ( 7 ) temperature ; ( 8) post - treatment with temperature and pressure .",
    "one can optimize the fibrous material structure with adjusting these parameters .",
    "post - treatment methods of non - woven mats are also possible to improve / change structure and porosity .",
    "designing experiments and analyzing the fabricated structures are time consuming efforts based on edisonian - approach .",
    "one solution could be to perform numerical simulations with structures close to reality , that can be used to screen structures and establish critical parameters for manufacturing .",
    "here we are attempting to do this with the monte carlo based finite element method .",
    "due to increase in need for funtional materials for mechanical , thermal and electrical applications , fibrous structures have become important because of desired properties at low percolation thresholds  one can design anisotropic materials with little addition of fibrous components .",
    "building models on these systems is an area that needs special attention .",
    "it is well know that the internal structure of a composite influences the effective properties of the composite @xcite .",
    "however , one needs to perform numerous calculations to determine properties of random structures and understand the influence of various parameters on the properties .",
    "it is therefore of importance to perform the monte carlo based studies .    in the current study",
    "a softcore approach was adapted as discussed by @xcite .",
    "similar to their approach infinite lines were generated .",
    "later the lines were converted to a three dimensional cylinder using a moving spherical representational volume .",
    "the line was used as the center of the sphere .",
    "the volume was included to a large matrix of the modeling domain ( cube ) which was considered to be @xmath0 . since we were interested in the effective properties the actual physical dimensions of the cube",
    "is irrelevant .",
    "such studies would be important when the physical laws would be different at different scales and high frequency effects due to scattering of acoustic ( pressure ) and electromagnetic waves are of important .",
    "the lines were generated using the definitions in fig .",

    "the direction of the line was determined from a random angle distribution where @xmath1 and @xmath2 were adjusted for each line .",

    "it is striking that the data obtained from the in - house routines can be expressed with archie s law with exponent @xmath44 .",
    "this can be explained with using bruggman s approach as well such that electrolyte is a continuous phase and starts to percolate even at very high concenration of fibers , notice that in our assumptions we have used low angles of @xmath1 in generating structures due to the orientation of fibers spinned in the experiments .",
    "there would not be a metal - insulator transition due to the connectivity of electrolyte at some fiber concentration .",
