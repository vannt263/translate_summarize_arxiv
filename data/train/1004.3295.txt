    "cosmological data from a wide range of sources including type ia supernovae @xcite , the cosmic microwave background @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , cluster gas fractions @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite seem to indicate that at least 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of an exotic , negative - pressure component , called dark energy .",

    "a parameter of considerable importance is the equation of state ( eos ) of the dark energy component , defined as the ratio of its pressure to its density : w = p_de/_de . if the dark energy is due to a cosmological constant , then @xmath6 is constant and exactly equal to @xmath7 .",
    "a value of @xmath8 is consistent with current observations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a variety of models have been proposed in which @xmath6 is time varying .",
    "perhaps the simplest model for time - varying @xmath6 is to take the dark energy to be due to a scalar field , dubbed  quintessence \" @xcite . as the data continue to improve",
    ", it is important to be able to distinguish models ( such as quintessence ) with a true time - varying @xmath6 from @xmath0cdm models which can effectively mimic such a time variation .    to motivate our investigation ,",
    "consider first the simple @xmath0cdm model , with present - day dark matter and cosmological constant densities of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "( zero subscripts will be used throughout to denote present - day values of cosmological quantities ) .",
    "if one does not know _ a priori _ the value of @xmath9 or the fact that the dark energy is a pure cosmological constant , then part of the dark matter density can be absorbed into the dark energy , producing ( erroneously ) a time - varying dark energy .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0cdm model with @xmath9 , @xmath10 is degenerate with the quintessence model having a present - day dark matter density @xmath11 , and a time - varying dark energy component with density @xmath12 and equation of state @xmath13 ( since our paper deals with spurious measurements of a time - varying equation of state , we will use tildes throughout to deal with spurious / unphysical / mismeasured quantities ; non - tilded variables will refer to true physical quantities ) .",
    "this degeneracy has been exhaustively explored in refs .",
    "@xcite , who pointed out that it can not be resolved without independent knowledge of the dark matter density .    on the other hand , if observational data led to an equation of state for the dark energy that mimicked the evolution of @xmath14 given in eq .",
    "( [ wdm ] ) , occam s razor would suggest that the correct model for the universe was actually @xmath0cdm , with the appropriately different value for the dark matter density .",
    "it is of interest to determine if there are any less obvious spurious time - varying equations of state for the dark energy that arise from simple variations on @xmath0cdm .",
    "one such model is @xmath0cdm with decaying dark matter .",
    "if the dark matter decays into inert radiation , and one interprets the measured behavior of @xmath15 under the incorrect assumption that the dark matter is stable , then the best fit to the observations will be a quintessence model with a time - varying equation of state .",
    "this occurs because the nonstandard time - variation in both the dark matter and inert radiation densities gets absorbed into time variation of the dark energy .",
    "this was first noted by ziaeepour @xcite , who argued that it leads , in general , to a mismeasured value of the equation of state parameter satisfying @xmath4 .",
    "( note that similar @xmath4 behavior occurs when energy can be exchanged between dark matter and dark energy @xcite , but this is a different class of models than those discussed here ) .",
    "in this paper we reexamine the behavior of such models , and provide an improved calculation of @xmath16 .",
    "we show that the behavior of @xmath16 is very sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath17 .",
    "different choices for @xmath17 can lead to models that mimic quintessence , phantom - like models , or models that cross the phantom divide . in the next section , we present the calculation of @xmath16 , and we discuss our results in sec . iii .",

    "invisible \" , we mean that the relativistic decay products are assumed to interact very weakly with ordinary matter .",
    "if the decay products did interact , e.g. , electromagnetically , they would be easily detectable at the lifetimes of interest here , and the model would already be ruled out .    the equations for the evolution of matter and the decay - produced radiation are the following : [ rhom_eom ] _",

    "we ignore `` ordinary '' radiation , since it has a negligible effect on the expansion rate in the redshift regime relevant to this problem .",
    "the existence of such decays with lifetimes comparable to the hubble time can be constrained by their effects on the cmb , large - scale structure , and sn ia observations @xcite .",
    "we will confine our attention to lifetimes satisfying the constraint given in ref .",

    ", once the equation of state of the dark energy is allowed to be a free function of @xmath42 , just as in the case of non - decaying dark matter discussed earlier @xcite , and the best one can do is to derive the behavior of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath43 . of course , there are other cosmological measurements that constrain the dark matter density .",
    "for instance , large - scale structure provides a constraint on the present - day dark matter density , while the cmb constrains the dark matter density at high redshift , but taken together these limits are consistent with a change in the comoving dark matter density as large as 15% , as noted previously @xcite .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that an observer erroneously postulating stable dark matter would derive a value for @xmath43 that lies somewhere between the values obtained by taking @xmath44 at high redshift ( @xmath45 ) or by taking @xmath44 at the present day ( @xmath46 ) . equating @xmath19 from eq .",

    "the value of @xmath15 is the same in the @xmath0cdm model with decaying dark matter and in the corresponding spurious quintessence model with stable dark matter .",

    "@xmath52 the growth rate will be larger for the spurious quintessence model than for the decaying dark matter model over the entire evolution history , while the reverse is true for @xmath51 .",
    "independent of @xmath65 , the ratio of the perturbation growth rate at late times to the growth rate at early times is smaller for the decaying dark matter model than for the corresponding spurious quintessence model with the same @xmath15 .",
    "this result follows from the fact that the dark matter density decreases more rapidly with scale factor in the former model .",
    "an obvious question is whether or not these results can ever be relevant . if dark matter really were unstable , with a lifetime much longer than the age of the universe , then it is certainly plausible that a cosmological signature of unstable dark matter would be detected first in some combination of cmb and large - scale structure observations . in this case",
    ", the information on decaying dark matter would simply be incorporated into calculations for the equation of state of the dark energy , rendering our calculations moot . on the other hand ,",
