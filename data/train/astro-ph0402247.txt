    "as reported by @xcite , an image of the moon in soft x - rays ( 0.12 kev ) was obtained by the _ rntgen satellite _ ( _ rosat _ ) using its position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on 1990 june 29 .",
    "this striking image showed an x - ray - bright sunlit half - circle on one side , and a much dimmer but not completely dark side outlined by a brighter surrounding diffuse x - ray background .",
    "several origins for the dark - side emission were considered , but the authors favored explanation was continuum emission arising from solar wind electrons sweeping around to the unlit side and impacting on the lunar surface , producing thick - target bremsstrahlung .",
    "given the very limited energy resolution of the pspc , however , emission from multiple lines could not be ruled out .    a significant problem with the bremsstrahlung model was explaining how electrons from the general direction of the sun could produce events on the opposite side of the moon , with a spatial distribution which was `` consistent with the telescope - vignetted signal of a constant extended source . ''",
    "an elegant alternative explanation would be a source of x - ray emission _ between _ the earth and the moon , but at the time , no such source could be envisioned .",
    "if this source were also time - variable , it would account for the long term enhancements ( ltes ) seen by _",
    "these occasional increases in the counting rate of the pspc are vignetted in the same way as sky - background x - rays , indicating an external origin @xcite .",
    "ltes are distinct from the particle - induced background , and are uncorrelated with the spacecraft s orientation or position ( geomagnetic latitude , etc . ) , although @xcite noted that ltes appeared to be related , by a then unknown mechanism , to geomagnetic storms and solar wind variations . the final _ rosat",
    "_  all - sky survey ( rass ) diffuse background maps @xcite removed the ltes , so far as possible , by comparing multiple observations of the same part of the sky , but any constant or slowly varying ( @xmath5 week ) emission arising from whatever was causing the ltes would remain .",
    "a conceptual breakthrough came with the _ rosat _  observation of comet hyakutake @xcite and the suggestion by @xcite that charge transfer ( ct ) between the solar wind and neutral gas from the comet gave rise to the observed x - ray emission . in solar - wind charge transfer ,",
    "a highly charged ion in the wind ( usually oxygen or carbon ) collides with neutral gas ( mostly water vapor in the case of comets ) and an electron is transferred from the neutral species into an excited energy level of the wind ion , which then decays and emits an x - ray .",
    "this hypothesis has been proven by subsequent observations of comets such as c / linear 1999 s4 by _ chandra _",
    "@xcite and hyakutake by _ euve _",
    "@xcite ( see also the review by @xcite ) , and is supported by increasingly detailed spectral models @xcite .",
    "a more extensive history of the evolution of the solar - wind ct concept can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    citing the cometary emission model , @xcite pointed out that ct must occur throughout the heliosphere as the solar wind interacts with atomic h and he within the solar system .",
    "@xcite likewise presented _ rosat _  high - resolution imager data that provided some evidence for a correlation between increases in the apparent intensity of comet hyakutake and in the detector background ; he further suggested that this could be caused by charge transfer of the solar wind with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "a rough broad - band quantitative analysis by @xcite predicted that heliospheric emission , along with ct between the solar wind and neutral h in the earth s tenuous outer atmosphere ( geocorona ) , accounts for up to half of the observed soft x - ray background ( sxrb ) .",
    "intriguingly , results from the wisconsin soft x - ray background sky survey @xcite and rass observations @xcite indicate that roughly half of the 1/4-kev background comes from a `` local hot plasma . ''",
    "@xcite also modeled how variations in solar - wind density and speed should affect heliospheric and geocoronal ct emission observed at earth , and found strong correlations between the measured solar - wind proton flux and temporal variations in the _ rosat _  counting rate .    in this paper",

    "the intention was to determine the intrinsic acis detector background by using the moon to block all cosmic x - ray emission .",
    "four of the acis ccds were used in july ( i2 and i3 from the acis - imaging array , and s2 and s3 from the acis - spectroscopy array ) , and the s1 chip was added in september .",
    "two of the chips , s1 and s3 , are back - illuminated ( bi ) and have better quantum efficiency at low energies than the front - illuminated ( fi ) chips , i2 , i3 , and s2 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : moons ] , however , the bi chips have higher intrinsic background than the fi chips , and also poorer energy resolution .",
    "telemetry limits prevented the operation of more ccds when using acis very faint mode , which was desired because of its particle - background rejection utility @xcite .",
    "the acis detector background was also calibrated in an alternative manner using event histogram mode ( ehm ; @xcite ) .",
    "the july moon and ehm spectra from the s3 ship were compared by @xcite and showed good agreement , although there was a noticeable but statistically marginal excess near 600 ev in the moon data .",
    "the dark - moon vs ehm comparison strongly supports the assumption that the high - energy particle background inside the detector housing where ehm data are collected is the same as in the focal position . with that in mind , new calibration measurements were made on 2002 september 3 with acis operating with its standard imaging setup in a `` stowed '' position , where it was both shielded from the sky and removed from the radioactive calibration source in its normal off - duty position .",
    "@xcite . these data ( obsid 62850 , 53 ks ) provide the best available calibration of the intrinsic detector background and are used in the analysis that follows",
    ".      all data were processed to level 1 using _",
    "chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software , pipeline release 6.3.1 , with bad - pixel filtering .",
    "start and stop times for each observation were chosen to exclude spacecraft maneuvers .",
    "apart from the inclusion of cti corrections ( see below ) and a more aggressive exclusion of any possibly questionable data , our data processing is essentially the same as that described by @xcite , who limited their analysis to the july s3 data .",
    "here we use data from all chips during both the july and september observations , and include data from periods of partial dark - moon coverage by using spatial filtering ( see  [ sec : spatial ] ) .",
    "although acis has thinly aluminized filters to limit optical contamination , the sunlit side of the moon was so bright that an excess bias signal was sometimes produced in the ccds , particularly in the i2 and i3 chips that imaged that region during july .",
    "as described in @xcite , a bias correction to each event s pulse height amplitude was calculated by averaging the 16 lowest - signal pixels of the 5@xmath65-pixel very faint ( vf ) mode event island .",
    "obsid 2469 suffered by far the most optical contamination , so that all data from the i2 chip during that observation had to be discarded . the i3 chip also had significant contamination , but it was small enough to be largely corrected . as explained in  [ sec : dataspectra ] ,",
    "however , i3 data from that observation were also excluded as a precaution .",
    "two other july observations required exclusion of some i2 data because of optical leaks ( 930 s in obsid 2490 and 1140 s in obsid 2493 ) , but in all the remaining data the typical energy correction was no more than a few ev , which is insignificant for our purposes .    to improve the effective energy resolution , we applied standard charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) corrections , as implemented in the ciao tool acis_process_events , to data from the fi chips .",
    "cti is much less of a problem in the bi chips , s1 and s3 , and no corrections were made to those chips data .",
    "finally , vf - mode filtering was applied to all the data @xcite to reduce the particle - induced detector background .",
    "the `` acis stowed ''",
    "background data were treated in the same way , except that no optical - contamination corrections were required .      as seen in fig .  [ fig : moons ] , _ chandra _  pointed at a fixed location on the sky during each observation as the moon drifted across the field of view .",
    "using ephemerides for the moon and _ chandra _ s orbit , we calculated the apparent position and size of the moon in 1-minute intervals and extracted data from its dark side , as well as from the bright side and from the unobscured cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) within the field of view for comparison . because the moon moved by up to 16  per minute , and to avoid x - ray `` contamination '' of data within each extraction region ( particularly spillover of bright - side or cxb photons into the dark side ) we used generous buffers of 90  from the terminator and limb for the dark - side extraction , 30  from the terminator and 60  from the limb for bright - side data , and 60  from the limb for the cxb data .",
    "_ chandra _  has a very tight point spread function , with an on - axis encircled energy fraction of nearly 99% at 500 ev within 10  ; although off - axis imaging is involved here , estimated x - ray contamination is less than @xmath7% within our chosen extraction regions .",
    "data from all obsids were analyzed in several energy bands to look for discrete sources but none were found , and lightcurves for each observation behave as would be expected for uniform emission within each extraction region .",
    "effective exposure times ( as if one ccd were fully exposed ) were computed for each obsid / chip / extraction combination by computing extraction areas for each 1-minute interval ( accounting for spacecraft dither , which affects area calculations near the chip edges ) and summing the area@xmath6time products .",

    "weaker flares are more common and we judged it better to model and subtract their small effects rather than exclude large intervals of data .",

    "although raw energy offsets were removed from the data during the bias - correction process , more subtle effects remained , mostly related to charge transfer inefficiency .",
    "optical - leak events partially fill the charge traps in the ccds , thus reducing the net cti . when standard cti corrections were applied to the data to improve the energy resolution of the fi chips , this overcorrected and pushed energies too high for data affected by the optical leak .",

    "such variations may be important when observing weak extended sources such as clusters where background determinations are critical .    with future missions having much better energy resolution , such as _ astro - e2 _ with its 6-ev - fwhm - resolution microcalorimeter array @xcite",
    ", one should be able to see differences in background spectra between areas of the sky corresponding to low and high solar latitudes ( around solar minimum ) because of the difference in ionization levels between the slow and fast solar winds .",
    "it should also be easy to identify spectral features indicative of ct , such as an anomalously strong k@xmath0  forbidden line ( @xmath234 @xmath235 @xmath236 ) . when excited by ct ,",
    "that line is several times stronger than the resonance line ( @xmath237 @xmath238 @xmath236 ) , completely unlike their ratio in thermal plasmas @xcite .",
    "other signatures of ct are the high-@xmath108 lyman transitions of o and c , which are strongly enhanced relative to ly@xmath0 .",
    "indeed , there are hints of high-@xmath108 o lyman lines in a short ( 100 sec ) microcalorimeter observation @xcite .",
    "there is also a strong feature at @xmath239   ( 184 ev ) in the _ diffuse x - ray spectrometer _ ( _ dxs _ ) spectrum of the sxrb @xcite which can not be reproduced by thermal plasma models .",
    "a promising explanation is ct emission at 65.89 and 67.79 (188.16 and 182.89 ev ) from li - like @xmath240 and h - like @xmath241 transitions , which are the strongest ct features within the 148 - 284-ev dxs energy range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : modelspec ] , and note that the plotted resolution is very similar to that for _ astro - e2 _ and _ dxs _ ) .",
    "although variability in foreground emission , whether from changes in the solar wind or in the position of the observing spacecraft with respect to the magnetosphere and heliosphere , can be an annoying complication when analyzing extended sources , variations of ct emission in time and space also provide opportunities to learn more about the solar wind , geocorona , and heliosphere .",
    "data from _",
    "chandra_and _ xmm - newton _ will provide important constraints on our models of ct emission , and future missions such as _ astro - e2 _ should permit definitive tests .",
    "given the unavoidable and rather large uncertainties in current theoretical models , observational data will be critical in this endeavor .",
    "as described in this paper , we have detected significant time - variable soft x - ray emission in _ chandra _  observations of the dark side of the moon which is well explained by our model of geocoronal charge transfer .",
    "the observed brightness ranged from a maximum of @xmath1 phot s@xmath2 arcmin@xmath3 cm@xmath3 , with most of the emission between 500 and 900 ev , to a minimum at least an order of magnitude lower . predicted intensities , which are based in part on detailed solar wind data , match observation to within a factor of two , which is within the model uncertainty .",
    "emission from k@xmath0 , ly@xmath0 , and a blend of high-@xmath108 lyman lines is detected with high confidence , as well as probably k@xmath0  and perhaps high-@xmath108 emission from .",
    "we also include estimates of heliospheric emission and find that the total charge transfer emission amounts to a substantial fraction of the soft x - ray background , roughly one - third of the rate measured in the _ rosat _",
    "future observations with microcalorimeter detectors should allow much more accurate assessments of the contribution of charge transfer emission to the sxrb because of its unique spectral signatures .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge very helpful discussions with c.  grant , p.  plucinsky , j.  raymond , and s.  snowden .",
    "we also thank the _ ace _  swepam and swics instrument teams and the _ ace _  science center for providing their data , and the mit space plasma physics group for the _ imp-8 _  data .",
