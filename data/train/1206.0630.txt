    "the fact that the state space of quantum two - level systems  the bloch ball  and physical space are both three - dimensional and euclidean has been regarded as a remarkable coincidence for many years , provoking interesting ideas and lines of research .",
    "building on this observation , von weizscker  @xcite constructed his `` ur theory '' as an attempt to derive spacetime from quantum mechanics .",
    "similarly , penrose s twistor theory  @xcite was built on the idea that the geometry of physical and quantum state space are fundamentally related , which was elaborated further by wootters  @xcite pointing out the relation between quantum state distinguishability and geometry .",
    "the idea that the quantum bit state space and physical space are somehow logically intertwined has become a widespread paradigm , cf .",
    "but what is the exact relationship  which one of the two determines the other ? could a similarly nice relationship also exist in other dimensions , or is there something special about @xmath1 ?    the goal of this paper is to offer a particular information - theoretic analysis of these questions : we show that a certain natural interplay between geometry and probability is only possible if space has three dimensions , and if outcome probabilities of measurements are exactly as predicted by quantum theory .",
    "this result suggests to explore the idea that neither quantum theory nor spacetime are separately fundamental , but that both might have a common information - theoretic origin .",
    "our approach rests on some natural background assumptions .",
    "suppose that physics takes place in @xmath0 spatial dimensions ( and one time dimension ) , and some of the physical processes involve probabilities .",
    "that is , there exist experiments with random outcomes",
    " we can imagine that physicists , or nature , prepare physical systems in certain _ states _",
    ", and later on , _ measurements _ on the systems reveal outcomes with certain probabilities .",
    "we do _ not _ assume that those probabilities are necessarily described by quantum theory .",
    "then we consider the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_alicebob ] : we have two agents , traditionally called alice and bob .",
    "alice s goal is to send some spatial direction  that is , a unit vector @xmath2  to bob , by encoding it into some state @xmath3 and sending a physical system that carries this state .",
    "we assume that they do not share a common coordinate system , such that alice can not simply send a classical description of @xmath4 .",
    "bob holds a measurement device that can be rotated in space , which he can apply to the state that he received , obtaining one of finitely many possible outcomes .",
    "the outcome probabilities depend continuously on the device s spatial orientation . furthermore , suppose that the following four postulates are satisfied :    * alice can encode any spatial direction @xmath2 into some state such that bob is able to retrieve @xmath4 in the limit of many copies .",
    "* it is impossible for alice to encode any further information into the state without adding noise to the direction information .",
    "* there is a unique way to add up single - system observables on pairs of systems .",
    "* the state - carrying systems can interact pairwise by continuous reversible time evolution .    as we show below",
    ", these postulates can only be satisfied if @xmath1 and if these systems , and pairs of them , are described by quantum theory .",
    "that is , we derive the three - dimensionality of space , two - qubit quantum state space and unitary time evolution as the unique solution .    these postulates declare some actions as _",
    "possible _ or _",
    "impossible _ : it is possible to let two systems interact , but impossible to encode more than a spatial direction into one system ( we define below what this means in detail ) .",
    "this approach is in line with other recent developments like information causality  @xcite , where postulates of impossibility of certain information - theoretic tasks are exploited to derive properties of physical theories .",
    "these approaches also have successful historical examples , like the postulate of impossibility to build a perpetuum mobile of the second kind in thermodynamics .",
    "the approach in this paper may be interpreted as the application of novel mathematical tools to the old question of the relation between geometry and probability .",
    "these tools have their origin in the recent wave of axiomatizations of quantum theory  @xcite , in particular in hardy s seminal work  @xcite , and are inspired by recent work on quantum reference frames  @xcite .",
    "the first part of this paper consists of an introduction to one of these tools , which is the framework of convex state spaces , generalizing quantum theory in a natural way .",
    "then , the first two postulates will be defined in more detail , and will be used to derive the state space of a single system .",
    "finally , joint state spaces and the remaining two postulates will be discussed in detail , yielding our main result . throughout the paper , only the main ideas and proof sketches",
    "are given ; the full proofs are deferred to the appendix .",
    "the framework of convex state spaces  also called general probabilistic theories  has proven useful in the context of quantum information theory  @xcite , but dates back much further  @xcite .",
    "we now give a brief introduction ; other useful introductory sources include  @xcite , in particular chapters 1 and 2 in the paper by mielnik  @xcite .",

    "we have a _ preparation device _ , which , whenever it is operated , generates an instance of a physical system ( for example , a particle ) .",
    "we assume that we can operate the preparation device as often as we want ( say , by pressing a button on the device , or by waiting until a periodic physical process has completed another cycle ) . in the end",
    ", the system can be measured , by applying one of several possible _ measurement devices _ with a finite number of outcomes .",
    "the intuition is that the device prepares the system in a certain fixed state @xmath5 ; operating the preparation device several times produces many independent copies of @xmath5 . to define exactly what we mean by that , consider any fixed measurement device @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath6 is applied to the preparation device s output , we assume that we get one of @xmath7 different measurement outcomes probabilistically , where @xmath8 is an arbitrary natural number ( in fig .  [ fig_preptrafomeas ] , we have @xmath9 , represented by the two dots ) .",

    "suppose we have two devices , both preparing the same type of physical system , but in two different states @xmath14 and @xmath5 .",
    "then we can use them to build a new device that performs a random preparation : it prepares state @xmath5 with probability @xmath15 , and state @xmath14 with probability @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting state will be denoted @xmath17 .",
    "this is a _",
    "convex combination _ of @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "if we apply measurement @xmath6 to that state , we will get the @xmath10-th outcome with probability @xmath18 by the basic laws of probability theory . in summary",
    ", we see that states @xmath5 of some physical system are elements of a real affine space which we denote by some capital letter , say @xmath19 ; single measurement outcomes are described by affine maps @xmath20 which yield values between @xmath21 and @xmath22 for every state .",
    "maps of this kind will be called _",
    "effects_. full measurements are described by a collection of effects @xmath23 that sum to unity if applied to any state .",
    "the _ set of all possible states _ of the corresponding physical system will be denoted @xmath24 , the state space .",
    "it is a bounded subset of @xmath19 .",

    "convex_. we will only consider finite - dimensional state spaces in this paper . since outcome probabilities can only ever be determined to finite precision , we may ( and will ) assume that @xmath24 is topologically closed .    as a simple example , consider a physical system which resembles a classical bit , or coin .",
    "we can perform a measurement by looking whether the coin shows heads or tails ; think of a two - outcome device which yields the first outcome if the coin shows heads , and the second otherwise .",
    "the possible states are then characterized by the probability @xmath29 $ ] of obtaining heads .",

    "quantum state spaces look quite different .",
    "quantum bits , the states of spin-@xmath35 particles , can be described by @xmath36 complex density matrices @xmath37 .",
    "these can always be written in the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an ordinary real vector in @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 denotes the pauli matrices  @xcite .",
    "we can consider @xmath43 as the state of the qubit .",
    "thus , the state space is a three - dimensional unit ball as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d ) .",
    "a spin measurement in the @xmath44-direction may be described by the two effects @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for example , where the two outcomes correspond to `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' , respectively .",
    "however , the state space of a quantum @xmath31-level system is only a ball for @xmath47 ; for @xmath32 , quantum state spaces are _ not _ balls , but intricate compact convex sets of dimension @xmath48  @xcite .    given any state space @xmath24 , all effects , i.e.  affine maps @xmath49 with @xmath50 $ ] describe outcomes of conceivable measurement devices .",
    "we can work out the set of these maps from a description of @xmath24 . in general",
    ", some of these measurements might be physically impossible to implement ; in order to describe a physical system , we have to specify which ones are possible and which ones are not .    from the effects",
    ", we can construct expectation values of observables , simply called _",
    "observables _ in the following .",
    "these are arbitrary affine maps @xmath51 ; in quantum theory , they are maps of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is any self - adjoint matrix . one way to measure an observable ( on many copies of a state ) is to write it as a linear combination of effects , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and to measure the effects @xmath56 on different copies ( in general , they may not be jointly measurable on a single copy and thus be outcomes of different measurement devices ) .",
    "similarly , we can describe _",
    "reversible transformations _ of a physical system : these are physical processes that take a state to another state , and may be inverted by another physical process ( in quantum theory , these are the _ unitaries _ , mapping @xmath37 to @xmath57 )",
    ". since they must respect probabilistic mixtures , they must also be affine maps .",
    "due to reversibility , they map the state space @xmath24 onto itself  they are symmetries of the state space .",
    "the set of reversible transformations on @xmath19 is a closed subgroup @xmath58 of all symmetries of @xmath24 .",
    "we consider a particular situation where measurements take place in @xmath0-dimensional space , with one time dimension . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there is a fixed flat background space , such that there is a unique way to transport vectors from one laboratory @xmath19 to another distant laboratory @xmath59 ( however , we think that our results may apply to more general situations ) .",
    "we will also assume that all physical operations considered in the following , such as measurements , are performed locally in a way such that all parties ( particles , measurement devices etc . )",
    "are relative to each other at rest  .",
    "thus , we do not have to consider conceivable relativistic effects .",
    "in general , there may be many different kinds of physical systems described by convex state spaces .",
    "we now assume that there exists a particular type of physical system which , in a sense to be made precise , behaves like a `` unit of direction information '' .",
    "we will call these systems `` direction bits '' ( later on , we show that they are effectively @xmath60-level systems , therefore `` bits '' , cf .",
    "lemma  [ lembits ] in the appendix ) .",
    "we will not specify by what type of physical object they are carried  a direction bit could , for example , correspond to the internal degrees of freedom of a particle , or it could be something completely different .",
    "we will only assume that a direction bit may come in different states ( matching the framework described above ) , with a state space denoted @xmath61 .",
    "probabilistically . due to symmetry",
    ", its modus operandi depends only on a vector @xmath62 , @xmath63 specifying its `` direction '' in the local laboratory frame .",
    "the probability @xmath64 to obtain the @xmath10-th outcome depends only on the direction bit state @xmath5 and continuously on the direction @xmath65 .",
    "the device can be rotated in space according to any rotation @xmath66 . in the rotated reference frame of the device",
    ", this corresponds to a reversible transformation on the direction bit.,width=264 ]    we assume that direction bits can be measured by a certain type of measurement device with a finite number of outcomes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_directionbit ] , we imagine that the device is implemented as a macroscopic , massive object which can be rotated arbitrarily , i.e.  can be subjected to any @xmath67 rotation .",
    "due to some symmetry of the device , its orientation in space ( locally in the lab ) may be described by a unit vector @xmath68 , @xmath63 , choosing some arbitrary but fixed coordinate system in the local laboratory .",
    "instead of naively thinking of the whole device as `` pointing in direction @xmath65 '' , we may also think that one of the device s components is a vectorial physical quantity which determines the type of measurement that is performed .",
    "a standard example in three dimensions is given by a stern - gerlach device , where @xmath65 is the direction of inhomogeneity of a magnetic field .",
    "the case @xmath69 is special , because @xmath70 is trivial , and thus no one - dimensional rotation can map the unit vector @xmath71 to the unit vector @xmath72 . in order to allow bob to collimate his device in all directions also in @xmath69",
    ", we will thus silently replace @xmath73 by @xmath74 in all of the following .",
    "since the measurement which is performed by the device may depend on its direction @xmath65 in space , it is denoted @xmath75 . in the following , by a `` direction '' ,",
    "we shall always mean a unit vector in @xmath76 .",
    "for obvious physical reasons , we assume that the outcome probabilities @xmath77 are continuous in the direction @xmath65 .",
    "physically , we assume that we can perform a rotation @xmath66 to the measurement device without touching the direction bit ; this transforms @xmath75 to @xmath78 , but leaves the bit s state @xmath5 invariant .",
    "the fact that the outcome probabilities are altered , from @xmath77 to @xmath79 , should be understood as a result of the change in the _ relative _ orientation of the bit and the device .",
    "thus , even though direction bits are considered as informational `` black boxes '' with arbitrary physical realization , we are forced to adopt the interpretation that direction bits carry actual physical geometrical orientation .",
    "this enforces a certain duality that is familiar from quantum mechanics .",
    "suppose that , after rotating the measurement device by @xmath80 , we do not perform the measurement , but instead rotate the _ joint system of direction bit and measurement device back _ by @xmath81 .",
    "if it is physically unclear how to do this in practice , we can just imagine performing a passive coordinate transformation .",
    "since this transformation does not change the relative direction of the system and measurement apparatus , it does not alter the outcome probabilities .",
    "however , by changing to the new coordinate system , @xmath78 has been transformed back to @xmath75 , hence the direction bit state must have changed from @xmath5 to some other state @xmath82 such that @xmath83 .",
    "the state transformation @xmath84 can be physically undone ( by rotating the joint system again by @xmath80 ) , hence it must be an element of the group of _ reversible transformations _ on @xmath61 .",
    "we call it @xmath85 , such that we can switch from the `` heisenberg '' to the `` schrdinger '' picture via @xmath86 clearly @xmath87 ; in other words , the map @xmath88 is a group representation of @xmath67 on the direction bit state space .",
    "now suppose we have a situation where two agents ( alice and bob ) reside in distant laboratories as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_alicebob ] .",
    "imagine that alice holds an actual physical vector @xmath2 _",
    "( all vectors and rotations will be denoted with respect to alice s local coordinate system in the following ) _ , and she would like to send this geometric information to bob .",
    "since alice and bob have never met , they have never agreed on a common coordinate system .",
    "thus , it is useless for bob if alice sends him a classical description of @xmath4 , because he does not know what coordinate system the description is referring to .",
    "however , if bob holds a measurement device as in fig .",
    "[ fig_directionbit ] , alice can send him a direction bit in some state @xmath5 . as usual in information theory ( taking into account the statistical definition of states ) , we analyze the properties of a single state @xmath5 by considering many identical copies of that state .",
    "so suppose alice sends many independent copies of @xmath5 to bob .",
    "on every copy , bob can measure in a different direction , and he may find that some outcome probabilities are varying over the different directions @xmath68 , @xmath63 .",
    "this breaks rotational symmetry , and so may be used by alice to send physical direction information to bob .",
    "however , alice can not send information about the _ length _ of the vector @xmath4 to bob , if we assume that bob can only rotate his device ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig_directionbit ] ) and not more .",
    "thus , restricting to the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig_alicebob ] , we state that _",
    "alice s task is to send a direction vector @xmath2 , @xmath89 , to bob , by encoding it into some state_.    * postulate 1 ( encoding ) .",
    "* there is a protocol ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig_alicebob ] ) which allows alice to encode all spatial directions @xmath2 , @xmath89 , into states @xmath90 , such that bob is able to retrieve @xmath4 in the limit of many copies .",
    "denote the coordinates of some vector @xmath2 in bob s local coordinate system by @xmath91 .",
    "then we stipulate that after obtaining @xmath31 copies of @xmath3 , bob makes a guess @xmath92 of @xmath91 ( based on his previous measurement outcomes ) such that @xmath93 for @xmath94 with probability one . for obvious physical reasons",
    ", we assume that alice s encoding @xmath95 is continuous   which works . ] .",
    "moreover , bob measures each direction bit individually and only once ( we may imagine that direction bits get destroyed upon measurement  ) .    in principle",
    ", direction bits might carry further additional information that can be read out in measurements . as a naive example",
    ", the physical system that alice transmits could be a simple wristwatch , with the watch hand pointing in the direction that alice is intending to send .",
    "however , a wristwatch is hardly `` economical '' for this task : it carries a large amount of additional information , like the details of its head shape etc .",
    "our second postulate says that direction bits should be `` minimal '' in their ability to carry directional information : any attempt to encode further information can only succeed at the expense of loosing some of the directional information .    *",
    "postulate 2 ( minimality ) . *",
    "no protocol allows alice to encode any further information into the state without adding noise to the directional information .    to spell out the mathematical details",
    ", we need to define what it means that one state @xmath14 is noisier in its directional information than another state @xmath5 .",
    "first , by directional information of @xmath14 , we mean the probability functions @xmath96 as seen by direction bit measurement device .",
    "if we have two states @xmath97 with directional probabilities related by a rotation , i.e.  @xmath98 for some rotation @xmath66 and all @xmath10 , we argue that both states are _ equally noisy _ in this respect  they both contain the same `` amount of asymmetry '' , just pointing in different directions .",
    "we could additionally say that @xmath14 and @xmath5 are equally noisy if @xmath99 for some entropy measure @xmath100 ; however , there is no unique entropy definition for arbitrary state spaces  @xcite , and entropy measures acquire meaning only relative to certain operationally defined tasks which is a complication we want to avoid .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath14 to be _ at least as noisy in its directional information as @xmath5 _ if its directional probabilities are statistical mixtures of those of @xmath5 and other states that are equally noisy as @xmath5 ; that is , if there are statistical weights @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and rotations @xmath103 such that for all outcomes @xmath10 , @xmath104 clearly , @xmath14 is _ noisier than @xmath5 in its directional information _ if it is at least as noisy , and at the same time not equally noisy as @xmath5 . in definition  [ defnoisiness ] and following in appendix  [ appdirbit ] , we show that this notion is a natural generalization of the _ majorization _ relation  @xcite from classical probability theory and quantum theory .",
    "it also has a natural interpretation in terms of _ resource theories _",
    "@xcite : for any given @xmath5 , the probability functions @xmath105  or rather their directional asymmetry  constitute a resource for bob .",
    "one resource is less useful  that is , more noisy  than the other if it can be obtained from the other by `` free '' operations ; in this case , by tossing a coin and performing a random rotation .",
    "suppose we had a protocol that satisfied postulate 1 , and two states @xmath106 that would work as a possible encoding of some direction @xmath4 , in the sense that bob would in both cases decode direction @xmath4 in the limit of obtaining infinitely many copies .",
    "then , by choosing to send either @xmath14 or @xmath5 , alice could send an additional classical bit to bob .",
    "postulate 2 says that this is only possible at the expense of adding noise  that is , one of the two states must be noisier in its directional information than the other .",
    "our goal is to determine the shape of the convex state space of a direction bit , using only postulates 1 and 2 and the physical background assumptions ( postulates 3 and 4 will be considered later ) . to this end , suppose alice encodes some direction @xmath4 according to some protocol into a state @xmath3 and sends many copies of it to bob .",
    "if the protocol satisfies postulates 1 and 2 , bob will be able to decode @xmath4 .",
    "now suppose that bob secretly performed a rotation @xmath66 on his laboratory before the protocol started .",
    "since the protocol must work regardless of the relative orientation of alice and bob , bob will still succeed to obtain an accurate estimate of @xmath4 as before .",
    "as we have seen , applying @xmath80 to a measurement device can be replaced by applying @xmath85 to the direction bit state .",
    "therefore , the following implementation will also allow bob to guess @xmath4 :    * apply @xmath85 to every incoming direction bit ; measure as in the protocol above . * after obtaining @xmath31 copies , determine the guess @xmath107 given by the protocol above . * to compensate for the missing lab rotation , output the guess @xmath108 .",
    "suppose that @xmath80 is in the stabilizer subgroup of @xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath109 .",
    "then the lines above prove that the original protocol also works if alice sends the state @xmath110 to bob instead of @xmath3 .",
    "but these states are equally noisy in their directional information , hence postulate 2 implies that they are equal . in other words ,",
    "we have shown the following :    _ for any encoding @xmath95 , the state @xmath3 is invariant with respect to all rotations that leave @xmath4 invariant . _    for what follows , fix @xmath111 and an arbitrary protocol that satisfies postulates 1 and 2 , yielding a state @xmath3 that encodes direction @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath109 , then @xmath112 thus , for every @xmath10 , the probability @xmath113 is a function of the first component of @xmath65 . as we show in lemma  [ lemnottoosymmetric ] in appendix  [ appdirbit ] , this has the following consequence : there is at least one measurement outcome ( call it @xmath114 ) and one direction @xmath65 such that @xmath115  otherwise , the state @xmath3 would be `` too symmetric '' to allow the transmission of direction information , and postulate 1 would be violated .",
    "fix this @xmath114 . for every direction @xmath65 that satisfies the inequality above ( there might be more than one )",

    "the new protocol works as follows :    * alice encodes some direction @xmath4 into the state @xmath128 and sends many copies of it to bob . * by measuring the received copies , bob determines a good estimate of the function @xmath129 .",
    "bob s guess is the vector @xmath44 for which @xmath130 is maximal .",
    "remarkably , from an _ arbitrary _ protocol to transmit direction information , we have constructed a _",
    "standard protocol_. this involves a difference @xmath131 , which has striking similarity to the spin-@xmath35 angular momentum expectation value in quantum mechanics   instead of @xmath132 .",
    "however , it is not clear how the existence of any state @xmath5 with a unique maximum of @xmath133 can be ensured in this case , at this stage of the proof . ] : this expression is the expectation value of a random variable which assigns `` @xmath134 '' to direction @xmath44 , and `` @xmath135 '' to direction @xmath136 .",
    "since the new protocol allows alice to transmit arbitrary spatial directions to bob , it must satisfy postulate 2 .",
    "thus , if we have two states @xmath5 and @xmath14 that satisfy @xmath137 _ and _ @xmath138 for all @xmath123 , they must either be equal , or one must be strictly noisier than the other , as in eq .",
    "( [ eqnoisiness ] ) ( exchanging the names @xmath139 if it is the other way round ) .",
    "as we prove in lemma  [ lemnoisysod ] in appendix  [ appdirbit ] , this equation implies for the states themselves that @xmath140 , as states turn out to be uniquely determined by their directional information . since both @xmath5 and @xmath14 can be used as codewords for direction @xmath65 in our standard protocol , our intermediate result one page above implies that @xmath141 and @xmath142 for all @xmath66 with @xmath143 .",

    "the state space of a direction bit is a @xmath0-dimensional unit ball .",
    "this shows that a direction bit can not be described by a classical probability distribution : it must carry a non - classical state space , exhibiting uncertainty relations among @xmath0 independent , mutually complementary measurements .",
    "probabilistic systems of this type , i.e.  ball state spaces , have been studied before  @xcite . in quantum physics as we know it , there is only one kind of system with a ball state space : it is the qubit , a quantum @xmath60-level state space .",
    "it is three - dimensional , which coincides with the spatial dimension , confirming the result we just proved . by classifying the affine maps from the ball to @xmath201 $ ] ,",

    "note first that two states @xmath97 , with corresponding `` bloch vectors '' @xmath207 in the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean unit ball , are equally noisy in their directional information if and only if @xmath208 ; similarly , @xmath14 is noisier than @xmath5 if and only if @xmath209 ( in the case @xmath1 , where the state space is a qubit , this condition becomes @xmath210 ) . for any protocol , and any spherical shell of fixed bloch vector norm , there is a one - to - one correspondence of states in that shell and spatial directions that these states encode .",
    "thus , if two different states encode the same direction , they must have different norms , and so one is noisier than the other .",
    "we say more about the different possible protocols in lemma  [ lemformprotocol ] in the appendix .",
    "before we formulate postulates 3 and 4 and prove more properties of direction bits , let us reconsider one basic assumption . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_directionbit ] , we have assumed that the orientation of a measurement device in space is given by a direction vector , implicitly assuming some internal rotational symmetry of the device .",
    "what if we drop this assumption ? in general , the orientation of a massive body in @xmath76 is given by an orthonormal frame , that is , by some oriented orthonormal basis that can be written in the form of an orthogonal matrix @xmath211 , instead of a unit vector @xmath2 .",
    "thus , an interesting question is what happens if we repeat the calculations above , formulating analogues of the postulates for `` frame bits '' instead of direction bits .    while we have to leave the general answer open",
    ", we can give the answer in a particular special case .",
    "first , note that for _ direction bits _ as considered above , our calculations show that alice and bob can also apply the following protocol :    * alice encodes spatial directions @xmath2 into the particular states @xmath157 .",
    "* bob holds a two - outcome measurement device , where the first outcome is described by the effect @xmath75 , with @xmath65 the direction in which the device is pointing . upon receiving ( many copies of ) some state @xmath5",
    ", bob looks for the spatial direction @xmath65 in which @xmath212 is maximal , which will be his guess of alice s direction @xmath4 .    effectively , the device that bob holds asks the yes - no - question `` is it _ this _ direction that alice encoded ? ''",
    "the actual direction is the one in which the probability to obtain `` yes '' is maximal .",
    "let us now ask whether we can implement the analogous protocol for the case that alice wants to send a frame @xmath211 .",
    "the main idea is that @xmath213 is used to denote the spatial orientation of an orthonormal frame attached to an object , with the @xmath10-th orthonormal vector pointing in direction @xmath214 ; rotations @xmath66 will thus map this to @xmath215 .",
    "the protocol is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_alicebobx ] .",
    "we formulate analogues of postulates 1 and 2 ( encoding and minimality ) for this setup , and consider them only in the special case of this protocol .",
    "as we show in appendix  [ appendixx ] , a calculation very similar to the one above proves that the `` frame bit '' state space must be generated by pure states @xmath216 , labelled now by orthogonal matrices @xmath217 that are connected by rotations .",
    "in complete analogy to above , every state @xmath5 can be written in the form @xmath218 , where @xmath176 , @xmath164 is a maximally mixed state , and @xmath217 some frame .",
    "thus , the frame bit state space must also be a euclidean ball of some dimension @xmath178 .    at this point",
    ", we run into a topological problem : similarly as for direction bits , the map @xmath219 turns out to be a homeomorphism , this time from @xmath67 to the unit sphere on @xmath199 .",
    "since @xmath67 is not simply connected for @xmath220 , but the unit sphere in @xmath199 is simply connected for @xmath221 , this is only possible if @xmath222 and thus ( from dimension counting ) @xmath223 .",
    "thus , we have proven that _ there is no convex state space that allows implementation of this protocol , while satisfying analogues of postulates 1 and 2 _  unless @xmath223 , where a frame is the same as a spatial direction , and the setup reduces to the concept of the direction bit .",
    "( we will rule out @xmath223 in section  [ secpairs ] , using two further postulates . )",
    "before continuing our derivation , we take another slight detour by asking for the relationship between the geometry of physical space and state space .    as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig_directionbit ] , our setting assumes that macroscopic objects can be physically rotated .",
    "the implicit assumption behind this is that local physical space in the laboratory is a vector space with a euclidean structure , that is , with an inner product , that determines the notion of a rotation as a linear orthogonal map and , at the same time , allows to compute angles between vectors .",
    "we assume that physical rotations @xmath66 have representations @xmath224 on the direction bit state space @xmath19 . as we show in lemma  [ eqr ] in appendix  [ appdirbit ]",
    ", group theory dictates that the map @xmath88 is linear and , moreover , that it is of the form @xmath225 for some orthogonal matrix @xmath226 .",
    "thus , there is automatically a correspondence between the vector space and euclidean structures of state space and physical space .",
    "this has an interesting consequence : it implies that _ observers can measure physical angles by measuring probabilities_. in other words : even if an observer has no meter stick to measure physical angles , she may infer physical angles from probabilities .    in appendix  [ appspatialgeometry ]",
    ", we give a boot - strapped protocol that allows observers to determine angles from probability measurements on direction bits .",
    "this method generalizes the simple quantum - mechanical insight that polarized electrons with spin - up in a fixed direction give probability of spin - up in another direction ( of relative angle @xmath227 ) with probability @xmath228 .",
    "this structural coincidence ( which is in particular true for quantum theory ) seems remarkable beyond the specific derivation in this paper . clearly , in this work , we start with postulates that _ assume _ a euclidean structure in physical space , and obtain the ball state space with its reversible rotation transformations _ as a consequence_. it is then not very surprising , though mathematically not trivial , that observers can use this state space structure to obtain information on spatial angles .",
    "however , irrespective of the specific construction in this paper , it is interesting to speculate whether the physically fundamental order of logic ( if there is any ) might actually be reversed . in example",
    "[ extopmf ] in appendix  [ appspatialgeometry ] , we give a modification of the direction bit setup where this speculation can be shown to make sense .    in this example , space is described by a topological manifold , and bob s local laboratory space does not have a vector space structure or inner product to begin with .",
    "we then assume that there are physical processes that can in a certain sense be interpreted as generalized rotations of a device , yielding reversible transformations on some convex state space . under specific conditions ,",
    "we show that bob can use the coefficients of the measurement outcome probabilities in the space of effects to define natural coordinates on his local physical space .",
    "in these new coordinates , the generalized rotations act linearly and orthogonally on the devices , establishing spatial euclidean structure that was not assumed to be there in the first place .",
    "even though our particular example is not meant to describe an actual physical mechanism , it is tempting to speculate whether the euclidean structure of tangent space might be fundamentally inherited from the convexity of probabilities .",
    "consider two ( distinguishable ) direction bits @xmath19 and @xmath59 ; taken together , they form a joint system @xmath229 , described by some convex state space @xmath230 . in the usual formulation of quantum theory , the joint state space @xmath230 would be given by the density matrices on the tensor product hilbert space  however , in this paper , we do not assume quantum theory .    in full generality , for two state spaces",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath231 , the framework of convex state spaces allows infinitely many possible ways to combine them into some @xmath230 , restricted only by a few physically obvious constraints .",

    "classical as well as quantum physics have an important structural property regarding composite systems : suppose we have two systems @xmath19 and @xmath59 of the same type , and @xmath239 is a single - system observable ( in quantum theory , where states @xmath240 are density matrices , this would be a map @xmath241 , where @xmath53 ) .",

    "@xcite do most of the work : they show that only @xmath1 is possible . as a last step , in order to obtain quantum theory for @xmath1 , we refer to the results in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we start with a formal definition of state spaces .",
    "as we have motivated in the main text , the set of normalized states on any system is a compact convex set . to simplify the calculations",
    ", it makes sense to start right away with the full set of _ unnormalized _ states , which will be all vectors of the form @xmath306 , where @xmath5 is a normalized state , and @xmath307 .",
    "this yields a _ cone _ in the sense of convex geometry  that is , a subset @xmath308 of a vector space with the property that @xmath309 implies @xmath310 for all @xmath307 .    for reasons of brevity",
    ", we will not give a detailed explanation and motivation of all definitions .",
    "for more discussion , we refer the reader to the references mentioned in the main text , in particular to chapter 3 in  @xcite .    a _ state space _ is a tuple @xmath311 , where    * @xmath19 is a real finite - dimensional vector space , * @xmath312 is a proper cone ( that is , a closed , convex cone of full dimension with @xmath313 ) , called the _ cone of unnormalized states _ , *",
    "@xmath314 is a linear functional which is strictly positive on @xmath315 , called the _ order unit _ of @xmath19 , * @xmath316 is a closed convex set of functionals which are non - negative on all of @xmath317 , containing @xmath314 , having full dimension @xmath318 , and satisfying @xmath319 for all @xmath320 and @xmath321 .",
    "it is called the _ set of allowed effects_.    furthermore , we define the _ dual cone _ @xmath322 as the set of all linear functionals which are non - negative on @xmath317 , which implies @xmath323 .",
    "the set of all @xmath324 with @xmath325 will be denoted @xmath24 and is called the _ set of normalized states_.    the requirement @xmath318 has a simple physical motivation : if @xmath326 , then we would have states @xmath327 that would yield the same outcome probabilities for all possible measurements , invalidating to call them `` different states '' in the first place .    to save some ink , we will usually just write @xmath19 for the state space , instead of writing the full tuple .",
    "however , keep in mind that the choice of a state space comes also with a choice of @xmath317 , @xmath314 and @xmath316 .    given any measurement with an arbitrary number of outcomes , the probability of one of the outcomes ",
    "if measured on some state @xmath25  will be a real number in @xmath201 $ ] .",
    "the map @xmath6 which takes the state @xmath5 to the corresponding probability @xmath328 must be linear , since statistical mixtures of states must yield mixtures of probabilities . in principle , every linear functional @xmath329 may describe a measurement outcome probability , where @xmath330",
    "however , one may imagine that it might be physically impossible to implement measurement devices for all these linear functionals .",
    "this is why the set @xmath316 is introduced in the definition above : it is meant to describe the collection of all possible effects that may actually be implemented in measurements . clearly , we have @xmath331 . in some publications",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , it is assumed that @xmath332 , but not in this paper . in other words",
    ", we are _ not _ assuming the `` no - restriction hypothesis '' here  @xcite .",
    "the possibility to have @xmath333 describes situations , as we will see below , where all measurements on a direction bit are by necessity intrinsically noisy .    as an example , in finite - dimensional @xmath31-level quantum theory ,    * @xmath19 is the real vector space of hermitian matrices on @xmath334 , * @xmath317 is the set of positive semi - definite matrices on @xmath334 , * @xmath335 is the trace functional ,",
    "* @xmath316 is the set of all maps of the form @xmath336 , with @xmath337 a positive semi - definite matrix , * @xmath24 is the set of density matrices on @xmath334 .    similarly , the state space of classical @xmath31-level probability theory is @xmath338 , where    * @xmath339 , * @xmath340 , * @xmath341 , * @xmath342 is the set of all maps @xmath343 with @xmath344 such that all @xmath345 , where @xmath346 denotes the euclidean inner product , * @xmath231 is the set of all probability distributions : @xmath347    in both classical probability theory and quantum theory , all effects are allowed .",
    "we would like to talk about reversible transformations on state spaces .",

    "these two conditions say that reversible transformations must respect the set of normalized states and the set of allowed effects .",
    "it is easy to see that the first condition implies that @xmath354 for all @xmath349 .    in quantum theory",
    ", @xmath58 is the group of all maps of the form @xmath355 , with @xmath356 unitary . in classical probability theory",
