    "there is growing evidence that most galaxies have the supermassive black holes at their centers ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a classical review ) . the remarkable evidence for supermassive black holes is provided by the existence of a gas disk with keplerian rotation on a subparsec scale found by the radio observations @xcite and by the asymmetric iron line profile discovered by the x - ray observations @xcite . in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole ,",
    "the gas in the disk is heated up and produces very high luminosity by efficiently transforming their gravitational energy into radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , such rotating gas disks with accretion flow are considered as the energy sources of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasars .",
    "recently , it has been widely accepted that the supermassive black holes play an important role not only in the activities of agns and quasars but also in the formation and global evolution of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite    , and references therein ) .",
    "the discovery of the tight correlation between black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of the bulge component of galaxies @xcite supports the scenario that the black holes have grown up in mass through the hierarchical galaxy mergers , just as galaxies themselves did .",
    "if this scenario is correct , the supermassive binary black holes ( bbhs ) will be inevitably formed during the course of galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "there are actually a number of observational indications that some galaxies harbour supermassive bbhs at their centers .",
    "main results are listed as follows ( see also ) ;    * periodic optical and radio outbursts ( e.g. , oj287 ) @xcite . * wiggled patterns of the radio jet indicating precessional motions on a parsec scale @xcite . *",
    "x - shaped morphology of radio lobes @xcite .",
    "* double peaked broad emission lines in agns @xcite . *",
    "double compact cores with the flat radio spectrum @xcite . *",
    "orbital motion of the compact core @xcite .",
    "it is believed that the supermassive bbhs evolve mainly via three stages @xcite .",
    "firstly , each of black holes sinks independently towards the center of the common gravitational potential due to the dynamical friction with neighboring stars .",
    "when the separation between two black holes becomes as short as @xmath0 or so , angular momentum loss by the dynamical friction slows down due to the loss - cone effect and a supermassive hard binary is formed .",
    "this is the second stage .",
    "finally , when the semi - major axis of the binary decreases to less than @xmath1 , gravitational radiation dominates and then a pair of black holes , eventually , merge into a single supermassive black hole .",
    "if there is the gas orbiting around the supermassive bbhs in the second evolutionary stage , one will be able to observe a signal arising from the interaction between the binary and its surrounding gas ( i.e. a circumbinary disk )",
    ". this disk - binary interaction could be also the predominant candidate to resolve the loss - cone problem ( ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "an orbital angular momentum of the supermassive bbhs is transferred to the circumbinary disk , by which the gas around the supermassive bbhs will be swept away .",
    "in addition , we expect that the mass inflow will take place from the circumbinary disk to the supermassive bbhs , leading to the formation of accretion disks around each of black holes ( i.e. circumblack - hole disks )",
    ". a final configuration could be three - disk systems ; one circumbinary disk and two circumblack - hole disks ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] for a schematic view of supermassive bbhs ) .    such three - disk systems have been also discussed in the context of binary star formation , where the binary is composed of young stars .",
    "@xcite found that the material can infall on to the central binary through the gap between the circumbinary disk and the central binary , and that its accretion rate modulates with the orbital phase .",
    "since then , the theory of the young binary star formation has been extensively studied @xcite . some basic processes involved with the disk - binary interaction",
    "have been revealed through these researches . despite its significance ,",
    "however , it is poorly known how the material accretes onto supermassive bbhs from the circumbinary disk under the realistic situations . @xcite only discussed briefly the quasi - periodic behavior of optical / infrared outbursts in a blazar oj287 in terms of the strong phase - dependent accretion onto supermassive bbhs ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", therefore , we elucidate the theory of accretion processes in supermassive binary black - hole systems by performing smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations . our ultimate goal is to give an observable diagnosis for the presence of supermassive bbhs in central region of merged galaxies .",
    "the simulation should ideally take account of all the processes at work in the three - disk systems , including the circumbinary disk evolution around the supermassive bbhs , the mass transfer from the circumbinary disk to the individual black holes , and the accretion onto each of black holes .",
    "such a simulation , however , would require an enormous computational time .",
    "therefore , we confine ourselves to simulate only the accretion flow from the circumbinary disk onto the supermassive bbhs .",
    "detailed structure and evolution of the circumblack - hole disks will be reported in a subsequent paper .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : we first describe our numerical model in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "then , our numerical results will be reported in section  [ sec : acc ] for the basic processes involved with mass accretion onto the circular , equal - mass binary , and in section  [ sec : uneq_ecc ] for the effects of the orbital eccentricity and the unequal masses of the binary .",
    "we then discuss the observational implications and the related issues in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "[ subsec : basiceq ] simulations presented here were performed with a three - dimensional ( 3d ) sph code .",
    "the sph code is basically the same as that used by ( ) , and is based on a version originally developed by benz @xcite .",
    "the sph equations with the standard cubic - spline kernel are integrated using a second - order runge - kutta - fehlberg integrator with individual time steps for each particle @xcite , which results in saving an enormous computational time when a large range of dynamical timescales are involved .",
    "we first give the basic equations and then describe the implementations to the sph code .        in the sph calculations ,",
    "each particle has a density distribution over a spatial scale of the smoothing length , @xmath2 , around its center .",
    "hence , the density at the position of particle @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is given by a weighted summation over the masses of the particle @xmath3 itself and its neighboring particles ( hereafter , neighbors ) , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the mass of the particle @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the number of the neighbors of the particle @xmath3 , @xmath9 is the distance between the particles @xmath3 and @xmath7 , @xmath10 is the mean smoothing length , and @xmath11 is call the kernel .",
    "we adopt the standard cubic - spline kernel @xmath11 for 3d ; that is , @xmath12 where @xmath13 . the mass conservation is thus automatically satisfied .",
    "the momentum equation for the fluid under a gravity in the inertia frame is written by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lagrangian derivative , @xmath16 is the velocity field , @xmath17 is the pressure , @xmath18 is the viscous force , and @xmath19 is the gravitational potential by the bbhs .",
    "self - gravity of the gas particles is neglected .",
    "the corresponding sph momentum equation for the @xmath3-th particle in the potential of a pair of black holes is then @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the velocity of the @xmath3-th particle , @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the masses of the primary and secondary black holes , respectively , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the position vectors of the primary and secondary black holes , respectively , and @xmath27 is the sph artificial viscosity with the following standard form @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the linear and non - linear artificial viscosity parameters , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 . the connection with the disk viscosity will be described in subsection 2.2.3 .      the pressure term @xmath17 in the momentum equation is calculated by the isothermal equation of state ; @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the isothermal sound speed of the gas .",
    "we do not need to explicitly solve an energy equation .",
    "viscosity is essential in the disk simulations , while the sph formalism already contains the artificial viscosity .",
    "there is an approximate relation connecting the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath37 and the sph artificial viscosity parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the outline of formalism is presented below in the same procedure as that of section 2.1 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the sph viscous force becomes @xmath38 \\label{eq:9}\\ ] ] in the 3d continuum limit of equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) , assuming that the density varies on a length - scale much longer than that of the velocity .",
    "this implies that the shear viscosity @xmath39 and the bulk viscosity @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "according to the @xmath43 viscosity prescription @xcite , on the other hand , the shear viscosity is written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the disk scale - height and @xmath37 is the viscosity parameter .",
    "> from the combinations of equations  ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:12 ] ) , we find the relation connecting @xmath29 and @xmath37 as @xmath46 as long as @xmath47 holds .",
    "however , we usually find @xmath48 in general flows .",
    "moreover , the viscosity is artificially tuned off for divergent flows in our model ( see equation  [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , equation  ( [ eq:13 ] ) should be taken as a rough approximation to relate @xmath29 to @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt a constant value of @xmath49 throughout the simulations .",
    "hence , @xmath50 is variable in space and time , while @xmath51 everywhere .",
    "we put a pair of black holes on the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane with the semi - major axis of the binary orbit being along the @xmath52-axis initially and the center of mass being at the origin . in the case of an eccentric binary",
    ", we set a pair of black holes initially with the minimum separation ( i.e. , at the periastron ) .",
    "that is , black holes are initially at @xmath54 and at @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the semi - major axis and @xmath57 is the eccentricity .",
    "in addition , each black hole is given an appropriate initial rotation velocity so as to orbit around the origin with given @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "in the present study , we fix @xmath58 . as for the eccentricity , we calculate two cases ; @xmath59 , and 0.5 .",
    "the unit of time is @xmath60 , unless noted otherwise .",
    "we assume that the black holes are both schwarzschild black holes .",
    "the masses of the primary and the secondary black holes are @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the binary has the mass ratio @xmath63 and the total mass @xmath64 .",
    "the black holes are modeled by sink particles with the fixed accretion radius of @xmath65 which are @xmath66 times as large as the schwarzschild radius .",
    "numerically , we take away all the particles which enter the region inside @xmath67 . to ensure that the simulation results do not depend on the accretion radius , we also performed a simulation with @xmath68 , finding no qualitative and quantitative differences within estimated errors of @xmath69 .",
    "the circumbinary disk is initially set around the common center of mass of the supermassive bbhs , which is coplanar with the binary orbital plane .",
    "it has a radially random density profile over a width of @xmath70 and a vertically isothermal , thin disk density profile .",
    "its initial mass is @xmath71 .",
    "the disk temperature is assumed to be @xmath72 everywhere .",
    "note that this temperature roughly corresponds to the typical effective temperature of a standard disk around a single black hole with @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the disk material is rotating around the origin with the keplerian rotation velocity .",
    "the gas particles are added randomly at the radius of the initial outer edge of the circumbinary disk , at a constant rate , @xmath74 in all the calculated models .",
    "the inner edge of the circumbinary disk depends on the orbital eccentricity . in the circular binary ,",
    "we take the radius of @xmath75 corresponding to the tidal truncation radius where the tidal torque of the binary equals to the viscous torque of the circumbinary disk . a circumbinary disk around a circular binary is truncated at this radius @xcite .",
    "the tidal truncation radii for circular binaries with non - extreme masses are distributed between @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see table  1 of @xcite ) . in the eccentric binary , on the other hand , we take the ( 2,1 ) corotation radius at @xmath78 ( see section [ subsec : overview2 ] for the detailed explanation ) .",
    "we set an outer calculation boundary at @xmath79 , which is sufficiently far from the disk region so that the outer boundary should not affect the flow dynamics in the supermassive bbh systems .",
    "the sph particles passing outward across the outer boundary are removed from the simulation .      in our code",
    ", the accretion flow is modeled by an ensemble of gas particles , each of which has a negligible mass chosen to be @xmath80 with a variable smoothing length .",
    "we have carried out several simulations with different parameters .",
    "the parameters adopted by the calculated models are summarized in table  1 .    to check",
    "if the number of sph particles used in this study is large enough , we also performed the same simulation as in model  1 but with about a half as many particles , finding no appreciable changes . in order to see the validity of the simulations",
    ", we also checked several simulation values , such as the ratio of the smoothing length to the disk scale - height @xmath81 , the ratio of the smoothing length to the disk radius @xmath82 , and the relative disk scale - height @xmath83 , respectively . here the disk scale - height @xmath45 is defined as the half thickness at which the density decreases by a factor of @xmath84 .",
    "we have found @xmath85 in the range of @xmath86 ; that is , the radial structure of the circumbinary disk is well resolved .",
    "we also found @xmath87 at the inner edge of the disk , which ensures the justification of the size of accretion radius , @xmath65 .",
    "the disk is geometrically thin because of @xmath88 over the whole radial region , as expected from the standard disk theory .",
    "however , the vertical structure of the disk is not resolved by our sph simulations , since we find @xmath89 .",
    "we , hence , focus our discussion on the radial structure and the detailed explanation of vertical structure is beyond the scope of the present paper .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we have already discussed in section  [ subsec : diskform ] a possibility of the formation of the circumblack - hole disks and estimated their viscous timescales at the circularization radii . in this section , we discuss whether the circumblack - hole disks are persistent or not during one orbital period and how viscous accretion processes affect the evolution and structure of the circumblack - hole disk .",
    "table  [ tbl : results ] summarizes the mean mass - capture rates , the mean circularization radii , and the mean viscous timescales of all the calculated models . to reduce the fluctuation noise ,",
    "the simulation data are folded on the orbital period over @xmath90 in models  1 and 3 , and over @xmath91 in models  2 and 4 .",
    "the second and the third columns denote the mean mass - capture rates of the primary and the secondary black holes , respectively .",
    "these columns clearly show that the sum of the mean mass - capture rates by the bbhs in the circular binaries is higher than that in the eccentric binaries .",
    "this implies that the circumblack - hole disks in the circular binaries are denser than those in the eccentric binaries .",
    "we see from the fourth column and the fifth column of table  [ tbl : results ] , which denote the mean circularization radii around each black hole , that the size of the circumblack - hole disks in the circular binaries is larger than that in the eccentric binaries . in model  3 ,",
    "the disk size of the secondary black hole , @xmath92 , is larger than the accretion radius , @xmath65 .",
    "this means that some of the mass which enters the sphere of @xmath65 may finally go out , without being captured by the black hole .    for comparison with model  1",
    ", we ve performed the other simulation model with the initially more extended circumbinary disk ; the disk - inner edge 1.68a and the disk - outer edge 2.0a where the mass is injected ( see section  [ subsec : supply - capture ] ) .",
    "although the circularization radii are less than half those of model  1 , our conclusion regarding the formation of circumblack - hole disks is unchanged .",
    "the last two columns of tabel  [ tbl : results ] represent the mean viscous time - scale of the primary black hole and of the secondary one , respectively .",
    "these are estimated by using equation  [ eq : ts ] and [ eq : ts ] .",
    "it is clear from these columns that the viscous time - scale is much longer than the orbital period in all the models .",
    "thus , the circumblack - hole disks once formed , they will survive over the whole orbital phase .",
    "the viscosity in the circumblack - hole disks gives little influence on their structure and short - term evolution on the timescale of the order of the orbital period .",
    "the phase - dependent accretion flows are likely to give a good impact on the outer edge of the circumblack - hole disks",
    ". this will be able to excite one - armed oscillations on the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as the one - armed waves propagates , the material on the outer region of the disk is inwardly pushed towards the central black hole .",
    "since the propagation time - scale is roughly estimated by using @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the viscous time - scale of circumblack - hole disks ( see @xcite ) , as @xmath95 , the outer region of the disk can significantly vary , whereas the inner region of the disk may remain to be unchanged .",
    "we thus expect that optical / ir radiation emitted mainly from the outer portions will exhibit significant periodic variations , whereas radio and x - ray emissions coming from the innermost region may not show such periodic and coherent variations ( however , see the later section  [ subsec : shock ] )",
    ". if this is the case , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) will be highly time - variable on the orbital timescale .",
    "it is likely that the mass exchanges occur via an effective l1 point between the disks around the primary and secondary black holes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the phase - dependent mass inflow from the circumbinary disk , this mass exchange could also affect the evolution and structure of circumblack - hole disks .",
    "this effect can not be treated in our simulations , however , because of the lack of sufficient resolution in the narrow region around the effective l1 point .",
    "the right - upper ( lower ) panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : opd_m1m2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : uneq ] , also demonstrate that the mass - capture rate is about one - order of magnitude as low as the mass - input rate in all the models .",
    "in fact , the total mass of circumblack - hole disks , which approximately equals to the total mass captured by black holes @xmath96 , is much lower than the mass of circumbinary disk , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdotevo ] .",
    "this strongly suggests that the circumblack - hole disk has a significantly low density .",
    "thus , we expect that the accretion flow should become radiatively inefficient in the vicinity of black holes @xcite .",
    "we address a question ; what happens if the circumbinary disk is inclined from the orbital plane of the supermassive bbhs ?",
    "the mass - capture rate profile may show a two - peaked feature , because there are a couple of points in the disk - inner edge to which the bbhs approach during one orbital period .",
    "in fact , the double - peak structure is observed in the optical outbursts of oj287 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the inclination angle on the mass - capture rate profile will be also examined in a subsequent paper .",
    "@xcite asserted that the mass supply rate from the circumbinary disk to the bbhs exhibits a quasi - periodic modulation due to the eccentricity of the circumbinary disk , even if the binary black hole has circular orbit .",
    "the disk eccentricity is excited due to the resonance interaction between the circumbinary disk and the central binary after a few viscous time - scale of the circumbinary disk .",
    "such a long - term evolution of the circumbinary disk could also give the time variations of the light curve of circumbinary disk itself , such as a superhump phenomenon in dwarf novae systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the circumbinary disk evolution could play a key role to resolve the loss - cone problem ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the disk - binary interaction gives an influence on the global evolution of the binary orbital elements , e.g. , the eccentricity .",
    "the semi - major axis , the mass - ratio , the inclination angle and so on @xcite . in the framework of the disk - binary interaction , therefore , the effects of all the orbital elements should ideally be taken account of .",
    "in addition , it is an open problem how the gas is supplied from an outer region over several parsec to an inner , subparsec region , in the context of the supermassive bbh systems in merged galactic nuclei .",
    "the mass supply to the circumbinary disk may prevent the accretion rate from decreasing due to the viscous diffusion of the surface density .",
    "although this viscous diffusion could be neglected in such a short - term evolution as our simulations , it should be taken account of in the mass inflow processes in the long - term evolution of the circumbinary disk over the viscous time - scale .",
    "the long - term evolution of the circumbinary disk remains as a matter to be discussed further .",
    "another important issue to be considered is a possible formation of shock structure .",
    "we measured the radial velocity at the inner boundary @xmath65 in model  2 and plot its orbital - phase dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrvff ] . here ,",
    "the radial velocity is normalized by the free - fall velocity .",
    "we understand that the radial velocity is on the same order of magnitude of the free - fall velocity and that it suffers the orbital modulation with the peak being around the apastron ( phase 0.5 ) .",
    "this trend contrasts with that of the mass - capture rate which exhibits a peak around the periastron ( see fig . [",
    "fig : opd_m1m2 ] ) .",
    "if the material infalls near circumblack - hole disk , shock structures could be formed near the outer edge of the circumblack - hole disks .",
    "substantial fraction of the kinetic energy of the material will be converted to the thermal energy .",
    "consequently , detectable soft x - rays or uv could be periodically emitted from the shock structures .",
    "such x - rays or uv will exhibit a broad peak around phase @xmath97 , whereas optical / ir radiation will show a sharp peak around phase @xmath98 0.0 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)kh28.eps      @xcite firstly proposed that the periodic behavior of the optical light - curve of oj287 may be induced by the orbital motion of the binary black holes , that is , the tidal perturbation of the secondary black hole causes the accretion rate of the primary black hole to be enhanced .",
    "although a number of models has been proposed during the last two decades since then @xcite , no widely accepted mechanism has been yet proposed for the behavior of periodic outbursts in oj287 .",
    "furthermore , several quasars are known often to show periodic outbursts similar to those in oj287 .",
    "the existence of supermassive bbhs has been also suggested for these sources , for example , 3c75 @xcite , 3c279 @xcite , pks 0420 - 014 @xcite and 3c345 @xcite . such periodic behaviors in the observed light curves of these sources could be also explained by our scenario i.e. , the outbursts are driven by the orbital eccentricity of bbhs in three - disk systems , as shown in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : opd_m1m2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : uneq ] .",
    "multiwavelength long - term monitoring observations should be a powerful tool to probe the existence of the circumblack - hole disks , as well as that of supermassive bbhs .",
    "as described in section  [ subsec : cbhdisks ] , the photons emerging from the inner region of the disk exhibits different seds and time variations from those emerging from the outer region . in addition , it is expected that the shock - induced radiation should also show periodic variations at different phases from those of seds , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrvff ] .",
    "if we detect periodic time variations of seds with the different behavior at different wavelengths , it provides the strong observational evidence for the existence of supermassive bbhs in three - disk systems on a parsec / subparsec scale of the galactic center .",
    "finally , we give a remark on the quasi - periodicities in the light curves .",
    "these are often found in the blazar light curves ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note that @xcite have found quasi - periodic light variations through the analysis of x - ray intensity variations from cygnus x-1 .",
    "it is well known that its x - ray curves are composed of numerous shots ( or mini - flares ) with a variety of flare amplitudes . by picking up only large shots they found that the light variations follow log - normal distribution .",
    "that is , if only large flaring events in the accretion flow produce blob outflow in the form of a jet , jet light curves will be quasi - periodic .",
    "this gives another possibility to produce quasi - periodicities in blazar light curves .",
    "much more work is desirable both theoretically and observationally in this area .",
    "for the purpose of providing the observable diagnosis to probe the existence of supermassive bbhs on a subparsec scale in merged galactic nuclei , we have carried out the sph simulations of accretion flows from circumbinary disks onto the supermassive bbhs .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "there are two - stage mechanisms to cause an accretion flow from the circumbinary disk onto the supermassive bbhs : first , the gas is guided to the two closest points on the circumbinary disk from the black holes by the tidal deformation of the circumbinary disk .",
    "then , the gas is increasingly accumulated on these two points by the gravitational attraction of the black holes .",
    "second , when the gas can pass across the maximum loci of the binary potential , the gas overflows via these two points and inspirals onto the black holes with the nearly free - fall velocity 2 .   in circular binaries , the gas continues to be supplied from the circumbinary disk onto the supermassive bbhs ( i.e. the gap is always closed ) .",
    "3 .   in eccentric binaries , the material supply undergoes the periodic on / off transitions with an orbital period because of the periodic variations of the binary potential .",
    "while the mass - capture rates exhibit little orbital - phase dependence in circular binaries , they significantly modulate with the orbital phase due to the gap opening / closing cycles , in eccentric binaries .",
    "this could provide the observable diagnosis for the presence of supermassive bbhs in three - disk systems at the galactic center .",
    "the circumblack - hole disks are formed around each black hole regardless of the orbital eccentricity and the mass ratio .",

    "<S> we study the accretion flows from the circumbinary disks onto the supermassive binary black holes in a subparsec scale of the galactic center , using a smoothed particles hydrodynamics ( sph ) code . </S>",
    "<S> simulation models are presented in four cases of a circular binary with equal and unequal masses , and of an eccentric binary with equal and unequal masses . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the circumblack - hole disks are formed around each black holes regardless of simulation parameters . </S>",
    "<S> there are two - step mechanisms to cause an accretion flow from the circumbinary disk onto supermassive binary black holes : first , the tidally induced elongation of the circumbinary disk triggers mass inflow towards two closest points on the circumbinary disk from the black holes . </S>",
    "<S> then , the gas is increasingly accumulated on these two points owing to the gravitational attraction of black holes . </S>",
    "<S> second , when the gas can pass across the maximum loci of the effective binary potential , it starts to overflow via their two points and freely infalls to each black hole . in circular binaries , the gas continues to be supplied from the circumbinary disk ( i.e. the gap between the circumbinary disk and the binary black hole is always closed . ) in eccentric binaries , the mass supply undergoes the periodic on / off transitions during one orbital period because of the variation of periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the gap starts to close after the apastron and to open again after the next periastron passage . due to this </S>",
    "<S> gap closing / opening cycles , the mass - capture rates are eventually strongly phase dependent . </S>",
    "<S> this could provide observable diagnosis for the presence of supermassive binary black holes in merged galactic nuclei . </S>"
