    "these experimental and theoretical results suggest that @xmath1-i@xmath3 is situated not so far away from the charge - ordering point . in case that spin fluctuations develop toward an antiferromagnetic ordering , the korringa ratio @xmath69 should be temperature sensitive , reflecting the preferential development of antiferromagnetic fluctuations with a well - defined wave vector @xmath87 relative to the @xmath87 = 0 ( ferromagnetic ) fluctuation .",
    "if the charge sector is also fluctuating , however , spin fluctuations should be spread in @xmath87 and may be only moderately reflected in @xmath69 .",
    "we performed @xmath0c - nmr measurements for a single crystal of @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 at ambient pressure to probe microscopically the nature of the metallic state , which is a rare case in the @xmath1-type family of compounds .",
    "the orientation dependence of the nmr spectra revealed that the lattice symmetry can be practically understood by the orthorhombic symmetry with a homogeneous molecular arrangement .",
    "the nmr shift and relaxation rate @xmath6 measurements showed the korringa relation up to room temperature with the weakly temperature - dependent korringa ratio @xmath69 (= 2  3 ) , which indicates that @xmath1-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2i@xmath3 is in a moderately correlated regime .",
    "however , the enhancement of relaxation rate , observed above @xmath8 200k , is a possible signature of the quantum critical charge fluctuations as suggested by a recent theoretical study .",
