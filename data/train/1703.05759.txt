    "phase i , now completed , has shown the feasibility of this technique using @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "phase ii , which uses a cylindrical waveguide and a cell compatible with tritium , is underway . by increasing the volume by more than one order of magnitude",
    ", phase iii targets a neutrino mass sensitivity comparable to current limits from the mainz and troitsk experiments @xcite : @xmath3 @xcite . using an atomic tritium source and a even larger fiducial volume",
    ", phase iv aims at a 40-mev sensitvity to the neutrino mass .",
    "one can achieve phase iii sensitivity after one year of data taking with a @xmath4 volume of tritium gas at a density of @xmath5 molecules per @xmath6 and a trapping efficiency of @xmath7 .",
    "in such an increased volume , the cyclotron radiation of beta decay electrons is essentially emitted into free space .",
    "the radiation can be collected using a ring - shaped array of antennas .",

    "each signal is then digitalized using a roach2 daq system .",
    "the 60 signals are sent to a gpu computing server which will handle the digital phase shifting and the channel summation .",
