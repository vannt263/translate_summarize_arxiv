    "the behavior of an excess eletron in a wide variety of fluids has been an interesting topic for many years @xcitein the gas phase or the dilute liquid phase , the electron behaves almost like a free particle . as the solvent density increases , the electron exihibits different properties depending upon the nature of the solvent and electron - solvent interactions . at liquid density ,",
    "the electron may become self - trapped in a cavity of solvent particles or remain _ quasifree _ depending upon the nature of electron - solvent interaction . observed properties such as the electron mobility@xcite and the absorption spectra @xcite probe the nature of the electronic states in the fluid and phenomena of localization@xcite .",
    "there are a broad range of problems in condensed matter physics that are intimately related to the problem of excess electrons in deformable medium .",
    "these include charge transfer kinetics in biological reactions , metal - insulator transitions in fluids , polarons , phonon - assisted hopping of charge carriers in semiconductors and insulators , quantum - tunneling , etc .",
    "while the excess electron problem belongs to the general problem of electrons in disordered materials , the liquid environment is in many ways different from the solid medium . in liquids ,",
    "the constituent particles can diffuse , and local environment around the solute electron can be substantially different from that in solid .",
    "when an electron is solvated in a polar liquid such as water or ammonia , the strong anisotropic electron - solvent interaction causes significant local modification of the equilibrium fluid structure @xcite .",
    "the electron becomes localized in a small cavity because molecules in a solvation shell orient to create a potential minimum .",
    "even simple fluids are found to exhibit electron mobilities that change by many orders of magnitude as the density of the fluid is altered slightly . in super critical helium , for example , the electron mobility drops by over 4 orders of magnitude as fluid density increased by a factor of 2 in low density regime@xcite .",
    "the reason for this behavior is strong repulsion between electron and solvent atom .",
    "this causes the the depletion of the solvent atoms from the region of the electron and forms a highly localized state of the electron .    in many other nonpolar fluids such as ar , ch@xmath1 , etc .",
    "the electron always remains in a state of high mobility@xcite comparable to many semiconducting materials .",
    "an interesting density dependence of the mobility has been observed in them .",
    "it shows a minimum near critical fluid density and a maximum at liquid density .",
    "electronic states in reduced dimension are of considerable interest . for example , for a system",
    "less than two spatial dimension , electrons are localized with an infinitesimal amount of disorder @xcite .",
    "the interest in problems of electron or phonon propagation in a one dimensional random potential stems from the discovery and extensive experimental study of a certain class of organic or metallo - organic materials @xcite .",
    "these matarials exhibit strongly anisotropic , quasi - one - dimensional behavior attributed to the fact that they consist of long chains , weakly interacting with each other . in many of these ,",
    "the presense of a random potential has been proposed in order to explain their behavior .",
    "electronic surface states play an important role in a wide variety of physical problems .",
    "for example , surface electrons on liquid helium has shown many interesting properties and led to important theoretical advances such as the spectrum of bound electronic states , electron transport on the he surface , effects due to deformation of the he surface , and the possibility that the electrons may form a two - dimensional crystal@xcite in the field of low - dimensionality physics .",
    "the theory for the excess electrons in fluids developed by chandler , singh , and richardson@xcite ( csr ) is based on the path integral formulation of quantum theory which maps the behavior of the electron on to that of a classical isomorphic polymer@xcite .",
    "the solvent - induced potential surface for the self - interaction of the isomorphic polymer is evaluated using an integral equation ( e.g. , reference interaction site model ) . with known potential surface",
    ", the polymer statistics is solved using variational approach@xcite that allows the determination of electronic properties and the structure of the liquid near the electron .",
    "the input of the theory is the pure solvent structure factor and the electron - solvent particle interaction potential .",
    "the csr theory in its formulation is applicable to an adiabatic solvent ( _ i.e. , solvent particles are treated classically _ ) , but has been extended to treat the effect of the quantum mechanical charge density fluctuation in the solvent particles @xcite .",
    "the calculated electron - absorption line shape and mobility are in good agreement with the simulations@xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "the predictions of csr theory were verified by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "for a one - dimensional system we @xcite have shown recently that the repulsive and attractive parts of electron - solvent interaction potential lead separately to localization of electron , respectively , by creating cavity or forming a cluster of the fluids atoms around it . in two dimensional system",
    "we @xcite have shown that dispersion of the wavepacket associated with the solvated electron is very sensitive to the interaction between the electron and the fluid atoms , and exhibits complicated behavior in its density dependence .",
    "csr theory has been extended to calculate the effective mass @xcite as well as the density matrix of the excess electron in fluid @xcite .",
    "the csr theory involves three or more characteristic lengths , depending upon the nature of electron - solvent interaction .",
    "these lengths are the thermal wavelength of excess electron @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the inverse of temperature in the unit of the boltzmann constant @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the mass of a bare electron , and @xmath6 is the planck s constant divided by 2@xmath7 ) , characteristic length associated with the electron - solvent pseudopotential , and a length associated with the mean volume occupied by each solvent atom , which is related to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 being the number density of the solvent and @xmath10 is the diameter of the solvent atom , and @xmath11 is the spatial dimensionality of the system .",
    "the behavior of the excess electron is expected to depend sensitively on these lengths .",
    "laria and chandler @xcite have attempted to explain the contrasting behaviors of the electron in super critical helium and xenon on the basis of different ranges of the electron - solvent repulsive interactions .    in the present work we examine in detail the role played by different lengths and the spatial dimensionality of the system ( in which we have considered the same solvent - solvent and electron - solvent model potential ) to study the self - trapping behavior of the electron .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the csr theory . in sec .",
    "iii we have presented the results and their discussions . finally , section iv presents concluding remarks .",
    "appendix a provide some mathematical material for @xmath11- dimensional integration",
    "the system we consider is a single electron dissolved in a single component classical solvent . in the csr theory ,",
    "an excess electron is mapped , using a discretized version of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics , onto a polymer of p interaction sites or beads . under this isomorphism @xcite",
    ", the electron can be viewed as a classical ring polymer .",
    "the total potential energy can be written as @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 here , * r * denotes the position of the excess electron , @xmath15 is the collection of the coordinates for a solvent atom , and n is the number of solvent atoms and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , respectively , electron - solvent atom and solvent atom - solvent atom interaction potentian .",
    "we consider a @xmath11-dimensional system of spheres of diameter @xmath10 in which the pair interaction between the solvent atoms is taken to be @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath11-dimensional distance ( for notational convenience the @xmath11 dependence will not always be explicitly indicated ) .",
    "the electron - solvent atom interaction in a real system consists of a strong repulsion at short distance due to orthogonality requirements between wavefunctions of core electrons in the solvent particle and that of the excess electron and attraction at large distances due to dispersion interaction .",
    "however , in a system of neutral atoms the electronic states are determined primarily by the short range repulsive interaction or excluded - volume effect .",

    "[ see fig .",
    "( 1c ) ] the repulsive interaction is not strong enough ( because @xmath98 ) to localize the electron due to ordered structure formed when the solvent density is high . when the attractive interaction between electron and solvent atom is large ( @xmath99 ) , the reduced correlation length of the electron is very small at very low solvent density and it stays almost constant upto @xmath100 .",
    "this behavior strongly indicates the electron is localized to a single atom irrespective of space dimensionality .",
    "as the space dimensionality increases , the range of the constant value of the solvent density decreases for example for @xmath11=1 , _ s _ is constant upto @xmath101 . one interesting feature we have noted from figs .",
    "1a , 1b , and 1c is that as the attractive interaction increases , the reduced correlation length of the electron decreases as we increase the solvent density in the low - density regime , but the correlation turns upwardto have a maximum in the middle density regime , and finally the electron is trapped in the high density regime .",
    "if we carefully look at figs.1 , we observe that as we increase the space dimensionality , we find these effect are pronounsed for large attractive interaction .",
    "the similar type of behavior has been observed for the other values of @xmath95 .",
    "when @xmath95 is less than @xmath102 we found the reduced correlation length of the electron decreases as we increase the attractive interaction _ i.e. _ @xmath103 and is self trapped at lower density .",
    "opposite trend is found for increasing @xmath95 .    from figs .",
    "1[a ] , 1[b ] and 1[c ] it is clear that at the begining when we start increasing the attractive interaction ( @xmath104 ) the wave packet associated with the electron increases then further increase of electron solvent attractive interaction i.e. when @xmath105 the electron is localized on a single solvent atom .",
    "the reason behind the delocalized state at small vales of attractive interaction ( @xmath96 ) is the cancellation between the repulsive and attractive electron - solvent interaction . in fig .",
    "2[a ] to fig.2[f ] we plot the electron - solvent radial distribution function for one , two and three dimension at various solvent density and attractive iteraction ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "2 can be explained in consistent manner with the same physical picture given for figs . [ 1 ] .",
    "when the attractive interaction is weak , the electron pushes the solvent atoms makes space to self - trap .",
    "when the attractive interaction is very large ( @xmath106 ) the electron is trapped on a single atom irrespective of space dimensionality , as evidenced by a large peak in @xmath78 [ see figs .",

    "this competition between vaious length scales probably make the sharp transition around @xmath110 .    in fig .",

    "cage effect_. in the case of electron in helium and xenon , the self - trapping of electron in helium and delocalized state of the electron in xenon has been explained on the basis of @xmath95 value @xcite when elecron - solvent interaction is repulsive _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath112 .",
    "the csr theory for the excess electrons in simple fluid ( consisting of spherical atoms ) has been studied in one , two , and three dimension .",
    "the detailed study led us to the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the reduced correlation length , _ s _ , is very sensitive to the nature of the electron - fluid atom interaction , thermal wavelength of the excess electron ( @xmath0 ) and a length associated with the mean volume occupied by each fluid atom which is related to @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , @xmath115 being the number density of the fluid atoms and @xmath10 is the effective diameter of a fluid atom .",
    "the behavior is interpreted in terms of an interplay among the length scales noted above .",
    "when the electron - solvent attractive interaction is very large , the density dependence of the size of the electron polymer relative to the free particle is dominated essentially by the pair attractive interaction , and the electron is trapped in a single solvent atom irrespective of the dimensionality ( @xmath11 ) . on the contrary , if the attractive interaction is absent , the electron is trapped in a cage formed by the solvent atoms at higher density . when the attractive interaction is low ( @xmath116 ) due to cancellation between repulsive and attractive interaction ,",
    "the electron is delocalized irrespective of the dimensionality .",
    "2 .   in the one dimensional case",
    "the reduced correlation length is almost independent of @xmath95 when electron - solvent attractive interaction is absent . on the other hand , in two and three dimensions , @xmath117 ,",
    "the reduced correlation length of the electron is sensitive on the value of the @xmath95 .",
    "3 .   in three dimension we found when @xmath98 and @xmath118 , the temperature dependence of the reduced correlation length , @xmath117 , shows a sharp transition ( metal - insulator type ) around @xmath119 at @xmath109 .",
    "4 .   the long range electron - solvent attraction dominates at low density , while hard core repulsion dominates at high densities .",
    "when both interactions are present , they can counterbalance each other .",
    "consequently , at some intermediate density , the effective electron - solvent interaction can be quite small , resulting in the electron delocalization .    in the present work we have explored the electron self - trapping in simple liquid for various space dimension ( @xmath11= 1,2 , and 3 ) which have same model potential ( solvent - solvent interaction potential and electron - solvent interation potential ) in every space dimension . in every space dimension ( i.e. @xmath11=1 , 2 , and 3 )",
