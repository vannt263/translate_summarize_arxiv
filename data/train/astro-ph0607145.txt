    "a tight neutron - star binary loses orbital momentum via gravitational radiation and eventually merges , forming a black hole and a transient debris disk with a huge accretion rate , comparable to @xmath13  @xmath1 ( see e.g. ruffert et al .",
    "1997 for numerical simulations ) .",
    "a similar accretion disk may form inside a collapsing massive star , so called `` collapsar '' ( woosley 1993 ; see mcfadyen & woosley 1999 for numerical simulations ) . in this case the central parts of the stellar core quickly form a black hole of mass @xmath14 that grows through accretion on the core - collapse timescale @xmath15  s. if the core material has specific angular momentum substantially above @xmath16 an accretion disk forms with @xmath17  @xmath1 .",
    "accretion disks are known to be efficient producers of relativistic jets in various sources associated with black holes , including x - ray binaries and quasars .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the hyper - accreting disks in neutron - star mergers and collapsars produce relativistic jets as well .",
    "because of the huge accretion rate , the power of such jets may be enormous .",
    "if a fraction @xmath18 of the accretion power @xmath19 is channelled to a jet , it will create an explosion with energy @xmath20  erg where @xmath21 is the mass accreted through the disk .",
    "hyper - accreting disk therefore provides a plausible mechanism for powerful relativistic explosions observed as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs , see piran 2004 for a review ) .",
    "accretion in the disk is driven by viscous stress @xmath22 that may be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is pressure inside the disk and @xmath25 is a dimensionless parameter ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "viscous stress is created by magnetic fields that are amplified as a result of magneto - rotational instability .",
    "numerical simulations of this instability show that @xmath26 ( see balbus & hawley 1998 for a review ) . in this respect ,",
    "the hyper - accreting disk is expected to be similar to normal accretion disks in x - ray binaries .",
    "it is , however , crucially different as regards microphysics of the accreting matter and its cooling .",
    "the optical depth to photon scattering is enormous and radiation can not escape ; it is advected by the matter flow into the black hole ( or outward by the jet ) .",
    "the only possible cooling mechanism is neutrino emission .",
    "significant neutrino losses occur at high @xmath27  s@xmath28 , and then almost all the accretion energy is carried away by neutrinos .",
    "in any realistic scenario , the black hole has a significant spin as it forms from rotating matter and further spun up by accretion .",
    "the spin is likely to help the jet formation through , e.g. blandford - znajek process .",
    "it also increases the overall efficiency of accretion from 6% ( zero spin @xmath29 ) up to 42% ( maximum spin @xmath30 ) .",
    "the black - hole spin has significant effects on the accretion disk because it changes dramatically the spacetime metric near the black hole , where most of accretion power is released .",
    "for example , in the extreme case of @xmath30 , the inner radius of the disk is reduced by a factor of 6 compared with the schwarzschild case .",
    "this leads to a higher temperature and a much higher neutrino intensity .",
    "therefore , disks around rapidly spinning black holes may create powerful jets via neutrino annihilation above the disk .",
    "the structure of neutrino - cooled disks was investigated in a number of works , and one of them studied accretion onto a spinning kerr black hole ( popham , woosley , & fryer 1999 , hereafter pwf ) .",
    "pwf used accurate equations of relativistic hydrodynamics in kerr spacetime , however , made simplifying assumptions about the state of accreting matter and its neutrino emission , which later turned out invalid : ( 1 ) electron degeneracy was neglected .",
    "the true degeneracy is significant : it strongly suppresses the @xmath31 population , changes the equation of state and neutrino emissivity .",
    "( 2 ) neutron - to - proton ratio was not calculated and no distinction was made between neutrons and protons in the calculation of neutrino emissivity .",
    "the correct ratio is typically @xmath32 , which leads to a strong suppression of neutrino emission .",
    "( 3 ) the produced neutrinos were assumed to escape freely . in the case of a kerr black hole ,",
    "this assumption breaks at @xmath33  s@xmath28  then the disk is opaque for neutrinos in the inner region where most of accretion power is released .",
    "recent works discussed one or several of these issues .",
    "for example , di matteo , perna , & narayan ( 2002 ) focused on the effects of neutrino opacity at high @xmath2 , however neglected degeneracy and assumed @xmath34 .",
    "kohri & mineshige ( 2002 ) studied strongly degenerate disks , and kohri , narayan , & piran ( 2005 )  the realistic midly degenerate disks .",
    "none of these works , however , attempted the construction of an accretion model in kerr spacetime  all assumed a non - rotating black hole and used a newtonian or pseudo - newtonian approximation .",
    "pruet , woosley , & hoffman ( 2003 ) studied the kerr disk models of pwf and pointed out that the disk must be neutron rich in the inner region , however did not attempt to model self - consistently the disk structure .",
    "beloborodov ( 2003a ) showed that @xmath35-equilibrium is established in disks with @xmath36  g  s@xmath28 , where @xmath37 is the black hole mass .",
    "the relation between temperature , density , and neutron richness in equilibrium was studied in that work , and the disk was shown to become neutron rich in the inner region if @xmath38  g  s@xmath28 .",
    "the structure of the disk was not , however , calculated .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a self - consistent , fully relativistic model of accretion disks around kerr black holes .",
    "our study is limited to steady accretion with constant @xmath2 , which is a good approximation at radii where the accretion timescale is shorter than the evolution timescale of the disk ( it may be @xmath39  s , depending on the concrete scenario of disk formation ) .",
    "the accretion rate is assumed to be constant with radius , @xmath40 , neglecting the fraction of @xmath2 that may be lost to a jet .",
    "the model employs the customary approximation of one - dimensional hydrodynamics ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) where the effects of three - dimensional mhd turbulence are described by one viscosity parameter @xmath7 .    in ",
    "2 we summarize the physics of neutrino - cooled disks , write down the set of relevant equations , and point out where progress is made compared with the previous works .",
    "we pay particular attention to the mechanism of cooling that couples to and regulates the state of accreting matter .",
    "the method of solution of the disk equations is described in   3 , and",
    "the results are presented in   4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in   5 .",
    "generally , the size of accretion disk is limited by the maximum angular momentum of the flow .",
    "we here consider only the region where accretion is quasi - steady , i.e. the accretion timescale is smaller than the evolution timescale of @xmath2 .",
    "this sets an effective outer boundary @xmath41 which depends on the specific scenario of disk formation . in our models , we choose @xmath41 sufficiently far ( well outside the neutrino ignition radius ) to cover the whole neutrino - cooled region .",
    "neutrino cooling is negligible outside the ignition radius @xmath4 and the viscously dissipated energy is stored in the accretion flow , which makes the disk thick in the outer region .",
    "we choose the disk temperature at @xmath41 so that the energy content per baryon approximately equals virial energy @xmath42 as is generally the case in any advective flow ( e.g. narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "the flow is assumed to be initially made of alpha particles at the outer boundary .",
    "the calculations will show that the flow completely forgets the boundary conditions as it approaches the ignition radius : @xmath7-particles are decomposed into free nucleons , and entropy per baryon and lepton number are regulated to certain values by neutrino emission .",
    "this convergence makes the details of advective accretion in the outer region unimportant .",
    "note also that the thick disk in the outer advective region @xmath43 may produce a strong outflow , so that the accretion rate @xmath2 decreases with radius . however , even this fact is not so important as long as we are given @xmath2 at @xmath44 where the disk becomes relatively thin and @xmath2 remains constant .",
    "the disk is described by vertically averaged quantities such as density @xmath45 , temperature @xmath46 , pressure @xmath47 , energy density @xmath48 , electron chemical potential @xmath49 , neutrino chemical potential @xmath50 , etc .",
    "the disk is axially symmetric and steady , so all quantities depend of radius @xmath51 only and we deal with a one - dimensional problem . the difference between radius in cylindrical and spherical coordinates",
    "is neglected as if the disk were geometrically thin .",
    "this difference is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is half - thickness of the disk at radius @xmath51 .",
    "the thin - disk approximation is quite accurate inside the ignition radius where @xmath54 , and less accurate at @xmath43 where @xmath55 .",
    "the vertically - averaged model is designed to describe most of the disk material , and it may not describe well the `` skin '' of the disk , especially if viscous heating is not uniform in the vertical direction .",
    "the vertical structure of the disk is governed by the unknown vertical distribution of heating and the vertical neutrino transport ( sawyer 2003 ) .",
    "we do not study the vertical structure in this paper and use the simple `` one - zone '' approximation of the vertically - averaged disk .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of a relativistic disk express conservation of baryon number , energy , and momentum ( angular and radial ) in kerr spacetime ( see beloborodov 1999 for a review ) .",
    "hereafter we use boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath56 with the corresponding kerr metric @xmath57 , which has two parameters : the black hole mass @xmath37 and its dimensionless spin parameter @xmath58 ( see e.g. misner , thorne , & wheeler 1973 ) .",
    "the disk is in the equatorial plane @xmath59 and the fluid motion is described by the four - velocity @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the proper time of the fluid .",
    "the equation of baryon conservation reads [ eq : baryon ] u^r=- , where the half thickness @xmath62 is to be determined below by the equation of hydrostatic balance .",
    "the exact differential equations of azimuthal and radial motion may be replaced by much simpler and sufficiently accurate conditions following shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) and page & thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "this `` thin - disk '' approximation neglects terms @xmath63 and assumes that the fluid is in keplerian rotation with angular velocity , [ eq : omega ] = = _ k = ^-1 .",
    "a small radial velocity is superimposed on this rotation , [ eq : ur ] u^r =- c_s ( ) , where @xmath64 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath65 is a numerical factor .",
    "this factor is determined by the inner boundary condition ( zero torque at the last stable orbit @xmath66 ) and the kerr metric ; it is calculated in appendix  a. the accuracy of the thin - disk approximation is not perfect at large radii @xmath43 , where the disk is thick . however , the details of the outer region have no effect on the solution for the neutrino - cooled disk .",
    "the equation of energy conservation reads [ eq : energy ] f^+-f^- = u^r , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the rates of viscous heating and cooling per unit area of the disk , as measured by the local observer corotating with the disk .",
    "@xmath68 depends on the state of the disk matter that will be discussed in   2.3 below .",
    "@xmath67 may be expressed in terms of @xmath69 and the kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath9 , [ eq : fplus ] f^+=h(u+p ) g^rrg_(-g^tt)^4 ( ) ^2 , where @xmath70 is the lorentz factor of fluid measured in the frame of a local observer with zero angular momentum .",
    "the viscosity coefficient is related to the disk thickness @xmath62 , sound speed @xmath71 , and @xmath7 by @xmath72 .",
    "the model described by equations  ( [ eq : omega ] ) , ( [ eq : ur ] ) , and ( [ ( ] [ eq : energy ] ) neglects the effect of the stored energy and pressure on the radial and azimuthal dynamics of the disk , and retains the advected energy in the energy balance .",
    "this approximation is reasonable as may be seen from exact hydrodynamical models : the deviation from keplerian rotation remains small ( @xmath73% ) even when the advection effect dominates in the energy balance ( beloborodov 1998 ) .",
    "below @xmath74 may occur in the limit of a large disk with no cooling .",
    "this limit does not apply to grb disks .",
    "] then the main effect of advection is the simple storage of energy that is not radiated away ( @xmath75 in eq .",
    "[ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "it strongly influences pressure and the scale - height of the disk , and hence changes @xmath76 according to equation  ( [ eq : ur ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : omega ] ) and ( [ eq : ur ] ) remain , however , good approximations .",
    "the vertical balance is given by @xmath77 where j= is the relativistic correction to the tidal force in the kerr metric , and r_g=.    in contrast to accretion disks in x - ray binaries and agn , there is one more conservation law that must be taken into account in grb disks . the lepton number ( or , equivalently , the proton - to - baryon ratio @xmath5 ) may change with radius because the neutrino and anti - neutrino fluxes from the disk may not be equal .",
    "the conservation of lepton number is expressed by the equation , [ eq : ye ] ( n_|-n _ ) = u^r , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the number fluxes of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos per unit area ( from one face of the disk ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the number densities of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos inside the disk ; they become significant when the disk is opaque ( see   2.4 below ) .",
    "@xmath5 is related to the neutron - to - proton ratio by @xmath82 .",
    "the disk is made of neutrons , protons , @xmath7-particles , electrons , positrons , photons , neutrinos , and anti - neutrinos .",
    "the effect of magnetic field on the particle distribution functions may be neglected ( see beloborodov 2003a ) . the total pressure and energy density",
    "are given by [ eq : p ] p = p_b+p_+p_e^-+p_e^++p_+p_| , [ eq : u ] u = u_b+u_+u_e^-+u_e^++u_+u_| . here , the baryon pressure and energy density are p_b = k_bt(x_f+ ) , u_b = p_b , where @xmath83 is the mass fraction of free nucleons and @xmath84 is the mass fraction of @xmath7-particles .",
    "@xmath83 is found from the equation of nuclear statistical equilibrium ( see e.g. meyer 1994 ) , 4.910 ^ 2_10 ^ -3/2t_10 ^ 9/4 ( -)= 4 ( 1-x_f)^-1/2 , where @xmath85  g  @xmath86 and @xmath87  k.    the radiation pressure and energy density are p_= , u_=3p _ , where @xmath88  erg  cm  @xmath89  k@xmath90 is the radiation constant .",
    "electrons are neither non - degenerate nor strongly degenerate , and they are not ultra - relativistic at all radii . therefore , no asymptotic expansions are valid , and the thermodynamics quantities for @xmath31 must be calculated using the exact fermi - dirac distribution .",

    "this cooling is dominant in an extended region around @xmath110 where @xmath7-particles gradually disintegrate ( see   4 below ) .",
    "the terms @xmath111 and @xmath112 represent the cooling due to emission of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "there are four different channels of neutrino emission ( see e.g. kohri & mineshige 2002 ) : ( 1 ) electron capture onto protons @xmath113 and positron capture onto neutrons @xmath114 , ( 2 ) pair annihilation @xmath115 , ( 3 ) nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung @xmath116 , and ( 4 ) plasmon decay @xmath117 .",
    "the @xmath31 capture strongly dominates neutrino emission in grb disks , and the other three channels may be safely neglected .",
    "the @xmath31 annihilation into @xmath118 makes a small contribution even when electron degeneracy is neglected ( pwf ) .",
    "when degeneracy is taken into account , the positron population is suppressed and the reaction rate becomes completely negligible .",
    "bremsstrahlung and plasmon decay are important only at extremely high degeneracy and negligible in grb disks .",
    "we calculate below @xmath111 and @xmath112 due to the @xmath31 capture onto nucleons .",
    "this calculation is different in the transparent and opaque regions of the disk .",
    "if the disk is transparent to the emitted neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , the emerging neutrino flux equals the vertically integrated emissivity that is found , e.g. , in shapiro & teukolsky ( 1983 ) .",
    "this gives , [ eq : ftr ] f_=hy_ekm_e c^2 f(e+q,_e ) ( e+q)^2 [ 1-]^1/2 e^3 de , f_|=h(1-y_e)k m_e c^2 _ q+1^+ f(e - q,-_e ) ( e - q)^2 ^1/2 e^3 de .",

    "neutrinos relax to thermal equilibrium : a detailed balance is established between absorption and emission .",
    "then neutrinos are described by the fermi - dirac distribution , and the energy flux of escaping neutrinos may be written as [ eq : fop ] f_= , where [ eq : unu ] u_= m_e c^2 f(e , _ ) e^3 de is the energy density of thermalized neutrinos inside the disk and @xmath121 is the total optical depth seen by @xmath9 , including absorption and scattering ( the cross sections of relevant processes are given in appendix  b ) .",
    "the chemical potential of neutrinos @xmath122 that appears in equation  ( [ eq : unu ] ) is related to @xmath49 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 because the detailed equilibrium @xmath125 is established .",

    "finally , the number fluxes of @xmath9 and @xmath128 that escape the disk are given in the opaque regime by [ eq : dnop ] n_= , n_= f(e , _ ) e^2 de , n_|= , n_|= f(e,- _ ) e^2 de .",
    "two changes happen at the transition to the opaque regime : ( 1 ) the probability of direct neutrino escape is reduced as @xmath129 , and ( 2 ) neutrinos get thermalized .",
    "note that the rates of neutrino scattering and absorption are comparable , and a large optical depth @xmath130 implies that neutrinos are completely reabsorbed in the disk .",
    "the neutrino spectrum significantly changes at the transition : it is described by fermi - dirac distribution in the opaque region , with a non - zero chemical potential @xmath50 . in particular , the mean energy of neutrinos , @xmath131 , changes .",
    "we model the transition using the following approximate method .",
    "first we calculate the energy density of neutrinos that would be obtained in the transparent and opaque limits : @xmath132 from equation  ( [ eq : ftr ] ) and @xmath133 from equation (  [ eq : unu ] ) , and define the parameter x=. if the disk is transparent we must find @xmath134 ( no reabsorption ) and @xmath135 .",
    "if it is opaque , @xmath136 ( strong reabsorption ) and @xmath137 . in our calculations , the neutrino flux is approximated by f_=\\ {    ll c(1+_)^-1 & , + c(1+_)^-1 & .    .",
    "this expression is continuous at the transition point @xmath138 .    to model the change of @xmath139 at the transition we approximate the mean energy of the emitted neutrinos by |e_=(1-x)+x",
    "then we define _",
    "= , which smoothly changes across the transition and has the correct limits at @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "transition to the opaque region for anti - neutrinos is calculated in the same way .",
    "finally , we note that emission of muon and tau neutrinos is orders of magnitude weaker compared with the emission of electron neutrinos by @xmath31 capture reactions .",
    "the main emission mechanism of @xmath142 and @xmath143 is nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the corresponding emissivity when nucleons are non - degenerate ( @xmath144  g  s@xmath28 ) is given by ( thompson , burrows , & horvath 2000 ) _ _ _ 10 ^ 30_14 ^ 2 ( ) ^5.5 ^-3  s^-1 , where @xmath145 is a numerical factor . at high densities ,",

    "the muon - neutrino emissivity will be found to be well below @xmath148 and therefore may be neglected .",
    "recent works on neutrino - cooled disks assumed a schwarzschild black hole , and the main advantage of our model is that it is fully relativistic and describes accretion by kerr black holes .",
    "other advances compared with the most recent work by kohri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) inclusion of the zero - torque boundary condition at the last stable orbit .",
    "this has a strong effect on the heating rate @xmath67 and the radial velocity @xmath76 .",
    "the effect of inner boundary is described by the factor @xmath65 , which is much smaller than unity in the hottest region of the disk , @xmath149 .",
    "( 2 ) advection of heat and lepton number is treated accurately , using the differential equation of radial transport .",
    "this is essential since the disk is far from being self - similar and no analytical approximations are valid .",
    "the set of equations then becomes more complicated , however , it allows one to calculate the global model of the disk , from the outer advective region to the last stable orbit .",
    "( 3 ) the transition to the opaque region is treated accurately .",
    "we find that there is only one thermalized neutrino species ( electron neutrino ) , and its chemical potential @xmath50 is obtained from the detailed equilibrium rather than assumed to be zero .",
    "( 4 ) a corrected cross - section is used for anti - neutrino absorption by protons , which takes into account the proton recoil ( see appendix  b ) .",
    "this minor refinement is interesting only in high-@xmath2 disks that produce high - energy neutrinos .",
    "the disk is described by the set of coupled equations most of which are local , i.e. relate local parameters at a given radius .",
    "two equations , however , are differential ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : energy ] and [ eq : ye ] ) ; they state conservation of energy and lepton number and contain advection terms that describe radial transport of energy and @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore have to specify two boundary conditions .",
    "our outer boundary is outside the neutrino - cooled disk , in the advective region , where neutrino emission may be neglected and matter is dominated by @xmath7-particles .",
    "so , one of our boundary conditions is @xmath150 .    as the other boundary condition",
    "one may specify any parameter that gives a reasonable approximation to the advection - dominated solution ( narayan , piran , & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "for example , one could specify a certain value of @xmath151 that is characteristic for advective disks , and calculate all other parameters at @xmath41 using the local equations .",
    "there is a limited freedom in the choice of @xmath152 , which reflects physical uncertainties in the behavior of the disk outside our boundary @xmath41 : how far the disk extends beyond @xmath41 and how much mass and energy it has lost to a wind .",
    "these uncertainties , however , have no impact on the neutrino - cooled disk at @xmath153 as we verify directly by varying the outer boundary condition : the solution we get at @xmath154 is the same in all cases . instead of @xmath155 ,",
    "one may use energy per baryon @xmath156 as a free parameter at the outer boundary . in the advective disk",
    ", @xmath156 is comparable to the virial specific energy @xmath157 . in the sample models shown below we specify @xmath158 at @xmath159 .",
    "the set of disk equations is a complicated mixture of differential and algebraic equations , which involve integrals of the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "we solve these equations on a logarithmic grid @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) , starting at @xmath162 and moving inward . at each step , we need to find the parameters of the disk at @xmath163 using the known parameters at @xmath164 from the previous step .",
    "the state of matter at any radius is described by @xmath5 and two independent thermodynamic quantities , which we choose to be @xmath92 and @xmath165 ( because they enter as parameters in the integrals of fermi - dirac distribution ) .",
    "density @xmath45 , pressure @xmath47 , and energy density @xmath48 are expressed in terms of @xmath100 , @xmath98 , and @xmath5 as explained in   2.3 .",
    "for example , the expression for @xmath45 is given by the charge neutrality equation  ( [ eq : charge ] ) .",
    "the computational problem now reduces to finding @xmath100 , @xmath98 , and @xmath5 at radius @xmath160 given the known parameters at @xmath166 .",
    "@xmath167 is easily found using the differential equation  ( [ eq : ye ] ) since @xmath168 is known from the previous step .",
    "the main difficulty is in the calculation of @xmath169 and @xmath170 . as two independent equations for @xmath100 and @xmath98 we choose hydrostatic balance  ( [ eq : vb ] ) and energy equation  ( [ eq : energy ] ) .",

    "the model also assumes a steady state , which is applicable only to radii where accretion timescale is shorter than the timescale of variation of @xmath2 in the problem .",
    "the main advance of our work compared with pwf is the calculation of electron degeneracy and nuclear composition of the accreting matter ; both dramatically affect the disk and its neutrino emission .",

    "radial advection of lepton number @xmath5 and viscously dissipated heat is important outside the ignition radius @xmath4 .",

    "general properties of the @xmath9-cooled disk are as follows .",
    " the disk is relatively thin , @xmath237 , especially in the inner region where most of accretion energy is released .",
    "the outer advective region @xmath238 is also significantly cooled by the gradual disintegration of @xmath7-particles , and its thickness is reduced .",
    " the @xmath9-cooled disk is nearly in @xmath35-equilibrium , in agreement with analytical estimates ( beloborodov 2003a ) . in particular , the relation between @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath5 calculated under the equilibrium assumption ( fig .",
    "1 and 2 in beloborodov 2003a ) applies with a high accuracy .",
    " degeneracy of electrons in the disk significantly suppresses the positron density @xmath239 .",
    "however , the strong degeneracy limit is not applicable  the disk regulates itself to a mildly degenerate state .",
    "the reason of this regulation is the negative feedback of degeneracy on the cooling rate : higher degeneracy @xmath240 @xmath241 fewer electrons ( lower @xmath5 ) and positrons ( @xmath242 ) @xmath241 weaker neutrino emission @xmath241 lower cooling rate @xmath241 higher temperature @xmath241 lower degeneracy .",
    " pressure in @xmath9-cooled disks is dominated by baryons , @xmath243 , most of which are neutrons .",
    " all @xmath9-cooled disks are very neutron rich in the inner region , with @xmath12 or lower .",
    "the high neutron richness has important implications for the global picture of grb explosion ( e.g. derishev , kocharovsky , & kocharovsky 1999 ; beloborodov 2003a , b ; rossi , beloborodov , & rees 2006 ) . when the neutron - rich material is ejected in a relativistic jet , it develops a large lorentz factor , and the neutrons gradually decay on scales up to @xmath244  cm where the grb blast wave is observed .",
    "the disks around rapidly rotating black holes are markedly different from disks around schwarzschild black holes .",
    "they extend much closer to the center and reach higher temperatures and densities .",
    "for example , we found that the disk with @xmath174 around a kerr black hole with @xmath177 becomes opaque for neutrinos at @xmath245  s@xmath28 , which is 10 times lower than the corresponding @xmath225 for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "besides , kerr disks produce much higher neutrino fluxes in the inner region , with a higher mean energy per neutrino . the annihilation reaction @xmath246 deposits energy above the disk and can drive a powerful outflow that will be investigated elsewhere .",
