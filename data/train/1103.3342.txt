    "perovskite oxide is denoted as @xmath6o@xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent lanthanide ( and/or alkaline earth elements ) and transition - metal elements , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 ion is surrounded by six oxygen ions , and @xmath9o@xmath10 octahedron is formed .",
    "the octahedron mainly contributes electrical and magnetic proerties of the perovskite oxide . according to the ionic radius of @xmath8 ion , the bond angle @xmath11 @xmath9-o-@xmath9 deviates from 180@xmath12 , which causes a change of the bandwidth . in a substituted system of @xmath13@xmath14@xmath9o@xmath7 , the carrier concentration",
    "is also controlled as well as the bandwidth .",
    "the a - site ordered manganese oxide @xmath15bamn@xmath16o@xmath10 ( @xmath17 lanthanide ) has attracted much attention because of significant physical phenomena such as the large magnetoresistance of 1,000 % at room temperature @xcite , charge and orbital orderings at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "these properties attribute to a - site ordering working as `` a periodic '' coulomb potential which stabilizes charge , spin , and/or orbital orderings of the electrons on b - site @xcite . owing to the randomness , a - site disordered phase of @xmath18ba@xmath19mno@xmath7 displays the spin - glass state or the itinerant ferromagnetic state instead of the charge ordered state seen in the ordered phase @xcite .",
    "the a - site ordered cobalt oxide sr@xmath7yco@xmath20o@xmath21 also exhibits peculiar magnetic properties with a high ferromagnetic ( ferrimagnetic ) transition temperature of 335 k @xcite , which is in contrast with a spin state crossover near 100 k in lacoo@xmath7 @xcite . in this compound ,",
    "the a - site ordering stabilizes oxygen deficient ordering , which makes a volume of the coo@xmath10 octahedron larger than that of lacoo@xmath7 @xcite and gives a different coordination number of co@xmath5 from lacoo@xmath7 .",
    "these modifications stabilize high - spin and/or intermediate - spin states of co@xmath5 even at low temperatures , which causes the peculiar magnetic properties .",
    "hence , partial substitution for the a - site or b - site cations strongly affects the spin state leading to significant suppression of the magnetic order ; ca substitution for sr site @xcite and 6%-mn doping in the b site @xcite destroys the room - temperature ferromagnetism of sr@xmath7yco@xmath20o@xmath21 .",
    "recently , a new a - site ordered perovskite y@xmath22sr@xmath23mn@xmath16gao@xmath24 ( sr@xmath25y@xmath26 mn@xmath27ga@xmath28o@xmath29 ) was reported by gillie _",

    "they found an antiferromagnetic state below 100 k in this material showing that y@xmath22sr@xmath23mn@xmath16gao@xmath24 was a antiferromagnetic insulator , however , they did not report the transport properties .",

    "we have succeeded in preparing both a - site ordered and disordered phases for @xmath4 using different preparation conditions and observe a significant decrease of the resistivity in the disordered phase .",

    "lastly , we will discuss a difference of the transport and magnetic properties between the ordered ( o sample ) and disordered samples ( d sample ) .",
    "figure 6 ( a ) shows the temperature dependences of the resistivity of the o and d samples .",
    "the magnitude of the resistivity of the d sample is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the o sample , while the thermopower and magnetization of the d sample quite resemble those of the o sample as seen in fig .",
    "this strongly contrasts with the difference between the ferromagnetic - metal state of the disordered @xmath18ba@xmath19mno@xmath7 and charge - ordered insulating state of the ordered @xmath15bamn@xmath16o@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this variety of the properties comes from mn@xmath73 with the charge degree of freedom , while sr@xmath0ermn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 has mn@xmath5 without the charge degree of freedom causing the small difference between the properties .",
    "the difference of the resistivity shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) is explained by several possible origins as follows : ( 1 ) a decrease of the carrier concentration , ( 2 ) an increase of the scattering time , ( 3 ) a change of dimensionality in conduction and ( 4 ) a change of electronic structure induced by the disordering of a site . as seen in fig .",
    "6(b ) , two samples exhibit almost the same magnitude of the thermopower of @xmath74 @xmath75v / k .",
    "since thermopower is a function of carrier concentration , the result shows that carrier concentration does not differ so much in the two samples .",
    "in addition , since the content @xmath44 of ga ions which can be scattering centers is 1 in both samples , a possibility of ( 2 ) can be also denied . as stated in the introduction ,",
    "ga ion selectively occupies tetrahedral sites in the o phase , while ga and mn ions randomly occupies in the d phase .",
    "thus , a dimensionality in conduction can change from 2d in the o sample to 3d in the d sample , which can be a possible origin of the decrease of the resistivity .",
    "another possibility is a change of electronic structure induced by the disordering of a site .",
    "a - site disordering generally induces a random potential in a perovskite oxide , which may affect the electronic structure of the material .",
    "indeed , it is theoretically found that the introduced random potential in the hubbard hamiltonian causes an antiferromagnetic metallic phase instead of the antiferromagnetic insulating state @xcite .",
    "although the origin of the difference of the resistivity is not clear at present , this system can be a good playground for investigating a - site disorder effect on antiferromagnetic insulator with mn@xmath5 .",
    "in summary , we have measured x - ray diffraction , resistivity , thermopower , and magnetization of sr@xmath0ermn@xmath1ga@xmath2o@xmath3 system , in which a - site ordered tetragonal phase appears above @xmath4 , and observed large negative thermopower , semiconducting conduction , and magnetic susceptibility with a kink at 60 k implying antiferromagnetism .",
    "we succeed to prepare both a - site ordered and disordered phases for @xmath4 sample and observe a significant decrease of the resistivity in the disordered phase .",
    "we attribute this to a change of dimensionality in conduction and/or a change of electronic structure induced by the disordering of a sites .",
