    "the problem of the interplay between superconductivity and other broken symmetry states is one of the central problems in the physics of strongly correlated systems .",
    "this issue is particularly pressing in the context of the cuprate and their complex phase diagram .",
    "in addition to nel antiferromagnetic order and high @xmath3 uniform @xmath4 superconductivity , a host of other ordered phases , including incommensurate spin stripes ( which exhibit spin - density - wave ( sdw ) order ) , incommensurate charge stripes ( with charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order ) , electronic nematic order , and time - reversal ( and/or mirror - plane ) symmetry - breaking have been reported essentially in all the cuprate .@xcite",
    "static spin stripe order is seen in the lanthanum family of the cuprate superconductors.@xcite static charge stripe order is seen in ( lbco),@xcite in ( ybco),@xcite in high magnetic fields ( where otherwise is seen as short range order@xcite ) , and in ( bscco).@xcite nematic charge order is seen in ybco@xcite and in bscco@xcite over a wide range of doping and temperatures .",
    "time - reversal and/or mirror plane ( or inversion ) symmetry breaking has also been reported in ybco , in lbco and in bscco@xcite although recent nmr measurements do not detect magnetism in the same samples.@xcite stripe and/or nematic orders of these types are also seen in the iron superconductors@xcite and in heavy fermion materials.@xcite    a key feature of the orders that are seen in these strongly correlated materials is that the orders are intertwined with each other rather instead of competing with each other.@xcite by intertwined orders what we mean@xcite is that the orders appear either together and/or with similar strengths , e.g. at critical temperatures of similar magnitude , over a significant range of parameters ( doping , coupling constants , etc . ) instead , if the orders were competing with each other , one of the orders will be stronger and the others will be strongly suppressed .",
    "the exception to this rule are systems which are close to a multicritical point at which not only the critical temperatures but also all the couplings between the different orders are finely - tuned to very specific relations ( and values ) .",
    "while this can happen in a particular material at a particular doping it is unnatural to assume that multicriticality should generically occur in all materials and for a wide range of parameters .",
    "a case that is particularly relevant from the perspective of intertwined orders is lbco , particularly near the so - called 1/8 anomaly . in this material",
    "the @xmath3 of the uniform @xmath1-wave superconductivity is suppressed ( down to low - temperatures ) . yet ,",
    "a variety of experimental probes show that over essentially the same temperature range where at other dopings lbco is a @xmath1-wave superconductors , near 1/8 doping a host of other orders are observed , including charge - stripe order , spin stripe order and a most peculiar phase in which the cuo planes appear to be superconducting but yet the material remains insulating along the c - axis.@xcite the layer - decoupling effect is also seen in lbco away from @xmath5 at finite fields@xcite and also in underdoped lsco materials at finite magnetic fields@xcite where a field - induced stripe - ordered state had been observed previously.@xcite    it was suggested by berg and coworkers that this peculiar layer - decoupling effect can be naturally explained if the cuo planes are in an inhomogeneous , striped , superconducting state with the symmetry of a pair - density wave ( pdw ) state in which charge , spin and superconducting orders are intertwined with each other.@xcite the local superconducting order parameter @xmath6 in a pdw state is spatially modulated and a spin singlet . for a state with unidirectional modulation , @xmath6 has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 are two slowly - varying complex fields and @xmath9 is the ordering wave vector .",
    "hence , the unidirectional pdw superconducting state is characterized by two complex order parameters , @xmath8 .",
    "a state with the pdw pattern of superconducting order was proposed already in 1964 by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite ( lo ) and by fulde and ferrell@xcite ( ff ) to arise in the presence of a zeeman field . as is the case of",
    "all ordered phases with a finite wave vector , the lo state , and its time - reversal breaking ( spiral ) cousin ff , requires that a nesting condition be satisfied for this state to occur in the weak coupling bcs regime ( for a review on fflo states see ref .",
    "[ ] ) . in most cases this nesting conditions",
    "is hardly ever satisfied .",
    "thus , states of this type can only exist in a strongly coupled regime which is clearly outside the applicability of a weak coupling theory such as bcs .",
    "motivated by the lbco results , and using the bcs framework , loder and coworkers @xcite found a pdw state in a tight - binding model with @xmath1-wave pairing in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "however , these authors found that the critical value of the coupling constant for which the pdw is the ground state is quite large and hence well outside the regime in which bcs theory is reliable .",
    "more recently , a pdw state has been found in variational monte carlo simulations of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 model at zero magnetic field , @xcite although in these simulations appear to favor the uniform sc state over the pdw state only by a small amount of energy .",
    "however , recent , sophisticated ipeps ( infinite projected entangled pair - states@xcite ) simulations have found strong evidence for intertwined orders ( in which several orders , including the pdw state , appear to be essentially degenerate in energy ) in the @xmath10 model over a significant range of coupling constants and doping.@xcite a recent paper by p. a. lee ( which appeared as this work was being finished ) suggests that pdw states may arise in a slave - particle rvb approach@xcite by postulating an `` amperian '' interaction among the spinons.@xcite on the other hand , a pdw state is known to exist in the spin - gap state of the kondo - heisenberg chain@xcite and also in a two - leg ladder,@xcite even in the weak coupling limit .",
    "fflo states have been proposed to explain some of the properties of heavy fermion superconductors @xcite and have been conjectured to arise in cold atomic systems .",
    "@xcite fflo states were studied in two dimensions by shimahara @xcite where the fflo states seem to be more robust .    here",
    "we will investigate the relation between pdw states and nematic order .",
    "although charge nematic order ( a spatially - uniform spin - singlet state that breaks rotational invariance ) does neither favor nor disfavor superconductivity , except in regimes in which @xmath2-wave and @xmath1-wave superconductivity are in close competition@xcite ( see , however , ref .",
    "[ ] ) , here we will show that a nematic state in the spin triplet channel@xcite can favor unconventional superconducting phases , including a pdw state . in this work we present the study of the presence of an inhomogeneous superconducting instability in an system that is already in an @xmath12 or @xmath13 nematic phase .",
    "we will use a mean field analysis in the weak coupling limit to show that in a region of the phase diagram , an inhomogeneous superconducting state is the ground state of the system .",
    "oganesyan and coworkers@xcite ( as well as refs .",
    "[ ] ) studied a spinless nematic fermi fluid ( fl ) , where the breaking of rotational symmetry manifest in a spontaneous quadrupolar ( elliptical ) distortion of the fermi surface , while the translation invariance is preserved ( for a review see ref .",
    "[ ] ) . in the charge nematic state",
    "the fs has a spontaneous quadrupolar ( elliptical ) distortion .",
    "nematic phases of fermi fluids can arise either via a pomeranchuk instability of a fermi liquid@xcite or by quantum melting of charge stripe phases.@xcite the resulting anisotropic fluids are non - fermi liquids if the lattice effects are weak enough .",
    "@xcite generalized the aforementioned work of oganesyan and coworkers to a system of spin-1/2 fermions and found a generalization of the nematic state to the spin triplet channel which they called an @xmath12-phase . in this phase rotational symmetry",
    "is broken both in real and in the internal spin space , while while remaining invariant under a combination of a discrete set of rotations in both sectors .",
    "in addition , they also found another , spatially isotropic phase , which they called the @xmath13-phase ( in analogy to the @xmath14 phase in liquid @xmath15he ) . this state is uniform and spatially isotropic , but the spin quantization axis of a fermionic quasiparticle on the fermi surface lies in - plane and winds around the fs with an integer - valued winding number . in both phases the fs for spin up and down is distorted in different ways ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : ellipses ] , [ fig : betaw2 ] , and [ fig : betaw1 ] ) providing a natural system to studied the presence of an instability to an inhomogeneous superconducting state . in a fermi",
    "liquid setting , the phase transition to the spin triplet nematic phases occurs as a pomeranchuk instability and hence the tuning parameter is a landau parameter in the spin triplet channel . in a strong coupling setting",
    "it can occur by quantum melting of a spin - stripe state . in what follows",
    "we will refer to both the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 phases as spin - triplet nematic phases ( although in a strict sense they are not ) .    in the conventional bcs approach@xcite",
    "the fflo states arise only in a regime in which there is a sufficiently weak zeeman coupling to an uniform magnetic field so that the sc instability can only occur for cooper pairs with finite momentum by suppressing the nesting between electronic states at the fermi surfaces for both spin projections . however , this assumption is a severe limitation and , to this date , zeeman - field - tuned fflo states have not been clearly seen in experiment .",
    "in contrast here we we will see that in the spin triplet nematic phases ( which although magnetic have a zero uniform zeeman field ) the tuning parameter for the sc instability is the distance to the nematic spin triplet quantum critical point .",
    "in particular we will find that depending on whether the nematic is an @xmath12 or a @xmath13 phase a host of different sc states , both uniform and inhomogeneous , can occur .",
    "unfortunately to this date there is no clear evidence for a spin triplet nematic state . on the theoretical side",
    "a recent paper by maharaj and coworkers@xcite found a spin - triplet @xmath13-phase in a fermionic system on a honeycomb lattice via a pomeranchuk instability .",
    "fischer and kim found a nematic - spin - nematic state ( the @xmath12 spin - triplet nematic state ) in a mean - field analysis of the three - band emery model of the cuprates in a regime in which the hubbard @xmath16 on the cu sites and on the o sites ( @xmath17 ) are both large ( and comparable).@xcite on the experimental side , there is evidence of time reversal - symmetry - breaking in close to the pseudogap temperature in spin - polarized neutron scattering@xcite and , with some caveats , in kerr rotation experiments.@xcite however , the kerr rotation experiments can also be interpreted as evidence of inversion symmetry breaking via a gyrotropic effect in a system with charge order.@xcite hence the kerr effect measurements do not on their own prove the existence of as state with broken time reversal invariance since the cuprate superconductors are now known to exhibit charge order . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - polarized neutron experiments can be interpreted either as evidence for loop current order@xcite or as evidence of a nematic spin triplet state which on a cuo lattice means that the oxygens are spin - polarized but their polarization is opposite along the @xmath18 and @xmath19 axis ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ ybco ] ) .",
    "however such a state is incompatible with nmr measurements which do not find evidence of any sublattice magnetization in ybco and hbco which have instead a substantial spin gap .",
    "aside from these important caveats and reservations , we find that it is nevertheless useful to consider the possible role of spin triplet nematic phases in a weak - coupling mechanism for pair - density - wave phases . in this work",
    "we will consider a system in a spin triplet nematic state but close to the pomeranchuk quantum critical point . by restricting ourselves to this regime",
    "enable us to use controlled approximations .",
    "we will assume that the system of interest is inside a spin - triplet nematic state , sufficiently close to the quantum phase transition so that the magnitude of the order parameter .",
    "however we will also assume that we are deep enough in the spin - triplet nematic phase so that the quantum critical fluctuations can be safely ignored .",
    "furthermore we will also ignore the possible non - fermi liquid physics which may arise in the spin - triplet nematic state .",
    "thus , the main assumption that we will use throughout is the existence to the pomeranchuk quantum critical point and that the resulting @xmath12 and @xmath13 phases are stable . for this reason we will not consider the @xmath20 case since these phases are unstable in the absence of sufficiently strong spin - orbit interactions.@xcite",
    "we will show that , depending on the particular spin triplet nematic phase that is considered , different uniform superconducting phases arise ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 or @xmath1 wave ) and that these phases are in close competition with inhomogeneous phases with the symmetry of a pair - density - wave of the lo type .",
    "ff states are generally found to be metastable at least close to the thermal phase boundary .",
    "the main results of this work are summarized in three phase diagrams , one for the spin triplet nematic @xmath12 phase with pairing in the @xmath1-wave superconducting channel ( shown in fig.[phasediagram ] ) and two for the spin triplet nematic @xmath13 phase with pairing in the @xmath2 and @xmath1 wave superconducting channels ( shown in fig.[fig : beta - diagram - swave ] and fig.[fig : beta - diagram - dwave ] respectively . )",
    "we also determine the structure of the landau - ginzburg free energies close to the thermal transition and calculate the coefficients and stiffnesses .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams turn out to be quite complex . in the case of the @xmath12 phase",
    "the superconducting states which arise are , in addition to a spin - triplet @xmath0 wave state , a uniform spin singlet @xmath1-wave sc , a bidirectional pdw state , and a unidirectional pdw state . on the other hand , in the case of the @xmath13 phase the uniform state may be an @xmath2-wave or a @xmath1 wave sc . if the pairing channel is @xmath2 wave , in the @xmath13 phase we find unidirectional , bidirectional and tridirectional pdw states and , in addition , a triple - helix ff - type state . if the pairing channel is @xmath1-wave , in addition to an uniform @xmath1-wave sc , we also find both a unidirectional and two bidirectional pdw phases .",
    "we also investigate the nature of the phase transitions between these states close to the thermal phase boundary .",
    "a rich set of different behaviors are found , including continuous and first order phase transitions as well as lifshitz points and other multicritical points .",
    "it is important to emphasize that these results , obtained using a weak coupling bcs theory , are controlled by the distance to the spin triplet nematic quantum critical point .",
    "thus the spin triplet nematic quantum critical point plays the role of a complex multicritical point .",

    "hamiltonian @xcite for a spin - triplet nematic phase is : @xmath21\\cdot { \\bm \\sigma}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\}c^{}_{{\\bm k},\\beta}\\\\   & + \\frac{|{\\bm n}_1|^2+|{\\bm n}_2|^2}{2|f_l^a| }   \\label{hmfnematic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the order parameters for the spin - triplet nematic phase , @xmath24 are the three @xmath25 pauli matrices , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the polar angle between @xmath28 and the @xmath29 axis and @xmath30 are the landau parameters in the spin triplet channel of fermi liquid theory.@xcite    the order parameter fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 transform under a global @xmath31 rotation @xmath32 in the spin channel ( denoted here by @xmath33 ) as follows @xmath34 in addition , the order parameter fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 transform as follows under a spatial rotation by a global angle @xmath27 about the @xmath35 axis perpendicular to the 2d plane @xmath36 we will refer to this as the @xmath37 `` orbital '' ( or spatial ) rotational invariance .",
    "this symmetry is exact in an electron fluid in the continuum and reduces to a discrete subgroup for a lattice model , i.e. the point or space group of the lattice , and it is contained in the symmetries of the free - fermion band structure denoted in eq . by @xmath38 . for simplicity in this paper",
    "we will consider an electron fluid in the continuum in which case @xmath39 is invariant under @xmath37 rotations .    the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy for the system must be invariant under the global combined symmetry @xmath40 .",
    "we will focus first in the dependence of the gl free energy for phases in which the order parameter fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 take uniform values , and hence do not depends on the position @xmath41 . under this assumption , to low orders in the order parameter fields , the most general @xmath40-invariant form of the gl free energy is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are three parameters ( or coupling constants ) .",
    "as usual @xmath43 is a linear measure of the distance to the critical temperature ( for the thermal transition ) or to the critical coupling constants ( e.g. the landau parameters @xmath46 ) in the case of the quantum phase transition .    for @xmath47",
    "the system is in a broken symmetry state , and the gl free energy in eq . has two type of solutions depending on the sign of @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath48 it is most favorable to have a state where @xmath49 .",

    "in particular we will see that for @xmath71 small enough there are sc instabilities in the weak coupling regimes of these coupling constants .",
    "therefore , the theory we are presenting in this work can be regarded as a theory of a multicritical point for a system close to spin - triplet nematic phases and superconducting phases ( both uniform and non - uniform ) .",

    "a principal motivation for this work was to investigate using controlled approximations the possible relation between electronic liquid crystal phases ( of which the spin triplet nematic states are just two examples ) and superconductivity .",
    "our results indicate that this type of electronic liquid crystal phases naturally give raise to complex inhomogeneous superconducting phases .",
    "unfortunately , so far as we know , spin - triplet nematic metallic phases have yet to be discovered in experiment .    earlier studies of superconducting instabilities in spin - singlet nematic phases did not reach a clear answer.@xcite in addition , pdw phases and others of similar nature , are notoriously difficult to study as they are outside the reach of weak coupling bcs theory.@xcite on the other hand , high - quality numerical tensor - network approaches such as ipeps have provided solid evidence for the existence ( or , at least , competitiveness ) of pdw phases in simple 2d strongly correlated systems such as the @xmath10 model.@xcite interestingly these authors find that some degree of fixed nematicity ( i.e. explicit rotational symmetry breaking ) strongly favors pdw ordered sc states .",
    "in addition , commensurate pdw phases have been shown to occur in kondo - heisenberg chains@xcite and in doped spin - ladders.@xcite    the models we studied is this paper are , on the other hand , too idealized as they stand to be relevant to the physics of the cuprates .",
    "in addition of the important role of magnetism that these spin - triplet phases imply , for which there is no evidence in these materials , we have used a continuum description with simple ( nearly circular ) fermi surfaces . in strongly correlated systems",
    "rotational spatial symmetry is strongly broken down to the point group symmetry of the lattice .",
    "so far there are few studies of lattice models with nematic spin - triplet phases@xcite and they typically find that this pomeranchuk type phase transition requires a substantial value of the one - site hubbard interactions which put them outside the regime in which their mean field theories may be reliable .",
    "nevertheless these results are interesting and suggest that pdw type phases may also arise in these models .",
    "using weak coupling bcs - type methods we showed that nematic spin triplet @xmath12 and @xmath13 phases give rise to a complex phase diagram which includes pair - density - wave phases and other spatially inhomogeneous superconducting states . rather than considering a specific microscopic model we used instead effective pairing interactions in different channels ( @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 wave ) , with effective coupling constants for each , and investigated what superconducting states arose as instabilities of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 spin - triplet nematic states .",
    "the theory is well controlled by tuning to the nematic spin triplet to normal fermi liquid quantum phase transition .",
    "the distance to this quantum critical point inside the nematic spin triplet states plays the role of the small parameter which justifies the use of weak coupling mean field theory ( bcs ) to describe the resulting superconducting states . in this sense",
    ", the nematic spin triplet quantum phase transition can be regarded as a complex multicritical point .",
    "an important feature of the phase diagrams that we present here is that the critical temperatures of all the phases have comparable magnitude .",
    "this is the consequence of having fine - tuned to the spin - triplet nematic quantum critical point .",
    "a puzzling feature of the intertwined orders seen in the experiments in the cuprate superconductors is that the critical temperatures have the same typical magnitude over a substantial range of doping and for rather different materials .",
    "it is unreasonable to think that all the cuprate superconductors have conspired to be fine - tuned to a multicritical point as in the calculation that we have done here .",
    "rather this is presumably a consequence of strong correlation physics as in the recent work of corboz , rice and troyer@xcite .",
    "finally , in this paper we assumed that we were deep enough in the spin - triplet nematic phase that its quantum fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "this is clearly not the case close enough to the quantum phase transition from the fermi liquid phase .",
    "in addition we also neglected the possible role of goldstone modes of the nematic triplet state .",
    "these modes , which are gapped by lattice effects , may drive the fermionic fluid into a non - fermi liquid regime in their absence and change the physics of the superconducting state in an essential way .",
    "in particular , in the absence of lattice effects , the goldstone modes may invalidate the use of bcs - type schemes which require the existence of sharply defined quasiparticles .",
