    "blazars form one of the most energetically extreme classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "blazars can be observed in all wavelengths , ranging from radio all the way up to @xmath0-rays .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is characterized by two broad non - thermal components , one from radio through optical , uv , or even x - rays , and a high - energy component from x - rays to @xmath0-rays .",
    "in addition to spanning across all observable frequencies , blazars are also highly variable across the electromagnetic spectrum , with timescales ranging down to just a few minutes at the highest energies .",
    "there are two fundamentally different approaches to model the seds and variability of blazars , generally referred to as leptonic and hadronic models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of blazar models ) . in the case of leptonic models , where leptons are the primary source of radiation , synchrotron , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , and external - compton ( ec ) radiation mechanisms",
    "are employed to explain the blazar sed ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the focus of the present study is also on a leptonic model . in hadronic models ,",
    "the low - energy sed component is still produced by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , while the high - energy component is dominated by the radiative output from ultrarelativistic protons , through photo - pion induced cascades and proton synchrotron emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one aspect common to all blazar models is a relativistic jet oriented at a small angle with respect to our line of sight , resulting in relativistic doppler boosting and the shortening of observed variability time scales .    given computational limitations , the complex physical processes in relativistic jets can , realistically , only be evaluated with certain simplifying approximations . in order to facilitate analytical as well as numerical calculations ,",
    "the two most common approximations employed in blazar jet models are to assume that the magnetic ( * b * ) field is randomly oriented and tangled , and that the lepton momentum distribution is isotropic in the comoving frame of the high - energy emission region .",
    "these two assumptions greatly simplify the evaluation of the synchrotron and compton emission by eliminating various integrals over the interaction and scattering angles . however , there is increasing evidence @xcite for a fairly well defined helical * b*-field structure within agn jets .",
    "these observations also suggest a spine - sheath geometry for agn jets .",
    "the differential velocity profiles within the jet is expected to create anisotropies in the particle distributions .",
    "it is therefore important to explore jet models where we can not only simulate an ordered * b*-field , but also study the resulting radiation behaviour with anisotropic lepton distributions .",
    "the standard approach to diagnosing the magnetic field properties is via synchrotron polarization .",
    "if the underlying distribution of emitting electrons is a power - law with power - law index @xmath1 , the maximum degree of synchrotron polarization is given by : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the synchrotron power per unit frequency in directions perpendicular and parallel to the projection of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky .",
    "using equation [ eq : synchpol ] we can see that for a power - law index of @xmath5 , the degree of polarization can be as high as 75% .",
    "it is therefore possible to estimate the magnetic field orientation based on polarization measurements , but an estimate of the field strength usually requires the consideration of flux and spectral properties of the synchrotron emission .",
    "furthermore , polarization measurements are notoriously difficult ( and even barely feasible at frequencies higher than optical ) , and may often not give realistic results due to faraday rotation and depolarization along the line of sight .",
    "in this work , we are interested in taking a complementary approach to estimating the magnetic field orientation where the difference in observed flux levels of the spectrum can give an estimate of how the magnetic orientation may be changing .",
    "ratio shows how the b - field estimate can vary depending on the electron power - law index and whether one assumes an isotropic b - field or a specific pitch angle.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the principle behind this approach can be demonstrated when one compares the * b*-field estimates based on a power - law distribution of electrons with an arbitrary power - law index , @xmath1 , and pitch angle , @xmath6 .",
    "the comparison of synchrotron emission coefficients for a power - law distribution of electrons with and without pitch - angle ( @xmath6 ) dependence gives us a measure of how the estimated magnetic field strength can differ .",
    "the emission coefficients can be found in @xcite and are given by ( in the units of @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron distribution power - law normalization .",
    "the above two expressions can be solved for the magnetic field to obtain : @xmath11 this gives an estimate of how , for a given luminosity , the * b*-field estimates can differ depending upon whether we assume an isotropic pitch angle approximation or a given pitch angle ( which , in the case of relativistic electrons , is equal to the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight ) .",
    "the above relation is only applicable in the optically thin regime .",
    "we can see in figure [ fig : bestimate ] that depending on the pitch angle assumption , and the electron distribution power - law index , the @xmath12 fraction can range from 0 ( there is negligible synchrotron emission along an ordered magnetic field ) to @xmath13 .",
    "because the compton emissivity is approximately isotropic for an isotropic distribution of electrons , the ratio @xmath14 will change with the pitch angle .",
    "it is therefore important to see how the overall synchrotron and synchrotron - self compton spectra differ with well ordered magnetic fields .",
    "one point worth noting is that in our set - up the lower limit on   orientation is limited by the @xmath15 approximation ( see section [ sec : synch ] ) ; a magnetic field perfectly aligned with the observing direction will give zero output .",
    "however , in a more rigorous treatment , the lower limit on the minimum angle , @xmath6 , for the  orientation will be determined by the relativistic beaming characteristic of synchrotron emission along an electron s direction of motion into a cone of opening angle @xmath16 , where @xmath0 is the electron lorentz factor . in the case of optical frequencies and magnetic fields of @xmath17  g , @xmath18 will be the order of @xmath19 , while in the x - ray regime @xmath20 . using the relation in equation [ eqn : bestimate ] it is possible to estimate the effects on the  estimates between this value of @xmath18 and an isotropic magnetic field . for a power - law index of 3",

    "this allows the model to be modular and build an arbitrarily large volume with any desired anisotropies .",
    "each cell contains a magnetic field plus electron and photon distributions .",
    "the magnetic field can have an arbitrary orientation and strength in each cell .",
    "this means that the overall volume can be modelled to contain a completely uniform , partially anisotropic , or pseudo - random * b*-field .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to isolate the effects of the degree of order and orientation of the magnetic field on the emerging synchrotron emission .",
    "therefore , we choose the simplest conceivable approach concerning the electron distribution , and do not take electron cooling into account .",
    "this means , we only focus on static electron distributions which do not evolve due to energy losses . in future work",
    "we aim to include self - consistent cooling effects which would also allow us to probe how the pitch - angle dependence of the synchrotron cooling would give rise to different electron distributions in different cells , depending on the magnetic field set - up .    the directional information in the electron and photon distributions and the   is with respect to the cell . in the case of electrons",
    "the distribution is a function of energy and two angles with respect to the cell ( see figure [ fig : eleb ] ) .",
    "this gives us the ability to create anisotropies in the electron distributions as well by either having preferential direction for the electrons or by setting up the electron distributions differently in various cells .",
    "for both electrons and photons , the distributions energy grids ( lorentz factor @xmath0 for electrons and frequency @xmath22 for the photons ) are calculated using logarithmic binning .",
    "therefore each distribution is modelled using a 3 dimensional array with the dimensions of @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "figures [ fig : eleb ] ( right ) illustrates how various angles with respect to the cell are defined .",
    "angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 run from 0 to @xmath26 and 0 to 2@xmath26 respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : volgeo ] we can see how the overall volume can be constructed from individual cells . for a given viewing angle , the emission from the visible outer layer of cells is combined to produce an overall spectrum from an effectively larger volume .",
    "the simulation currently transfers , from one cell to another , only the photons . in order to achieve this",
    ", we need to calculate which of the six cubic faces a given photon direction will intersect . to calculate this",
    ", we assume that all the photons are produced in the center of the cell , and then trace photon paths in any given direction towards the nearest boundary .",
    "even though our simulation considers a static situation , the transfer and radiative feedback between different cells requires an inherent time - dependence in the code .",
    "the time step for our radiation transfer approach is the light crossing time across a single cell , which is equal to the time it takes for the photons to travel from one cell to another . at the end of each time step and",
    "depending on the physical processes being modelled , the photon distribution is modified and passed to the appropriate neighbour . when being passed to a neighbour",
    "the entire photon distribution is passed .",
    "therefore at the end of a time - step each cell s ( intrinsic ) photon distribution is emptied into six neighbouring cells , unless it is a boundary cell .",
    "the six incoming ( transiting ) photon distributions are stored until the start of the following time - step when they are combined to form a single intrinsic photon distribution again .",
    "the physical processes are then carried out on this single photon distribution .",
    "synchrotron radiation is calculated first and the photons added to the intrinsic distribution .",
    "compton scattering is carried out after the synchrotron radiation . at this point",
    "we reach the end of a time - step and the process of transferring photon distributions to neighbouring cells begins again .",
    "the observed photon distribution originates from the boundary cells .",
    "the photon distributions emerging from visible faces of the boundary cells are combined to create a single observed photon distribution .",
    "this process of combining the photon distributions from the boundary cells in effect treats the whole multi - cell structure like a single cubic / cuboid structure .",
    "here we highlight the key points of the synchrotron radiation treatment that we follow .",
    "a more in - depth analysis and details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron emissivity per electron , @xmath27 , is given by : @xmath28 where f(x ) is given by : @xmath29 @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the critical frequency given by @xmath32c .",
    "@xmath6 , the pitch angle , is calculated using spherical trigonometry : @xmath33 the synchrotron emission coefficient is given by : @xmath34 the numerical bessel function integration in equation [ eqn : bessel ] can be time consuming .",
    "however , some fast routines to perform this integration are given by @xcite which we modified for our precision and computer language .    in a full treatment of the synchrotron radiation the emitted photons",
    "are distributed within a solid angle ( @xmath35 ) about the pitch angle @xmath6 . however ,",
    "for our purposes we assume the emitted photons travel in the same direction as the emitting electrons .",
    "a detailed calculation of synchrotron self - absorption can be found @xcite .",
    "the absorption coefficient when recast in terms of electron lorentz factors , @xmath0 , instead of @xmath36 , can be written as : @xmath37 the photons produced via synchrotron radiation are added to the intrinsic photon distribution of the cell .",
    "the photons received from neighbouring cells are added to the intrinsic photon distribution prior to calculating the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "therefore the photons passing through any cell are also synchrotron self - absorbed .",
    "the emission and absorption coefficients are used to calculate the total spectrum , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the optical depth and _ l _ is the size of the emission zone / cell .",
    "to @xmath40 off electrons @xmath41,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the limit @xmath42 , and in the electron rest frame , the incident photon travels in nearly the opposite direction to the electron .",
    "this is due to photon aberration : @xmath43 when @xmath44 , @xmath45 , we are in the head - on approximation regime , which we employ to greatly simplify compton cross section calculations .",
    "that is , we can assume that the scattered photon solid angle , @xmath46 , is well approximated by the electron solid angle @xmath47 . when the differential compton ( klein - nishina ) cross section is integrated over @xmath46 , we get @xcite : @xmath48 where h is a heaviside function , @xmath49 , and the compton kernel is given by : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the compton cross section can then be used in the emission coefficient formula to obtain the comptonized spectrum .",
    "the head - on approximation simplifies the emission coefficient calculation by eliminating two integrals from the compton emissivity treatment without the approximation .",
    "the following relation can be used to obtain the number of interacting photons : @xmath52 the interacting photons are a combination of photons originating from synchrotron radiation and the photons received from neighbouring cells . at the start of a time - step",
    ", the photon distributions received from the neighbouring cells are combined , while preserving the direction information , to form the intrinsic photon distribution .",
    "synchrotron photons are also added to the intrinsic photon distribution .",
    "the total photon distribution is then used in the compton emissivity relation to obtain the compton spectrum in the head - on approximation , given by :    @xmath53    after the intrinsic photon distribution has been compton scattered it is redistributed based on change in energy and direction .",
    "the redistributed photon distribution is then used to work out which neighbouring cells receive which proportion of the distribution .      the overall spectrum is obtained by combining the synchrotron and compton spectra . as it stands in our model , synchrotron emission is the only source of photons which are then compton scattered by the same population of electrons .",
    "the resulting photon spectrum is given as a function of two cell angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see figure [ fig : eleb ] ) .",
    "although not included in the present study , it is straight forward to include external compton effects by adding the external photon field to the photon distributions .",

    "the figure also demonstrates the fact that only the synchrotron spectrum component is heavily affected by the  orientation .",
    "the compton scattered component of the spectrum is almost independent of the  orientation .",
    "the main reason for this is that the photon distribution anisotropies introduced by the  orientation are lost when scattering off an isotropic distribution of electrons .",
    "the small variations that remain are due to the @xmath72 factor present in compton emissivity calculations .",
    "the line of sight and photon anisotropies therefore affect the extent to which the compton spectrum is boosted .",

    "the inverse compton to synchrotron ratio @xmath74 differs by a factor @xmath750.68 between the two calculations .",
    "this is most likely due to differing geometries . for a sphere ,",
    "the average photon escape time is @xmath76 , whereas in our cubic set up , due to the way radiation transport between cells is treated ( see section [ sec : volume ] ) , a photon takes , on average , @xmath77 to escape the region ( @xmath78 is the width of an individual cell ) . since the flux ratio @xmath79 and the volume - averaged radiation energy density @xmath80 is proportional to the photon escape time scale , the longer photon escape time scale in the spherical geometry results in a larger ssc flux .",

    "figures [ fig : mrk421_0402 ] , [ fig : mrk421_0802 ] , and [ fig : mrk421_1802 ] show fits to mrk 421 data using our code .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to explore the impact of the  orientation on the fit parameters , especially the   estimates . in figure",
    "[ fig : mrk421_0402 ] we can see that the synchrotron component is best fit for a particular  orientation ( see table [ tab : mrkparams ] for fit parameters ) .",
    "the gamma - ray data , however , is fit well with all the orientations .",
    "this is due the fact that the self - compton spectrum is not affected much by the  orientation ( see the discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "there is a significant difference in the synchrotron peak when comparing various   orientations .",
    "the spectra in figure [ fig : mrk421_0402 ] show that at a good fit is achieved when the  is oriented at @xmath81 with a strength of @xmath82  g. however , the fit shown is not unique .",
    "we can see in figures [ fig : mrk421_0802 ] and [ fig : mrk421_1802 ] that for identical parameters , except the  strength , the best - fit  orientation is very different . in one case",
    "a pseudo - random   provides the best fit with @xmath83  g , while for @xmath84  g , a  orientation of @xmath85 provides the best fit .",
    "therefore good fits can be achieved with different  strengths at different orientations .",
    "the main point here is the fact that it is possible to over- or underestimate the  strength when assuming it to be randomly oriented . in the cases presented here ,",
    "the  strength ranges from 0.18 g to 0.25 g for very similar fits to the data , but with different magnetic - field orientations .",
    "therefore it is possible to overestimate the magnetic field strength by at least @xmath86 if a particular   orientation , whether uniform or tangled , is assumed .",
    "if the  were pointed closely aligned with the line of sight , much higher  values will be necessary to obtain similar fits ( see discussion in section [ subsec : bestimate ] ) .",
    "we also note that the bulk lorentz factor used in the fits are lower than the values obtained by some authors for fitting mrk 421 data ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "the value of the bulk lorentz factor values used in our fits is likely to be on the lower end of the limits imposed by pair opacity arguments @xcite .",
    "however , the main point of this paper is not the determination of actual best - fit values for mrk  421 ( which would not be realistic due to our neglect of cooling effects anyway ) , but to demonstrate the orientation - dependent magnetic - field degeneracy in the course of blazar sed fitting .",
    "in this paper we have presented first results from a new relativistic jet radiation transfer code that we are currently developing . here",
    "we take the full angular dependence into account when modelling synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton processes .",
    "we are able to model the  at arbitrary orientations and study its impact on the resulting spectra .",
    "we have seen that the  orientation plays an important role on the normalization of the synchrotron spectrum . using fits to markarian 421 data ,",
    "we have shown how the  orientation can mislead into over / under - estimating its strength .",
    "any future work should therefore be mindful of the fact that the underlying assumption about the  orientation will play a considerable role in the errors associated with the magnetic field strength estimates ."
