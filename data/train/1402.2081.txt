    "a single layer of inas self - assembled qds , with a density of @xmath50100 m@xmath51 and an inhomogeneously broadened spectrum spanning the range of 920@xmath2325 nm , was grown by molecular beam epitaxy in the center of the membrane .",
    "the photonic crystal structures were defined on a layer of resist ( zep 520a ) by electron - beam lithography and then transferred into the gaas layer by using a chlorine based coupled plasma reactive - ion etching .",
    "suspended membrane structures were formed by removing a 1-m - thick algaas sacrificial layer underneath the gaas layer with hydrofluoric acid vapour .",
    "all waveguide samples used in the experiments are terminated by either inverse tapered or second - order bragg grating mode adapters @xcite .",
    "these mode adapters are best suited for coupling out low @xmath52 ( fast propagating ) modes . however , light - matter interaction is strongest for high @xmath52 ( slowly propagating ) modes .",
    "a typical sample combining two distinct waveguide sections is shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure1](a ) .",
    "the two sections shown as the blue and red shaded regions are designed to support low-@xmath52 and high-@xmath52 modes , respectively , within their overlapping wavelength range ( @xmath53 910 - 930 nm ) . the determination of the dispersion relation for the waveguides allowed for a detailed comparison of the measured -factor with numerical simulations . for this purpose samples with increased reflectivity at the ends of the waveguide structure",
    "were fabricated in order to create sharp fabry - prot resonances .",
    "the free spectral range , @xmath54 , is given by the center wavelength of the nearest peak , @xmath55 , and the optical path length between the two reflective surfaces , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath52 denote the physical length of the structure and the group index .",
    "a transition region between the red and the blue waveguide sections coupling the different @xmath52 modes is used in order to minimize reflections at these interfaces @xcite .",
    "figure s[fig : supp_figure1](a ) shows an example of a sample that can be used to extract the dispersion relation of the waveguide mode .",
    "these waveguides are terminated by a photonic crystal on one side and by a grating mode adapter on the other side .",
    "while the waveguides have the same design parameters as the samples where the -factors have been measured , the grating is designed for longer wavelengths and has a different duty cycle than the gratings used in -factor measurements leading to an increased reflection back into the waveguide .",
    "the duty cycle is defined as the ratio between the optical length in the material and the optical length outside the material for a single period of the grating .",
    "the band edge of the red ( blue ) waveguide mode is spectrally positioned at around 930 nm ( 960 nm ) .",
    "the measurements are performed by moving the excitation spot along the waveguide from the blue to the red section , and collecting the photoluminescence from the grating .    when the sample is excited in the blue section",
    ", the wavelengths above the band edge of the red waveguide mode can not propagate in the red section of the sample , therefore the interface behaves like a high - reflectivity mirror . due to the high reflectivity of both the transition region and the grating structure ,",
    "sharp fabry - prot resonances appear in the spectral range between 930 and 960 nm .",
    "a high - power spectrum of these resonances is shown on the right side of figure s[fig : supp_figure1](b ) . the wavelength dependent group index @xmath58 for the blue waveguide mode is extracted as @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath55 is the central wavelength of the @xmath60th resonance , @xmath61 the length of the blue waveguide section , and @xmath62 the free spectral range .",
    "the free spectral range around the resonance is approximated as the average of the free spectral range on either side of the resonance @xmath63 .",
    "the central wavelength @xmath55 has been extracted by fitting each peak in the high - power spectrum with a lorentzian lineshape . due to the presence of anderson localization in the proximity of the band edge",
    ", the analysis has been limited to the wavelength region in which the fabry - prot resonances could be clearly distinguished from resonances arising due to random localization .",
    "when the excitation spot is in the red waveguide section , only wavelengths below 930 nm can propagate to the grating , and the fabry - prot fringes shown on the left side of figure s[fig : supp_figure1](b ) can be observed . in this second case ,",
    "the optical path length is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the length of the red waveguide section and @xmath66 its wavelength dependent group index .",
    "the group index @xmath66 can be calculated from : @xmath67 the values of @xmath58 and @xmath66 extracted experimentally are shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure1](c ) , together with the corresponding theory obtained from eigenvalue simulations of the structure .",

    "furthermore we have measured @xmath70 for several samples close to the band edge of the high-@xmath52 waveguide sections , which is where the high -factors are observed in our experiments .",

    "qds with a slow decay rate were also investigated with a ps - pulse diode laser with a variable repetition rate operated at 20 and 40 mhz and an excitation wavelength of 785 nm .",
    "the grating samples were investigated in a helium - flow cryostat operated at 10 k. both excitation and collection were performed with the same microscope objective ( na @xmath71 0.65 ) , where the excitation beam was moved to the center of the waveguide while the collection was done from the grating .",
    "the tapered samples were mounted in a helium - bath cryostat operating at 4.2 k. the excitation beam was focused by a top microscope objective with na @xmath71 0.5 , and emission was collected from the taper with another microscope objective with na @xmath71 0.65 .",
    "the sample and the excitation objective were positioned by two stacks of piezoelectric stages enabling motion in all three dimensions .",
    "emission was sent to a spectrometer ( 600 or 1200 grooves / mm grating ) , where a ccd was used for spectral measurements and avalanche photodiodes were used to record either the decay dynamics of the emitters as well as their intensity autocorrelation function .",
    "different attempts of measuring the high -factor in photonic - crystal waveguides have been reported in the literature .",

    "@xcite reported @xmath72 by the use of a top - collection confocal setup for both excitation and collection . with this method , however , only the photons leaking out of the waveguide are collected , which preferentially probes qds with relatively low coupling efficiency since the high -factor qds emit out of plane very weakly and are thus not detectable .",
    "furthermore , it is challenging to properly determine the decay rate of an uncoupled qd by top - collection measurements , since the spatial resolution of the collection optics is not sufficiently high to ensure that all detected lines originate from qds spatially positioned in the waveguide .",
    "finally , in this work the qd lines used to extract @xmath10 are spectrally positioned in the band gap of the photonic crystal , where the coupling to radiation modes is weaker than in the waveguide mode @xcite .",
    "this can potentially lead to overestimates of the -factor .    in order to overcome the potential issue of spatial mismatch",
    ", one approach has been to temperature tune a purcell - enhanced qd across the waveguide band edge and into the band - gap region @xcite . however , this approach is limited by the rather elevated temperatures required to obtain a sufficiently large tuning range , which cause an increase in the nonradiative decay @xmath5 and potentially residual coupling to the waveguide mode due to phonon - mediated processes @xcite .",
    "both these effects can significantly contribute to @xmath10 , and thus limited the extracted values of @xmath17 to 85.4% . in recent work ,",
    "experimental efforts have shifted towards the direct collection of photons coupled to the waveguide mode @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath10 was still extracted in a top - collection scheme @xcite , either from qds sitting in a defect - free pc or with a method similar to that used in ref .",

    "@xcite did not take into account any variation of @xmath5 between different qd samples used in different experiments",
    ".      measurements of the second order intensity correlation function were performed to ensure the single - photon nature of the emission from the qds . due to the strong purcell enhancement in proximity of the waveguide band edge and the the use of a density of qds of  100 m@xmath51 ,",
    "a pronounced background emission is present in high power spectra .",
    "for this reason , precisely pinpointing the saturation power for single qd lines by mean of intensity measurements was not straightforward , and only an estimate of the magnitude of the saturation power could be obtained from decay curve analysis .",
    "the approximate knowledge of the saturation power was used to ensure that time resolved and intensity correlation measurements under above band excitation were taken at powers well below saturation .      in order to obtain cleaner spectra and measure the saturation power precisely , excitation at longer wavelengths was performed .",
    "the data presented in figure 2(i ) of the main text have been recorded by exciting the qd at 880.02 nm .",
    "the excitation power was fixed to 0.63 times the saturation power of the quantum dot transition . a power series",
    "was used to extract the saturation power and to confirm that the line under investigation corresponds to a single exciton line .",
    "the decay rate of the qd measured under higher - wavelength excitation was @xmath11 = 6.28@xmath230.15 ns@xmath24 , corresponding to @xmath7598.43@xmath230.04% .",
    "figure s[fig : supp_figure4](b ) shows the autocorrelation function presented in figure 2(i ) of the main text for time delays of up to 2 s. one can notice the bunching at time delays close to zero , which is the typical signature of blinking @xcite . since the relevant time scale for operation of the single - photon source is the qd lifetime , we compare the residual central peak to its first neighbouring peak @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath76 = 0.2 , which quantifies the amount of multi - photon emission of the source .",
    "the area of the first neighbouring peak has been extracted by fitting the data shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure4](b ) with a single exponential decay , and evaluating the fit at @xmath77 = 13 ns . following the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we extract an excitation efficiency of  40% , which specifies the probability that the qd is emitting on the studied transition rather than blinking to another transition .",
    "numerical simulations using a finite - element method ( fem ) in the frequency domain have been performed to model the coupling to radiation modes for a dipole emitter coupled to a pcw .",
    "the total power emitted by the dipole in the waveguide relative to the total emitted power in a homogeneous medium can be expressed as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 0.91@xmath230.08 ns@xmath24 is the radiative decay rate of the qd in a homogeneous medium that is recorded experimentally . by computing the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see below ) for specific positions and dipole orientations , the radiative -factor can be obtained from @xmath80 , including the experimentally extracted value of @xmath5 leads to figure 1(e ) in the main text .",
    "the problem of defining appropriate boundary conditions for the waveguide mode in the numerical simulations has been overcome by applying a set of active boundary conditions at the two ends of the waveguide @xcite .",
    "the active boundary conditions absorb the propagating field with a mode profile given by the bloch mode and a field amplitude extracted from eigenvalue simulations .",
    "perfectly matched layers ( pmls ) are used at all the boundaries of the simulation domain except for the two planes at the ends of the pcw , where active boundary conditions are applied .",
    "the total power radiated by the dipole , @xmath81 , is extracted by integrating the power flowing out of a small cube surrounding the emitter .",
    "the power coupling to radiation modes , @xmath82 , is extracted with the same method , but using a box that surrounds the simulation domain .",
    "the yz - faces of this second box were left open to avoid including any contribution from the waveguide mode in the integration .",
    "convergence tests have been performed to ensure the accuracy of the results with respect to mesh size , length of the waveguide , height of the active boundary conditions , and size of the box used for the power integration .",
    "the power emitted into the waveguide mode can be then extracted from @xmath83 .    using the above outlined method",
    "@xmath84 is calculated for both x and y dipoles at different spatial positions within the waveguide and the results are presented in figure 4(a ) in the main text .",
    "these calculations are performed for @xmath85 and for @xmath86 in structures corresponding to the high-@xmath52 and to the low-@xmath52 waveguide sections , respectively . in figure 4(b ) in the main text , @xmath87 is shown for the same dipoles .",
    "the spectral positions within the respective waveguides were chosen to check the validity of the method used to extract the high -factors from the measurements of qds close to the band edge of the high-@xmath52 waveguide mode .",
    "an equivalent investigation was performed for a dipole far blue detuned from the waveguide mode band edge , @xmath88 , in structures corresponding to the high-@xmath52 waveguide section .",
    "these simulations where used to show the validity of our method for the qd detuned 20 nm from the waveguide mode band edge and still exhibiting a -factor above 90% . finally the two simulations performed at @xmath85 and @xmath88 were combined to show the broadband nature of these structures , which is presented in figure 1(e ) of the main text .",
    "the lowest exciton state of an inas qd is described by a five - level model , formed by the ground state , two bright states , and two dark states @xcite .",
    "due to an anisotropy in the strain , shape , and composition of the qd , the exchange interaction separates the bright states in energy by the fine structure splitting .",
    "these states become linearly polarized along the lattice directions @xmath89 $ ] and @xmath90 $ ] corresponding to the x- and y - direction of the photonic - crystal lattice shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure3](a ) @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the exciton states are labeled respectively @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the qd energy diagram is shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure3](b ) together with an indication of the main decay channels for each energy level .",
    "the two bright exciton states @xmath93 and @xmath94 can decay either radiatively to the ground state with decay rate @xmath95 or nonradiatively ( @xmath96 ) , or decay into a dark state through a spin - flip process ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the decay rate of the bright state can thus be expressed as the fast decay rate @xmath98 .",
    "the dark states @xmath99 and @xmath100 can not recombine through the emission of a photon , so they decay only nonradiatively to the ground state or into the bright state via spin flip with the slow decay rate @xmath101 . at the relevant temperatures for the present experiment @xmath102",
    "the bright - bright spin - flip rates are neglected in the model , since they are much smaller than the other decay rates @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath91 and @xmath92 excitons can be treated independently .    when the qd is embedded in a homogeneous medium ,",
    "the model describing the dynamics of the quantum dot population is a bi - exponential decay , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the amplitudes of each decay component .",
    "this model is derived by solving the rate equations for the population of each energy level @xcite .",
    "for qds in a photonic - crystal waveguide , the coupling to the waveguide mode changes the dynamics of the emitter .",
    "figure s[fig : supp_figure3](a ) shows the purcell factor distribution at @xmath108 for a dipole oriented along the y - direction ( top ) and the x - direction ( bottom ) . for certain positions in the waveguide unit cell , such as the one indicated in the figure , both orthogonal dipoles @xmath91 and @xmath92 are coupled to the waveguide mode . however , the dipole oriented along the y - direction experiences a different purcell enhancement than the dipole oriented along the x - direction . in this case , the decay curves are triple exponentials : @xmath109 where @xmath110 accounts for a time dependent background level due to the contribution of other emitters coupled to the waveguide mode .",
    "this background level is especially pronounced in high - density samples , where it may dominate the contribution from @xmath111 .",
    "the example of a decay curve fitted with the triple exponential model is shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure3](c ) , together with the individual decay components of the fit .",
    "the total radiative decay rate is given by the sum of the decay rate into the waveguide mode and the one into radiation modes ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "since it has been shown experimentally that @xmath113 @xcite , the radiative decay rate can be determined as @xmath114      we analysed the collection efficiency of the inverse taper and second - order bragg grating mode adapters using finite - element frequency domain calculations . in these calculations ,",
    "a dipole source is placed in the waveguide and its emission couples into the waveguide mode .",
    "as previously mentioned , the waveguides contain a high @xmath115 region followed by a low @xmath115 region , which is then connected to the out - coupler .",
    "we compute the fraction of light collected by a lens of given numerical aperture at one of the outcouplers .",
    "the results for the second - order bragg grating is shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure5](a ) .",
    "the gratings are optimized for a wavelength of @xmath116 nm which approximately corresponds to the band - edge of the waveguide .",
    "we computed that @xmath5045% of the light is collected by a lens with a numerical aperture @xmath117 , corresponding to the one used in the experiment , and that @xmath5070% of the emission can be collected by using a higher numerical aperture ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "our samples have outcouplers on both sides of the waveguide , and each grating couples light out of the waveguide mode to two different directions ( up or down )",
    ". therefore the ratio of the light collected at the lens to the total power in the waveguide mode corresponds to 25% of the efficiency shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure5](a ) .",
    "the insets in figure s[fig : supp_figure5](a ) show the far - field distribution intensity of light emitted from the gratings at two different wavelengths . as the far - fields are non - gaussian , they are not generally expected to couple well to single mode fibres although this has not been quantified further . in order to better clarify this point ,",
    "two orthogonal cross sections of the far - field patterns are shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure5](c ) .",
    "figure s[fig : supp_figure5](b ) shows the efficiency calculations for the inverse taper mode adapters .",
    "these structures have an efficiency of @xmath5045% across the waveguide band for a lens with @xmath117 and up to @xmath5070% for a lens with @xmath118 .",
    "since the mode can be coupled out on both sides of the waveguide , only half of the light is in the waveguide is coupled by a single taper . the far - field intensity shown in the insets of figure s[fig : supp_figure5](b ) indicates that the tapers have a more symmetric emission pattern than the gratings , although the cross sections of the far - field pattern shown in figure s[fig : supp_figure5](d ) reveal that the mode is non - gaussian , which will influence the coupling to a single - mode fiber .    the outcoupling efficiency of the gratings and tapers can be used to estimate the highest achievable count rate on the apd . in the limit where the quantum dot emits a single photon each time it is triggered by an optical pulse ,",
    "the figure of merit for the maximum number of photons available inside the waveguide is the beta - factor . since the repetition rate of the laser in the experiment was 76 mhz",
    ", this leads to 74.8 million photons per second created in the photonic - crystal waveguide for a beta - factor of 98.4% .",
    "since the propagation losses in our structures are negligible , this number is not significantly reduced after propagation .",
    "the presence of blinking observed in the autocorrelation measurement translates to an effective reduction of the excitation efficiency of the qd transition , which reduces the count rate in the waveguide to @xmath5030 million per second ; however electrically gated structures combined with resonant excitation have proven capable of eliminating this issue @xcite .",
    "the expected count rate at the photon detector can be estimated by considering the collection efficiency in the first lens of the outcouplers , and estimating the transmission efficiencies of each optical component in the setup .",
    "we have a beam sampler with @xmath5090% transmission in the collection arm , a total @xmath5050% loss in the fiber - to - fiber mating sleeves , 20% throughput of the spectrometer , and 35% efficiency of the single photon detector , which lead to an overall setup collection efficiency of @xmath503% .",
    "putting these numbers together leads to a highest achievable count rate of @xmath50100.000 counts per second from the grating structures . in our experiment",
    ", we typically measure @xmath5010.000 counts per second .",
    "the discrepancy between expected and measured count rates is most likely due to the mismatch between the non - gaussian shape of the outcoupled mode and the single - mode fiber mode .",
    "this could straightforwardly be improved by further design of the outcoupling structure ."

    "<S> the shaded region indicates where the predicted decay rate is above the experimentally extracted value of @xmath40 ns@xmath24 for the high -- factor qd . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the applied method for extracting the -factor by comparing @xmath11 and @xmath10 of two different qds is valid since the variation of the total loss rate @xmath41 between different qds is small . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the variations in @xmath5 over the wavelength range of relevance can be neglected @xcite while the spatial variation of @xmath4 has been calculated as shown in figure [ fig : figure3](b ) for an efficiently ( @xmath42 ) and weakly coupled ( @xmath43 ) qd . the chosen values of @xmath14 correspond to the cases of the qds shown in figure [ fig : figure2](e),[fig : figure2](g ) . for most positions , @xmath4 is found to be lower than the experimental estimate based on @xmath44 ( indicated by the dashed line in figure [ fig : figure3](a ) ) , which is expected since residual coupling to the waveguide will increase the rate . at a few spatial positions in figure [ fig : figure3](a ) , the predicted @xmath4 is found to be higher than the experimental rate . </S>",
    "<S> however , as displayed in figure [ fig : figure3](b ) these are not the positions where the large purcell - enhanced decay rates observed in the experiment appear ( experimental values indicated by the dashed line in figure [ fig : figure3](b ) ) , and we can thus exclude that the qds with highest -factor are positioned here , implying that the record - high -factors constitute conservative estimates .    in conclusion , we have for the first time unambiguously measured a near - unity -factor in a pcw , and have shown the robustness of @xmath17 with respect to the wavelength and the spatial position of the emitter in the pcw . </S>",
    "<S> this result proves the high potential of pcws to achieve strong on - chip light - matter coupling between a qd and a propagating mode , which opens the way for the realization of transistors and gates for deterministic quantum information processing . to this end </S>",
    "<S> highly coherent photon emission is required , and decoherence processes have been found to be slow for quasi - resonant excitation of qds in photonic crystals @xcite and could be further extended by applying true resonant excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a highly - efficient sp source can be built by optimizing the outcoupling mode adapters of our structures , making the source immediately applicable for linear - optics quantum - computing experiments .    </S>",
