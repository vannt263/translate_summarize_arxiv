    "the physical properties of multipartite systems are highly relevant for practical applications as well as foundational aspects . despite their importance , multipartite systems are in general very complex to describe and little analytical knowledge is available in the literature .",
    "well - known examples in many - body physics are the various spin models , which are simple to write down , but where typically not all properties can be determined analytically .",
    "the entanglement properties of multipartite systems are no exception and already for pure states it is known that a complete characterization is , in general , not a feasible task @xcite .",
    "this motivates the adoption of simplifications that enable analytical results or at least to infer properties in a numerically efficient way .",
    "one approach in this direction with broad impact in the literature is that based on a graph state encoding @xcite .",
    "mathematically , a graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges connecting the vertices .",
    "graph states are a class of genuinely multipartite entangled states that are represented by graphs .",
    "this class contains as a special case the whole class of cluster states , which are the key ingredients in paradigms of quantum computing , e.g. , the one - way quantum computer @xcite and quantum error correction @xcite or for the derivation of bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "interestingly , results and techniques of the mathematical theory of graphs can be translated into the graph state framework : one prominent example is the graph operation known as local complementation .",
    "the appeal of graph states comes in great part from the so - called stabilizer formalism @xcite .",
    "the stabilizer group of a given graph state can be constructed in a simple way from local pauli operators and is abelian ; the stabilizer operators associated to a given graph state are then used in a wide range of applications such as quantum error correcting codes @xcite , in the construction of bell - like theorems @xcite , entanglement witnesses @xcite , models of topological quantum computing @xcite and others .",
    "recently , there has been an interest in the generalization of graph states to a broader class of states known as _ hypergraph states _ @xcite . in a hypergraph",
    "an edge can connect more than two vertices , so hypergraph states are associated with many - body interactions beyond the usual two - body ones .",
    "interestingly , the mathematical description of hypergraph states is still very simple and elegant and in ref .",
    "@xcite a full classification of the local unitary equivalence classes of hypergraphs states up to four qubits was obtained . also , in refs .",
    "@xcite bell and kochen - specker inequalities have been derived and it has been shown that some hypergraph states violate local realism in a way that is exponentially increasing with the number of qubits . finally , recent studies in condensed matter theory showed that this class of states occur naturally in physical systems associated with topological phases @xcite .",
    "originally , hypergraph states were defined as members of an even broader class of states known as locally maximally entangleable ( lme ) states @xcite , which are associated to applications such as quantum fingerprinting protocols @xcite .",
    "hypergraph states are then known as @xmath1-lme states and display the main important features of the general class of lme states .",
    "up to now , hypergraph states were defined only in the multi - qubit setting , while graph states can be defined in systems with arbitrary dimensions . in higher dimensions",
    "graph states have many interesting properties not present in the two - dimensional setting .",
    "for example , there are considerable differences between systems where the underlying local dimensions are a prime or non - prime @xcite .",
    "another difference is the construction of bell - like arguments for higher - dimensional systems @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the definition of hypergraph states to multipartite systems of arbitrary dimensions ( qudits ) and analyse their entanglement properties .",
    "especially , we focus on the equivalence relations under local unitary ( lu ) operations or under stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication ( slocc ) . in particular , the possible local inter - conversions between different entangled hypergraph states are governed by a greatest - common - divisor hierarchy .",
    "note that the whole class of qudit graph states is a special case of our formulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we start by giving a brief review of the concepts and results that are at the basis of our formulation .",
    "this includes a description of the pauli and clifford groups in a @xmath0-dimensional system , as well as a general look on qudit graph states . in section iii",
    "we introduce the definitions associated with qudit hypergraph states .",
    "section iv presents some properties of the stabilizer formalism used for qudit hypergraph states .",
    "section v introduces the problem of classifying the slocc and lu classes of hypergraph states , first describing the different techniques employed and then proving a series of results on this classification . finally , we present some concrete examples in low dimensional tripartite systems , where already the main differences between systems of prime and non - prime dimensions become apparent .",
    "we reserve to the appendices the related subjects of a phase - space description and local complementation of qudit graphs .",
    "we consider an @xmath2-partite system @xmath3 , where the subsystems @xmath4 have the same dimension @xmath0 .",

    "the action of the local clifford group is richer and enables the conversion between different multi - graphs in a simple fashion . for prime dimensions , the action of the gate @xmath60 enables the conversion between edges of different multiplicities , while the gate @xmath61 is associated to the operation known as local complementation - see appendix b. moreover , in non - prime dimensions the possible conversions between edges are governed by a greatest common divisor hierarchy , as show in more generality ahead - see proposition 2 and theorem 4 .",
    "we introduce now the class of hypergraph states in a system with underlying finite dimension @xmath0 . before proceeding ,",

    "equivalently , one can define a hypergraph state as the unique @xmath55 eigenstate of a maximal set of commuting stabilizer operators @xmath77 ; we explain this approach after the proof of lemma 1 below .",
    "an important special class of hypergraph states are the so - called @xmath10-elementary hypergraph states , which are those constituted of a single hyperedge @xmath41 between @xmath10 qudits , i.e. , the state has the simple form @xmath78 . for this subclass ,",
    "the main entanglement properties depend on the multiplicity @xmath46 of the hyperedge , as shown in the next sections .    for completeness , we cite alternative formulations of hypergraph states that are potentially useful in other scenarios .",

    "the effect of applying the gate @xmath97 on an elementary hypergraph is then to create a hyperedge of same multiplicity on the neighbourhood of the qudit @xmath50 : @xmath98 it is important to notice that the hyperedges induced on the neighbourhood of @xmath50 by repeated applications of @xmath99 have multiplicities that are divisible by @xmath46 .",
    "depending on the primality of the underlying dimension @xmath0 , there are restricted possibilities of inducing hyperedges on neighbouring qudits via this procedure , a difference in relation to the qubit case .    moreover , since the local @xmath100 gate commutes with any @xmath71 , it can always be locally removed by applying @xmath101 . as explained previously ,",
    "we adopt the convention of representing any @xmath100 acting on a hypergraph state as a loop - a @xmath102-hyperedge - around the vertex @xmath50 ; higher potencies @xmath51 are represented by @xmath12 loops around @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the action of the local pauli group constituted of the unitaries @xmath103 is to create @xmath10 loops on the vertex @xmath50 and @xmath12-hyperedges on the neighbourhood of @xmath50 .",

    "it follows that @xmath315 does not have any prime factors already contained in @xmath318 since @xmath319 and @xmath314 are coprime , but @xmath315 may still have prime factors present in @xmath310 ( but absent in @xmath314 ) .",
    "if this is the case , we choose @xmath320 .",
    "this is allowed , since @xmath315 was defined @xmath321 .",
    "now , @xmath39 has no prime factors contained in @xmath310 ( but absent in @xmath314 ) , and still no prime factors contained in @xmath314 .",
    "so , it is coprime to @xmath0 , and @xmath111 is unitary .        for @xmath322 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath50 is coprime with @xmath0 , there exists @xmath323 such that @xmath324 ; this multiplicative inverse is given by @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is the carmichael function @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath327 given by @xmath328 is injective @xcite , since @xmath329 iff @xmath146 .",
    "but it is also surjective since it is a function from @xmath85 to itself .",
    "hence , @xmath84 is a bijection , the unitary @xmath330 is well - defined and @xmath331 ; notice that this corresponds to the clifford gate ( [ clifford ] ) . defining the clifford operator @xmath332",
    ", it follows that @xmath333 .    if @xmath334 , then there exists @xmath298 coprime with @xmath0 such that @xmath335 . in order to prove this , let us take the prime decomposition of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath336 .",
    "let us consider the decomposition @xcite @xmath337 , where @xmath338 . under this decomposition ,",
    "any @xmath339 is expressed as @xmath340 , where @xmath341 .",
    "given @xmath298 coprime with @xmath0 , it is straightforward that @xmath342 , where each component @xmath343 is coprime with @xmath344 ; indeed , these values @xmath298 are formed by all possible different combinations of the component values @xmath343 .",
    "the only values @xmath345 which are not already in the form @xmath335 can only happen for @xmath346 , for some fixed @xmath65 and @xmath347 , for fixed @xmath348 .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath345 is simply @xmath349 and the non - zero values @xmath350 , @xmath351 , are coprime with @xmath344 .",
    "thus , the values @xmath298 coprime with @xmath0 for which @xmath352 for all @xmath351 yields @xmath353 .    let @xmath110 ; then there exists @xmath298 , @xmath354 coprime with @xmath0 such that @xmath335 and @xmath355 , by the discussion above .",
