    "the leftmost few points in all of our spectra are averaged only over a small number of modes and should not be used to extrapolate to very low frequencies .",

    "gravitational radiation should be the most obvious relics of first - order phase transitions that may have existed in the history of the universe .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these results represent the first 3-dimensional simulations of first - order cosmological phase transitions and the highest - resolution lattice gravitational wave predictions to date .    using these simulations , without a coupled fluid and with only scalar degrees of freedom ,",
    "we have confirmed previous analytic and numerical simulations of gravity waves from first - order processes , and have reproduced the predicted scalings of the results both in frequency and amplitude .",
    "we had identified the two relevant stages of the process : ( 1 ) the stage during which the bubbles collide and ( 2 ) a coalescence phase during with the field settles into the true vacuum . during the first stage , we precisely reproduce the location of the peak of gravitational radiation from previous estimates . the amplitude at this time is lower than expected from these estimates , due to the inclusion of friction and by realistically  thickening \" the walls .",
    "primarily , though , we have discovered that a coalescence phase following the phase transition amplifies the gravitational wave signal for a first - order phase transition by about an order of magnitude and increases the peak frequency by about a decade .",
    "this is most likely a consequence of the persistence of energy in domain walls , even after regions have collided , e.g. @xcite , residual anisotropic stress - energy produced as the universe relaxes to a thermal state .",
    "this compensates for the lack of power in gravity waves at @xmath141 .",
    "the electroweak phase transition will occur at a much lower frequency than those presented here .",
    "if we estimate this energy scale as @xmath142 , then we expect the peak frequency of gravitational radiation from the phase transition to occur at a few times @xmath143 , assuming @xmath144 as we have here .",
    "coalescence will both amplify the signal and raise the peak frequency about an order of magnitude .",
    "we believe that this is an important effect to be considered in the next generation of detector experiments .",
    "we intend to follow up on this model by adding dynamical fluids to our 3-dimensional simulations .",
    "the evolution of fluids alongside our scalar fields will allow us to confirm the parametric dependence of the gravitational wave signal on the terminal velocity of the bubble walls , check for the amplification of the signal due to the existence of turbulence and confirm that a coalescence phase exists in the presence of a viscous fluid .",
