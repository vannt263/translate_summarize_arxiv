    "transverse spin and transverse momentum of quarks and/or hadrons correlate with each other in various ways , giving rise to a number of transverse - momentum dependent distributions ( tmd s ) , some of which are leading - twist quantities .",
    "tmd s manifest themselves in single - spin and azimuthal asymmetries in partially inclusive hard processes @xcite . in the last decade , semiinclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) experiments ( hermes , compass , clas ) have investigated these observables and shown that they are non vanishing and relatively sizable .",
    "most of the phenomenological work focuses on three distributions functions : the transversity distribution @xmath0 , the boer - mulders function @xmath1 ( spin asymmetry of transversely polarized quarks inside an unpolarized target ) and the sivers function @xmath2 ( azimuthal asymmetry of unpolarized quarks inside a transversely polarized nucleon ) .",
    "the first two combine in sidis with the collins fragmentation function @xmath3 , which describes the fragmentation of transversely polarized quarks into an unpolarized hadron .",
    "the processes considered by present phenomenological analyses are : @xmath4 ( collins and sivers effects with different angular distributions ) , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( boer - mulders effect ) , @xmath7 ( collins effect ) .",
    "the parton - model expressions of the sidis structure functions involving the three tmd s mentioned above are & & f_ut^(_h + _ s ) = c + sivers & & f_ut , t^(_h - _ s ) = c + boer - mulders & & f_uu^2 _ h = c where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the transverse momentum of the incoming ( fragmenting ) quark , the apices indicate the azimuthal modulation ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the azimuthal angles of the final hadron and of the target spin , respectively ) and @xmath12 is a convolution in the transverse momentum space .",
    "tmd s are usually written as factorized functions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and their transverse - momentum dependence is often assumed to have a gaussian form .",
    "a typical parametrization for the sivers and the boer - mulders functions is f_1t^(x , k_t^2 ) , h_1^ ( x , k_t^2 ) ~x^ ( 1 - x)^ ^- k_t^2/ k_t^2 f_1(x ) , [ param ] where @xmath15 is the ordinary number density . due to the kinematics of current experiments and to the structure of sidis observables , high-@xmath13 tails and antiquark distributions are at present largely unconstrained .    a combined analysis of the sidis data on the collins asymmetry from hermes and compass , and of the @xmath16 belle data ,",
    "was performed by anselmino et al . @xcite and led to the first extraction of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 transversity distributions , which turned out to have opposite signs , with @xmath19 smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "the sivers asymmetry has been measured by hermes and compass and phenomenologically studied in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the resulting sivers functions for @xmath17 and @xmath18 have comparable magnitudes and opposite signs ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath23 asymmetry in unpolarized sidis at small transverse momentum provides information on the boer - mulders function . in @xcite",
    "it was predicted that the @xmath24 asymmetry should be larger than the @xmath25 asymmetry , as a consequence of the boer - mulders effect .",
    "this prediction has been substantially confirmed by the experimental results .",
    "a fit to the hermes @xcite and compass @xcite preliminary data has been performed in @xcite .",
    "it assumes that @xmath26 can be described by the leading - twist boer - mulders component and by the so - called cahn term @xcite f_uu , cahn^2 _ h = c which is however only part of the full twist-4 contribution , still unknown .",
    "as the available data do not allow a complete determination of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 dependence of @xmath27 , the boer - mulders functions are simply taken to be proportional to the sivers functions of @xcite , @xmath28 , and the parameters @xmath29 are obtained from the fit .",
    "the result , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , is consistent with expectations from the impact - parameter picture and lattice qcd . the comparison with the data is shown in fig .  [ fig_costwophi ] .",
    "the @xmath32 asymmetry has been measured also in unpolarized drell - yan ( dy ) production , where it is represented by the so - called @xmath33 parameter . at small @xmath34",
    "this quantity is dominated by the boer - mulders contribution and is given by = , w_uu^2 = c .",
    "the e866/nusea collaboration at fnal has presented results for the @xmath33 asymmetry in @xmath35 @xcite and @xmath36 @xcite collisions , from which one can get some information on the antiquark boer - mulders distributions .",
    "the analysis of the sidis @xmath37 distribution has been extended to the corresponding dy observable in @xcite .",
    "the quality of the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_dy ] . the combined sidis and dy analysis allows determining both the magnitude and the sign of the quark and antiquark distributions .",
    "in spite of its important achievements , the phenomenology of tmd s is still in its infancy .",
    "the mature stage will be represented by truly global analyses . these should : _",
    "i ) _ incorporate the exact evolution of tmd s ; _ ii ) _ take all perturbative and non - perturbative effects into account and fit simultaneously polarized and unpolarized cross sections ; _ iii ) _ use datasets with larger statistics and wider kinematics .",
    "more sidis data are expected from jlab and from future facilities ( eic ) , but in the short - to - medium term the main improvement will come from polarized dy measurements : compass ( @xmath38 ) , panda ( @xmath39 ) , pax ( @xmath40 ) , j - parc , nica , rhic ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "a list of dy observables is ( @xmath42 is the azimuthal angle of dileptons in the collins - soper frame )    * @xmath43 + driven by valence .",
    "expected to be large ( 10 - 15% ) , but involves the boer - mulders function of the pion .",
    "* @xmath44 + driven by valence .",
    "the @xmath45 asymmetry probes the sivers function of the proton ( the unpolarized distribution of the pion is fairly well known ) . *",
    "@xmath46 + involves the sea .",
    "known to be small ( few percent ) .",
