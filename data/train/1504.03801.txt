    "in heavy - ion fusion reactions at energies around the coulomb barrier , low - lying collective excitations of the colliding nuclei during fusion process plays an important role in enhancing fusion cross sections as compared to a prediction of a simple potential model @xcite .",
    "these effects have usually been taken into account in the coupled - channels calculations with a coupling scheme based on a harmonic vibrator for spherical nuclei or on a rigid rotor for deformed nuclei @xcite . with this approach ,",
    "the energy of the first excited state as well as the coupling strength from the ground state to the first excited state , which can be taken from the experimental data , specify all the other excitation energies and coupling strengths for higher members in the coupling scheme .",
    "typical examples which show the subbarrier enhancement of fusion cross sections include the fusion of @xmath0ni+@xmath1ni and @xmath3ni+@xmath3ni , for which multi - phonon excitations have been shown to play an important role @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for discussions on multi - phonon excitations .",
    "multiple excitations within the ground state rotational band also play an important role in most of fusion reactions involved with heavy deformed nuclei @xcite .    in reality , however , most of atomic nuclei have neither a pure harmonic oscillator spectrum nor a pure rigid body rotational band .",
    "for example , the @xmath0ni nucleus , which has usually been considered to be a typical vibrational nucleus , does not exhibit a level spectrum characteristic to the harmonic vibration , that is , the degeneracy of the two - phonon triplet is considerably broken . moreover",
    ", a recent theoretical calculation based on a multi - reference density functional theory with the skyrme interaction also indicates that the @xmath4 strengths among the collective levels in @xmath0ni deviate largely from what are expected from a simple harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to investigate the role of anharmonicity , that is , the deviation from the harmonic limit , in subbarrier fusion of @xmath0ni .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the effect of anharmonicity on subbarrier fusion of @xmath5o+@xmath6sm has been investigated using the vibrational limit of interacting boson model ( ibm ) .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an application of this method to large - angle quasi - elastic scattering of the @xmath5o+@xmath7sm system .",
    "although the static quadrupole moment of the first excited state could be successfully extracted by analyzing the high precision experimental data with this approach @xcite , the application of ibm has several limitations for a global study .",
    "firstly , the method is not applicable to doubly magic nuclei , as the number of bosons in ibm is estimated from the number of valence nucleons outside shell closures .",
    "secondly , phenomenological parameters have to be introduced to the model hamiltonian and to the transition operators .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop an alternative microscopic approach for nuclear collective excitations , which does not rely on the harmonic limit or the rigid rotor , in order to systematically investigate the effect of collective excitations in general on subbarrier fusion reactions in a wide mass region .    in this paper , we employ a beyond - mean - field method to describe low - lying collective excitations and combine it with the coupled - channels approach to heavy - ion fusion reactions .",
    "the pure mean - field approximation breaks the rotational symmetry and does not yield a spectrum of nuclei .",
    "this can be overcome by going beyond the mean - field approximation , in particular , by carrying out the angular momentum projection .",
    "one can also take into account the quantum fluctuation of the mean - field wave function by superposing many slater determinants with the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "when the pairing correlation is important , the particle number projection can also be implemented .",
    "such scheme has been referred to as a multi - reference density - functional theory ( mr - dft ) , and has rapidly been developed in the nuclear structure physics for the past decade @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the coupled - channels approach for heavy - ion sub - barrier fusion reactions . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results of mr - dft calculations for the @xmath0ni and @xmath1ni nuclei . to this end",
    ", we use the covariant density functional theory ( cdft ) , based on the relativistic framework . in sec .",
    "iv , we combine the coupled - channels calculations with the mr - cdft approach . we apply this method to subbarrier fusion reactions of @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni , @xmath0ni+@xmath1ni , and @xmath2ca+@xmath0ni systems , and discuss the role of anharmonicity of quadrupole vibrations of @xmath0ni and @xmath1ni .",
    "we then summarize the paper in sec .",
    "our aim in this paper is to solve coupled - channels equations using inputs from the mr - cdft calculations . in principle",
    ", one could formulate the coupled - channels method fully microscopically using the mr - cdft method .",
    "in such approach , the internuclear potentials , both for the diagonal and the coupling parts , would be constructed by folding an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction with calculated density distributions and transition densities @xcite .",
    "it has been known , however , that this double folding procedure fails to work for heavy - ion subbarrier fusion reactions @xcite .",
    "that is , one obtains a surface diffuseness parameter of around @xmath8 0.63 fm when a double folding potential is fitted with a woods - saxon function , whereas experimental fusion cross sections systematically require a much larger value , _",
    "e.g. , _ @xmath8 1.0 fm @xcite .",
    "an important fact to notice is that the double folding method works only in the surface region of the potential . for elastic and inelastic scattering , the surface region of the potential",
    "is mainly probed and a double folding potential is reasonable @xcite . in marked contrast , fusion reactions involve both the surface and the inner regions , where two nuclei appreciably overlap with each other . as a consequence ,",
    "several dynamical effects are important in the inner region @xcite , and the double folding potential looses its validity .",
    "another problem of the fully microscopic formulation is that the mr - cdft calculations seldom yield a perfect agreement with experimental data for excitation energies and transition strengths , even though an overall agreement is often reasonable . on the other hand , in order to describe quantitatively heavy - ion fusion reactions at energies close to the coulomb barrier , it is important to use reasonable values for excitation energies and transition strengths .    in order to avoid these drawbacks of the fully microscopic approach , in this paper we employ a semi - microscopic approach .",
    "that is , we use a phenomenological woods - saxon internuclear potential and adopt the experimental value for the coupling strength between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "the coupling strengths for higher members are not known well in many nuclei , and it is for these values that we employ the mr - cdft calculations , after scaling the calculated values with the experimental strength for the transition between the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "the excitation energies are known for most of the collective levels , and we simply use the experimental values whenever they are available .    in the coupled - channels approach to subbarrier fusion reactions , one expands the total wave function of the system in terms of the eigen - functions of the collective states in the target nucleus , @xmath9 , as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the relative coordinate between the colliding nuclei , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the angular momentum for the target state and the angular momentum for the relative motion , respectively . here , for simplicity of notation , we have assumed that the projectile nucleus is inert , but an extension is straightforward to the case where both the projectile and the target nuclei are excited .",
    "we have also introduced the isocentrifugal approximation @xcite , and have assumed that the angular momentum for the relative motion does not change by the excitation of the target nucleus .",

    "a similar conclusion has been reached also with the non - relativistic dft @xcite .",

    "the calculated @xmath4 values shown in figs .  [ ni58spectra ] and  [ ni60spectra ] , together with the strong transition from the 2@xmath100 to the 0@xmath100 states , indicate a presence of large anharmonicity in the quadrupole vibrations in @xmath0ni and @xmath1ni .",

    "this fact also implies that the present approach for fusion reactions with mr - cdft provides a natural truncation scheme in the coupled - channels calculations , whereas the truncation of the phonon spectrum has to be introduced in an ad - hoc way if one employs the harmonic oscillator couplings .",
    "another clear indication of anharmonicity is a finite value of quadrupole moment of the first 2@xmath106 state .",

    "<S> we describe low - lying collective excitations of atomic nuclei with the multi - reference covariant density functional theory , and combine them with coupled - channels calculations for heavy - ion fusion reactions at energies around the coulomb barrier . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we use the calculated transition strengths among several collective states as inputs to the coupled - channels calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides a natural way to describe anharmonic multi - phonon excitations as well as a deviation of rotational excitations from a simple rigid rotor . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this method to subbarrier fusion reactions of @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni , @xmath0ni+@xmath1ni and @xmath2ca+@xmath0ni systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effect of anharmonicity tends to smear the fusion barrier distributions , better reproducing the experimental data compared to the calculations in the harmonic oscillator limit . </S>"
