    "the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) is one of the largest known structures in the local universe @xcite .",
    "recent measurements based on the tully - fisher relation give @xmath5 for the hubble flow recession velocity of a3558 , one of the central clusters in the ssc @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a redshift of @xmath6 , a luminosity distance of @xmath7 , and an angular diameter distance of @xmath8 . despite the great distance of the ssc , it has recently been argued that the ssc contributes significantly to the peculiar velocity of the local group ( lg ) based on the enhanced abundance of x - ray clusters in it @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the ssc to the lg peculiar velocity depends critically on the mean matter density in the supercluster .",
    "it is a non - trivial matter to relate the enhanced abundance of massive x - ray clusters in the region to its overdensity , since clusters are strongly biased with respect to the underlying distribution of matter @xcite .",
    "because x - ray clusters correspond to rare density peaks , even mild enhancements in the mean matter density can result in the formation of many more clusters within the supercluster .",
    "since this bias depends on the cluster mass , the relationship between a sample containing objects in a range of masses and the underlying matter can not be described accurately by a constant bias factor .    in this paper",
    "we study the dependence of the number of x - ray clusters in the ssc on the underlying matter overdensity in this region .",
    "we use the hybrid model proposed by @xcite  combining the extended press - schechter ( eps ) formalism @xcite with the structure formation prescription of @xcite ( st ) .",
    "the model describes well published results from numerical simulations ( see discussion around fig .",
    "4 of @xcite ) . using the mass - dependent , nonlinear bias for x - ray clusters ,",
    "we calculate the matter overdensity in the ssc region from the number of observed x - ray clusters there .    in  [ method ] , we describe how the @xcite hybrid model can be used to calculate the mass in a large region enclosing collapsed objects .",
    "we then specifically consider the ssc in  [ clusters ] and describe the sample of x - ray clusters used in our calculation . in  [ ssc ] we apply our formalism and calculate the matter overdensity , cluster overdensity , cluster bias , and total mass in the ssc region .",
    "given these results , we then use the spherical collapse model in  [ dynamics ] to consider the dynamics of the region . in  [ pecvel ]",

    "according to the eps prescription @xcite , if the linear density fluctuations in the universe are extrapolated to their values today and smoothed on a comoving radius @xmath11 , a point whose overdensity exceeds a critical value of @xmath12 , belongs to a collapsed object with a mass @xmath13 if @xmath11 is the largest scale for which the criterion is met . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the linear growth factor at redshift @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the closure density of the universe , and @xmath17 is the matter density parameter today .",
    "the critical value of the overdensity is also known as the _ barrier_. for a gaussian random field of initial density perturbations , as indicated by measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the probability distribution of the extrapolated and smoothed over - density , @xmath18 , is also a gaussian : @xmath19 with zero mean and a variance given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the linear power - spectrum of density fluctuations today as a function of comoving wave - number @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . since equation ( [ var ] )",
    "is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath11 ( or @xmath24 ) , the smoothing scale can be uniquely specified by the variance of the over - density field smoothed on that scale .",

    "it assumes no prior knowledge of the overdensity on a given scale .",
    "if we fix the average linear overdensity to be @xmath38 in a region smoothed on a particular scale , @xmath39 , we can generate a conditional mass function with a conditional form of @xmath40 . in eps ,",
    "this can be done by substituting @xmath41 and @xmath42 and gives results that agree well with simulations .",
    "the same substitution with @xmath43 , however , does not agree as well .",

    "[ sample ]    when applying this formalism to observations , there is an additional complication in that overdensities and the sizes of regions are observed in eulerian coordinates which evolve as the region breaks away from the hubble flow , while the eps and st prescriptions rely on initial values in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "lagrangian sizes in the comoving frame do not change over time . as in @xcite , we use the spherical evolution model to calculate the lagrangian size , @xmath68 , corresponding to the observed eulerian size , @xmath69 , of a region containing the linear overdensity , @xmath38 in a @xmath70 universe .",

    "similarly , a lower value of the overdensity would mean that the material inside @xmath69 came from a relatively smaller lagrangian size . integrating the equations of motion results in a mapping between the comoving eulerian size of a viewed region and the comoving lagrangian size of the region from where the same material originated in the early universe .",

    "to calculate the mass and overdensity described in the previous section for the ssc , we need to know the number of the collapsed objects in the ssc , their minimum mass , and the size of the region in which they reside .",
    "since the mass function given by eps and similar prescriptions ignores substructure , we must be careful to consider only the largest structures .",

    "we consider the most massive , x - ray luminous clusters in the supercluster as tracers of the most massive halos and make the assumption that each halo hosts one such cluster .",
    "this is a good approximation given how well the average st halo mass function in the universe matches the cluster mass function @xcite .",
    "our tendency to focus on only the rarest objects is moderated by the need to reduce poisson fluctuations on our sample .    to balance these requirements",

    "this is nearly equivalent to assuming no relative peculiar velocity among the clusters . as we will see in  [ dynamics ] this approximation is adequate for our purposes .",

    ", we ignore the effect of the cluster selection function .",
    "the flux of our dimmest cluster is bright enough to be seen even in regions where rosat sensitivity is slightly lower ( i.e. in the @xmath103 patch centered at ( ra : dec)@xmath104(199.295:-34.393 ) ) .",
    "however , absorption by the galaxy could hide a few additional clusters . on the other hand , because the core of the ssc is clearly more overdense than the region out to @xmath105 , our assumption that each cluster represents one halo may not hold there .",
    "multiple clusters in the core may lie within a single halo ( or multiple halos in the process of merging ) .",
    "thus , the number of halos may be somewhat different than the @xmath86 we assume .",
    "our analysis , however , is independent of the individual masses of these halos and depends only on the minimum halo mass of our sample and the total number of halos .",
    "because the error in our mass measurements is only @xmath106 , errors in the minimum mass can be described by additional error in the number of clusters being above a fixed threshold .",
    "in addition , we expect the variation in @xmath50 due to errors in @xmath66 to be small .",
    "if it turns out that all of our mass estimates are systematically @xmath106 too high , then only two clusters below the limit would have made it into our sample undeserved . in  [ robust ] ,",

    "] is given by @xcite @xmath205 where @xmath206 and @xmath207 and @xmath208 point from the center of the ssc to each ssc mass element and to the lg , respectively . because we do not explore the mass distribution within the ssc , we assume a constant value of the overdensity out to @xmath105 . the distribution of values for @xmath112 , reflecting the distribution in the ssc overdensity , is plotted in panel ( i ) of figure  [ dist ] .",
    "we find @xmath209 , only @xmath210 of the @xmath211 peculiar velocity of the lg with respect to the cmb @xcite .",
    "this is much less than the value estimated by @xcite of @xmath212 .",
    "even @xmath139 and the corresponding value of @xmath213 ( see  [ ssc ] ) produce only @xmath214 , but this is almost @xmath215 from our mean value .",
    "thus , we agree qualitatively with @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that the ssc does not contribute very significantly to the peculiar velocity of the lg .",
    "the number of clusters in our sample decreases sharply with radius from the center of the ssc , and the clusters are not numerous enough to adequately sample the entire volume of the ssc .",
    "nonetheless , we can obtain some interesting estimates about the radial distribution of the quantities we investigate by considering subsamples of clusters from table  [ sample ] with distances from the center of the ssc within varying values of @xmath69 .",
    "figure  [ rprofile ] shows the radial profiles we calculate for the number of observed clusters , the matter overdensity and the amount of excess mass within @xmath69 as functions of @xmath69 .",
    "also shown are the peculiar velocity of the lg due to the overdensity contained within @xmath69 and the radial peculiar velocity of the shell with radius @xmath69 centered on a3558 .",
    "the plot of @xmath50 vs. @xmath69 depicts a step - like function where the value changes in discrete steps as observed clusters from the table  [ sample ] become included in the subsample within @xmath69 .",
    "the discreteness of the limited sample is manifested in the sharp transitions exhibited in the radial profiles of the other quantities in figure  [ rprofile ] .",
    "the true profiles are smooth curves that roughly follow those calculated and are bounded by the @xmath216 error brackets approximately @xmath217 of the time despite the sharp transitions . the uncertainty in the values of @xmath141 , the distance between each cluster and a3558 , shown in table  [ sample ] , is not included in the errors plotted in the figure .    since @xmath218 , the plots of @xmath109 and @xmath203 vs. @xmath69 are analogous , however , they illustrate two different points .",
    "the radial profile of @xmath109 shows a roughly power - law rise in the overdensity as we move toward the center of the ssc .",
    "the supercluster becomes quite nonlinear in the region interior to @xmath219 .",
    "the radial profile of @xmath203 , on the other hand , demonstrates that the mass only rises significantly through sharp jumps that correspond to the adding of additional clusters to the subsample .",
    "this can also be seen in the plot of @xmath112 vs. @xmath69 where the profile between jumps is extremely flat . moreover , while the contribution to the peculiar velocity of the lg rises most rapidly between @xmath220 and @xmath221 , @xmath112 seems to have leveled off by @xmath222 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath113 with @xmath69 is very mild with its mean varying by only a factor of @xmath223 over the full range of @xmath69 shown .",
    "in addition , the @xmath134 errors on @xmath113 are large , comparable to the range over which @xmath113 varies . however , it is clear that the general trend is toward increasingly negative values of @xmath113 as we move toward the center of the ssc .",
    "this is what is expected from the spherical collapse model .",
    "in addition , by tracing the future of regions at different radii with the spherical collapse model ( see  [ collapse ] ) , we determine that the ssc is only a closed system at @xmath224 given the mean of the density probability distribution and at @xmath225 if @xmath134 fluctuations are considered .",
    "the mass enclosed within this radius is comparable to that of a rich x - ray cluster of @xmath226 .",
    "the trajectories of spheres with @xmath227 , @xmath158 , @xmath157 , and @xmath156 are plotted in figure  [ collpro ] .",
    "the mean values of the overdensity for each of these radii have been adopted in plotting the trajectories .",
    "in  [ method ] , we showed how the matter overdensity in a region can be determined by fitting the mass function in an overdense region to the cluster mass function in the region .",
    "however , because of our limited sample , we only fit the normalization of the mass function and relied on the @xcite hybrid model to correctly fit the slope . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the robustness of our results and their dependence on our sample . in  [ nrobust ] , we consider the choice of @xmath50 obtained from the sample , while in  [ hmrobust ] , we turn our attention to the slope of the mass function and ask whether different mass bins within the sample give consistent results .     the dependence of the distributions for the nonlinear overdensity , @xmath109 , the total mass of the ssc , @xmath24 , the cluster bias , @xmath111 , the contribution of the ssc to the peculiar velocity of the lg , @xmath112 , and the radial peculiar velocity of the outer edge of the ssc , @xmath113 , on the value of @xmath50 .",
    "the square points represent the mean values of the probability distributions , while the error bars show the @xmath216 spread .",
    "the vertical line denotes @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath228 and @xmath229 are held fixed for all values of @xmath50 . ]",
    "the probability distributions of the matter overdensity , @xmath109 , ( upper panel ) and the cluster bias , @xmath111 , ( lower panel ) obtained with four different cluster subsamples from table  [ sample ] .",
    "the solid curve shows the results from the entire sample of @xmath86 clusters with masses above @xmath230 shown in figure  [ pdel ] .",
    "the dotted curve shows the results obtained using the @xmath89 clusters with masses above @xmath231 , while the @xmath232 clusters with masses above @xmath233 produced the results denoted by the dashed curve .",
    "finally , the results denoted by the long - dashed curve were derived with only the @xmath234 clusters with host halo masses above @xmath235 .",
    "the size of the region was fixed at @xmath229 for each distribution . ]",
    "the number of collapsed halos , their minimum mass , and their extent are the three key parameters that we extract from our cluster sample for use in our structure formation analysis .",
    "though it is probably correct to identify the number of x - ray luminous clusters with the number of collapsed halos , the two may not be exactly equivalent .",
    "in addition , there may be undiscovered objects obscured by galactic absorption . as argued in  [ clusters ] ,",
    "the error in the mass estimates of each halo from the cluster x - ray properties can be expressed as an additional but small error in the number of halos above a fixed threshold .",
    "the same can be said for the extent of the ssc , denoted @xmath69 .",
    "small errors in the physical position of a cluster with respect to the center of the ssc can be represented as clusters being falsely included or excluded in our fixed selection of @xmath69 .",
    "we thus explore the dependence of our results on the assumed number of collapsed halos .",
    "figure  [ neffect ] shows the mean values of @xmath109 , @xmath111 , @xmath24 , @xmath113 , and @xmath112 from figure  [ dist ] , as well as the @xmath134 errors for different choices of @xmath50 . as @xmath50 changes , @xmath107 and @xmath69 are held fixed at the values assumed throughout this paper .",
    "the results clearly do not change much as @xmath50 is varied over a relatively wide range of values .      checking",
    "the fit of the mass function explicitly is equivalent to asking whether samples with higher mass thresholds give consistent results for the overdensity in the ssc .",
    "since there are many more lower mass objects than higher mass ones , significant deviations in the number of higher mass objects may not affect the results obtained using all of the clusters .",
    "however , consistency between multiple mass bins shows that the results do not depend on the particular choices we made for our sample .",
    "the probability distributions for the matter overdensity and the cluster bias are shown in figure  [ hmbins ] calculated using each of four different mass thresholds .",
    "these distributions are not completely independent because the lower mass thresholds include all of the objects at higher mass . however , since there is a steep drop - off in the number of objects with mass , the distributions are dominated by objects near the mass threshold .",
    "all four mass thresholds give consistent results for the matter overdensity in the ssc , with the distributions clustered around @xmath236 , slightly higher than the mean of the @xmath228 distribution .",
    "it is important to note that the mass threshold does not correlate with mean overdensity .",
    "this is just what we would expect if there is no bias in the number of objects with mass since , according to the model , a single value of the average linear matter overdensity should describe the entire mass function .    on the other hand",
    ", we do expect a correlation between the bias and the mass of the objects in the sample .",
    "the figure clearly show this correlation as the mean of each bias distribution increases with the mass threshold .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that more massive clusters are more strongly clustered than less massive ones .",
    "we have used the enhanced abundance of x - ray clusters to calculate the mass in the ssc , based on the eps - st model @xcite .",
    "we constructed a sample of @xmath86 x - ray luminous clusters within a radius of @xmath237 in halos with masses above @xmath228 .",
    "we then calculated probability distributions for the matter density contrast of the ssc region , the cluster bias for our sample , and the mass of the ssc .",
    "we demonstrated that even mild values of the overdensity in a region can result in a significant over - abundance of massive clusters .",
    "we found a mass of @xmath238 for the ssc .",
    "our results are in good agreement with previous results @xcite , though we found that the cluster bias is probably higher than that estimated by @xcite .",
    "we then used the spherical collapse model to investigate the dynamics of the ssc .",
    "we found that the comoving size of the region has only collapsed by about @xmath239 from its initial value .",
    "moreover , we concluded that the ssc is not bound at a radius of @xmath237 , despite the significant mass in the region .",
    "the repulsive effect of the cosmological constant provides the extra push against gravity that will keep the region from ever collapsing .",
    "the outer shell is moving radially away from the center with a velocity only @xmath240 slower than the @xmath241 hubble velocity at that radius .",
    "this prediction could be tested with better tully - fisher data from ssc galaxies , or future cmb observations .",
    "we also calculated the contribution of the ssc to the peculiar velocity of the lg , @xmath209 .",
    "this value amounts to only @xmath210 of the lg peculiar motion , much smaller than a recent estimate by @xcite and more in agreement with @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    despite the uncertainty in investigating the interior of the ssc using smaller subsamples of cluster , exploring the radial profiles of @xmath109 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 indicated convergence , i.e. that we have included all of the mass in the region in excess of the universal average that contributes to the peculiar velocity of the lg .",
    "moreover , while the @xmath1 region as a whole is only mildly nonlinear , the interior of the ssc becomes highly nonlinear .",
    "the excess mass becomes enough to bind the sphere with radius only @xmath242 .",
    "finally , we showed that our results are robust to errors in our input parameters and the mass threshold of our cluster sample .",
    "subsamples of clusters with different mass thresholds give consistent results for the overdensity in the region and demonstrate an expected increase in bias with mass .",
