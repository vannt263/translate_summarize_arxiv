    "elements heavier than the iron group comprise a miniscule fraction of all atoms by number or mass , but they comprise approximately 70  per cent of the stable or long - lived isotopes found naturally on earth .",
    "the rapid neutron - capture process , also known as the , is one of the two general nucleosynthesis mechanisms responsible for production of most isotopes heavier than the iron group @xcite .",
    "two decades ago , observations of the metal - poor star ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath53.1 ) revealed a surprising consistency between its heavy - element abundance pattern and the predicted  component of the solar system distribution @xcite . over the next decade ,",
    "three other stars were found with similar abundance patterns ( , @xcite ; , @xcite ; and , @xcite ) , and since then tens more have been identified ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ratios of heavy elements to fe ( e.g. , [ eu / fe ] ) in many of these stars are an order of magnitude larger than in the solar system , and this is one of two defining characteristics of the `` @xmath0-ii '' class of stars @xcite .",
    "( the other defining characteristic is that the star has [ ba / eu ]  @xmath6  0 . )",
    "the existence of this  pattern in metal - poor stars nearly as old as the universe itself was not predicted by theory , and the stellar sites responsible for  nucleosynthesis are still debated today .    our use of the phrase _  nucleosynthesis _ refers to the generic process described by @xcite:``a large flux of neutrons becomes available in a short time interval for addition to elements of the iron group '' ( p.  587 ) .",
    "that which produces the predicted  abundance pattern in solar system material is the so - called _ main component _ of the .",
    "this is what @xcite  were trying to reproduce with their analytic description , even though it would be another 16  years before others would attempt to separate the  contribution explicitly from the slow neutron - capture ( ) contribution in the solar system total isotopic distribution @xcite .",
    "the @xcite  definition is , however , sufficiently flexible to account for the `` incomplete  synthesis '' ( @xcite , p.  1305 ) abundance pattern , or so - called _ weak component _",
    ", found in many other metal - poor stars and exemplified by ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the patterns typical of the main and weak components may represent the extremes of a range of  nucleosynthesis outcomes that depend on the physical conditions at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "they may also represent two distinct processes @xcite .",
    "abundance patterns intermediate between these two extremes are found , and the full range spans at least @xmath70.5  @xmath2  [ eu / fe ]  @xmath31.9 ( e.g. , sneden , cowan , & gallino @xcite ) .",
    "this can be illustrated , for example , with the [ sr / ba ] ratio in @xmath8  100  stars as shown in in figure  17 of @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the same effect is shown for many elements in 16  stars in figure  11 of @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "also find these intermediate values in their samples of metal - poor stars with various levels of  enhancement ( see their figures  15 and 28 , respectively ) .",
    "phenomenological chemical evolution models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and physically - motivated  calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) can reproduce the observed distributions .",
    "these explanations , however , are not uniquely capable of predicting the range of [ sr / ba ] ratios in low metallicity stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the literature ,",
    "references to _ the _ frequently refer to the event producing the main component pattern .",
    "observations indicating that the  is a rare event and those indicating the nearly - ubiquitous presence of  material in stars are not mutually exclusive .",
    "abundance patterns like that found in the star  are rare , and so presumably the nucleosynthesis events that produce them are also rare .",
    "the greater concentration of stars with [ ba / fe ] and [ ba / sr ]  @xmath6  0 and low [ c / fe ] ratios in figure  7 of @xcite indicates that stars with these characteristics , like , are not rare ( cf .",
    "thus the  events that give rise to these patterns are probably not rare , either .",
    "in this paper we present nine new members of the class of stars highly - enhanced in  material . until recent years",
    "the members of this class included only evolved red giants , as summarized by @xcite .",
    "this understandably led to concern that perhaps the consistent  pattern observed in some metal - poor stars was an artifact of the analysis or related to physics of the stellar photospheres rather than nucleosynthesis .",
    "the one exception is a faint main sequence dwarf identified by @xcite .",
    "the nine stars presented here are subgiants ( including stars at the main - sequence turn - off , msto ) and the field - star equivalents of red horizontal branch ( rhb ) stars .",
    "these stars have been identified among the metal - poor candidates presented by beers , preston , & shectman ( @xcite ) and analyzed in detail by @xcite .",

    "abundance ratios for elements x and y compare the total abundances of x and y derived from like ionization states ; i.e. , neutrals with neutrals and ions with ions .",
    "we draw our sample from the catalog of 313 metal - poor stars observed and analyzed by @xcite .",
    "we adopt a traditional indicator of  enrichment to select stars highly - enhanced in  material , the [ eu / fe ] ratio . the @xcite  study included four red giants previously identified as being highly - enhanced in  material , , , , and .",

    "<S> ( 1 ) high levels of @xmath0-process enhancement are found in a broad range of stellar evolutionary states , reaffirming that this phenomenon is not associated with a chemical peculiarity of red giant atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) only 1 of 10  stars observed at multiple epochs shows radial velocity variations , reaffirming that stars with high levels of @xmath0-process enhancement are not preferentially found among binaries . ( 3 ) only 2 of the 13  stars are highly - enhanced in c and n , indicating that there is no connection between high levels of @xmath0-process enhancement and high levels of c and n. ( 4 ) the dispersions in [ sr / ba ] and [ sr / eu ] are larger than the dispersions in [ ba / eu ] and [ yb / eu ] , suggesting that the elements below the second @xmath0-process peak do not always scale with those in the rare earth domain , even within the class of highly-@xmath0-process - enhanced stars . ( 5 ) the light - element ( 12  @xmath4  30 ) abundances of highly-@xmath0-process - enhanced stars are indistinguishable from those with normal levels of @xmath0-process material at the limit of our data , 3.5  per cent ( 0.015  dex ) on average . the nucleosynthetic sites responsible for the large @xmath0-process enhancements did not produce any detectable light - element abundance signatures distinct from normal core - collapse supernovae .
