    "these problems are notoriously difficult due to the inherently two - way nature of poromechanical coupling , where deformation drives flow and vice - versa .    in poroelasticity , the mechanics of the solid skeleton are described by elasticity theory .",

    "@xcite provides an excellent discussion of the historical roots of linear poroelasticy , which models poroelastic loading under infinitesimal deformations .",

    "large - deformation ( poro)elasticity is traditionally approached almost exclusively with computational tools , and these are based almost exclusively on the finite - element method and in a lagrangian framework  ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "a thorough treatment of the lagrangian approach to large - deformation poroelasticity can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although powerful , these tools can be cumbersome from the perspective of developing physical insight .",
    "they are also poorly suited for studying nontrivial flow and solute transport through the pore structure . here",
    ", we instead consider the general theory of large - deformation poroelasticity in an eulerian framework .",
    "although the eulerian approach is well known ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ?",
    "* ) , it has very rarely been applied to practical problems and a clear and unified presentation is lacking .",
    "this approach is useful in the present context to emphasize the physics of poromechanical coupling .    in the first part of this paper , we review and discuss the well - known theory  (  [ s : poroelasticity][s : linearporoelasticity ] ) .",
    "we first consider the exact description of the kinematics of flow and deformation , adopting a simple but nonlinear elastic response in the solid skeleton  (  [ s : poroelasticity ] ) .",
    "we then show how this theory reduces to linear poroelasticity in the limit of infinitesimal deformations  (  [ s : linearporoelasticity ] ) .",
    "in the second part of this paper , we compare the linear and large - deformation theories in the context of two uniaxial model problems  (  [ s : rect][s : flow_rect ] ) .",
    "the primary goals of this comparison are to study the role of kinematic nonlinearity in large deformations , and to examine the resulting error in the linear theory .",
    "the two model problems are : ( i )  compression driven by an applied load ( the consolidation problem ) and ( ii )  compression driven by a net fluid throughflow . in the former ,",
    "the evolution of the deformation is controlled by the rate at which fluid is squeezed through the material and out at the boundaries ; as a result , fluid flow is central to the rate of deformation but plays no role in the steady state . in the latter ,",
    "fluid flow is also central to the steady state since this is set by the steady balance between the gradient in fluid pressure and the gradient in stress within the solid skeleton .",
    "we show that , in both cases , the error in linear poroelasticity due to the missing kinematic nonlinearities plays a surprisingly important role in the dynamics of the deformation , and that this error is amplified by nonlinear constitutive behavior such as deformation - dependent permeability .",
    "poroelasticity is a multiphase theory in that it describes the coexistence and interaction of multiple immiscible constituent materials , or phases  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    ", we restrict ourselves to two phases : a solid and a fluid .",
    "the solid phase is arranged into a porous and deformable macroscopic structure , `` the solid skeleton '' or `` the skeleton '' , and the pore space of the solid skeleton is saturated with a single interstitial fluid .",
    "deformation of the solid skeleton leads to rearrangement of its pore structure , with corresponding changes in the local volume fractions ( see  [ ss : volumefractions ] ) . throughout",
    ", we use the terms `` the solid grains '' or `` the solid '' to refer to the solid phase and `` the interstitial fluid '' or `` the fluid '' to refer to the fluid phase .",
    "although the term `` grain '' is inappropriate in the context of porous materials with fibrous microstructure , such as textiles , polymeric gels , or tissues , we use it generically for convenience .",
    "we assume here that the two constituent materials are incompressible , meaning that the mass densities of the fluid , @xmath0 , and of the solid , @xmath1 , are constant .",
    "note that this does not prohibit compression of the solid skeleton ",
    "variations in the macroscopic mass density of the porous material are enabled by changes in its pore volume .",
    "the assumption of incompressible constituents is standard in soil mechanics and biomechanics , where fluid pressures and solid stresses are typically very small compared to the bulk moduli of the constituent materials .",
    "however , some caution is merited in the context of deep aquifers where , at a depth of a few kilometers , the hydrostatic pressure and lithostatic stress themselves approach a few percent of the bulk moduli of water and mineral grains . in these cases",
    ", it may be appropriate to allow for fluid compressibility while retaining the incompressibility of the solid grains , in which case much of the theory discussed here still applies .",
    "the theory of poroelasticity can be generalized to allow for compressible constituents  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "what follows is , in essence , a brief and superficial introduction to continuum mechanics in the context of a porous material .",
    "we have minimized the mathematical complexity where possible for the sake of clarity , and to preserve an emphasis on the fundamental physics .",
    "for the more mathematically inclined reader , excellent resources are available for further study  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a core concept in continuum mechanics is the distinction between a lagrangian reference frame ( fixed to the material ) and an eulerian one ( fixed in space ) .",
    "these two perspectives are rigorously equivalent , so the choice is purely a matter of convention and convenience .",
    "a lagrangian frame is the natural and traditional choice in solid mechanics , where displacements are typically small and where the current state of stress is always tied to the reference ( undeformed ) configuration of the material through the current state of strain ( displacement gradients ) .",
    "an eulerian frame is the natural and traditional choice in fluid mechanics , where displacements are typically large and where the current state of stress depends only on the instantaneous rate of strain ( velocity gradients ) .",
    "more complex materials such as viscoelastic solids and non - newtonian fluids can have elements of both , with a dependence on both strain and strain rate  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "problems involving fluid - solid coupling lead to a clear conflict between the eulerian and lagrangian approaches . in classical fluid - structure interaction problems , such as air flow around a flapping flag or blood flow through an artery ,",
    "the fluid and the solid exist in separate domains that are coupled along a shared moving boundary . in a porous material , in contrast , the fluid and the solid coexist in the same domain and are coupled through bulk conservation laws . as a result ,",
    "the entire problem must be posed either in a fixed eulerian frame or in a lagrangian frame attached to the solid skeleton .",
    "one major advantage of the latter approach is that it eliminates moving ( solid ) boundaries since the skeleton is stationary relative to a lagrangian coordinate system ; this feature is particularly powerful and convenient in the context of computation .",
    "however , the eulerian approach leads to a simpler and more intuitive mathematical model in the context of fluid flow and transport , and it is straightforward and even advantageous when boundary motion is absent or geometrically simple .",
    "this conflict can be avoided altogether when the deformation of the skeleton is small , such that the distinction between an eulerian frame and a lagrangian one can be ignored , which is a core assumption of linear ( poro)elasticity .    in the present context ,",
    "we consider two model problems where the fluid and the skeleton are tightly coupled , the deformation of the skeleton is large , and there is a moving boundary .",
    "we pose these problems fully in an eulerian frame and write all quantities as functions of an eulerian coordinate @xmath2 , fixed in the laboratory frame .",
    "accordingly , we adopt the notation @xmath3 where the @xmath4 are the components of the eulerian coordinate system , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the associated unit vectors , and adopting the einstein summation convention . for reference and comparison ,",
    "we summarize the key aspects of the lagrangian framework in appendix  [ app : s : lagrangian ] .",
    "we denote the local volume fractions of fluid and solid by @xmath7 ( the porosity , fluid fraction , or void fraction ) and @xmath8 ( the solid fraction ) , respectively .",
    "these are the _ true _ volume fractions in the sense that they measure the current phase volume per unit current total volume , such that @xmath9 .",
    "as such , the true porosity is the relevant quantity for calculating flow and transport through the pore structure .",
    "however , changes in @xmath7 at a spatial point @xmath2 reflect both deformation and motion of the underlying skeleton , so the relevant state of stress must be calculated with some care .",
    "alternatively , it is possible to define _ nominal _ volume fractions that measure the current phase volume per unit reference total volume  @xcite .",
    "these nominal quantities are convenient in a lagrangian frame where , if the solid phase is incompressible , the nominal solid fraction is constant by definition and the nominal porosity is linearly related to the local volumetric strain .",
    "however , the nominal porosity is not directly relevant to flow and transport .",
    "in addition , the nominal volume fractions do not sum to unity ; rather , they must sum to the jacobian determinant @xmath10 ( see  [ ss : kinematics_solid ] ) .",
    "here , we avoid these nominal quantities and work strictly with the true porosity . note that @xcite denotes the true porosity ( `` eulerian porosity '' ) by @xmath11 and the nominal porosity ( `` lagrangian porosity '' ) by @xmath12 , whereas we denote the true porosity by @xmath7 and the nominal porosity by @xmath13 ( see appendix  [ app : s : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "the most primitive quantity for calculating deformation is the displacement field , which is a map between the current configuration of the solid skeleton and its reference configuration .",
    "in other words , the displacement field measures the displacement of material points from their reference positions . in an eulerian frame , the solid displacement field @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the reference position of the material point that sits at position  @xmath2 at time  @xmath17 ( _ i.e. _ , it is the lagrangian coordinate in our eulerian frame ) .",
    "we adopt the convention that @xmath18 such that @xmath19 ; this is not required , but it simplifies the analysis .    the displacement field is not directly a measure of deformation because it includes rigid - body motions . the deformation - gradient tensor @xmath20 , which is the jacobian of the deformation field , excludes translations by considering the spatial gradient of the displacement field . in an eulerian frame ,",
    "@xmath20 is most readily defined through its inverse , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the inverse and @xmath23 is the identity tensor .",
    "the deformation - gradient tensor @xmath20 still includes rigid - body rotations , but these can be excluded by multiplying @xmath20 by its transpose .",
    "hence , measures of strain are ultimately derived from the right  cauchy - green deformation tensor @xmath24 or the left  cauchy - green deformation tensor @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the transpose .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath27 of @xmath28 ( or , equivalently , of @xmath29 ) are the squares of the principal stretches @xmath30 , with @xmath5 .",
    "the stretches measure the amount of elongation along the principal axes of the deformation , which are themselves related to the eigenvectors of @xmath28 and @xmath29 : in the reference configuration , they are the normalized eigenvectors of @xmath28 ; in the current configuration , they are the normalized eigenvectors of @xmath29 .    the jacobian determinant @xmath10 measures the amount of local volume change during the deformation , @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the determinant .",
    "the jacobian determinant is precisely the ratio of the current volume of the material at point @xmath2 to its reference volume . for an incompressible solid skeleton , @xmath33 . for a compressible solid skeleton made up of incompressible solid grains , as considered here ,",
    "deformation occurs strictly through rearrangement of the pore structure .",
    "the jacobian determinant is then connected directly to the porosity , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reference porosity field . in an eulerian frame ,",
    "the reference porosity field depends on @xmath36 because it refers to the initial porosity of the material that is currently located at @xmath2 but that was originally located at @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 unless @xmath39 is spatially uniform , in which case @xmath40 is simply a constant and this distinction is unimportant .",
    "lastly , local continuity for the incompressible solid phase is written @xmath41=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the solid velocity field .",
    "the solid velocity is the material derivative of the solid displacement , @xmath43 equations   provide an exact kinematic description of the deformation of the solid skeleton , assuming only that the solid phase is incompressible .",
    "this description is valid for arbitrarily large deformations and , because it is simply a geometric description of the changing pore space , it _ makes no assumptions about the fluid that occupies the pore space_. this description remains rigorously valid when the fluid phase is compressible , and in the presence of multiple fluid phases .",
    "further , this description _ makes no additional assumptions about the constitutive behavior of the solid skeleton_it remains rigorously valid for any elasticity law , and in the presence of viscous dissipation or plasticity .",
    "we assume that the pore space of the solid skeleton is saturated with a single fluid phase . for a compressible fluid phase , local continuity",
    "is written @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fluid velocity field .",
    "this expression remains valid for multiple fluid phases if @xmath0 and @xmath46 are calculated as fluid - phase - averaged quantities , in which case eq .",
    "must also be supplemented by a conservation law for each of the individual fluid phases .",
    "for simplicity , we focus here on the case of a single , incompressible fluid phase , for which we have @xmath47 there is no need to introduce a fluid displacement field since we assume below that the fluid is newtonian .",
    "the constitutive law for a newtonian fluid , and also for many non - newtonian fluids , depends only on the fluid velocity .",
    "we assume that the fluid flows relative to the solid skeleton according to darcy s law . for a single newtonian fluid , darcy s law",
    "can be written @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the permeability of the solid skeleton , which we have taken to be an isotropic function of porosity only , @xmath50 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath51 is the body force per unit mass due to gravity , and we have neglected body forces other than gravity .",
    "darcy s law is an implicit statement about the continuum - scale form of the mechanical interactions between the fluid and solid  ( _ e.g. _ ,  3.3.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "we simply adopt it here as a phenomenological model for flow of a single fluid through a porous material . in the presence of multiple fluid phases , eq .",
    "can be replaced by the classical multiphase extension of darcy s law  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "for a single but non - newtonian fluid phase ,",
    "eq .   must be modified accordingly  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "generally , the permeability will change with the pore structure as the skeleton deforms , although this dependence is neglected in linear poroelasticity , where it is assumed that deformations are infinitesimal .",
    "the simplest representation of this dependence is to take the permeability to be a function of the porosity , as we have done above , and here again the true porosity is the relevant quantity .",
    "a common choice is the kozeny - carman formula , one form of which is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the typical pore or grain size .",
    "although derived from experimental measurements in beds of close - packed spheres , this formula is commonly used for a wide range of materials .",
    "one reason for this wide use is that the kozeny - carman formula respects two physical limits that are important for poromechanics : the permeability vanishes as the porosity vanishes , and diverges as the porosity approaches unity .",
    "the former requirement ensures that fluid flow can not drive the porosity below zero , and the latter prevents the flow from driving the porosity above unity .",
    "we use a normalized kozeny - carman formula here , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the relaxed or undeformed permeability .",
    "this expression preserves the qualitative characteristics of the original relationship while allowing the initial permeability and the initial porosity to be imposed independently .",
    "clearly , it is straightforward to design other permeability laws that have the same characteristics .",
    "note that the particular choice of permeability law will dominate the flow and mechanics in the limit of vanishing permeability since the pressure gradient , which is coupled with the solid mechanics , is inversely proportional to the permeability .    since porosity is strictly volumetric ,",
    "writing @xmath56 neglects the impacts of rotation and shear .",
    "this form of deformation dependence is overly simplistic for materials with inherently anisotropic permeability fields , the axes of which would rotate under rigid - body rotation and would be distorted in shear .",
    "it is also possible that permeability anisotropy could emerge through anisotropic deformations , or through other effects creating orthotropic structure .",
    "we neglect these effects here for simplicity .      one convenient way of combining eqs .  , , and is by defining the total volume flux @xmath57 as @xmath58 this measures the total volume flow per unit total cross - sectional area per unit time .",
    "the total flux can also be viewed as a phase - averaged , composite , or bulk velocity . from this , it is then straightforward to derive    [ eq : nonlinearadeeulerian ] @xmath59 = 0~,\\label{eq : nonlinearadeeulerian_pde } \\\\",

    "it remains to enforce mechanical equilibrium , and to provide a constitutive relation between stress and deformation within the solid skeleton .",
    "mechanical equilibrium requires that the fluid and the solid skeleton must jointly support the local mechanical load , and this provides the fundamental poromechanical coupling .",
    "the total stress @xmath61 is the total force supported by the two - phase system per unit area , and can be written @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the solid stress and the fluid stress , respectively .",
    "the solid stress is the force supported by the solid per unit solid area , and @xmath65 is then the force supported by the solid per unit total area .",
    "similarly , the fluid stress is the force supported by the fluid per unit fluid area , and @xmath66 is then the force supported by the fluid per unit total area . note that it is implicitly assumed here and elsewhere that the phase area fractions are equivalent to the phase volume fractions .",
    "any stress tensor can be decomposed into isotropic ( volumetric ) and deviatoric ( shear ) components without loss of generality . for a fluid within a porous",
    "solid , it can be shown that the shear component of the stress is negligible relative to the volumetric component at the continuum scale  ( _ e.g. _ ,  3.3.1 of * ? ? ?",

    "note that we have adopted the sign convention from solid mechanics that tension is positive and compression negative .",
    "the opposite convention is usually used in soil mechanics , rock mechanics , and geomechanics since geomaterials are almost always in compression .    because the fluid permeates the solid skeleton",
    ", the solid stress must include an isotropic and compressive component in response to the fluid pressure .",
    "this component is present even when the fluid is at rest , and/or when the skeleton carries no external load , but this component can not contribute to deformation unless the solid grains are compressible . subtracting this component from the solid stress leads to terzaghi s effective stress @xmath70",

    "the stress tensors in eq .   are cauchy or _",
    "true _ stresses .",
    "these are eulerian quantities , and eq .   is an eulerian statement : _ the current forces on current areas in the current configuration must balance . _",
    "we assume that the solid skeleton is an elastic material , for which the state of stress depends on the displacement of material points from a relaxed reference state .",
    "this behavior distinguishes the theory of poroelasticity from , for example , the poroviscous framework traditionally used in magma / mantle dynamics , where the skeleton is assumed to behave as a viscous fluid over geophysical time scales  ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies the mathematical framework for large deformations by eliminating any dependence on displacement , but we can not take advantage of it here .",
    "the constitutive law for an elastic solid skeleton typically links the effective stress to the solid displacement via an appropriate measure of strain or strain energy . for large deformations ,",
    "elastic behavior is nonlinear for two reasons .",
    "first , the kinematics is inherently nonlinear because the geometry of the body evolves with the deformation ( kinematic nonlinearity ) .",
    "second , most materials harden or soften under large strains as their internal microstructure evolves  that is , the material properties change with the deformation ( material or constitutive nonlinearity ) .    to capture the kinematic nonlinearities introduced by the evolving geometry , relevant measures of finite strain are typically derived from one of the cauchy - green deformation tensors .",
    "a wide variety of finite - strain measures exist , each of which is paired with an appropriate measure of stress through a stress - strain constitutive relation that includes at least two elastic parameters . in modern hyperelasticity theory ,",
    "this constitutive relation takes the form of a strain - energy density function .",
    "selection of an appropriate constitutive law and subsequent tuning of the elastic parameters can ultimately match a huge variety of material behaviors , but our focus here is simply on capturing kinematic nonlinearity .",
    "for this purpose , we consider a simple hyperelastic model known as hencky elasticity .",
    "the key idea in hencky elasticity is to retain the classical strain - energy density function of linear elasticity , but replacing the infinitesimal strain with the hencky strain  @xcite .",
    "hencky strain , also known `` natural strain '' or `` true strain '' , is an extension to three dimensions of the one - dimensional concept of logarithmic strain .",
    "hencky elasticity is a generic model in that it does not account for material - specific constitutive nonlinearity , but it captures the full geometric nonlinearity of large deformations and thus provides a good model for the elastic behavior of a wide variety of materials under moderate to large deformations  @xcite .",
    "it is also very commonly used in large - deformation plasticity .",
    "hencky strain has some computational disadvantages  @xcite , but these are not relevant here .",
    "hencky elasticity can be written    [ eq : hencky_elasticity ] @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the hencky strain tensor and the @xmath10 on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "accounts for volume change during the deformation .",
    "hencky elasticity reduces to linear elasticity for small strains and , conveniently , it uses the same elastic parameters as linear elasticity ( see  [ s : linearporoelasticity ] ) . for compactness",
    ", we work in terms of the oedometric or @xmath77-wave modulus @xmath78 and lam s first parameter @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the bulk modulus and shear modulus of the solid skeleton , respectively .",
    "note that lam s first parameter is often denoted @xmath82 , but we use @xmath83 here to avoid confusion with the principal stretches @xmath30 .",
    "all of these elastic moduli are `` drained '' properties , meaning that they are mechanical properties of the solid skeleton alone and must be measured under quasistatic conditions where the fluid is allowed to drain ( leave ) or enter freely .      poromechanics describes flow and deformation within a porous material , so the boundaries of the spatial domain typically coincide with the boundaries of the solid skeleton .",
    "these boundaries may move as the skeleton deforms ; in an eulerian framework , this constitutes a moving - boundary problem .",
    "this feature is the primary disadvantage of working in an eulerian framework as it can be analytically and numerically inconvenient .",
    "one noteworthy exception is in infinite or semi - infinite domains , in which case suitable far - field conditions are applied ; this situation is common in geophysical problems , which are often spatially extensive .    to close the model presented above",
    ", we require kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions for the fluid and the skeleton .",
    "kinematic conditions are straightforward : for the fluid , the most common kinematic conditions are constraints on the flux through the boundaries ; for the solid , kinematic conditions typically enforce that the boundaries of the domain are _ material _ boundaries , meaning that they move with the skeleton .",
    "the simplest dynamic conditions are an imposed total stress , an imposed effective stress , or an imposed fluid pressure . at a permeable boundary , any two of these three quantities can be imposed . at an unconstrained permeable boundary ,",
    "for example , the normal component of the total stress will come from the fluid pressure and the shear component must vanish ; this then implies that both the normal and shear components of the effective stress must vanish . at an impermeable boundary , in contrast",
    ", only the total stress can be imposed  the decomposition of the load into fluid pressure and effective stress within the domain will arise naturally through the solution of the problem ( although imposed shear stress can only be supported by the solid skeleton , via effective stress ) .",
