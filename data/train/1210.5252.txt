    "however , the effect on the disk modeling is minimal , with a difference in the disk structure constraints well within their uncertainties as shown by @xcite .    the best - fit model to a single wavelength observation is found through @xmath58 minimization with 3 free parameters that describe the surface density ( @xmath59 ) , since the disk geometry is fixed based on molecular line observations ( @xmath37 , pa@xmath36 * ? ? ?",

    "since the disk is optically thin ( right panel , figure  [ sigmaxt ] ) , the observed emission will depend directly upon the dust opacity and disk mass : @xmath75 .",
    "hence , our observations constrain the product @xmath76 , where all these physical parameters ( @xmath77 ) depend on the radius , but only the dust opacity depends on the observed wavelength . the modeling",
    "presented above , assuming a constant dust opacity with radius and fitting each wavelength separately , has resulted in a wavelength - dependent @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which is unphysical but telling : the assumption of a constant @xmath66 with radius is likely incorrect .",
    "radial variations of the dust opacity are required to reconcile the differing visibility profiles ( real part vs. @xmath80-distance , figure  [ amp_vs_uvdist ] ) and the wavelength - dependent @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( figure  [ sigmaxt ] ) .",

    "equation  [ deltabeta ] is a useful prescription to constrain radial variations of the opacity spectral slope ( @xmath92 ) in dual - wavelength observations . here",
    "@xmath93 corresponds to the spectral slope of the assumed radially constant dust opacity .    in the rayleigh - jeans regime ( when @xmath94 , @xmath95 : boltzmann constant ) , knowledge of @xmath83 to derive @xmath96 is unnecessary since @xmath97 .",
    "however , in the cold outer disk and at short wavelengths , the rayleigh - jeans assumption is ill - founded ( e.g. @xmath98 for @xmath99  k at 0.88 mm ) .",
    "consequently , we require an estimate of @xmath83 . since the temperature profiles inferred from each wavelength ( @xmath79 ) are not very different , we average them to deduce @xmath83 ( dashed - line on figure  [ sigmaxt ] ) .",

    "to set confidence intervals on @xmath96 , we make use of the bayesian approach upon which our modeling is based .",
    "since the result of the mcmc algorithm is a fully sampled posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) for all the model parameters , we construct a pdf of the product @xmath103 at each radius @xmath91 and for each wavelength .",
    "random samples of these pdfs are taken at each wavelength , the slope of the line through points \\{@xmath100 ,",

    "this slope corresponds to one random sampling of @xmath96 .",
    "hence , the pdf for @xmath96 is constructed by performing a large number of random samples .",
    "the peak of this pdf is the best - fit value of @xmath105 at radius @xmath91 .",
    "confidence intervals are derived from the region of the pdf that contains 68.3% ,  95.5%  and  99.7% of all samples at equal probability ( @xmath106 ,  and  @xmath19 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_beta ] presents the constraints on the radial variation of @xmath2 obtained from our multi - wavelength observations .",
    "the values of @xmath2 allowed by our observations are significantly different than @xmath107 , for @xmath11  au .",
    "furthermore , we find a gradient on @xmath3 inconsistent with a constant value at the 10@xmath8 level .      to derive equation  [ deltabeta ] , the assumption of @xmath86 must be satisfied .",
    "we caution that for @xmath108 - 1 mm this approximation may break down @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig_beta ] ( right ) .",
    "therefore , rather than inferring @xmath12 from @xmath3 , we constrain it directly by fitting a specific dust opacity @xmath109 to the constraints on the product @xmath110 at each radius . with a knowledge of @xmath83 , and for a fixed set of dust properties ( composition and grain - size distribution )",
    ", we estimate the values of @xmath9 and @xmath111 that satisfy equation [ equality ] , now written as @xmath112 where the right - hand side corresponds to our model ( with parameters @xmath9 and @xmath111 ) , and the left - hand side has been constrained by our multi - wavelength observations ( i.e. we have a pdf for the product @xmath113 ) .    at each radius r",
    ", we constructed a two dimensional grid of parameters @xmath114 . at each point in the grid , we compute the product @xmath115 at each wavelength .",
    "we then find the probability that such measurement will have occurred ( given our observational constraints on the left - hand side of equation  [ new_equality ] ) , and construct the likelihood function of the parameters @xmath114 .",
    "best - fit values for @xmath9 and @xmath111 are found by maximizing the likelihood , confidence intervals are obtained from the marginalized likelihoods .",

    "we compare our observational constraints with theoretical models of grain growth , employing the approximations presented in @xcite for the evolution of @xmath9 with radius .",
    "since the true @xmath82 profile constrained by our observations depends on the assumed value of @xmath60 ( see figure  [ fig_amax ] ) , these theoretical prescriptions will depend on @xmath60 as well .",
    "our observational constraints on @xmath9 are consistent with a _ radial drift limited _ grain population , where the head - wind felt by dust particles makes them spiral towards the star .",
    "a _ fragmentation dominated _ population , where the turbulent relative motion of particles causes collisions that either grow or fragment these grains , seems incompatible for standard values of the turbulence parameter ( @xmath118 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fragmentation threshold velocity ( @xmath119 m / s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and 100:1 gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "these curves represent barriers that prevent further size increase , hence , the smaller of the two is considered the upper - limit to growth .",
    "however , the parameters that go into deriving the fragmentation limit are very uncertain , while the physics and parameters in radial drift are better established .",
    "either no fragmentation barrier exists ( for a low - turbulence disk , @xmath120 , the maximum collision speed never reaches the fragmentation threshold velocity in as 209 , making fragmentation impossible ) or the gas - to - dust ratio is @xmath121 larger , allowing for the fragmentation - limited barrier to be consistent with our @xmath12 constraint . it remains to be demonstrated whether these models reproduce the observed @xmath3 profile and the millimeter fluxes .",
    "such analysis requires numerical simulations starting from the disk parameters derived here and will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "we have obtained multi - wavelength spatially - resolved observations at 0.88 , 2.8 , 8.0 , and 9.8 mm of the as 209  circumstellar disk .",
    "these observations reveal a wavelength - dependent structure , explained as radial variations of the dust opacity across the disk .",
    "we find a change in @xmath122 between the inner ( @xmath5  au ) and outer ( @xmath123  au ) disk , inconsistent with a constant @xmath2 value .",
    "this gradient in @xmath3 implies that a significant change in the dust properties as a function of radius must exist .",
    "we interpret this gradient as a decrease in the maximum grain size with radius : going from several centimeters or more in the inner disk to sub - mm - sized grains in the outer disk .",
