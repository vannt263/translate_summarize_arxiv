    "this contribution to the proceedings gives an overview of some recent results for deep inelastic scattering mainly with neutrino beams interacting through charged currents .",
    "neutrino data are an important component of pdf analyses because the weak currents single out quark flavour combinations different from those probed by the electromagnetic current ; e.g.  a charmed particle detected in the final state singles out the strange sea . even more , armed with a qcd calculation of neutrino cross - sections , event rates can be related to neutrino fluxes in cases where the neutrino flux is unknown or its flavour composition is expected to oscillate , e.g.  between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "a satisfying conciliation of neutrino and charged lepton structure functions at modestly low-@xmath7  addressed before in terms of the naive parton model as a violation of the approximate `` 5/18-rule ''  has been a problem for a while .",
    "charm production effects and charm mass dependence in the neutrino data have proven important and a `` physics model independent '' analysis @xcite has improved the situation over previous comparisons which corrected for charm in a physics model dependent way . but comparing data sets for different hard processes for mutual compatibility necessarily requires the data to be compared to a common underlying theoretical model .",
    "a global pqcd analysis of hard scattering data provides the most appropriate framework for this comparison .",
    "[ fig : cteq ] shows preliminary results of such a study @xcite which is an extension of @xcite .",
    "the pdfs in @xcite were obtained setting @xmath8 in the hard cross sections at collider energies . in @xcite the dis charm threshold was taken into account and @xmath9 was employed with the cross sections in @xcite .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : cteq ] are derived from a ( simplified ) acot ( @xmath10 ) prescription which  as explained in the second ref .  of @xcite",
    " uses a slow rescaling variable @xmath10 to respect the @xmath11-dependent threshold condition @xmath12 ; results for a pdf set in the _ fixed flavour scheme _ are also underway @xcite . the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : cteq ] quantifies the amount of change in the pdfs that compensates for introducing the charm threshold in the dis hard scattering cross - sections .",
    "this systematic shift can be larger than the statistical uncertainties in the pdfs @xcite . in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : cteq ] one observes that the agreement with the `` physics model independent '' neutrino structure functions is not fully satisfactory at low-@xmath11 .",
    "compare , however , with robert bernstein s presentation at this conference of preliminary nutev structure functions @xcite .",
    "the tendency seems to be that these preliminary results compare more favourably with the nlo pdf predictions at low-@xmath11 .",
    "apart from @xmath13 , there is no room here to discuss further theoretical factors in the evaluation of neutrino structure functions and the reader is referred to @xcite and to the literature quoted therein . as it stands now , the data for @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cteq ] and for @xmath15 as analyzed in @xcite are not described fully satisfyingly by perturbative qcd .",
    "the strange sea density @xmath16 is the least well determined of the quark pdfs @xcite .",
    "interest in @xmath16 was revived recently also from the fact that the anomaly in the nutev measurement of the weinberg angle may depend on intrinsic @xmath17 fluctuations generating @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "global qcd fits have previously employed the integrated strangeness suppression factor @xmath19 to constrain @xmath16 .",
    "more detailed information can be expected from analyzing cc neutrino - production of charm ( @xmath20 ) at fully differential level including all nlo diagrams . as in the nc case",
    ", theory needs to provide differential information because of detector non - isotropy and experimental cuts .",
    "[ fig : lego ] shows a recent calculation @xcite for typical fixed target kinematics .",
    "a fortran code disco has been made available and was interfaced with the nutev detector monte carlo .",
    "it should soon be possible to fix the size of @xmath16 at nlo and settle the question whether @xmath21 is of relevant size .",
    "results from the superkamiokande underground experiment measuring the atmospheric neutrino flux suggest that @xmath22 neutrinos oscillate into @xmath1 neutrinos with nearly maximal mixing @xcite .",
    "a test of the oscillation hypothesis is @xmath23 production of @xmath1 through charged current interactions , a process which will be studied in underground neutrino telescopes as well as long - baseline experiments measuring neutrino fluxes from accelerator sources . in the following the deep - inelastic contribution to @xmath24",
    "is presented incorporating nlo qcd corrections , target mass , @xmath1 mass and charmed quark mass corrections @xcite .",
    "future work will combine dis with elastic and resonant neutrino - production channels .",
    "the charged current @xmath6 ( anti-)neutrino differential cross section is represented by a standard set of 5 structure functions @xcite : @xmath25 f_2^{w^\\pm } % \\\\ \\nonumber & \\pm &   \\left[x y ( 1-\\frac{y}{2})-\\frac{m_{\\tau}^2 y}{4 e_{\\nu } m_n}\\right ] f_3^{w^\\pm } \\\\",

    "( [ eq : aj1 ] ) and compares @xmath5 and @xmath6 dis interactions with and without dis cuts .",
    "the effect of these imposed cuts is much less pronounced for @xmath6 dis where @xmath32 acts as a physical cut - off of non - dis interaction .",
    "it may surprise how slowly @xmath33 approaches @xmath34 from below at very high neutrino energies indicating a persistent @xmath1 threshold effect .",
    "about half of the reduction at high energies is actually of dynamic origin , to be attributed to a negative contribution of @xmath27 to ( [ eq : nusig ] ) . around e.g.  1 tev the @xmath35 suppression",
    "is compensated to some extent by the low-@xmath11 rise of @xmath36 which is not tempered by factors of @xmath11 or @xmath37 .",
    "the net effect is that the remaining threshold suppression is seemingly doubled .",
