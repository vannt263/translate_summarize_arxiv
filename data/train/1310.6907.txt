    "pollux ( @xmath2 geminorum , hd 62509 ) is a well studied k0iii giant neighbour of the sun . it is considered as an archetype of a giant star hosting a planet since its presents periodic sinusoidal radial velocity ( rv ) variations which have been stable during more than 25 years ( ) . now , discovered a weak magnetic field at the surface of pollux whose variations could be correlated with the rv ones .",
    "we have therefore performed a zeeman survey of pollux and collected spectropolarimetric data during 4.25 years i.e. more than for two periods of the rv variations .",
    "from 2007 september to 2012 february , using first espadons ( ) at cfht in a snapshot program , then narval ( its twin ) at the tbl in a systematic survey , we observed pollux on 41 dates and got 266 stokes @xmath0 series .",
    "the observational properties of the instruments and reduction techniques are the same as described by . to obtain a high - precision diagnosis of the spectral line circular polarization , lsd ( )",
    "was applied to each reduced stokes @xmath1 and @xmath0 spectrum . from these mean stokes profiles we computed the surface - averaged longitudinal magnetic field @xmath3 in g , using the first - order moment method adapted to lsd profiles ( ) .",
    "the rv of pollux was measured from the averaged lsd stokes @xmath1 using a gaussian fit .",
    "figure 1 shows the variations of rv ( left plot ) and @xmath3 ( right plot ) during the 2007 - 2012 seasons of our survey : the @xmath3 variations appear to follow those of rv .",

    "a sinusoid with p= 589.64 d is fitted for each parameter.,title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]",
    "figure 1 shows the fit of the variations of rv and @xmath3 with a sinusoid of p = 589.64 d as derived by . with this period and adjusting the amplitude of the @xmath3 variations to 0.2 g , the sinusoids obtained by least squares fitting have a phase shift of 146 d , i.e. about 25 % of the period .    .    to use the whole zeeman information included in our stokes v data , and to independently infer the rotational period @xmath4 and the magnetic topology of pollux",
    ", we have used the zdi method in the version of donati et al .",
    "we limited the number of spherical harmonics to @xmath5 since increasing the threshold did not change significantly the results .",
    "we have followed the approach of petit et al ( 2002 ) for determining the @xmath4 of pollux , and we find a value of about 587 d as a favoured period .",
    "this is very near the rv variation period and both are possible @xmath4 with respect to our error bars . since the rv period has been found stable during more than 25 years , we consider that it is the real @xmath4 and will use it hereafter in this work . with these parameters ,",
    "our prefered zdi model is the following : the inclination angle @xmath6 is 60@xmath7 and the poloidal component contains 71 % of the reconstructed magnetic energy .",
    "the dipole component corresponds to about 99 % of this poloidal magnetic energy .",
    "the mean magnetic field @xmath8 is 0.7 g , and the angle between the rotation and magnetic dipole axis @xmath2 is about 20@xmath7 . in these conditions and within the solid rotation hypothesis",
    ", the @xmath9 of pollux would be 0.7 km s@xmath10 .    .",
    "the magnetic field strength is expressed in g.,width=225 ]",
    "since we found that the @xmath4 of pollux is equal to the period of the rv variations , one has to consider if the weak magnetic field is able to induce these rv variations .",
    "if a planet exists , orbiting around pollux and being responsible for the rv variations , the planet revolution is synchronized with the rotation of the star . from , the mass of the planet is in the range 3 - 13 @xmath11 and the semi major axis is @xmath12 = 1.64 au . in these conditions we are very far from the case occuring with",
    " hot jupiter  class objects ( e.g. ) , and the expected tidal effects are too weak for enabling the synchronization ( ) .    a dipole configuration as inferred for pollux by our zdi study can be regarded as corresponding to two magnetic spots . using the soap online package ( ) we have simulated the effects produced by the magnetic configuration of pollux",
    ": we could generate the observed rv variations but photometric variations of larger amplitude than those detected in the hipparcos data were predicted .",
    "now , and , proposed the effect of macroturbulent velocity spots linked with a surface magnetic field to explain the rv variations of polaris and @xmath13 per respectively .",
    "rv variations up to 100 m s@xmath10 were expected for these stars without inducing photometric variations .",
    "consequently , we consider that the magnetic properties of pollux can make the hosted - planet hypothesis unecessary .",
    "pollux is the first giant with a sub - g mean surface magnetic field for which @xmath4 is determined .",
    "this @xmath4 is also the longest determined up to now for a giant .",
    "if the hypothesis of a planet orbiting around pollux is not retained , the very long stability of the dipolar magnetic field ( more than 25 years or 15 @xmath4 ) has to be taken into account to infer the origin of the magnetic field .",
    "the high rossby number @xmath14 of 2 - 3 inferred for pollux using this @xmath4 and the convective turnover time @xmath15 derived using the evolutionary models with rotation of and charbonnel et al .",
    "( this symposium and in preparation ) suggest that an @xmath13-@xmath16 dynamo alone can not be the origin of the observed magnetic field .",
    "some other possibilities are :    - the high @xmath14 and the stability would suggest pollux being an ap star descendant . however using @xmath8 = 0.7 g and taking into account the magnetic flux conservation hypothesis",
    "we find that an ap star progenitor of pollux would have a magnetic strength of about 14 g , i.e. well below the 100 - 300 g lower limit found for ap star dipole strength by .",
    "- an extreme case of dynamo when rotation is not involved is a local dynamo as inferred in the case of betelgeuse ( ) .",
    "however , in the case of pollux the expected number of convective cells is much greater than inferred for betelgeuse .",
    "furthermore , in the case of betelgeuse the magnetic field is observed to vary intrinsically on timescales of weeks to months .",
    "- an intermediate case of dynamo that could operate during the red giant branch phase because of the deepening of the convective envelope , is the distributed dynamo .",
    "this type of dynamo is expected to occur in m dwarfs , and a long term stability has been reported in the case of the fast rotating and strongly magnetic star v374 peg ( ) .",
    "one could suggest that a weak dynamo regime could be stable as well .",
    "we have monitored the magnetic field of pollux during 4.25 years .",
    "our zdi investigation shows that the @xmath4 is equal to the rv variation period and that the pollux surface magnetic field is mainly poloidal and dipolar .",
    "we then show that photometric and macroturbulent - velocity spots associated to the magnetic poles could explain the rv variations and could then make the hosted - planet hypothesis unnecessary . in this hypothesis , to explain the long term stability of the rv variations , the magnetic field of pollux should be stable during tens of years .",
    "we suggest that a weak - regime dynamo ( of interface - type ? ) could be the origin of the magnetic field of pollux .    in this way pollux",
    "could be the representative of a class of weakly magnetic g k giants , recently discovered ( aurire  in preparation , konstantinova - antova this symposium ) .",
    "these stars would include bright giants like alphard and arcturus , and some of them , like aldebaran and @xmath17 tau also present stable rv variations and are considered to host planets . though we can not exclude completely that neither pollux hosts a planet in addition to its magnetic field , nor that it is a peculiar very stable magnetic star , our investigation suggests that pollux could be the archetype of a class of weakly magnetic g k giants ."
