    "while a sizeable electron - phonon coupling is prerequisite for polaron formation , it is not generally true that a system with strong electron - phonon interactions ( @xmath1 ) has to display polaronic features . in a simple metal with wide bare bands and long range forces like lead , for instance ,",
    "intersite off - diagonal hopping terms prevent trapping of the charge carriers and onset of a polaronic state . in strong coupling systems with a narrow electronic band @xmath2",
    "the antiadiabatic inequality @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the characteristic phonon frequency ) is likely fulfilled thus ensuring the stability of the unit comprising electron and phonon cloud that is , the small polaron @xcite .",
    "also in adiabatic regimes small polarons can form although a real space broadening of the quasiparticle has to be expected , at least in three dimensional systems . as a consequence ,",
    "the adiabatic polaron mass renormalization is less strong than that occuring for the antiadiabatic polaron once the strength of the electron - phonon coupling has been fixed @xcite",
    ". theoretical investigation on these issues has become intense after that a polaronic mechanism has been proposed @xcite as a viable possibility to explain high @xmath5 superconductivity with its peculiar transport properties .",
    "evidence has been recently provided @xcite for the polaronic nature of carriers also in perovskite manganites with colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) and a strong coupling of carriers to jahn - teller lattice distortions has been suggested @xcite to explain the resistivity peak located at the curie temperature @xcite .",
    "although polarons are invoked to account for different resistivity behaviors in systems with some lattice distortions @xcite , the common origin , if any does exist , of such behaviors remains unexplained and a unifying theory is lacking .",
    "in general , a strong electron - phonon coupling implies violation of the migdal theorem @xcite and polaron collapse of the electron band with the appearance of time retarded interactions in the system .",
    "the path integral method @xcite has proved successful in dealing with this problem since a retarded potential naturally emerges in the exact integral action .",
    "both the frhlich @xcite and the holstein @xcite polaron properties have been studied by using path integrals techniques .    in this paper",
    "we propose a path integral approach to the problem of a polaron scattered by a local lattice instability arising from an anharmonic phonon mode .",
    "small polarons are assumed to exist by virtue of the strong _ overall _ electron - phonon coupling and independently of the _ single _ anharmonic mode . as an example , the latter could be associated with the motion of apical oxygen atoms in @xmath6 superconductor where a c - axis polarized high frequency phonon couples to in - plane charge carriers @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the highly correlated motion of in - plane holes and c - axis lattice vibrations could in _ itself _ give origin to a small polaron @xcite .",
    "we model the local instability by a double well potential in its two state configuration , a two level system ( tls ) , and the one dimensional atomic path between the two equilibrium minima is taken as time dependent @xcite .",
    "retardation effects are thus naturally introduced in the full partition function and the path integral method permits to derive the effective time ( temperature ) dependent coupling strengths which control the resistivity .",
    "our starting point is contained in the following hamiltonian    @xmath7    @xmath8 is the time which scales as an inverse temperature according to the matsubara green s function formalism .",
    "@xmath9 is the free hamiltonian made of : a ) a polaron created ( distroyed ) by @xmath10 in an energy band @xmath11 whose width decreases exponentially by increasing the strength of the overall electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; b ) a diatomic molecular lattice whose phonon frequencies @xmath14 are obtained analytically through a force constant approach ; c ) a two level system in its symmetric ground state configuration due to an anharmonic phonon mode .",
    "@xmath15 is the one dimensional _",
    "space - time _ hopping path followed by the atom which moves between two equlibrium positions located at @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the bare hopping time between the two minima of the tls and @xmath18 is the instant at which the @xmath19-hop takes place .",
    "one atomic path is characterized by the number @xmath20 of hops , by the set of @xmath18 @xmath21 and by @xmath17 .",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the class of @xmath8-linear paths yields the main contribution to the full partition function of the interacting system @xcite .",
    "the closure condition on the path is given by : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inverse temperature and @xmath24 is the time one atom is sitting in a well .",
    "the interaction is described by @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the coupling strength between tls and polaron , @xmath27 is the renormalized ( versus time ) tunneling energy which allows one to introduce the @xmath8 dependence in the interacting hamiltonian @xcite .    following a method previously developed @xcite in the study of the kondo problem , we multiply @xmath27 by a fictitious coupling constant @xmath28 @xmath29 and , by differentiating with respect to @xmath28 , one derives the one path contribution to the partition function of the system    @xmath30    where , @xmath31 is the partition function related to @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the full propagator for polarons satisfying a dyson s equation :    @xmath34    the polaronic free propagator @xmath35 can be derived exactly in the model displayed by eqs.(1 ) .",
    "we get the full partition function of the system by integrating over the times @xmath18 and summing over all possible even number of hops :    @xmath36   \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\beta e(n , t_i , \\tau_0)=\\ , \\l - \\bigl(k^{a } + k^{r}\\bigr ) \\sum_{i > j}^{2n } \\biggl({{t_i - t_j}\\over { \\tau_0}}\\biggr)^2   \\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath37 being the one path atomic energy .",
    "@xmath38 , which is a function of the input parameters , is not essential here while the second addendum in eq.(4 ) is _ not local in time _ as a result of the retarded polaronic interactions between successive atomic hops in the double well potential . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the one path coupling strengths containing the physics of the interacting system .",
    "@xmath39 ( negative ) describes the polaron - polaron attraction mediated by the local instability and @xmath40 ( positive ) is related to to the repulsive scattering of the polaron by the tls .",
    "computation of @xmath37 and its derivative with respect to @xmath41 shows that the largest contribution to the partition function is given by the atomic path with @xmath42 .",
    "the atom moving back and forth in the double well minimizes its energy if it takes the path with the highest @xmath41 value allowed by the boundary condition , that is with @xmath43 .",
    "this result , which is general , provides a criterion to determine the set of dominant paths for the atom at any temperature .",
    "then , the effective interaction strengths @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be obtained as a function of @xmath46 by summing over @xmath47 the dominant paths contributions :    @xmath48    with : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is the phonon occupation factor and @xmath52 is the fermi distribution for polarons . @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the cutoff on the number of hops in a path .",
    "the particular form of @xmath55 suggests that many hops paths are the relevant excitations at low temperatures whereas paths with a low number of hops provide the largest contribution to the partition function at high temperatures . since the effective couplings which determine the resistivity depend on @xmath56 , hence on @xmath57 ( through @xmath58 ) , a relatively small cutoff ( @xmath59 ) ensures numerical convergence of eqs.(5 ) in the whole temperature range . on the other hand the non retarded term @xmath38 in eq.(4 )",
    "has a slower @xmath60 behavior , therefore a larger cutoff should be taken at low temperatures where computation of equilibrium properties such as specific heat is strongly influenced by many hops atomic paths between the minima of the double well excitations .",
    "our lattice hamiltonian is made of diatomic sites whose intramolecular vibrations can favor trapping of the charge carriers @xcite .",
    "the _ intra_molecular frequency @xmath61 largely influences the size of the lattice distortion associated with polaron formation @xcite while the dispersive features of the phonon spectrum controlled by the _ inter_molecular couplings are essential to compute the polaron properties both in the ground state and at finite temperatures .",
    "the range of the intermolecular forces is extended to the second neighbors shell since these couplings remove the phonon modes degeneracy ( with respect to dimensionality ) at the corners of the brillouin zone thus permitting to estimate with accuracy the relevant contributions of high symmetry points to the momentum space summations .    in a simple cubic lattice model with first and second neighbors molecular sites interacting via a force constants",
    "pair potential , the @xmath14 are :    @xmath62    where , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 etc . the intramolecular force constant @xmath66 is related to @xmath61 by @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the reduced molecular mass . @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the intermolecular first and second neighbors force constants , respectively",
    "let s define @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "then the characteristic frequency @xmath4 , which we choose as the zone center frequency , is : @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the coordination number and @xmath75 is the next nearest neighbors number .",
    "we turn now to compute the electrical resistivity due to the polaronic charge carrier scattering by the impurity potential with internal degree of freedom provided by the tls .",
    "assuming s wave scattering , one gets @xcite    @xmath76    where , @xmath77 is the density of tls which act as scatterers , @xmath78 is the fermi velocity , @xmath79 is the cell volume , @xmath80 is the electron density of states , @xmath81 is the charge and @xmath82 is the planck constant .",
    "the phase shift @xmath83 to the electronic wave function at the fermi surface is related to the effective interaction strengths @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the input parameters of the model are six that is , the three molecular force constants , @xmath12 , @xmath2 and the bare energy @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85 can be chosen as @xmath86 consistently with reported values in the literature on tls s which are known to exist in glassy systems @xcite , amorphous metals @xcite , a15 compounds @xcite and likely in some cuprate superconductors @xcite . in these systems",
    "the origin of the tls s is not magnetic .",
    "the bare electronic band @xmath2 is fixed at 0.1ev . in fig.1",
    ", we take a rather large @xmath4 setting the system in moderately adiabatic conditions and an intermediate ( @xmath87 ) to very strong ( @xmath88 ) electron - phonon coupling regime .",
    "the broad resistivity maximum developing at low temperatures in the intermediate regime clearly signals that the tls s are at work here @xcite while , by increasing @xmath46 , the hopping time shortens and the incoming polarons can not distinguish any more the tls internal degree of freedom , then diagonal scattering prevails and a _ quasi linear _",
    "resistivity behavior emerges at @xmath89 . at larger @xmath12",
    "the polaron becomes progressively smaller in real space and the occurence of the self trapping event ( at @xmath90 ) is marked by an abrupt increase in the effective mass , in any dimensionality @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the resistivity becomes non - metallic and its absolute values are strongly enhanced .",
    "let s fix @xmath87 which ensures polaron mobility and tune ( see fig.2 ) the tls - polaron coupling @xmath26 .",
    "we see that a resistivity peak located at @xmath91 arises at @xmath92 with height and width of the peak being strongly dependent on @xmath26 hence , on the tls energy .",
    "the low @xmath46 resistivity still displays the maximum at the unitary limit while the high @xmath46 ( @xmath93 ) behavior can be metallic like ( @xmath94 ) or semiconducting like ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "@xmath96 corresponds to a tls energy of @xmath97 which is comparable to the value of the bare polaron energy band @xmath98 . in this picture",
    ", the resistivity peak has a structural origin and it can be ascribed to resonant tls - polaron scattering with effective attractive and repulsive interaction strengths becoming of the same order of magnitude at @xmath91 . while the peak does not shift substantially by varying the strength of the intermolecular forces the height of the peak turns out to be rather sensitive to those strength hence , to the size of the quasiparticle . as an example , by doubling @xmath99 with respect to the value in fig.2 ( at fixed @xmath61 and @xmath100 ) , the normalized resistivity peak ( @xmath101 curve ) drops to 0.65 while by taking @xmath102 the peak disappears .",
    "the effect of the second neighbors force constant is relatively less strong : by doubling @xmath100 ( at fixed @xmath61 and @xmath99 ) with respect to fig.2 , the resistivity maximum becomes 0.76 while @xmath103 yields a peak value of 0.66 .    at larger @xmath26 s",
    "the resonance peak is higher and broader since an increasing number of incoming polarons can be off diagonally scattered by the tls .",
    "however , the appearance of this many body effect mediated by the local potential does not change the position of the peak either , which instead can be shifted towards lower temperatures by reducing substantially @xmath61 hence the @xmath4 value . in fig.3 , we set @xmath104 . as previously discussed @xcite the intermolecular coupling @xmath99 should be @xmath105 to ensure a correct application of the molecular lattice model with first neighbors interacting sites .",
    "here we are extending the range of the forces to the second neighbors shell accordingly , @xmath99 is slightly reduced to the value @xmath106 while @xmath100 is switched on and fixed at @xmath107 .",
    "this choice of parameters allows us : i ) to treat correctly the ground state polaron properties versus dimensionality @xcite , ii ) to set the characteristic phonon frequency of the present three dimensional lattice model at @xmath108 which is the energy of c - axis polarized phonons due to apical oxygen vibrations coupled to the holes in the cu - o planes of @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "although our simple cubic lattice does not account for the details of the structural effects of @xmath110 we are in the appropriate range of parameters to capture the main features of the lattice polarons scattered by local instabilities in those compounds .",
    "anharmonic features of the oxygen modes have been recognized to be larger in underdoped samples @xcite and doping dependent polaron formation @xcite has been correlated to distortions of the oxygen environment .",
    "our model predicts ( fig.3 ) a large resisitivity peak whose height is strongly increased with respect to fig.2 ( compare the @xmath111 cases ) due to the fact that the polaron effective mass is heavier when lower energy phonons build up the quasiparticle . the non metallic behavior at @xmath46 larger than @xmath112 reminds of the anomalous c - axis resistivity observed in underdoped high @xmath5 superconductors @xcite .",
    "we believe that the semiconducting like @xmath113 in underdoped high @xmath5 superconductors can be ascribed to anharmonic potentials due to oxygen displacements strongly coupled via @xmath26 ( as in fig.3 ) to polaronic carriers . to attempt a comparison with experiments we need to fix the residual resistivity through the ground state parameters given in eq.(7 ) . by extrapolating to @xmath114",
    "the normal state data on @xmath109 one derives @xmath115 , hence the experimental peak value @xmath116 observed in the 80k compound @xmath117 @xcite can be reproduced in my model by @xmath118 which corresponds to a local mode energy of @xmath119 , in fair agreement with the measured energies of phonons strongly coupled to the charge carriers .    in the range @xmath120",
    "the @xmath118 curve fits rather well the data of ref .",
    "@xcite . at @xmath121 ,",
    "the experimental @xmath122 is @xmath123 and the calculated value is @xmath124 . in the range @xmath125 ,",
    "the experimental @xmath122 is essentially flat while my results still exhibit a @xmath126 behavior . in general , the resistivities here obtained have an exponential temperature dependence ( at @xmath46 larger than the resonance ) consistent with a polaronic hopping motion whereas the experimental data show a variety of sample dependent non metallic behaviors for the out of plane resistivity @xcite in underdoped compounds .",
    "a resistivity peak at @xmath127 is observed in cmr materials @xcite and a splitting of the mn states due to a local lattice distortion has been proposed as a possible mechanism . in our description , only extended polarons dragging a cloud of high frequency optical phonons ( see fig.4 ) can produce a peak at @xmath128 which is however broader than the experimental one .",
    "high phonon frequencies imply reduced mass renormalization and , consistently , weak overall electron - phonon coupling values . extended polarons move therefore in wide energy bands and the resonance effect",
    "can take place only if the tls splitting energy is large enough .",
    "infact , by taking @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( fig.4 ) , we get the peak at @xmath131 whereas , in a small polaron regime ( @xmath1 ) the resonance is lost and the peak is suppressed .",
    "although more specific models accounting for magnetic field effects are required for the cmr systems , we argue that the strong coupling of polarons to structural distortions is likely relevant to their transport properties .",
    "the path integral method provides a powerful tool to describe _ non local ( in time ) _ scattering of the charge carriers by _ local ( in space ) _ potentials due to structural distortions .",
    "our charge carriers are lattice polarons which exist in the diatomic molecular lattice by virtue of a sizeable overall electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the structural instability is due to an anharmonic atomic motion between two equilibrium positions which typically could be @xmath132 apart .",
    "i have derived the full partition function of the interacting system and obtained the temperature dependent effective couplings by summing over the class of energetically favored atomic hopping paths .",
    "we suggest that the retarded nature of the interactions is the _ key _ ingredient to explain some anomalous transport properties observed in real materials .",
    "a resistivity peak is obtained as a consequence of resonant scattering of polarons strongly coupled to local double well potentials .",
