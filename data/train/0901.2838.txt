    "pa ) @xcite for the binary erasure channel ( bec ) .",
    "pa is an iterative algorithm which is defined on tanner graphs .",
    "pa and brief propagation ( bp ) decoder have the same decoding result . as pa proceeds , edges and nodes are progressively removed .",
    "the residual graphs consist of nodes and edges that are still unknown at each iteration .",
    "the decoding successfully halts if the graph vanishes .",
    "amraoui @xcite showed that distributions of the number of check nodes of degree one in the residual graph convergences weakly to a gaussian as blocklength tends to infinity .",
    "amraoui also showed that block and bit error probability of finite - length ldpc codes are derived by the average and the variance of the number of check nodes of degree one in the residual graph .",
    "the average number of check nodes of degree one in the residual graph is determined from a system of differential equations , which was derived and solved by luby et al .",
    "the variance of the number of check nodes of degree one in the residual graph is also determined from a system of differential equations called _ covariance evolution _ , which was derived by amraoui et al .",
    "since analytical solution of covariance evolution has not been known so far , we had to resort to numerical computations to solve the covariance evolution .    an alternative way to determine the variance of the number of check nodes of degree one",
    "was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the variance of the number of check nodes of degree one in the residual graph can be computed by determining the variance of the number of erased messages of bp for bec with parameter @xmath0 where @xmath0 is the threshold of the ensemble under bp decoding .",
    "this method is a valid approximation for the erasure probability close to @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , ezri et al .  extended to this method to more general channels @xcite . however",
    ", if we solve the covariance evolution analytically , we can derive the variance of the number of check nodes of degree one in the residual graph for all @xmath2 where @xmath2 is the channel parameter for the bec .    in this paper",
    ", we show an analytical solution of the covariance evolution for regular ldpc code ensembles .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the covariance evolution and _ initial covariance _ in @xcite .",
    "we consider the transmission over the bec with channel erasure probability @xmath3 using ldpc codes in a ( @xmath4 , @xmath5)-regular ldpc code ensemble .",

    "the initial conditions of the covariance evolution are given by initial covariances .",
    "the initial covariances are the covariances of the number of edges of each degree at the start of the decoding divided by the total number of edges in the original graph . for @xmath39 , initial covariances",
