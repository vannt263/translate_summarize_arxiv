    "the measurement of the vector magnetic field in solar prominences has become a prioritary goal to improve our understanding of the solar corona and its evolution .",
    "the long - term stability of quiescent prominences ( from several days to several weeks ) suggests that these structures of the solar atmosphere must be associated with a highly ordered topology of the magnetic field , right at the interface between the solar corona and the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "this long - term stability is not easily disrupted , despite the fact that the visible structure of quiescent prominences appears to be continually affected by highly dynamical events , like rising large - scale voids ( _ bubbles _ ) and ascending and descending small - scale plumes @xcite .",
    "this is rather strong evidence that the stability of solar prominences  and its sudden disruption , when a quiescent prominence eventually erupts , leading to a coronal mass ejection ( cme)must somehow involve the magnetic topology of a much larger volume of the solar atmosphere than the actual visible structure , extending also to the prominence cavity and the corona above .",
    "that is why a concerted effort for measuring the magnetic field vector in prominences and in the solar corona is fundamental for the ultimate goal of understanding the manifestation of energetic events in the heliosphere , which are the main driver of space weather .    on the other hand ,",
    "measurements of magnetic fields in prominences and in the corona are difficult .",
    "they impose very strict requirements on the instrumentation , and they require a deep understanding of the mechanisms of formation of line scattering polarization in a magnetized plasma . for this reason ,",
    "only very recently the possibility of performing routine measurements of magnetic fields in prominences and in the corona has been given serious consideration , and new anticipated large - scale instruments ( atst , est , cosmo , solar - c ) are being developed specifically with this goal in mind .    on the interpretational side , the number of lines that are good diagnostics of prominence and coronal magnetic fields is quite restricted . for prominences ,",
    "the primary choice has converged , over the past two or three decades , to the two lines of at 587.6 nm ( d@xmath0 ) and 1083.0 nm ( 10830 ) .",
    "these two lines have been used at different times for studies of prominence magnetism @xcite .",
    "the long experience of the solar community in the magnetic inversion of photospheric lines has clearly demonstrated the advantage of multi - line polarimetric observations .",
    "the mtr observing mode available at the thmis telescope @xcite is perfectly suited to accomplish such multi - line , spectro - polarimetric observations .",
    "moreover , the implementation of optimized modulators , of new detectors with better efficiency in the near - infrared , and the use of the grid method of @xcite , allow since 2006 for the simultaneous and co - spatial observations of the two multiplets of in prominences .",
    "the hao - ncar prominence magnetometer ( promag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is near completion , was specifically designed for this type of multi - line diagnostics .",
    "it remains to prove that , for the specific case of the two lines , such diverse - wavelength diagnostics of prominence magnetism is indeed feasible , and that it would increase the reliability of the magnetic inversions .",
    "this is the motivation for the study presented in this paper .",
    "the feasibility of such multi - line approach to magnetic - field measurements in quiescent prominences is demonstrated through its preliminary application to simultaneous and co - spatial observations of these lines from thmis .",
    "thereafter , in order to demonstrate the robustness of this diagnostics , we performed a statistical analysis of the inversion errors over several databases of simulated observations .",
    "this analysis clearly shows the significance of the improvement in magnetic - field inversion by using both chromospheric lines .",
    "first four pca eigenprofiles ( rows 2 to 5 ) for the four stokes parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , from column 1 to 4 , respectively ) of the chromospheric lines 10830 ( left profiles ) and d@xmath0 ( right profiles ) formed in an environment typical of quiescent prominences .",
    "the first row shows the mean stokes profiles averaged over the entire parameter space spanned by our problem . the determination of the pca eigenbasis from the merging of the spectral information of the two lines allows a clearer understanding of the physical correlations between the two lines with regards to the formation of their polarization signatures . ]",
    "the approach to magnetic inversion of line scattering polarization by principal component analysis ( pca ) of the stokes profiles has been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the inversion is performed by minimizing an appropriate euclidean norm ( _ pca distance _ ) , which measures the deviation of the fitting profiles from the observations .",
    "this minimization is performed in the `` dual space '' of the pca coefficients , which are the projections of the stokes profiles onto a basis of _ eigenprofiles _ previously determined for the problem at hand .",
    "since the pca inversion is performed by searching for the best match of the observed profiles within a precomputed database of models , this method is very fast , and in addition is free from the risk of converging to local minima of the pca distance .",
    "another advantage of the pca approach to stokes inversion is that all the essential spectro - polarimetric information about the line formation process , which is needed for a reliable inference of the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the emitting plasma , is often encoded within a rather restricted set of eigenprofiles ( typically between 3 and 6 components for each stokes parameter , depending on the complexity of the line formation model ) .",
    "in fact , the most significant ( i.e. , low - order ) pca eigenprofiles often present patterns that can be directly ascribed to specific physical mechanisms intervening in the line formation process @xcite .",
    "thus the inspection of the eigenprofiles can help identify which mechanisms are at work in a particular polarized line profile .",
    "often this identification is obvious , but sometimes the eigenprofiles can reveal the presence of correlations between spectral signatures that may not be evident in the original line profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : eigenvectors ] shows the first few pca eigenprofiles for the two chromospheric lines .",
    "these were computed after merging the spectral information from the two lines into a fictitious single spectrum .",
    "this allows us to reveal correlations of polarized spectral features between the two lines , which we can reasonably expect must be present also in the line profiles of 10830 and d@xmath0 formed under realistic conditions , but which may not be as evident from a study of the separate sets of eigenprofiles for the two lines .    the four columns in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvectors ] show the pca components of the stokes parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the first row shows the mean profiles averaged over the entire parameter space .",
    "as the magnetic field can attain all possible orientations , the average @xmath6 and @xmath7 stokes profiles tend to zero , as expected .",
    "in fact , the good approximation to zero of those signals , as illustrated by fig .  [",
    "fig : eigenvectors ] , is an indication of the good coverage of the parameter space provided by the original database of line profiles , which was used for the determination of the pca eigenbasis .",
    "the successive rows give the first 4 orders of the pca stokes eigenvectors . here",
    "we point out the most relevant features of these plots , which can give us a deeper insight in the formation mechanism of the two chromospheric lines .",
    "the 1st - order , @xmath5 and @xmath6 eigenvectors show that , to lowest order , the modifications of the scattering linear polarization in the model ( due to variations in the radiation anisotropy , and to the magnetic hanle effect ) are positively correlated between the two lines ( i.e. , both polarization increase or decrease under the same physical mechanism ) .",
    "this fundamental trend is only modified at higher order , as demonstrated by the 3rd - order eigenvectors ( 4th row of plots ) showing a negative correlation between the linear - polarization signatures of the two lines . at that same order , the stokes",
    "@xmath7 eigenprofile shows the unmistakable signature of atomic orientation in d@xmath0 ( due to the alignment - to - orientation mechanism ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that almost no signal is present for 10830 in such case . in other words ,",
    "if a physical condition existed in a quiescent prominence , such that the resulting stokes @xmath7 of d@xmath0 were completely due to atomic orientation , then one should expect to see a negligibly small stokes @xmath7 signal for the 10830 line formed in the same region of the prominence .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous and co - spatial observation of such a peculiar stokes @xmath7 profile in d@xmath0 _ and _ of a sizable ( zeeman ) stokes @xmath7 profile in 10830 would imply that the formation regions for the two lines can not be the same , a possibility that currently is not contemplated by our inversion model .",
    "so the 3rd - order , stokes-@xmath7 eigenprofile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvectors ] provides an interesting proxy of non - standard line formation scenarios for the chromospheric lines of . on the other hand , the 1st - order , stokes-@xmath7 eigenprofile shows that the dominant contribution to stokes @xmath7 for both lines , in our model , is in fact due to the zeeman effect .",
    "this is easily explained by the fact that , in our parameter space , we considered field strengths up to 200 g , which are well beyond the level - crossing regime for d@xmath0 ( 3040 g ) , at which the alignment - to - orientation mechanism is most effective in the @xmath8d term of .    in extending our pca code @xcite to multi - line inversion ,",
    "the database creation was modified so that each line s database is calculated for exactly the same set of magnetic and plasma models .",
    "this decision was made in order to minimize the effects of the discrete nature of the pca database , and also to eliminate inversion artifacts due to the presence of ambiguous magnetic configurations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we then introduced a generalized pca distance @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of spectral lines in the model ( for the currently adopted model of , @xmath11 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath12 is the pca distance for the @xmath13-th line , and @xmath14 is a factor ranging between 0 and 1 .",
    "this last quantity ( which at this time is being fixed before the inversion ) allows to switch on and off the inversion of a given line , or to give different weights to the lines that are being inverted .",
    "the simultanoues pca inversion of multiple spectral lines thus requires the minimization of the generalized pca distance defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : distance ] ) .",
    "one could alternatively use the eigenprofiles of fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvectors ] for the inversion of simultaneous spectro - polarimetric data in the two chromospheric lines of , with the advantage of dealing with only one database of pca coefficients and one pca distance for both lines .",
    "since the quality of the inversion is independent of the choice of the eigenprofile basis , this alternate approach is totally legitimate . on the other hand",
    ", this would require the preliminary treatment of all spectro - polarimetric data to merge the information from the two lines into fictitious stokes profiles analogous to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigenvectors ] .",
    "an important advantage in keeping separate databases for each line is that it easily allows for the testing of different combinations of lines for magnetic inversion .",
    "this is the main argument in favor of our approach to multi - line pca inversion based on the minimization of a multi - line pca distance as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : distance ] ) .",
    "we preliminarly applied our multi - line pca inversion code to simultaneous and co - spatial observations of the two chromospheric lines in a quiescent prominence , which were acquired in june 2007 at thmis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : themis ] ) .",
    "this application to only a few spatial points of the prominence has obviously no relevance for an improved understanding of the magnetic topology of these solar structures .",
    "however , the successful fit of these simultaneous , multi - line observations marks an important advance in the spectro - polarimetric diagnostics of scattering polarization , confirming the feasibility of multi - line inversion for magnetic studies of solar prominences .",
    "this result strongly advocates for a consistent design of future solar instrumentation that allow multi - line observations of chromospheric lines at the solar limb .",

    "such a large size of the database is needed in order to mitigate the contribution to the inversion errors coming from the discrete nature of the database .",
    "so we can anticipate that the inversion errors in our tests are dominated by the intrinsic uncertainties ( ambiguities ) in the polarized line formation of the lines in prominences .",
    "next we created three different datasets of synthetic observations , each with 5000 models , to be inverted against the pca database .",
    "one of the datasets spans the same parameter ranges given above .",

    "it is evident that , on average , d@xmath0 performs significantly better than 10830 in inferring the vector magnetic field information over the entire parameter space .",

    ", we report the widths of the error distribution containing 50% and 90% of the inverted models , respectively .    figures  [ fig : lowb ] and [ fig : highb ] show similar results for the inversion of the two observation databases created on a restricted range ( 10 g wide ) of magnetic field strengths .",
    "we see that 10830 provides most of the information that is needed for the inference of weak fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowb ] ) . instead , d@xmath0 carries more information for larger field strength , as indicated by the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : highb ] .",
    "this is in general agreement with the fact that the critical field strength for the hanle effect increases by nearly an order of magnitude going from 10830 to d@xmath0 , where 10830 is sensitive to fields between approximately 0.1 and 10 g .",
    "it is important to notice that , for all three cases depicted in figures  [ fig : full_range][fig : highb ] , the simultaneous inversions of the two lines give consistently the smallest errors at both the 50% and 90% confidence levels .",
    "all the errors shown in the histograms of figures  [ fig : full_range][fig : highb ] are summarized in table  [ tab : errors ] .    in all the inversions ,",
    "the 90% error on the position angle of the magnetic field projection on the plane of the sky , @xmath34 , is always dominated by errors close to @xmath35 , because of the well - known @xmath35 ambiguity of polarization measurements .",

    "[ fig : full_range ] and [ fig : highb ] .",
    "these are determined by the behavior of resonance scattering polarization in the asymptotic regime of the hanle effect for 10830 @xcite .",
    "d@xmath0 is much less affected by such @xmath1 ambiguity , for this specific range of field strengths .",
    "however , it is interesting to note how the simultaneous inversion of 10830 and d@xmath0 further reduces the probability of inversion errors associated with the @xmath1 ambiguity .",
    "the complexity of magnetic diagnostics in solar prominences , where the observed polarization is dominated by scattering processes , poses particularly strong demands on the robustness of the inversion strategy .",
    "one would greatly profit from using multi - line diagnostics , but the feasibility and reliability of such an approach in the case of scattering - dominated , non - lte , radiative transfer had yet to be demonstrated . in this paper",
    ", we took on this task , and considered in particular the simultaneous inversion of the chromospheric lines at 587.6 nm and 1083.0 nm .",
    "we performed a statistical study of magnetic - field inference in solar prominences through pca - based , multi - line inversion , as applied to simultaneous observations of the d@xmath0 and 10830 .",
    "the statistical analysis of the inversion errors on the inferred vector magnetic field was conducted on a database of simulated observations of the two lines .",
    "our analysis confirmed that d@xmath0 carries the greatest diagnostic content for typical average fields of quiescent prominences ( @xmath36 g and higher ) , but also demonstrated that the added information carried by the polarization signatures of 10830 significantly improves the determination of the magnetic field geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "10830 is fundamental for the vector measurement of weak magnetic field ( @xmath31 g ) , although the use of both lines is even more important for the overall reduction of the inversion errors on both field strength and geometry in this case .",
    "we also demonstrated the applicability of such diagnostics to real data , by inverting some recent simultaneous and co - spatial observations of a quiescent prominence , which were taken with thmis in the two chromospheric lines and in h@xmath37 .",
    "although we did not put any emphasis on the interpretation of those observations , the fact that real data are indeed amenable to such multi - line diagnostics allows us to extends the results of our error analysis of multi - line pca inversion to future observations of quiescent prominences .",
