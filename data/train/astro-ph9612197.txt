    "the consistency of the observed light element abundances with the predictions of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is a fundamental source of evidence for a hot big - bang@xcite . over the last thirty years , the abundances of the light isotopes @xmath3h , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 have all been found to be consistent with the primordial levels predicted by bbn over a fairly narrow range of the baryon - to - photon ratio of the universe , @xmath7 : @xmath8 ( see , _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fact that there is such a range of concordance , for abundances spanning more than nine orders of magnitude , is taken as evidence that bbn gives a correct description of the origin of the light elements .",
    "this concordance interval also provides a measure of the baryonic contribution to the total mass density of the universe , @xmath9 , as obtained from the constraints on @xmath7 , and where @xmath10 denotes the value of the hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "inferring primordial abundances of elements is a tricky business , and it seems fair to say that at the present time , the constraints on the baryon density are limited by the systematic errors on the observed or inferred abundances @xcite . in this regard , an additional light isotope could further firm up bbn , and might provide new constraints on @xmath7 .",
    "the only remaining candidate that could in principle be brought into the framework of homogeneous bbn is @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 has the next - highest predicted primordial abundance , after those species already understood in the bbn framework .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) like beryllium and boron , present day @xmath11 is thought to be produced mostly by cosmic ray spallation in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the meteoritic abundance of @xmath0 is certainly much higher ( by a factor @xmath12 ) than even the most optimistic primordial abundance predicted by standard bbn .",
    "however , it is possible that the levels of this isotope in hot @xmath136000 - 6300 k , extreme low - metallicity halo stars ( either main - sequence dwarfs or subgiants near the turn - off point ) could reflect its primordial abundance .",
    "this would show up as a flattening of the curve of @xmath0 _ vs. _ metallicity at the point where the abundance of cosmic - ray - produced @xmath0 becomes comparable to the abundance of primordial @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig : evolution ] ) .",
    "such a situation appears to hold for @xmath6 , whose abundances in low - metallicity halo stars are uniform over a wide range of metallicities and a narrow range of temperatures , the so - called spite plateau @xcite .    at present , there have been only three relatively uncertain detections of @xmath2li in such low - metallicity stars , one of them being marginal @xcite .",
    "the metallicities of these stars where @xmath2li has been observed , roughly [ fe / h]@xmath14=log@xmath15 , where the subscript @xmath16 refers to abundances measured at the birth of the sun ] , are unfortunately not low enough for any primordial component to be observable . however , as new data come in , and as new instruments that are able to reach lower metallicities and lower @xmath0 abundance levels eventually come on line , it is of interest to know what levels of primordial @xmath0 we might expect to see , and to what extent they could provide constraints on the baryon density .    .25 in    thomas _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have examined the bbn predictions for the primordial abundance of @xmath2li .",
    "these authors have not discussed in detail , however , the extremely large uncertainties on this prediction , as they were mainly concerned with both homogeneous and non - homogeneous nucleosynthesis yields of beryllium and boron",
    ". predictions of primordial abundances are made by numerically integrating rate equations for nuclear reactions that occurred during the first few minutes of the big bang , and for @xmath2li , the uncertainties on the yields are directly related to uncertainties on the input reaction rates . therefore , we first examine the status of relevant cross - section measurements and identify the chief sources of uncertainty .",
    "we then discuss the prediction of the @xmath2li primordial abundance , and we examine to what extent primordial @xmath2li could be observed .",
    "we argue that even in the most optimistic case , this observation is not within reach of present instrumental capabilities , but must be subjected to future techniques . in particular , we discuss how a direct measurement of the @xmath17 radiative capture cross - section , at the low energies where this reaction takes place during bbn , @xmath1860  400 kev , could have a profound impact on the predictions .",
    "in fact , the present uncertainty on the @xmath2li yield is so large that even if @xmath2li were detected in very metal - poor stars , at metallicities of about [ fe / h]@xmath19 , this would not allow a sensible constraint on the baryonic density parameter .",
    "however , an eventual measurement of the primordial @xmath2li abundance , at a predicted level ( @xmath2li / h)@xmath20 , would in any case provide another fundamental test of modern cosmology .",
    "the primordial abundance of @xmath0 is determined almost entirely by the rates of two reactions .",
    "these reactions are radiative capture of deuterium on alpha particles , @xmath1 , which produces practically all of the @xmath0 , and the @xmath0 _ destroying _ reaction @xmath21 .",
    "we examine below the current status of these reaction rates .",
    ".75 in      the low - energy ( 100 kev @xmath231000 kev ) cross - section for this reaction is sufficiently well - known that recent work @xcite has concentrated on determining the effects of electron screening in the experimental target at extremely low energies ( @xmath24 kev ) via comparison with the higher - energy cross section .",
    "the energy range that concerns us here is the range in which the peaks of the coulomb barrier penetration factor and of the maxwell - boltzmann thermal velocity distribution overlap significantly at bbn temperatures .",
    "it is in this range , where there is a population of protons with enough thermal energy to penetrate the coulomb barriers of the @xmath25li ions , that the reaction takes place .",

    "@xcite for a detailed discussion . ) in the case of @xmath26 , this corresponds to energies of @xmath27 75  410 kev at a temperature of @xmath28k at the beginning of bbn or @xmath29 30  80 kev at a temperature of @xmath30k , when the @xmath2li abundance has stabilized .    for purposes of fitting curves to experimental cross section data and integrating them to obtain reaction rates , it is customary to use the astrophysical s - factor , defined by removing the coulomb barrier factor and a geometric factor from the cross section : @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is energy , @xmath33 is the reaction cross section , and and @xmath34 is the gamow energy , @xmath35 for reactants of reduced mass @xmath36 and atomic number @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "the s - factor is particularly convenient for fitting because it is often a much slower function of @xmath32 than the cross section is .",
    "( for the procedure used to derive a reaction rate from the astrophysical s - factor , see ref.@xcite . )",
    "we have computed a new analytic expression for the @xmath26 reaction rate using a new polynomial fit to the experimental s - factor between 100 and 1000 kev .",
    "( see table [ table : rates ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : p - a ] . ) in addition , we present the s - factor curve corresponding to the rate found in the compilation of harris _ et al .",
    "following engstler _",
    "et al._@xcite , we use only the data above 100 kev in the fit to avoid the effects of electron screening .",
    "unlike their fit , ours includes their data in addition to previous data .",
    "our reaction rate is lower than that of harris _ et al .",
    "_ by a factor of about 15% .",
    "treating all errors as statistical in our least - squares fit to the cross - section data gives a @xmath39 error of 5% in overall normalization ( based on the fitting error at 100 kev , an energy relevant to bbn ) .",
    "an estimated @xmath40 error of 15% includes all of the lowest data points except those of fiedler and kunze @xcite , which were not used in the fit , and which seem to be normalized differently from the rest of the data .",
    "we will use this rather extreme estimate to determine upper limits on the @xmath0 yield . from this estimate",
    ", we still find the uncertainty in this reaction rate to be insignificant in comparison to uncertainties in the main @xmath0-producing reaction rate .",
    "( see below . )      in contrast , the low - energy cross section for radiative capture of a deuteron by an alpha particle to form @xmath0 is almost completely unknown . theoretical calculations ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) vary over a factor of about ten .",
    "experimental measurements are difficult because of the extremely small cross sections involved ; electric dipole radiation is strongly suppressed because the nearly equal charge - to - mass ratios of the deuteron and alpha particle give the @xmath42 system a very small dipole moment in all cases .",
    "this requires the radiative capture to proceed mostly via electric quadrupole radiation , and thus mostly through the @xmath43-wave portion of the incoming wavefunction .    to date",
    ", there have been three experiments to directly measure cross - sections for @xmath42 radiative capture .",
    "the only recent direct measurement of the nonresonant cross section , used in the current standard low - energy extrapolation @xcite , is that of robertson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who measured the reaction cross section at center - of - mass energies of 13.5 mev .",
    "the experiment of mohr _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite concentrated on the @xmath44 resonance at 711 mev .",
    "by contrast , the energies relevant to @xmath11 production in the big bang are in the range 30  400 kev . the recent experiment of cecil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , has determined an upper limit ( at 90% confidence level ) for the cross section at 53 kev .",
    "unfortunately , this limit is much higher than any current theoretical estimate of the cross section at 53 kev , so the actual reaction rate may be much lower  by a factor of fifty or so  than the limit implied by this measurement .",
    "( see fig.[fig : d - a ] . )",
    ".3 in    in recent years , an attempt has been made to get around the difficulty of measuring very small radiative - capture cross sections by studying coulomb breakup of the product nucleus as an inverse reaction @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "@xmath0 nuclei are rutherford - scattered off some high - z nucleus .",
    "some of these scattered nuclei are broken up into a deuterons and alpha particles by the electric - field gradient of the heavy nucleus .",
    "this process has been treated as the absorption of a virtual photon , and thus as an inverse radiative capture @xcite . however , a number of difficulties arise in treating the data @xcite which produce additional uncertainties in this approach , mostly because contributions from the various partial waves are not the same in coulomb breakup as they are in radiative capture .",
    "one group @xcite reports anomalous angular dependence in the data .",
    "the cross sections inferred from the breakup measurements of kiener _",
    "@xcite are significantly higher than any of the theoretical estimates , perhaps suggesting interference from the nuclear force , even at small scattering angles , or perhaps supporting a higher than anticipated low - energy cross section .",
    "it is clear from the conflicting theoretical curves that a reliable determination of the reaction rate for @xmath42 radiative capture will require a direct cross section measurement below the @xmath45 resonance . while the cross section was too small to be measured at 53 kev ( an alpha particle energy of 160 kev ) , the expected cross section should exceed this limit slightly higher in the range of energies @xmath4650  400 kev relevant to bbn ( alpha bombarding energies of @xmath46150  1200 kev ) so that it can be measured in similar experiments . in the absence of any evidence to allow a decision between the various theoretical and experimental extrapolations , we will use a few representative results to see how large a spread is allowed .",
    "it should be kept in mind that these cross - sections are only representative values selected from the literature , where it is difficult to choose between conflicting results .",
    "( note , for example , that in the same paper where they calculate one of the cross sections used here , ryzhikh _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also obtain significantly different results by expanding the @xmath0 ground state in different sets of basis functions . )",
    "we will also use the cecil _ et al._@xcite value as an extreme upper limit , setting the nonresonant s - factor constant at the 53 kev limit of @xmath47 mev@xmath48b for energies below the 711 kev resonance .    using the measurement of the resonant cross section due to mohr _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite",
    ", we also present a new value of the contribution to the reaction rate from the 711 kev resonance . using the methods described in @xcite , the resonant contribution is @xmath49 this is a fairly small change from the customary value , given in robertson _",
    "et al.,_@xcite and it does not have a significant effect on the rate at bbn temperatures or on the bbn @xmath11 yields .",
    ".25 in      eleven other reactions in the bbn reaction network @xcite involve @xmath0 ( see table [ table : rates ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] ) .",
    "however , neither removing these reactions ( individually ) from the reaction network nor augmenting them by large factors changes the final @xmath0 abundance by more than one tenth of a percent .",
    "the effect of any uncertainty in these rates is certainly swamped by the uncertainties in the rates of the more crucial reactions discussed above , so we pass over them .",
    "note , in particular , the reaction @xmath50 , which has generally been omitted from bbn studies , has only a very small effect on the @xmath0 yield @xcite , so its uncertainty was safely ignored .",
    "we predicted @xmath0 yields for various values of the relevant reaction rates using kawano s version @xcite of the standard nucleosynthesis code and the full network of thomas _ et al_@xcite .",
    "we were particularly interested in establishing upper limits for the primordial @xmath0 abundance to determine whether it is possible in principle for primordial @xmath0 to contribute a significant fraction of the @xmath0 abundance at low metallicity .",
    "the uncertainty in the primordial abundance of @xmath0 depends only weakly on the @xmath0-destroying proton capture reaction considered in section [ sec : p - alpha ] above . holding all other rates at their standard values , a 20% increase in this rate decreases the @xmath0 yield by 10% ; a 20% decrease in this rate increases the @xmath0 yield by @xmath51% . as discussed above , the @xmath40 uncertainty in this reaction rate",
    "is probably less than 20% .",
    "therefore , uncertainties in this reaction rate have at most a small role to play in determining the possibility of observing primordial @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 yield on normalization of the @xmath52 radiative capture rate is very nearly linear at all values of the normalization .",
    "given the wide range of predictions for the reaction rates and the extreme upper limit from @xcite , there is a wide range of possible @xmath0 yields . depending on the low - energy extrapolation used ,",
    "the maximum possible primordial ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath6 varies from 0.01% ( @xmath53 ) to 0.18% ( @xmath54 ) , while the extreme upper limit on this ratio derived from the cecil _ et al . _",
    "limit on the @xmath42 cross section and our lower limit on the @xmath55 cross section is as high as 3.7% ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] .",
    "the maximum always occurs at @xmath56 , the extreme low end of the concordance interval allowed by standard bbn @xcite .",
    "these results are in agreement with those of ref.@xcite , who found an upper limit on the primordial ratio @xmath2li/@xmath57li@xmath58% in all cases they considered .    because @xmath0 yields fall rapidly with increasing baryon density",
    ", @xmath0 is potentially a very sensitive probe of the baryon density .",
    "however , a direct measurement of the @xmath59 reaction cross section at low energy will be necessary before any such claims can be made . in the meantime , it is obvious that a detection of primeval @xmath2li at a level consistent with the above estimations would provide a new piece of evidence for the consistency of bbn , and hence a fundamental cosmological test . while a precise baryon density determination from @xmath25li is not possible without a better rate for @xmath17 ,",
    "it is clear that a measureable primordial component of @xmath25li would argue for a value of @xmath7 near the lower end of the allowed range .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : abundances ] . )",
    "this is also the range of @xmath7 implied by the extragalactic deuterium measurements of rugers and hogan @xcite , but it would be in conflict with the the lower d / h ( higher @xmath7 ) values implied by the work of tytler _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the highest value of the @xmath0/@xmath6 ratio may allow something like the `` spite plateau '' of @xmath6 to exist for @xmath0 at extremely low metallicities .",
    "it was argued in ref.@xcite that @xmath2li / h should scale as @xmath60o / h all along the galactic evolution , taking into account the trends observed for @xmath61be .",

    "@xmath63 should have a slope unity in the halo phase , _",

    "fig : evolution ] ) . roughly speaking , since the meteoritic abundance of @xmath2li is @xmath67 at [ fe / h]@xmath68 .",
    ", one would expect the primordial @xmath2li plateau to show up at [ fe / h]@xmath69 if the primordial abundance is @xmath70(@xmath2li / h)@xmath71 , at [ fe / h]@xmath72 if @xmath70(@xmath2li / h)@xmath73 , and so forth .",
    "we note that the lower values of the reaction rate would result in @xmath2li yields so much lower than those expected from cosmic - ray spallation that they would not be observable even in the least - evolved stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the extreme upper limit on the @xmath42 cross section derived from the experiment of @xcite corresponds to an upper limit of the primordial @xmath0 abundance at about the level of previous detections .",
    "it is extremely difficult to detect the absorption due to the presence of @xmath2li in the photosphere of a metal - deficient star for the two following reasons : _",
    "( i ) _ the only resonance line of @xmath2lii at 6708  is usually blended with that of @xmath57lii since the isotopic separation is of the same order or smaller than the typical width of the lines ; _ ( ii ) _",
    "@xmath2li is strongly under - abundant compared to @xmath57li , especially at low metallicities where the abundance of @xmath57li is constant , of the order of the meteoritic abundance of @xmath2li , and the @xmath2li abundance goes down as the metallicity .",
    "the absorption of @xmath2li can therefore be seen only as a slight asymmetry of the @xmath57li absorption line profile .",
    "nonetheless , two detections of @xmath2li have probably been achieved at metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath74 and [ fe / h]@xmath75 , at a level @xmath2li/@xmath57li@xmath76% @xcite .",
    "the main limiting factors for these detections were the signal - to - noise ratio and the spectral resolution achieved by the instruments .",
    "however , the accuracy of the measured value was limited equally by the noise in the observed spectrum ( statistical error ) and by the accuracy of the determination of the velocity broadening parameter ( systematics ) , which defines the width of the lithium lines .",
    "this parameter , due to stellar rotation and macro - turbulent motions in the atmosphere , is constrained from the profile fitting of other lines , such as fei and cai @xcite . therefore , in order to reach very low @xmath2li/@xmath57li ratios in metal - poor stars , one has to considerably diminish the statistical noise , and , at the same time , to carefully control systematics .    concerning the statistical accuracy , we note , as a reference , that the most precise measurement of the @xmath2li/@xmath57li ratio was carried out in the star hd84937 , of magnitude m@xmath77 , in 1hr .",
    "integration time on the 2.7 m mcdonald telescope and coud spectrometer , at a resolving power @xmath78 , yielding @xmath2li/@xmath57li=5%@xmath792% ( statistical and systematics combined ) @xcite .",
    "the noise could be reduced by a factor of @xmath80 for an integration time @xmath4620hrs . on an instrument such as the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope , assuming equal efficiencies for the spectrometers . on future telescopes such as one 8 m reflector at the european southern observatory very large telescope , using the uves spectrograph , this factor",
    "could be brought up to @xmath81 for 20hrs . integration time . however",
    ", this factor would not compensate for the difference of magnitude for a star at very low metallicities , since a factor of 12 allows one to achieve the same signal - to - noise ratio on a star 2.7 magnitudes higher .",
    "indeed , hd84937 is a uniquely bright target ; in the very metal - poor star survey by beers , preston & shectman @xcite , we do not find any star brighter than @xmath82 , for [ fe / h]@xmath19 and a temperature of about @xmath836000 k , needed to ensure that @xmath2li has not been depleted ( _ i.e. _ destroyed and/or diluted ) too much .",
    "this survey is not complete yet , and one may still hope to find a suitable candidate . at the present time , however , the prospect of detecting @xmath2li at a level @xmath2li/@xmath57li@xmath84% does not seem realistic at metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath19 . only at the high values of @xmath2li/@xmath57li @xmath85% allowed by the present experimental upper limit on deuterium - alpha capture of @xcite , could even undepleted primeval @xmath2li be detected with present instruments .",
    "regarding the systematics , it is unfortunately difficult to evaluate to what level these errors could be brought down .",
    "one would clearly have to increase the number of profiles studied to determine more accurately the theoretical line profile . in that frame , increasing the resolving power up to @xmath86 would help considerably , although an increase in spectral resolution is associated with a lower signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element .",
    "we examined possible @xmath0 abundances predicted by big - bang nucleosynthesis , and discussed the uncertainties in these predictions .",
    "the latter arise primarily from the uncertainties in the rate of the @xmath59 radiative capture reaction , which determines the final yield of @xmath2li .",
    "these uncertainties arise because this cross - section has never been measured directly at the relevant energies for big - bang production of @xmath2li , where the cross - section falls steeply with decreasing energy .",
    "uncertainties in theoretical estimates amount to roughly a factor 10 on the yield of @xmath2li , and , as such , would preclude putting severe constraints on the baryonic density parameter @xmath87 from @xmath2li alone , if a primeval component of @xmath2li were observed . the experimental upper limit of cecil _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also allows the @xmath2li yield to be considerably higher than allowed by any of these estimates , so that any constraint on @xmath87 from @xmath2li alone would be difficult to arrive at .",
    "however , since significant @xmath2li yields are favored by low baryon density and are strongly suppressed at high baryon density , regardless of the possible value of the production cross section , any detection of primordial @xmath2li would favor the low end of the current @xmath87 range from bbn .",
    "this would favor higher primordial @xmath88 values .",
    "thus , we emphasize that the detection of any primordial @xmath2li , to a level @xmath70(@xmath2li / h)@xmath89 , as obtained from our present calculations , would provide a new fundamental test of big - bang nucleosynthesis , hence of modern cosmology , and it could help resolve the current debate over which value of the extragalactic deuterium - to - hydrogen ratio is representative of the primordial value .",
    "finally , we caution that the prospect of detecting @xmath2li in the atmospheric layers of a very metal - deficient star ( pristine material ) , appears marginal with current instrumentation . with the present instruments available , and even for the larger instruments currently under construction , it seems that primordial @xmath2li could be detected , in stars with [ fe / h]@xmath19 , only near the extreme upper error bar of the @xmath42 reaction rate and the low end of the allowed baryon density , for which @xmath70(@xmath2li / h)@xmath90 .",
    "clearly , measurements of the @xmath42 cross section at relevant energies are crucial for deciding whether or not observational techniques should be pushed in this direction .",
