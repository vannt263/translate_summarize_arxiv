    ". there appear to be two distinct populations of grbs , distinguished by the duration of their prompt emission and their spectral properties @xcite , whereby long grbs ( prompt emissions lasting @xmath12  s  ) are typically softer than short grbs ( @xmath13  s ) @xcite . the most robust model for long",
    ", soft grbs is the collapsar model @xcite , in which a grb results from the energy released during the death of a massive star .",
    "evidence supporting this model includes the large number of long grbs located in regions of active star - formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "bipolar jets are a natural consequence of accretion onto a black hole and are observed in many high - energy astrophysical phenomena ( e.g.  agn , pulsars , micro - quasars ) , where the ejecta take the easiest exit path , along the rotational axis .",
    "a signature of highly relativistic jets is an achromatic break in the broadband afterglow light curves , caused by the expansion of the radiation beaming angle as the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath17 , decreases ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) . once the lorentz factor has decreased such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the half jet opening angle , the rate of decay increases , resulting in a break in the light curve .",
    "one of the scientific aims of the grb dedicated mission , _ swift _",

    "this may be an indication that jet breaks occur later than previously believed , at a time when the afterglow is no longer detected above the background level . in the x - ray band",

    "the cooling frequency is expected to evolve as @xmath54 for an ism - like circumburst environment ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , and as @xmath55 for a wind - like circumburst environment @xcite , and as it migrates through the observing energy band the drop in radiation at @xmath56 produces a break in the light curve .    to determine the @xmath57 lower limit on the time at which a jet or cooling break could have occurred , we applied a broken power law fit modelled on the cooling break , for which @xmath58 @xcite , and on a jet break , where @xmath59 @xcite , and in each case determined the earliest time that the break could occur within the observing time interval without deviating the goodness of fit by more than @xmath57 from the best - fit power law model .",
    "our analysis indicates that a cooling break could not have occurred earlier than @xmath60  s after the bat trigger to 99% confidence , and any jet break after the onset of the afterglow observations must have happened at @xmath61  s.    a power law fit to the early wt spectrum ( @xmath62t+600  s ) , where the galactic column density is fixed at @xmath63  @xmath64  @xcite , gives a best - fit host galaxy column density of @xmath65  @xmath64  at a redshift of @xmath66 for a spectral index @xmath67 .",

    "during the first white band exposure the source is so bright that relative photometry can be obtained using a very large aperture , which includes the wings of the point spread function , where coincidence loss is not a problem .",
    "the exposure was divided into 5  s bins , and source counts were obtained from an extraction region of radius @xmath92 . to calibrate this photometry , observations of the white dwarf standards gd50 and",
    "hz2 were taken with uvot and the white filter on october 18@xmath93 2006 . from these data we determined the relationship between observed count rate within the @xmath94 aperture and corrected count rate within a standard @xmath88 uvot source aperture , which we assume to be linear . to apply this calibration to grb  061007",
    "we apply constant offset to this relation to account for the different background count rate between the grb  061007 observations and the white dwarf standard count rate observations .",
    "this offset was chosen to match the mean white - band count rate in the saturated exposure to the white filter light curve extrapolated from later times ; we caution that calibration of this first white exposure is crude and thus the apparent steepening of the light curve towards the end of the exposure may not be real . however , the overall behaviour of a steadily decreasing count rate over the course of the exposure is not in doubt . for the first 400  s @xmath0-band exposure a higher resolution light curve",
    "was created by splitting it into 4  s bins , and the second into 20  s bins , consistent with the majority of the exposures during that time .    in order to get the best measurement of the optical temporal decay we created a single uv / optical light curve from all the uvot filters .",
    "to do this the light curve in each filter was individually fitted to find the corresponding normalisation , and this was then used to renormalised each light curve to the @xmath0-band .",
    "the combined uv and optical light curve , from t+85  s up to t+@xmath95  s , is best fit with a power law decay with temporal index @xmath3 .",

    "the magnitude along the left axis corresponds to the @xmath0-band , and the count rate along the right axis applies to the x - ray and @xmath4-ray light curves .",
    "the prompt emission from grb  061007 also triggered konus - wind and suzaku , and the afterglow was monitored by ground based telescopes , which carried out both spectroscopic and photometric observations .",
    "grb  061007 was measured to be at z=1.26 @xcite , for which the rest - frame isotropic energy release and maximum luminosity in the 20  kev10  mev is @xmath96  erg , and @xmath97  erg  s@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the optical afterglow was also detected by rotse at 26.4  s after the bat trigger at a magnitude of 13.6  mag in an unfiltered exposure @xcite , and the faulkes telescope south measured an @xmath98-band magnitude of @xmath99 142  s after the trigger @xcite , consistent with the uvot observations and indicative of a significant brightening during the first 90  s. the _ swift _",
    "observations from t+80  s show that by this time the afterglow had entered a constant power law decay ( see fig .",

    "s , after the last flare in the bat light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : batlc ] ) , the bat light curve appears to decay smoothly and monotonically out to @xmath43t+500  s , after which the flux becomes indistinguishable from the background in the bat energy range .",
    "a power law fit to the bat light curve from t+100  s to t+500  s provides an acceptable fit ( @xmath102 for 29 dof ) with a best - fit decay index of @xmath103 , which is consistent with the decay observed in both the uv / optical and x - ray light curves .",
    "furthermore , a power law spectral fit to this last part of the bat light curve , beyond @xmath43t+100  s , gives a best fit energy spectral index @xmath104 , in fairly good agreement with the spectral indices determined for the x - ray and optical afterglows .",
    "this supports a scenario in which the @xmath4-emission at this epoch is generated by the same radiation mechanism as the x - ray and uv / optical afterglow .",
    "using the full range of data available with _ swift _  an sed of the afterglow was produced using optical , x - ray and @xmath4-ray data , which were normalised to an instantaneous epoch at 600  s after the bat trigger . at this time",

    "the sed is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] .",
    "the lack of any break in the x - ray and uv / optical light curves up to @xmath60  s places the cooling frequency either above the x - ray band or below the optical at t+600  s. both energy bands will , therefore , have the same spectral index , and the sed was , thus , fit with a power law emission spectrum , and two dust and gas components were included to model the galactic and host galaxy photoelectric absorption and dust extinction .",

    "evidence of prolonged energy injection in the form of plateaus in x - ray light curves is observed in a large fraction of _ swift _  grbs , although typically up to @xmath11-@xmath196  s after the prompt emission . in the case of grb  061007 a steady energy injection",
    "is needed for at least an order of magnitude longer than this , during which no break is observed in the light curve .",

    "alternatively , the slow decay rate of the afterglow in the context of post jet - break could also be the result of a jet - edge effect in which there is no sideways expansion .",
    "in such a case the afterglow decay index would steepen by 3/4 when @xmath317 , and would continue to decay at this rate due to the lack of lateral expansion @xcite . in such a scenario there is no need for energy injection , although additional conditions would be required to prevent the jet from expanding further , such as a high magnetic field within the jet .",
    "a possibly more natural form of non - laterally expanding jet is a structured jet or outflow with an energy distribution that is a decreasing function of angular distance from the jet axis , @xmath318 , and a narrow , high - energy core at the axis .",
    "a jet break is , then , observed when the edge of the uniform inner core becomes visible to the observer , and it is , therefore , the viewing angle rather than the jet half - opening angle that determines the time of the jet break . in order for a jet break to occur before t+80  s the viewing angle needs to be close to the jet axis , which is not that unreasonable given the brightness of grb  061007 . at the time of jet break the smoother distribution in energy , @xmath319 , compared to a uniform jet results in a smaller change in the decay slope that will be shallower than the 3/4 increase in decay index observed in a uniform jet break . for a power law distribution of @xmath320 ,",
    "where @xmath321 , the smaller the value of @xmath322 the shallower the afterglow light curve will be after the jet - break . in the case of @xmath323 , where @xmath238 , a decay rate after a jet break with index @xmath324 will occur in structured jet with an @xmath320 distribution index @xmath325 , and for @xmath326 we require",
    "@xmath327 @xcite .",
    "a consequence of a very early jet break time is the faster evolution of @xmath17 into a non - relativistic phase , which will produce an additional break in the light curve as the decay rate slows down . for a uniform jet with no energy injection ,",
    "this break would occur at at a time @xmath328 @xcite . for @xmath234  s and @xmath329",
    ", the jet would , therefore , not enter the non - relativistic phase until more than @xmath330  s after the prompt emission , which is not in conflict with our observations , and in the presence of energy injection or for structured jets @xmath331 would only get larger .    in the context of post - jet break emission , a decay slope of @xmath324",
    "can , therefore , be accounted for by a non - laterally expanding jet as well as continual energy injection through refreshed shocks .",
    "we , therefore , find an early jet break before t+80  s can satisfy the conditions imposed by our observations without requiring a large energy budget and with a reasonable set of physical parameters .",
    "in this paper we have presented multi - wavelength spectral and temporal data taken with _ swift _  of grb  061007 , an very bright grb with unusually smooth panchromatic decay . using these data we explored the circumstances that could produce such a bright burst , and so determined the conditions that distinguish grb  061007 from other , more standard grbs . on many levels",
    "we find grb 061007 to be typical of other grbs , suggesting that the same progenitor model for most long grbs is also applicable to grb  061007 .",
    "the surrounding dust has properties most consistent with an lmc - like environment , and the circumburst material is likely to be dense , suggesting that it is embedded in a large molecular cloud or a region of active star formation .",
    "furthermore , its consistency with both the amati and timelag - luminosity relations , which apply to a large fraction of long grbs , indicating that the source of energy in grb  061007 is no different than that of most other long grbs .",
    "the enormous brightness of grb  061007 is , therefore , unlikely to be due to a different type of progenitor , but the result of extreme values for a few defining characteristics .",
    "two inherently different models can satisfy our observations of grb  061007 , where the main difference lies in the time of the jet break ; either before or after our observations .",
    "both require certain extreme conditions to account for the brightness of this burst , either in the form of a large energy budget or in the collimation of ejecta into a very narrow jet opening angle .",
    "however , given the brightness of grb  061007 , it should not be a surprise that some of the defining properties are non - standard .",
    "the large amount of kinetic energy required in a late - time jet break model lead us to favour a model in which the grb  061007 is produced by the concentration of energy into a highly narrow jet @xmath332 ; a condition that can more easily be met than the production of large amounts of energy .",
    "the brightness of grb  061007 across the electromagnetic spectrum makes it ideal to explore the conditions surrounding the production of grbs , and its uniqueness provides further insight into the range in properties that grbs have .",
    "the small opening angle that we determine for grb  061007 has important implications on the true range in jet opening angles , and this could provide a clue as to the cause for the large fraction of _ swift _  grbs with no clear signs of jet breaks .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the contributions of all members of the _ swift _  team .",
