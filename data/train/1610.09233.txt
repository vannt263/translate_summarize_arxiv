    "the one - electron radial functions used to construct the csfs and the expansion coefficients @xmath23 are determined variationally so as to leave the energy functional e = _ , ^n _ c _ c _ ( _ jm_j ) _ ( _ jm_j ) and additional terms for preserving the orthonormality of the radial orbitals stationary with respect to their variations .",
    "the resulting coupled radial equations are solved iteratively in the self - consistent field ( scf ) procedure .",
    "once radial functions have been determined , a configuration interaction ( ci ) calculation is performed over the set of configuration states , providing the expansion coefficients for building the potentials of the next iteration .",
    "the scf and ci coupled processes are repeated until convergence of the total wave function   and energy   is reached .",

    "the two different methods that are applied to compute these quantities are outlined in the next two subsections .",
    "the main ideas of this approach are outlined here and more details can be found in the works by shabaev @xcite and palmer @xcite , who pioneered the theory of the relativistic mass shift used in the present work .",

    "thus , the wave function @xmath40 is optimized for a specific isotope within this approach .",
    "another way to determine @xmath2 and @xmath3 , using an _ ab initio _ method , is to compute the energies of the upper and lower atomic levels for several isotopes . in this approach",
    "we diagonalize the full hamiltonian matrix including the contribution from the mass shift and the extended nuclear charge distribution  @xcite , as implemented in ratip  @xcite .    for given transition and triad of isotopes @xmath41 ,",
    "yields a @xmath42 system of equations that expresses the computed transition shifts in terms of the unknown is factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 . very much resembling the experimental procedure",
    ", the system of equations is subsequently solved to obtain the two electronic factors  @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage of providing a single set of average mass and field shift factors for a chain of isotopes , adopting the same standard parametrization as for the experimental analysis .",
    "furthermore , the reliability of can be estimated by investigating the magnitude of the variations in the calculated factors for different choices of isotope triads . for light and neutral systems like al  i ,",
    "this variation is much smaller than the uncertainty due to electron correlation .",
    "the main disadvantage of this method is , that it requires the relativistic ci ( rci ) calculations to be performed for a series of selected isotopes .",
    "we adopt this approach by first computing the wave functions for the @xmath43al isotope , that we use in subsequent rci calculations for a series of aluminium isotopes to get the transition energies and deduce the corresponding transition is . for the computations",
    ", we used the isotopes @xmath44 , that cover a wide range of the observed isotopes and the entire range targeted in the planned experiments  @xcite .",
    "the triads later used for the extraction of the factors are all ten that arise from the above mentioned choice of five isotopes .",
    "the nms factor is calculated by including a @xmath45 term in the hamiltonian , where @xmath46 is the dirac kinetic energy operator associated with electron  @xmath47  @xcite , which is an approximation of the @xmath48 operator built on the relativistic electron momenta .",
    "the sms operator that is included in the hamiltonian for the rci calculations is limited to the standard mass polarization term @xmath49 , as described in the write - up of the sms92 program  @xcite .    in order to separate the normal and specific mass shift ,",
    "different calculations have to be carried out .",
    "furthermore , by diagonalization without any mass shift contribution , the field shift factor can be determined independently .",
    "this reduces to the direct computation via @xmath50 from , if the atomic masses are kept constant . in this particular case ,",
    "the effect due to the varying nuclear mass along an isotopic chain on the field shift is neglected .",
    "however , we did not neglect it in the present calculations , even though a small deviation from the computation via @xmath51 was found .",
    "four transitions are under investigation in laser spectroscopy experiments  @xcite along the al isotopic chain , in order to determine nuclear properties of the targeted isotopes ( see ): @xmath52 ( 394.51  nm ) , @xmath53 ( 396.26  nm ) , @xmath54 ( 308.30  nm ) and @xmath55 ( 309.37  nm ) .        to effectively capture electron correlation , csfs of a particular symmetry ( @xmath20 ) and parity ( @xmath19 )",
    "are generated through excitations within an active space of orbitals , consisting of orbitals occupied in the reference configurations and correlation orbitals . from hardware and software limitations ,",
    "it is impossible to use complete active space ( cas ) wave functions that would include all csfs with appropriate @xmath20 and @xmath19 for a given orbital active space .",
    "hence the csf expansions have to be constrained ensuring that major correlation excitations are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "single ( s ) and double ( d ) substitutions are performed on a multireference ( mr ) set , which contains the csfs that have large expansion coefficients and account for the major correlation effects .",
    "these sd - mr substitutions take into account valence - valence ( vv ) , core - valence ( cv ) as well as core - core ( cc ) correlations .",
    "the vv correlation model only allows sd substitutions from valence orbitals , while the vv+cv correlation model considers srd substitutions ( single and restricted double ) from core and valence orbitals , limiting the excitations to a maximum of one hole in the core .",
    "by contrast , the vv+cv+cc correlation model allows all sd substitutions from core and valence orbitals .    within this approach ,",
    "orbital basis set is chosen for the lower and upper states of each transition .",
    "the reference states are obtained using a valence - cas procedure : sdt ( sd + triple ) substitutions are performed within the @xmath56 valence orbitals , also including the @xmath57 orbital in the active space for the transitions to the @xmath58 state ( see ) .",
    "the @xmath57 orbital is added to improve the convergence of the @xmath59 orbital in the optimisation of the energy functional .",
    "an scf procedure is then applied to the resulting csfs , providing the orbital set and the expansion coefficients . due to limited computer resources",
    ", such a valence - cas mr set would be too large for subsequent calculations when the active orbital space increases .",
    "hence , for reducing the size of the mr set , only the csfs whose squared expansion coefficients are larger than a given mr cutoff are kept , i.e. , @xmath60 . for each transition ,",
    "the @xmath61 values and the resulting mr sets are listed in , for the lower and upper states .",
    "the @xmath62 orbital is kept closed in all subsequent calculations , i.e. , no substitution from this orbital is allowed .",
    "tests show that opening the @xmath62 orbital does not affect the ms and fs factors to any notable extent .",
    "only orbitals occupied in the single configuration dhf approximation are treated as spectroscopic , i.e. , are required to have a node structure similar to the corresponding hydrogenic orbitals  @xcite .",
    "the occupied reference orbitals are frozen in all subsequent calculations .",
    "the @xmath20-levels belonging to a given term are optimised simultaneously with standard weights through the extended optimal level ( eol ) scheme  @xcite and the set of virtual orbitals is increased layer by layer .    for a given transition",
    ", the optimisation procedure is summarised as follows :    \\(1 ) perform _ simultaneous _ calculations for the lower state and the upper state of the transition , using an mr set consisting of csfs with the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 ( + @xmath57 ) and @xmath65 .",
    "optimise all orbitals simultaneously .",
    "these csfs account for a fair amount of the vv correlation .",
    "\\(2 ) keep the orbitals fixed from step 1 , and optimise an orbital basis layer by layer up to @xmath66 for both states of the transition , described by csfs with respective @xmath67 symmetries .",
    "these csfs are obtained by sd - mr substitutions with the restriction that there is at most one excitation from the @xmath68 core .",

    "following the procedure in steps 1 - 2 or 1 - 3 respectively yields results labelled ` cv ' or ` cc ' in tables  [ table_e ] and [ table_knms_ksms_kms_f ] .",
    "the cc effects are more balanced if a common orbital basis is used for describing both the upper and lower states , resulting in more accurate transition energies , as discussed in .",
    "the csf expansions become significantly large when cc correlations are taken into account , counting up to @xmath69  csfs . hence , applying an scf procedure to such number of csfs takes too much computing time .",
    "this justifies the use of the ci method at that stage .",
    "the effect of adding the breit interaction to the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian , , is found to be much smaller than the uncertainty in the transition is factors with respect to the correlation model .",

    "the convergence analysis is different concerning the @xmath55 transition . indeed , from ` vv  @xmath79 ' to `",
    "cv  @xmath76 ' , the @xmath77 value is strongly modified ( @xmath84 ) , due to a larger variation of @xmath70 for the upper level than for the lower level .",
    "this change is even stronger for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the fluctuating transition results from ` cv  @xmath87 ' to ` cv  @xmath88 ' are due to differences of values that are very close to each other for the lower and upper states , and an actual convergence is only achieved at the ` cv  @xmath76 ' stage .",
    "a look at the ms and fs factors displayed in shows that small variations in the level values due to correlation effects can lead to a significant variation in the transition values , @xmath75 .",
    "this illustrates how sensitive these electronic factors are to the active orbital space used , and hence how challenging it is to obtain reliable values with such a computational approach .",
    "this observation also holds for the other transitions studied in this work .",

    "[ sec : as ] , while the latter strategy implies separate calculations for the lower and upper states , leading to two different orbital basis sets in which orbital relaxation is allowed .",
    "hence , differences in the results of the transition is factors may arise from two different sources : ( i )  discrepancies between ris3 and ratip approaches considering a given optimisation strategy and ( ii )  discrepancies between common and separate optimisation strategies considering a given computational approach .",
    "both sources of discrepancies provide error bars on the is factors within the vv+cv model .    for both optimisation strategies , a very good consistency is found between the results of ris3 and ratip , despite the intrinsic differences in the two approaches .",
    "indeed the agreement is not expected to be perfect , since the two approaches do not involve the same operators in the computation of the is factors .",
    "relativistic corrections to the recoil hamiltonian   are part of the explanation for the small discrepancies that are observed .",
    "the major part of the error bars on the is factors arises from the discrepancies between the two optimisation strategies , whether ris3 or ratip is used .",
    "concerning the transitions to the @xmath58 state , the relative differences stay within @xmath94 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and are slightly larger for the transitions to the @xmath95 state for the reason discussed above .",

    "for @xmath77 and @xmath80 , the relative differences from ` cv  @xmath76 ' to ` cc  @xmath76 ' are respectively @xmath96 and @xmath97 , of the same order as the ones within the vv+cv model , while the difference is lower for @xmath81 ( @xmath82 against @xmath83 ) .",

    "however convergence and consistency obviously do not imply accuracy , simply because the adopted correlation model may not be adequate for the studied properties .",

    "as @xmath128 is used by experimentalists in a king plot technique as the slope of a linear fit , a small error in these @xmath92 values can induce a large error in the slope , leading to inaccurate results . with this respect",
    ", a good subject for laser spectroscopy experiments along the al isotopic chain would be the study of the @xmath129 intercombination transitions in al  i , since the fs factor is much larger for these transitions than for the other ones , due to the different occupations of the @xmath130 orbital .",
    "this work describes an _ ab initio _",
    "method for the relativistic calculation of the is electronic factors in many - electron atoms using the mcdhf approach .",
    "two computational approaches are adopted for the estimation of the ms and fs factors for transitions between low - lying states in al  i. the first one , implemented in ris3 , is based on the expectation values of the relativistic recoil hamiltonian for a given isotope , together with the field shift factors estimated from the total electron densities at the origin .",
    "the second one , implemented in ratip , consists in extracting the relevant factors from the calculated transition shifts for given triads of isotopes . in both of them ,",
    "different correlation models are explored in a systematic way to determine a reliable computational strategy and estimate theoretical error bars .",
    "results obtained with ris3 and ratip agree well with each other , since the relativistic corrections to the recoil operator , implemented differently in these two codes , are expected to be small for al  i.    within each correlation model , the convergence of the level ms factors and the electronic probability density at the origin , as a function of the increasing active space , is studied for the @xmath52 and @xmath55 transitions .",
    "it is shown that small variations in the level values due to correlation effects can lead to a significant variation in the transition values , more pronounced in the latter transition .",
    "this observation highlights the challenge in obtaining accurate is factors with such an approach .",
    "the study performed on al  i shows that cc correlations need to be accounted for in the computational strategy in order to obtain more accurate values for the transition energies .",
    "by contrast , the accuracy of the nms factors in comparison with results from the scaling law is not improved when cc effects are added , which is in contrast to a similar work performed on mg  i  @xcite .",
    "decreasing the mr cutoff further is possible in mg  i due to a smaller restricted csf space , but impossible in al  i due to computer limitations .",
    "furthermore , both works show that the sms factors are less accurate within the vv+cv+cc model , while no significant change in the fs factors is found .",
    "hence , the most reliable correlation model remains the vv+cv model .",
    "a possible way to improve the accuracy of the present results is the use of the partitioned correlation function interaction ( pcfi ) approach  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea of relaxing the orthonormality restriction on the orbital basis , and breaking down the very large calculations in the traditional multiconfiguration methods into a series of smaller parallel calculations .",
    "this method is very flexible for targeting different electron correlation effects .",
    "cc effects in is factors could be then treated more accurately and efficiently with the use of this technique .",
    "additionally , electron correlation effects beyond the sd - mr model ( such as triple and quadruple excitations ) can be included perturbatively .",
    "work is being done in these directions .",
