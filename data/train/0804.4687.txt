    "if we could map , at fixed time , the instantaneous locations in three - dimensional space of all kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) , on what two - dimensional surface would the density of kbos be greatest ?",
    "we call this surface the plane of the kuiper belt ( kbp ) , though by `` plane '' we do not mean to imply that the kbp is flat ( we shall find that it is not ) .",
    "the kbp depends on the mass distribution of the solar system  principally , the orbits and masses of the giant planets .",
    "there are as many different kbps as there are dynamical classes of kbo , since each class of object feels a distinct time - averaged force . here",

    ", theoretical determination of the kbp would help observers to discover new kbos .",
    "conversely , by measuring differences between the theoretical kbp and the actual kbp , we might hope to infer the presence of solar system bodies as yet undetected ( `` planet x '' ; see gaudi & bloom 2005 for a summary of current limits ) .",
    "there is disagreement regarding the location of the kbp .",
    "brown & pan ( 2004 ) analyzed the instantaneous proper motion vectors of hundreds of kbos irrespective of dynamical class and concluded , with greater than @xmath0 confidence , that the kbp did not coincide with the invariable plane ( ip , the plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum vector of the solar system ) .",
    "they argued that the observed kbp was consistent instead with the forced plane given by linear secular perturbation theory .",
    "we will refer to this plane as the bvwp , after brouwer & van woerkom ( 1950 ) , who developed a linear secular theory for the motions of all eight of the major planets .",
    "their theory , in turn , has its origin in the laplace - lagrange equations ( see , e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "the bvwp is a warped and time - variable surface whose properties we review in  [ review ] .",
    "by contrast , elliot et al .  ( 2005 ) found that the plane determined by classical kbos that were observed over multiple epochs was more consistent with the ip ( @xmath1 difference ) than with the bvwp ( @xmath23@xmath3 difference ) .",
    "they listed some arguments , none conclusive , for why the ip might be preferred over the bvwp .",

    "these latter two properties reflect the @xmath67 secular resonance at @xmath68au , where the denominators @xmath69 of equations ( [ eq_qforced])([eq_pforced ] ) vanish : the forced response becomes infinite in magnitude at resonance , and changes phase by @xmath70 across resonance ( the sign of @xmath69 switches across @xmath71au ) .",

    "while the free nodes distribute themselves over all phases , the free inclinations @xmath47 remain fixed .",
    "thus , at late times , the collection of free inclination vectors @xmath76 are distributed axisymmetrically about the mean forced pole at @xmath77 au .",
    "the axisymmetry arises practically independently of how the particles orbit normals are initially distributed ; the only requirements are that many particles share the same @xmath47 ( so that such particles , when phase mixed , trace a full circle ) and that there exists a small but non - zero dispersion in semi - major axis ( so that there exists a non - zero spread in free precession frequencies , enabling phase mixing ) .",
    "note in figure [ fig_phasemix ] how the invariable pole does not coincide with the center of the circular distribution .",
    "we conclude that according to the bvw theory , the mean orbit normal of a phase - mixed group of particles having approximately the same semi - major axis is given by the forced pole corresponding to that semi - major axis . that local forced pole varies with time ( figure [ fig_diameter ] ) , but the particles always encircle it ( figure [ fig_phasemix ] ) .",
    "the kbp is warped because the forced pole changes direction with kbo semi - major axis ( figure [ fig_diameter ] ) .",

    "is impossible . and",

    "in fact they are nearly so , varying by at most one part out of six .",

    "classical kuiper belt objects trace a sheet that warps and precesses in response to the planets . the current location and shape of this sheet  the `` plane '' of the classical kuiper belt  can be computed using linear secular theory , with the observed masses and current orbits of the planets as input parameters ( brown & pan 2004 ) .",
    "the local normal to the plane is given by the theory s forced inclination vector , which is specific to every semi - major axis . at infinite distance from the planets",
    ", the plane coincides with the invariable plane .",
    "the deviations of the kuiper belt plane away from the invariable plane , while generally non - zero , are typically small : less than 3 degrees outside the secularly unstable gap at @xmath158 au ( inside the gap no kbos have been observed , as expected ) . as the semi - major axis varies from @xmath159 au to @xmath160 au , the ascending node of the kuiper belt plane on the invariable plane rotates by very nearly 180 degrees , a result of the sign change in the forced response across the @xmath67 resonance .",
    "these conclusions are supported by our numerical integrations of giant planet and test particle orbits lasting 4 gyr .",
    "these integrations show that a kuiper belt object maintains a nearly fixed orbital inclination with respect to the time - variable kuiper belt plane .",
    "this accords with linear theory , in which the free inclination represents the undamped , constant amplitude of a test particle s free oscillation . it may seem surprising that the linear theory is vindicated in this regard while it can not accurately predict planetary motions and hence the future location of the kuiper belt plane .",
    "but the inaccuracies accrue only slowly  figure [ fig_ad ] shows that it takes several precession periods for the linear theory to diverge from numerical simulation in predicting the location of the plane , and the analytic and numerical solutions are always qualitatively similar . referring back to the equations of motion ( [ ddotq])([ddotp ] ) , we see that if we take the planetary forcing terms @xmath161 and @xmath162 to be given by the more realistic numerical integration  instead of the inaccurate but qualitatively similar analytic solution ( [ q_j])([p_j])then the free component of the motion ( the homogeneous solution of the differential equation ) would still be given by ( [ qfree])([pfree ] ) , irrespective of the forced component ( the inhomogenous solution ) .",
    "thus an object can keep its free inclination with respect to the forced plane fixed , even though the location of the forced plane itself can not be forecast analytically .",

    "<S> by numerically integrating the orbits of the giant planets and of test particles over a period of four billion years , we follow the evolution of the location of the midplane of the kuiper belt . </S>",
    "<S> the classical kuiper belt conforms to a warped sheet that precesses with a 1.9 myr period . </S>",
    "<S> the present - day location of the kuiper belt plane can be computed using linear secular perturbation theory : the local normal to the plane is given by the theory s forced inclination vector , which is specific to every semi - major axis . </S>",
    "<S> the kuiper belt plane does not coincide with the invariable plane , but deviates from it by up to a few degrees in stable zones . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at a semimajor axis of 38 au , the local kuiper belt plane has an inclination of 1.9 degrees and a longitude of ascending node of 149.9 degrees when referred to the mean ecliptic and equinox of j2000 . at a semimajor axis of 43 </S>",
    "<S> au , the local plane has an inclination of 1.9 degrees and a nodal longitude of 78.3 degrees . only at infinite semimajor axis </S>",
    "<S> does the kuiper belt plane merge with the invariable plane , whose inclination is 1.6 degrees and nodal longitude is 107.7 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> a classical kuiper belt object keeps its inclination relative to the kuiper belt plane nearly constant , even while the latter plane departs from the trajectory predicted by linear theory . </S>",
    "<S> the constancy of relative inclination reflects the undamped amplitude of free oscillation ; that is , the homogeneous solution to the forced harmonic oscillator equation retains constant amplitude , even while the inhomogeneous solution can not be written down accurately because the planetary forcing terms are chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> current observations of classical kuiper belt objects are consistent with the plane being warped by the giant planets alone , but the sample size will need to increase by a few times before confirmation exceeds @xmath0 in confidence . in principle , differences between the theoretically expected plane and the observed plane could be used to infer as yet unseen masses orbiting the sun , but carrying out such a program would be challenging . </S>"
