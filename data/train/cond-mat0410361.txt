    "success of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite for the ground - state calculations had prompted search @xcite for similar theories for the excited - states . over the past decade , time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite has become a standard tool @xcite for obtaining transition energies and the associated oscillator strengths .",
    "however , despite its widespread use , the theory is not without limitations .",
    "for example , calculating excitation energies for double excitation of electrons still remains @xcite a challenge in the tddft approach . at the same time , the charm of getting the excitation energy as the difference between two total energies remains .",
    "this is because one can choose the excited - state at will , promoting as many electrons as one wishes to a set of chosen orbitals , calculate the total corresponding energy and find the excitation energy by subtracting the ground - state energy .",
    "thus research in the direction of performing a kohn - sham like calculation for the excited - states continues .    a ground - state like dft approach to obtain the total energy of an excited - state has been developed by grling @xcite and by levy and nagy @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on the constrained - search approach @xcite and proposes that the energy of an excited - state can also be written as a functional @xmath0 = f[\\rho,\\rho_{0 } ] + \\int\\rho({\\bf r})v_{ext}({\\bf r})d{\\bf r } \\label{1}\\ ] ] of the excited - state density @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 $ ] is a bi - density functional that depends on the ground - state density @xmath3 also , and @xmath4 is the external potential that the electrons are moving in .",
    "the bi - density functional for the density @xmath5 of the @xmath6 excited - state is defined via the constrained - search formulation as @xmath7 = { \\rm min}_{\\psi \\to \\rho } \\left < \\psi | { \\hat t } + { \\hat v}_{ee}|\\psi \\right > \\ ; , \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is orthogonal to the lower @xmath9 states of the hamiltonian , already determined by the density @xmath3 . such a way of obtaining the functional @xmath2 $ ] makes it non - universal and also state - dependent .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy functional @xmath10 $ ] for the excited - state is then defined as the difference of @xmath2 $ ] and the non - interacting kinetic energy @xmath11 $ ] corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "the latter is defined in a manner similar to eq .  [ 2 ] by dropping the operator @xmath12 from the right hand side .",
    "thus ( for brevity , from here onwards we drop @xmath3 from the argument of the functional ) @xmath13 = f[\\rho]-t_{s}[\\rho]\\;. \\label{3}\\ ] ] with the assumption that the excited - state density is non - interacting v - representable , the density is obtained by solving the excited - states kohn - sham equation ( atomic units are used throughout the paper ) @xmath14\\phi_{i}({\\bf",
    "r})= \\epsilon_{i}\\phi_{i } ( { \\bf r } ) \\label{4}\\ ] ] as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the occupation number of the orbital @xmath17 . in eq .",
    "[ 4 ] the various terms have their standard meaning with @xmath18 representing the exchange - correlation potential for the excited - state .",
    "it is determined by taking the functional derivative of the excited - state exchange - correlation energy functional . that a kohn - sham like calculation can be performed for the excited - states",
    "was first proposed by harbola and sahni @xcite on physical grounds , and has been put @xcite on a rigorous mathematical footing recently on the basis of differential virial theorem @xcite .",
    "calculations of excited - states energies based on the harbola - sahni work have yielded excellent results @xcite .",
    "the near exact exchange - correlation potential for the singlet @xmath19 excited - state of helium has also been constructed @xcite recently .",
    "however , we are not aware of any work where an exchange - correlation functional for the excited - states has been reported ; in performing excited - state calculations @xcite , either the ground - state functionals or the orbital based - theories @xcite have been employed .",
    "the proposition for the construction of an excited - state exchange - correlation functional is indeed a difficult one since the functional is non - universal and also state - dependent .",
    "thus a general functional form for it may not exist .",
    "against such a background , we ask if it is at all possible to obtain a simple lda - like functional for the excited - states . to keep matters simple",
    ", we have been looking at this problem within the exchange - only approximation . in this paper",
    "we show that it is indeed possible to construct an exchange energy functional that gives transition energies comparable to the exact exchange - only theories such as hartree - fock @xcite , optimized potential @xcite or the harbola - sahni @xcite theory .",
    "the construction of the functional is based on the homogeneous electron - gas and in finding the final form of the functional we are guided mostly by qualitative plausibility arguments .",
    "our work is thus exploratory in nature and represents probably the first attempt to construct an excited - state exchange - energy functional in terms of the density .",
    "the evidence of the accuracy of the functional constructed by us is given by the results of the transition energies of a large number of excited - states .",
    "we also refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for an expression for the change in the exchange energy in terms of the ground - state kohn - sham orbitals when an electron is promoted from a lower energy orbital to a higher one .    in the present work",
    "we take a particular class of excited states in which some core orbital are filled , then there are some vacant orbitals and again there are some filled orbitals .",
    "we construct an lda - like functional for such states in the following section .",
    "as stated above , we now consider such excited - states where the occupation of the orbitals is such that the electrons occupy some core orbitals and some shell orbitals , leaving the orbitals between the core and the shell region vacant .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ f : co - she ] .",
    "such an excited - state would be obtained , for example , if an electron from the filled orbitals of the ground - state is excited to just above the occupied levels .",
    "the exact exchange energy for a set of occupied orbitals is given as @xmath20 so that the excited - state exchange energy when an electron is transferred from one of the orbitals occupied in the ground - state to the lowest unoccupied level is given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the orbital from which the electron has been removed and @xmath23 where the electron is added .",
    "the sum over the index @xmath24 in the second term on the right hand side runs over all the orbitals , including @xmath22 and @xmath23 , up to the highest occupied orbital in the excited - state . on the other hand",
    "the sum in the fifth term runs over all the orbital except @xmath23 .",
    "we now attempt to make an lda - like approximation for the excited - state exchange energy so that the difference ( the last four terms in the equation above ) between the approximate excited- and ground - state exchange energies is close to that given by the exact expression above . in making this approximation accurate ,",
    "it is evident that the self - energy terms ( third and fourth terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ 7 ] ) for the orbitals @xmath22 and @xmath23 are to be treated accurately .    as the first step towards an excited - state functional , we make the correspondence between the excited - states that we are considering and similar excitations in a homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) .",
    "if the heg is in it s ground state , the electrons are filled up to the fermi level so that the electrons occupy wave - vectors in k - space from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , where @xmath5 is the electron density . on the other hand ,",
    "in an excited state of the system the electrons will occupy k - space differently compared to the ground state .",
    "for the kind of excited - states that we consider in this paper , the corresponding occupation in the k - space is as follows : the electrons occupy orbitals from @xmath25 to @xmath27 and @xmath28 to @xmath29 with a gap in between as shown in fig .",
    "( [ k - space ] ) .",
    "space occupation in the ground and the excited state configuration . ]    so that the excited state density is given by @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 in eq .",
    "[ 8 ] @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the core ( corresponding to the electrons occupying @xmath36space from zero to @xmath27 ) and the shell ( corresponding to the electrons occupying @xmath36space from @xmath28 to @xmath29 ) density , respectively , and @xmath5 is the total density .    the exchange energy for the heg that occupies the k - space as described above can be obtained exactly and is given as ( mlda stands for modified local density approximation ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 \\label{13}\\ ] ] is the exchange energy of the core electrons , @xmath39 \\label{14}\\ ] ] is the exchange energy of the electrons in the shell , and @xmath40 \\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\left(k_3 ^ 2 - k_1 ^ 2)^2 \\ln \\left(\\frac{k_3 + k_1}{k_3 - k_1 } \\right ) \\right ] \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] represents the exchange energy of interaction between the core and the shell electrons . here",
    "@xmath41 is the volume of the heg . after adding the three terms",
    ", the exchange - energy can also be written in the form @xmath42d{\\bf r } + log\\ ; terms \\label{16}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 represents the exchange - energy per particle when the heg is in its ground - state with the fermi momentum equal to @xmath44 .",
    "the equation above has a nice interpretation : the integral on the right - hand side represents the exchange energy of the system of electrons with density @xmath5 when per electron energy is written as @xmath45 $ ] , i.e. the per electron energy is given according to the occupation in the k - space ( compare with eq .  [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the log terms , on the other hand , have no such simple interpretation .",
    "they have the kinetic energy density in them but we have not been able to write the terms in as easy a form as the first term . that the functional above has all the right limits if we take @xmath46 or @xmath47 is easily verified .",
    "finally , the modified local spin density ( lsd ) functional @xmath48 $ ] in terms of the spin densities @xmath49 and @xmath50 is easily obtained from the functional above as @xmath51 = \\frac{1}{2}e_{x}^{mlda } [ 2\\rho^{\\alpha } ] + \\frac{1}{2}e_{x}^{mlda}[2\\rho^{\\beta } ]   \\label{lsda}\\ ] ]    having derived the exchange functional for the heg , we now apply it to the excited - states of various atoms to check if the functional above gives exchange energy differences accurately .",
    "the excited - states chosen are such that they can be represented by a single slater determinant so that the lda is a good approximation @xcite for them .",
    "the different radii in the k - space , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , needed to evaluate the exchange energy are found by eqs .",
    "[ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and [ 10 ] . for each state",
    "( ground and excited ) , the same set of orbitals @xcite is employed to get the hartree - fock and the lsd exchange energies .",
    "we calculate the lsd and mlsd exchange energies using spherical spin densities since the effect of non - sphericity on the total exchange energy is small @xcite .    in table",
    "i we show the difference between the excited - state exchange energy and the ground - state exchange energy for some atoms and ions . in the first column",
    "we give the difference as obtained by the hartree - fock expression for the exchange energy .",
    "in the second coulumn , the numbers are given for both the excited - state and the ground - state exchange energies obtained by employing the ground - state lsd functional .",
    "the third column gives the energy difference when the excited - state exchange energy is calculated using the functional of eq .",
    "it is clearly seen that the ground - state lsd approximation underestimates this energy difference .",
    "this is not surprising since the ground - state functional would give a larger exchange energy for the excited - state than what a proper excited - state functional should give .",
    "however , when the functional of eq .",
    "[ 12 ] is employed to calculate the exchange energy for the excited - states we find , to our surprise , that for the majority of the atoms the functional overestimates the differences by a large amount , whereas we expected to find the error to be about @xmath52 which is the general lda exchange energy error .",
    "we note that this large difference can not come because we have spherical densities .",
    "if non - spherical densities are used , the difference may increase even further .",
    "for example , for the fluorine atom , the ground - state exchange energy will become more negative for non - spherical densities . on the other hand ,",
    "the excited - state exchange energy will remain unchanged since the density is already spherical .",
    "this will result in an even larger difference in the exchange energies of the two states .",
    "we now look for possible sources of error in the exchange - energy differences when the functional of eq .",
    "[ 12 ] is employed to get the exchange energy for the excited - states .",
    "for this we examine eq .  [",
    "7 ] in which the last four terms on the right hand side represent the exchange energy difference .",
    "thus @xmath53 it is the lda values to this term that are given in table i. the sources of error in this term we suspect are the self - exchange energies of the orbitals @xmath22 and @xmath23 involved in the electron transfer .",
    "we now argue that the self - energy correction for both the terms sould be in the same direction .",
    "thus for both the orbitals the self - interaction correction ( sic ) is made by subtracting @xcite @xmath54 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int\\int\\frac{|\\phi({\\bf r}_{1})|^{2 }     |\\phi({\\bf r}_{2})|^{2})}{|{\\bf r}_{1}-{\\bf r}_{2}|}d{\\bf r}_{1}d{\\bf r}_{2 }     - e_{x}^{lsd}[\\rho(\\phi)]\\ ; , \\label{18}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the orbital density for the orbital @xmath56 .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "the lda should be reasonablty accurate when the integral over @xmath44 is continuous .",
    "this makes the first term in the energy difference accurate .",
    "we do have a choice of writing the first and the second terms as @xmath57 but then the first term above will not be accurate as the lda to it would involve integration in k - space with a break from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . therefore to keep the lda accurate , we keep the summation continuous and write the self - interaction energy of the electron removed with a negative sign in front . by including the self - interaction correction for the removed electron only , we find that the error in the exchange energy difference reduces to about @xmath52 of the corresponding hf value . to make the difference even more acuurate",
    ", we now consider the term for the orbital @xmath23 where the electron is added . there",
    "the electron comes in with its self - interaction so for the added orbital too @xmath58 should be subtracted to make the results for the energy difference comparable to the hartree - fock results .",
    "thus the final expression for the exchange - energy that we have is @xmath59-e_{x}^{sic}[\\phi_{add } ] \\label{20}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the energy functional given by eq .",
    "[ 12 ] and @xmath61 $ ] is given by eq .  [ 18 ] .",
    "we now compute the exchange energy differences given by the functional in eq .  [",
    "20 ] and show them in table i. as is evident from the numbers displayed there , the functional of eq .",
    "[ 20 ] gives highly accurate exchange - energy differences for all the systems considered .",
    "when the exchnage - energy difference between the ground- and the excited - state is small , the hf , lsd and the functionals derived above , all give roughly the same results .",
    "however , when this difference is large , the lda underestimates the magnitude of the difference by a large amount whereas the functional of eq .",
    "q:[12 ] overestimates it .",
    "only when the latter is corrected for the self - interaction is the difference almost the same as the hartree - fock difference .    having obtained the functional to obtain accurate exchange energy difference , we now apply it to a large number of excited - states of the class considered here and find that we get the transition energies very close to those given by the hartree - fock theory .",
    "we now employ the exchange functional @xmath62 proposed above to obtain the transition energies for a variety of excitations in different atoms . we find that for all the systems the transition energies obtained by us are very close to the corresponding hartree - fock energies @xcite .",
    "our calculations proceed as follows : we get the ground - state energy by solving the kohn - sham equation with the effective exchange potential calculated using the dirac formula @xcite .",
    "we then solve the kohn - sham equation with the same ( corresponding to the ground - state ) functional for the excited - state configuration .",
    "this gives us the excited - state energy @xmath63 .",
    "the difference between @xmath63 and the ground - state energy gives us the transition energy @xmath64 .",
    "we then employ the kohn - sham orbitals from this calculation to get the modified lda exchange energy including sic by employing the functional @xmath62 of eq .",
    "[ 19 ] . making appropriate corrections",
    "we then get the total excited - state energy corresponding to this functional , and its difference with the ground - state energy gives us @xmath65 .",
    "although we have not performed self - consistent calculations with the new functional , self - consistency is not expected to affect the results significantly .",
    "this is because , as we shall see in the results , the major difference in the transition energies given by different functionals arises from the difference in the value of the exchange energy itself .",
    "shown in table ii are the transition energies @xmath66 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for some light atoms and ions when one of their inner electrons is excited to the lowest available orbital .",
    "the excitation energy in these systems is such that for some of them @xmath64 is close to @xmath66 but for others it is not .",
    "however , @xmath65 is uniformly accurate for all the systems .",
    "we note that the error in @xmath64 is almost fully from the error in the corresponding exchange energy difference .",
    "this is evident from a comparison of the numbers in table i ( for the exchange energy differences ) and in table ii .    in table iii",
    "we look at the excitation energies of the alkali atoms and @xmath67 by exciting an electron from the uppermost orbital to an outer orbital .",
    "these are weakly bound systems and as such their excitation energies are relatively smaller .",
    "thus they provide a good testing ground for the proposed functional . an interesting point about these systems",
    "is that the lsd itself gives excitation energies close to the hf excitation energies .",
    "it is therefore quite gratifying to see that the transition energies obtained by the new functional also are of very good quality , although the present method tends to slightly overestimate the transition energies .",
    "next we consider some bigger atoms where we can excite the electron from more than one inner orbital . shown in tables iv and",
    "v are the excitation energies for the atoms in the third row of the periodic table . in table",
    "iv we consider an electron being excited from the @xmath68 orbital to the @xmath69 orbital . in all these case @xmath64 is smaller than the true energy difference whereas the present functional gives highly accurate estimates of the transition energy .",
    "notice again that the error in the value of @xmath64 arises mainly from the error in the exchange energy .    in table",
    "v , we show the transition energies for the same set of atoms and ions as in table iv , but for the electron now being excited from the @xmath70 orbital to the @xmath69 orbital . consequently the energy of excitation is much larger in this case .",
    "the lsd in all these cases underestimates the excitation energy , whereas the present functional gives accurate results although slightly overestimating them .",
    "however , the error with respect to the lsd is reduced by a factor of @xmath71 or more .    shown in table vi",
    "are the excitation energies for a group of atoms for which the lsd gives transition energies very close to the hf excitation energies . in all the cases we find that the functional proposed here is able to give accurate excitation energies .",
    "thus we find that when the lsd results are accurate , so are the results given by the new functional .",
    "what is significant , however , is that when the lsd results are poor , the new functional properly corrects the error in lsd .",
    "finally , we consider the cases where two electrons are excited to the higher orbitals . as already pointed out , double excitations are difficult to deal with in the tddft approach to finding excitation energies . results for different excitations for a variety of atomic systems are shown in table vii .",
    "as is evident from the table , for all the systems , our method gives excellent results whereas the lsd underestimates the energies .",
    "in the above we have presented a new lda - like functional for obtaining the excitation energies .",
    "it has been employed to investigate over @xmath72 excited states .",
    "the results show that our procedure gives accurate excitation energies for all of them , whereas for most of the systems the lsd underestimates the energy difference .",
    "we have worked within the exchange - only approximation and have chosen a particular class of excited - states .",
    "what we have learnt through the study reported here is that a simple extension of the lda to the excited - states overestimates the energy differences .",
    "this is due to the self - interaction of the electron inherent in the lda . when corrected for the self - interaction through a careful analysis , the resulting functional gives highly accurate answers for the excited - states",
    ". thus if more accurate functionals than the lda are employed , our method of developing excited - state functionals should give good excited - state functionals .",
    "in the present work , we have developed a functional for a particular class of excited states and demonstrated that it is possible to construct excited - state energy functionals that are capable of giving transition energies close to the exact theory .",
    "we are now working on functionals for states other than considered in this paper .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , excited - state functionals are not universal and therefore have to be dealt with separately for different kinds of excited - states .    in this work",
    ", we have also not looked at the correlation energy functionals .",
    "can correlation energy functionals be developed along similar lines ?",
    "we trust that it should be possible and are working on this problem .    finally , we also wish to look at the ultimate excitation i.e. the ionization of the system . if the electron is removed from the uppermost orbital , the lda is known to give good ionization energies when calculated through the total energy difference . in these cases",
    "too our functional would give results the same as those obtained from the lda : if we go through the arguments presented earlier , we find that in these cases our functional reduces to the lda functional for the core electrons .",
    "this is because in calculating the exchnage energy , the summation over the occupied orbitals is continuous and therefore we do not have to make any self - interaction correction for the removed electron .",
    "further the shell electron density vanishes so the contribution from the added electron is zero .",
    "interestingly , we find that if we ionize the atom by removing an electron from the inner orbitals , we obtain accurate removal energies if we think of the process in two spteps - first removing an electron from the top level and then exciting the resulting ion by exciting an electron from the inner orbital to the top of filled orbitals .",
    "more work on such different kinds of excitation is in progress and will be reported in the future .",
