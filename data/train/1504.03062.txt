    "in recent years various types of inhomogeneous cosmological solutions to the einstein equations coupled with other fields have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "such exact solutions are important for studying the structure and properties of horizons , because knowledge of the global structure of the spacetime is essential for such a study .    on the other hand , time dependent solutions to the einstein equations coupled to matter fields have been investigated as models of gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "a convenient model may involve a scalar field as a matter field , which is coupled to einstein gravity .",
    "the gravitation theory including scalar fields is preferred not only because of its simplicity , but also because it can be considered as a reduced system of supergravity theory @xcite or superstring theory @xcite .",
    "exact solutions to the coupled einstein massless scalar field equations have been obtained for some simple cases , including a static case @xcite . besides a homogeneous cosmological solution ,",
    "only a few time - dependent exact solutions describing an inhomogeneous spatial metric are known .",
    "the first example of such a solution has been given by roberts @xcite .",
    "another type of exact solution has recently been given by husain , martinez and nez @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will obtain the time - dependent spherically symmetric exact solution to the einstein scalar theory in _",
    "arbitrary _ spacetime dimensions .",
    "this type of solution is a generalization of the one found by husain , martinez and nez @xcite .",
    "we will consider the metric in kaluza - klein pararmetrization @xcite , which represents topologically a product space of a @xmath2-dimensional space and a @xmath1-dimensional flat space .",
    "the configuration of the scalar field and the metric is assumed to be spherical in the @xmath0 dimensional subspace .    as well as the massless case , in this paper we consider the case with a potential term represented by an exponential function of the scalar field variable .",
    "such a potential often arises from effective field theories of string theory or supergravity theory . in these theories the scalar field",
    "is known as a dilaton field @xcite .",
    "the exponential potential plays a crucial role in the exact multi - centred solution @xcite as well as in exact solutions for cosmological inflation @xcite .",
    "one motivation for studying the time dependent solutions to the coupled einstein scalar system is that they may be regarded as an analytic model for gravitational collapse induced by scalar fields .",
    "recently there has been much progress in the numerical study of gravitational collapse .",
    "numerical results illustrate that the behaviour of a scalar field configuration may have a certain self - similarity and the critical mass of the resulting black hole may take a form governed by a certain power law with a universal critical exponent @xcite .",
    "several authors have made efforts to understand the critical phenomena qualitatively by using the exact solutions .",
    "brady @xcite and oshiro et al @xcite have discussed the critcal exponent , based on he exact solution given by roberts @xcite , while husain et al based their discussion on the exact solution derived by themselves @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider the action , including a dilaton field @xmath3 , of the form : @xmath4+\\mbox{boundary terms } \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , and the newton constant is set to unity . here",
    "we assume that the dilaton coupling @xmath6 may take an arbitrary positive value : for effective field theories of string theory it takes @xmath7 . for @xmath8 , @xmath9 simply becomes a cosmological constant .    in the following section we first consider the @xmath10 case , where the dilaton field @xmath3 is a free massless field .",
    "we will treat the case with @xmath11 in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the structure of singularities and apparent horizons in the spacetime described by the exact solutions obtained in sections 2 and 3 . in section 5",
    "we evaluate the mass for the self - gravitating system described by exact solutions with the massless scalar field obtained in section 2 .",
    "for @xmath10 the field equations derived from the action ( [ 1.1 ] ) take the following form : @xmath12 @xmath13    we wish to find the time - dependent solution to the equations ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) which can be interpreted as a product of an @xmath0-dimensional spherically symmetric space and a @xmath1-dimensional flat space .",
    "we assume that the metric should take a block diagonal form in @xmath1- and @xmath0-dimensional spaces . throughout this paper",
    "we use the following metric ; @xmath14 + \\sigma^{2/(n-2)}(r)\\,s^2(t)\\left[\\frac{dr^2}{\\delta(r)}+r^2 d\\omega^2_{n-1}\\right ] \\label{2.3}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 represents the line element of a unit ( @xmath17)-sphere . here the scale factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 are assumed to be functions of @xmath20 , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are functions of @xmath23 .",
    "now we can transform the equations ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.2 ] ) into simultaneous differential equations concerning the unknown functions @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath3 , by taking the metric ansatz ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we require the separation of equations with the variables @xmath20 and @xmath23 to obtain analytic solutions . to this end",
    "we will take another ansatz for the scalar field : the time derivative of @xmath3 depends only on @xmath20 , while the @xmath23-derivative of @xmath3 depends only on @xmath23 .",
    "we also note that the equations for the scale factors should coincide with those known in the kaluza - klein cosmological scenario @xcite .",
    "consequently , the reduced equations we obtain are divided into three groups .",
    "one group includes the equations for the temporal evolution of @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where a dot denotes derivation with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "another group includes the equations for the spatial configuration of @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30\\nonumber \\\\ & & = -\\frac{4}{d-2}(\\phi')^2 \\label{2.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath31 @xmath32+\\frac{1}{n-2}\\left [ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma'}{\\sigma}\\right)'+\\left(\\frac{\\delta'}{\\delta}+ \\frac{n-1}{r } \\right)\\frac{\\sigma'}{\\sigma}\\right]=0 \\label{2.12}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes derivation with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "the third group contains one equation , which involves both the time derivative and the radial derivative of the field variables : @xmath33    this equation ( [ 2.13 ] ) comes from the ( @xmath34)-component of the einstein equations .",

    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 is an integration constant , and the constant @xmath39 can take any value in the range @xmath40 , as long as only the equations ( [ 2.8][2.12 ] ) are taken into consideration .",
    "on the other hand , the equations for the scale factors can be solved by assuming a power law behaviour of the scale factors such as @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants .",
    "furthermore , if we take the time derivative of the scalar field as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant , then the equations ( [ 2.4][2.7 ] ) yield the following relations among @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 @xmath47    apparently , these relations are a generalization of the kasner condition in higher dimensions .    finally , the equation ( [ 2.13 ] ) gives a relation among @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath39 and @xmath45 .",
    "we find @xmath45 can be solved in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath39 and obtain @xmath48 where the sign in the right - hand side matches that in equation ( [ 2.16 ] ) .",
    "the scalar field configuration can be expressed , for instance , as @xmath49 \\label{2.22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are integration constants .",
    "since there are three equations ( [ 2.19 ] ) , ( [ 2.20 ] ) and ( [ 2.21 ] ) , there is only one degree of freedom in choosing the values of the constants . for a given value for a constant , say @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , the values of the other constants are given by roots of quadratic equations in general .",

    "@xmath52 ( @xmath54 ) . in this case",
    "the metric does not include the extra scale factor ( @xmath19 ) ; therefore the values for the constants @xmath42 , @xmath39 and @xmath45 , which appear in general cases , are fixed as : @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 where the sign in equation ( [ 2.25 ] ) is independent of the sign in ( [ 2.24 ] ) .",

    "now we turn to the @xmath11 case .",
    "the field equations then take die following form : @xmath68 @xmath69    we use the same anstze for the metric and the dilaton scalar field as in the previous section . to obtain analytic solutions",
    "we assume that the equations ( [ 2.8][2.13 ] ) are unchanged even if there is a potential term .",
    "this assumption with the homogeneous cosmological solution @xcite .",
    "we find that the assumption requires two constraints on the field variables as follows : @xmath70    the differential equations including the scale factor , which correspond to ( [ 2.4][2.7 ] ) , are reduced to : @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 the equation ( [ 2.14 ] ) becomes @xmath74    the differential equations ( [ 2.8][2.13 ] ) remain vaild in this case .",
    "thus they again call for the functions of @xmath23 as @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath39 is left undetemined in this step .",
