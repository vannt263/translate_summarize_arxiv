    "indeed , the relative variation of the diffusivity stays below 3 % in the three situation considered above .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the contact line in a microchannel is mainly ruled by the micro - structure density @xmath33 and their aspect ratio @xmath11 . in details , we observe that the change in the geometry of the pillars from cylindrical to square section reduces the dynamics of the liquid impregnation .",
    "the presence of defects in a square lattice of cylindric micropillars enhances slightly the fluid wicking .",
    "finally , a random distribution of cylindric micropillars is a bit more efficient relatively to a square arrangement . obviously , a systematic study as a function of the lattice parameters has to be lead in order to conclude on the precise impact of square section pillars , presence of defect or random distribution of pillars .",
    "we propose in this section to discuss the limitation of the model developed in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "this latter is based on a basic assumption of the fluid velocity profile in - between pillars .",
    "this velocity profile is clearly non - physical because it does not respect the non - slipping conditions of the fluid velocity along walls . in order to solve exactly the problem of the fluid flow inside a confined micropillars array , the stokes equation has to be solved with the corresponding boundary conditions and",
    "thus the resulting viscous force can be deduced .",
    "we expect our model to be close from the exact solution in the case of low pillar densities but to be less accurate for large pillar densities where the confinement modifies the fluid flow far from the assumed profile .",
    "such an effect may explain the discrepancy between experiments and theoretical predictions observed for large pillar densities in fig .",
    "[ fig : permeability_ratio]b .    also , we assumed in section [ sec : model_pillars ] that the fluid flow adopts everywhere a fully developed velocity profile .",

    "is justified .",
    "the presence of a top wall modifies the liquid impregnation behavior compared to the case of an open micropillar array .",
    "such a wall introduces two counteracting ingredients on the capillary flow : an additional surface to wet and another no - slip boundary condition . following the same procedure as in section [ sec : model_pillars ] with a free boundary condition at the top",
    ", we deduce a theoretical prediction for the diffusivity @xmath103 in the case of an open microchannel .",
