    "most liquids , when cooled to low temperatures in such a fashion that the equilibrium crystal phase does not form , undergo a lower temperature transformation to a solid phase which is _ amorphous _ , i.e. , lacking the long range periodic structure that characterizes crystalline solids .",
    "the amorphous phase is a _ glass _ , and the transformation process is referred to as the glass transition . in the process of cooling towards the glassy state , liquids display a rapid increase in viscosity , and display other unusual dynamical features such as stretched exponential relaxation and heterogeneous dynamics@xcite .",
    "the glass transition observed in experiments ( the `` laboratory glass transition '' ) is understood to be not a transition in the thermodynamic sense but a falling out of equilibrium of the liquid . whether a thermodynamic transition underlies",
    "the laboratory transition , and how an explanation of such a thermodynamic transition is linked ( or not ) to a detailed understanding of the unusual dynamics displayed by liquids at low temperatures , is a topic is considerable current research@xcite . a particular approach that has been studied , based on the analysis of local minima of the liquid s potential energy (",
    "termed `` inherent structures'')@xcite is described here .",
    "section [ secinh ] outlines the approach based the study of inherent structures .",
    "section [ secsim ] describes the details of computer simulations of a model liquid employed in implementing the analysis of some properties of glass forming liquids , along with the results .",
    "section [ secconc ] contains a summary of the results and conclusions .",
    "the disordered structure of a liquid has the implication that the energies of interaction between particles will generally be very complicated , and that the part of configuration space explored by the material in the liquid state is characterized by the presence of many local minima of the potential energy .",
    "such is the case also , _",
    "e. g. _ , in a crystalline solid if one allows for the presence of defects .",
    "the use of the phrase `` energy landscape '' to describe the complicated interactions in a glass forming liquid ( and other disordered systems ) therefore contains in addition the expectation that the complicated potential energy topogrphy plays an essential role in determining the properties of the system . if such is the case , it is desirable to attempt a description of glass forming liquids in terms of quantities that define the nature of the potential energy landscape . in the inherent structure approach ,",
    "one considers the decomposition of the @xmath0 dimensional ( for an atomic liquid ) configuration space of the liquid into basins of individual local potential energy minima .",
    "a basin of a given minimum is defined as the set of points in the configuration space ( or configurations ) which map to that minimum under a local energy minimization .",
    "the canonical partition function of the liquid can then be expressed as a sum over inherent structure basins , the summand being partial partition functions defined for individual basins . in the following ,",
    "the equations are written for a two - component atomic liquid , since the model liquid described in the next section is such a liquid . in turn , the sum over basins is written in terms of ( a ) a distribution of minima in energy , and ( b ) the free energies of basins , as follows : @xmath1\\\\          = \\sum_\\alpha exp\\left[-\\beta \\phi_\\alpha\\right ] \\lambda^{-3n } \\int_{v_\\alpha } d{\\bf r}^n exp\\left(-\\beta(\\phi-\\phi_\\alpha)\\right)\\nonumber \\\\          = \\int d\\phi ~",
    "\\omega(\\phi ) ~exp\\left[-\\beta(\\phi + f_{vib}(\\phi , t))\\right]\\nonumber \\\\",
    "= \\int d\\phi ~exp\\left[-\\beta ( \\phi + f_{vib}(\\phi , t ) - t { \\cal s}_c(\\phi))\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the total potential energy of the system , @xmath3 indexes individual inherent structures , @xmath4 is the potential energy at the minimum , @xmath5 is the number density of inherent structures with energy @xmath2 , and the configurational entropy density @xmath6 . the _ basin free energy _",
    "@xmath7 is obtained by a restricted partition function sum over a given inherent structure basin , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the de broglie wavelength , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the number of @xmath12 and @xmath13 type atoms in the two component liquid , @xmath14 is the temperature , and @xmath15 the density of the liquid . in the following ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath15 is not explicitly stated always since the interest is in @xmath14 dependent behavior at constant density .",
    "the configurational entropy of the liquid arises from the multiplicity of local potential energy minima sampled by the liquid at temperature @xmath14 , and is related to the configurational entropy density above by @xmath16 where @xmath17/q(n,\\rho , t),\\\\        = exp\\left[-\\beta ( \\phi + f_{vib}(\\phi , t ) - t { \\cal s}_c(\\phi))\\right]/q(n,\\rho , t ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the probability density that inherent structures of energy @xmath2 are sampled at temperature @xmath14 . in the above expression for the partition function , an assumption has been made that the basin free energy does not differ for different basins of the same inherent structure energy . without reference to the distribution of minima",
    ", the configurational entropy can be defined as the difference of the total entropy of the liquid and the vibrational entropy of typical minima sampled at a given temperature : @xmath18    the `` entropy theory '' of gibbs , di marzio and adam@xcite define the ideal glass transition , underlying the laboratory transition , as an `` entropy vanishing '' transition where the configurational entropy vanishes ( the configurational entropy is not , however , defined in precisely the same way in @xcite ) .",
    "a similar picture also emerges from the study of mean field spin glass models and calculations motivated by them@xcite .",
    "whether such a transition exists for real materials is still a matter of debate@xcite .",
    "the calculations below produce such an entropy vanishing transition but it must be kept in mind that they result from extrapolations which may not be valid .",
    "further , adam and gibbs@xcite theory relates the configurational entropy to relaxation times in the liquid : @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a material specific constant .",
    "the validity of this relation has been verified by numerous experimental studies ( which typically use the _ excess _ entropy of the liquid over the crystal in place of @xmath20 ) and computer simulation studies@xcite ( where configurational entropy is evaluated ) .",
    "further , if @xmath20 has the form @xmath21 , the adam - gibbs relation results in the vogel - fulcher - tammann - hesse ( vft ) form , observed to describe the @xmath14 dependence of viscosity , as well as diffusivity and relaxation times , in many glass formers .",
    "the vft relation may be written as @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the temperature of apparent divergence of viscosity .",
    "@xmath24 is a material specific parameter quantifying the _",
    "kinetic _ fragility .",
    "fragility is a measure of how rapidly the viscosity , relaxation times , _ etc _ of a liquid changes as the glassy state is approached@xcite .    that the basin free energy @xmath25 arises from `` vibrational '' motion within individual basins",
    "is emphasized by the suffix _",
    "vib_. if this motion is sufficiently localized around the minima , a suitable procedure would be to approximate the basins as harmonic wells , and to evaluate the basin free energy within this approximation .",
    "the validity of such a procedure has been tested recently in various studies@xcite .",
    "it is found that below the temperature where the liquid begins to exhibit aspects of _ slow dynamics _ , ( non - arrhenius behaviour of relaxation times , and stretched exponential relaxation)@xcite",
    ", a harmonic approximation of the basins is reasonable .",
    "additional evidence is provided in this paper concerning the validity of this approximation , as well as a classical ( as opposed to quantum mechanical ) treatment of the basin partition function .",
    "a classical calculation of the basin free energy yields @xmath26 or equivalently , the basin entropy , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the vibrational frequencies of the given basin , and @xmath29 is plank s constant . from the form of @xmath30",
    "it is apparent that the entropy difference between two basins arises solely due to the difference in their frequencies .",
    "thus , such entropy differences remain finite as @xmath31 which is unphysical as the basin entropy of each basin and therefore their difference must go to zero for @xmath32 . the extent to which this artifact affects the applicability of classical calculations employed in many recent studies depends on the deviation of the quantum mechanical result at the glass transition temperature ( since below the glass transition",
    ", the system occupies a single basin ) .",
    "the quantum mechanical basin free energy is given , in terms of the same vibrational frequencies @xmath28 , as@xcite @xmath33,\\ ] ] and the basin entropy as @xmath34 - \\sum_{i = 1}^{3n } \\ln \\left[\\exp\\left({h \\nu_i \\over 2 k_b t}\\right ) - \\exp\\left({-h \\nu_i \\over 2 k_b t}\\right)\\right].\\ ] ] a comparison will be made in the next section of these two ( eq.([eq : sbdef ] ) and eq.([eq : sbdefq ] ) ) expressions for @xmath30 .",
    "calculations based on eq.([eq : sbdef ] ) , where the vibrational frequencies are obtained numerically for energy minima generated in simulations , indicate@xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the difference in @xmath30 , between basins is roughly linear in the basin energy . thus one can write @xmath35 and correspondingly , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a reference basin energy .",
    "the latter expression follows since the internal energy @xmath38 for all basins .",
    "in addition to the basin free energy , the partition function in eq.([eq : pfn ] ) requires knowledge of the configurational entropy density @xmath39 .",
    "various recent studies have explored methods for estimating @xmath39 from computer simulations@xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the distribution @xmath5 is well described by a gaussian@xcite ( equivalently , @xmath40 an inverted parabola ) .",
    "although the arguments@xcite may not apply to low energy minima , a gaussian form for @xmath5 allows for a straightforward evaluation of the partition function eq.([eq : pfn ] ) , and whose validity has been tested in the range of temperatures where simulations are performed@xcite . the configurational entropy density is written as @xmath41 where @xmath3 is the height of the parabola and determines the total number of configurational states , _",
    "i. e. _ energy minima ( the total number is proportional to @xmath42 ) , @xmath37 and @xmath43 respectively define the mean and the variance of the distribution .",
    "the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath37 and @xmath44 have been estimated from simulation data@xcite . with the above form for @xmath45 and eq.([eq : fvib ] ) for the vibrational free energy , the partition function can be evaluated , from which the following temperature dependence of the configurational entropy , the ideal glass transition temperature @xmath46 ( defined by @xmath47 and the inherent structure energies are obtained : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 these equations constitute relations that express quantities relevant to the thermodynamics of glass forming liquids , the configurational entropy and the ideal glass transition temperature , in terms of paramters that describe the `` energy landscape '' of the liquid , namely the distribution of local energy minima , and the topography of individual minima in the form of vibrational frequencies .",
    "in particular , the expressions for @xmath52 shows that the fragility of the liquid can be expressed in terms of parameters that quantify the `` energy landscape '' of the liquid .",
    "many recent computer simulation studies of dynamics and thermodynamics aspects of glass forming liquids have employed a binary mixture of atomic particles as a model system@xcite , as this system has been parametrized to prevent crystallization .",
    "results presented here are from molecular dynamics simulations of @xmath53 type @xmath12 and @xmath54 type @xmath13 particles .",
    "the particles interact _ via _ the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , with parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the lj potential is modified with a quadratic cutoff and shifting at @xmath60@xcite .",
    "all quantities are reported in reduced units , length in units of @xmath61 , volume @xmath62 in units of @xmath63 ( density @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the number of particles , in units of @xmath66 ) , temperature in units of @xmath67 , energy in units of @xmath68 and time in units of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the mass of the particles .",
    "argon units are used for the @xmath12 type particles when it is desirable to state values in si units , _",
    "i. e. _ @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations are performed over a wide range of temperatures at each density , with run lengths ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "local energy minimizations are performed for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) or @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) configurations to obtain typical local energy minima or ` inherent structures'@xcite sampled by the liquid .",
    "the hessian ( matrix of second derivatives of the potential energy ) evaluated at the minima are diagonalized to obtain the vibrational frequencies .",
    "as the binary lj liquid has mostly been studied at low temperatures and high densities , the location of the liquid - gas critical point has not previously been estimated .",
    "a rough estimate is obtained here by performing simulations in the appropriate range of @xmath15 and @xmath14 of length @xmath80 .",
    "isotherms close to the critical point are shown in fig .",
    "1 , which result in an estimate of the liquid - gas critical point of @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the glass transition locus was estimated in @xcite using diffusivity data fitted to the vft form ( eq.([eq : vft ] ) ) , and by thermodynamic means _ via _ eq .",
    "( [ eq : scdef ] ) ( by the condition that @xmath20 vanishes at the glass transition ) , where the total entropy of the liquid was obtained by thermodynamic integration from the ideal gas reference state ( details in @xcite ) .",
    "the liquid - gas spinodal locus was also obtained to study the relation between these two limits to the liquid state .",
    "the two loci are seen to intersect at a finite @xmath14 leading to the prediction of an ideal glass - gas mechanical instability locus at low temperatures .",
    "2 shows this `` phase diagram '' of the binary lj liquid , along with the locus of zero pressure ( which shows that at low enough density , the liquid is under tension at the simulated temperatures ) .",
    "the figure also shows the @xmath14 , @xmath15 points where simulations have been performed ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "the method of determining basin free energy and entropy ( eq.s [ eq : fbasin],[eq : sbdef ] ) from vibrational frequencies relies on the assumption that the basins are harmonic .",
    "some indirect tests of this assumption have been presented recently elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a direct test@xcite would be to thermally excite the inherent structures to excitation temperatures @xmath83 , and examine whether the energy of excitation above the inherent structure energy obeys the harmonic expectation of @xmath84 .",
    "the result of this test is shown in fig . 3 for @xmath85 , where inherent structures are selected from simulations at three different temperatures , and are subjected to thermal excitations at @xmath83 that span a range around the simulation temperature .",
    "in all cases , the deviation from the harmonic expectation is less than @xmath86 .",
    "surprisingly , the deviations are bigger at lower temperatures .",
    "the reason is most likely that very closely related minima with negligible barriers exist at all energies studied@xcite , and transitions between them occur even for low @xmath83 .",
    "nevertheless , the results in fig . 3 show that in practice , the harmonic approximation is quite valid for the binary lj liquid .",
    "as described in the previous section , the classical calculation of the basin entropies indicates that differences in basin entropy between two basins is independent of temperature , and remain finite at zero temperature .",
    "since this is not true in real materials ( where all entropies vanish at zero temperature ) , one must examine to what extent conclusions from such calculations apply to real systems .",
    "thre temperature range relevant to studying glass forming liquids is clearly the range above the glass transition temperature .",
    "further , the relevant quantity for the analysis above was the difference of basin entropies .",
    "therefore , if the quantum mechanical basin entropy differences correspond to a substantial fraction of the classical basin entropy differences above the glass transition , we may conclude that the classical approximation is reasonable .",
    "4 shows classical and quantum mechanical entropies obtained for basins sampled at two different temperatures ( one ` high ' , one ` low ' ) at two densities .",
    "it is clear ( panels ( a ) and ( d ) ) that the classical expression for the entropy deviates strongly from the quantum analog at low @xmath14 ( indeed , it diverges to @xmath87 as @xmath31 ) while approaching it at high @xmath14 .",
    "similarly the quantum mechanical entropy differences approach the constant classical value at high @xmath14 but decrease towards zero at low @xmath14 .",
    "nevertheless , at the glass transition temperature @xmath46 , the quantum mechanical difference is still about @xmath88 of the classical result . since argon units are used for the @xmath12 atoms , and most glass formers",
    "are made of considerably bulkier molecules than atomic argon , we may conclude that the classical result must apply well in most cases of interest .",
    "the discussion and results presented here indicate that the inherent structure approach is very useful in addressing interesting questions concerning the thermodynamics of glass forming liquids .",
    "it has been shown that the thermodynamic estimate of the glass transition locus agrees quite well with the one obtained from dynamic data@xcite .",
    "fruther , quantities such as the fragility of a liquid are reasonably well estimated by thermodynamic means , leading to an expression of fragility in terms of parameters that quantify the energy landscape of the liquid .",
    "additional data are presented here supporting the evaluation of basin entropies in a harmonic approximation and the classical calculations typically employed in such studies .",
