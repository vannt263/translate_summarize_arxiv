    "as already mentioned , the number of parameter sets which provide an acceptable fit for @xmath3 is much bigger than the number of parameter sets which provide an acceptable general fit .",

    "the corresponding @xmath113 values for @xmath140 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 functions are : @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "our main conclusion is that in the frame of a model based on quantum statistical principles and a space - time picture of an expanding source , a general description of the higher order correlations data with the same parameters , as those appearing in the first two correlation orders , is possible .",
    "the assumption of a gaussian form for the density matrix is consistent with the data .      on the other hand in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the momentum - space approach was used , the currents were assumed to be real and no simultaneous fit of all correlation functions has been performed .",
    "similar caveats apply to @xcite where an analysis of the same na22 data as those investigated in the present paper was presented and where only  marginal \" agreement with the simplified quantum optical model of @xcite was found .",
    "the fact that in the present work we could fit the same data supports the space - time approach and the necessity of a simultaneous fit .    besides the fact mentioned already that correlators in momentum - space are associated with a four dimensional  radius \" which has no clear physical interpretation , the space - time approach and the momentum - space approach differ also from a purely mathematical point of view . in @xcite",
    "the @xmath10 dependence is postulated from the beginning while in the present paper , as in @xcite , it results from a complex process of integration .    in @xcite",
    "the same momentum - space model ( @xcite ) as that used in @xcite was applied and compared with ua1-collaboration data .",
    "this time a new technique for estimating the correlation data was used but only second and third order correlations were considered . at first the best fit parameters set for the second order correlation data was established and then used to _ predict _ the third order correlation function , which was found to disagree with the measured one . given the insensitivity of of the fit parameters found by us on the @xmath140 function ,",
    "this result is not surprising and the fitting procedures used in @xcite ( as well as in in @xcite ) have to be qualified . furthermore the general reservations expressed above about the momentum - space approach apply here again .",
    "one may put the question why it is necessary to invoke higher order correlations to constrain the source parameters whereas the presence of a gaussian density matrix implies that the first and second moment of the current distribution , @xmath45 and @xmath159 , determine all higher order correlations .",
    "of eq.([eq : phase ] ) enter in different combinations in the various correlation functions .",
    "this is true both in the momentum - space approach @xcite , as well as in the space - time approach . in the application to data",
    "@xcite and @xcite of the quantum optical approach this complication was  circumvented \" by assuming that the fields are real . ]    in the applications of the space - time approach @xcite one has to take into account that due to the limited statistics , most experimental bec data including those analyzed in the present paper give the correlations in one single variable , @xmath10 . on the other hand , the correlation function @xmath140 , for instance , depends on 6 variables : the three momenta of the pions of the pair , @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "thus a large amount of information is lost due to the integration that projects out the @xmath10 dependence ( cf .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) .",
    "this is a fortiori true for higher order correlations .",
    "therefore phenomenologically higher order correlation data can play an important role in constraining the source parameters .    on the other hand",
    "the fact that we were able to account for the data even within this simplified approach , proves that there are still many degrees - of - freedom not used at the present level of theory / data comparison so that the challenge of disproving the gaussian density matrix will remain a hard task for a long time ahead .",

    "* figure 2 : * the same calculation as in figure 1 using the other set of parameters as defined in the text .",
