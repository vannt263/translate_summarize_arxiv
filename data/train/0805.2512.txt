    "soon after the first experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in dilute gases , binary bec mixtures were realized  @xcite .",
    "these experiments precipitated a strong theoretical interest , the origin of which is the fact that the multicomponent bec is not a trivial extension of the single - component bec  @xcite .",
    "indeed , novel and fundamentally different physics arise on both microscopic and macroscopic levels .",
    "phenomena studied for binary mixtures so far include the quantum tunnelling of spin domains  @xcite , spin - relaxation processes  @xcite , vortex configurations  @xcite , formation of feshbach molecules  @xcite and collective oscillations  @xcite .",
    "experiments with phase - segregated bec mixtures were established already in 1998  @xcite ; this triggered many theorists to focus on the observed weakly - segregated phases whereby the importance of the interface physics was highlighted several times  @xcite .",
    "also surfaces of _ single_-component bec gases have gained much attention .",
    "studies are performed on vortices , surface modes and tunnelling phenomena at the border of a trapped single - component bec  @xcite and on bec diffraction and van der waals forces using an optical mirror or evanescent - wave prism  @xcite .",
    "moreover a combination of the interface physics of binary bec gases and the surface physics near hard walls led to the theoretical prediction of anomalous wetting phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the clearest observation so far of phase segregation of bec mixtures was reported by papp et al .",
    "( see ref .  ) who used a mixture of @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb particles . by changing the particle numbers of both species and the intraspecies interactions of the @xmath0rb particles by use of a feshbach resonance ,",
    "many topologically distinct states were encountered . in the phase - segregated regime",
    "most trap configurations contained bec droplets .",
    "papp et al .  stated that a detailed theoretical understanding of the observed droplet formation is lacking .",
    "as an essential first step towards this understanding we present here expressions for the interface tension .",
    "moreover , we also formulate a method by which all trap configurations can be straightforwardly studied by the use of a local density approximation or thomas - fermi approximation . at first sight , numerically reproducing the experimentally observed ( meta)stable states requires solving the coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations for the full three - dimensional system ; in such case , a high accuracy is indispensable to capture the important energy contributions near the two - phase boundaries which strongly affect the ground state topology .    in this work , we argue that it is not necessary to solve the full gp system in order to recover numerically the experimental configurations ; instead , one can find the ground state , that is , minimize the total energy of the trapped cloud , by use of the thomas - fermi approximation and the expressions for the interface tension which we provide here .",
    "this allows an omission of the quantum pressure term which strongly complicates the numerical work .",
    "the analytical calculation of the interface tension is nontrivial as it involves solving the binary gp equations ( i.e.  two coupled nonlinear second - order differential equations ) .",
    "estimates and analytical expressions were already given in refs .",
    "- and were relevant to the early experiments on weakly - segregated mixtures but irrelevant to the interfaces as observed in ref .   since there segregation is not weak . by developing expansions , we succeed in obtaining analytical expressions for the interface tension which are accurate for almost all parameter regimes .    as a main result we find that , even though the interface tension is not constant throughout the trap , the total excess energy @xmath2 can be reduced to a simple integral of the trapping potential along the interface area @xmath3 : @xmath4^{3/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the intraspecies scattering length , the particle mass , the chemical potential and the applied trapping potential of phase @xmath9 .",

    "one can choose the order parameters to be real valued such that the equilibrium pressures for the _ pure _ states are : @xmath23 in order to study phase - segregated states of the two coexisting condensates , we introduce the parameter @xmath24 which quantifies the interspecies couplings relative to the average of the intraspecies couplings .",

    "note also that , as opposed to the grand canonical ensemble , the definition of the interface tension in the canonical ensemble is not unique  @xcite . in eq .",

    "it is clear from eq .   that the excess energy is positive and due to a bending of the normalized wave functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "one can now straightforwardly generalize the definition of the interface tension to the total excess energy of a trapped system .",
    "therefore we use a _ local approximation _ for the interface tension : we assume the characteristic lengths over which the trapping potentials @xmath53 ( for @xmath21 ) vary to be large as compared to the interface thickness . at each point",

    "then gives the expression for the interface tension @xmath55 for condensates at effective chemical potentials @xmath56 ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "this remarkable property implies that , first of all , along the entire interface in a trap , the interface profiles @xmath29 and @xmath30 are unchanged ( determined by eqs .   and only ) .",
    "this is an exceptional feature of bec interfaces   and their densities relate as @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 ) , and for which gp - like equations are valid . in that case",
    ", the normalized density profiles do depend on position unless @xmath61 , as valid for bec mixtures .",

    "secondly , it implies that in a trap the local interface tension @xmath55 depends on position only through the term @xmath62 as can be seen from eq .  .",
    "the _ total excess grand potential _ is then : @xmath63 which , using the effective chemical potentials @xmath56 in eqs .   and , brings us to eq .",
    "wherein we factorize the total excess energy as a product of two distinct terms : the first is a function of the microscopic gas parameters whereas the last is a position integral of the external potential along the interface area @xmath3 .",

    "expression   for the total excess energy is our main result . together with a thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation in bulk",
    ", it forms the core of a simple method to calculate the total energy of the trapped system and therefore to minimize it .",
    "the tf approach neglects the energy contributions arising from density gradients and thus gives rise to sharp interfaces , the locus of which is normally taken where two - phase coexistence is satisfied . the latter , however , is invalid when the interface is curved as appears for example for droplets .",
    "instead , a difference in pressures appears along the two - phase boundary as expressed by the laplace equation : @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 the principal radii of curvature of the interface .",
    "it is clear that the difference in pressures along the interface is largest for small droplets . within a first approach , for large @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", one can take the @xmath49 in eq .   to be the interface tension for a flat interface , calculated by assuming equal pressures on opposite sides of the interface .",
    "finally , note that , pertaining to the interface tension in a _ trapped _ system , it is essential to work at fixed chemical potentials instead of particle numbers and use definition   as opposed to the interface tension in the canonical ensemble  @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , the use of an interface tension for determining the excess energy in these experiments is inaccurate as the `` interface thickness '' , that is @xmath78 , is of the same order as the length of variation of the trapping potential ; this invalidates the assumption of constant chemical potentials across the interface .      in the following",

    ", we will consider these and ignore quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is common to incorporate the free energy contributions which arise from capillary excitations into a new temperature - dependent interface tension @xmath186 .",
    "generally , when the interface waves have wavenumbers @xmath187 and frequencies @xmath188 , one finds for a three - dimensional system that  @xcite : @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the interface tension at zero temperature and the last term embodies a negative correction due to a nonzero temperature . for a flat interface between two becs",
    ", one may obtain the capillary - wave spectrum from the time - dependent gp eqs .",
    "for sufficiently large wavelengths @xmath191 , one then finds for the modes with in - phase motion of both species  @xcite : @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the bulk density of phase @xmath21 .",
    "when the temperature @xmath194 satisfies the condition @xmath195 , only modes with wavenumbers satisfying eq .",
    "are thermally excited .",
    "the temperature - dependent interface tension then becomes  he by saam in ref .  .",
    "secondly , a full treatment would include the excitations which involve out - of - phase motions of the two bec components on either side of the interface .",
    "such modes were obtained by mazets in ref .  .",
    "however , all these additional modes are unimportant at low temperatures since they have a high energy at low wavenumber by their dispersion relations @xmath196 or @xmath197  @xcite . ] : @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the zeta and gamma function , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 , one calculates that the relative temperature corrections @xmath205/\\gamma_{_{12}}(0)$ ] are of order @xmath206 .",
    "it is known that @xmath207 is the condition for the gp theory to be applicable ; moreover for the current bec experiments @xmath208 is of the same order or less than @xmath7  @xcite .    on the other hand , for a system in the weakly segregated regime , the interface tension varies as @xmath209 and accordingly vanishes as @xmath68 .",
    "the relative temperature corrections are then of order @xmath210 which may become large as @xmath68 .    in conclusion , thermal fluctuations of a flat bec interface do not affect the interface tension at low temperature , except possibly near weak segregation .",
    "note that the calculated temperature dependence of the interface tension does not hold in trapped systems , as the interface modes there are quantized  @xcite .",
    "we discuss now the relevance of our results with respect to the recent experiments of papp et al .",
    "@xcite . two main values for the scattering lengths of phase - segregated states",
    "were reported : one configuration was characterized by @xmath211 and @xmath212 such that @xmath213 , while for the other configuration , @xmath214 and @xmath215 such that @xmath216 . here",
    "species @xmath9 and @xmath40 are @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb respectively .",
    "note that these values for @xmath13 are obtained both numerically and with eq .  .",
    "the values for @xmath13 together with eq .   allow a numerical calculation of the interface excess of any trapped configuration .",
    "as an example , we consider now the topology as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] in which a layer of @xmath0rb bec is present between clouds of @xmath1rb .",
    "this configuration was experimentally obtained in ref .   by strong radial confinement so as to quench gravitational effects .",
    "particles of phase @xmath60 are confined by an anisotropic trapping potential @xmath217 with @xmath218 .",
    "using eq .",
    ", one finds the total excess energy due to the presence of the two interfaces : @xmath219 here @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the maximal radial coordinates along the two interfaces ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and @xmath216 . comparing this excess energy @xmath222 with the total energy @xmath223 of a gas of @xmath224 @xmath1rb particles ,",
    "we obtain that @xmath225 .",
    "this implies that , even for the largest clouds observed in ref .  , the interface excess energy is substantial and must be considered accurately when determining the shape of the ground state configuration .    note that in recent experiments on ultracold imbalanced fermion gases , a breaking of the local density approximation was encountered in the sense that the introduction of the interface and its tension was essential in explaining the experiments  @xcite .",
    "the formalism presented in this work assumes a _ local approximation _ for the interface tension . for this approach to be valid , the interface thickness must be smaller than the length over which the trapping potential varies .",
    "generally , the former length is simply @xmath226 ; however , close to the mixed state ( i.e. when @xmath68 ) it is @xmath227 which is larger . on the other hand ,",
    "the characteristic variation length of the trapping potential of species @xmath228 is @xmath229 with @xmath230 . if we consider the configuration of @xmath231 particles with @xmath214 and @xmath215 , we find that @xmath232 is indeed small at the trap center  @xcite .",
    "although the coherence lengths diverge at the trap boundary , this divergence is so weak that @xmath226 exceeds @xmath233 only in a layer of thickness of @xmath234 of the trapping radius .",
    "this justifies the use of the local approximation for the interface in the experiments of ref .  .",
    "we propose a method to calculate the total energy of a trapped phase - segregated bec mixture . in order to find the bulk energies , one can use a local density approximation or thomas - fermi approach .",
    "however , with respect to the recent experiments on phase - segregated bec components  @xcite , the bulk contribution must be supplemented by interface excesses which may have pronounced effects on the ground state topology .",
    "the interface excess energy arises from the presence of the two - phase boundaries , the position of which are determined by the laplace equation . using a local approximation for the interface , we write the total excess energy as a simple integral of the trapping potential along the interface ( see eq .  ) . by use of analytical expansions ,",
    "we find the interface tension in almost all parameter regimes ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , including the regimes encountered in ref .  .",
    "we also study the influence of thermal fluctuations on the interface tension at low temperature and find that their effect is negligible , except possibly close to the mixed state .",
