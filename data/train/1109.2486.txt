    "entanglement based cryptography @xcite , equivalent formally to the bb84 scheme @xcite , is the one that uses the power of quantum entanglement monogamy obeyed by a maximally entangled pure quantum state . if the state is noisy then in some cases it is possible to run an entanglement distillation process @xcite which may be interpreted as quantum privacy amplification @xcite .",
    "since the final output is maximally entangled , it may be used directly for secret key generation .",
    "the efficiency of this procedure is quantified with distillable entanglement @xmath2 , which defines how many singlet states can be obtained in the asymptotic regime per one input .    still it was known that certain states which can not be prepared by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) are not distillable , exhibiting the phenomenon of bound entanglement @xcite . for a long time",
    "bound entanglement was believed to be useless for cryptography , but several years ago it was shown @xcite , that at least some bound entangled states may be useful in quantum cryptography .",
    "this is one extreme instance of the general fact that the amount of distillable secure key @xmath3 may exceed the amount of distillable singlets @xmath4 .",
    "the latter effect has been verified in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient in the complete theory of distilling a secret key from quantum states @xcite is the notion of a _ private bit _ , p - bit  or more generally a private dit , p - dit  which is a delocalized maximally entangled state that still retains some entanglement monogamy result .",
    "a quantum p - dit is composed from a @xmath5 key part @xmath6 , and the shield part @xmath7 , shared between alice ( subsystems @xmath8 ) and bob ( subsystems @xmath9 ) in such a way that the local von neumann measurements on the key part in a _",
    "particular _ basis will make its results completely statistically uncorrelated from the results of any measurement of an eavesdropper eve on her subsystem @xmath10 , which is a part of the purification @xmath11 of the p - dit state @xmath12 .",
    "there is a nice explanation how the shield part protects the statistics of the measurement on @xmath13 and @xmath14 to be correlated to eve : it just makes it impossible to distinguish the results of the measurement by an external observer .",
    "an obvious way to determine privacy properties is to reconstruct tomographically the complete p - dit state @xmath12 .",
    "this however is a very time consuming process , especially if the system under investigation is high - dimensional .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give bounds on the distillable secure key based just on few observables .",
    "this advances further the study presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was proposed to carry out a tomography of the so - called privacy - squeezed state of the state of merit .",
    "we demonstrate that a single observable suffices to provide a nontrivial bound .",
    "we also provide more accurate estimates based on two observables .",
    "these results provide tools for application - specific detection of entanglement , refining the fundamental concept of the entanglement witness proposed in @xcite and @xcite that can be also subjected to optimization with respect to local measurements @xcite and used to quantify the amount of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the present results can be viewed as an outcome of a more general research program : _ experimentally friendly detection / estimation of task - dedicated quantum entanglement and/or correlations_. in fact it is quite usual that we are interested in that aspect of entanglement which is useful for specific quantum information task .",
    "the quantity characterizing this aspect may be a monotone but we believe that it need not to be in general .",
    "for instance it is known that there are cases when specific bell inequalities which are important for device independent cryptography are better violated by nonmaximally entangled states . in this context we believe that the present paradigm will lead to systematic development of experimentally friendly detection / estimation of resources for quantum information tasks .",

    "let us start by reviewing how an individual observable can be used to estimate distillable entanglement @xmath2 .",
    "the most natural observable in this context is a projector @xmath15 onto a maximally entangled state @xmath16 of two @xmath17-level systems , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are any two orthonormal bases .",
    "following the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite dealing with the case @xmath20 , there is a protocol for an arbitrary @xmath17 such that if @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 then the state @xmath23 is distillable @xcite .",
    "the corresponding rate of the distillation protocol can be easily estimated from below by the hashing protocol @xcite which gives an estimate for the distillable entanglement as @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the von neumann entropy .",
    "since an application of the so - called @xmath26 twirling @xcite can only decrease distillable entanglement @xmath4 we may twirl the state @xmath27 in order to bring it to a highly symmetric form and then apply the hashing inequality ( [ hashing ] ) which eventually gives : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the shannon entropy .",
    "the above formula is valid for any bipartite quantum state @xmath27 .",
    "there are more sophisticated twirling protocols .",
    "for instance for two qubits there is a protocol @xcite utilizing selected random pauli operations that brings the state to a form diagonal in the bell basis : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are bell states . applying the hashing protocol to",
    "@xmath33 leads to : @xmath34 eqs .",
    "( [ fidelity ] ) and ( [ eq : ed>=bell ] ) provide bounds on the key rate for @xmath27 , as distilled singlet states can be used for the standard ekert protocol . in general",
    "however , this may be not the most efficient way to generate the key .    as pointed out in the introduction , a straighforward way to verify that we have a p - bit or a state close to p - dit enough that the secret key may be distilled .",
    "it is based on the so - called quantum state tomography which allows to calculate specific entropic functions that can be used to estimate the amount of the secret key from below .",
    "a useful quantity is the devetak - winter function @xmath35 which quantifies the secret key distillable through a specific one - way secret key distillation protocol : @xmath36 the devetak - winter function is given explicitly by the difference of two holevo quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 which characterize the amount of information that can be recovered respectively by bob and eve from subsystems @xmath14 and @xmath10 after alice carried out a von neumann measurement of the subsystem @xmath13 in the secure basis @xmath39 : k^_dw ( _ abab)= _ ab(_e_abe^ ) - _ ae ( _ b_abe^ ) .",
    "the state @xmath40 is given by : @xmath41    let us now restrict our attention to a situation when the key part is composed of two qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the complete density matrix @xmath42 can be written as a @xmath43 array of blocks @xmath44 : @xmath45 it can be transformed by locc ( with respect to the partition @xmath46 ) to the form :    @xmath47    which can be , , unwisted  to bell diagonal matrix which is directly related to privacy squeezed state ( see @xcite ) : @xmath48    where the norm @xmath49 stands for the trace norm .",
    "it will be convenient to write @xmath50 in the form : @xmath51 it is easy to see that @xmath50 is diagonal in the bell basis and the parameters @xmath52 are occupation probabilities of the corresponding bell states",
    ".    there is a useful bound on the secret key which is @xcite @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the classical mutual information for the outcomes of von neumann measurements carried out by alice and bob in the secure basis @xmath55 . as the joint probability distribution for these outcomes is @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the binary entropy .    note that the bound given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kd<=p1 ... p4 ] ) is weaker than that on distillable entanglement in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ed>=bell ] ) .",
    "this is because the state @xmath50 does not actually describe the physical system at any stage of the protocol , but is rather a formal construct characterizing privacy properties of the state @xmath59 of the complete system @xmath60 .",
    "the class of secrecy witnesses we shall consider here is defined formally as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is any hermitian matrix satisfying @xmath63 acting on the shield subsystems @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we will use the expectation value of the secrecy witness @xmath66 to approximate the value of @xmath67 .",

    "indeed , @xmath63 implies @xmath69 and consequently @xmath70 . sometimes the parameter @xmath71 may give exactly the value of @xmath72 .",
    "we will give an instance of that at the end of this section .",
    "let us also stress that the witness itself ( [ witness ] ) is an observable which must be measured on the original state ( [ initial - state ] ) .",
    "quantitative estimation of the distillable key will be based on the following inequality @xmath73 applied to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kd<=p1 ... p4 ] ) , which yields : @xmath74 as we are interested in the most pessimistic scenario , we need to minimize the right hand side over pairs @xmath75 that satisfy all the constraints .",
