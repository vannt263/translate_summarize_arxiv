    "a _ hinge _ in the euclidean space @xmath0 is formed when two @xmath1-dimensional bodies or two @xmath2-dimensional panels are articulated along a common @xmath3-dimensional affine space ( the hinge axis ) , so that the _ possible relative motions _ of one object with respect to the other consist only of _ rotations fixing the given hinge axis_. motion along the hinge axis is prohibited .",
    "this situation appears for _ molecular conformations _ in @xmath4 , when part of a molecule rotates with respect to the remaining part around an _ axis _ corresponding to a chemical bond .",
    "figure 1 schematically represents a piece of a protein backbone @xcite as a panel - and - hinge structure .",
    "we consider _ ordered chains _ of @xmath5 _ bodies _ or codimension - one _ panels _ @xmath6 , which are articulated _",
    "serially _ by @xmath7 hinges @xmath8 , with hinge @xmath9 linking @xmath10 and @xmath11 . from now on ,",
    "hinge axes will be simply called _ hinges _ or _ axes _ and will refer to the corresponding codimension - two affine subspace of the chain configuration .",
    "we assume that our abstract objects ( bodies or panels ) can move through one another . by identifying configurations which differ only by some rigid motion of the whole chain , the total _",
    "configuration space _ is naturally parametrized by the @xmath12-torus @xmath13 .",
    "we factor out these rigid motions by _ fixing the first object_. this also fixes the first hinge .",
    "clearly , a chain of hinged panels is simply a chain of hinged bodies subject to the condition that two consecutive hinge axes span only a codimension - one affine subspace ( the corresponding panel ) .",
    "to the last object , we may attach some _ frame _",
    "( e.g. a point , or a cartesian @xmath14-frame ) or some _ flag _",
    "( i.e. a sequence of linear subspaces , one included in the next ) , and study the _ end - frame _ or _ end - flag map _ which takes a configuration to its corresponding frame or flag position .",
    "note that the target is itself a manifold ( of frames or flags ) and the resulting map is differentiable .",
    "we study the _ singularities _ , or _ critical points _ of such maps , that is configurations corresponding to a _ drop in the rank of the differential_. we obtain geometrical characterizations of these singularities ( theorems [ thm : rank ] , [ thm : plucker ] , [ thm : confspace ] , [ thm : endframe ] ) valid in arbitrary dimension @xmath1 : they relate singular configurations to a lower dimensional span of the hinges in the corresponding projective grassmann variety @xmath15 .",
    "the most intuitive case , which was known in robotics @xcite , is the end - point map in dimension 3 , illustrated below .",
    "[ thm : endpoint3d ] consider a body - and - hinge chain in @xmath4 , with the first body fixed ( i.e. identified with the ambient @xmath4 ) and with a marked point @xmath16 on the last body @xmath17 .",
    "consider the end - point map :    @xmath18    which registers , for a given configuration @xmath19 of the chain , the corresponding position @xmath20 of the marked point in the ambient space @xmath4 .",
    "then , the the differential of this map :   @xmath21 is of rank @xmath22 if and only if there s a line through the end - point @xmath20 which is projectively incident with all the axes @xmath23 of the corresponding configuration .    _ projectively incident _ means intersecting in @xmath4 or parallel , that is : intersecting ` at infinity ' in the projective completion @xmath24 .    it should be emphasized that the intervention of a _ projective characterization of singularities _ is no accident - indeed , it echoes the known  projective invariance of infinitesimal rigidity \" in kinematics .",
    "see e.g. @xcite @xcite .",
    "we remark that , in dimension two , a body - and - hinge chain is as much as a panel - and - hinge chain , namely : a linkage given by @xmath5 rigid bars connected serially by revolute joints .",
    "this is , in other words , a _",
    "planar robot arm _ and the singularities of the end - point map are known to be precisely the configurations with all bars along the same line @xcite @xcite , which indeed is the content of our result in dimension two .",
    "thus , our hinge structures may be envisaged as higher dimensional versions of simple planar linkages . although there is a conversion dictionary between a hinge - structure description and a linkage description in arbitrary dimension - as we outline in section [ sec : cyclestolinkages ] , the former language seems better suited for characterizing singularities .",
    "we reinforce this aspect by discussing in section [ sec : platforms ] a related case in kinematics : infinitesimally flexible platforms .",
    "the results in this paper have been presented at the eighth international symposium on _ effective methods in algebraic geometry ( mega ) _ 2005 , porto conte , alghero , sardinia , may 26-june 2 , 2005 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote @xmath1-dimensional bodies in @xmath0 . to be precise , one should think of each @xmath26 as a copy of @xmath0 , free to move relative to the ambient @xmath0 .",
    "one may attach a cartesian frame to the copy and represent the movement of the body as the movement of the frame .",
    "we put a hinge @xmath9 between @xmath10 and @xmath27 , that is : we distinguish a codimension - two affine subspace ( an axis ) in @xmath10 and one in @xmath11 , and we specify an isometry between them , and the two linked bodies are now supposed to be positioned in the ambient @xmath0 subject to the condition that the two marked axes coincide , and realize the specified isometry . the common axis , as seen in the ambient @xmath0 , or on each of the bodies so linked ,",
    "will be denoted @xmath9 .",
    "* we shall identify the first body with the ambient @xmath0 * , i.e. fix it as the reference body , because we are interested in configurations only up to a rigid motion of the assembled chain .",
    "clearly a hinge between two bodies allows one to rotate with respect to the other , with the hinge axis remaining pointwise fixed .",
    "this relative motion is parametrized by the unit circle @xmath28 . thus ,",
    "with @xmath29 fixed , the _ configuration space _ of the chain of @xmath5 hinged bodies is parametrized by @xmath13 .",
    "we distinguish now some particular point of the _ last _ body in the chain :   @xmath30 , and call it _ the end - point_. ( obviously , we may assume @xmath16 to be away from the last axis @xmath31 , since otherwise we would restrict considerations to @xmath7 bodies . )",
    "this produces a map ( to be denoted by @xmath16 as well ) :    @xmath32    which associates to a configuration @xmath19 , the position @xmath20 of the end - point with respect to the ambient space i.e. @xmath29",
    ". this will be our _ end - point map_.    our first concern is to describe the _ singularities of the end - point map _ , that is : the configurations @xmath33 where the tangent map @xmath21 has rank _ strictly less _ than its generic rank .",
    "we have :    [ thm : rank ] @xmath34 if and only if there s a line through @xmath20 which is projectively incident with all the axes @xmath35 of the corresponding configuration .    note that @xmath36 is fixed , and the line through the end - point in the theorem is either intersecting an axis or parallel to it ( i.e. meeting it `` at infinity '' , when we complete @xmath0 to the projective space @xmath37 ) .    _",
    "proof : _  the image of the differential @xmath21 is spanned by the tangent vectors at @xmath20 to the circles ( or circles degenerated to a point ) described by the end - point @xmath20 in the ambient @xmath0 , when rotated around each axis @xmath38 .    this span is less than the full tangent space @xmath0 at @xmath20 if and only if there s a line @xmath39 through @xmath20 , normal to it .",
    "but @xmath39 , will then be projectively incident with all axes .",
    "indeed , if @xmath20 happens to be on some axis , there s nothing to prove for that axis , while otherwise , @xmath39 must lie in the hyperplane spanned by the axis under consideration , say @xmath40 and @xmath20 , which is the hyperplane normal to to the tangent at @xmath20 for the circle described while rotating around @xmath40 .",
    "this is , essentially , a partial derivative at @xmath19 .    by the same elementary theorem ,",
    "if a line @xmath39 passing through @xmath20 is projectively incident with all axes , it will be normal to @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42    [ cor : orthogonal ] the space orthogonal to @xmath41 is swept by all lines through the end - point @xmath20 which are projectively incident to all axes @xmath43 .",
    "[ cor : onto ] for @xmath44 and a generic choice of hinge axes , the differential of the end - point map is generically onto , and its singularities are precisely the configurations which allow some line through the end - point to be projectively incident with all axes .    * remarks : *  i )  the geometric argument used above does not even require to be specific about the parametrization of the configuration space by @xmath13 , e.g. what position is considered for @xmath45 .",
    "it is enough to follow the infinitesimal displacements of the end - point resulting from rotating as one body the part of the chain from @xmath26 on , around @xmath46 .",
    "ii )  this approach also shows that _ for infinitesimal considerations _ , the _ order of the axes _ may turn out to be irrelevant , while clearly essential otherwise .",
    "iii )  we have emphasized in our statements the _ purely projective characterization of the singularities_. this is consistent with , in fact tantamount to the related phenomenon for linkages ( cf .",
    "the so - called `` projective invariance of infinitesimal rigidity '' @xcite ) .    for * chains of hinged panels in @xmath4 *",
    ", the line @xmath39 in the theorem must either pass through the projective intersection of the two axes of an intermediate panel , or be contained in it ; and is always contained in the last panel .",
    "we begin by reviewing a few facts about the _ homogeneous manifolds _",
    "@xmath47 defined by _ all orthogonal ( i.e. cartesian ) @xmath14-frames in @xmath0_.    one such frame consists of a point in @xmath0 ( to be thought of as the origin of the frame ) and @xmath14 ordered unit vectors which are mutually orthogonal .    clearly ,",
    "for @xmath48 , we can identify the manifold @xmath49 of all @xmath1-frames in @xmath0 with the _ isometry group _ @xmath50 of @xmath0 :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 stands for the real orthogonal group in dimension @xmath1 , consisting of all orthogonal @xmath53 matrices .",
    "( the columns of an orthogonal matrix are the vectors of a @xmath1-frame . )",
    "the pair @xmath54 gives the isometry :  @xmath55 .",
    "suppose now @xmath56 , and note that one can parametrize all systems of @xmath14 ordered , mutually orthogonal unit vectors in @xmath0 by the homogeneous space @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is identified with the subgroup of @xmath52 fixing the first @xmath14 vectors in the standard basis ) .",
    "( these homogeneous spaces are called stiefel manifolds . )",
    "this gives the general description :    @xmath59    @xmath60    notice that there s a _",
    "natural action _ of the group of isometries in dimension @xmath14 :  @xmath61 , on the space of @xmath14-frames in @xmath0 :  @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath62    a @xmath14-frame gives an identification of its span with @xmath63 , and @xmath61 acts by displacing the given frame to the image of the standard basis .",
    "thus the action preserves the @xmath14-plane spanned by a frame ( through its origin ) , that is : a @xmath14-frame and its transforms have the same ` supporting ' @xmath14-plane .",
    "let us fix a @xmath14-frame @xmath64 in the last body @xmath65 of a hinged chain .",
    "as in the case of a point @xmath66 , this gives an * end - frame map * :    @xmath67    takig a configuration @xmath19 to the corresponding position of the end @xmath14-frame in the ambient @xmath0 .",
    "again , for the singularities of the end - frame map , only the positions of the axes matter , not their ordering , and the remarks on the action of @xmath61 on @xmath47 give :    [ prop : singularities ] the singularities of the end - frame map :    @xmath68    depend only on the set of axes and the @xmath14-plane spanned by the end - frame .",
    "it may be useful in this context to cosider explicitly the map which takes a @xmath14-frame to the ( affine ) @xmath14-plane it spans in @xmath0 , as a map to the grassmann variety @xmath69 parametrizing all @xmath70 linear subspaces in @xmath71 , that is : all projective @xmath14-planes in @xmath37 :    @xmath72    the axes themselves can be seen as points in @xmath73 , and our proposition says that the singularities of the end - frame map depend only on @xmath35 , and @xmath74 as a point of @xmath75 .    in order to see what kind of geometrical characterization of singularities should emerge , we look in the next section at the case @xmath76 .",
    "a @xmath3-frame on the last body may be interpreted as a ` loose hinge ' , or half a hinge , and if we prescribe its matching half i.e. a @xmath3-frame in the ambient @xmath0 ( which is the first body ) , we may interpret _ the fibers of the end - frame map _",
    "@xmath77 , as _ configuration spaces of cycles of @xmath5 hinged bodies _ , for various placements of the closing hinge .",
    "when we take @xmath76 , proposition 2.1 says that the singularities of @xmath77 depend on corresponding configurations of @xmath5 points in the grassmann variety @xmath78 .",
    "since the singularities of the map indicate singularities of the fibers , and the fibers , in this case , are cycles of @xmath5 bodies with @xmath5 hinges , we see that the _ order _ of the @xmath5 points in the grassmannian is not actually relevant .",
    "we should add the remark that our set - up generalizes the case @xmath79 of the planar ` robot arm ' and planar polygon spaces @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "in that case , one has singularities if and only if all @xmath5 axes ( which are simply points in @xmath80 ) are _ collinear_. in general , we have :    [ thm : plucker ] suppose @xmath81 .",
    "consider the plcker embedding of the grassmann variety :    @xmath82    the end - frame map for a chain of @xmath5 hinged bodies in @xmath0 :    @xmath83    has a singularity at @xmath33 if and only if the @xmath5 points of @xmath78 corresponding to the axes @xmath38 , @xmath84 and the span @xmath85 of the end - frame , all lie in some hyperplane section of the grassmannian ( in its plcker embedding ) .    note that :  @xmath86 .    in terms of cycles",
    ", we have the simpler , but equivalent formulation :    [ thm : confspace ] the configuration space parametrizing the possible positions ( up to euclidean motions ) of a cycle of @xmath81 hinged bodies in @xmath0 is singular whenever the @xmath5 axes , as points in    @xmath82    span less than the whole ambient projective space of the grassmannian .",
    "note that a generic ( initial ) position of the @xmath5 axes gives a configuration space of dimension @xmath87 .",
    "_ proof : _",
    "we extend the argument presented by bricard in tome ii , note h of @xcite .",
    "an infinitesimal motion of our chain of @xmath5 hinged bodies in @xmath0 corresponds with relative infinitesimal motions for each couple :    @xmath88    which are all tangent to uniform rotations with axes @xmath89 .    a simple way to encode a uniform rotation around a codimension two axis @xmath90 uses an arbitrary point @xmath91 and an element @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a basis of the subspace @xmath94",
    ", whose exterior power @xmath95 represents the angular velocity of the rotation .",
    "the information @xmath96 , which generalizes the notion of sliding vector ( vecteur glissant ) in dimension three , can also be presented as an exterior vector :    @xmath97    when we consider @xmath0 as the affine subspace @xmath98 in @xmath71 with the origin @xmath99 , so that @xmath100 .",
    "thus uniform rotations become representatives for points in @xmath78 determined by their ( affine ) axes .",
    "the component @xmath101 in @xmath102 expresses the velocity of @xmath103 rotating with respect to @xmath104 .    when we fix representatives @xmath105 for all axes @xmath106 , we have :  @xmath107 .",
    "the result of the relative infinitesimal motions given by @xmath108 on the corresponding couples @xmath109 is clearly the identity when considered relative to one and the same body , say @xmath110 .",
    "thus , generalizing the null torsor condition in dimension three , we must have :    @xmath111    indeed , the resulting velocities must be zero at the origin @xmath112 and elswhere :    @xmath113    @xmath114    the last condition gives :    @xmath115    and @xmath116 follows .",
    "the dimension of the space of solutions @xmath117 of equation @xmath116 is @xmath118 , hence : the configuration space has a singularity if and only if the axes span less than the whole ambient space of the grassmannian .",
    "@xmath42    * remarks : *  in the generically _ rigid _ case for cycles , namely @xmath119 , a singularity in the configuration space means _ infinitesimal flexibility_.    in space @xmath120 , we would have a cycle of 6 hinged bodies or panels . the case of 6 panels",
    "corresponds to the _ cyclo - hexane molecule _ , and when phrased in terms of linkages to 1-skeleta of octahedra .",
    "thus , our result recovers characterizations of infinitesimal flexibility for objects of some long - standing interest @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . a hyperplane section of the grassmann - plcker quadric @xmath121 is also called a linear complex .",
    "a note of darboux to koenigs _ ` leons de cinmatique ' _ , p.431 , mentions a fact known to chasles : _ a twisted cubic in @xmath122 has all its tangents in the same linear complex i.e. a rational normal cubic has all its tangents in the same hyperplane section of the grassmannian @xmath123_.    other examples of six lines in a linear complex come from bricard s flexible octahedra .",
    "in particular , as observed in @xcite ( sect .",
    "17 ) , a six - cycle in @xmath4 with _ hinges symmetric in pairs relative to an axis _ , has one degree of freedom of motion . to see that the hinges are linearly dependent in @xmath124 , note that the symmetry in a line , as a projective transformation @xmath125 , can be given by a diagonal matrix with two @xmath126 and two @xmath127 eigenvalues , hence inducing an involution with two @xmath126 and four @xmath127 eigenvalues on @xmath128 .",
    "thus @xmath129 are dependent .",
    "suppose @xmath130 , and consider a @xmath14-frame attached to the last body of a chain . clearly , any extension of this @xmath14-frame to a @xmath131-frame gives a factorization of the end - frame map @xmath64 through @xmath132 :    @xmath133    the differential of the last arrow is surjective at all points , and it follows that the singularities of @xmath64 are contained in the singularities of @xmath132 , for any extension of the end - frame .",

[ lemma : genericcycle ] let @xmath198 be a generic @xmath5-cycle in @xmath0 with axes @xmath89 . for @xmath199 sufficiently close to @xmath178",
    ", we have :    @xmath200    this is the analogon of `` a small cut at a vertex '' for polygon spaces .",
    "the proof , as in that case , amounts to observing that the fibers of the end - frame map :    @xmath181    over a small neighborhood of @xmath180 can be identified with @xmath201 .",
    "when we look at @xmath5-cycles as points in @xmath202 _ modulo the diagonal action of the group of euclidean motions in _ @xmath0 , we have a parameter space of dimension @xmath203 containing cycle configuration spaces of generic dimension @xmath87 .",
    "thus , a parameter space for the cycle configuration spaces , that is : _ a moduli space _ , should have dimension @xmath204 . in other words ,",
    "we expect @xmath204 continuous parameters ( also called _ invariants _ or _ moduli _ ) , to characterize a generic configuration space , at least up to a finite number of possibilities .",
    "* example : *  for the planar case @xmath205 , with @xmath5-cycles understood as @xmath5-gons with prescribed edges , the obvious invariants are the _ edge lengths _ themselves .",
    "admissible edge - length - vectors _ make - up a polyhedreal cone in @xmath206 ( with section a second hypersimplex ) .",
    "the various topological types for planar polygon configuration spaces are then described in terms of a subdivision into chambers of this cone .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite    according to the previous section , the canonical linkage @xmath188 associated to a generic cycle @xmath207 may be envisaged as an _ invariant _ of the cycle configuration space in dimension @xmath208 .",
    "this gives , upfront , @xmath158 edge lengths , but we have a number of _ orthogonalities _ in all canonical realizations , which make @xmath157 distances dependent on the remaining @xmath204 .",
    "thus , one obtains @xmath204 invariants .",
    "however , the cone they determine in @xmath209 is more complicated than in the planar case .",
    "obviously _ rescaling _ does not change the structure of the configuration spaces , and we may replace the cone with a transversal section of dimension @xmath210 , corresponding to ratios of invariants .",
    "in this section we present a complementary result in kinematics , meant to emphasize the fact that _ line geometry _ ( or dually , axis geometry ) , that is : the use of grassmann varieties @xmath211 , provides a natural context for singularity issues .",
    "our example may be envisaged as a generalization of a theorem of desargues , form the ` perspective ' of ` platforms ' . for background on infinitesimal rigidity",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a * platform * in @xmath0 consists of two ( rigid ) bodies connected by @xmath212 rigid bars with ends @xmath213 on one body , respectively @xmath214 on the other . for @xmath79",
    "we connect the vertices of two triangles with three bars , and the resulting framework is infinitesimally flexible precisely when the triangles are in perspective for the given pairing of vertices : in other words , they produce a desargues configuration .",
    "this generalizes to :    [ prop : platform ] a platform in dimension @xmath1 is infinitesimally flexible if and only if the @xmath212 lines defined by the connecting bars @xmath215 lie in a hyperplane section of the grassmannian @xmath216 .    _ proof ; _  we use a ` projective ' version of the paltform , by imagining @xmath0 as @xmath217 in @xmath71 and the origin linked by bars to @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "we may consider the first body fixed , and the infinitesimal motion of the second given by an anti - symmetric @xmath218 matrix @xmath198 .",
    "an infinitesimal motion of the platform requires :    @xmath219    and this linear system in the unknowns @xmath220 has a non - trivial solution precisely when the exterior two - vectors :  @xmath221 , @xmath222 are linearly dependent .",
