    "since the seminal works of @xcite and @xcite , it is well understood that a black hole ( bh ) can emit particles from its event horizon with a certain temperature , so - called the hawking temperature ( @xmath1 ) , which is proportional to the surface gravity , @xmath2 of the bh .",
    "therefore , a distant observer could detect a thermal radiation , i.e. hawking radiation , that spreads throughout the bh surroundings .",
    "in fact , this is the way that a bh ends .",
    "today there are various methods to compute the @xmath1 in the literature , ( see for instance @xcite , and it is always high on the agenda to find alternative derivations . as for us , none of the methods is catchy as the hawking s original study @xcite in which the hawking temperature is revealed by the computation of the bogoliubov coefficients between in and out states for a collapsing bh .",
    "another alternative method which is conclusive as the method of the bogoliubov coefficients is the computation of the reflection coefficient of an incident wave by the bh .",
    "thereby , the thermal radiation spectrum and hence the @xmath1 are obtained precisely @xcite .",
    "the latter method especially serves the purpose when the wave equation on the associated geometry is solved exactly .",
    "this method is known as the `` semi - classical radiation spectrum method '' , and we call it as _ scrsm _ throughout the paper like in @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite have shown us that when the _ scrsm _ is applied for the non - asymptotically flat ( naf ) charged massive dilaton bhs without cosmological constant @xmath0 in which they have only a single ( event ) horizon , one can reach to the @xmath1 which is in general computed by the conventional method : @xmath3 .",
    "the way followed so far for this purpose in the _ scrsm _ was to take merely the high frequency limit of the obtained temperature @xmath4 of the radiation spectrum in which @xmath5  represents the frequency of the scalar wave .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to explore the effect of the @xmath0  on the radiation spectrum of the charged dilaton bhs .",
    "namely , we intend to fill a gap in this line of thought . to this end",
    ", we will consider another naf static and charged dilaton bh . unlike the previous studies , the considered bh is a three dimensional ( 3d ) solution to the einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory with cosmological constant @xmath0  ( emd@xmath0 theory ) , which is found by @xcite .",
    "as implied above , the inclusion of the @xmath0 enables the bh to possess two horizons instead of one . here ,",
    "after a straightforward calculation of the _ scrsm _ , it is seen that the high frequency limit of the computed @xmath4 does not lead it directly to the @xmath1 of the charged dilaton bhs as such in the former studies @xcite . for matching , it is not only enough to consider the low frequency regime but one needs  to impose some special conditions on the wave as well .",
    "another interesting point which comes in this regard is that the @xmath0 remains as a decisive factor on the associated conditions about the wave .",
    "all these points together with supporting plots will be examined in the following sections .",
    "the lay out of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "ii , we start with a brief review of the 3d charged dilaton bh solution in the emd@xmath0 theory .",
    "the next section is devoted to the analytical computation of the @xmath4 via the _ scrsm _ for the associated bhs .",
    "some remarks about how the @xmath4  goes to the @xmath1 of the charged dilaton bh are made , and these remarks are illustrated by the various plots .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sect .",
    "in this section we will review the geometrical and thermodynamical properties of the 3d charged dilaton bhs .",
    "the associated bhs were found long ago by @xcite .",
    "these bhs are exact solutions to the equations of motion of the emd@xmath0 action which is conformably related to the low - energy string action .",
    "this action is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for the maxwell field , the constants @xmath8 are arbitrary constants , @xmath9 is the dilaton field , @xmath10 is the ricci scalar in 3d and @xmath11  as already mentioned in the previous section , represents the cosmological constant ; @xmath12 stands for the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , and @xmath13 represents  the de sitter ( ds ) spacetime .",
    "the corresponding static circularly symmetric solution @xcite to the above action is given by @xmath14 where the metric function is @xmath15 one can readily see that the spacetime ( 2 ) possesses a naf geometry , therefore it does not behave asymptotically as ds or ads @xcite .",
    "this is due to the presence of the nontrivial dilaton field @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding dilaton field @xmath9 and the non - zero maxwell tensor @xmath16 are @xmath17   , \\nonumber\\\\ f_{tr }   &   = \\frac{2}{n}\\gamma^{-\\frac{2}{n}}r^{\\frac{2}{n}-2}qe^{4a\\phi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is related with electric charge , @xmath19 and whence @xmath20 are constants , and @xmath21 is another constant which is governed by @xmath22 as it was stated in the paper @xcite , when @xmath23 and @xmath24 the solutions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) represent bhs . in this case , the constant @xmath25 of the metric function ( 3 ) is related with the quasilocal mass @xmath26 @xcite of the bh . by employing the brown - york formalism @xcite , one can find the following relationship @xmath27 from the above expression , one can infer that for @xmath28 , @xmath25 should take negative values .",
    "similar to the work @xcite , throughout this paper we restrict attention to the bhs described by @xmath29 . these choices modify the metric function , the dilaton field and the maxwell field to @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 when @xmath33 , the spacetime ( 2 ) represents a bh . for @xmath34 , two horizons of the bh are found in the following locations @xmath35 where @xmath36 in ( 8) , @xmath37  and @xmath38 denote outer and inner horizons of the bh , respectively . besides , there is a timelike singularity at @xmath39 .",
    "these charged bhs possess a hawking temperature ( @xmath40 ) that it can be computed from the definition given by @xcite @xmath41 the prime symbol in the foregoing equation , and in the following sections , denotes the derivative with respect to the variable `` @xmath42 '' .",
    "for the extreme bhs with @xmath43 which is equivalent to @xmath44 one can immediately verify that @xmath40 vanishes .",
    "furthermore , for the uncharged ( @xmath45 or @xmath46 ) bhs the hawking temperature ( @xmath47 )  becomes @xmath48",
    "in this section , by using the _ scrsm _ @xcite , we will make more precise calculation of the temperature @xmath4  of the radiation for the 3d charged dilaton bhs which are introduced in the previous section . after obtaining the @xmath4 ,",
    "its @xmath47 and @xmath40 limits will be discussed in detail . for this purpose",
    ", we will first develop the wave equation for a massless scalar field in the background of the charged dilaton bh .",
    "although the calculations made here share partial similarities with the studies @xcite , for the sake of completeness we would like to describe the details .",
    "the general equation for a massless scalar field in a curved spacetime is written as @xmath49 where the dalembertian operator @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 the scalar wave function @xmath52 of ( 12 ) can be separated into a radial equation by letting @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a complex integration constant . meanwhile , before proceeding to the derivation of the radial equation , in order to facilitate the computations , it is better to rewrite the metric function @xmath55 ( 7 ) as   @xmath56 after inserting the ansatz ( 14 ) into the wave equation ( 12 ) , the radial equation becomes @xmath57 the above equation can be solved in terms of hypergeometric functions . here , we give the final result as @xmath58 \\nonumber\\\\ &   + c_{2}(r - r_{+})^{-i\\tilde{\\omega}r_{+}}(r - r_{-})^{-i\\tilde{\\omega}r_{-}}\\\\ &   \\times f\\left [   \\tilde{a}-\\tilde{c}+1,\\tilde{b}-\\tilde{c}+1;2-\\tilde { c};y\\right ]   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters of the hypergeometric functions are @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62  is assumed to have positive real values .",
    "next , setting @xmath63 one gets the behavior of the partial wave near the outer horizon ( @xmath64 ) as @xmath65 we assign the constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 as the amplitudes of the near - horizon outgoing and ingoing waves , respectively .    to obtain the asymptotic solution ( @xmath68 ) of ( 17 ) , one can perform a transformation of the hypergeometric functions of any argument ( let us say @xmath69 ) to the hypergeometric functions of its inverse argument ( @xmath70 ) which is given as follows @xcite @xmath71 applying this transformation to ( 17 ) , one can find the solution to the wave equation in the asymptotic region as follows @xmath72   \\right .",

    "+ d_{2}\\exp i\\left [   \\frac{x}{\\lambda r_{+}}(-\\sigma+\\tilde{\\omega } r_{-})-\\omega t\\right ]   \\right\\ }   .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , since we consider the case of @xmath73 the overall - factor term behaves as @xmath74 therefore , the wave near the infinity ( 23 ) reduces to @xmath75   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspond to the amplitudes of the asymptotic outgoing and ingoing waves , respectively .",
    "one can derive the relations between @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 as the following .",
    "@xmath78 @xmath79 according to the _ scrsm _ , hawking radiation is considered as the inverse process of scattering by the bh in which the outgoing mode at the spatial infinity should be absent @xcite . in short ,",
    "@xmath80 in ( 26 ) .",
    "this yields the coefficient of reflection @xmath81 of the wave by the bh as @xmath82 which corresponds to @xmath83   \\cosh\\left [   \\pi\\left (   \\sigma-\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda}\\right ) \\right ]   } { \\cosh\\left [   \\pi\\left (   \\sigma+\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda y}\\right ) \\right ]   \\cosh\\left [   \\pi(\\sigma+\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda})\\right ]   } , \\ ] ] since the resulting radiation spectrum is @xmath84 one can easily read the more precise value of the temperature as @xmath85   } { \\cosh\\left [   \\pi\\left ( \\sigma-\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda y}\\right )   \\right ]   } \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ &   \\left .",
    "\\times\\frac{\\cosh\\left [   \\pi(\\sigma+\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda } ) \\right ]   } { \\cosh\\left [   \\pi\\left (   \\sigma-\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda}\\right ) \\right ]   } \\right\\ }   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after analyzing the above result , it is seen that there are two prominent cases depending on which frequency regime ( high / low ) is taken into consideration .    * case i : * in the high frequency regime with the condition of @xmath86 ( this case is also possible with a shift @xmath87 in the ansatz ( 14 ) of the wave function ) , the term @xmath88always predominates the@xmath89physical parameter @xmath90i.e.,@xmath91 , and the temperature ( 31 ) reduces to @xmath92   \\exp\\left (   \\pi\\frac{\\omega } { 2\\lambda}\\right )   } { \\exp\\left [   \\pi\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda}\\left (   \\frac { 1}{y}-1\\right )   \\right ]   } \\right\\ }   } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath93   } , \\\\ &   = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which smears out the @xmath94dependence , and the spectrum results in a isothermal radiation .",
    "in addition to this , one can immediately observe that the above result is nothing but the @xmath47 ( 11 ) , and the temperature of the radiation becomes independent from the horizons of the charged dilaton bhs at the high frequencies .",
    "in other words , in the high frequency regime the charge completely loses its effectiveness on the temperature of the radiation .",
    "another interesting aspect of this case is that there is no possibility to retrieve the @xmath40 ( 10 ) contary to the former studies @xcite in which the high frequency regime was considered as the master regime in obtaining the conventional hawking temperature ( @xmath95 ) of a bh .",
    "* case ii : * in the low frequency regime with the conditions of @xmath96 ( this case can not be obtained by shifting @xmath87 in the ansatz ( 14 ) of the wave function ) and @xmath97 , the ratios of the hyperbolic cosines behave as @xmath98   } { \\cosh\\left [   \\pi\\left ( \\sigma-\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda y}\\right )   \\right ]   } \\simeq\\frac{\\exp\\left [ \\pi\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda}\\left (   1+\\frac{1}{y}\\right )   \\right ]   } { \\exp\\left [ \\pi\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda}\\left (   1-\\frac{1}{y}\\right )   \\right ]   } , \\ ] ] and @xmath99   } { \\cosh\\left [   \\pi\\left ( \\sigma-\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda}\\right )   \\right ]   } \\simeq\\exp\\left (   \\pi \\frac{\\omega}{2\\lambda}\\right )   , \\ ] ] thus for this case , the @xmath4 given by ( 31 ) becomes @xmath100   \\exp\\left (   \\pi\\frac{\\omega } { 2\\lambda}\\right )   } { \\exp\\left [   \\pi\\frac{\\omega}{4\\lambda}\\left (   1-\\frac { 1}{y}\\right )   \\right ]   } \\right\\ }   } , \\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\frac{2\\lambda}{\\pi}\\left (   \\frac{y}{1+y}\\right )   , \\\\ &   = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi}(1-\\frac{r_{_{-}}}{r_{+}}),\\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\frac{m}{4\\pi r_{+}}y.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which exactly matches with the result of the conventional hawking temperature of the charged dilaton bhs i.e. , @xmath40 ( 10 ) . the case ii has also the limit of @xmath47 ( 11 ) when @xmath46 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "furthermore , we would like to represent the most interesting figures about the spectrum temperature @xmath4 ( 31 ) .",
    "for this purpose , we plot @xmath4 versus wave frequency @xmath5 of the 3d charged dilaton bhs with @xmath101 for both cases .",
    "fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 illustrate the thermal behaviors of the charged dilaton bhs in the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , respectively . as it can be seen from both figures , at the high frequencies the temperature @xmath4 exhibits similar behaviors such that it approaches to @xmath47 ( 11 ) while @xmath102 however , in the low frequencies the picture changes dramatically . in this regard , if we first consider the fig .",
    "1 , it is obvious that as @xmath103 the @xmath4 tends to diverge .",
    "besides , fig . 1 presents that there is no chance to have @xmath40 ( 10 ) from the @xmath4 if @xmath104 the minimum value of the @xmath105  that it can drop , which is also equal to @xmath47 , is higher than the value of the @xmath40 .",
    "however , when we look at the fig .",
    "2 , for a specific range of the low frequencies in which the conditions for the case ( ii ) hold it is seen that @xmath4 coincides with @xmath106 to our knowledge , the latter result that reveals a relationship between the hawking temperature , the cosmological constant and the low frequencies ( or long wavelengths ) of the scalar waves is completely new for the literature .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the frequency dependent temperature @xmath4 of the radiation spectrum for the 3d charged dilaton bhs in the emd@xmath0 theory . for this purpose ,",
    "we have made use of the previously obtained method , _",
    "scrsm_. its related studies @xcite showed us that whenever the wave equation admits an exact solution , this method is powerful enough to obtain the hawking temperature of a considered bh . by using this fact ,",
    "we have first obtained the massless scalar wave equation in that geometry . after finding the exact solution of the radial part in terms of the hypergeometric functions and using their one of the linear transformation expressions ,",
    "we have obtained the @xmath107 from here on , we have analyzed in detail the behavior of @xmath4 with various parameters .",
    "it is seen that two cases come to the forefront during the analysis .",
    "the associated cases , which are called as `` case i '' and `` case ii '' , mainly depend on the which frequency regime ( high / low ) is considered , the sign of the term @xmath108 and the domination of the terms @xmath62  and @xmath109 against to each other .",
    "it is deduced from the calculations and their associated figures that in the case i ( @xmath86 and @xmath110 within the high frequency regime ) @xmath4 does not yield the standard hawking temperature of the 3d charged dilaton bhs ( @xmath40 ) , it has only the @xmath47 limit . on the other hand , the case ii",
    "in which the frequency regime is low and @xmath96 with @xmath111 makes the _ scrsm _ agree with the @xmath40 .",
    "this result , by contrast with the previous studies @xcite , represents that the presence of the @xmath0 allows us to obtain the desired hawking temperature @xmath40 in the low frequency ( or long wavelength ) regime .",
    "the latter remark might also play a crucial role in the detection of the charged dilaton black holes with the cosmological constant in the future ."
