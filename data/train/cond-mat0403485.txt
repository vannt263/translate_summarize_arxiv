    "the kondo effect represents a distinguished example of strong many - body correlations in condensed matter physics.@xcite over the last fifteen years , much effort has been made in understanding the implications of the kondo effect on the scattering properties of phase - coherent conductors .",
    "indeed , the electric transport through a quantum dot connected to two terminals becomes highly correlated when the temperature @xmath0 is lowered below a characteristic energy scale given by @xmath1.@xcite at equilibrium , the kondo temperature @xmath2 depends on the parameters of the system , i.e. , the coupling of the dot to the external leads due to tunneling , the dot onsite repulsion ( charging energy ) and the position of the resonant level relative to the fermi energy @xmath3 .",
    "all of them can be tuned in a controlled way.@xcite    in a quantum dot with a sufficiently large charging energy ( @xmath4 ) and a single energy level well below @xmath3 , the dynamics of the quasilocalized electron becomes almost frozen .",
    "therefore , a quantum dot can be viewed as an artificial realization ( at the nanoscale ) of a magnetic impurity with spin @xmath5 . at very low temperatures ( @xmath6 ) , charge fluctuations in the dot",
    "are suppressed and there arises an effective antiferromagnetic interaction between the electrons of the reservoir and the @xmath5 localized moment . remarkably , the measured conductance reaches the maximum value for a quantum channel ( @xmath7 ) and the dot appears to be perfectly transparent when a small voltage @xmath8 is applied between the source and the drain contacts .",
    "nevertheless , the coherent correlated motion of the delocalized electrons forming the kondo cloud can be disturbed when either the bias voltage or the temperature are of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "in such a case , the many - body wave function of the kondo state is expected to suffer from _ dephasing _ , leading to a decrease in the conductance .",
    "this issue has recently attracted a lot of attention@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we mimic in a phenomenological way the effect of dephasing on the transport properties of a two - terminal quantum dot in the kondo regime by introducing a _ fictitious _ voltage probe .",
    "now , in the absence of dephasing , the building block of the kondo resonance is a narrow peak ( of width @xmath9 ) around @xmath3 in the local density of states ( ldos ) of the dot .",
    "however , full quantum - dot spectroscopy of the ldos _ can not _ be accomplished with a two - terminal transport setup . in particular",
    ", one can not gain experimental access to the predicted large voltage induced splitting of the ldos when @xmath10.@xcite a way to circumvent this problem is by attaching a third lead , as demonstrated independently by sun and guo@xcite and lebanon and schiller.@xcite in subsequent laboratory work , de franceschi _ et al._@xcite observed a split kondo resonance by employing a slightly modified technique ",
    "one of the leads was replaced by a narrow wire driven out of equilibrium where left and right moving carriers have different electrochemical potentials .    motivated in part by the works cited in the preceding paragraph ,",
    "we are concerned in this paper as well with the nonequilibrium kondo physics and the fluctuations of the current through a quantum dot attached to three leads .",
    "as is well known , the investigation of the current - current correlations in mesoscopic conductors has been a fruitful area of research.@xcite nevertheless , there are still very scarce applications to strongly correlated systems as the shot noise is a purely _ nonequilibrium _ property , and thus more difficult to treat .",

    "that is the reason why we next consider the shot noise in lead 1 @xmath157 , which is an even function of the applied @xmath127 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig45](b ) we plot the results of eq .",
    "( [ ccc4 ] ) . we observe that @xmath157 at @xmath128 is nonvanishing with increasing @xmath151 , causing a _ divergence _ of the fano factor .",
    "this is not related to the kondo physics but with the fact that the lead 1 at @xmath128 acts as a voltage probe with _",
    "zero _ impedance since the net current flowing through it is zero .",
    "including the fluctuations of the potentials would probably cancel out the divergence .",
    "a consequence of kondo physics is that the minimum at @xmath128 turns into a maximum .",
    "this occurs when the splitting in @xmath126 is sharply formed [ see fig.[fig4 ] ] .",
    "so far we have assumed spin - independent transport .",
    "let us go back to the bias configuration of secs .",
    "[ sec_mc ] and  [ sec_cc ] ( @xmath158 ) and focus on the spin - dependent transport properties .",
    "it is customary in the theoretical studies of spintronic transport to take into account the influence of external magnetic fields and ferromagnetic electrodes , among other parameters.@xcite firstly , we shall change the external zeeman field and then enable the presence of spin - polarized tunneling .",
    "we assume that the leads are paramagnetic and that the magnetic field is applied only to the dot , resulting in a zeeman gap of the bare resonant level : @xmath68 .",
    "it is well known that , as a consequence , the kondo resonance is split when @xmath159.@xcite    figure  [ fig5](a ) shows the differential conductance @xmath147 for different values of the zeeman field .",
    "the conductance is split and quenched with increasing @xmath160 , as expected . in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , we depict the fano factor of the cross correlator @xmath140 .",
    "it exhibits a very interesting feature .",
    "due to the splitting of the kondo peak , the minimum of the cross correlator at @xmath128 becomes a local maximum , resulting from the suppression of the kondo effect .",
    "however , this change occurs _ before _ the splitting of the conductance @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , measuring the shot noise provides _ new _ information in this case .",
    "the presence of the splitting would be detected in an experiment more precisely by means of the shot noise .",
    "the underlying reason is that the form of eq .",
    "( [ ccc3 ] ) differs from that of the current which is basically proportional to @xmath161 alone , see eq .",
    "( [ cur2 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the width of the @xmath147 resonance is a bit larger than the @xmath140 antiresonance and the former is then more robust than the latter against the application of magnetic fields .",
    "there has recently been considerable debate about the influence of ferromagnetic leads in the kondo physics of a quantum dot.@xcite in the preceding subsection , it was clear that an external magnetic field alters the real part of the quantum - dot self - energy , breaking the spin degeneracy . in the case of spin polarized tunneling ,",
    "the situation is more subtle.@xcite when the magnetic moments of the contacts are aligned along the same direction , the density of states of the localized electron undergoes a splitting if particle - hole symmetry is broken.@xcite recent transport experiments with c@xmath162 molecules and carbon nanotubes have addressed this regime.@xcite however , in our case the dot is in the strong coupling limit and the kondo effect is pure in the sense that no charge fluctuations are allowed .",
    "thus , no splitting is expected in the differential conductance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , we show the cross correlator @xmath163 for different values of the lead magnetization in the parallel case .",
    "this means that @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the spin polarization of lead @xmath29 .",
    "ferromagnetism in the leads arises through spin - dependent densities of states @xmath166 .",
    "hence , the linewidths become spin dependent : @xmath167 , where + ( - ) corresponds to up ( down ) spins .",
    "we prefer to restrict @xmath165 to small values as strong magnetizations would require a proper treatment of the reduction of the bandwidth @xmath54 .",
    "we observe that @xmath163 is rather insensitive to changes in @xmath13 in the same fashion as @xmath126 is in the fermi - liquid fixed point@xcite . only at moderate polarizations ( @xmath168 )",
    "we see that the dip in @xmath163 gets narrower because the kondo temperature decreases as @xmath13 increases@xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath163 is always negative in contrast to the results obtained in the coulomb blockade regime where @xmath163 can take positive values  @xcite .",
    "when the spin - flip scattering rate is smaller than the tunneling rate , @xmath163 can be positive .",
    "however in the kondo regime this condition is never met since the rate of spin flip scattering @xmath169 is always much longer than the tunneling rate @xmath170 .",
    "figure  [ fig6](b ) is devoted to the antiparallel case : @xmath171 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath163 is lifted with increasing lead polarization since the conductance peak decreases with increasing @xmath13 ( roughly , with a factor @xmath172 )  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the kondo temperature , the differential conductance and cross correlations of the current when three leads are coupled to an artificial kondo impurity in the fermi - liquid fixed point of the infinite-@xmath173 anderson hamiltonian ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the properties of the cross correlators when dc bias , zeeman splittings , and ferromagnetic leads influence the nonequilibrium transport through the quantum dot .",
    "our most relevant result is the behavior of the shot noise when there arises a voltage induced splitting in the quantum dot .",
    "in addition , we have studied the current of a two - terminal quantum dot attached to a voltage probe .",
    "we have shown that increasing the coupling with the probe induces a quenching of the kondo peak . despite the simplicity of this approach",
    ", it gives rise to results that are in agreement with more sophisticated models,@xcite though the precise processes responsible for the decoherence need still to be derived from a microscopic model .",
    "we have not exhausted all the possibilities that the model offers and more complicated geometries with appealing results can be envisaged .",
    "one could address the situation with two injecting and two receiving leads , which could give rise to hanbury brown - twiss - like effects.@xcite we expect that phase related exchange terms will arise especially at higher temperatures ( @xmath11 ) , when the singlet state between the localized spin and the conduction electrons is not yet well formed .",
    "we believe that in the presence of spin - polarized couplings due to ferromagnetic leads , bunching effects will be enhanced.@xcite    improvements of the model should go in the direction of including fluctuations of the boson field and of the renormalized level .",
    "however , we do not expect large deviations from the results reported here when @xmath43 .",
    "these fluctuations will evidently become important as temperature approaches @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally , our predictions can be tested with present technology such as gaas quantum dots@xcite or carbon - nanotube nanostructures.@xcite",
