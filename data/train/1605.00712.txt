    ", we have found that while migrating , clusters adopt a shape that is ( i ) elongated in the gradient direction and ( ii ) non - convex ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : heat]a ) .",
    "both features lead to a cluster perimeter - to - area ratio that is significantly larger than that expected for a circle or other convex shape with aspect ratio near unity .",
    "importantly , we have found that the area and perimeter scalings remain predictive of mfpt in the communication - limited regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results]d ) , even with the observed non - circular and fluctuating geometries .    to the extent",
    "possible , our model has been constructed and parameterized using current experiments on collective migration .",
    "intercellular communication is modeled as a direct exchange of messenger molecules between cells since this type of communication has been implicated in development , organoid branching , angiogenesis , and cancer @xcite .",
    "the chemical concentration and gradient values are selected to ensure that our simulations are in the shallow gradient regime , where experiments show that collectives can respond whereas single cells can not @xcite .",
    "cell size , chemical concentration , chemical gradient , cell - cell contact energy , and cell - ecm contact energy values are taken from previous experimental studies of collective cell behavior ( table [ table : param ] ) .",
    "how do our model predictions compare to experiments ?",
    "there have been many studies on collective migration @xcite though only one ( to our knowledge ) , by malet - engra et al .",
    "@xcite , measures migratory properties as a function of cluster size .",
    "the experiments conducted by malet - engra et al .  reveal that beyond a minimum cluster size , the cluster velocity saturates to a maximal value and then remains constant with increasing cluster size . in our study",
    ", we find that when communication is strong , the mfpt  which is inversely related to the mean velocity  also saturates to a minimal value and remains constant for a large range of cluster sizes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results]a ( red curve ) , as the cluster size increases from about 30 to 200 cells the mfpt remains relatively constant , in qualitative agreement with the aforementioned experimental results .",
    "this saturation regime occurs when communication is sufficiently strong to suppress , over a large range of cluster sizes , the drag - induced slowdown",
    ". our findings thus suggest that sensory information is reliably transferred throughout the clusters of lymphocytes studied by malet - engra et al . , and that communication is strong enough that drag does not strongly constrain migration speed for the cluster sizes analyzed .",
    "furthermore , our results suggest a simple experimental test that can distinguish whether cluster chemotaxis is purely collective or individually driven .",
    "broadly speaking , cluster migration ( i ) can emerge collectively from cells that communicate , either chemically or mechanically , but do not chemotax alone ( as in our model ) , or ( ii ) it can result from many individual agents that take independent measurements of the environment and through physical coupling or local interactions produce collective migration @xcite ( a so - called `` many wrongs '' mechanism @xcite ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpt]a , our results suggest that in the former case , one would observe a minimum in the migration time as a function of the cluster size , with the optimal size determined by the length scale of collective information processing within the cluster .",
    "in contrast , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpt]b , in the latter case migration is driven by the integrated measurements of many effectively independent agents , and thus one would observe a monotonic decrease in the migration time as a function of the cluster size @xcite .",
    "distinguishing the dependence in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpt]a from that in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfpt]b using microscopy would provide phenomenological evidence of purely collective chemotaxis without relying on molecular - level details",
    ".    an important feature of our model and its analysis is that the timescale of sensing is faster than the timescale of cell response and motility ( table [ table : param ] ) .",
    "however , in actuality the duration of cells sensing timescales relative to their response timescales is unknown @xcite . if the motility timescale is shorter than that of sensing for a specific cell type than the mfpt dependence on cluster size may be more complicated than predicted .",
    "for short response timescales we expect migratory behavior to be more strongly diffusive , but to still remain biased in the direction of the gradient over periods of time larger than the sensing timescale .    in our model , the precision of multicellular migration is determined in part by noise arising from ligand diffusion at the initial sensory stage . as such",
    ", the model respects the fundamental limits to the precision of collective gradient sensing set by the physics of diffusion , which were recently tested in collectives of epithelial cells @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see how these and similar limits translate from the domain of sensing to that of migration , and whether they depend on the underlying migration mechanism ( purely collective , individually driven , or a mixture thereof ) .",
