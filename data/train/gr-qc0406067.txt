    "some of them , confined by the horizon , are captured by the collapse and reach the singularity , and others scape to @xmath95 . any initial condition obeying @xmath96 leads to the same causal structure .",
    "the proposed semi - analytical procedure can be used also to derive some qualitative results .",

    ", one could construct the conformal diagram corresponding to the mass function @xmath108 starting from the last example .",
    "such a case , however , does not correspond really to an evaporating black hole since , according to this mass function , the black hole never disappears , the singularity at @xmath35 is ever present for @xmath109 . in a real process of black hole evaporation due to hawking radiation ,",

    "the resulting conformal diagram represents a black hole that evaporates leaving behind a naked singularity .",
    "we presented a semi - analytical approach to construct the vaidya metric in double - null coordinates for general monotonic mass functions .",
    "we applied it to elucidate the nature of the three distinct qualitative causal structures identified by waugh and lake@xcite for linear mass functions , to construct a solution corresponding to a smooth radial collapse of a null fluid , starting from empty space and finishing with a black - hole , and to construct the conformal diagram of a evaporating black hole .",
    "the approach involves an arbitrary function @xmath41 . however , any choice for which @xmath62 will result in causally equivalent regular ( @xmath114 ) space - times .",
    "the analytical solutions of this problem also involve an arbitrary function , as @xmath31 in ( [ l ] ) , that must be chosen properly in order to get a regular spacetime .",
