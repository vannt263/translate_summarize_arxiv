    "type iib , ib and ic supernovae ( sne  iib , ib , ic ) , also referred to as stripped - envelope supernovae ( se - sne ) , show a large diversity in observed properties .",
    "they are distinguished from the majority of all core - collapse events ( type iip sne ) by less persistent or absent hydrogen lines in their early spectra and the lack of a plateau phase in their light curves .",
    "sne  iib represent a transition between hydrogen - dominated sne  iip and mostly hydrogen - free , helium - dominated sne  ib .",
    "they are therefore particularly interesting to clarify the evolutionary path of se - sn progenitors",
    ". however , sne iib are relatively rare . only few",
    "have been observed up to now , and little is known about their spread in mass and energy .",
    "the subdivision of sne into type iib and type ib is not uncompromising , as it depends strongly on the hydrogen mass and distribution , and on the phase at which the supernova was discovered .",
    "recent studies have suggested that there may be traces of hydrogen in all sn  ib spectra , and of both hydrogen and helium even in sne  ic @xcite .    despite the increasing interest in se - sne due to their link to long - duration @xmath4-ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and x - ray flashes ( @xcite ; but see also e.g. @xcite ) , their diversity has not yet been fully understood .",
    "new observations , like the first detection of a very energetic type iib hypernova ( sn  2003bg ; @xcite ) , rather indicate more diversity than previously thought . at present , possible progenitor scenarios include massive stars in close binary systems experiencing strong mass transfer , very massive single stars with strong stellar winds @xcite , or a combination of these two processes .",
    "so far , it has not been possible to discriminate between these scenarios by direct progenitor detections .",
    "sn  2008ax provides a rare opportunity to add detailed observations of a sn of this class .",
    "it is one of few cases discovered soon after explosion , with the progenitor detected in hst images @xcite . from x - ray to radio wavelengths , it is the best - monitored sn  iib after the very nearby sn  1993j ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "follow - up observations of sn  2008ax started soon after discovery .",
    "the sn site had been monitored by @xcite on ut march 3.19 , and no source had been detected down to a limiting magnitude of 18.5 .",
    "this detection limit allowed ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p08 ) to constrain the explosion time to be ut march 3.30 , with a small uncertainty of 0.15 days ( jd = @xmath9 ) .",
    "early x - ray , uv , optical and radio observations of sn  2008ax were presented by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter r09 ) , and densely sampled optical photometry was published by p08 and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ts09 ) .",

    "three epochs of optical spectropolarimetry were analysed by ch10 , and reveal strong line polarisation , especially across the hydrogen lines , shortly after the explosion .",
    "23 ghz very - long - baseline - interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of sn  2008ax , made 33 days after the explosion with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) by @xcite , resulted in a marginal detection of the supernova .",
    "a total flux density of @xmath10 mjy was measured , and the structure was interpreted as either a core - jet or a double source",
    ". a progenitor mass - loss rate of @xmath11yr@xmath12 was inferred by r09 based on x - ray data .",
    "ch10 estimated @xmath13yr@xmath12 by the lack of narrow emission lines in a moderate - resolution early - time spectrum , in good agreement with the r09 result .",
    "r09 detected an initial fading in the uv light curves of sn  2008ax , interpreted as a fingerprint of adiabatic cooling after shock breakout . with this paper",
