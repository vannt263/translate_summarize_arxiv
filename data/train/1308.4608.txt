    "we investigate the correspondence between topological field theories and quantum integrable systems , discovered by moore , nekrasov and shatashvili @xcite .",
    "they applied the cohomological localization method to the topological yang - mills - higgs model and then discovered that its localized configurations coincide with the bethe ansatz equations in the non - linear schr@xmath3dinger model .",
    "later , gerasimov and shatashvili revealed that the partition function of the topological yang - mills - higgs model is related to the norms of the wave functions in the non - linear shcr@xmath3dinger model @xcite .",
    "from this fact , the topological yang - mills - higgs model corresponds to the non - linear schr@xmath3dinger model .",
    "we call the correspondence like this as the gauge / bethe correspondence through this paper .",
    "this correspondence implies that a special topological gauge theory has a hidden quantum integrable structure .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we showed a correspondence between the @xmath4 gauged wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model on a genus-@xmath5 riemann surface @xmath6 and the phase model , which is a quantum integrable field theory on a one - dimensional lattice and a strongly correlated boson system , first introduced by @xcite .",
    "in particular , we showed that its localized configurations and the partition function coincide with the bethe ansatz equations and a summation of all the norms between the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the phase model , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4 gauged wzw model is equivalent to the chern - simons theory with the gauge group @xmath7 on @xmath8 because the partition function of the @xmath4 gauged wzw model coincides with that of the chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , we found that the chern - simons theory on @xmath9 also corresponds to the phase model .",
    "the gauge / bethe correspondence is realized for not only topological gauge theories but also vacua in a supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "nekrasov and shatashvili discovered that coulomb branch in a supersymmetric gauge theory corresponds to a certain integrable system .",
    "for example , they found that the effective twisted superpotential in an @xmath10 supersymmetric gauge theory in two dimensions coincides with the yang - yang function for the xxx model @xcite .",
    "this correspondence is deeply related to the gauge / bethe correspondence between topological field theories and quantum integrable systems .",
    "this is natural because the vacua of the supersymmetric gauge theory transfer to physical states in the topological field theory through a topological twist . although it is known that various supersymmetric or topological gauge theories correspond to certain quantum integrable systems , the underlying mathematical principle of the gauge / bethe correspondence is not clear up to now .",
    "our purpose is to construct a one - parameter deformation of the gauge / bethe correspondence between the @xmath4 gauged wzw model and the phase model , and to investigate the underlying mathematical principle of the gauge / bethe correspondence in our case .",
    "it is known that the phase model can be realized by the strong coupling limit of the @xmath0-boson model , a quantum integrable field theory on a one - dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath0-boson model can be regarded as the one - parameter deformation of the phase model . from the viewpoint of the gauge / bethe correspondence",
    ", we expect that there exists a one - parameter deformation of the @xmath4 gauged wzw model corresponding to the @xmath0-boson model .",
    "such a model actually exists and is the @xmath4 gauged wzw model coupled to additional scalar matters .",
    "we call this model as the @xmath4 gauged wzw - matter model",

    "in particular , it is well known that the category of commutative frobenius algebras is categorical equivalent to that of two dimensional tqfts , e.g. @xcite . recently , korff constructed a new commutative frobenius algebra from the @xmath0-boson model @xcite as a one - parameter deformation of the verlinde algebra in the wess - zumino - witten model constructed from the phase model @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to think that there exists a relation between the @xmath11 gauged wzw - matter model and the tqft equivalent to this commutative frobenius algebra , as with the relation between the @xmath11 gauged wzw model and the verlinde algebra @xcite",

    "we show the correspondence between the correlation functions of gauge invariant brst - closed operators in the @xmath11 gauged wzw - matter model and the expectation values of conserved charges in the @xmath0-boson model .",

    ", we define the hamiltonian of the @xmath0-boson model which belongs to @xmath36 and acts on @xmath38 .",

    "in order to understand the properties of the @xmath0-boson model , we consider relations between the @xmath0-boson algebra ( [ q - boson algebra tensor ] ) and the harmonic oscillator algebra @xmath45 = - a_i \\delta_{i j},\\quad [ \\hat{n}_i , a^{\\dagger}_j ] = a^{\\dagger}_i \\delta_{i j},\\quad [ a_i , a^{\\dagger}_j ] = \\delta_{i j}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the operators obeying the @xmath0-boson algebra are represented by the operators @xmath46 obeying the harmonic oscillator algebra as follows : @xmath47 where these are defined as a formal power series .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ q - boson hamiltonian ] ) by using the substitution ( [ substitution q - boson ] ) as @xmath48 here , @xmath0 serves as a coupling constant of the @xmath0-boson model .",
    "when we expand the hamiltonian in terms of the coupling constant , infinite interaction terms appear in front of the hopping term .",

    "the @xmath0-boson model becomes the phase model in the strong coupling limit @xmath53 .",
    "there also exists a continuum limit because the @xmath0-boson model is a field theory on the lattice . in this limit",

    "therefore , the @xmath0-boson model is a quantum integrable system .    from now on , let us construct the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the transfer matrix .",

    "in order to do this , we define @xcite @xmath396 if @xmath397 is the solution of the bethe ansatz equations ( [ bethe equation ] ) , @xmath398 satisfies @xmath399 by using these relations , we rewrite the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix as follows : @xmath400 then , we obtain the following expression for the eigenvalues of the conserved charges : @xmath401 moreover , we rewrite @xmath398 as , ( [ q and power ] ) becomes a relation between a complete symmetric polynomial and power sums : @xmath402 ] @xmath403 where a power sum with partition @xmath337 is defined by @xmath404 and @xmath405 is defined by as @xmath406 in ( [ z def ] ) . for example , @xmath407 ] @xmath408 then , we find that the eigenvalue of the conserved charges is expressed by the power sums with partitions by utilizing this relation as @xmath409 therefore , we obtain @xmath410    from now on , let us show the correspondence between the one - point functions in the @xmath11 gauged wzw - matter model and the expectation values of the conserved charges in the @xmath0-boson model .",
    "we first identify the level @xmath14 , the dual coxeter number @xmath13 of @xmath411 , the coupling constant @xmath303 and the cartan part @xmath223 of the field @xmath311 in the @xmath11 gauged wzw - matter model with the total site number @xmath34 , the total particle number @xmath104 , the coupling constant @xmath304 and the bethe roots @xmath312 in the @xmath0-boson model , respectively , as with the partition function .",
    "then , the one - point function can be expressed by the norms between the eigenstates in the @xmath0-boson model as follows : @xmath412 we define special operators as @xmath413 where @xmath414 is a partition and @xmath405 is defined in ( [ z def ] ) .",
    "then , we find that the one - point function of this operator is given by @xmath415 where we have used ( [ expectation values of conserved charge ] ) .    as a result , we have clarified the relations between the one - point functions of the special operators in the @xmath11 gauged wzw - matter model and the expectation values of the conserved charges in the @xmath0-boson model .",
    "this also implies that the special operators @xmath416 in the gauged wzw - matter model formally correspond to the conserved charges in the @xmath0-boson model .",
    "the generalization to the @xmath236-point functions of @xmath417 is straightforward .",
    "the @xmath236-point functions are given by @xmath418 consequently , we find that the gauge / bethe correspondence works well for not only the partition function but also the correlation functions in the topological gauge theory .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a one - parameter deformation of the @xmath4 gauged wzw model by coupling it to brst - exact matters and evaluated its partition function in the case of @xmath419 and @xmath167 .",
    "we have shown that the localized field configurations in the path integral coincide with the bethe ansatz equations for the @xmath0-boson model and that the partition function is represented by a summation of the norms between the eigenstates in the @xmath0-boson model .",
    "thus , we have established the correspondence between the @xmath15 or @xmath11 gauged wzw - matter model and the @xmath0-boson model , which is a new example of the gauge / bethe correspondence .",
    "this correspondence is a one - parameter deformation of  gauged wzw model / phase model correspondence \" @xcite .",
    "we also have evaluated numerically the partition function and have given the explicit forms as the function of a deformation parameter @xmath96 in several cases .",
    "this conjectured form of the partition function can be reproduced from the viewpoint of the axiom of the topological quantum field theory .",
    "then , we have shown that the @xmath11 gauged wzw - matter model is a lagrangian realization of a topological quantum field theory constructed by korff @xcite .",
    "this implies that the gauge / bethe correspondence is realized only if one constructs a commutative frobenius algebra from a certain integrable system , as with @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the gauge / bethe correspondence works well .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the correlation functions can also be expressed by the language of the @xmath0-boson model .",
    "this is the correspondence for the quantity of a new type in the gauge / bethe correspondence .",
    "we comment on several future directions .",
    "we are interested in whether the @xmath4 gauged wzw - matter model maintains similar properties with the @xmath4 gauged wzw model .",
    "first , we are interested in the chern - simons theory related to the @xmath4 gauged wzw - matter model .",
    "it is well known that the partition function of the @xmath4 gauged wzw model on @xmath6 coincides with that of the chern - simons theory with a gauge group @xmath7 on @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that there exists the three dimensional counterpart of the @xmath4 gauged wzw - matter model . since the gauged wzw - matter model possesses the scalar brst charge which is crucial to carry out localization , the three dimensional counterpart should possess this property .",
    "a natural candidate with a scalar brst charge is a ( topologically ) twisted supersymmetric chern - simons - matter theory on @xmath8 .",
    "for example , a twisted chern - simons - matter theory on seifert manifolds are constructed in @xcite .",
    "when we consider the chern - simons theory coupled to an adjoint twisted matter with a real mass @xmath420 , the one - loop determinant for this theory will coincide with ( [ 1-loop cs ] ) under the identification @xmath421 .",
    "it also is interesting to study a correspondence between the gauged wzw - matter model and a twisted chern - simons - matter theory in detail .",
    "secondly , it is known that the partition function of the @xmath4 gauged wzw model coincides with a geometric index over the moduli space @xmath422 of the stable holomorphic @xmath423-bundles on a riemann surface @xcite : @xmath424 in the large level limit , the partition function is asymptotic to the volume of the moduli space of a flat connection @xcite ,- bundles on a riemann surface . ] and the action therefore reduces to that of the bf - theory whose partition function gives the volume of the moduli space of flat connection @xcite .",
    "how about the case of the @xmath4 gauged wzw - matter model ?",
    "in the large level limit , the partition function of the bf - theory coupled to adjoint matters is interpreted as the volume of a moduli space @xmath425 d \\mu=0,\\ , { \\partial}_{a } \\phi=0 , \\ , \\bar{\\partial}_{a } \\phi^{\\dagger}=0 \\bigr\\ } / \\mathcal{g } \\label{moduliymh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath426 is the gauge transformation group of @xmath7 .",
    "we conjecture that the partition function of the @xmath4 gauged wzw - matter model is related to a certain geometric index over the moduli space @xmath427 .",
    "thus , the integrality of the partition function may be interpreted as the dimensions of cohomologies .",
    "if @xmath140 is not a section of @xmath428 but a element of @xmath429 , ( [ moduliymh ] ) is the moduli space of the hitchin s equation or the higgs bundle @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there exists a index over the moduli space of the higgs bundle for a one - parameter deformation of ( [ indexflat ] ) .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "in this case , the deformation parameter is the parameter of the power series of bundles over the moduli space . in their calculation",
    ", the index is expressed by the summation over the solutions of nonlinear equations like the localized equations of our model .",
    "for example , see ( 4,2 ) in @xcite for @xmath430",
    ". it will be interesting to give the interpretation for the partition function of our model in term of a geometric index over @xmath427 .",
