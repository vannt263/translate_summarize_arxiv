    "when a semiconductor is optically excited above the band gap , the carriers relax to the band edges by emitting a cascade of optical phonons on a picosecond timescale ; the resulting nonequilibrium phonon population then relaxes by anharmonic processes over a few picoseconds.@xcite time - resolved spectroscopy played an essential role in characterizing this process,@xcite and it is now being applied successfully in research on more complex solids.@xcite the optical excitations of insulating magnetic oxides are an important frontier of this research .",
    "understanding the elementary excitation spectrum of magnetic insulators has been a central concern in condensed matter physics for over half a century , and there is widespread consensus that high - temperature superconductivity is intimately related to the physics of the insulating , antiferromagnetic copper oxide plane.@xcite the optical gap in lamellar insulating cuprates is associated with the transfer of an electron from an oxygen ion to a neighboring copper ion within the copper oxide plane.@xcite the electron resides primarily on the copper in a nominal @xmath0 state , while the oxygen hole forms a zhang - rice singlet with another neighboring copper in a @xmath1 state.@xcite beyond this basic picture , however , there continues to be controversy around the role played by interactions of the electron and hole with each other , with magnetic excitations , and with phonons .",
    "the properties of the hole states in copper oxides have been extensively studied with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite the hole bandwidth was measured to be @xmath2  mev , strongly renormalized from the band theoretic value and consistent with the @xmath3 prediction of the @xmath4 model , although an extension to a @xmath5 model is required to fit the detailed dispersion.@xcite the photoemission lineshape was observed to be unusually broad , and recent work has interpreted this as franck - condon broadening due to phonons that modulate the electronic and magnetic interactions through the cu - o bond.@xcite    the importance of carrier - phonon interactions to the optical properties of insulating cuprates were recognized by @xcite they showed that the energy and linewidth of the gap excitation have an anomalously strong temperature dependence , and explained this with a model involving short - range electron - hole interactions together with carrier - phonon interactions.@xcite this behavior has since been explained alternately as the result of lattice expansion@xcite or electron - magnon interactions,@xcite and currently the relative importance of these effects remains unresolved .",
    "carrier - phonon interactions were further implicated in a study of the urbach tail.@xcite    time - resolved optical studies in insulating cuprates have also provided evidence for strong coupling of carriers to phonons and magnons at lower energies , and recent work on photoinduced phase transitions have exploited this feature to produce metastably ordered states that would be impossible to create in thermal equilibrium.@xcite picosecond resonant raman spectroscopy on insulating yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 indicated that photoexcited carriers release excess energy to optical phonons in less than one picosecond.@xcite the photoexcited states in insulating yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 and nd@xmath6cuo@xmath9 have also been studied with transient absorption spectroscopy.@xcite in that case , an observed sub - picosecond initial relaxation time was interpreted to be the rate at which photoexcited states give off energy to magnons .    in this work",

    "the photoinduced absorption spectrum mimics the effect of raising temperature , indicating that photoexcitation induces the same bosonic excitations that are excited thermally . by relating the pump - probe signal amplitude to the amplitude of the thermal difference spectrum",
    "we can infer that for every 3  ev photon absorbed , eleven to twenty low - energy bosons are emitted by the photoexcited state . for relaxation to the optical absorption edge at 1.5  ev , this corresponds to 70130  mev per boson .",

    "in conventional semiconductors the inelastic electron - phonon scattering rate can be derived perturbatively from the frlich model ; in two dimensions , @xmath55.@xcite while is expected to be in the strong coupling limit , extending this perturbative result gives a crude estimate of @xmath56 .",
    "the cascade following a 3  ev excitation could then generate 33 phonons as it relaxes to the gap edge at 1.5  ev , a process that would take about 33  fs to complete .",

    "if the carriers relax completely to the gap edge at 1.5  ev , this implies an average energy per boson of 130  mev , much larger than the 45  mev we assumed for the optical phonon energy .",
    "alternatively , if we match the photoinduced absorption and thermal difference spectra at the peak near @xmath67  ev instead of at the dip near @xmath68  ev , we get @xmath69 and an average boson energy of 76  mev , comparable to the highest energy optical phonons in .@xcite taking these as limiting cases , we get @xmath70  1120 .",
    "this comparison suggests that magnetic excitations may play a role in relaxing the energy of the photoexcited state while contributing little to the pump - probe spectrum .",
    "one possible relaxation product is the resonant excitation of two magnons and one phonon , which would absorb 350  mev of energy but create only one phonon.@xcite in this model , the average energy per boson can then be taken as a measure of the branching ratio between phonon relaxation and magnon relaxation . taking the lower limit for @xmath71 , a 3  ev optical excitation will release about 0.5  ev to phonons and 1.0  ev to magnetic excitations .",
    "we note an additional weak photoinduced absorption feature at @xmath72 that we assign to the @xmath73 ligand - field exciton.@xcite this excitation is parity forbidden and appears as a weak shoulder extending from 1.4 - 1.7  ev in linear optical absorption measurements.@xcite it is evident in both linear absorption and in our pump - probe measurements at low temperatures only .",

    "an equivalent sum rule can be written for the absorption coefficient @xmath20 that is more convenient here : @xmath77 these expressions indicate that the total frequency - dependent conductivity and absorption is conserved , so that any increase at one frequency must be compensated by a decrease elsewhere . in cuprates ,",
    "increasing the carrier density causes spectral weight to be shifted from the charge - transfer gap to free - carrier conductivity at lower frequencies .",
    "photoinduced bleaching is well understood in semiconductor optics .",
    "it results from pauli blocking , when photoexcited states occupy phase space that are then prevented by the pauli exclusion principle from further population .",
    "to quantitatively assess the strength of the phase - space filling it is useful to calculate the real - space area that a photoexcited state excludes from further absorption@xcite to determine this for a 3  ev excitation in , we extract the amount of photobleaching @xmath78 \\approx 230~\\text{ev\\,cm}^{-1}$ ] in the pump - probe response at @xmath30 and normalize it by the total linear absorption @xmath79 over the same spectral range to get a fractional absorption of @xmath80 . dividing this by the excitation density @xmath33 gives excluded area of 9.3 copper oxide plaquettes .",
