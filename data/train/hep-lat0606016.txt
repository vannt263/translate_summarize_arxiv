    "recently there has been renewed interest in studying the distribution of quark and gluon fields in the three - quark static - baryon system .",
    "while the earliest studies were inconclusive @xcite , improved computing resources and analysis techniques now make it possible to study this system in a quantitative manner @xcite . in particular , it is possible to directly compute the gluon field distribution @xcite using lattice qcd techniques similar to those pioneered in mesonic static - quark systems @xcite .    similar to okiharu and woloshyn @xcite , our first interest is to test the static - quark source - shape dependence of the observed flux distribution , as represented by correlations between the quark positions and the action or topological charge density of the gauge fields . to this end",
    ", we choose three different ways of connecting the gauge link paths required to create gauge - invariant wilson loops as in our preliminary study @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "quarks are connected along a t - shape path , while in the second case an l - shape is considered .",
    "finally symmetric link paths approximating a y - shape such that the quark positions approximate the vertices of an equilateral triangle are considered .",
    "the latter is particularly interesting as the probability of observing a @xmath2-shape flux - tube ( empty triangle ) distribution is maximised in this equidistant case .",
    "the most recent lattice qcd studies are in favor of the y ansatz when it comes to the confinement potential @xcite at long distances @xcite and flux tube formation @xcite .",
    "we also note that a theoretical calculation using center - vortex qcd with gauge group @xmath7 also favors the y ansatz @xcite . in order to better compare t and y shapes we study configurations in which the quarks are in the same location and only the connection point changes .",
    "such a direct comparison is not possible with the l - shape .    because the signal decreases in an exponential fashion with the size of the loop , it is essential to use a method to enhance overlap with the ground state of interest .",
    "we use strict three - dimensional ape smearing @xcite to enhance the overlap of our spatial - link paths with the ground - state static - quark baryon potential .",
    "time - oriented links remain untouched to preserve the correct static quark potential at all separations .",
    "we present results for two levels of source smearing including a minimal smearing of 10 ape steps and an optimal smearing of 30 ape steps .",

    "while these sources provide information vital to linking the flux - tube distribution to the static quark potential , they are not adequate to isolate the ground - state potential at large quark separations . therefore in sec .",

    "to study the flux distribution in baryons on the lattice , one begins with the standard approach of connecting static quark propagators by spatial - link paths in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "ape - smeared spatial - link paths propagate the quarks from a common origin to their spatial positions as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ staple ] .",
    "the static quark propagators are constructed from time directed link products at fixed spatial coordinate , @xmath8 , using the untouched `` thin '' links of the gauge configuration .",
    "the smearing procedure replaces a spatial link , @xmath9 , with a sum of @xmath10 times the original link plus @xmath11 times its four spatially oriented staples , followed by projection back to @xmath7 .",
    "we select the special - unitary matrix @xmath12 which maximises @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the smeared link , by iterating over the three diagonal @xmath15 subgroups of @xmath7 repeatedly . in practice ,",
    "eight iterations over the three subgroups optimizes the projected link to about 1 part in @xmath16 .",
    "we initially repeated the combined procedure of smearing and projection @xmath17 times , with @xmath18 .",
    "however , it will become clear that @xmath17 times is not enough to isolate the ground state of the three - quark static - quark potential at large quark separations .",
    "we have found that repeating the smearing - projection procedure @xmath19 times is effective in isolating the ground - state . in this case",
    "the string - tension of the three - quark potential matches that of the quark - antiquark potential .",
    "we will present for comparison , results for both @xmath17 and @xmath19 steps of ape - source smearing .",
    "untouched links in the time direction propagate the spatially separated quarks through euclidean time . in principle , the ground state is isolated after sufficient time evolution .",
    "finally smeared - link spatial paths propagate the quarks back to the common spatial origin .",
    "the three - quark wilson loop is defined as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a staple made of path - ordered link variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the path along a given staple as shown in fig .",

    "figures [ tpath ] and [ lpath ] give the projection of t and l shape paths in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane . figure [ ypath ] shows the paths considered in constructing the y - shape . in all cases the three quarks are created at the origin , @xmath34 ( white bubble ) , then are propagated to the positions @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 ( black circle ) before being propagated through time and finally back to a sink at the same spatial location as the source ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 boxes are the average of the two path - ordered link variables going from one corner to the diagonally opposite one . taking both of these paths",

    "we also consider @xmath40 boxes which are the averages of the possible paths connecting two opposite corners using @xmath41 and @xmath42 boxes .",
    "we may create further link paths in the future for use in bigger loops if it becomes necessary .",

    "this value is 24(9)% larger than the flux - tube radius of @xmath65 fm .",
    "in addition , we observe a 15(3)% increase in the amplitude of vacuum - action expulsion , @xmath66 , in the node of the flux - tube relative to the expulsion observed in the flux tube itself , for the seventh quark separation .",
    "the amplitude of the relative action expulsion in the node is reasonably uniform for the various quark separations at @xmath67 . here",
    "the uncertainty reflects statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with the data cuts and various quark separations .    .",

    "table  [ nodes - fit ] shows the node is very close to the origin defined at the node of the source .",
    "the movement of the observed node position to the left is consistent with movement towards the location of the fermat point . in this case",
    "the fermat point is located at @xmath71 and @xmath69 for cut i is in agreement with this value .    on a final note",
    ", we explore the euclidean time evolution of our results for the 30-sweep smeared y - shape source , which we have established to access the ground state potential in a quantitative manner . the early plateau behavior displayed in the top plot of fig .",
    "[ plat - s30 ] for the static quark potential suggests that there should be little to no euclidean time dependence in our observations .",
    "indeed this is the case for the shape of the observed vacuum action suppression . as emphasized in sec .",
    "[ results10 ] , an examination of normalized contour plots reveals no discernible @xmath31 dependence in the flux - tube distribution .",
    "however , the depth of the relative vacuum - action suppression does indeed display a @xmath31 dependence which is associated with the use of a highly - improved lattice action density composed of 4-sweep ape - smeared links .",
    "figure  [ taudep ] displays curves similar to that reported in fig .  [ nodes ] , but this time for the second through fifth quark separations listed in table  [ tab : coord ] .",
    "results for @xmath72 , 4 , and 6 are illustrated for shapes 2 and 3 while the signal quality allows us to consider only @xmath72 and 4 for shapes 4 and 5 . here",
    "the y - shape source is considered .     for various y - shape sources of table  [ tab : coord ] where",
    "the euclidean time dependence of the vacuum - action suppression can be examined . here , @xmath32 is along the long direction of the quark plane ( @xmath73 ) and with @xmath74 the centre of the node is encountered .",
    "results are for the 30-sweep smeared sources . ]    as the curves of fig .",
    "[ taudep ] pass directly through the centre of the node and the flux - tube to the right of the node , the amplitude of the relative vacuum - action suppression , @xmath66 , may be simply read off the plot . while there is substantial enhancement of @xmath66 in going from @xmath72 to 4 , the value for @xmath66 saturates at @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the effect of further euclidean time evolution is to enhance the amplitude , @xmath66 , of the relative vacuum - action expulsion .",
    "the enhancement factor is uniform over the various separations at 1.3(1 ) .",
    "applying this correction to our earlier results for the seventh quark separation where the node and flux tube are well separated , we find @xmath76 and 0.072(6 ) for the node and flux - tube respectively .",
    "we have studied extensively correlations of the vacuum - action density with wilson loops describing the three - quark static - baryon system as defined in eq .",
    "( [ correl ] ) . a high - statistics approach based on the translational and rotational symmetry of the four - dimensional lattice volume",
    "is adopted to avoid the need for gauge - dependent smoothing techniques .",
    "the correlations indicate that the vacuum - action density is suppressed in the interior and surrounding volume in accord with previous findings in the quark - antiquark case .",
    "`` flux tubes '' represent the expulsion or suppression of vacuum gluon - field fluctuations .    for small quark separations ,",
    "the ground state is accessed easily through the use of spatially - smeared ape links in the construction of the source and sink of the three - quark system . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ytube3 ] , the vacuum - action suppression is quite spherical just outside the quark positions , and is strongest in the very centre of the three - quark system . as such , there is no evidence of the formation of a @xmath2-shape flux - tube ( empty triangle ) distribution .",
    "as the quarks become more separated the vacuum expulsion takes the shape of a solid or filled triangle .",
    "we conclude that at small quark separations _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath77 fm y - shape flux - tube formation does not occur . as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ ttube3 ] , [ ytube3 ] and [ ytube4 ] a localized junction of flux tubes is not observed . for quark separations where the quarks are more than 0.5 fm from the system centre ,",
    "flux - tube formation is observed , in support of refs .  .",
    "here , the action distribution shows some dependence on the source due to the limited euclidean time evolution that is possible . through a study of 8 t and y shapes and 11 l shapes of varying sizes ,",
    "we are able to quantitatively demonstrate that the observed potential is a linear function of the length of string required to connect the quark positions to the observed position of the node connecting the flux tubes .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ pot - ls ] and [ pot - ls - s30 ] for the 10- and 30-sweep sources respectively . as such",
    ", the ground state potential at large quark separations is the flux - tube distribution which minimizes this length . in this case",
    "the node will be located at the fermat point .",
    "we have shown that t - shape sources have a flux - tube distribution which relaxes towards a y - shape distribution as the ground state of the static quark potential is accessed .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tshape7-s30 ] with the corresponding effective potentials presented in fig .",
    "[ ysmear - comp ] . while the formation of a y - shape flux - tube has been observed before ( see @xcite for example ) , to the best of our knowledge",
