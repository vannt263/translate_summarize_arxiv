    "the chamaeleon ( cha ) ii molecular cloud is one of five clouds that were mapped with the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) as part of the `` from molecular cores to planet - forming disks '' legacy project @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the `` cores to disks '' ( c2d ) legacy project is to study the evolution of star and planet formation from cold molecular cores to protoplanetary disks in a range of environments .",
    "the project makes use of all of the instruments on the sst ( the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) , the infrared array camera ( irac ) , and the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) ) to observe nearby molecular clouds , isolated regions of star formation , and young stellar objects ( ysos ) , defined broadly in this work as sources with infrared excesses .",
    "one goal of the c2d project is to survey the yso population of the five large molecular clouds for new candidate protostars as well as substellar objects down to 0.001 .",
    "this work describes mips observations of one of the molecular clouds mapped by c2d , cha ii , and is the first of a series of papers that present initial results from the c2d observations .",
    "we also present a new millimeter map of cha ii from simba on the swedish - eso submillimetre telescope ( sest ) .",
    "the irac observations of cha ii will be described by porras et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "later papers will follow that combine the data from all of the sst observations as well as complementary observations at other wavelengths and include further analysis of the ysos and cloud environments .",
    "chamaeleon is a star forming region in the southern sky that includes at least half a dozen distinct clouds @xcite .",
    "( @xmath1 = 13 , @xmath2 = @xmath377 ; j2000 ) , at a distance of 178 @xmath4 18 pc @xcite , is known to harbor dense molecular cores @xcite , t tauri stars , and ysos @xcite",
    ". pointed rosat observations revealed many x - ray sources in cha ii including weak - line and classical t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to low - mass young stars , one intermediate mass ae star , dk cha ( iras 12496 - 7650 ) , and the well - studied herbig - haro object hh 54 ( e.g. , @xcite ) are also associated with cha ii .",
    "@xcite studied a portion of cha ii ( 28  @xmath5 26 ) near the class i source iras 12553 - 7651 ( iso - chaii-28 ) in the mid - infrared ( 6.75 and 14.3 ) with isocam on the iso satellite as well as with near - infrared images and found 4 new candiate ysos ( see their table 4 ) in the observed region .",
    "our mips survey of cha ii covers more area ( about 7 times ) at longer wavelengths ( 24 , 70 , and 160 ) than the iso observations with greater sensitivity ( 1-@xmath0 @xmath6 0.15 mjy at 24 vs.  1.3 mjy at 14 ) .",
    "the five clouds in the c2d survey were chosen to span a range of star formation conditions .",
    "cha ii is one of the most quiescent of the clouds , with only a few known very young ( class i ) objects .",
    "most of the more than 30 previously identified ysos in cha ii are t tauri stars .",
    "cha ii is a typical site of low - mass star formation compared with other regions , with a star formation efficiency ( @xmath71% ; @xcite ) similar to that of taurus ( 2% ; @xcite ) and the ophiuchus - north region ( 0.3% ; _ l _ = 355  12 , _",
    "b _ = 15  23 ; @xcite ) . @xcite studied cha ii with co and iras and reported that the ratio between the mass needed to gravitationally bind the cloud and the gas mass is 7.8 , indicating that cha ii is not gravitationally bound .",
    "they suggest that cha ii may be two independent clouds not bound together , because the co spectrum has two lines .",
    "@xcite mapped cha ii in c@xmath8o and combined their work with previous infrared and optical studies of the cloud .",
    "they report two velocity components in the c@xmath8o for the southeastern part of the cloud and suggest that cha ii and cha iii might be superimposed along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , it is unclear if cha ii itself is bound .",
    "@xcite also compared their cha ii results with similar previous work on other molecular clouds , such as taurus @xcite and the ophiuchus - north region @xcite ( see @xcite table 2 ) . the mean molecular column density ( @xmath9(h@xmath10 ) ) of cha ii , @xmath11 @xmath12 ,",
    "is slightly smaller than that of ophiuchus - north , @xmath13 @xmath12 , or taurus , @xmath14 @xmath12 ( @xcite table 2 ) .",
    "@xcite also found a half - power gaussian linewidth , @xmath15 , of 0.78  in cha ii , which is similar to ophiuchus - north ( @xmath15 = 0.7 ) but greater than taurus ( @xmath15 = 0.49 ) .",
    "@xcite report that the young stars in cha ii are not densely clustered , but in sparse groups .",
    "there is a group of t tauri stars in the southern tip of the cloud , and other known t tauri stars are scattered along the eastern edge and to the east of the cloud @xcite .",
    "the general spitzer mapping strategy of cha ii was consistent with that of the other four molecular clouds in the c2d legacy program @xcite .",
    "all of the area in the cha ii molecular cloud with an a@xmath16 greater than 2 magnitudes @xcite was mapped with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ; @xcite ) on 06 april 2004 ( pid : 176 , aor keys : 0005741056 , 0005744640 , 0005744896 , 0005745152 ) .",
    "a total area of over 1.5 square degrees was mapped in mips fast - scan mode .",
    "the fast - scan mode observes in all mips wavelength bands ( 24 , 70 , and 160 ) simultaneously .",
    "the pixel size is 2.5  at 24 , 10  at 70 , and 16  @xmath5 18  at 160 .",
    "a more detailed desciption of the mips instrument can be found in @xcite or in chapter 8 of the @xcite .",
    "cha ii was covered by two spitzer astronomical observation requests ( aors ) , 1  long in the scan direction by 11 scan legs ( 0.7 ) and 14 scan legs ( 0.9 ) wide .",
    "the scan legs were offset from each other by 240 .",
    "figure [ av_yso ] shows the 24  map of cha ii ; the scan direction is approximately east - west . in fast - scan mode , mips integrates for 3 seconds per pointing on the sky . any individual position on the sky",
    "is observed 5 times at 24 and 70  for an integration time of 15 seconds per position on the sky .",
    "however , the effective 70 field of view ( fov ) is only half that of the 24  array ( about 5  @xmath5 5 ) , because only one half of the 70 array returns useable data .",
    "the 160  coverage in fast - scan mode is not complete by design .",
    "the 160  array has a fov of only 0.5  @xmath5 5  and is further reduced by a dead read - out @xcite .",
    "the integration time at any position on the sky at 160  is either 0 or 3 seconds in fast - scan mode .",
    "the integration times are higher in all bands in regions where the scan legs or aors overlap .    the entire cloud was observed twice .",
    "the second observation , or epoch , began about 6 hours after the first .",
    "the aors were designed with a 3 to 6 hour separation of epochs to enable the detection and removal of asteroids at 24 .",
    "the two epochs were offset from one another on the sky by about half an array ( 125 ) in the cross scan direction .",
    "the offset was designed to fill in the gaps left by the side of the 70  array that does not return usable data .",
    "this observation strategy results in approximately the same coverage at 24 and 70  but less total ( 2-epoch ) integration time at 70  ( 15 seconds ) than at 24  ( 30 seconds ) .",
    "additionally , the second epoch was shifted by 80  in the scan direction to partially fill the gaps in the 160  coverage area .",
    "the 160  coverage is still not complete with two observations , but the gaps are minimized .",
    "millimeter continuum observations were made 10  15 november 2001 with the 37-channel bolometer array simba ( sest imaging bolometer array ) at the sest on la silla , chile .",
    "we observed two regions which cover the areas of highest optical extinction towards the cha ii complex .",
    "the northern region has an approximate extent of @xmath17 , and the southern one has an extent of roughly @xmath18 for a total coverage of over 1.2 square degrees .",
    "the area mapped by simba is slightly smaller than and fits within the mips observation area .",
    "simba is sensitive between about @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with an effective frequency of @xmath21 or an effective wavelength of @xmath22 .    in total",
    ", 46 maps were taken in the fast scanning mapping mode with a scanning speed of @xmath23 .",
    "each of the maps consists of 89 subscans in azimuth with a length of 1400 , with 16  of spacing in elevation between subscans ( and thus a total map extent of 1408  in elevation ) .",
    "the pointing uncertainties are of order 7  to 16 , as determined from ( and corrected on the basis of ) offsets between the simba and mips positions of iras 12496 - 7650 , while the sest has a hpbw of 24  at @xmath24 .",
    "the zenith opacity , which was determined by skydips performed at least every second hour for most of the data ( and at least every fifth hour in some cases ) , ranged from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "maps of uranus and mars were used for calibration purposes .",
    "the derived calibration factor of @xmath27 is in very good agreement with the factor of @xmath28 determined by the telescope crew for this observing period .",
    "based on frequent observations of @xmath29 carin , we estimate the relative calibration uncertainty to be within @xmath415% .",
    "mips images were processed by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) using the standard pipeline ( version s9.5 ) to produce basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the bcd images were then further corrected for some instrumental signatures as described below .",
    "other instrumental signatures , e.g. , dark latents , column and row pulldown effects , and streaks extending from bright objects , have not been corrected .",
    "bright latent images occur at roughly 60  intervals in the scan direction after a bright object .",
    "no attempt was made to explicitly remove cosmic rays or bright latent images from the bcd images .",
    "we used either the redundancy and outlier rejection in mosaicking , or inspection , to avoid mis - identifying these as point sources .",
    "some of the bright latent images can be seen to the east and west of the bright sources in the 24  map of cha ii ( fig .",
    "[ av_yso ] ) .",
    "complete details of the c2d processing are available from the ssc in the documentation at _ http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/legacy/ _ @xcite .      with the 24 @xmath30 m array , a `` jailbar '' pattern results from bright sources or from cosmic ray hits .",
    "the jailbars are time - dependent variations in the relative gains between readouts in the array .",
    "we applied a multiplicative correction to each bcd frame for any detectable fixed - amplitude jailbar pattern across the array , bringing lower columns up to the level of the highest columns .",
    "for some data , we corrected the jailbarring in two sections , rows above and rows below a bright object .",
    "a few frames had a more complex jailbar pattern and these were dropped from further analysis .",
    "also , `` first frame '' corrections were applied .",
    "scale factors were applied to the first four frames in a map to bring them up to the median of subsequent frames .",
    "finally , frames in each scan leg were median - combined to create `` self - flats '' .",
    "each frame was divided by the self - flat for that scan leg .",
    "this procedure corrected for residual jailbarring and a 1 to 2% gradient along the column direction .",
    "uncertainties resulting from these corrections to the pixel values are estimated to be typically @xmath31 0.2 % , and the resulting uncertainties in point - source fluxes @xmath31 0.03 mjy .",
    "this uncertainty is small compared to other sources of uncertainties .",
    "the 70 and 160  data contain several instrumental signatures .",
    "the ssc provided two types of bcd images : normally processed ( unfiltered ) , and those with a time - median filter applied that removes most of the background signal ( filtered ) . following the current recommendation of the ssc , we used the 70  filtered data to obtain point - source fluxes .",
    "however , only the unfiltered data preserve extended emission .",
    "we are interested ultimately in fluxes for both point sources and extended emission . in this paper",
    ", we present preliminary maps made from unfiltered 70 and 160  data .",
    "the 70  map includes approximate corrections for instrumental effects as described below .",
    "the flux calibration for extended emission in the 70 and 160  data is uncertain at the present time .",
    "the corrections applied at 70  may not lead to properly calibrated data .",
    "the maps should be seen as only illustrating rough levels of extended emission .",
    "first , after stimulator ( stim ) flashes in 70  data , there was a `` stim latent '' signal present in subsequent bcd frames .",
    "the first frame after the stim flash was most affected ; 4 frames after the stim flash could have some residual effect .",
    "we applied a column - by - column subtractive correction based on the level after the latents decayed .",
    "second , the unfiltered data had striped patterns approximately along the column direction due to suspected response variations ( of order several @xmath5 10% ) .",
    "we created an `` illumination correction '' made from the data themselves by median - combining frames in each scan leg .",
    "however , the corrected data are of uneven quality .",
    "surface brightness uncertainties introduced by these corrections are difficult to estimate without better understanding of the instrument",
    ". however the amplitude of the illumination corrections , several @xmath5 10% , may be a rough estimate .",
    "no changes were made to 160  unfiltered bcd data as the steps needed for extended - source calibration are still in a preliminary stage .",
    "the mosaic images produced for each wavelength are important both for the overview they provide of the mapped area , especially of the diffuse extended emission , and because our source extraction process begins by searching for sources in the mosaics .",
    "a three - color ( 24 , 70 , & 160 ) mosaicked image of cha ii is shown in figure [ map ] .",
    "this map shows the unfiltered 70 and 160  data to display the extended emission in cha ii . the primary tool for mosaicking is the spitzer science center s `` mopex '' code @xcite .",
    "this code includes a continuously evolving set of modules that correct for some problems in the bcd and attempt to piece many bcd images together into large mosaics .",
    "optional modules exist to filter out radiation hits ( outlier rejection ) and to correct for small positional errors in the fits headers ( position refinement ) .    for the 24  data , we have used mopex with the outlier rejection and position refinement modules turned on with nominal parameters .",
    "in order to detect asteroids , we have divided the total data set into two separate groups of bcd images , according to the two epochs in which our data were acquired , and processed each independently .",
    "the actual process of identifying asteroids and combining the two epochs into a single , higher reliability source list is described later in section [ bandmerge ] . in total , we construct mosaics for each epoch separately plus a combined mosaic in which the highest signal - to - noise ratio is obtained .    as part of its standard processing",
    ", mopex makes use of mask files to avoid including bcd pixels in the final mosaic that have been identified as having some problem . for our mosaics , we have used a combination of the masks created in the initial c2d processing together with the outlier masks constructed during the outlier - rejection processing by mopex .",
    "the masks created by the c2d team effectively combine the bad pixel masks ( `` pmask '' ) and the bad detection masks ( `` dmask '' ) of the ssc .",
    "the geometry of the mosaics constructed with mopex for this paper was such that we kept a 1:1 pixel size ratio between the basic instrument pixel size and mosaic pixel size , and we assembled the bcd images in a coordinate system essentially fixed with respect to the average instrument rotation projected on the sky .",
    "the former minimizes file sizes and processing time .",
    "the latter simplifies the process of point source extraction from the mosaics since the instrumental psf will have the same rotational orientation for any mosaic .",
    "the process of source extraction involves finding likely compact objects in the data and characterizing them by flux , position , and some estimate of the way in which they might differ from a `` perfect '' point - like object .",
    "the details of our point source extractor will be described in a future paper ( harvey et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , but we summarize the main points here .    the source extraction tool , c2dphot , is based on the venerable `` dophot '' code described by @xcite .",
    "our version includes the following important modifications to dophot : ( 1 ) utilizes a digitized point source profile , rather than analytic , to best match the real spitzer data ; ( 2 ) accepts floating point input fits images and computes output fluxes based on the spitzer surface brightness units in the bcd images ; ( 3 ) accepts input masks to avoid using pixels that have been declared bad for whatever reason ; ( 4 ) includes a multiframe mode that fits fluxes and positions from the entire stack of bcd frames relevant to any input source position using the un - smoothed instrumental psf rather than that produced by the mosaicking process .",
    "the most significant unchanged aspect of c2dphot / dophot is the basic source extraction process . in particular",
    ", c2dphot starts at an upper flux level , finds and characterizes sources above that level , and subtracts them from the image .",
    "it then works its way down in flux , typically by a factor of 2 step each time , doing the same thing until it reaches the lower flux limit input by the user .",
    "if c2dphot finds an object that is better fit by a two - axis ellipsoid than the numerical point source profile , it will classify the object as extended and produce estimates of the source size and tilt of the ellipse .",
    "like any source extractor , there are many tunable parameters in c2dphot to enable it to deal with a variety of problems or characteristics in the data .",
    "we discuss the most important here and how we have tuned them for the sources found in this analysis .",
    "the most sensitive parameters for both accurate source extraction and photometry are the sizes of the search box , fitting box , and aperture photometry boxes . for these data , we used search and aperture boxes of 7 pixels and a fitting box of 5 pixels , based on a number of tests on simulated data sets as well as a variety of real data from spitzer .",
    "other tunable parameters include thresholds for deciding whether a source is extended , whether an initial detection is better fitted by a tilted plane , and whether a source is so small that it is more likely to be a previously undetected radiation hit .",
    "these have all been tuned to levels that appear appropriate from careful visual inspections of subsets of the data .",
    "the details of the c2dphot source extraction processing for the 24  data involve running the source extractor first on the mosaic image produced by mopex .",
    "then the multi - frame option is run with the output list from the previous processing given as an input list for flux , position , and shape refinement , but no new source searching . as mentioned above",
    ", this procedure insures that the source characteristics are derived from the least - processed form of the data , the bcd products . for mips 70  data we have extracted sources from the mosaics made with the filtered bcd images with c2dphot .",
    "the calibration of source fluxes is done in the following way .",
    "for all objects for which a reliable aperture flux could be determined and which were well fitted by the nominal point source profile , the ratio of the aperture flux to model flux was averaged .",
    "the fact that this ratio is not unity is expected since the model fluxes are essentially the product of a single number , the fitted peak value , multiplied by the psf area .",
    "small errors and uncertainties in the psf area will then lead to errors in the total model flux .",
    "we then assume that this average ratio of aperture flux to model flux applies for all point sources and multiply by an additional correction factor of about a factor of two at 24  for the aperture used in c2dphot relative to that for the absolute calibration used by the ssc ( essentially a traditional `` aperture correction '' ) .",
    "this correction introduces absolute flux uncertainties of up to 10% .",
    "relative flux and position uncertainties in c2dphot are calculated in a standard way from a numerical estimate of the hessian matrix ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the matrix of partial gradients of chi - squared is calculated numerically for variations in the four model parameters ( for point sources ) .",
    "this is done by fixing each parameter at levels slightly offset above and below the best fit parameter and calculating the change in chi - squared for all combinations of offset parameters .",
    "the diagonal elements of the square root of the inverse of this matrix then give an error estimate , at least in the case where the errors are reasonably behaved .",
    "a random check of the off - diagonal elements has shown that the only significant correlation between error estimates is that expected between the derived sky level of the fit and the peak star amplitude .",
    "for extended extractions a similar procedure is part of dophot and c2dphot using analytic , rather than numerical estimates of the derivatives .",
    "the absolute uncertainty in the fluxes is at least 5% at 24 , 10% at 70 , and 20% at 160  as estimated by the mips instrument team @xcite .",
    "however , considering uncertainties introduced by the `` aperture correction '' in c2dphot , we estimate the total uncertainty in these data to be closer to 10% at 24 and 20% at 70 and 160 .",
    "the 24 and 70 @xmath30 m bands were processed differently in the bandmerging stage of the c2d pipeline because the 70 @xmath30 m band has only one effective epoch of observations .",
    "our observations were planned so that our second epoch would fill in the gaps in the coverage at 70 @xmath30 m caused by the unusable half of the array .",
    "the final list of sources and fluxes was produced in three steps .",
    "first , the source extractions for 24 @xmath30 m in the two epochs are compared .",
    "a source detection in one epoch that has only a single match within 20 in the other epoch and no other matches in its own epoch is considered a `` good '' source and the two detections are averaged .",
    "detections that do not have any match within 20 in either epoch or detections with more than one match in an epoch are suspect sources and these are checked to ensure no valid sources are missed .",
    "the candidate sources are then filtered to include only those sources with fluxes greater than or equal to 10 times the flux uncertainty ( 10-@xmath0 ) .",
    "asteroids , which are bright at 24 @xmath30 m , shift positions between the two epochs . as a result",
    ", they are excluded in this step because an asteroid detected in one epoch will not have a corresponding detection within 20 in the second epoch .",
    "as expected , due to cha ii s ecliptic latitude of @xmath365 , no asteroids were detected at 24  in the data .",
    "asteroids are not bright enough at 70  to be detected .    in step two , the filtered source extractions for 24 @xmath30 m are compared with the source extractions made from the combined - epochs images .",
    "a good source detection has only a single match within 20 in both the filtered list and the combined epochs list . for these sources ,",
    "the position and flux information from the combined epochs detection is substituted as the best value for the source . as in step 1 , sources not detected within 20 in both the filtered list and the combined - epochs list or sources containing multiple detections within 20 in either list are examined and saved if merited .",
    "the final list of good sources at 24 @xmath30 m is again filtered to only include those with fluxes greater than or equal to 10-@xmath0 . because we only have one epoch of observations at 70 @xmath30 m",
    ", only the sigma clipping was performed in this step for the 70 @xmath30 m data .",
    "the 24 and 70 @xmath30 m bands were merged in step three .",
    "the source extraction program produced many artificial detections near the ends of the mips scan legs at 70 .",
    "most of these false detections were eliminated from the source list by the 10-@xmath0 cut and by removing sources with aperture fluxes less than or equal to zero .",
    "the final 70  source list was then bandmerged with the 24 source list .",
    "the simba 1 mm mosaics were reduced and combined using the mopsic software package .",
    "the noise in the maps forces us to subtract correlated skynoise and baselines of order 2 , which both filter out emission on large scales .",
    "the correlated skynoise was evaluated as a weighted mean of the channels spaced by more than 50  from the channel to be corrected .",
    "thus the response to extended sources ( i.e. , with a diameter larger than the `` correlation '' radius of 50 ) is damped by the skynoise filter .",
    "such sources are not quantitatively preserved .",
    "compact ( i.e. , diameter less than 50 ) and unresolved sources ( i.e. , diameter less than a beam ) are not significantly affected by the filter . in total",
    ", 7 noisy maps and several subscans with spikes and drifts were not included in the mosaic in order to improve the noise level and to minimize artifacts .",
    "the final on - source integration time is therefore @xmath32 .",
    "we apply a reduction scheme with three iteration steps , which reduces the filtering of extended emission by skynoise subtraction . after the first step ,",
    "regions with significant emission are identified and included in a source model . in the second step ,",
    "the source model is first subtracted from the deconvolved raw data before skynoise and baseline removal , and then again added to the data before coadding .",
    "this yields a map in which the extended emission is better preserved from spatial filtering by the skynoise filter , while the impact of baseline removal is not mitigated .",
    "the improved map is then used to obtain an improved source model , which then is used in a third and final iteration step to derive the final map .",
    "we correct for pointing uncertainties by shifting maps by the offset between the simba and mips positions of iras 12496 - 7650 observed for the respective epoch ( i.e. , by 7  to 16 ) .",
    "1532 sources at 24  and 41 sources at 70  were identified with fluxes greater than 10-@xmath0 .",
    "normal source extraction techniques were not possible on the 160  data because the emission is so extended and the coverage was incomplete . however , several bright peaks are seen in the map , and 160  aperture fluxes are presented for two sources discussed in section [ int ] . in the mosaics , the median background and rms noise values in the off - cloud regions where structured dust emission is low are 16 and 0.1 mjy ster@xmath33 at 24 , 6 and 0.8 mjy ster@xmath33 at 70 , and 30 and 4.5 mjy ster@xmath33 at 160 .    to determine approximate completeness limits",
    ", we plot two parameters versus source magnitude : cumulative source counts and extracted uncertainty .",
    "figure [ comp ] shows the cumulative source counts for 24 and 70  in cha ii .",
    "the 24  counts include all sources extracted from the mosaic with no sigma cut ( 2481 sources ) .",
    "the 70  cumulative source counts only include greater than 10-@xmath0 sources verified by eye to be real ( 41 sources ) since the source extraction produced many artificial detections at the end of the scan legs in this band .",
    "the 24 and 70  magnitudes were calculated using zero point fluxes derived from a blackbody corresponding to vega ( table [ zero ] ) .",
    "the source counts flatten at the faintest magnitudes , indicating completeness to about 10 mag ( 0.7 mjy ) at 24  and 3 mag ( 50 mjy ) at 70 .",
    "plots of magnitude uncertainty versus magnitude for cha ii , figure [ comp ] , show that the uncertainty reaches 0.1 magnitude at close to the same values as the turnover in source counts , 10 mag at 24  and 3 mag at 70 .",
    "experience with other large surveys suggests that 0.1 magnitude uncertainty is usually about where the 90% completeness level lies .",
    "the 24  flux limit of 0.7 mjy is consistent with the 3-@xmath0 sensitivity ( 0.83 mjy for 24 seconds integration ) predicted for the c2d program by @xcite .",
    "however , the 70  limit of 50 mjy is much higher than the 10-@xmath0 sensitivity predicted prior to launch ( 17 mjy in 24 seconds ; @xcite ) partially due to the loss of half of the array and resultant cut in the integration time .",
    "the observed completeness limits are about 5 and 6 times the ssc s expected post - launch 1-@xmath0 sensitivities with low background and appropriate integration times at 24 and 70  respectively",

    "towards iras 12553 the mass derived from the continuum emission and the mass derived from @xmath71 agree , there is a significant difference between the mass estimates for the extended gas near iras 12496 .",
    "the different mass recovery fractions could be due to the effect of spatial filtering .",
    "if the gas near iras 12553 is in more compact structures than the gas near iras 12496 , then a larger fraction of its mass will be recovered ; gas significantly more extended than that near iras 12553 would be filtered out by the data reduction and would not show up in our maps .",
    "the different mass recovery fractions could in principle also be due to differences in the dust temperatures . if one assumes that the dust near iras 12496 is cooler than the dust near iras 12553 , then the difference in their mass recovery fractions is smaller than when assuming a common dust temperature .",
    "to give an example , a common mass recovery fraction of 50% is inferred when assuming temperatures of @xmath72 for dust near iras 12496 and @xmath73 for dust near iras 12553 .",
    "our spitzer images do not allow us to confirm such temperature differences , as the calibration for extended emission is currently uncertain .",
    "the lack of additional detections of compact emission suggests that only a small fraction of the gas in the complex ( @xmath74 as estimated by @xcite from @xmath75 observations ) is in compact structures with column densities exceeding 10@xmath76 @xmath12 ( corresponding to 60 mjy beam@xmath33 , the typical noise level in our maps ) .",
