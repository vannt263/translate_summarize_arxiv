    "the true star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies at various redshifts is one of the most fundamental physical quantities to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "especially , the sfr density of galaxies in a cosmic volume is a very convenient tool to explore the galaxy evolution .",
    "the concept of the cosmic sfr density was originally introduced by @xcite , and subsequently it has been measured observationally at various redshifts up to @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .    since the sfr of galaxies",
    "is essentially determined by measuring observables related to the ultraviolet ( uv ) flux from ob stars , like hydrogen recombination lines or forbidden lines through ionizing uv photons , or uv continuum itself .",
    "however , the largest uncertainty to determine the sfr from these observables is the dust extinction . since active star formation ( sf ) is always accompanied by dust production because of various dust grain formation processes related to the final stage of stellar evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is always necessary to deal with the energy `` hidden '' by dust . the absorbed energy by dust is reradiated by dust grains at far - infrared ( fir ) wavelengths ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "now it is shown that the fraction of the hidden star formation is even dominant at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward way to remedy the dust extinction problem would be to sum up the sfr calculated from observed ( uncorrected ) uv and fir luminosities @xcite .",
    "however , this is not always possible to obtain both restframe uv and fir flux , especially at high redshifts to date .    in general for local galaxies ,",
    "when dust grains in galaxies absorb uv light , shorter wavelength flux is more strongly attenuated than longer one , which causes _ reddening _ of galaxy spectra .",
    "then , the strength of reddening and absorption fraction of uv are expected to be related in some way . evaluating this process ,",
    "@xcite ( hereafter m99 ) proposed a formula to estimate dust attenuation from the slope of the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum , @xmath0 .",
    "this is based on the tight relation between the infrared ( ir ) to ultraviolet flux ratio ( traditionally referred to as the infrared excess : irx ) and @xmath0 .",
    "since this method does not require any other wavelength data to obtain the value of attenuation , like ir emission , it was very much appreciated by researchers of high - redshift galaxies ( @xmath5 or more ) .",
    "this is because the dust emission of such high-@xmath6 galaxies is usually much more difficult to observe , and their uv spectra are observed at optical wavelengths thanks to the redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the irx-@xmath0 relation is very popularly used in these studies up to now .",
    "however , recently , subsequent studies have shown that the original formula of m99 does not always fit to local galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "especially , rather quiescently star - forming galaxies tend to distribute significantly below the irx-@xmath0 relation of m99 .",
    "in addition , another extreme categories of starburst galaxies , luminous and ultraluminous ir galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs , respectively ) , occupy a region well above the m99 relation @xcite .",
    "also , it is reported that high-@xmath6 star - forming galaxies also tend to deviate from the m99 relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the m99 s irx-@xmath0 relation was proposed for uv - luminous starburst galaxies , one may think it is not surprising that the m99 sample galaxies have different property from ir - selected galaxies .",
    "indeed , some attempts have been done to explain _ physically _ the discrepancy and dispersion of the irx-@xmath0 relation for various categories of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , since this relation is often applied to high-@xmath6 galaxies whose nature is quite unknown , it is reasonable to examine the m99 relation according to their original recipe for its firm application in future studies .",
    "the original irx-@xmath0 relation of m99 was obtained based on and data .",
    "though the latter was an epoch - making facility for the uv astronomical studies , it had one observational limitation : the aperture of is @xmath7 ellipse with effective circle - equivalent diameter of @xmath8 . as m99 discussed in their original work , the sample of starburst galaxies in m99 sometimes have large angular diameters ( see section  [ subsec : m99 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the beam size of is quite large , and most of the part of galaxies is covered by the instrument .",
    "this difference of apertures of and would cause a problem in the estimation of the irx-@xmath0 relation since it is based on the ratio of the two .    today , we have a much larger dataset open to public at uv bands provided by .",
    "( galaxy evolution explorer ) is a uv astronomical satellite launched in 2003 by nasa @xcite .",
    "has far - uv ( fuv ) and near - uv ( nuv ) bands , and is performing all - sky survey as well as deep surveys in some sky areas . in this work ,",
    "we reexamine the m99 relation by using the same galaxy sample as m99 , with paying a particular attention to the aperture problem . for this purpose",
    ", we use nuv and fuv images for the m99 s original sample galaxies . another important aspect of using  filters for estimating @xmath0 of the m99 s sample is that since the main target of the dust correction by the irx-@xmath0 relation is high-@xmath6 galaxies , for which usually only broadband photometric data are available . since  data are spectroscopic , it is crucial to recalibrate photometrically estimated uv slope with directly measured one from  spectroscopic data ( see section  [ subsubsec : filter ] ) .",
    "it is also interesting and important to examine the irx-@xmath0 relation from the fir side . for this",
    ", we also have a large all - sky ir data obtained by .",
    "is an infrared astronomical satellite launched in 2006 by jaxa ( japan aerospace exploration agency ) .",
    "is equipped with two imaging instruments , a near- and mid - ir camera irc @xcite and fir surveyor fis @xcite , and a fourier spectrograph @xcite . in this study , we make use of the data obtained by fis .",
    "the fis has four photometric bands , _",
    "( @xmath9 m ) , _ wide - s _",
    "( @xmath10 m ) , _ wide - l _",
    "( @xmath11 m ) , and _ n160 _ ( @xmath12 m ) .",
    "since has longer wavelength bands than that of , we can estimate the total fir emission from dust directly without any complicated conversion formula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , with  and  data , we can obtain an unbiased irx-@xmath0 relation for the m99 sample .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : sample ] , we describe the data of m99 and measurements newly done in this study .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] , we first show the result of the - irx-@xmath0 relation . then we examine this new relation , and discuss the origin of the discrepancy between the m99 relation and recent observations from uv side .",
    "then , we examine the ir side with fis bright source catalog ( fisbsc ) . after considering all the measurement - related effects with  diffuse map , we propose a new irx-@xmath0 relation for the uv - selected starbursts with and . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we further examine some properties related to the irx-@xmath0 relation we obtained in this work .",
    "first we estimate the bolometric correction for fir by  and  flux densities .",
    "then , we examined the behavior of the irx as a function of aperture radius but both on the  and  images . by this analysis , we can obtain the irx only from the central starburst regions of the original m99 sample .",
    "after checking these properties , we finally compare our new relation to various previous results .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "we review the formulation of m99 in appendix  [ sec : meurer ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : akari_diffuse ] , we evaluate the aperture effect in  fisbsc flux densities with  fis diffuse map .",
    "first , we describe the original data of m99 . @xcite has constructed a uv sed atlas of galaxy sample of 143 spiral , irregular , blue compact dwarfs , seyfert 2 , and starburst galaxies with spectrum archive .",
    "m99 selected a subsample of very actively star - forming galaxies from this database which consisted of starburst nucleus , blue compact , and blue compact dwarfs .",
    "further , in order to reduce the effect of small aperture of , m99 have selected galaxies whose surface brightness distribution is strongly concentrated in the central small region . to construct this sample",
    ", they used a criterion for an optical diameter @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is measured at the @xmath15 isophote ) .",
    "we will revisit this issue in the following .",
    "this further selection resulted in 57 starbursts in the sample .",
    "m99 used 44 galaxies which were observed at @xmath16 m and @xmath17 m bands to make the irx@xmath18 plot and obtained the meurer relation .",
    "the sample and its property are summarized in table  [ table : meurer ] .          in order to examine the possible aperture effect of , we remeasured the uv flux densities from images .",
    "as already mentioned ,  has two uv bands , fuv ( @xmath19   ) and nuv ( @xmath20   ) . the  images are available through mast .",
    "we have made a fuv and nuv photometry of the sample galaxies as follows :    1 .   cut out a @xmath21 square subimage from ais images around each galaxy 2 .",
    "select a subimage with the largest exposure time when multiple observations were available .",
    "3 .   measure fuv and nuv flux densities .",
    "the nuv image is taken as the reference .    in this study , it is important to mention that almost all of the sources are resolved by . then , they very often appear as an assembly of small bright patchy regions , and the pipeline misidentifies these fragments as individual objects .",
    "this is referred to as shredding .",
    "we must deal with the shredding to obtain sensible flux density measurements for nearby extended galaxies . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used an idl software package developed by ourselves .",
    "this software performs aperture photometry in the nuv sub - image using a set of elliptical apertures .",
    "total flux density is calculated within the aperture corresponding to the convergence of the growth curve .",
    "the sky background is measured by combining several individual regions around the source .",
    "nuv and fuv flux densities are corrected for galactic extinction using the schlegel map @xcite and the galactic extinction curve of @xcite . a detailed description of the photometry process can be found in @xcite .",

    "we see that our new irx-@xmath0 relation corresponds to the intermediate @xmath139 galaxies similar to normally star forming galaxies , now consistent with the original m99 sample .",
    "@xcite independently made essentially the same analysis with this study but with their own  photometry and -based ir flux estimation with a conversion formula of @xcite , with _",
    "measurement for a subsample of 12 galaxies their formula is , as we expect , not very different from our result [ eq .  (",
    "[ eq : irx_beta_akari ] ) ] , but slightly deviated upward than ours at large @xmath0 and high irx regime .",
    "they have measured the uv flux up to @xmath144 times kron radius of galaxies , their converged values are on average twice larger than the original values of m99 . as we have shown , the  flux is underestimated with a factor of 2.5 on average , and sometimes the underestimation is of an order of magnitude . hence , though they discuss that the quiescent ir galaxies in @xcite locate lower than their line , for example , this might be due to the uv flux still missed .",
    "the relation between the ratio of infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) flux densities ( the infrared excess : irx ) and the slope of the uv spectrum ( @xmath0 ) of galaxies plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of the dust attenuation of star forming galaxies especially at high redshifts .",
    "m99 first introduced a very useful method to estimate the dust attenuation by using the relation between the fir - to - fuv flux ratio and the uv slope , the irx-@xmath0 relation .",
    "however , subsequent studies revealed a dispersion and/or systematic deviation from the original irx-@xmath0 relation of m99 , depending on sample selection .",
    "we reexamined the original irx-@xmath0 relation proposed by m99 by measuring the far- and near - uv flux densities of the original sample galaxies used by m99 with imaging data .",
    "we summarize our conclusion as follows :    1 .",
    "the uv flux densities of the galaxies used in m99 were significantly underestimated because of the small aperture of which was @xmath7 . consequently , the irx values were lower than that in m99 , which lead the irx-@xmath0 relation shifted downward on the plot .",
    "2 .   the aperture effect affected not only the irx but also @xmath0 , because the curve of growth of the flux densities is a function of aperture which depends strongly on the wavelength .",
    "correcting the aperture effect , we obtained a new irx-@xmath0 relation for uv - selected starburst galaxies for the same sample with m99 .",
    "the original relation was obtained based on  data .",
    "since  bands cover only a wavelength range of @xmath1 m , the fir flux calculated from  flux does not represent the total ir emission from dust .",
    "we used data from which has a much wider wavelength coverage especially toward longer wavelengths , and obtained an appropriate irx-@xmath0 relation for the data with total dust emission .",
    "we also estimated the irx-@xmath0 relation of the sample as a function both on the  and  images .",
    "we found that the irx-@xmath0 relation of the central starburst regions of the sample locates significantly below the relation obtained for the whole galaxy regions .",
    "this means that the extended dust emission is important to evaluate various global properties of galaxies , though we need to know the behavior of the psfs of akari diffuse map more precisely to evaluate more quantitatively .",
    "6 .   in many previous studies",
    ", authors use a conventional conversion factor ( bolometric correction : bc ) of @xmath124 to obtain the total ir flux from dust .",
    "we examined the bc of dust emission and found that indeed the value was @xmath128 on average .",
    "our new relation is consistent with most of the preceding results on the irx-@xmath0 relation for samples selected at optical and uv , though there is a significant scatter around it .",
    "we also found that even the quiescent class of ir galaxies follow this new relation , though luminous and ultraluminous ir galaxies distribute completely differently .",
    "the irx-@xmath0 relation for the central starburst regions of m99 s sample galaxies is very similar to the relation proposed by @xcite , based on the smc attenuation curve .",
    "this may imply interesting property of high-@xmath6 star - forming galaxies .    in this work , we constructed a proper formula for a category of galaxies which are luminous in uv and actively forming stars .",
    "we found that this formula also applies to various class of moderately star - forming galaxies , like optically selected or non - luminous ir selected ones .",
    "this will be a more firm basis than before when one needs to correct dust extinction of high-@xmath6 galaxies .",
    "however , we should note the large intrinsic scatter on the irx-@xmath0 plane , especially the ( u)lirg population which does not obey the irx-@xmath0 relation at all .",
    "many issues and problems still remain to be solved for understanding this relation .",

    "here , we review the original formulation of the irx-@xmath0 relation by m99 .",
    "@xmath145 where @xmath146 is the unattenuated flux density of the emitted spectrum , @xmath147 is the net absorption in magnitudes by dust as a function of wavelength , and @xmath148 is the ly@xmath149 flux . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : irx_def ] ) , it is assumed that the ionizing photons does not affect dust heating significantly , namely they are not absorbed directly by dust grains ..  % of the bolometric luminosity of starbursts is emitted below 912    @xcite , and the fraction of ionizing photons that is directly absorbed by dust grains is estimated to be @xmath150  % @xcite .",
    "however , the direct absorption of lyman photons by dust grains in ionizing regions has been first discussed by @xcite and extensively by @xcite , who found that the fraction of ionizing photons directly absorbed by dust is significantly larger than these values . however , even if all the ionizing photons were absorbed by dust , they would still not drastically affect the conclusions .",
    "hence , the formulation of m99 will remain valid . ] the ly@xmath149 flux @xmath148 was produced by cascade of photons with wavelengths shorter than 912   , which finally reach the transition @xmath151 .",
    "if the ionized gas in case b , ly@xmath149 is resonantly scattered repeatedly by hydrogen atoms and finally absorbed by dust .",
    "thus , the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : irx_def ] ) corresponds to the total flux absorbed by dust , consisting of two terms , the first is the heating by ly@xmath149 and the second is by nonionizing photons .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : irx_def ] ) represents the observed 1600    flux density which is attenuated by dust .",
    "namely , @xmath152    most of the photons absorbed by dust are contribution from massive stars .",
    "then , by assuming that most of the radiation from massive stars is uv , we can substitute @xmath153 with @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : irx_def ] ) as @xmath154    further , we rearrange eq .",
    "( [ eq : irx_ap1600 ] ) as follows . @xmath155",
    "the subscript asterisk means it is related to stellar emission , and subscript dust means it is for dust emission . here ,",
    "@xmath156 we assume @xmath157 on one hand , @xmath158 can be approximated as a constant if we fix the initial mass function ( imf ) and a constant star formation rate .",
    "if we adopt the salpeter imf @xcite with an upper mass limit of @xmath159 , we have @xmath53 ( m99 ) .",
    "the uncertainty is calculated based on the variation of @xmath160 depending on the burst duration . on the other hand , @xmath161 is the ratio between the total ir flux and the fir flux .",
    "empirically from the  observation @xcite , m99 adopted a value of bc(fir)@xmath54 , which leads @xmath162 . putting them together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : irx_bc ] ) , we obtain @xmath163 which is eq .",
    "( [ eq : irx_extinction ] ) in the main text , the basic relation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the  fisbsc was produced by a dedicated pipeline for point source extraction @xcite . however , for very extended nearby galaxies , the point source assumption is not valid anymore . to examine this `` aperture '' effect in  fis flux density , we measured ir flux density from  fis diffuse map .",
    "we performed this procedure by using both sextractor @xcite and our own software , and both yielded more or less the same result . since @xcite used sextractor , we also present flux density given by sextractor for the diffuse map .",
    "we show the comparison between flux densities from fisbsc and diffuse map for m99 sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : akari_diffuse ] .",
    "basically these flux densities agree well , because m99 put a constraint to have galaxies with a small angular diameter in their sample selection . however , even so , the bsc flux density turned out to be underestimated for non - negligible number of galaxies .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines represent the average difference between bsc and diffuse - map flux densities . for both _ wide - s _ and _",
    "wide - l _ , the average is positive . @xcite",
    "performed a careful comparison of bsc flux density with other well - understood database and concluded that this is due to the underestimation of the bsc and not the overestimation in diffuse map photometry .",
    "thus , we use the diffuse - map based ir flux densities to have the final irx-@xmath0 relation fitting ."
