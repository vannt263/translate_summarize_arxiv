    "why do we live in a magnetized universe ?",
    "a variety of observations imply that stars , planets , galaxies , clusters of galaxies are all magnetized .",

    "it is also useful to express the magnetic field in @xmath0 ( in units @xmath1 ) .",

    "] range from few @xmath4 g ( in the case of galaxies and galaxy clusters ) to few g ( in the case of planets , like the earth ) up to @xmath5 g ( in the case of neutron stars ) .",
    "physical phenomena are characterized depending upon the typical time and length scales where they take place .",
    "magnetic fields of stars and planets are related to length - scales which are much smaller than the diameter of the milky way ( of the order of @xmath6 kpc ) or of the local supercluster . in this sense , a magnetic field of",
    "the order of @xmath4 g is minute on the terrestrial scale but it is sizable over the scale of the supercluster .    in the present review",
    "only large - scale magnetic fields will be considered , i.e. magnetic fields whose typical scale exceeds the au ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields must be understood and treated as an essential part of the largest structures observed in the sky .",
    "legitimate questions arising in the study of magnetized structures concern their formation and evolution .",
    "the answers to these questions are still not completely settled .",
    "specific observations will eventually allow to discriminate between the different competing explanations .",
    "magnetic fields of distant spiral galaxies are in the @xmath4 g range .",
    "there is also compelling evidence of large - scale magnetic fields which are not associated with individual galaxies .",
    "this empirical coincidence reminds a bit of one of the motivations of the standard hot big - bang model , namely the observation that the light elements are equally abundant in rather different parts of our universe .",
    "the approximate equality of the abundances implies that , unlike the heavier elements , the light elements have primordial origin .",
    "the four light isotopes @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are mainly produced at a specific stage of the hot big bang model named nucleosynthesis occurring below the a typical temperature of @xmath12 mev when neutrinos decouple from the plasma and the neutron abundance evolves via free neutron decay .",
    "the abundances calculated in the simplest big - bang nucleosythesis model agree fairly well with the astronomical observations .",
    "in similar terms it is plausible to argue that large - scale magnetic fields have similar strengths at large scales because the initial conditions for their evolutions were the same , for instance at the time of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy . the way the initial conditions for the evolution of large - scale magnetic fields are set",
    "is generically named magnetogenesis .",
    "there is another comparison which might be useful . back in the seventies",
    "the so - called harrison - zeldovich spectrum was postulated .",
    "later , with the developments of inflationary cosmology the origin of a flat spectrum of curvature and density profiles has been justified on the basis of a period of quasi - de sitter expansion named inflation .",
    "it is plausible that in some inflationary models not only the fluctuations of the geometry are amplified but also the fluctuations of the gauge fields .",
    "this happens if , for instance , gauge couplings are effectively dynamical .",
    "as the harrison - zeldovich spectrum can be used as initial condition for the subsequent newtonian evolution , the primordial spectrum of the gauge fields can be used as initial condition for the subsequent magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) evolution which may lead , eventually , to the observed large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "cosmologists and theoretical physicists would like to understand large - scale magnetization in terms of symmetries which are broken .",
    "there are other two different motivations leading , independently , to the study of large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "for instance it was observed long ago by fermi that if cosmic rays are in equilibrium with the galaxy , their pressure density is comparable with the one of the magnetic field of the galaxy .",
    "large - scale magnetic fields are also extremely relevant for astrophysics",
    ". magnetic fields in galaxies are sufficiently intense to affect the dynamics of interstellar gas both on the galactic scale and also on smaller scales characteristic of star formation processes .",
    "this is the third motivation leading to the study of large scale - magnetic fields : the astrophysical motivation which tries to combine our knowledge of the universe in powerful dynamical principles based on the microscopic laws of nature .",
    "the cross - disciplinary character of the physical phenomena addressed in this review is apparent from the table of content . in section 2 a brief historical account of this fifty years old problem",
    "will be given .",
    "then , to clarify the nature of the various theoretical constructions , the empirical evidence of large scale magnetic fields will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains some background material on the evolution of magnetic fields in globally neutral plasmas in flat space .",
    "section 5 and 6 address the problem of the evolution of large scale magnetic fields in curved backgrounds and of their origin . in section 7",
    "the possible effects of magnetic fields on the thermodynamical history of the universe are scrutinized .",
    "section 8 will be concerned with the effects of large scale magnetic fields on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) and on the relic background of gravitational waves . in section 9",
    "the rle of gravitating magnetic fields in cosmological solutions will be swiftly pointed out .",
    "the perspective of present review is theoretical . in this sense various ( very important )",
    "experimental results ( for instance concerning optical polarization ) will receive only a swift attention .",
    "in january 1949 large - scale magnetic fields had no empirical evidence .",
    "the theoretical situation can be summarized as follows :    * the seminal contributions of alfvn @xcite convinced the community that magnetic fields can have a very large life - time in a highly conducting plasma ; * using the new discoveries of alfvn , fermi @xcite postulated the existence of a large - scale magnetic field permeating the galaxy with approximate intensity of @xmath4 g and , hence , in equilibrium with the cosmic rays ; * rather surprisingly alfvn @xcite did not appreciate the implications of the fermi idea and was led to conclude ( incorrectly ) that cosmic rays are in equilibrium with stars disregarding completely the possibility of a galactic magnetic field ; * in 1949 hiltner @xcite and , independently , hall @xcite observed polarization of starlight which was later on interpreted by davis and greenstein @xcite as an effect of galactic magnetic field aligning the dust grains .    according to the presented chain of events it is legitimate to conclude that    * the discoveries of alfvn were essential in the fermi proposal ( who was already thinking of the origin of cosmic rays in 1938 before leaving italy ) ; * the idea that cosmic rays are in equilibrium with the galactic magnetic fields ( and hence that the galaxy possess a magnetic field ) was essential in the correct interpretation of the first , fragile , optical evidence of galactic magnetization .    the origin of the galactic magnetization , according to @xcite , had to be somehow primordial .",
    "this idea was further stressed in two subsequent investigations of fermi and chandrasekar @xcite who tried , rather ambitiously , to connect the magnetic field of the galaxy to its angular momentum .    in the fifties",
    "various observations on polarization of crab nebula suggested that the milky way is not the only magnetized structure in the sky .",
    "the effective new twist in the observations of large - scale magnetic fields was the development ( through the fifties and sixties ) of radio - astronomical techniques . from these measurements , the first unambiguous evidence of radio - polarization from the milky way ( mw )",
    "was obtained @xcite .",
    "it was also soon realized that the radio - zeeman effect ( counterpart of the optical zeeman splitting employed to determine the magnetic field of the sun ) could offer accurate determination of ( locally very strong ) magnetic fields in the galaxy .",
    "the observation of lyne and smith @xcite that pulsars could be used to determine the column density of electrons along the line of sight opened the possibility of using not only synchrotron emission as a diagnostic of the presence of a large - scale magnetic field , but also faraday rotation . in the seventies",
    "all the basic experimental tools for the analysis of galactic and extra - galactic magnetic fields were present . around this epoch",
    "also extensive reviews on the experimental endeavors started appearing and a very nice account could be found , for instance , in the review of heiles @xcite .",
    "it became gradually clear in the early eighties , that measurements of large - scale magnetic fields in the mw and in the external galaxies are two complementary aspects of the same problem .",
    "while mw studies can provide valuable informations concerning the _ local _ structure of the galactic magnetic field , the observation of external galaxies provides the only viable tool for the reconstruction of the _ global _ features of the galactic magnetic fields . as it will be clarified in the following sections , the complementary nature of global and local morphological features of large - scale magnetization may become , sometimes , a source of confusion .    since the early seventies",
    ", some relevant attention has been paid not only to the magnetic fields of the galaxies but also to the magnetic fields of the _ clusters_. a cluster is a gravitationally bound system of galaxies . the _ local group _ ( i.e. _ our _ cluster containing the mw , andromeda together with other fifty galaxies ) is an _ irregular _ cluster in the sense that it contains fewer galaxies than typical clusters in the universe .",
    "other clusters ( like coma , virgo ) are more typical and are then called _ regular _ or abell clusters . as an order of magnitude estimate",
    ", abell clusters can contain @xmath13 galaxies .    in the nineties magnetic fields",
    "have been measured in single abell clusters but around the turn of the century these estimates became more reliable thanks to improved experimental techniques . in order to estimate magnetic fields in clusters , an independent knowledge of the electron density along the line of sight is needed ( see sec .",
    "recently faraday rotation measurements obtained by radio telescopes ( like vla in socorro ( new mexico ) ] ) have been combined with independent measurements of the electron density in the intra - cluster medium .",
    "this was made possible by the maps of the x - ray sky obtained with satellites measurements ( in particular rosat@xmath14 kev .",
    "a catalog of x - ray bright abell clusters was compiled . ] ) .",
    "this improvement in the experimental capabilities seems to have partially settled the issue confirming the measurements of the early nineties and implying that also clusters are endowed with a magnetic field of @xmath15 g strength which is _ not associated with individual galaxies_.    the years to come are full of interesting experimental questions to be answered .",
    "these questions , as it will be discussed in the following , may have a rather important theoretical impact both on the theory of processes taking place in the local universe ( like ultra - high energy cosmic ray propagation ) and on the models trying to explain the origin of large scale magnetic fields .",
    "last but not least , these measurements may have an impact on the physics of cmb anisotropies and , in particular , on the cmb polarization .",
    "in fact , the same mechanism leading to the faraday rotation in the radio leads to a faraday rotation of the cmb _ provided _ the cmb is linearly polarized .",
    "one of the important questions to be answered is , for instance , the nature and strength of the supercluster magnetic field and now more careful statistical studies are starting also along this important direction .",
    "superclusters are gravitationally bound systems of clusters .",
    "an example is the local supercluster formed by the local group and by the virgo cluster .",
    "together rosat , various observations with the einstein , exosat , and ginga satellites showed the presence of hot diffuse gas in the local supercluster .",
    "the estimated magnetic field in this system is , again , of the order of the @xmath4 g but the observational evidence is still not conclusive .",
    "another puzzling evidence is the fact that lyman-@xmath16 systems ( with red - shifts @xmath17 ) are endowed with a magnetic field @xcite .    from the historical development of the subject",
    "a series of questions arises naturally :    * what is the origin of large - scale magnetic fields ? * are magnetic fields primordial as assumed by fermi more than 50 years ago ? * even assuming that large - scale magnetic fields are primordial , is there a theory for their generation ?",
    "before describing the theory of something ( not of everything ) it is highly desirable , in natural sciences , to understand in some detail the empirical evidence of the subject under discussion . while technical accounts of the various experimental techniques exist already @xcite it seems useful , in the present context , to give an account of the experimental situation by emphasizing the physical principles of the various measurements",
    "there are valuable books dealing directly with large - scale magnetism @xcite .",
    "furthermore excellent reviews of the morphological features of large scale magnetism can be found in @xcite . even if the present review will not be concerned with planetary magnetic fields , analogies with physical situations arising closer to the earth",
    "are often useful and , along this perspective , magnetic field observations in the solar system have been recently reviewed @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields observed in the universe have a homogeneous ( or uniform ) component and a non - uniform component .",
    "it is then useful , for the purposes of this section , to write , in a schematic notation , that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the uniform component and @xmath20 the non - uniform component .",
    "both components are phenomenologically very relevant .",
    "different experimental techniques can probe different components of large - scale magnetic fields ( i.e. either the total magnetic field or its homogeneous component ) .",
    "another important distinction is between @xmath21 and @xmath22 : there are measurements ( like synchrotron emission ) which are sensitive to @xmath21 i.e. the transverse component of the magnetic field ; there are other measurements ( like the faraday rotation measure or the zeeman splitting of spectral lines ) which are sensitive to @xmath22 i.e. the magnetic field along the line of sight .      in order to measure large scale magnetic fields , one of the first effects coming to mind ,",
    "is the zeeman effect .",
    "the energy levels of an hydrogen atom in the background of a magnetic field are not degenerate .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field produces a well known splitting of the spectral lines : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the _ uniform component of the magnetic field along the line of sight_. from the estimate of the splitting , the magnetic field intensity can be deduced .",
    "indeed this technique is the one commonly employed in order to measure the magnetic field of the sun @xcite .",
    "the most common element in the interstellar medium is neutral hydrogen , emitting the celebrated @xmath25-cm line ( corresponding to a frequency of @xmath26 mhz ) . if a magnetic field of @xmath4 g strength is present in the interstellar medium , according to eq .",
    "( [ zee ] ) , an induced splitting , @xmath27 , can be estimated .",
    "zeeman splitting of the @xmath25-cm line generates two oppositely circular polarized spectral lines whose apparent splitting is however sub - leading if compared to the doppler broadening .",
    "in fact , the atoms and molecules in the interstellar medium are subjected to thermal motion and the amount of induced doppler broadening is roughly given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the thermal velocity @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of the atom or molecule .",
    "the amount of doppler broadening is @xmath32 khz which is much larger than the zeeman splitting which should be eventually detected .",
    "zeeman splitting of molecules and recombination lines should however be detectable if the magnetic field strength gets larger with the density .",
    "indeed in the interstellar medium there are molecules with an unpaired electron spin . from eq .",
    "( [ zee ] ) it is clear that a detectable zeeman splitting ( i.e. comparable or possibly larger than the doppler broadening ) can be generically obtained for magnetic fields where @xmath33 g , i.e. magnetic fields of the order of the m g. molecules with an unpaired electron spin include oh , cn , ch and some other . in the past",
    ", for instance , magnetic fields have been estimated in oh clouds ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "magnetic fields of the order of @xmath34 m g have been detected in interstellar @xmath35 maser clumps ( with typical densities @xmath36 ) @xcite .",
    "more recently attempts of measuring magnetic fields in cn have been reported @xcite .",
    "the possible caveat with this type of estimates is that the measurements can only be very _ local _ : the above mentioned molecules are much less common than neutral hydrogen and are localized in specific regions of the interstellar medium . in spite of this caveat , zeeman splitting measurements can provide reliable informations on the local direction of the magnetic field .",
    "this determination is important in order to understand the possible origin of the magnetic field .",
    "this aspect will be discussed , in more detail , when describing the magnetic field of the milky way .",
    "the first experimental evidence of the existence of large - scale magnetic fields in external galaxies came , historically , from the synchrotron emission of crab nebula @xcite . the emissivity formula ( i.e. the energy emitted from a unit volume , per unit time , per unit frequency interval and per unit solid angle ) for the synchrotron is a function of @xmath21 and and of the relativistic electron density , namely @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the frequency",
    ", @xmath39 is a proportionality constant depending only upon the spectral index @xmath16 which also determines the ( isotropic ) relativistic electron number density distribution for electrons with energies in the range @xmath40 : @xmath41 a useful estimate for the maximal emission from electrons of energy @xmath42 is given by @xcite @xmath43 in generic terms the synchrotron emission is then sensitive to the _ total _ transverse magnetic field . in oversimplified terms",
    "the measurement proceeds in three steps :    * estimate of the emission intensity ; * from the estimate of the emission intensity , defining as @xmath44 the typical size of the source , the quantity @xmath45 can be deduced ; * the magnetic field can then be obtained by specifying the electron density distribution of the source .",
    "while the second step is rather well defined ( @xmath16 can indeed be determined from the observed emission spectrum are between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "an important caveat to this statement , relevant for foreground extraction ( for instance in studies of cmb anisotropies ) is that the synchrotron spectrum may have a break . ] ) the third step has to be achieved in a model - dependent way .",
    "the relativistic electron density is sometimes estimated using equipartition , i.e. the idea that magnetic and kinetic energy densities may be , after all , comparable .",
    "equipartition is not always an empirical evidence , but can certainly be used as a working hypothesis which may or may not be realized in the system under consideration . for instance equipartition probably holds for the milky way but it does not seem to be valid in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "the average equipartition field strengths in galaxies ranges from the @xmath48 g of m33 up to the @xmath49 g of ngc2276 @xcite .    in order to illustrate the synchrotron emission",
    "take for instance the mw .",
    "away from the region of the galactic plane synchrotron emission is the dominant signal of the galaxy for frequencies below @xmath50 ghz . between @xmath51 and @xmath50 ghz the spectral dependence is @xmath52 .",
    "it should be noticed that the spectral index of synchrotron emission may change in different frequency ranges and also in different regions of the sky due to the variation of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this aspect is crucial in the experimental analysis of cmb anisotropy experiments in the ghz region .",
    "in fact , in the context of cmb studies the synchrotron is a _ foreground _ which should be appropriately subtracted .",
    "the way this is done is by extrapolation of lower frequency measurements .",
    "the problem of proper subtraction of synchrotron foreground is particularly acute in the case of the planck mission to @xmath53 ghz . ]",
    "the synchrotron has an intrinsic polarization which can give the orientation of the magnetic field , but not _ the specific sign of the orientation vector_. the strength of synchrotron polarization is proportional to @xmath54 , i.e. the ratio between the magnetic energy densities of the uniform and total magnetic field .",
    "thus , according to eq .",
    "( [ btot ] ) , the synchrotron polarization is sensitive to the _ random component _ of the large - scale magnetic field .      to infer the magnitude of the magnetic field strength faraday effect has been widely used .",
    "when a polarized radio wave passes through a region of space of size @xmath55 containing a plasma with a magnetic field the polarization plane of the wave gets rotated by an amount @xmath56 which is directly proportional to the square of the plasma frequency ) in the following section . ]",
    "@xmath57 ( and hence to the electron density ) and to the larmor frequency @xmath58 ( and hence to the magnetic field intensity ) .",
    "a linear regression connecting the shift in the polarization plane and the square of the wavelength @xmath59 , can be obtained : @xmath60 by measuring the relation expressed by eq .",
    "( [ regr ] ) for two ( or more ) separate ( but close ) wavelengths , the angular coefficient of the regression can be obtained and it turns out to be @xmath61 in units of @xmath62 when all the quantities of the integrand are measured in the above units .",
    "the explicit dependence of the red - shift can be also easily included in eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) .",
    "notice , in general terms that the rm is an integral over distances .",
    "thus the effect of large distances will reflect in high values of the rm .",
    "furthermore , the faraday effect occurs typically in the radio ( i.e. @xmath63 ) , however , some possible applications of faraday effect in the microwave can be also expected ( see section 8 of the present review ) .",
    "the shift in the polarization plane should be determined with an accuracy greater than @xmath64 .",
    "otherwise ambiguities may arise in the determination of the angular coefficient appearing in the linear regression of eq .",
    "( [ regr ] ) .",
    "this aspect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ farfig ] which is rather standard but it is reproduced here in order to stress the possible problems arising in the physical determination of the rm if the determination of the shift in the polarization plane is not accurate .    the rm defined in eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) not only the magnetic field ( which should be observationally estimated ) , but also the column density of electrons . from the radio - astronomical observations ,",
    "different techniques can be used in order to determine @xmath65 .",
    "one possibility is to notice that in the observed universe there are pulsars .",
    "pulsars are astrophysical objects emitting regular pulses of electromagnetic radiation with periods ranging from few milliseconds to few seconds . by comparing the arrival times of different radio pulses at different radio wavelengths , it is found that signals are slightly delayed as they pass through the interstellar medium exactly because electromagnetic waves travel faster in the vacuum than in an ionized medium .",
    "hence , from pulsars the column density of electrons can be obtained in the form of the dispersion measure , i.e. @xmath66 . dividing the rm by dm , an estimate of the magnetic field can be obtained .",
    "due to their abundance , pulsars lead to the best determination of the magnetic field in the galactic disk @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ f1a ] ( adapted from @xcite ) a map of the antisymmetric rm sky is reported . in the picture",
    "the open circles denote negative rm while filled circles denote positive rm .",
    "the size of the circle is proportional to the magnitude of the rm .",
    "the convention is , in fact , to attribute negative rm to a magnetic field directed away from the observer and positive rm if the magnetic field is directed toward the observer .    as in the case of synchrotron emission also faraday rotation measurements",
    "can be used as a diagnostic for foreground contamination .",
    "the idea would be , in this context to look for cross - correlations in the faraday rotation measure of extra - galactic sources and the measured microwave signal at the same angular position .",
    "a recent analysis has been recently reported @xcite .    if magnetic field or the column density change considerably over the integration path of eq .",
    "( [ fr ] ) one should probably define and use the two - point function of the rm , i.e. @xmath67 the suggestion to study the mean - squared fluctuation of the rm was proposed @xcite .",
    "more recently , using this statistical approach particularly appropriate in the case of magnetic fields in clusters ( where both the magnetic field intensity and the electron density change over the integration path ) , newmann , newmann and rephaeli @xcite quantified the possible ( statistical ) uncertainty in the determination of cluster magnetic fields ( this point will also be discussed later ) .",
    "the rather ambitious program of measuring the @xmath68 power spectrum is also pursued @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the analysis of correlations in the rm has been discussed .      since the early seventies @xcite the magnetic field of the milky way ( mw ) was shown to be parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "rm derived from pulsars allow consistent determinations of the magnetic field direction and intensity @xcite . in the milky way ,",
    "the uniform component of the magnetic field is in the plane of the galactic disk and it is thought to be directed approximately along the spiral arm .",
    "there is , though , a slight difference between the northern and southern hemisphere .",
    "while in the southern hemisphere the magnetic field is roughly @xmath69 g , the magnetic field in the northern hemisphere is three times smaller than the one of the southern hemisphere .",
    "the magnetic field of the mw is predominantly toroidal .. ] however , looking at the center of the galaxy , a poloidal component ( typically @xmath70 of the toroidal one ) has been detected .",
    "in fact , in the central @xmath71 pc of the mw there are in fact pooloidal ( dipole ) fields whose origin is probably primordial @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this statement is that through the usual plasma physics mechanisms ( like the dynamo theory to be discussed later in section 4 ) it is hard to account for a sizable poloidal component , even if localized in the central region of the mw .    the common practice is to classify large - scale magnetic fields in spiral galaxies according to the parity of the toroidal field under reflections of the azimuthal angle @xcite .",
    "according to some authors this distinction palys a crucial rle in order to assess the primordial ( or non - primordial ) nature of the observed field ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "in short , the virtues and limitations of the previous distinction can be summarized as follows .",
    "suppose to plot the toroidal component of the measured magnetic field ( for instance of the mw ) as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath72 .",
    "this is , in fact , equivalent , to plot the @xmath73 for instance near the equatorial plane of the galaxy .",
    "then two qualitatively different situations can arise . in the first case @xmath73 upon rotation of @xmath74 around the galactic center",
    "is even and this corresponds to axisymmetric spiral galaxies ( ass ) . in the second case",
    "@xmath75 upon rotation of @xmath74 around the galactic center is odd and this corresponds to bisymmetric spiral galaxies ( bss ) .",
    "this sharp distinction is invalidated by two experimental facts .",
    "first of all there may be extra phases so that it is not clear , in practice , if @xmath73 is , predominantly , even or odd . in spite of possible ambiguities ( which are",
    ", however , an experimental problem ) the distinction may be very useful : if the magnetic fields would originate through some dynamo amplification the preferred configuration will be of the ass - type and not of the bss - type .",
    "there are strong indications that the mw is a bss spiral @xcite .",
    "a related issue is the _ reversal _ of the magnetic field from one spiral arm to the other . in @xcite",
    "@xmath76 rotation measures from polarization observations of southern pulsars have been reported .",
    "for the galactic disk , convincing evidence of field reversal near the _ perseus _ arm is presented . in the solar circle",
    "three reversals are observed : near the _ carina - sagittarius _ arm , near the _ crux - scutum _ arm , and possibly a third one in the _ norma _ arm .",
    "these reversals are claimed to be consistent with bss models .    since this is a relevant point , the possible controversies arising in the analysis of the magnetic field of the mw",
    "will now be swiftly mentioned .",
    "it is appropriate , for this purpose , to give a geometrical characterization of the arm structure of the mw @xcite .",
    "the spiral structure of the galaxy can be described in terms of a two - dimensional coordinate system @xmath77 whose origin @xmath78 is at the galactic center . in this coordinate system",
    "the sun is located at @xmath79 where the coordinates are expressed in kpc . for each spiral arm",
    "the equation reduces to four curves , each rotated by @xmath80 of the form : @xmath81 in eq .",

    "the region with dashed lines is poorly known from the observational point of view ( `` zona galactica incognita '' in the terminology of valle @xcite ) . in terms of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the basic question related to the magnetic field structure concerns the _ relative _ orientation of the magnetic field direction between one arm and the nearest one .",
    "as mentioned above@xcite some studies suggest that three reversals are present .",
    "some other studies @xcite based on a statistical re - analysis of the most recent data from 1995 to 2001 suggest that _ only one _ reversal is observed .",
    "the two large arrows in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] represent the field directions in the carina - sagittarius and in the perseus arms . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued that the magnetic field of the mw has the structure of axisymmetric spiral .",
    "however , the presence of one field reversal seems to be not fully consistent with this interpretation .",
    "recently @xcite han , manchester , lyne and qiao , using the parkes multibeam pulsar survey , provided further observational support for the detection of a counterclockwise magnetic field in the norma spiral arm .",
    "the morphological properties of the magnetic field in the carina - sagittarius and in the crux - scutum arms have been confirmed @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained from the analysis of pulsar rotation measures .",
    "if the magnetic field of the mw flips its direction from one spiral arm to the other , then , as pointed out by sofue and fujimoto @xcite the galactic magnetic field should probably be associated with a bss model . in the sofue - fujimoto model the radial and azimuthal components of the magnetic field in a bisymmetric logarithmic spiral configuration is given through @xmath85 where @xmath86 kpc is the galactocentric distance of the maximum of the field in our spiral arm , @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the pitch angle of the spiral .",

    "the mechanism here is always related to the idea of biermann with thermoelectric currents developed at the qcd time.since the strange quark is heavier than the up and down quarks there may be the possibility that the quarks develop a net positive charge which is compensated by the electric charge in the leptonic sector . again , invoking the dynamics of a first - order phase transition , it is argued that the shocks affect leptons and quarks in a different way so that electric currents are developed as the bubble wall moves in the quark - gluon plasma . in @xcite",
    "the magnetic field has been estimated to be @xmath834 at the time of the qcd phase transition and with typical scale of the order of the meter at the same epoch .    in @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out that , probably , the magnetic fields generated at the time of qcd phase transition may be much stronger than the ones estimated in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite argue that strong magnetic fields may be generated when the broken and symmetric phase of the theory coexist .",
    "the magnetic fields generated at the boundaries between quark and hadron phases can be , according to the authors , as large as @xmath835 g over scales of the order of the meter at the time of the qcd phase transition .",
    "recently , in a series of papers , boyanovsky , de vega and simionato @xcite studied the generation of large scale magnetic fields during a phase transition taking place in the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "the setting is a theory of @xmath836 charged scalar fields coupled to an abelian gauge field that undergoes a phase transition at a critical temperature much larger than the electroweak scale . using non - equilibrium field theory techniques",
    "the authors argue that during the scaling regime ( when the back - reaction effects are dominant ) large scale magnetogenesis is possible .",
    "the claim is that the minimal dynamo requirement of eq .",
    "( [ dyn ] ) is achievable at the electroweak scale .",
    "furthermore , much larger magnetic fields can be expected if the scaling regime can be extended below the qcd scale .      from the above discussion",
    "it is apparent that the mechanisms producing magnetic fields at some moment in the life of the universe ( and inside the hubble radius ) have to justify the large correlation scale of the magnetic seeds required by subsequent mhd considerations .",
    "the possibility of turbulent behaviour in the early universe , even though physically justified , seems to be difficult to quantify even if rather reasonable quantitative estimates appeared so far . on the other hand",
    ", inflationary scenarios can lead to magnetic seeds with large correlation scale .    a useful point to be stressed",
    "is that there may exist `` mixed '' mechanisms . consider the following example which has been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "suppose that during the inflationary phase a stochastic background of gauge fields is produced thanks to the breaking of conformal invariance .",
    "the spectral amplitude of the generated field will be constrained by the critical density bound and by all the other dynamical considerations related to the finite values of the diffusion scales .",
    "the generated magnetic field spectrum will be distributed over a large interval of frequencies . in particular",
    ", the energy spectrum of the magnetic field will be non negligible at some intermediate scale , like , for instance , the electroweak scale , i.e. the physical frequency @xmath837 .",
    "in other words , if magnetic fields are generated thanks to some inflationary mechanism , the amplified magnetic inhomogeneities will be reentering at different epochs during the radiation dominated phase and the scales which left the horizon later during inflation will reenter earlier .    given the background of abelian gauge fields",
    ", the dynamics of the electroweak epoch may add interesting physical features .",
    "for instance the magnetic field of inflationary origin will be , as discussed , topologicaly trivial : its magnetic gyrotropy will vanish .",
    "however , during the ew epoch , thanks to a pseudoscalar vertex due either to a pseudo goldstone boson or to the chemical pootential , the topologically trivial hypermagnetic background may be turned into a topologically non - trivial background and large magnetic helicity may be generated .",
    "in the context of various mechanisms , the magnetic fields generated at large at the scale of the protogalactic collapse may be rather small . in this section",
    "the possible effects of magnetic present over much smaller length - scales will be analyzed .",
    "two important scales are the hubble radius at the electroweak epoch and at the big - bang nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "hypermagnetic fields present for temperatures @xmath838 have a twofold effect :    * they may affect the phase diagram of the electroweak theory ; * they may offer a mechanism to seed the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "the physical picture of the possible effects of magnetic fields on the electroweak phase diagram is exactly the same as the macroscopic description of superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the normal - superconducting phase transition , being of second order in the absence of magnetic fields , becomes of first order if a magnetic field is present .",
    "the reason for this is the meissner effect , i.e. the fact that the magnetic field can not propagate inside a superconducting cavity , and , therefore , creates an extra pressure acting on the normal - superconducting boundary .",
    "our consideration below explores this simple picture .",
    "consider the plain domain wall that separates broken and symmetric phase at some temperature @xmath605 , in the presence of a uniform hypercharge magnetic field @xmath839 .",
    "far from the domain wall , in the symmetric phase , the non - abelian su(2 ) field strength ( @xmath840 ) is equal to zero , because of a non - perturbative mass gap generation . inside the broken phase , the massive @xmath841 combination of @xmath839 and @xmath842",
    ", @xmath843 must be equal to zero , while the massless combination , corresponding to photon @xmath844 , survives .",
    "the matching of the fields on the boundary gives @xmath845 .",
    "thus , an extra pressure @xmath846 acts on the domain wall from the symmetric side . at the critical temperature it must be compensated by the vacuum pressure of the scalar field .",
    "if we neglect loop corrections associated with the presence of magnetic fields , then the condition that determines the critical temperature is : @xmath847 where @xmath848 is the effective potential in the absence of magnetic field , @xmath849 is the location of the minimum of the potential at temperature @xmath605 .",
    "the above consideration was dealing with the uniform magnetic fields .",
    "clearly , it remains valid when the typical distance scale of inhomogeneities of the magnetic field are larger than the typical bubble size .",
    "this is the case for bubbles smaller than the magnetic diffusion scale , and , in particular , at the onset of the bubble nucleation .",
    "thus , the estimate of the critical temperature coming from ( [ pressure ] ) is applicable . for bubbles larger than the diffusivity scale",
    ", the presence of a stochastic magnetic field will considerably modify their evolution .",
    "in particular , the spherical form of the bubbles is very likely to be spoiled .",
    "these considerations were presented in @xcite . later @xcite perturbative estimates were performed in order to corroborate the proposed picture . in @xcite",
    "a full non - perturbative analysis of the phhase diagram of the electroweak theory in the presence of an hyermagnetic background has been performed . as previously discussed @xcite for values of the higggs boson mass larger than the w boson mass the electroweak phase diagram seems to exhibit a cross - over regime .",
    "the inclusion of a constant hypermagnetic background with typical strength @xmath850 does modify the electroweak phase diagram but does not seem to make the phase transition strongly first order for @xmath851 as expected from perturbative considerations .",
    "furthermore for @xmath852 ( but still compatible with the critical density bound ) a new ( inhomogeneous ) phase has been observed .",
    "the analysis performed in @xcite included a net hypermagnetic flux .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat the same calculation in the presence of a non - vanishing hypermagnetic helicity ( or gyrotropy ) .",
    "depending upon the topology of the flux lines , hypermagnetic fields can have two distinct effects :    * topologically non - trivial configurations of the hypermagnetic flux lines lead to the formation of hypermagnetic knots whose decay might seed the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) ; * even if the electrowak plasma has vanishing hypermagnetic gyrotropy , i.e. @xmath853 , matter  antimatter fluctuations may be generated .",
    "consider first the situation where the electroweak plasma contains , for @xmath854 a network of hypermagnetic knots of the type of the ones described in eqs .",
    "( [ conf1])([knot ] ) . in section 5",
    "these configurations have been named hypermagnetic knots ( hk ) and they are chern - simons condensates carrying a non - vanishing ( averaged ) hypermagnetic helicity . as discussed , hk can be dynamically generated from a background of hypermagnetic fields with trivial topology provided a ( time - dependent ) pseudo - scalar is present in the plasma ( see , for instance , eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) ) .    in order to seed the bau a network of hk should be present at high temperatures .",
    "in fact for temperatures larger than @xmath855 the fermionic number is stored both in hk and in real fermions . for @xmath856 , the hk should release real fermions since the ordinary magnetic fields ( present _ after _ ew symmetry breaking ) do not carry fermionic number . if the ewpt is strongly first order the decay of the hk can offer some seeds for the bau generation .",
    "this last condition can be met in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the integration of the @xmath647 anomaly equation gives the cs number density carried by the hk which is in turn related to the density of baryonic number @xmath857 for the case of @xmath612 fermionic generations .",
    "in fact , using eqs .",
    "( [ nr])([ohm ] ) and after some algebra @xcite it can be shown that @xmath858 ( @xmath601 is the @xmath647 coupling and @xmath859 is the entropy density ; @xmath316 , at @xmath855 , is @xmath860 in the msm ; @xmath861 ) . in eq .",
    "( [ bau ] ) @xmath633 is the perturbative rate of the right electron chirality flip processes ( i.e. scattering of right electrons with the higgs and gauge bosons and with the top quarks because of their large yukawa coupling ) which are the slowest reactions in the plasma and @xmath862 is the rate of right electron dilution induced by the presence of a hypermagnetic field . in the msm we have",
    "that @xmath863 whereas in the mssm @xmath633 can naturally be larger than @xmath864 . unfortunately , in the msm a hypermagnetic field can modify the phase diagram of the phase transition but can not make the phase transition strongly first order for large masses of the higgs boson .",
    "therefore , we will concentrate on the case @xmath865 and we will show that in the opposite limit the bau will be anyway small even if some ( presently unknown ) mechanism would make the ewpt strongly first order in the msm .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , in this scenario , the value of the bau is determined by various particle physics parameters but also by the ratio of the hypermagnetic energy density over the energy density sitting in radiation during the electroweak epoch .",
    "consider now the complementary situation where the electroweak plasma , for @xmath866 , is filled with topologically trivial hypermagnetic fields . in this case , fluctuations in the baryon to entropy ratio will be induced since , in any case @xmath867 .",
    "these fluctuations are of _ isocurvature _ type and can be related to the spectrum of hypermagnetic fields at the ewpt . defining as @xmath868 the fluctuations in the ratio of baryon number density @xmath857 to the entropy density @xmath869 at @xmath870 @xcite , the value of @xmath871 can be related to the hypermagnetic spectrum which is determined in terms of its amplitude @xmath872 and its slope @xmath770 .",
    "a physically realistic situation corresponds to the case in which the green s functions of the magnetic hypercharge fields decay at large distance ( i. e. @xmath873 ) and this would imply either `` blue '' ( @xmath874 ) or `` violet '' ( @xmath875 ) energy spectra .",
    "the fluctuations of the baryon to entropy ratio generated at the electroweak epoch may survive until the bbn epoch @xcite . the possibility of survival of these fluctuations is related to their typical scale which must exceed the neutron diffusion scale appropriately blue - shifted at the electroweak epoch .",
    "the implications of these fluctuations will be discussed in a moment .",
    "large scale magnetic fields possibly present at the bbn epoch can have an impact on the light nuclei formation . by reversing the argument ,",
    "the success of bbn can be used in order to bound the magnetic energy density possibly present at the time of formation of light nuclei .",
    "magnetic fields , at the bbn epoch may have four distinct effects :    * they can enhance the rate of the universe expansion at the corresponding epoch in a way proportional to @xmath876 ; * they can affect the reaction rate in a way proportional to @xmath877 ; * they can affect the phase space of the electrons ; * they can induce , prior to the formation of the light nuclei , matter  antimatter fluctuations .    while the first three effects are direct , the fourth effect is mainly caused by hypermagnetic fields present even before bbn .",
    "the idea that magnetic fields may increase the universe expansion and , consequently , affect directly the abundance of @xmath878 ( which is directly sensitive to the expansion rate ) has been pointed out long ago by greenstein @xcite and by matese and oconnel @xcite . from a qualitative point of view the effects over the expansion should be leading in comparison with the effects over the rate of interactions ( which are suppressed by @xmath879 ) .",
    "thanks to detailed numerical simulations performed indipendently by different groups ( i.e. cheng et al .",
    "@xcite ; kernan , starkman and vachaspati @xcite ; grasso and rubinstein @xcite ) , the common opinion is that the universe expansion is the leading effect even if this conclusion has been reached only recently and not without some disagreements on the details of the calculations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in order to prevent the universe from expanding too fast at the bbn epoch @xmath880 where @xmath881 is the energy density contributed by the standard three light neutrinos with masses much smaller than the mev .",
    "the bbn bound is physically relevant in many situations since it is a bit more constraining than the critical density bound .",
    "the bbn bounds discussed so far are derived assuming a stochastic magnetic field at the bbn epoch .",
    "this means that the isotropy of the geometry is not affected .",
    "however , it is not unreasonable to think of the possibility that a magnetic field with a preferred direction may break the isotropy of the background",
    ". thus bounds on the isotropy of the expansion at the bbn epoch may be turned into bounds on the shear induced by the presence of a magnetic field ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let us now come to the last point .",
    "the matter ",
    "antimatter fluctuations created at the electroweak epoch thanks to the presence of hypermagnetic fields may survive down to the epoch of bbn . since the fluctuations in the baryon",
    "to entropy ratio are , in general , not positive definite , they will induce fluctuations in the baryon to photon ratio , at the bbn epoch .",
    "the possible effect of matter ",
    "antimatter fluctuations on bbn depends on the typical scale of of the baryon to entropy ratio at the electroweak epoch . recalling that for @xmath882 gev the size of the electrowek horizon is approximately @xmath883 cm , fluctuations",
    "whose scale is well inside the ew horizon at @xmath855 have dissipated by the bbn time through ( anti)neutron diffusion .",
    "the neutron diffusion scale at @xmath855 is @xmath884 the neutron diffusion scale at @xmath885 is @xmath461 m , while , today it is @xmath208 pc , i.e. of the order of the astronomical unit .",
    "antimatter fluctuations smaller than @xmath461 m annihilate before neutrino decoupling and have no effect on bbn .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     two possibilities can then be envisaged .",
    "we could require that the matter ",
    "antimatter fluctuations ( for scales @xmath886 ) are small .",
    "this will then imply a bound , in the ( @xmath872,@xmath770 ) plane on the strength of the hypermagnetic background . in fig .",

    "finally with the dot - dashed line the critical density bound is illustrated for the same hypermagnetic background .     for @xmath888 ( full line).,height=240 ]",
    "the second possibility is to study the effects of large matter",
    " matter domains .",
    "these studies led to a slightly different scenario of bbn @xcite , namely bbn with matter ",
    "antimatter regions .",
    "this analysis has been performed in a series of papers by rehm and jedamzik @xcite and by kurki - suonio and sihvola @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is to discuss bbn in the presence of spherically symmetric regions of anti ",
    "matter characterized by their radius @xmath889 and by the parameter @xmath767 , i.e. the matter / antimatter ratio .",
    "furthermore , in this scenario the net baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath890 , is positive definite and non zero .",
    "antimatter domains larger than @xmath461 m at @xmath278 kev may survive until bbn and their dissipation has been analyzed in detail @xcite .",
    "antimatter domains in the range @xmath891 at 1 kev annihilate before bbn for temperatures between 70 kev and @xmath278 mev .",
    "since the antineutrons annihilate on neutrons , the neutron to proton ratio gets smaller . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath10 abundance gets reduced if compared to the standard bbn scenario .",
    "the maximal scale of matter ",
    "antimatter fluctuations is determined by the constraints following from possible distortions of the cmb spectrum .",
    "the largest scale is of the order of @xmath71 pc ( today ) , corresponding to @xmath5 m at @xmath278 kev .",
    "yield is illustrated in the @xmath892 plane for @xmath893 .",
    "as the matter / antimatter ratio decreases , we recover the standard @xmath10 yield.,height=240 ]    suppose that matter ",
    "antimatter regions are present in the range of eq .",

    "then the abundance of @xmath10 get reduced .",
    "the yield of @xmath878 are reported as a function of @xmath767 , the matter ",
    "antimatter ratio and @xmath889 .",
    "now , we do know that by adding extra - relativistic species the @xmath878 can be increased since the universe expansion gets larger .",
    "then the conclusion is that bbn with matter ",
    "antimatter domains allows for a larger number of extra - relativistic species if compared to the standard bbn scenario .",
    "this observation may have implications for the upper bounds on the stochastic gw backgrounds of cosmological origin @xcite since the extra - relativistic species present at the bbn epoch can indeed be interpreted as relic gravitons .",
    "the vacuum fluctuations of the gauge fields present during the inflationary stage of expansion may be amplified if conformal invariance is broken .",
    "it is then plausible that magnetic inhomogeneities are amplified not only at the scale of protogalactic collapse but also at larger length - scales .",
    "agnetic fields can be generated over all physical scales compatible large - scale magnetic fields may then have various interesting implications on the physics of the cmb and of its anisotropies .",
    "the following possible effects have been discussed through the years :    * distortion of the planckian spectrum ; * shift of the polarization plane ( provided the cmb is linearly polarized ) ; * shift in the position of the first doppler peak ; * generic increase of the amount of the ( primary ) anisotropy .    on top of these effects , magnetic fields can also modify the evolution of the tensor fluctuations of the geometry for typical length scales much smaller than the ones probed by cmb anisotropy experiments .    the possible distortions of the planckian spectrum of cmb are usually discussed in terms of a chemical potential which is bounded , by experimental data , to me @xmath894 . magnetic field dissipation at high red - shift implies the presence of a chemical potential .",
    "hence bounds on the distorsion of the planckian spectrum of the cmb can be turned into bounds on the magnetic field strength at various scales .",
    "in particular @xcite the obtained bound are such that @xmath895 g for comoving coherence lengths between @xmath896 kpc and @xmath897 kpc .",
    "large scale magnetic fields can also afffect the poosition of the doppler peak . in @xcite",
    "this analysis has been performed in a non - relativistic approximation where the scalar perturbations of the geometry obey linearized newtonian equations of motion .",
    "it has been found that , in this approximation , the effect of the presence of the magnetic fields is an effective renormalization of the speed of sound of the baryons .",
    "large scale magnetic fields present prior to the recombination epoch may act as a source term in the evolution equation of the cosmological perturbations .",
    "if magnetic fields are created over large length scales ( possibly even larger than the mpc ) it is rather plausible that they may be present after matter - radiation equality ( but before decoupling ) when primordial fluctuations are imprinted on the cmb anisotropies .",
    "in fact , the relevant modes determining the large scale temperature anisotropies are the ones that are outside the horizon for @xmath898 where @xmath899 and @xmath900 are , respectively , the equality and the decoupling times .",
    "after equality there are two complementary approaches which can be used in order to address phenomenological implications of large scale magnetic fields :    * large scale magnetic fields are completely _ homogeneous _ outside the horizon after equality ; * large scale magnetic fields are _ inhomogeneous _ after equality .",
    "the idea that _ homogeneous _ magnetic fields may affect the cmb anisotropies was originally pointed out by zeldovich @xcite and further scrutinized by grishchuk , doroshkevich and novikov @xcite .",
    "since this idea implies that large - scale magnetic fields are weakly gravitating the details of the discussion ( and of the possible generalization of this idea ) will be postponed to the following section .",
    "the suggestion that _ inhomogeneous _ magnetic fields created during inflation may affect the cmb anisotropies was originally proposed in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was noticed that large scale magnetic fields produced during inflation may also lead to large fluctuations for modes which are outside the horizon after equality . in @xcite",
    "it was noticed that either the produced magnetic fields may be used to seed directly the cmb anisotropies , or , in a complementary persepective , the cmb data can be used to put constraints on the production mechanism .",
    "if large - scale magnetic fields are inhomogeneous , their energy momentum tensor will have , in general terms , scalar , vector and tensor modes @xmath901 which are decoupled and which act as source terms for the scalar , vector and tensor modes of the geometry @xmath902 whose gauge - invariant description is well explored @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the scalar component of large scale magnetic fields should be responsible , according to the suggestion of @xcite , of the large scale temperature anisotropies .",
    "the direct seeding of large - scale temperature anisotropies seems unlikely .",
    "in fact , the spectrum of large scale gauge fields leading to plausible values of the magnetic energy density over the scale of protogalactic collapse is typically smaller than the value required by experimental data .",
    "however , even if the primordial spectrum of magnetic fields would be tailored in an appropriate way , the initial conditions for the plasma evolution compatible with the presence of a sizable ( but undercritical ) magnetic field are of _ isocurvature _ type @xcite .    in order to illustrate this point consider the evolution equations for the gauge - invariant system of scalar perturbations of the geometry expressed in terms of the two bardeen potential @xmath477 and @xmath903 corresponding , in the newtonian gauge , to the fluctuations of the temporal and spatial component of the metric @xcite .",

    ".      large scale magnetic fields present at the decoupling epoch can also depolarize cmb @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the cmb represents a very interesting observable which has been extensively investigated in the past both from the theoretical @xcite and experimental points of view @xcite .",
    "forthcoming satellite missions like planck @xcite seem to be able to achieve a level of sensitivity which will enrich decisively our experimental knowledge of the cmb polarization with new direct measurements .    if the background geometry of the universe is homogeneous but not isotropic the cmb is naturally polarized @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon occurs , for example , in bianchi - type i models @xcite . on the other hand",
    "if the background geometry is homogeneous and isotropic ( like in the friedmann - robertson - walker case ) it seems very reasonable that the cmb acquires a small degree of linear polarization provided the radiation field has a non - vanishing quadrupole component at the moment of last scattering @xcite .    before decoupling photons ,",
    "baryons and electrons form a unique fluid which possesses only monopole and dipole moments , but not quadrupole .",
    "needless to say , in a homogeneous and isotropic model of frw type a possible source of linear polarization for the cmb becomes efficient only at the decoupling and therefore a small degree of linear polarization seems a firmly established theoretical option which will be ( hopefully ) subjected to direct tests in the near future .",
    "the linear polarization of the cmb is a very promising laboratory in order to directly probe the speculated existence of a large scale magnetic field ( coherent over the horizon size at the decoupling ) which might actually rotate ( through the faraday effect ) the polarization plane of the cmb .",

    "( [ faraday2 ] ) that if @xmath958 the expected rotation in the polarization plane of the cmb is non negligible .",
    "even if we are not interested , at this level , in a precise estimate of @xmath952 , we point out that more refined determinations of the expected faraday rotation signal ( for an incident frequency @xmath959 ) were recently carried out @xcite leading to a result fairly consistent with ( [ faraday1 ] ) .",
    "then , the statement is the following . _",
    "if _ the cmb is linearly polarized and _ if _ a large scale magnetic field is present at the decoupling epoch , _ then _ the polarization plane of the cmb can be rotated @xcite .",
    "the predictions of different models can then be confronted with the requirements coming from a possible detection of depolarization of the cmb @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields can source the evolution equations of the fluctuations of the geometry also over length - scales much smaller than the ones where cmb anisotropy experiments are conduced .",

    ".    there is , at the moment , no compelling reason why large - scale magnetic fields should not be primordial , at least to some degree :    * in the early universe magnetic fields are easily produced during phase transitions but their typical correlation scales are small ; * inflation greatly helps in producing correlations over very large scales and the ( early ) variation of gauge couplings during the inflationary phase allows the generation of intense large - scale fields ; * primordial magnetic fields may have an impact on the thermodynamical history of the universe , but , in practice , the obtained constraints improve only marginally , in various interesting cases , the critical density bound imposed on the magnetic energy density ; * if magnetic fields are generated during phase transitions , a growth in their correlation scale can not be excluded because of turbulent phenomena whose existence can be reasonably expected ( but not firmly predicted ) on the basis of our terrestrial knowledge of magnetized plasmas .    in the next decade a progress of the empirical knowledge is expected in apparently unrelated areas like @xmath989 and @xmath1022-ray astronomy , radio - astronomy , cmb physics , detection of relic gravitational waves .",
