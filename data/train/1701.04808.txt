    "weak ( local ) values were first considered by landau @xcite and london @xcite in connection with superfluids . as these values were not eigenvalues of the system and could not be measured in the usual way , they were not pursued .",
    "however hirschfelder @xcite subsequently realised the importance of local values , discussing them in terms of what he called  subobservables \" .",
    "moreover , dirac @xcite had anticipated local values in his paper discussing non - commutative geometry in quantum mechanics .",
    "the idea of a weak measurement has a long history @xcite and was brought to prominence by aharonov , albert and vaidman ( aav ) @xcite when they suggested a procedure to measure the weak value of spin for a particle experimentally .",
    "while  local \" was the original name for these variables and is still used by some authors @xcite ,  weak \" has become popular in this context .",
    "although we believe  weak \" is misleading and can cause confusion with the electroweak force , we will continue to use it in the rest of this paper .",
    "weak values are complex , in contrast to eigenvalues that are only real .",
    "it must be clearly stated that the real part of the weak value is not to be identified as an eigenvalue .",
    "the experiment described here will show how both the real and imaginary parts of the weak value of spin may be observed .",
    "weak measurement can therefore reveal the more subtle details of quantum processes .",
    "measuring an eigenvalue uses a von neumann ( strong ) measurement @xcite .",
    "this is a single stage process whereby the wave function is said to  collapse \" .",
    "in contrast , the weak measurement process has three stages ; pre - selection , the weak stage and finally a strong stage ( post - selection ) .",
    "the real parts of the weak values for the polarisation and momentum of photons @xcite have been observed and measured .",
    "it should be noted that the theory of weak measurement was originally cast in the non - relativistic regime using schrdinger s equation ( schrdinger particles ) , whereas photons obey maxwell s equations and are relativistic .",
    "in contrast to the photon case , the real and imaginary parts of the weak value of spin for non - relativistic neutrons have also been measured @xcite ; we intend to do the same for non - relativistic helium atoms .",
    "we are following a scheme outlined in aav and by duck , stevenson and sudarshan @xcite which is a variant on the original stern - gerlach ( s - g ) apparatus @xcite .",
    "a simulation has been carried out giving firm predictions of what should be observed within the scope of the parameters set by our experiment .",
    "the weak measurement process allows for the detection of very small phase shifts . by preparing the system in a particular pre- and post - selected quantum state",
    ", it is possible to amplify these phase shifts so that they are more easily measurable . from this amplified signal ,",
    "it is possible to abstract the desired observable of interest . as a consequence of this effect",
    ", the phrase  weak value amplification \" is commonly used in the literature .",
    "this amplification is constrained by certain conditions and owing to the limits imposed , these amplified shifts are still relatively small .",
    "the three stages of the weak measurement regime for spin are as follows .",
    "atoms are first pre - selected in a desired spin state . in our case , we chose spin up at an angle @xmath3 in the x - z plane ( see fig.[fig : setup - of - themyex ] ) .",
    "the atoms then propagate through the weak stage , comprising an s - g magnet with an inhomogeneous magnetic field in the z - axis . here",
    "the field gradient is small , producing a small rotation of the spin vector .",
    "spin - up state enter from the left , with spin vector angle @xmath4 .",
    "the atoms pass through the weak and strong s - g magnets before eventually being incident on the detector .",
    "the displacement due to the weak measurement process is @xmath5 . for simplicity the azimuthal angle @xmath6 in the x - y plane",
    "is not shown.,width=5 ]    .",
    "the strong stage consists of a second s - g magnet , with its inhomogeneous magnetic field aligned along the x - axis ( see fig.[fig : setup - of - themyex ] ) .",
    "this field is large enough to separate the spin eigenstates on this axis .",
    "it is this separation that enables us to detect the small phase shift , proportional to @xmath5 , induced by the weak stage as shown in the figure .",
    "the size of @xmath5 depends on various features of the apparatus .",
    "furthermore , since this new shift is still relatively small , we must maximise it by suitably adjusting the experimental parameters as will be investigated below .",
    "we have chosen to work with helium , excited into a metastable @xmath0 triplet state .",
    "this form of helium has several advantages .",
    "1 . its magnetic dipole moment has a magnitude of two bohr magnetons @xcite .",
    "this maximises the displacements produced by the s - g magnets .",
    "2 . it has a lifetime of approximately 8000s @xcite , being unable to decay via electric dipole transitions and the pauli exclusion principle ( i.e. , its decay is doubly forbidden ) .",
    "this half - life provides sufficient time for the atoms to pass through all the stages of the apparatus before decaying .",
    "3 . metastable helium atoms have an internal energy of 19.6ev , the highest of any metastable noble gas species . upon collision with any surface",
    ", it will ionise with ease , allowing for detection with charged particle detectors .",
    "all of these characteristics will enhance the overall signal strength and sensitivity of the experiment .",
    "our experimental arrangement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : design_vincenzo_jan2016 ] . helium gas at high pressure enters the apparatus from the left and is pulsed using an electromagnetic valve producing a supersonic beam .",
    "the atomic beam is excited via an electron seeded discharge , where the atoms collide with a stream of energetic electrons in a 300v / cm electric field @xcite .",
    "the excited gas then passes through a @xmath7 diameter skimmer and travels between two electrically charged plates to remove residual ionised atoms and free electrons .",
    "a hexapole magnet focuses the @xmath8 state to a point along the axis of propagation , defocusing the @xmath9 state .",
    "the @xmath10 state is left untouched .",
    "the @xmath8 spin state is focused onto a second skimmer , producing an atomic beam with width @xmath11 .    from this point",
    "onwards the apparatus is enclosed in a mu - metal shield to nullify the effects of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "using helmholtz coils , the magnetic spin axis of the atoms is set at the angle @xmath4 before entering the weak stage ; the homogeneous magnetic field is aligned perpendicular to the atoms direction of travel . upon exiting of the strong stage , the atomic beam propagates freely onto a detector that consists of two micro - channel plates in a chevron configuration , coupled to a phosphor screen and ccd camera .",
    "the measured deflection @xmath5 will be proportional to the weak value of the atomic spin .",
    "since the displacement @xmath5 is very small , it is important to reduce vibrations in the final stages of the apparatus . to this end ,",
    "two optical benches are used which are isolated by edge welded bellows ; the first bench utilises turbo pumps in order to maintain adequate vacuum in the source chamber .",
    "the second , containing the preparation and detection chambers , employs zero vibration ion pumps .",
    "the simulation is divided into three parts ; the initial conditions , the application of the interaction hamiltonian using the impulsive approximation @xcite , and the free evolution of the post - selected spin state .",
    "this approximation neglects the free evolution of the atoms in the weak magnet , only the interaction hamiltonian is considered .",
    "it is also important to note that the inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by the s - g magnet in the weak stage is maximal along the z - axis , but negligible along the other two axes .",
    "the analysis follows the scheme outlined in @xcite , but in our case we are using the spin-1 , @xmath0 , metastable form of helium .",
    "the helium atoms contain the @xmath10 spin state , but this is unaffected by inhomogeneous magnetic fields , passing through the experiment unhindered .",
    "the helium gas is initially prepared as a pulsed beam and is described by the normalised gaussian wave packet at time @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the width in position space .",
    "recall , before the atomic beam is sent through the weak stage , it is spin selected via a hexapole magnet .",
    "shortly after , a pair of helmholtz coils are used to set the pre - selected angle of spin @xmath3 within the x - z plane .",
    "we describe the resulting spinor in terms of polar angles @xmath3 , and @xmath15 , in the following form @xcite    @xmath16=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } c_{\\rm + } \\\\ c_{\\rm0}\\\\ c_{\\rm- } \\end{array}\\right].\\label{eq : si}\\ ] ]    the initial orientation of the spin vector angle @xmath3 can be seen in fig.[fig : setup - of - themyex ] , where the azimuthal angle @xmath15 ( not shown ) , is the corresponding angle in the x - y plane . angles @xmath4 and @xmath15 can be changed by rotating the helmholtz coils about the y and x - axes respectively .",
    "therefore the initial wave function prior to entering the weak stage is    @xmath17    the width of the atomic beam is set by passing it through an orifice / skimmer at the entrance of the weak stage .",
    "the atoms then traverse the weak stage magnet , where the wave function evolves under the interaction hamiltonian , weakly coupling the spin and centre - of - mass wave functions .",
