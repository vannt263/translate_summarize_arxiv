    ", we have considered supernovae with the explosion energies of @xmath7 1 - 1.5 @xmath8 10@xmath9 ergs .",
    "these energies have been best estimated from sne 1987a , 1993j , and 1994i , whose progenitors masses have been estimated to be 13 - 20 @xmath6 ( e.g. , nomoto et al . 1993 , 1994 ; blinnikov et al .",

    "1998 ; woosley et al . 1999 ) , and sn ic 1997ef ( iwamoto et al .",
    "2000 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2000 ) have been found to have such a large kinetic explosion energy as @xmath10 erg .",
    "this is more than one order of magnitude larger than typical sne , so that these objects may be called `` hypernovae '' .",
    "these sne produced more @xmath11ni than the average core collapse sn .",
    "their progenitors masses are estimated to be @xmath12 .",
    "these massive stars are likely to form black holes , while less massive stars form neutron stars ( see , however , wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we investigate the characteristics of nucleosynthesis in such energetic core - collapse hypernovae , the systematic study of which has not yet been done .",
    "we examine both spherical and aspherical explosion models and discuss their contributions to the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "in core - collapse supernovae / hypernovae , stellar material undergoes shock heating and subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "iron - peak elements are produced in two distinct regions , which are characterized by the peak temperature , @xmath13 , of the shocked material . for @xmath14k",
    ", material undergoes complete si burning whose products include co , zn , v , and some cr after radioactive decays . for @xmath15k @xmath16k ,",
    "incomplete si burning takes place and its after decay products include cr and mn ( e.g. , hashimoto et al .",
    "1989 ; woosley , & weaver 1995 ; thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "we note the following characteristics of nucleosynthesis with very large explosion energies ( nomoto et al .",
    "2001 ) :    \\1 ) both complete and incomplete si - burning regions shift outward in mass compared with normal supernovae , so that the mass ratio between the complete and incomplete si - burning regions becomes larger . as a result , higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [ ( zn , co)/fe ] , smaller [ ( mn , cr)/fe ] , and larger [ fe / o ] . the elements synthesized in this region such as @xmath11ni , @xmath17cu , @xmath18zn , and @xmath4ge ( which decay into @xmath11co , @xmath17co , @xmath18cu , and @xmath4zn , respectively ) are ejected more abundantly than in normal supernovae .",
    "\\2 ) in the complete si - burning region of hypernovae , elements produced by @xmath1-rich freezeout are enhanced because nucleosynthesis proceeds at lower densities ( i.e. , higher entropy ) and thus a larger amount of @xmath19he is left .",
    "hence , elements synthesized through capturing of @xmath1-particles , such as @xmath2ti , @xmath3cr , and @xmath4ge ( decaying into @xmath2ca , @xmath3ti , and @xmath4zn , respectively ) are more abundant .",
    "\\3 ) oxygen burning takes place in more extended , lower density regions for the larger explosion energy .",
    "therefore , more o , c , al are burned to produce a larger amount of burning products such as si , s , and ar .",
    "therefore , hypernova nucleosynthesis is characterized by large abundance ratios of [ si / o ] , [ s / o ] , [ ti / o ] , and [ ca / o ] .",
    "nakamura et al . ( 2001a ) and mazzali et al . (",
    "2001 ) have identified some signatures of asymmetric explosion in the late light curve and spectra of sn 1998bw .",
    "maeda et al . ( 2002 ) have examined the effect of aspherical ( jet - like ) explosions on nucleosynthesis in hypernovae .",
    "the progenitor model is the 16 @xmath6 he core of the 40 @xmath6 star and the explosion energy is @xmath20 = 1 @xmath8 10@xmath21 ergs .",
    "+    figure 1 shows the isotopic composition of the ejecta of asymmetric explosion model in the direction of the jet ( upper panel ) and perpendicular to it ( lower panel ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the 2d distribution of @xmath11ni and @xmath22o in the homologous expansion phase .    in the @xmath23-direction , where the ejecta carry more kinetic energy , the shock is stronger and post - shock temperatures are higher",
    "therefore , larger amounts of @xmath1-rich freeze - out elements , such as @xmath24he , @xmath2ti , and @xmath11ni are produced in the @xmath23-direction than in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "on the other hand , along the @xmath25-direction @xmath11ni is produced only in the deepest layers , and the elements ejected in this direction are mostly the products of hydrostatic nuclear burning stages ( o ) with some explosive oxygen - burning products ( si , s , etc ) .    in the spherical case , zn is produced only in the deepest layer , while in the aspherical model , the complete silicon burning region is elongated to the @xmath23 ( jet ) direction , so that [ zn / fe ] is enhanced irrespective of the mass cut . on the other hand , @xmath26mn , which is produced by incomplete silicon burning , surrounds @xmath11fe and located preferentially in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "in this way , larger asphericity in the explosion leads to larger [ zn / fe ] and [ co / fe ] , but to smaller [ mn / fe ] and [ cr / fe ] . then",
    ", if the degree of the asphericity tends to be larger for lower [ fe / h ] , the trends of [ zn , co , mn , cr / fe ] follow the ones observed in metal - poor stars , as discussed later .      in order to verify the observable consequences of an axisymmetric explosion , maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) calculated the profiles of the fe - dominated blend near 5200 , and of o i ] 6300 , 6363 .",
    "these are the lines that deviate most from the expectations from a spherically symmetric explosion ( mazzali et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the iron and oxygen profiles viewed at an angle of 15@xmath27 from the jet direction are found to be most consistent with the observed spectrum on day 139 in figure 2 . when the degree of asphericity is high and the viewing angle is close to the jet direction , the component iron lines in the blend have double - peaked profiles , the blue- and red - shifted peaks corresponding to fe - dominated matter moving towards and away from us , respectively .",
    "because of the high velocity of fe , the peaks are widely separated , making the blend wide .",
    "this is the case for the synthetic fe - blend shown in figure 2 .",
    "in contrast , the oxygen line is narrower and has a sharper peak , because o is produced mostly in the @xmath25-direction , at lower velocities and with a less aspherical distribution .",
    "the abundance pattern of metal - poor stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath28 provides us with very important information on the formation , evolution , and explosions of massive stars in the early evolution of the galaxy .    in the early galactic epoch when the galaxy is not yet chemically well - mixed , [ fe / h ] may well be determined by mostly a single sn event ( audouze & silk 1995 ) .",
    "the formation of metal - poor stars is supposed to be driven by a supernova shock , so that [ fe / h ] is determined by the ejected fe mass and the amount of circumstellar hydrogen swept - up by the shock wave ( ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ) .",
    "then , hypernovae with larger @xmath20 are likely to induce the formation of stars with smaller [ fe / h ] , because the mass of interstellar hydrogen swept up by a hypernova is roughly proportional to @xmath20 ( ryan et al .",
    "1996 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) and the ratio of the ejected iron mass to @xmath20 is smaller for hypernovae than for canonical supernovae .",
    "the observed abundances of metal - poor halo stars show quite interesting pattern .",
    "there are significant differences between the abundance patterns in the iron - peak elements below and above [ fe / h]@xmath29 - @xmath30 .",
    "\\1 ) for [ fe / h]@xmath31 , the mean values of [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] decrease toward smaller metallicity , while [ co / fe ] increases ( mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; ryan et al . 1996 ) .",
    "\\2 ) [ zn / fe]@xmath32 for [ fe / h ] @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( sneden , gratton , & crocker 1991 ) , while at [ fe / h ] @xmath35 , [ zn / fe ] increases toward smaller metallicity ( figure 3 ; primas et al . 2000 ; blake et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "these trends can not be explained with the conventional chemical evolution model that uses previous nucleosynthesis yields .",
    "the larger [ ( zn , co)/fe ] and smaller [ ( mn , cr)/fe ] in the supernova ejecta can be realized if the mass ratio between the complete si burning region and the incomplete si burning region is larger , or equivalently if deep material from complete si - burning region is ejected by mixing or aspherical effects .",
    "this can be realized if ( 1 ) the mass cut between the ejecta and the collapsed star is located at smaller @xmath36 ( nakamura et al .",
    "1999 ) , ( 2 ) @xmath20 is larger to move the outer edge of the complete si burning region to larger @xmath36 ( nakamura et al .",
    "2001b ) , or ( 3 ) asphericity in the explosion is larger .",
    "also a large explosion energy @xmath20 results in the enhancement of the local mass fractions of zn and co , while cr and mn are not enhanced ( umeda & nomoto 2001 ) . therefore , if hypernovae made significant contributions to the early galactic chemical evolution , it could explain the large zn and co abundances and the small mn and cr abundances observed in very metal - poor stars .    the dependence of [ zn / fe ] on @xmath37 and @xmath20 is summarized in figure 3 .",
    "models with @xmath38ergs do not produce sufficiently large [ zn / fe ] . to be compatible with the observations of [ zn / fe ] @xmath39 , the explosion energy must be much larger , i.e. , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , i.e. , hypernova - like explosions of massive stars ( @xmath12 ) with @xmath42 are responsible for the production of zn .    [",
    "[ ni ] ] ni ~~    the observed trend of another iron - peak element , ni , is also interesting . unlike the elements we have focused on , [ ni / fe ] of metal - poor stars shows no clear trend ( see e.g. , ryan et al . 1996 ; nakamura et al .",
    "theoretically , this is understood as the fact that ni is produced abundantly by both complete and incomplete si - burning .",
    "recently , elliison et al . (",
    "2001 ) observed dla abundance and found [ co / fe ] @xmath43 , which is similar to the metal - poor halo stars .",
    "they , on the other hand , did not find oversolar [ ni / fe ] .",
    "similar results have also been found by norris et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who observed abundances of five halo stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath44 .",
    "they discussed that the results are inconsistent with the predictions of nakamura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , where the enhancement of [ co / fe ] appears to be accompanied by the enhancement of [ ni / fe ] .",
    "we note that the increase in [ ni / fe ] along with the increase in [ co / fe ] is not significant in the hypernova models by umeda & nomoto ( 2001 ) ; for example , co / fe in the hypernova is larger by a factor of 17 than a normal sn ii , while ni is larger only by a factor of 1.8 .",
    "the apparent difference from the results in nakamura et al .",
    "( 1999 ) can be understood as follows . in nakamura",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) , the explosion energy was fixed to be @xmath45 .",
    "they obtained the larger co / fe ratio for more massive sne ii by assuming `` deeper '' mass - cuts so that @xmath46 in the explosive burning region is smaller @xmath47 ) . for smaller @xmath46 , the co abundance is larger , but the abundance of ni ( especially @xmath48ni ) is enhanced by a larger factor than co. therefore , the increase in [ ni / fe ] with [ co / fe ] was unavoidable , unless neutrinos substantially enhance @xmath46 in the deep complete si burning region .    in umeda & nomoto models , mass - cuts of the larger co ( and zn ) models",
    "are not deeper in @xmath36 , and @xmath46 in the complete si burning region is not small .",
    "this is because they assume larger explosion energies for more massive stars , which shifts the mass - cut outwards in @xmath36 . as a result ,",
    "the dominant ni isotope is @xmath49ni . in our model , with increasing @xmath20 , the abundances of co and zn increase more than @xmath49ni .",
    "therefore , co and zn abundances can be enhanced without appreciable increase in the ni abundance . in this sense , the abundance trends of very metal - poor stars",
    "is better explained with hypernova models rather than the simple `` deep '' mass - cut models ( nakamura et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "one may wonder whether the abundance anomaly of iron - peak elements may be related to the peculiar imf of pop iii stars .",
    "it is quite likely that the imf of pop iii stars is different from that of pop i and ii stars , and that more massive stars are abundant for pop iii .",
    "nakamura & umemura ( 1999 ) discussed that the imf of pop iii and very low metal stars may have a peak at even larger masses , around @xmath50- few)@xmath51 . if @xmath52 , then these stars are likely to form black holes either without explosion or with energetic explosions .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of the latter case may not be so different from the models considered here .",
    "this might favor the scenario that invokes the hypernova - like explosions for large [ zn / fe ] .",
    "if stars are even more massive than @xmath53 , these stars become pair - instability sne ( pisne ) and their nucleosynthesis is different from core - collapse sne . in particular , pisne produce [ zn / fe ] @xmath54 , because in pisne , iron peak elements are mostly produced by incomplete si burning so that the mass fraction of complete si burning elements is much smaller than sne ii ( umeda & nomoto 2001 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that pisne are unlikely to produce a large enough zn / fe ratio to explain the observations .",
    "x - ray emissions from the starburst galaxy m82 were observed with asca and the abundances of several heavy elements were obtained ( tsuru et al .",
    "tsuru et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the overall metallicity of m82 is quite low , i.e. , o / h and fe / h are only 0.06 - 0.05 times solar , while si / h and s / h are @xmath5 0.40 - 0.47 times solar .",
    "this implies that the abundance ratios are peculiar , i.e. , the ratio o / fe is about solar , while the ratios of si and s relative to o and fe are as high as @xmath5 6 - 8 .",
    "these ratios are very different from those ratios in sne ii . compared with normal sne ii ,",
    "the important characteristic of hypernova nucleosynthesis is the large si / o , s / o , and fe / o ratios .",
    "figure 4 shows the good agreement between the hypernova model ( @xmath55 30 ) and the observed abundances in m82 .",
    "hypernovae could also produce larger @xmath20 per oxygen mass than normal sne ii , as required for m82 .",
    "we therefore suggest that hypernova explosions may make important contributions to the metal enrichment and energy input to the interstellar matter in m82 .",
    "the age of starburst activity is estimated to be @xmath56 years ( stickland 2001 ) , which is so young that only massive stars ( @xmath57 25 @xmath6 ) contributed to nucleosynthesis in m82 .",
    "the large [ fe / o ] observed in some metal - poor stars and galaxies might possibly be the indication of hypernovae rather than type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .    to distinguish between hypernova ( nakamura et al .",
    "2001b ; umeda & nomoto ) and sn ia ( iwamoto et al . 1999 ; nomoto et al .",

    "[ si / fe ] @xmath5 0.3 - 0.5 in hypernovae ; @xmath60 - 0 in sne ia .    to reproduce the solar abundance ratios with the combination of sn ii and sn i products",
    ", there exist certain constraints on the model abundances of sne ia .",
    "for example , [ si / fe ] @xmath5 0.3 in sne ii ( nomoto et al .",
    "1997a ) so that [ si / fe ] @xmath61 in sne ia ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) . for a system with a non - solar abundance pattern ,",
    "this constraint would be weaker .",
    "we have shown that signatures of hypernova nucleosynthesis are seen in the large [ ( ti , zn)/fe ] ratios in very metal poor stars and the large si / o and fe / o ratios in the starburst galaxy m82 .",
    "( see also the abundance pattern in x - ray nova sco ; israelian et al .",
    "1999 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "these properties of hypernova nucleosynthesis suggest that hypernovae of massive stars may make important contributions to the galactic ( and cosmic ) chemical evolution , especially in the early low metallicity phase",
