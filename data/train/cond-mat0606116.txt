    "the statistical theory of out - of - equilibrium systems is one of the most challenging , rapidly evolving , and an interdisciplinary domain of modern research .",
    "its fundamental importance is rooted in the fact that the majority of the situations encountered in nature ( in its broadest sense , including physical , chemical , and biological systems ) are nonequilibrium ones .",
    "such systems exhibit very complex and often counter - intuitive behaviors , resulting from a generic interplay between a large number of degrees of freedom , nonlinearities ,  noise \" or perturbations of various origins , driving forces and dissipation ( corresponding to various levels of coarse - grained description ) .",
    "usually , noise and stochastic equations appear in the modeling when one concentrates the study on a few relevant variables ( hereafter called  system under study \" ) and approximates the effects of the eliminated degrees of freedom through a  random force \" or  noise \" with prescribed statistical properties .",
    "in particular , these eliminated degrees of freedom have a characteristic time scale , that is translated into the specific correlation time of the noise that intends to mimic them .    in many situations of interest ,",
    "the characteristic response time of the system under study is much larger than this specific time scale of the eliminated variables . following the seminal works of einstein , langevin and smoluchowsky ,",
    "the noise is then safely modeled as a gaussian white noise ( gwn ) that is @xmath0-correlated in time . in this case",
    "the model system is generically referred to as a  brownian particle \" .",
    "the brownian motion under the action of the gwn is a wiener process , and a detailed mathematical analysis can be carried on the basis of langevin or fokker - planck equations .",
    "the wiener process and the gwn are , of course , stochastic processes of fundamental importance .",
    "however , they do not exhaust all the situations one may be called to model .",
    "indeed , there are cases when the eliminated degrees of freedom are _ slow _ on the time scale of the studied system . then one has to mimic the result of the coarse - graining over such a set of slow variables through a _ colored noise _ ,",
    "i.e. , a noise that has a non - negligible correlation time ( and thus a non - flat power spectrum ) .",
    "such noises have been studied in great detail in zero - dimensional systems , and their specific properties are known to have a profound influence on the behavior of these systems .",
    "generically , they lead the system out of equilibrium ( they break the detailed balance in the configuration space of the system ) .",
    "the effect of the color of the noise on noise - induced transitions and phase transitions continues to be documented , and has been found to be quite important , e.g. , it can alter the type of transition and lead to re - entrance phenomena .",
    "other noise - induced effects have also been found to be sensitive to the correlation time of the noise , like the stochastic resonance , the synchronization of several noisy dynamical units , and the directed transport in ratchets .",
    "the two most commonly discussed examples of colored noise are the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and the dichotomous markov noise ( dmn ) .",
    "although the ornstein - uhlenbeck process is easily invoked in view of doob s theorem  , the purpose of this review is to show that _ dmn has particular virtues and interest . _    but before proceeding with this argumentation , let us define the dmn and describe its main stochastic properties .",
    "the dmn @xmath1 is a very simple _ two - valued @xmath2 stochastic process , with constant transition rates @xmath3 between the two states _  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] illustrates a realization of dmn .",
    "+    the constancy of the transition rates corresponds to exponentially distributed waiting times @xmath4 in the two states , @xmath5 ( i.e. , the transitions are driven by poisson renewal processes ) and dmn is _",

    "we shall be exclusively concerned with _ stationary dmn _",
    ", for which the stationary probabilities of the two states are @xmath8 with the corresponding mean value @xmath9 moreover , we shall generally consider zero - mean dmn , @xmath10 , in order to avoid any systematic bias introduced by the noise in the dynamics of the driven system .",
    "the stationary temporal autocorrelation function of dmn is exponentially - decaying @xmath11 corresponding to a _",
    "finite correlation time _ @xmath12 and an  amplitude \" @xmath13 the power spectrum is thus a lorenzian related to the characteristic time scale @xmath12 , @xmath14 so the dmn is indeed _",
    "colored_.    a particular case of dmn , that will be widely used in the foregoing , is that of the _ symmetric _ dmn , for which @xmath15 and @xmath16 , so that the correlation time is @xmath17 , and the  amplitude \" @xmath18 , with , moreover , @xmath10 .",
    "let us underline yet another important property of the stationary , zero - mean dmn , namely that in appropriate limits it reduces either to a _ white shot noise _",
    "( wsn ) , or to a _ gaussian white noise _ ( gwn ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] represents schematically these relationships .",
    "+    consider the stationary _ asymmetric _ dmn of zero mean , characterized by _ three independent parameters _",
    "( e.g. , @xmath3 and @xmath19 ) , with @xmath20 .",
    "then , by taking the limit @xmath21 one recovers the wsn driven by a poisson process ( also called the campbell s process ) ; this one is characterized by _ two parameters _",
    "( @xmath22 and , e.g. , @xmath23 ) .",
    "considering further on the limit @xmath24 with @xmath25 but @xmath26 , wsn reduces to a gwn ; this latter is characterized by a _",
    "single parameter _ , the noise ",
    "amplitude \" @xmath27 .",
    "note also that the _ symmetric _ dmn can reduce directly ( i.e. , without passing through the stage of a wsn ) to the gwn by taking simultaneously the limits @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 represents the amplitude of the gwn .",
    "there is no mapping possible between dmn and the ornstein - uhlenbeck process : indeed , one can not eliminate the non - gaussian character of the dmn while keeping a finite correlation time .",
    "the two noises have distinct statistical properties , a point that is also generally reflected in the response properties of the dynamical systems driven by these noises .",
    "however , as indicated by the central limit theorem , the superposition of @xmath30 suitably - scaled , independent dmns @xmath31 , converges in the limit @xmath32 to an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "this property may be used to tackle systems driven by an ornstein - uhlenbeck noise ( that are notoriously difficult to study ) by constructing approximate solutions corresponding to the superposition of several dmns .",
    "this review is intended to present dmn as a _",
    "tool for modeling stochastic processes_. we shall thus try to clarify its applicability , flexibility , and limits , as well as to describe a few prototypical applications .",
    "several essential points , briefly resumed below , will be resulting from this review .    *",
    "as it will become clear , systems driven by dmn are _ encountered in a wide variety of physical and mathematical models_. besides the  fashion - effect \" ( peaked around the 1970s ) , there are deeper reasons to this and we shall address them .",
    "+ * a basic point is that _ dmn mimics the effects of finite correlation time ( colour ) of the noise in a very simple way_. it constitutes thus a good alternative to the widely - spread ornstein - uhlenbeck process , which is often quite untractable analytically .",
    "so , the dmn reflects the effect of the eliminated _ slow _ degrees of freedom on the dynamics of the relevant variables under study .",
    "refer for example to refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions on this essential point of the modeling of stochastic systems .",
    "+ moreover , the interplay between the _ intrinsic _ time scale of the dmn and other time scales present in the problem ( e.g. , characteristic relaxation time of the system under study , external periodic perturbations , etc . ) may lead to nontrivial effects ( e.g. , multistability and hysteretic behavior , stochastic resonance , synchronization effects , etc . ) .",
    "these effects are absent when a white noise is acting ( even multiplicatively ! ) on the system . +",
    "* one has to realize that _",
    "dmn may be directly a very good representation of a simple and frequently - encountered physical situation _",
    ", namely that of the _ thermally activated transitions between two configurations / states _ of a system ( as far as the  intra - configuration \" motion is unimportant , filtered - out or coarse - grained ) . + a very clear illustration",
    "is offered by the small electronic devices ( e.g. , mosfet , mim , jfet , point - contact resistances , etc . ) , as described in the review article ref .",
    "the active volume of such devices is so small that they contain only a reduced number of charge carriers ; then the alternate capture and emission of carriers at individual defect sites generates _ measurable _ discrete jumps in the device resistance .",
    "these jumps are naturally modeled as a dmn process .",
    "their study provides a powerful mean of investigating the nature of defects at the interfaces , the kinetics of carriers capture and emission ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent experimental example ) , and has demonstrated the defect origin of low - frequency @xmath33 noise in these devices , etc .",
    "+ * generically , dmn _ drives the system out - of - equilibrium _",
    "( i.e. , it breaks the detailed balance in the configuration space of the system ) .",
    "therefore it may lead to novel behaviors that are not accessible in equilibrium systems ( like , for example , directed transport out of microscopic fluctuations ) .",
    "in particular , memory effects may become important  the driven system is typically non - markovian . + * on one hand , dmn is  sufficiently simple \" so that it _ often allows for full analytical description _ , and it represents therefore a good research , as well as didactical tool",
    ". the emphasis of our presentation will thus be , to the largest possible extent , on _ analytically - solvable _ models and on _ exact results _ , as stated in the title of this review  .",
    "+ moreover , the  simplicity \" of dmn allows to dissect the essential mechanisms at work behind various nonequilibrium , often seemingly complex phenomena .",
    "one can thus reveal the  minimal scenario \" and ingredients for the appearance of these processes . + * on the other hand , dmn is  sufficiently rich \" so that it leads to _ highly nontrivial and varied nonequilibrium behaviors in nonlinear systems_. this illustrates once more the fundamental fact that stochasticity may affect the dynamics more strongly than just a simple perturbation around the deterministic evolution : it may induce _ qualitatively _ different behaviors . + * as it was mentioned above , dmn _ reduces , in appropriate limits , to wsn and to gwn _ , and thus offers an alternative way of solving problems connected with these noises ( in particular , master equation for dmn is often simpler to solve than the fokker - planck equation for gwn ) .",
    "+ let us also note that the relationship of dmn with the gwn played a role in the famous ( and unfounded  ! ) _ it versus stratonovich dilemma _  , see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for pertinent comments on this point .",
    "+ * from the point of view of numerical simulations , dmn has the advantage of _ being easy to implement as an external noise with finite support_. + * last , but surely not least , systems driven by dmn point to _ interesting practical applications_.      despite an impressive literature on the systems driven by dmn , the main lines and subjects of interest are easy to infer .",

    "we emphasized subjects that count amongst the most recent in this domain and in which we were directly involved .",
    "but , of course , all important earlier results are also described in detail , for the sake of a correct perspective on the field .",
    "a zero - dimensional dichotomous flow corresponds to the temporal evolution of some characteristic scalar variable @xmath34 of the system under study , whose velocity switches at random between two dynamics : the  + \" dynamics , @xmath35 , and the   \" dynamics , @xmath36 ( the dot designates the time - derivative ) .",

    "moreover , if not stated explicitely otherwise , we shall be working with a _ symmetric dmn _ , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    for the simplicity of the presentation",
    ", we shall often refer to @xmath45 as the  position of an overdamped particle \" ; but one should keep in mind that its actual nature depends on the system under study ( i.e. , that @xmath45 can be a spatial coordinate , a current , a concentration , a reaction coordinate , etc . ) .",
    "it is a stochastic process , and for most of the practical purposes its properties can be essentially described through the properties and evolution equation of the probability distribution function @xmath46  . indeed , one is in general interested by the the _ mean over the realizations of the dmn _ of an arbitrary function @xmath47 of the stochastic variable @xmath45 , a type of quantity that we shall denote throughout the text by @xmath48 : @xmath49 in the nonstationary regime of the dichotomous flow this is an explicit function of time , as discussed below .",
    "one is , of course , tempted to address first the question of the non - stationary , transient stochastic behavior of the variable @xmath45 , i.e. , that of the temporal evolution of its probability density from a given initial state ( a given initial probability distribution function ) to the ( presumably existent ) asymptotic stationary state with the corresponding stationary probability distribution function .      the master equation for the probability density of the compound ( or vectorial ) stochastic process @xmath50 $ ] , namely @xmath51 , can be easily written down .",

    "<S> nonequilibrium systems driven by additive or multiplicative dichotomous markov noise appear in a wide variety of physical and mathematical models . </S>",
    "<S> we review here some prototypical examples , with an emphasis on _ analytically - solvable _ situations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has escaped attention till recently that the standard results for the long - time properties of such systems can not be applied when unstable fixed points are crossed in the asymptotic regime . </S>",
    "<S> we show how calculations have to be modified to deal with these cases and present a few relevant applications  the hypersensitive transport , the rocking ratchet , and the stochastic stokes drift . </S>",
    "<S> these results reinforce the impression that dichotomous noise can be put on a par with gaussian white noise as far as obtaining analytical results is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> they convincingly illustrate the interplay between noise and nonlinearity in generating nontrivial behaviors of nonequilibrium systems and point to various practical applications . </S>"
