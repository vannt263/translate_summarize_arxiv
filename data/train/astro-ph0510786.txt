    "damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) are an excellent tool for probing structure formation in the early universe . by definition dlas",
    "are systems with neutral hydrogen column densities above @xmath9 , and for many years they have been linked to forming protogalaxies at high redshifts . with high resolution spectrography , dlas can shed light on physical processes and substructure within individual young galaxies .",
    "however , the exact nature of host absorbers has been debated for many years .    from metal - line kinematic analysis of absorption line widths and",
    "profile asymmetries @xcite concluded that the observed dla population can be best explained with a model in which absorption is caused by rapidly rotating ( @xmath10 ) cold thick ( @xmath11 ) disks which have already assembled at high redshifts , and ruled out the competing models in which dlas are small ( @xmath12 ) protogalaxies in the process of hierarchical merger .",
    "however , in most models of hierarchical structure formation it is extremely difficult to have an abundant population of such massive disks at @xmath13 .",
    "on the other hand , in the high - resolution ( 1 kpc spatial and @xmath14 mass resolution ) sph simulations of a small number of high - redshift galaxies @xcite showed that irregular protogalactic clumps with @xmath15 can reproduce the observed velocity width distribution and absorption profile asymmetries very well , without the need to invoke rapidly rotating massive disks . in their models",
    "large velocity widths are caused by a mixture of rotation , random motions , infall , and merging , and the resulting picture is fully consistent with most standard hierarchical structure formation scenarios . despite having achieved very high numerical resolution , this simulation features a small volume size ( 2 mpc ) and may not be representative of a typical dla absorber in the cosmological context .",
    "another shortcoming of @xcite paper is that their models do not include radiative transfer of the ultraviolet background ( uvb ) instead assuming simple self - shielding above a critical density , an assumption that directly affects the cross - section of dlas . in our paper",
    "we are going to address this issue in detail .",
    "simulations with larger volume sizes inherently suffer from inability to resolve the lower - mass part of the dla distribution .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of dlas in a 22.22 mpc ( comoving ) volume with sph simulations with dark matter mass resolution @xmath16 effectively meaning that only halos with masses above @xmath17 could be resolved .",
    "@xcite developed a method to account for absorption in halos below the numerical resolution of simulations .",
    "they used @xcite formalism to calculate the number density of unresolved halos and then convolved this distribution with the relation between the neutral hydrogen cross - section and halo circular velocity observed in their sph simulation to obtain the total abundance of dlas in a large simulation volume .",
    "we will return to the important question of dla cross - sectional dependence on the dark matter ( dm ) halo velocity dispersion further in this introduction .",
    "@xcite find that accounting for unresolved halos with this resolution correction increases the dla incident rate per unit redshift by about a factor of two bringing it closer to the observed value but still underpredicting the amount of lyman limit absorption by approximately a factor of 3 .",
    "@xcite used newer sph simulations and an improved technique to compute the contribution from unresolved halos and found that their dla incidence matches observations as long as they adopt a @xmath18 circular velocity cutoff ( corresponding to virial mass @xmath19 at @xmath1 ) below which halos can not host dla absorption systems , the value which is somewhat higher than the more traditional threshold @xmath20 for suppressing the formation of dwarf galaxies by a uv photoionization background @xcite .",
    "the highest dark matter mass resolution in these simulations is @xmath21 immediately suggesting that halos with masses below @xmath22 are not resolved which is very similar to the suggested cutoff .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite used semi - analytic models of galaxy formation to further investigate the hypothesis that multiple galactic clumps give rise to the observed kinematics and column density distributions .",
    "they studied several variants of the exponential disk model in which the sizes of individual galaxies are based on angular momentum conservation , noting that the resulting gaseous disks by themselves are too small to produce the observed kinematics and the overall number density of dlas .",
    "however , with a simple toy model they showed that a larger covering factor of the cold gas in these clumps can successfully reproduce the observed properties suggesting that lines of sight most likely go through tidal tails caused by mergers .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the dla cross - sections obtained from the sph simulations @xcite are not consistent with the observed velocity width @xmath23 distribution , in fact leading to too many low @xmath23 systems . on one hand",
    "one would need a sufficient number of these low - mass systems to match the total observed number density of dlas , on the other hand low - mass systems result in very small @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite suggested two possible solutions .",
    "one possibility is that the cross - sectional dependence on the halo mass does not hold below the resolution limit of @xcite where processes on sub - kpc scales ranging from various feedback mechanisms to tidal stripping would disrupt this cross - sectional dependence .",
    "the second solution is that the same feedback mechanisms in lower - mass systems could easily double the typical velocity widths and are therefore central to understanding the overall kinematics of dlas .",
    "these concerns were the focus of the recent simulations by @xcite . arguing that the relation between the absorption cross - section and the dm halo mass might not follow the same trend below @xmath24",
    ", they performed a series of simulations covering a wide spectrum of box sizes and mass resolutions , employing a new conservative entropy formulation of sph and a two - phase sub - resolution model for the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and varying the amount of feedback from star formation ( sf ) with a new phenomenological model for galactic winds .",
    "their highest resolution run features @xmath25 dark matter particles ( and the same number of gas particles ) in a @xmath26 box giving @xmath27 mass resolution . whereas their largest simulation volume is 100 mpc on a side with @xmath28 dark matter particles and @xmath29 times lower mass resolution . with high resolution",
    "runs in small boxes , they see dlas in halos with masses down to @xmath30 .",
    "below this mass at @xmath31 to @xmath1 they notice a sharp drop - off in the dla cross - section which they associate with photoevaporation of gas in these halos by the ionizing uvb and/or to supernovae feedback .",
    "they use the same approach as @xcite to find the cumulative abundance of dlas at each redshift .",
    "they fit a functional form to the relation between the dla cross - section and the total halo mass observed in their simulations , and then convolve it with the @xcite parameterization of the dark matter halo mass function to obtain the total number of dlas per unit redshift as a function of halo mass .",
    "they find a steeper slope for the dla cross - section dependence on halo mass than @xcite resulting in fewer dlas from low - mass halos , and they report a good agreement between the simulated and observed number of dlas at @xmath32 .",
    "however , none of the simulations mentioned above addressed both the kinematics and the gas cross - section properties of dlas in the same numerical output .",
    "we will consider these issues in our current paper .",
    "we also compute self - shielding of protogalaxies from the uvb with a new radiative transfer algorithm .    before we proceed to describe our models , it is useful to review how the numerical simulations mentioned above accounted for shielding from the uvb beyond the hydrogen lyman edge .",
    "@xcite have adopted a simple scheme to mimic the effect of self - shielding based on correlation between the column density and the physical density predicted by earlier numerical simulations in the optically thin regime .",
    "arguing that self - shielding becomes important above an column density of @xmath33 , which corresponds to the absorption - weighted density @xmath34 along the line of sight , they assume that all gas above a density threshold of @xmath35 is self - shielded and fully neutral , and lower density gas is ionized .",
    "@xcite developed a more complex self - shielding correction . during actual simulation",
    "they compute the species abundances from ionization equilibrium in the gas that is optically thin at the lyman limit everywhere in the volume .",
    "then , at the post - processing stage they correct projected maps pixel by pixel recomputing ionizational equilibrium with proper attenuation of the uvb in a plane - parallel slab with the same total hydrogen column density and the same physical size , and therefore accounting for shielding in optically thick systems . according to @xcite , at column densities",
    "@xmath36 the correction is small and varies between @xmath37 and @xmath6 , whereas at higher column densities , @xmath38 , this correction can be as large as a factor of 100 .",
    "@xcite all use this self - shielding correction analyzing models initially computed with ionizational equilibrium in an optically thin gas .    on the other hand , @xcite do not apply any self - shielding correction at all arguing that dlas with column densities above @xmath39 are fully neutral even without the correction  an assumption that , in our view , may not hold in all situations , e.g. , for dense shocks in tidal tails which can nevertheless be subjected to the photoionizing background .",
    "instead , they use a more complicated two - phase ism model , in which they compute the neutral hydrogen fraction with the standard optically thin approximation and a uniform uvb if the local density is below a density threshold @xmath40 which marks the onset of cold cloud formation . above",
    "@xmath40 they use a two - phase model in which the fraction is a function of the local cooling and sf rates and a few parameters including feedback from supernovae .    in this paper",
    "we present new high resolution simulations of damped ly@xmath0 systems at @xmath1 . to resolve individual galaxies",
    ", we use a customized version of the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) eulerian hydrodynamics cosmology code _ enzo _ @xcite which includes simultaneous radiative transfer of the uvb beyond the hydrogen lyman edge on all levels of grid refinement .",
    "our goal is to see whether very high spatial resolution models with sophisticated physics can reproduce the observed kinematic and statistical properties of the low ionization dla metal lines .",
    "we do not include sf feedback in the present study , instead focusing on the physical complications associated with radiative transfer in galaxy formation models with limited numerical resolution .",
    "we are planning to include feedback into our future models .    unlike earlier dla simulations @xcite which considered only absorption by neutral gas in isolated ( and mostly virialized ) galaxies , we do not rule out the hypothesis that at high redshifts @xmath32 a significant fraction of dla absorption is caused by outside the virial radii of the galaxies . there is evidence of active galaxy assembly at those redshifts , and while dlas are most likely associated with the neutral gas from which galaxies form , there is a certain possibility that dla absorption is caused by in tidal tails in mergers @xcite , or even in filaments along which the gas is still falling into dark matter potential wells .",
    "@xcite addressed the possibility that dlas are not necessarily caused by virialized systems , but they assumed a one - to - one correspondence between the local baryon density and the ionizational state of hydrogen which automatically placed all neutral gas into small self - shielded protogalactic clumps .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite identified all dm halos in their simulations and used a relation between the dla cross - section and the total mass of associated halos to compute the number of dlas per unit redshift .    since our models include full angular - dependent radiative transfer , we expect the association between the distribution of neutral hydrogen and dark matter halos to emerge as we move to lower redshifts and higher levels of grid refinement , and consequently as more intergalactic hi either settles down in halos or gets destroyed by the uvb , but we do not put this association into our models in any way .",
    "in fact , the existence of high - velocity clouds in the halo of our own milky way galaxy at present day ( e.g. blitz et al . 1999 and references therein ) implies that we can expect to see extended neutral gas configurations at high redshifts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ simulations ]",
    "we describe our numerical simulations , along with the two - stage radiative transfer algorithm , the choice of the uvb , and our spectrum generation routine .",
    "sections  [ results ] and  [ summary ] present our results and conclusions .",
    "all simulations were run for the flat @xmath41cdm cosmology with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , for a primordial power spectrum @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "all models are summarized in table 1 which lists the simulation volume size , the base grid size , the maximum number of levels of refinement , the total number of grids at the end of each run at @xmath1 , grid resolution , and mass resolution of each model which is simply the mass of a dm particle .",
    "most of the models include full radiative transfer , except for runs c2s and c2 t which were computed with self - shielding above density @xmath35 and in the optically thin regime , respectively .    ccccccc model & @xmath48 , @xmath49 & base grid & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 , @xmath53 & @xmath54 , @xmath55 + & comoving & & & at @xmath1 & comoving & +   + a1 & 2 & @xmath56 & 6 & 13,160 & 0.25 & @xmath57 +   + b1 & 4 & @xmath56 & 6 & 14,150 & 0.5 & @xmath58 +   + c-1 & 8 & @xmath56 & 4 & 13,228 & 4 & @xmath59 + c0 & 8 & @xmath56 & 5 & 14,151 & 2 & @xmath59 + c1 & 8 & @xmath56 & 6 & 14,865 & 1 & @xmath59 + c2 & 8 & @xmath56 & 7 & 15,735 & 0.5 & @xmath59 +    we identify the following three parameters in our calculations : grid resolution , box size / mass resolution , and the uvb amplitude .",
    "we consider the box sizes of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 mpc , with base grid resolution @xmath56 and up to seven levels of refinement by a factor of two . in _ _ e__nzo the total number of dm particles is always the same as the number of base grid cells @xmath63 resulting in mass resolution    @xmath64    therefore , for a fixed base grid , mass resolution is determined by the current box size .",
    "we use a two - step algorithm for radiative transfer .",
    "first , we evolve all simulation volumes solving the radiative transfer equation in a low angular resolution mode simultaneously with the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "to correct for low resolution , we apply a high angular resolution transfer filter iteratively to our solutions at @xmath1 to improve on the equilibrium position of hi , hei and heii ionization fronts .",
    "we developed a uvb radiative transfer module for the parallel amr cosmology n - body eulerian hydrodynamics code _ enzo_. the fluid flow equations are solved with the ppm scheme @xcite on a comoving grid ( see for @xcite for details ) , and chemical abundances for various ionization and molecular states of hydrogen and helium are solved with a chemical reaction network with 9 species and 28 reactions @xcite .",
    "each level of grid refinement has twice the spatial resolution of the previous level .",
    "we solve the radiative transfer equation with a photon conserving scheme self - consistently at each level of resolution carrying fluxes explicitly from parent grids to all of its subgrids . on each grid ,",
    "radiative transfer is computed with a timestep which is usually significantly smaller than the hydro timestep and is adjusted adaptively to obtain the best balance between accuracy and the speed of calculations . due to complexity of the setup we have not included point source radiation in our models yet , and also we limit transport of background radiation to simple sweeps along the xyz - coordinate axis .",
    "we then post - process _",
    "output with much higher angular resolution transfer .",
    "below we describe these two steps in detail .      by definition , radiation propagates at the speed of light . in an explicit advection numerical scheme",
    "the courant condition would necessarily require prohibitively small timesteps to guarantee stability .",
    "however , our photon conservation technique is inherently stable , and from this standpoint there is no need to take very small timesteps , but accuracy of the solution is an entirely different issue . in many cases where the supply of ionizing photons greatly exceeds the recombination rate i - fronts",
    "can propagate at or close to the speed of light , and even in this regime our photon conservation will give an accurate solution as long as the radiation - chemistry timestep is small enough .",
    "how do we ensure that we provide timesteps small enough to balance accuracy and speed of calculations ?    let us first describe our numerical setup .",
    "since in general radiation driven fronts can propagate much faster than the fluid flow , radiative transfer and chemistry normally have to be iterated multiple times per hydro time step .",
    "on each subgrid , independently of the resolution level , first we perform a hydrodynamical update at a fixed timestep @xmath65 determined from the hydrodynamical courant condition on that subgrid .",
    "we then proceed to compute photon conservation in all directions on a much smaller timestep @xmath66 where @xmath67 is some positive integer number .",
    "we then update temperature and solve the chemical rate equations on the same small @xmath68 .",
    "next we compare distributions of some state variable , e.g. , a fraction @xmath69 of ionized hydrogen on our subgrid . if the maximum change in @xmath69 during @xmath68 on the subgrid does not exceed @xmath6 then we increase @xmath68 by a factor of two , otherwise keep the same small @xmath68 , and do another radiation - chemistry update , and repeat the whole procedure of these updates until we reach the end of the hydro step @xmath65 .",
    "ideally , if there are no i - fronts on the subgrid we can do the entire radiation - chemistry calculation with @xmath67 subcycles for each hydro step . on the other hand , in the worst case scenario with fast i - fronts we will need @xmath70 subcycles .",
    "the exact number of subcycles between @xmath67 and @xmath70 is determined automatically by the code based on maximum relative changes in @xmath69 in our subvolume .    to determine a suitable value of @xmath67 , we ran a number of tests with @xmath66 fixed throughout the entire run from high to moderate redshifts .",
    "we observe fast convergence as the number of subcycles reaches few tens , but the solution is accurate enough even for @xmath71 . in all our calculations we use",
    "@xmath72 varying the number of subcycles between @xmath67 and @xmath70 as described above .",
    "ionizing photons in our model all originate at the edge of the base grid , and propagate inward .",
    "parallelization in _ enzo _ is done through volume decomposition in which the lowest resolution base grid is subdivided equally between all processors .",
    "since we treat radiation explicitly , solutions to the radiation field in all directions on all processors have to be connected to each other at every radiation - chemistry subcycle , and at the same time we need to minimize the amount of idle time each processor spends waiting for flux updates from neighboring volumes . to achieve this goal of optimal parallelization and best load balancing while simultaneously transporting photons in all directions , we constructed the following algorithm . at the beginning of every radiation - chemistry subcycle each processor scans all angular directions in some preset order checking if input fluxes ( from the boundary or from another processor ) are available in that direction and if radiative update has not been done yet . when it finds such an angle , it performs radiative transfer in that direction , while all other processors are doing their own updates .",
    "if no input flux in any direction is available then the processor sits idle for the duration of this directional subcycle .",
    "when the subcycle is done , fluxes are passed to neighboring volumes , and a new subcycle begins . to further illustrate this idea",
    ", we drew a sequence of directional updates for the @xmath73 volume decomposition in fig .",
    "[ fig : directions ] . in this particular example",
    "we have a @xmath74 parallelization efficiency , which is clearly not always achievable for larger decompositions .    to summarize , in the hierarchy of events on a base grid every single hydrodynamical step is followed by a series of radiation - chemistry updates each of which in turn contains directional subcycling with flux exchanges among individual processors .",
    "when a spatial region is refined , radiation fluxes for both stellar and quasar components in all six directions are passed from parent grids to subgrids , along with all hydrodynamical variables .",
    "our radiation hydrodynamics ( rhd ) calculation is parallelized via domain decomposition , in which we pass radiative intensities from one processor to another on the base grid , and in turn on each processor we advect these intensities along the amr grid hierarchy .",
    "this approach results in a fairly complex algorithm , forcing us to limit rhd transport only to the six directions along the major axes .",
    "the total number of photons entering the volume in plane - parallel fluxes is kept the same as if we had an isotropic incident distribution , therefore those photons which burn their way into a denser environment at small solid angles tend to over - heat and over - ionize the medium . at the same time this approximation naturally leads to formation of shadows behind self - shielded regions which in reality could be exposed to ionizing radiation . to compensate for this shortcoming , we post - process our 3d ionization and temperature distributions with a much higher angular resolution radiative transfer code based on a new fully threaded transport engine algorithm ( ftte ) by @xcite .    at each output redshift",
    "we convert the block - structured amr output of our coupled rhd runs to a fully threaded format and use it as a first guess to compute radiative transfer with ftte along 192 directions chosen to subdivide the entire sphere into equal solid angle elements .",
    "we then use this updated radiation field to compute the ionizational structure and temperature , and then iterate in radiative transfer and chemistry until we find the equilibrium positions of hi , hei and heii ionization fronts at a given redshift .",
    "we find that @xmath75 iterations are needed for convergence .",
    "constraints on the uvb at high redshifts come from the ly@xmath0 forest studies .",
    "@xcite used the proximity effect in quasar absorption spectra to derive the uvb amplitude assuming that it has the same spectrum as individual quasars . using ly - alpha emission line redshifts , they get the value @xmath76 for @xmath77 . on the other hand , with oiii and mgii redshifts",
    "they get a lower value @xmath78 for @xmath77 , corresponding to hi photoionization rate @xmath79 .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite build a concordance model of the ly@xmath0 forest at @xmath80 using a series of hydrodynamical simulations with grid sizes up to @xmath81 and box sizes up to 76.8 mpc to reproduce the observed flux decrement from the low - density intergalactic medium ( igm ) alone .",
    "their uvb corresponds to an ionization rate per atom of @xmath82 , which is slightly higher than the earlier estimates , e.g. , the prediction by @xcite with 61% from qsos and 39% from stars .",
    "the redshift evolution of this concordance model can be found in @xcite .",
    "a more recent study by @xcite extends this higher estimate of @xmath83 to the redshift range @xmath84 translating into @xmath85 .",
    "the background in the vicinity of dlas in a cluster that does not host a quasar is most likely going to be smaller than these average values , due to the geometrical dilution factor , and local attenuation in the cluster . in our other models",
    "not listed in table 1 we experimented with a variety of uvb spectra and amplitudes , and as a reference we decided to use a smaller background based on @xcite .",
    "we included both stellar and quasar ionizing photons adopting a two - component power - law uvb    @xmath86    where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the model parameters .",

    "as the main focus of this paper is to study the resolution effects of radiative transfer in galaxy formation models , we do not explore other possible star formation histories , but undoubtedly the cumulative history of star formation at @xmath97 might have an important effect on the observable properties of galaxies even at lower redshifts .",

    "spectra 2 and 8 ( counting from the top ) are particularly clear examples of several components falling onto the same line of sight .",
    "these multiple component dlas give rise to distinct tails at higher velocities which stand out in our high ( 190 pc physical ) resolution models c2 ( upper panel ) and b1 ( lower panel ) .",
    "while the highest resolution run a1 ( lower panel ) shows a similar tail , it is shifted towards lower ( @xmath130 ) velocity widths , in part due to the smaller velocity dispersion in the cluster , and in part due to the lower cross - sections of individual absorbers .",
    "to summarize , none of our models at this stage are able to reproduce the observed velocity width distribution for systems with @xmath131 .",
    "although the resolution effects are complex , and none of our models have fully converged to the observed column density distribution yet , it seems plausible that some of the effects described in this section can drive the line profile distribution to even lower velocities .",

    "since we include the effects of the uvb on gas at the surface of dlas , it is interesting to make an independent estimate of neutral hydrogen cross - sections for individual absorbers in our models .",

    "however , it is only above the mass @xmath8 that we start seeing a significant population of halos with hi in absorption .",
    "the fact that we see neutral gas in halos with masses slightly below the cut - off of @xcite can be attributed to both the spatial variations in the uvb inside the galaxy cluster and the lack of supernova feedback in our models .",
    "as @xcite pointed out , a sharp cut - off should be expected due to the strong dependence of baryon cooling and photoheating on the virial temperatures of halos around @xmath157 .",
    "in fact , we see such a cutoff at @xmath158 in fig .  [",
    "fig : masscrosssection.runa1.runb1.runc2.z3q10s10 ] . as all photoionizing radiation in our models comes from the box boundary ,",

    "furthermore , a number of galaxies in the mass range @xmath160 are not exposed to the full uvb as part of their `` sky '' is blocked by nearby absorption systems ( see , e.g. , the zoom - in panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : runc1.z3q10s10.columndensitymap.mosaic ] ) , and the mass cut - off above which galaxies can retain neutral gas is shifted towards slightly lower masses . of course , this effect depends on the environment and will be more pronounced at higher redshifts where the spatial variations in the uvb are larger . star formation and supernova feedback",
    "will partially reverse this effect removing neutral material from lower mass galaxies assuming that these galaxies have accumulated enough cold gas to host star formation in the first place .",
    "however , this effect is very complex and , in addition to the mechanical feedback from winds and supernovae , will have to include transfer of locally generated uv photons .",
    "our distributions are somewhat sensitive to a change in the uvb .",

    "as we increase the uvb amplitude and simultaneously steepen its spectrum , more hi is ionized everywhere on the outskirts of galaxies , but in terms of dla statistics  not surprisingly  primarily low column density systems are affected . while the under - resolved model c1 features the cumulative number of dlas @xmath161 above the observed value at @xmath1 , the higher uvb model c1c has the number of dlas @xmath161 below the observed value .",
    "noticeable differences between the two models extend to the column density @xmath162 , but the higher column density systems are not affected .",
    "in addition to the full radiative transfer run c2 in the @xmath123 volume , we also computed a model c2s with complete self - shielding above the physical density @xmath35 , assuming that the local uvb is just the uniform cosmic background from fig .",
    "[ fig : uvb02 ] in every cell below this threshold , and zero above it .",
    "this assumption has been previously used in dla modeling , e.g. , in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : frequencydistribution.abundancevelocity.runc2.z3q10s10.shield.thin ] we plotted distributions for these three models .",
    "all three models were iterated until h / he ionization equilibrium .",
    "it is evident that self - shielding of neutral gas is the dominant mechanism determining all properties of dlas .",
    "the model with the uniform background in the optically thin regime produces very few dlas as expected .",
    "surprisingly , the full transfer model and the one with self - shielding give roughly the same cumulative number of dlas .",
    "however , since the transfer model includes high energy photons , the ionizational structure of hi regions is more complex than in the fully shielded case .",
    "these differences result in vastly different line widths distributions : in the self - shielded model most lines widths are clustered around @xmath163 , whereas in the model with transfer they are concentrated at higher velocities in the range @xmath164 . it is reassuring that the model with full transfer in the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequencydistribution.abundancevelocity.runc2.z3q10s10.shield.thin ] is about half - way from the self - shielded model to observational data .",
    "it is important to point out that our self - shielded model produces results very different from @xcite , namely substantially smaller velocity widths on average .",
    "a number of factors could contribute to this difference , such as the use of eulerian hydrodynamics with amr instead of sph , but perhaps the most important factors are our much larger sample of galaxies ( we used 710 distinct halos to generate 406 dlas in runc2s vs. their sample of 40 protogalactic clumps used repeatedly to produce 640 dlas ) , and our much higher grid resolution ( 190 pc physical vs. their 1 kpc ) .",
    "but as we point out , our full radiative transfer runs produce further improvement in kinematics modeling rendering any self - shielded models obsolete .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : jmean.runc2.z3q10s10 ] we plotted the mean specific intensity at @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath100 vs. the local gas number density at @xmath1 .",
    "one can easily see hardening of the spectrum in self - shielded regions above the physical density @xmath35 , as more energetic photons travel further in the neutral medium .",
    "the standard hierarchical model is very successful in explaining the emergence of structures in the early universe .",
    "dlas are viewed as neutral gas clouds confined to individual galaxies , whether in virialized systems or systems still in the process of merging .",
    "this paradigm is clearly seen in most previous dla simulation literature where analysis is based on a fit to the relation between dla cross - section and halo mass .",
    "the results of high resolution simulations by @xcite suggest that small protogalactic clumps in the process of merger could explain the observed line profiles , and the statistical analysis of absorption line kinematics within semi - analytical models by @xcite suggests that tidal tails can be responsible for absorption .    to test both these hypotheses and a broader idea that dlas can be caused by absorption in neutral intergalactic clouds either stripped of galaxies during interactions or even still accreting onto galaxies from the igm",
    ", we propose to include radiative transfer of the uvb into galaxy formation models , and argue that this new piece of physics is essential in order to reproduce dla observables such as the column density and velocity width distributions .",
    "an accurate treatment of background photons allows us to address the ionization structure of the outskirts of high redshift galaxies in a much more precise way .",
    "we simulate galaxy formation in a series of cosmological volumes ranging in size from 2 mpc to 8 mpc , solving simultaneously for the first time coupled equations of hydrodynamics , self - gravity , multi - species chemistry and radiative transfer to account for shielding against the uvb .",
    "radiative transfer is computed on all levels of grid refinement with a two - stage calculation , first just along the three major axes simultaneously with hydrodynamics , and then in 192 directions in the postprocessing mode .",
    "we use amr to resolve individual galaxies with the same refinement criteria everywhere in the volume . similar to @xcite",
    ", we use a series of computational volumes of different sizes while varying numerical resolution to try to achieve optimal balance between resolution and fair volume sampling .",
    "however , because we do not restrict damped ly@xmath0 absorption to halos , we do not assume any single relation between dla cross section and halo mass for analysis .",
    "there is a relation between dla cross - section and associated line width which in _ some _ cases is indeed caused by the velocity dispersion within individual galaxies .",
    "our findings are as follows .    * * resolution : * as we increase grid resolution , our column densities demonstrate a trend in convergence towards the observed distributions . however , we can not reproduce the high - end tail of the velocity width distribution . although it is possible that the resolution effects and limitation in box sizes are responsible for this shortcoming , feedback from star formation which we have not included into the current models is likely to produce expanding shells and therefore higher velocity widths on average .",
    "the column density distributions alone indicate that the minimum required grid resolution has to be better than @xmath167 in comoving coordinates , or @xmath168 in physical space .",
    "the minimum mass resolution is @xmath169 corresponding to at least a hundred dm particles per halo which is still capable of being self - shielded from the uvb . *",
    "* filamentary dlas : * the nature of dla absorption is a function of halo environment , at any given redshift .",
    "although all self - shielded halos can give rise to dlas , not all dlas can be associated with individual halos .",
    "we find that in massive cluster environments at @xmath1 tidal tails and quasi - filamentary structures often appear to be self - shielded against the uvb .",
    "the typical column densities of filamentary dlas are below @xmath4 , and physical widths are of order @xmath149 .",
    "since we have not achieved numerical convergence , we have not attempted a comprehensive , redshift - dependent statistical study to distinguish halo dlas from the ones caused by tidal tails , and both of these from dlas caused by primordial gas still accreting onto galaxies .",
    "+ provided that filamentary structures are still self - shielded at higher grid resolution , it seems plausible that going to higher resolution would only increase the filamentary contribution to dla absorption , as the 3d density peaks ( halos ) would contribute progressively less to the total hi column density than the 2d density peaks ( filaments ) as baryons cool and collapse on finer grids . *",
    "* photoionization of low - mass galaxies : * the least massive single galaxy associated with dlas in our models has the mass @xmath170 .",
    "however , we see a significant population of halos with hi in absorption only above the mass @xmath8 below which just a few dwarf galaxies retained any sufficient amount of neutral gas by @xmath1 .",
    "this threshold is slightly lower than the previously reported values of @xmath134 to few @xmath134 @xcite contributing to larger dla counts in less massive halo environments .",
    "part of this discrepancy can be explained by spatial variations in the uvb inside the galaxy cluster , and it is possible that supernova feedback which is not included into our models could also have a role removing neutral gas from low - mass galaxies . * * self - shielding model : * calculations with self - shielding above density @xmath35 produce roughly the same total number of dlas per unit absorption distance as the run with full radiative transfer .",
    "however , the absorption line width distributions in the two models are markedly different due to variations in ionizational profiles .",

    "for example , winds from sf regions and/or sne could create denser shells around low - density bubbles . if dense enough , these shells might contribute to an overall increase in dla effective cross - sections @xcite .",
    "of course , there is a competing effect if feedback destroys neutral gas in halos as observed in @xcite .",

    "the average separation between quasars at @xmath172 is more than an order of magnitude greater than our current largest simulation volume .",
    "similar to the proximity effect observed in quasar spectra , very few halos would produce a dla in a cluster that hosts a quasar . as we move further away from a quasar , the mean background drops .",
    "it is also attenuated in large clusters of galaxies due to the overall higher igm column densities .",
    "if the typical uvb in the vicinity of dlas is 50 - 75% lower than the cosmic average , it could yield dramatically different dla counts .",
