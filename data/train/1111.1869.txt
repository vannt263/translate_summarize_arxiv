    "furthermore , in ref.@xcite the authors have proposed a different scheme to enhance the cooling process by using the photothermal ( bolometric ) force@xcite .",
    "they have taken into account the noise effects due to the granular nature of photon absorption and finally have shown that the mechanical resonator can achieve the lowest phonon occupation number by means of this procedure .",
    "moreover , it seems promising for the realization of long - range interaction between qubits in future quantum information hardwares @xcite , and for probing quantum mechanics at increasingly large mass and length scales@xcite .",
    "the coupling of a mr via radiation pressure to a cavity field shows interesting similarities to an intracavity nonlinear kerr - like interaction@xcite or even a more complicated form of nonlinearity@xcite .    to observe and control quantum behavior in an optomechanical system ,",
    "it is essential to increase the strength of the coupling between the mechanical and optical degree of freedom .",
    "however , the form of this coupling(e.g . , linear or nonlinear ) is crucial in determining which phenomena can be observed in such a system .",
    "thanks to rapid progress of nano - technology , it has been possible to manipulate the optomechanical coupling in quantum optomechanical hybrid systems . in this direction",
    "most experimental and theoretical efforts are devoted to entangling a mr either with a single atom @xcite or with atomic ensembles @xcite , entangling a nanomechanical oscillator with a cooper - pair box @xcite , and entangling two charge qubits @xcite or two josephson junctions @xcite via nanomechanical resonators .",
    "alternatively , schemes for entangling a superconducting coplanar waveguide field with a nanomechanical resonator , either via a cooper - pair box within the waveguide @xcite , or via direct capacitive coupling @xcite , have been proposed .    in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors have proposed a scheme for the realization of a hybrid , strongly quantum - correlated system consisting of an atomic ensemble surrounded by a high - finesse optical cavity with a vibrating mirror .",
    "they have shown that , in an experimentally accessible parameter regime , the steady state of the system shows both tripartite and bipartite continuous variable(cv ) entanglement .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of a movable mirror of a cavity coupled through radiation pressure to the light scattered from ultracold atoms in an optical lattice has been investigated ref.@xcite .",
    "the author has shown that in the presence of atom - atom interaction as a source of nonlinearity@xcite , the coupling of the mechanical oscillator , the cavity field fluctuations and the condensate fluctuations ( bogoliubov mode ) leads to the splitting of the normal mode into three modes ( normal - mode splitting(nms)@xcite ) .",

    "the infinite set of optical modes of the cavity can be described by hermit - gauss modes .",
    "as we will see , the intracavity mode structure can be employed to realize a type of intensity - dependent coupling of the single atom to the vibrational mode of mr .",
    "the presence of such intensity - dependent interaction modifies the dynamics of the system , the entanglement properties and the displacement spectrum of mr .",
    "we show that in the first vibrational sideband of mr , the stationary , i.e. , long - lived , atom - mirror entanglement can be generated by proper matching the lamb - dicke parameter(ldp ) .",
    "this parameter plays an important role in our investigation in the sense that it determines the strength of the nonlinearity in the system .",
    "we show that the bipartite entanglement between the subsystems extremely depends on the ldp .",
    "it is also remarkable that , in the steady - state condition , the high resolution of nms in the form of three - mode splitting is approached . in particular",

    "ref.@xcite has proposed a scheme to measure mechanical position and momentum of the mr , in which by adjusting the detuning and bandwidth of an additional adjacent cavity , both position and momentum of the mirror can be measured by homodyning the output of the second cavity . moreover , by adopting the same scheme of ref.@xcite , the atomic polarization quadratures @xmath178 and @xmath179 can be measured , i.e. , by making a stokes parameter measurement of a laser beam , shined transversal to the cavity and to the cell and off - resonantly tuned to another atomic transition .",
    "very recently , ref.@xcite has demonstrated the proof of principle of the use of a bose - einstein condensate(bec ) as a diagnostic tool to determine the elusive mirror - light entanglement in a hybrid optomechanical device .",
    "in such a case , one dose find a working point such that the mirror - light entanglement is reproduced by the bec- light quantum correlations .",
    "in this section , we show that the atom - field - mirror coupling leads to the splitting of the normal mode into three modes [ normal mode splitting(nms ) ] .",
    "the optomechanical nms however involves driving four parametrically coupled nondegenerate modes out of equilibrium .",

    "this figure shows the displacement spectrum of the mr versus the normalized frequency @xmath182 and atomic detuning @xmath188 at @xmath185 .",
    "the three - mode splitting manifests itself mainly at @xmath189 . by going through the region far from @xmath189 , three - mode splitting merges into two - mode splitting around @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the nms is associated with the mixing among the vibrational mode of the mr , the fluctuations of the cavity field around the steady state and the fluctuations of the atomic mode .",
    "the origin of the fluctuations of the cavity field is the beat of the pump photons with the photons scattered from the atom . for",
    "not so large values of the ldp(small nonlinearity ) the field - atom coupling is much smaller than the field - mirror coupling .",
    "therefore , the system simply reduces to the case of two mode coupling , i.e. , coupling between the mechanical mode and the photon fluctuations@xcite . when the ldp is large enough the mechanical mode , the photon mode , and the atomic mode forms a system of three coupled oscillators .",
    "the occurrence of splitting of the normal mode into three modes has been analyzed recently in another tripartite system , i.e. , a cavity quantum optomechanical system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice@xcite .",
    "furthermore , similar three coupled oscillator experimental results where two coupled cavities , each containing three identical quantum wells@xcite and one microcavity containing two quantum wells@xcite have been reported .     versus @xmath182 and @xmath188 for @xmath156k and @xmath157 .",

    "3.,width=326 ]    it should be pointed out that to observe the nms , the energy exchange between the three modes should take place on a time scale faster than the decoherence of each mode .",
    "the normal mode splitting into three modes due to local increasing of the ldp has also been reported in ref.@xcite , where the authors have shown that the nms can be observed only if the coupling between the atoms and the cavity is strong enough .",
    "this strong coupling can be achieved by increasing the atom numbers .",
    "one experimental limitation could be spontaneous emission which leads to momentum diffusion and hence heating of the atomic sample@xcite . in our model",
    ", we do nt encounter such a limitation and three - mode splitting is approached by proper choosing of the ldp .",
    "in this work , we have proposed a theoretical scheme for the realization of tripartite intensity - dependent coupling among a single mode of a fabry - perot cavity with an oscillating mirror , a single two - level atom inside it , and a vibrational mode of the oscillating mirror .",
    "we have shown that in the presence of gaussian standing - wave of the optical cavity mode , a type of tripartite between atom - mirror - field coupling can be manifested . to describe such interaction we then have found the general form of the corresponding nonlinear hamiltonian .",
    "we have restricted our investigation to first vibrational sideband @xmath84 and have studied its dynamics by adopting a qle treatment .",
    "we have focused our attention on the steady state of the system and in particular , on the stationary quantum fluctuations of the system by solving the linearized dynamics around the classical steady state .",
    "we have seen that , in an experimentally accessible parameter regime , the steady state of the system shows both the tripartite and the bipartite cv entanglement .",
    "we have shown that the ldp(as a measure of the strength of nonlinearity)can extremely modifies both the tripartite and the bipartite cv entanglement in the system .",
    "in particular , by increasing the ldp , one can see that the field - atom and atom - mirror entanglement increase at the expense of optical - mechanical entanglement .",
    "the intracavity mode is able to mediate for the realization of a robust stationary ( i.e. , persistent ) entanglement between the mr mode and the single two - level atom , which could be extremely useful in quantum information / quantum computer networks in which the mr modes are used for quantum communications@xcite , and the atom is used as a qubit(e.g .",
    ", solid - state qubits ) .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the occurrence of the nms in the displacement spectrum of the oscillating mirror . as we have shown , for a small value of the ldp , the usual normal - mode splitting into two modes with central peaks at the sidebands @xmath186 is observed and by increasing the ldp the normal mode splits up into three modes .",
    "we have shown that , when the ldp is large enough the mechanical mode , the photon mode , and the atomic mode forms a system of three coupled oscillators .",
    "the realization of such a scheme will also open new opportunities for the implementation of quantum teleportation and/or the photon blockade process to prevent two or more photons from entering the cavity at the same time .",
