    "the transition between a class i and a class ii source ( lada & wilking 1984 ) is one of the less well - known phases in the life of a young stellar object ( yso ) .",
    "this period is also one of the most interesting in the evolution of a young star as outflow phenomena , which may determine the final mass of the star and process the material in the surrounding molecular cloud , are particularly active at this stage .",
    "however , only few objects are known at or near this boundary between protostar and pre - main sequence star , limiting our possibilities to gain more insight in the physical mechanisms behind this rapid transition .",
    "recently a nebulous object , holoea ( iras 05327 + 3404 ; hawaiian for flowing gas ) , was discovered which shows some characteristics of a class i source ( flat spectrum , outflow ) , but also has some class ii characteristics ( optically visible central star ) .",
    "this object has increased its optical brightness over the last 50 years , suggesting that it is in the process of becoming exposed and making the transition between a protostar and a pre - main sequence star ( magnier et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "guided by the observed properties of holoea , we have therefore performed a systematic search for additional candidates for the group of transitional ysos , the results of which are presented in these proceedings .",

    "our initial selection criterion for transitional yso candidates is based on their infrared spectrum .",
    "we selected all point sources with infrared colors similar to holoea ( @xmath3-[25 ] = + 2.5 \\log ( f_{12}/f_{25 } ) < -0.40 $ ] , @xmath4-[60 ] = + 2.5 \\log ( f_{25}/f_{60 } ) < -1.0 $ ] ) and reliable data in the 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath5 m bands ( category 3 detections ) from the iras point source catalog . this resulted in a list of 327 iras sources . to narrow down this list , we examined small ( 4@xmath6 4 ) fields extracted from the digital sky survey ( dss ) in centered on each source to check for traces of nebulosity , as is also seen near holoea . since the nuclei of seyfert galaxies may have iras colors similar to our selected range , a number of sources which were clearly associated with spiral galaxies were also rejected .",
    "this resulted in 125 candidate sources .",
    "the vast majority of these were found to be located in the vicinity of co clouds and generally near other signs of active star formation .",
    "this lends credence to our suggestion that the bulk of these sources are young stellar objects .",
    "for the southern sources in our list of 125 transitional yso candidates , ccd imaging in the bessel @xmath7 , bessel @xmath8 and gunn @xmath9 bands was carried out on the dutch 90 cm telescope at eso , la silla . for the sources accessible from the north , ccd images of each source in @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( krisciunas et al .",
    "1998 ) and near - infrared @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 filters were taken at the university of washington apache point observatory 3.5 m telescope , new mexico .",
    "data were reduced in a standard fashion , after which they were positionally and flux - calibrated and aperture photometry was performed for the dominant optical source in the iras error ellipse .",
    "in addition to this , we generated high - resolution iras 60 @xmath5 m maximum entropy processed images ( hiras ; bontekoe et al .",
    "1994 ) of the environment of each candidate .",
    "we have classified the objects in seven categories based on their morphology in the ccd images and the spectral index of the dominant optical source in the iras error ellipse :    1 .   a likely transitional yso : a single moderately - bright , very red stellar object with extensive associated reflection nebulosity .",
    "( 28  objects ) 2 .   a possible transitional yso : a moderately red stellar object with weak nebulosity or a significantly red object with no nebulosity .",
    "( 22  objects ) 3 .   a yso group : several very red objects , usually with extended nebulosity .",
    "no single object stands out .",
    "( 21  objects ) 4 .",
    "bright ( herbig ae / be like ) star .",
    "( 7  objects ) 5 .   a cluster of stars : usually a red cluster with no single very red star . ( 18  objects ) 6 .   a galaxy",
    "( 11  objects ) 7 .",
    "nothing : no object stands out , and no object can be associated with any of the other classes . ( 18  objects )    the sources with category 1 and 2 classifications ( likely transitional ysos ) and category 4 classifications ( herbig ae / be star candidates ) are listed in table  1 .    in figures 2 and 3",
    "we show infrared and optical color - color diagrams of the sources in our sample with category 1 and 2 identifications . for comparison we also show the location of t tauri stars in taurus - aurigae , taken from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) in these diagrams . on average our category 1 and 2 sources have redder iras colors than t tauri stars .",
    "they have an infrared energy distribution that is wider than a blackbody , with a typical peak temperature of 200300  k. the slope of their energy distribution appears compatible with infall rather than a steady - state disk .",
    "the optical colors of the category 1 and 2 sources in our sample are on average also redder than those of t tauri stars .",
    "because the slope of the reddening direction in the @xmath16 versus @xmath17 diagram is nearly parallel to that of decreasing effective temperature , we can not determine with the current data whether this is caused by a difference in stellar temperature or due to additional extinction in our sources .",
    "however , the mere fact that these sources are on average very red suggests that our identification of the optical source with the iras source is correct and these objects do indeed have an energy distribution that is similar to holoea .",
    "our selection criteria to identify transitional yso candidates have been rather successful .",
    "of the 125 objects , 28 have a variety of characteristics very similar to other transitional ysos , while another 22 show some of these characteristics .",
    "the fact that our category 1 and category 2 yso candidates show on average redder optical and infrared colors than t tauri stars agrees with our hypothesis that these objects are in the process of making the transition between lada class i and ii . if confirmed , this would suggest that these transitional ysos are not as rare as predicted by theory .",
    "in addition to this , we have found seven objects to be good candidates for members of the herbig ae / be stellar group , of which three are newly identified as such .",
    "a follow - up study of our category 1 , 2 and 4 yso candidates using newly obtained optical spectroscopy and submillimeter spectral - line data is under way and will allow us to make a more detailed assessment of the nature of these sources .",
