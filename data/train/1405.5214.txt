    "the _ fermi _ bubbles are huge gamma - ray structure detected by the _ fermi _ gamma - ray satellite @xcite .",
    "the two bubbles are symmetric about the galactic plane and they extend @xmath3 above and below the galactic center ( gc ) . their surface brightness is almost uniform and they have sharp rims . the gamma - ray spectrum is hard ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "similar structures have been found in the radio @xcite and x - ray bands @xcite . while the morphology of the bubbles suggests that they were created through some violent activities around the gc , the origin of the cosmic - rays ( crs ) that are responsible for the non - thermal emission has not been identified .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain properties of the _ fermi _ bubbles . in some models , star formation activities around the gc",
    "are thought to be the origin of the crs @xcite . in other models ,",
    "crs are carried by jets or outflows generated by the super - massive black hole at the gc @xcite or they are accelerated in the bubbles @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the _ fermi _ bubbles may be a result of diffusive injection of galactic cr protons during their propagation through the galaxy , if the bubbles are expanding very slowly @xcite .",
    "the gamma - rays can be generated by interaction between cr protons and ambient gas ( hadronic models ) , or by inverse compton scattering by cr electrons ( leptonic models ) .",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) proposed that cr protons accelerated at the forward shock of the bubbles generate gamma - rays through the hadronic interaction with gas protons ( @xmath5-interaction ) .",
    "we showed that the observed gamma - ray properties of the _ fermi _ bubbles , such as the flat intensity profile , the sharp edge , and the hard spectrum , can be reproduced if the crs were accelerated when the bubbles were small , and if the time scale of the energy injection at the gc was much smaller than the current age of the bubbles .",
    "the crs are confined in the bubbles , because they excite alfvn waves around the bubbles through streaming instabilities and the waves scatter the crs well .    in this paper",
    ", we further develop the hadronic model .",
    "we study re - acceleration of background crs by the _ fermi _ bubbles .",
    "those background crs have escaped from the galactic disk , and they are distributed in the galactic halo . if the density of the background crs is large and/or if they are effectively re - accelerated , the gamma - ray emission from the bubbles would be significantly affected by them .",
    "we also investigate radio emission from cr electrons in the _ fermi _ bubbles , which was not investigated in paper  i. this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe our model for the evolution of the bubble and the acceleration of the crs . in section",
    "[ sec : result ] , we show the results of our calculations and discuss the re - acceleration of the background crs and the radio emission from the bubbles . finally , section  [ sec : conc ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "after energy is injected at the gc , a forward shock propagates in the galactic halo .",
    "we do not consider the details of the energy injection ; it may be caused by the activities of the super - massive black hole at the gc . in paper",
    "i , we approximately treated the shock propagation using self - similar solutions under the assumption that the shock is strong . in this study , we numerically calculate the evolution , which enables us to include the effects of gravity from the galaxy and decreasing mach number of the shock .",
    "we assume that the time - scale of the energy injection is much smaller than the current age of the bubbles ( @xmath6  yr ) , because long - time injection is inconsistent with the gamma - ray intensity profile ( paper  i ) .",
    "we do not consider the feedback from the accelerated crs on gas because the mach number is small ( @xmath1 ; see figure  [ fig : mach ] ) .    for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the bubble is spherically symmetric , and we mainly focus on the high - galactic - latitude part of the _ fermi _ bubbles ( large @xmath7 and small @xmath8 in the galactic coordinate ) .",
    "we solve the following equations : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 = - \\rho u \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial r}\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the gas density , @xmath13 is the velocity , @xmath14 is the pressure , and @xmath15 the galactic potential .",

    "we use a fixed galactic potential adopted by @xcite .",
    "the potential along the rotation axis of the galaxy can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the halo potential , @xmath20 is the potential for the miyamoto - nagai disk @xcite , and @xmath21 is the potential for the hernquist stellar bulge .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 , @xmath23  kpc , @xmath24 , @xmath25  kpc , @xmath26  kpc , @xmath27 , and @xmath28  kpc . at @xmath29 ,",
    "the gas in the potential is isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the temperature is @xmath30  k and the density at @xmath31 is @xmath32 .      in paper",
    "i , we solved a diffusion - convection equation to follow the evolution of cr distribution functions @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the momentum of crs .",
    "the equation was applied in the region far enough away from the shock and the cr acceleration at the shock front was separately treated by adopting a simple model . in this study , we treat not only protons ( @xmath35 ) but also electrons ( @xmath36 ) and positrons ( @xmath37 ) . the equations are @xmath38 p\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial p } + q_i\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath40 is the velocity of the waves that scatter crs .",
    "the source @xmath41 describes particle injection for @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the shock radius .",
    "the third term in the right - hand side represents cooling . for protons",
    ", the cooling can be ignored , and hence @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath45 for protons , because they are injected ( accelerated ) only at the shock front .",
    "we also assume that @xmath46 for @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the alfvn velocity , and that @xmath49 for @xmath50 because the waves would isotropically propagate there .    in paper",
    "i , we considered the evolution of @xmath39 by calculating growth of alfvn waves through streaming instabilities .",
    "the results showed that crs are well scattered by the waves and confined around the bubbles because of decrease of @xmath39 .",
    "while this also happens around supernova remnants @xcite , the inefficiency of the cr diffusion is more significant for the _ fermi _ bubbles because of their huge size for a given diffusion scale .",
    "thus , we assume that the diffusion coefficient @xmath39 is much smaller than the galactic value ( say by an order of magnitude as is shown in figure  3 in paper  i ) . in this case , the results are not much different from the one with @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath51 from now on .",
    "note that @xmath39 is the diffusion coefficient outside a very narrow region around the shock where the coefficient could be close to the bohm limit and cr are accelerated to high energies",
    ". we do not explicitly solve cr acceleration there , and @xmath39 is generally much larger than the bohm limit .",
    "crs accelerated at the shock front are swept downward from the shock with the gas . in paper",
    "i , we considered only protons accelerated at the shock front ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in this study , we also investigate re - acceleration of crs in the galactic halo .",
    "thus , instead of giving @xmath41 at @xmath52 , we approximate distribution functions at the shock front , @xmath53 , based on a steady - state , test - particle solution about a plane shock . assuming that the crs are confined around the bubble , we can integrate a diffusion - convection equation between the far upstream region of the shock and @xmath52 . we obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the distribution function of the pre - existing crs , and @xmath56 is the compression ratio of the shock @xcite . from this equation",
    ", we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the normalization and @xmath59 is the lowest momentum , above which crs can cross the shock ; particles are not accelerated for @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the index is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mach number of the shock @xcite .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : fshock ] ) refers to the re - acceleration of crs advected into the shock from upstream region , and the second term represents crs accelerated from the thermal background plasma .",
    "the index @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the increasing function of time in our calculations .    for the injection of cr protons at the shock front",
    ", we adopt a thermal leakage model @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the downstream proton number density , @xmath67 is the thermal peak momentum of the downstream gas with a temperature of @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the proton mass , and @xmath70 is the boltzmann constant . here , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the downstream flow speed in the shock rest frame .",
    "the factor @xmath75 depends on the structure of magnetic fields and we take @xmath76 .",
    "the acceleration of the cr protons is limited by the age of the bubble .",
    "since the acceleration time must be smaller than the age , the maximum momentum is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the proton charge , @xmath79 is the background magnetic field , @xmath80 is the gyro factor , @xmath81 is the shock velocity , and @xmath82 is the bubble age @xcite .",
    "thus , for @xmath83 , equation  ( [ eq : fshock ] ) can not be applied and pre - existing crs are just advected downstream .",
    "the maximum momentum decreases as the bubble expands in our calculations .",
    "although electrons ( primary electrons ) should be accelerated at the shock front in the same way as protons , their injection is expected to be less efficient than that of protons .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the parameter .",
    "the lowest energy of accelerated electrons , @xmath86 , is the same as @xmath87 but @xmath69 in equation  ( [ eq : qinj ] ) is replaced by the electron mass @xmath88 .",
    "the maximum momentum of electrons is limited by cooling , mainly synchrotron emission and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "the maximum momentum is obtained by replacing @xmath89 in equation  ( [ eq : p0max ] ) by @xmath90 : @xmath91 we ignore positrons in the thermal plasma , and thus @xmath92 .",

    "the cr proton spectrum in the galactic disk is approximated by @xmath95 for @xmath96  gev and @xmath97 for @xmath98  gev , where @xmath99 is the energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cr proton spectrum in the galactic halo is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the parameter ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath103 , because cooling times of cr electrons and positrons are much shorter than the galactic age ( @xmath104  gyr , see figure  28 in @xcite ) and because they are not supplied in the halo .",
    "the background distribution functions are written as @xmath105    the production rates of secondary electrons and positrons ( @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively ) created through @xmath5-interaction between cr protons and gas protons are calculated using the code provided by @xcite and the gas density distribution obtained by hydrodynamic simulations ( section  [ sec : hydro ] ) . we do not consider re - acceleration of secondary electrons at the shock front because most of them are generated in the far downstream region of the shock and not in the vicinity of the shock . in order to calculate the cooling ( @xmath108 ) and radiative processes for electrons and positrons , we adopt the models of @xcite .",
    "we include synchrotron radiation , ic scattering , coulomb interaction , and bremsstrahlung . for ic scattering , we approximate the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) by four blackbody components at 2.7 , 35 , 3000 , and 7000  k. on the galactic rotation axis , their energy densities at 5  kpc away from the gc are @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the isrf data in galprop code show that the energy density of the isrf except for the cosmic microwave background component ( 2.7  k ) scales as @xmath113 along the rotation axis of the galaxy , where @xmath114 is distance from the gc .",
    "for the background magnetic fields outside of the bubble ( @xmath47 ) , we adopt a standard model in galprop with a lower limit : @xmath115\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath116 , and @xmath117  kpc . for @xmath118 , we assume that @xmath119 , because turbulence inside the bubble would increase magnetic fields",
    ". however , it is unlikely that the magnetic pressure @xmath120 exceeds the thermal pressure @xmath14 . in our calculation shown later in figure  [ fig : rho ] , they are comparable at @xmath121  myr , and @xmath122 at @xmath123  myr . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the cooling time of cr electrons responsible for synchrotron radiation ( @xmath124  ghz ) is comparable to the age of the bubble .",
    "we solve equation  ( [ eq : diff ] ) with a boundary condition @xmath125 at @xmath52 ( equation  ( [ eq : fshock ] ) ) .",
    "the gradient of @xmath126 is zero at the inner boundary ( @xmath127  kpc ) .",
    "the density @xmath12 and velocity @xmath13 of the background gas are obtained by solving equations  ( [ eq : cont])([eq : ene ] ) .",
    "we take the current time at @xmath128  myr .      in this subsection",
    ", we show the results for the fiducial model ( model  fd ) that gives almost the same results as the fiducial model in paper  i. we put a kinetic energy of @xmath129  erg at @xmath29 and @xmath130  kpc .",
    "we do not include the background crs escaped from the galactic disk ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "we consider only secondary electrons ( and positrons ) that are created through @xmath5-interactions , and we do not treat primary electrons that are directly accelerated at the shock front ( @xmath132 ) . from now on , the term electron includes positron unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "figure  [ fig : mach ] shows the evolution of the shock radius @xmath133 and the mach number @xmath62 .",
    "we start cr acceleration at @xmath134  myr . in paper",
    "i , we stopped the acceleration when @xmath135 , because although a shock with a decreasing mach number weakens the cr acceleration , the model did not include that effect explicitly . in this study , we include the effect by using equation  ( [ eq : finj0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , less - efficient acceleration continues even when @xmath135 . in figure",
    "[ fig : rho ] , we show the gas density ( assumed to be the thermal electron number density ) and temperature profiles for model  fd",
    ". the apparent size of the bubble @xmath136 ( degree ) is simply given by @xmath137 , where @xmath138  kpc is the distance to the gc .",
    "as the mach number of the shock decreases , the density and temperature jumps at the shock front also decrease .",
    "this effect was not included when we calculated the gamma - ray emission through @xmath5 interaction in paper  i. figure  [ fig : rho ] shows that some amount of gas remains even far behind the shock , because the initial gas profile ( at @xmath29 ) is centrally concentrated ( paper  i ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gamma_fd ] , we present the gamma - ray spectrum at @xmath139 for model  fd . the gamma - ray emission is originated from the @xmath0-decay process associated with the @xmath5-interaction .",
    "we show the results for @xmath140 and 2000 , which correspond to a large and a small @xmath141 , respectively ( equation  ( [ eq : p0max ] ) ) .",
    "since the result for @xmath142 is consistent with the observations , we adopt that value hereafter unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "note that @xmath143 is related to the small diffusion coefficient of crs in the vicinity of the shock where crs are accelerated .",
    "the coefficient there is @xmath80 times the bohm limit and is different from @xmath39 in equation  ( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "although the value of @xmath142 may be rather large compared with @xmath144 for supernova remnants in the galactic plane , we do not think that it is rejected for the _ fermi _ bubbles .",
    "we expect that seed magnetic fluctuations in the galactic halo are smaller than those in the galactic plane because of fewer sources of turbulence in the halo .",
    "this may prevent rapid growth of the fluctuations around the shock of the _ fermi _ bubbles and may result in a larger @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , the mach number of the shock of the _ fermi _ bubble ( figure  [ fig : mach ] ) is much smaller than that of supernova remnants in the galactic plane ( @xmath124100 ) .",
    "this would also lead to the increase of @xmath80 .",
    "the fairly hard spectra in figure  [ fig : gamma_fd ] are mostly created by the crs that are accelerated when @xmath145 is large , because the acceleration efficiency decreases as @xmath145 decreases . since the crs accelerated at a shock with a large @xmath62",
    "have a hard spectrum with a small @xmath63 ( equations  ( [ eq : fshock ] ) and  ( [ eq : q ] ) ) , the gamma - ray spectrum is also hard .",
    "the low energy part of the model spectrum ( @xmath146  gev ) does not fit the date well ( figure  [ fig : gamma_fd ] ) .",
    "this may be because our model overestimates low energy crs .",
    "alternatively , uncertainty of the data may be the reason as is shown by the discrepancy between the data by @xcite and those by @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sp_fd ] , we present the broad - band spectrum of non - thermal emission from the bubble at @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath0-decay gamma - rays come from the protons , while synchrotron , ic scattering , and non - thermal bremsstrahlung emissions come from the secondary electrons .",
    "while the predicted gamma - ray spectrum is generally consistent with the observations , the radio flux is smaller than that of the radio observations .",
    "the deficiency of the radio luminosity to the gamma - ray luminosity remains even if we change the background magnetic fields , because the luminosity ratio intrinsically depends on the ratio of the production rate of charged pions to that of neutral pions in the @xmath5-interaction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the given magnetic fields inside the bubble ( @xmath147 ) , the cooling time of electrons is comparable with the age of the bubble ( section  [ sec : cr ] ) .",
    "thus , smaller @xmath79 gives smaller synchrotron luminosity because the emissivity decreases .",
    "larger @xmath79 does not lead to larger synchrotron luminosity because radiative cooling reduces the number of high - energy electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig : pro_fd ] shows that the gamma - ray intensity profile is consistent with the observed profile .",
    "the former is calculated simply by projecting the gamma - ray emission on a plane at a distance of @xmath148  kpc and we do not consider detailed geometrical effects that come up when the distance to the _ fermi _ bubbles is finite . this is because we assumed the spherical symmetry and",
    "the size of the bubble is comparable to @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the detailed comparison with the observations may be premature .",
    "however , the line of sight cross section near the bubble edge , or the curvature of the bubble , does not much differ between a more realistic model considering the position of the sun ( e.g. figure  4 of @xcite ) and our model for a given bubble volume .",
    "since we do not include background gamma - rays , we shift the observational data along the vertical axis ( @xmath150 in the 15  gev band and @xmath151 in the 520  gev band ) .",
    "the brightness profile is fairly flat for @xmath152 , because the bubble is not empty of gas and the cr protons interact with the gas protons contained in the bubble ( figure  [ fig : rho ] , see also paper  i ) .",
    "the brightness rapidly decreases outside of the edge at @xmath153 , because the crs confined in the bubble and do not diffuse out ( see paper  i ) .",
    "another reason is that the gas density is high just behind the shock front ( figure  [ fig : rho ] ) .",
    "the gamma - ray edge is inside the shock front at @xmath154 ( figure  [ fig : rho ] ) .",
    "recent x - ray observations with _",
    "suzaku _ have shown that there is no clear temperature jump at the gamma - ray edge @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with this model prediction because the edge does not reflect the shock front . in figure",
    "[ fig : pro_fd ] , the radio intensity profile is flat and it is smaller than the gamma - ray one .",
    "recent analyses of _ wmap _ and _ planck _ data have revealed that the radio intensity profile is almost identical to the gamma - ray profile around the edge of the _ fermi _ bubbles ( figure  3 in @xcite and figure  10 in @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the predicted radio surface brightness falls short of the observed one .      in this subsection , we investigate re - acceleration of the crs in the galactic halo .",
    "since our model is rather simple and we know little about the amount of crs and their distribution in the galactic halo , we only focus on whether a significant amount of crs ( @xmath155 ) affect the results or not .",
    "we assume that the background crs are uniform for simplicity , because equation  ( [ eq : fshock0 ] ) assumes that the upstream crs are uniformly distributed .",
    "model  h05 is the same as model  fd but for @xmath156 . in figure",
    "[ fig : gamma_h ] , we present the gamma - ray spectrum for model  h05 .",
    "we ignore the emission from crs at @xmath157 .",
    "compared with model  fd ( figure  [ fig : gamma_fd ] ) , the gamma - ray flux at a few gev is larger in model  h05 .",
    "this is because the re - accelerated crs also contribute to the gamma - ray flux . in this model ,",
    "the galactic crs re - accelerated later with smaller @xmath141 and larger @xmath63 contribute more to the gamma - rays than the crs accelerated earlier from the background thermal gas with larger @xmath141 and smaller @xmath63 .",
    "thus , for @xmath158  gev , the gamma - ray spectrum is softer than that predicted in model  fd and the observations ( figures  [ fig : gamma_h ] and  [ fig : gamma_fd ] ) .",
    "the intensity profile is displayed in figure  [ fig : pro_h05 ] .",
    "the gamma - ray profile has a shape edge at @xmath159 ( figure  [ fig : pro_h05 ] ) , which corresponds to the position of the shock front at @xmath160  kpc ( figure  [ fig : rho ] ) .",
    "this means that there should be a temperature jump of a factor of three at the gamma - ray edge , which is inconsistent with the _ suzaku _ observations @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath161 ( model  h01 ) , the contribution from the re - accelerated crs becomes much smaller ( figures  [ fig : gamma_h ] and  [ fig : gamma_fd ] ) .",
    "this means that the density of the background crs at the position of the _ fermi _ bubbles ( @xmath16210  kpc above the galactic plane ) must be much smaller than that in the galactic disk .",
    "we study another re - acceleration model in which the gamma - rays from the _ fermi _ bubbles are totally attributed to the re - accelerated crs . in this model ( model  hs ) , the input energy at the gc is chosen so that the size of the gamma - ray bubble matches with the observed one .",
    "the crs accelerated from the thermal gas are not included ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "we take @xmath164  erg and @xmath156 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhohs ] shows the density and temperature profiles of the background halo gas . at @xmath165  myr , the shock front is at @xmath166  kpc and the mach number is @xmath167 . in figure",
    "[ fig : gamma_hs ] , we show the gamma - ray spectra for @xmath168 and 1 .",
    "as can be seen , they are not much different in the gev band . when @xmath140 , the spectrum is softer than that in model  fd at @xmath169  gev ( figures  [ fig : gamma_hs ] and  [ fig : gamma_fd ] ) . in model",
    "fd , the gamma - rays are largely originated from the crs accelerated from the thermal gas when @xmath170 is small or @xmath145 is large . in model",
    "hs , on the contrary , the crs re - accelerated when @xmath170 is large or @xmath145 is small contribute to the gamma - rays .",
    "thus , the gamma - ray spectrum is softer .",
    "although the gamma - ray profile reproduces the observations ( figure  [ fig : pro_hs ] ) , the predicted spectra in figure  [ fig : gamma_hs ] are softer than the observations at @xmath169  gev . in model",

    "the temperature jump of a factor of two at the shock front ( figure  [ fig : rhohs ] ) is larger than that measured with _ suzaku _ at the gamma - ray edge ( a factor of @xmath171 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even if we change @xmath172 and/or @xmath173 , we can not adjust the gamma - ray spectrum and the gas temperature profile with the observations at the same time .",
    "thus , we conclude that this model can not reproduce the observations .",
    "moreover , the surface brightness in the radio band is too small to be consistent with the observations ( figure  [ fig : pro_hs ] ) .      the models studied above can not explain the observed radio emission . in hadronic models ,",
    "the radio luminosity is essentially smaller than the gamma - ray luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "is shown in figure  [ fig : sp_el ] .",

    "[ fig : pro_el ] , we present the intensity profiles in the gamma - ray and radio bands . since the predicted radio profile is almost the same as the gamma - ray profile around the bubble edge , it is consistent with the observations @xcite .",

    "since @xmath63 in equation  ( [ eq : fshock ] ) is the increasing function of time , we can not ignore the contribution of lower - energy cr electrons ( @xmath184 ) that are recently accelerated at the shock to the ic scattering and bremsstrahlung emissions ( figure  [ fig : pro_el ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sp_els ] shows the spectra of model  els , which is the same as model  el but @xmath185 . while the ic luminosity is larger than that in model  el , the synchrotron luminosity is smaller and can not reproduce radio observations .",
    "we have studied non - thermal radiation from the _ fermi _ bubbles . in our model ,",
    "cr protons are accelerated at the forward shock of the bubbles .",
    "they produce gamma - rays and secondary cr electrons via @xmath5-interaction .",
    "we followed the evolution of the distribution functions of the crs .",
    "our fiducial model can reproduce the observed hard spectrum and flat intensity profile in the gamma - ray band , because most crs are accelerated at early times when the mach number of the shock is large and because the bubble is not empty of gas . in this model",
    ", the edge of the gamma - ray bubble does not correspond to the shock front .",
    "this is consistent with recent _ suzaku _ observations showing that there is no temperature jump at the edge .",
    "however , the predicted radio flux from secondary electrons is much smaller than the observations .    the galactic halo may be filled with background crs escaped from the galactic disk .",
    "thus , we investigated re - acceleration of those crs by the _ fermi _ bubbles .",
    "we found that the gamma - rays from the re - accelerated crs significantly affect the luminosity and the intensity profile , which may indicate that the density of the background crs in the halo is @xmath1% of that in the disk .",
    "although the observed gamma - ray intensity profile can be reproduced by a model in which only re - accelerated crs are included , the model contradicts the observed hard gamma - ray spectrum and the non - detection of x - ray temperature jump at the gamma - ray edge .",
    "since secondary electrons alone can not explain the observed radio luminosity , we include primary electrons that are accelerated from thermal plasma at the shock .",
    "we found that the radio intensity profile around the bubble edge can be reproduced if electrons are accelerated with an efficiency of @xmath186% of that of protons .",
