    "in recent years , as the rapid advances in biotechnology have markedly driven down the cost of microarray experiments , more and more large scale studies are carried out with heterogeneous samples , conveniently collected from subjects of different phenotypic characteristics and exposure histories .",
    "such microarray studies are considered observational rather than experimental in nature [ @xcite ] because the effects of confounding or correlation in covariates need to be properly handled .",
    "the sample complexity of such studies presents both opportunities and challenges to the analysis . considering the differential gene expression studies , with multifaceted sample characteristics ,",
    "one may explore more complex questions that are not possible with a more homogeneous sample such as the identification of differentially expressed ( de ) genes associated with not just one sample characteristic but multiple characteristics and/or their interactions .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated de genes associated with smoking as well as smoking @xmath0 gender interaction . in another study involving smokers and never smokers [ @xcite ] ,",
    "microarray data were obtained for an unbalanced lung airway epithelium sample involving different tissue sites from subjects of different gender , age and ethnicity .",
    "an interesting question is to identify de genes associated with either a single or multiple sample characteristics . to address these questions",
    ", one needs to quantify the strength of association between the expression of each gene and a set of sample characteristics .",
    "this differs from the gene set enrichment analysis [ @xcite ; @xcite ] , where the interest is to quantify the strength of association between a set of genes and a single sample characteristic .",
    "direct application of currently available approaches to these questions does not provide a coherent solution and has clear limitations .",
    "methods for identifying de genes are typically based on the ranking of statistics for between group differences associated with one sample characteristic ( also known as a factor or a covariate ) , such as the @xmath1- , @xmath2-statistics , their nonparametric counterparts , their modified forms , or the bayesian versions [ see @xcite for an excellent review of the various approaches ] .",
    "these methods are suited for well controlled experiments .",
    "their lack of control for confounding factors attracts increasing concern when applied to observational microarray studies [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] . with observational samples ,",
    "the results may be confounded by a variety of sample characteristics , such as age , sex , genetic profile , exposure and treatment history , etc .",
    ", which can lead to an increased number of false discoveries .",
    "recent studies by @xcite and @xcite suggested that hidden traces of unknown confounders may exist in de gene studies and that ranking statistics need to be adjusted accordingly . to account for the effects of possible confounders ,",
    "several approaches have been adapted from traditional observational studies and applied to microarray data [ @xcite ; @xcite ] , including adjustment via multiple regression on known confounders or on surrogate variables for unknown confounders [ @xcite ] , or via a matched study design [ @xcite ] .",
    "regardless of covariate adjustment , the aforementioned approaches rank the genes based on the effect sizes estimated using the same model , that is , a model with the same structure and same set of covariates , for all genes .",
    "such a single model approach can be problematic for high - dimensional microarray data because different genes may be involved in different biological processes and their expression may be affected by different sets of covariates . more specifically ,",
    "as shown in section  [ sec2 ] , such an approach leads to model misspecification for a certain proportion of the genes and does not offer the same level of accuracy and efficiency for the effect size estimation for genes under investigation .    to avoid model misspecification in microarray data analysis , an ideal solution could be to apply different models to different sets of genes whereby each model contains only the set of covariates relevant to the genes it is describing . identifying appropriate models for different sets of genes can be challenging because model uncertainty makes it difficult to identify a single best model .",
    "the bayesian model averaging ( bma ) approach offers an attractive alternative solution to this problem .",
    "@xcite provides a review of this approach in more traditional settings . in recent years",
    ", bma approaches have been developed to handle various problems involving high throughput genetic data .",
    "for example , they were used to improve the assessment of candidate gene effects in the genome - wide association studies [ @xcite ; @xcite ] and to improve sample classification using gene expression microarray data [ @xcite ] .",
    "they have also been shown to improve the de gene detection in settings where the microarray data involved two different distributional assumptions [ @xcite ] or were from different sources [ @xcite ] .",
    "all these approaches are computationally expensive , as mcmc simulation is used to obtain estimates of model parameters . in this study",
    ", we propose a bma approach for observational microarray studies based on linear regression models .",
    "it does not require mcmc simulations for estimating model parameters and offers a flexible and coherent framework to identify simultaneously de genes associated with a single factor , multiple factors and/or their interactions .    in the next section",
    "we discuss limitations of single model approaches .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the impact of model misspecification from such approaches on de gene finding .",
    "we also identify parameters that affect the magnitude of impact . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we propose to find de genes with a  bma approach that properly controls for sample heterogeneity and model uncertainty . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we compare the performances of ranking statistics based on a simple model , a complex model and the bma approach in simulated microarray studies .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] concludes with applications of bma to two existing microarray data sets .",
    "our analysis supports the utility of the bma method as a useful tool for capturing and quantifying the complex relationship between gene expression patterns and sample characteristics in observational microarray studies .",
    "[ section2 ] in this section we consider a general framework to describe gene expression variations in microarrays . under this framework",
    ", we argue that the single model approaches to de gene detection are overly simplified and subjected to the impact of model misspecification , for example , the omission of relevant covariates when a  simple model is used and the inclusion of irrelevant covariates when a complex model is used .",
    "the consequences of such model misspecification have been discussed extensively in the linear regression setting [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ; @xcite ] .",
    "the implication of these results , however , has not been fully investigated in de gene studies . in this section",
    "we evaluate the consequences of model misspecification from the single model approaches on performance measures often used in de gene studies , including the false discovery rate ( fdr ) and sensitivity .",
    "we conclude this section with a summary of the main results .",
    "we consider an observational microarray study which aims to identify de genes associated with different values of a factor @xmath3 , for example , cigarette smoking exposure .",
    "expression profiles of @xmath4 genes are obtained for @xmath5 subjects with different values of @xmath3 . without loss of generality , a typical model for identifying @xmath3 related de genes",
    "can be written as @xmath6 or @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the normalized and typically log - transformed expression level of gene @xmath9 in subject @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the factor level for @xmath12 in subject @xmath10 ; @xmath13 are levels for other factors , denoted by @xmath14 , that affect the expression of all the genes , for example , experimental parameters involved in the microarray experiments ; @xmath15 is the level of a potential confounding factor @xmath16 , for example , gender , age , race , alcohol exposure , etc . ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote normally distributed random errors .    to identify de genes related to @xmath3 , @xmath19-values based on @xmath1-statistic of estimate of either @xmath20 or @xmath21 can be used as the ranking statistics .",
    "if model ( [ model1 ] ) is used , the relevant @xmath1-statistic for gene @xmath9 is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the least square estimate of @xmath20 .",
    "if model ( [ model2 ] ) is used , the @xmath1-statistic for gene @xmath9 is calculated as @xmath24 .",
    "it can be shown that the two statistics are related as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the residual sum of squares , least square parameter estimates and residual , respectively , from the following auxiliary regression equation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the residual sum of squares for the auxiliary regression with @xmath12 as the outcome and @xmath32 as the covariates .    for an observational microarray study , such single model approach with or without covariate adjustment",
    "has an intrinsic limitation , that is , neither model can be the true model for all the genes .",
    "for the aforementioned hypothetical microarray study , model ( [ model1 ] ) is the true model only for genes not related to @xmath16 ( @xmath16 null genes , or @xmath33 genes ) , and model ( [ model2 ] ) is the true model only for genes related to @xmath16 ( @xmath16 de genes , or @xmath34 genes ) . based on these considerations , a multi - model approach that uses @xmath19-values of @xmath35 to rank the @xmath33 genes and @xmath19-values of @xmath36 to rank the @xmath34 genes is preferable .",
    "the performance difference between the single model and the multi - model approaches can be compared by utilizing the relationship between the two @xmath1-statistics .",

    "the density distribution of the ranking statistics can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the proportion of @xmath34 genes . @xmath41 and @xmath42 can further be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the proportions of de genes in @xmath33 and @xmath34 genes , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are distributions of the test statistic for the null and de genes , respectively . for a given cutoff @xmath48 , the false discovery rate and sensitivity can be calculated as @xmath49 }    { ( 1-f)[1-f_1(c)]+ f[1-f_2(c ) ] }   \\nonumber   \\\\[-8pt ]   \\\\[-8pt ]    & & { } + \\frac{f(1-p_2)[1-f_{20}(c)]}{(1-f)[1-f_1(c)]+ f[1-f_2(c ) ] } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath50 + 2fp_2[1-f_{21}(c)].\\vadjust{\\goodbreak}\\ ] ] we discuss the impact of the two single model approaches on the fdr and sensitivity separately .      when model ( [ model1 ] ) is used , the fdr can be written as @xmath51 } { ( 1-f)[1-f_1(c)]+ f[1-f^{m_1}_2(c)]}\\\\ & & { } + \\frac{f(1-p_2)[1-f^{m_1}_{20}(c ) ] } { ( 1-f)[1-f_1(c)]+ f[1-f^{m_1}_2(c)]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sensitivity can be written as @xmath52 + 2fp_2[1-f^{m_1}_{21}(c)].\\ ] ] superscript @xmath33 is used to denote that the distribution of @xmath1-statistic is derived from model ( [ model1 ] ) , which is misspecified for the @xmath34 genes because of omitting relevant covariate @xmath16 .",
    "omission of relevant covariate leads to bias in the model parameter estimates [ @xcite ] .",
    "specifically , the bias can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the least square estimate of the parameter associated with @xmath12 in the auxiliary regression ( [ aux ] ) .",

    "however , for the @xmath34 null genes , the above results indicate @xmath63 , that is , the distribution of @xmath64 for the @xmath34 null genes moves away from zero .",

    "the relationship of the two @xmath1-statistics can be written as @xmath85 it is known that , with the inclusion of an irrelevant covariate , model ( [ model2 ] ) does not result in a biased parameter estimate for the @xmath86 genes . however , since @xmath87 in general , @xmath88 for @xmath33 de genes .",
    "therefore , the distribution @xmath89 moves toward 0 and results in @xmath90 , that is , reduced sensitivity in detecting de genes in @xmath33 genes . as @xmath91 in general is likely to be greater than @xmath92 , @xmath93 also shrinks toward 0 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath94 will be comparable to @xmath70 .",
    "hence , reduced sensitivity in detecting de genes in @xmath33 genes will be the main consequence resulted from applying the complex model for all the genes .",
    "the above results suggested that the single model approaches with or without covariate adjustment can lead to inferior performance .",
    "it is expected that the impact on fdr and sensitivity could be greater if more @xmath16-like covariates exist in the sample .",
    "these results will be further demonstrated in the simulation study .",
    "the above discussion also suggested that the performance for de gene detection can be improved by applying the correct model for the right sets of genes .",
    "yet , such knowledge is commonly not available beforehand . in the following section , we propose a bma approach as a practical substitute for the multi - model approach for de gene detection that takes into account both sample heterogeneity and model uncertainty .",
    "in this section we discuss an efficient bayesian model averaging approach to identifying de genes associated with a covariate of interest .",
    "the methodology proposed in this paper is closely related to methods discussed in @xcite and we largely follow their notation .",
    "consider a series of possible models for describing the expression pattern of each gene .",
    "let @xmath95 be a binary vector of length @xmath96 , with each element indicating the inclusion status of the @xmath97th covariate in the model , that is , @xmath98 each model in the model space can then be labeled by @xmath99 , namely , @xmath100 . for gene",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath101 , the model can be written as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the intercept term ; @xmath104 is the submatrix of @xmath105 consisting of columns associated with nonzero @xmath106 ; @xmath107 and @xmath108 are parameters under this model .    the marginal posterior inclusion probability for variable @xmath109 and gene @xmath9 , is then defined as @xmath110 which is the sum of posterior probabilities of all models that include the covariate of interest .",
    "it quantifies the strength of association between covariate  @xmath109 and the expression level of the @xmath9th gene and can be used to rank the de genes .",
    "the posterior model probability for @xmath111 can be calculated based on bayes factors of pairs of models , for example , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the prior model probability for genes measured in the microarray experiment and the bayes factor @xmath114 is defined as @xmath115 that is , the ratio of marginal likelihood under @xmath111 and the base model ,  @xmath116 . here",
    "the null model ( i.e. , the model with only the intercept term ) is used as the base model . for @xmath111 ,",

    "@xcite have shown that this prior resolves several consistency issues associated with fixed @xmath121-priors while retaining several attractive properties such as adaptivity , good shrinkage properties , robustness to the misspecification of @xmath121 and fast marginal likelihood calculation . when comparing two nested models as in our case , a flat prior",
    "is placed on common coefficients , ( @xmath103 , @xmath108 ) , where @xmath122 , and a cauchy prior on the remaining parameters , @xmath107 .",

    "this quantity can be obtained through direct numerical integration or through the laplace approximation .",
    "in addition to the prior @xmath120 on model parameters , one must also choose a prior on the models themselves , which relates directly to multiplicity .",
    "@xcite discussed several prior model probability choices regarding their effects on multiplicity - control for multiple models in a  conventional bayesian model selection / averaging setting involving one outcome variable . with the high throughput data , typically , the prior model probabilities should reflect our prior belief about the distribution of the models among the genes in the transcriptome , which can be difficult to quantify . a uniform prior assumed equal probabilities of the models can be problematic when thousands of genes are evaluated simultaneously because it puts an unrealistically low weight to the null model . when the resulting posterior model probabilities are used to estimate the posterior expected fdr ( _ _ pe__fdr ) [ @xcite",
    "] , great underestimation can occur [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . correctly estimating fdr under the bayesian framework",
    "remains an active research field [ @xcite ] .",
    "recent discussions and attempts have largely been focused on statistics derived from single model approaches [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . in our case ,",
    "proper control for multiplicity derived from multiple genes and multiple models becomes even more challenging .",
    "we believe that the prior should lead to a reasonably well calibrated posterior model probability that measures the model s ability for describing the data .",
    "we propose an empirical approach to obtain estimates for the prior model probabilities , @xmath113 , under the assumption that the prior probabilities of a given model are the same across genes , that is , @xmath130 .",
    "we first estimate the proportion of de genes described by a nonnull model  @xmath131 , @xmath132 , using bayes factors .",
    "since @xmath133 , @xmath134 suggests evidence against the null model [ @xcite ] , we can estimate @xmath132 as follows : @xmath135}\\cdot          { \\bf 1}_{[\\mathit{bf}(\\mathcal{m}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}j}\\dvtx            \\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbf{0}j})>c]},\\ ] ] where @xmath136 is a vector of null - based bayes factors for gene @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , @xmath132 represents the proportion of genes for which model @xmath131 is the best model in terms of bayes factors .",
    "given that bayes factors based on the zellner ",
    "siow prior are consistent for model selection whether or not the true model is null [ @xcite ] , this estimator is a consistent estimator of the proportion of genes expressing in a pattern specified by the model . in our simulation studies",
    ", we found that fixing @xmath137 at 1 resulted in @xmath132 being close to the truth in most settings .",
    "second , we argue that if the prior model probabilities , @xmath138 , result in the equality between the overall @xmath139fdr under @xmath100 and @xmath140 , reasonable calibration of the posterior model probabilities can be achieved .",
    "this suggests the following relationship between @xmath138 and @xmath132 , that is , @xmath141 hence , @xmath138 can be obtained by iteratively updating the following equation : @xmath142}\\cdot      { \\bf 1}_{[\\mathit{bf}(\\mathcal{m}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}j}\\dvtx          \\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbf{0}j})>c ] } } {      \\sum_{j}[\\mathit{bf}(\\mathcal{m}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}j}\\dvtx \\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbf{0}j})/      \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}'}\\mathit{bf}(\\mathcal{m}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}'j}\\dvtx      \\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbf{0}j } ) p^{(l-1)}(\\mathcal{m}_{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}'})]}\\ ] ] under the constraint @xmath143 , where @xmath144 denotes the iteration step . in our experience ,",
    "30 iterations were adequate to result in convergence . at present stage ,",
    "theoretical justification for this prior choice for multiplicity control is still lacking .",
    "we resort to the simulation study to show that this prior choice led to improved performance in both the ranking of the genes and in direct fdr estimation compared with the uniform prior .",
    "simulation studies were designed to compare the single model approaches with and without covariate adjustment and the `` gold standard '' multiple - model approach with the correct covariate adjustments , as well as the performance of bma over single - model approaches when a multi - model approach is appropriate .",

    "on the other hand , the difference in fdr contributed from the @xmath262 genes remained small .",
    "hence , the results suggested that bias in effect estimation among genes associated with the confounders was the main cause for the fdr increase . @xmath168 and @xmath176 showed slightly greater fdr compared to @xmath183 .",

    "as discussed in the previous sections , given the existence of genes associated with various sample characteristics , single model approaches were subjected to the effects of increased bias or reduced power in unbalanced study design . for the epithelium microarray data , we saw large differences in gene rankings derived from the bma approach and the three single model approaches . among the top 1000 smoking related de genes identified by each method ,",

    "these differences were driven by the genes whose expression patterns were not properly captured by the single model .",
    "the higher agreement between results from @xmath268 and @xmath260 reflects the fact that a large proportion of the @xmath283 related de genes are associated with @xmath283 only .      the second data set came from a study with a total of 79 age and gender matched healthy smokers and never smokers [ @xcite ] .",
    "the microarray analyses were carried out on oral mucosa samples obtained from these subjects through buccal biopsies .",

    "the analysis was carried for the expression data of the 12911 genes . for subjects recruited for this study , information regarding age ,",
    "gender and smoking status was available .",
    "the study samples were balanced in terms of gender between smokers and nonsmokers .",
    "therefore , single model approaches with or without adjustment for gender would provide similar results .",
    "however , one interesting biological question was whether there were genes affected by smoking differently between the males and females",
    ". in this context , direct application of the single model approach could lead to confusing results .",
    "for example , at 5% estimated fdr , the single model without adjustment for the interaction term resulted in 944 hits for association with @xmath283 , while the model adjusted for both @xmath285 and @xmath288 interaction led to the identification of only 1 gene as hits for association with @xmath283 and no genes were identified as hits for @xmath289 interaction .",
    "such large difference in de gene assessment between different models is difficult to reconcile and interpret under the single model framework . yet",
    ", such difference can be expected if there are genes associated with the interaction because the two variables , @xmath283 and @xmath290 interaction , are correlated .",
    "joint testing of the effects of @xmath283 and @xmath289 interaction led to the identification of 311 de genes with the likelihood ratio test .",
    "however , this method can not quantify the relative contribution from the two variables .",
    "we therefore applied the bma approach to these data to illustrate the flexibility and usefulness of this approach to handle possible interaction effects .    in this application ,",
    "the model space consists of a total of 16 models including the null model , three models with @xmath283 and/or @xmath285 as main effects only and 12 models for different patterns that could arise from interaction between @xmath283 and @xmath285 . for the oral mucosa data ,",
    "our analysis estimated that about 22.5% of the genes are differentially expressed , in which about 12.3% , 1.5% and 8.6% were associated with @xmath283 , @xmath285 and @xmath289 interaction , respectively . controlling the _ _ pe__fdr at 5% ,",
    "our approach identified a total of 414 genes as hits associated with smoking through either the main effect , the interaction effect or both .",
    "specifically , 222 of these genes were associated with @xmath283 primarily through the main effect , 2 were associated with @xmath283 primarily through the interaction effect , while for the rest of these genes various degrees of association were contributed from the interaction term .",

    "as one of the primary tools for such studies , methods for finding de genes have also been refined over time .",
    "various approaches have been proposed to deal with multiple issues in microarray data . yet , from the modeling perspective",
    ", many approaches have ignored sample heterogeneity , its impact on the analysis results , and the great opportunity it presents . since @xcite discussed the need for controlling bias and confounding in observational microarray studies , it has been increasingly recognized that the lack of control for sample heterogeneity could be a barrier to the reproducibility of the study findings . in two editorials [ @xcite ; @xcite ] ,",
    "improved data analysis methods and better study design have been considered crucial for advancing the field of cancer epidemiology with microarray technology .",
    "in particular , @xcite discussed the potential of model selection strategies in the process .",
    "nevertheless , there remain obstacles to fully appreciate the effect of complex sample characteristics on de gene detection and the value of improving upon current approaches .    in this paper , we proposed a novel concept for high throughput data analysis involving a heterogeneous sample , that is , a multi - model handling is intrinsically needed .",
    "we presented the theoretical framework that explains why basing inferences on a single model could be problematic in observational microarray studies .",
    "the problem arises from the inadequacy of using a single model to describe the complex expression pattern of genes among a  heterogeneous sample , which can result in increased number of false discoveries due to bias when a simple model is used or increased random error due to reduced efficiency when a complex model is used .",
    "such effects of model misspecification are hard to avoid because of the existence of genes being affected by different sets of sample characteristics and/or their interactions .",
    "we showed through simulation that the single model approaches have inferior performance in de gene finding in comparison with a multi - model approach should we know the right model for the right set of genes .",
    "the magnitude of effects on false discovery depends on the study design , specific biological system and the mechanism underlying expression variation .",
    "we proposed to use the bma approach to improve our ability to identify de genes .",

    ". another choice could be the hyper-@xmath296 prior proposed in @xcite .",
    "we proposed to use an iterative procedure to obtain the prior model probabilities so that the estimated distribution of the genes among the model space based on posterior model probabilities matches the estimate based on the bayes factors .",
    "these prior choices allow the efficient computation of the bayes factors and the posterior inclusion probabilities that does not rely on a mcmc simulation .",
    "our simulation study demonstrated that this approach performed almost as well as the gold standard multi - model approach with true models and better than the single model approaches in gene ranking .",
    "the ranking performance was relatively insensitive to a wide range of choice for prior model probabilities . however , accuracy of the fdr directly estimated from the posterior model / inclusion probabilities was sensitive to the prior choice .",
    "our simulation study showed that the proposed empirical prior model probability allowed for reasonably good calibration of posterior model / inclusion probabilities for multiplicity and the estimated fdr was close to the true fdr in settings with moderate to large sample size . in the rare case of a small study with a heterogeneous sample , care needs to be taken when using the empirical prior because the small sample size property of the zellner ",
    "siow prior is less certain .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that multiplicity control in the bayesian modeling framework remains a challenging and active research area .",
    "further studies on the theoretical aspects of the prior choice for multiplicity control across the multiple genes and multiple models are needed .",
    "the current bma approach is developed under the m - complete assumption , that is , the model space contains the true model . should unknown confounders exist , it is possible to capture the latent confounding factors by introducing the surrogate variables [ @xcite ] .",
    "we note , however , it would be unwise to directly incorporate the surrogate variables , currently constructed based on residuals derived from a single model fit of the data , into the proposed bma approaches .",
    "our work relies on the assumption of linear regression models with normal errors , which may be violated in practice .",
    "this calls for new approaches that are robust to the normality assumption , which is likely to be particularly useful for studies with small sample sizes . for the analysis of conventional data with one outcome variable , robust bayesian model selection / averaging approaches",
    "have been suggested , for example , the approach by @xcite .",
    "extending such ideas to the observational microarray studies represents an interesting future direction .",
    "finally , through the application of the bma approach to an observational mircoarray study with unbalanced study design and one with balanced study design , we showed that complex expression patterns did exist when study samples were heterogeneous .",
    "previous research has demonstrated the complexities of underlying biological mechanisms for gene expression variation .",
    "genes affected by several common factors , such as age [ @xcite ] , gender [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] , smoking [ @xcite ] and drinking alcohol [ @xcite ] , have been found in different tissue samples .",
    "our study showed that such complexity interfered with the de gene detection .",
    "notably , the bma approach was able to avoid missing important genes whose expression patterns were not adequately captured by a single model approach .",
