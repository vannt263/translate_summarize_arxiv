    "the observation of a high - mobility electron gas at the interface of laalo@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 @xcite has attracted great interest due to the variety of possibilities of controlling and modifying the properties of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system @xcite . due to the large dielectric constant of the srtio@xmath2 substrate , the carrier density and mobility of the 2d electron gas can be tuned by applying a gate voltage either across the substrate @xcite or , in a less easy implementation , by depositing the gate on top of the thin upper laalo@xmath2 layer .",
    "such electric field effect can be used in order to modulate the electron density and hence the superconductivity @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been shown by magnetotransport experiments @xcite that the electron gas in latio@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 heterostructures is composed of two types of carriers , a majority of low mobility carriers that are always present and high - mobility ones which induce superconductivity upon injection with positive gating . in the latter regime ,",
    "an analysis of the resistivity @xmath3 has revealed pronounced tails in the @xmath3 _ vs. _ temperature curves @xcite .",
    "these tails can be understood with the assumption of an inhomogeneous superconducting order parameter distribution @xcite .",
    "naturally , the low dimensionality of the electron gas emphasizes the role of disorder which unavoidably is created during the growing process , like , e.g. , oxygen vacancies .",
    "however , it has been proposed @xcite that the strong rashba spin - orbit ( rso ) interaction may also provide an intrinsic mechanism for the occurrence of electronic phase separation ( ps ) .",
    "this point of view is supported by the observation of a negative compressibility @xcite in strongly charge depleted laalo@xmath2/srtio@xmath2 interfaces where the effect seems to go beyond the standard contribution from exchange interactions in a 2d electron gas .",
    "ps together with frustration due to disorder would then be responsible for the formation of mesoscopic superconducting islands embedded in a ( weakly localizing ) metallic background . the mutual phase coherence between neighboring islands",
    "would then generate a low - dimensional percolative superconducting network which is compatible with the observation of tailish @xmath4 curves @xcite .    from a formal point of view ,",
    "the investigation of ref .",
    "@xcite was restricted to an analysis of the chemical potential _ vs. _ electron density , and it was subsequently extended investigating the role of temperature and magnetic field in restoring the homogeneous electronic state @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that upon increasing the rso a negative slope corresponding to a ps instability can be induced which is equivalent to a divergence of the density - density response function at zero transferred momentum .",
    "naturally the question arises whether this mechanism is more general and can even lead to finite momentum instabilities .",
    "it is exactly this problem which we intend to analyze in the present paper .    in this context",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite within a multiband model , that scattering processes between the nested regions of rashba split subbands may induce a variety of competing phases . in case of a conventional ( attractive ) pairing",
    "these include also charge density waves competing with conventional superconductivity . here",
    "we will demonstrate that charge - density wave instabilities can also be driven by a density - dependent rso interaction which for the sake of simplicity will be analyzed within a one - band model .",
    "in order to describe the electronic structure of the interface electron gas we consider a 2d lattice model with strong rashba coupling described by the hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath5    with @xmath6 . here , the first term describes the kinetic energy of electrons on a square lattice ( with lattice constant @xmath7 ) and we only take hopping between nearest - neighbors into account ( @xmath8 for @xmath9 , and @xmath10 otherwise ) .",
    "the second term is the rso coupling , where @xmath11 denotes the @xmath12-component ( @xmath13 ) of the spin - current flowing on the bond between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the coupling constants obey the relation @xmath17 . the last term in eq .",
    "[ eq : ham ] ensures the local density fixed to @xmath18 via the local chemical potential @xmath19 which will become important below when we deal with density - dependent rso couplings .",
    "note that for homogeneous coupling constants @xmath20 the rso term takes the usual form in momentum space    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the 2d lattice dispersion law .",
    "thus a constant @xmath24 reproduces the customary @xmath25 form of the rso interaction .",
    "the rso coupling constants depend on the electric field @xmath26 perpendicular to the 2d electron gas . following refs . @xcite and @xcite , we argue that the electric field is determined by the charge density in the layer thus yielding a dependence of the rso coupling constant on the charge density . for the present purpose ,",
    "it is important to note that this dependency is a local one , i.e. , a local charge fluctuation will locally alter the electric field and thus also locally change the rso coupling constant .",
    "we therefore set @xmath27 and since by symmetry @xmath28 we consider the following coupling @xmath29 note that in ref .",
    "@xcite a more general form of the density - dependent coupling has been considered which saturates at large densities . here",
    "we abstain from this extension , in order to keep the number of parameters to a minimum .",
    "however , the following instability analysis can be straightforwardly extended to general density - dependent rso couplings which will induce the formation of electronic inhomogeneities and thus concomitant variations in the local chemical potential .",
    "the latter can be obtained self - consistently by minimizing the energy with respect to the local density @xmath30 which yields @xmath31 a few words are now in order to account for the introduction of the lagrange multiplier field @xmath32 . in general the thermodynamic properties of fermionic systems",
    "are more easily calculated in the grand - canonical ensemble , defined by the potential @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the free energy and @xmath35 the total particle number of the system . in this ensemble",
    "the chemical potential is fixed while the particle density ( per unit cell ) @xmath36 is a fluctuating quantity ( @xmath37 is the number of lattice sites ) .",
    "therefore , when we calculate the chemical potential via the density - dependent grand - canonical potential , the density [ and therefore also @xmath38 is not known a priori .",
    "an elegant way to circumvent this problem is the introduction of a lagrange multiplier @xmath39 as was done in ref . @xcite . in the present non - homogeneous case",
    "we proceed similarly and we take the energy to be dependent on a real parameter @xmath18 , determine the local chemical potential @xmath40 , and then chose @xmath32 to impose @xmath41 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc ] ) .    if we insert the lagrange parameter eq .",
    "( [ eq : sc ] ) in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : ham ] the energy functional reads as @xmath42 with @xmath43and the notation @xmath44 refers to the coupling at a given density .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) it becomes apparent that the density - dependent coupling induces an effective density - current interaction .",
    "assume that the problem has been solved for a given homogeneous density ( in the following , we take densities and currents as site independent ) .",
    "then , one can obtain the instabilities of the system from the expansion of the energy in the small fluctuations of the density matrix in momentum space @xmath45    the fluctuations are given by @xmath46 and the instabilities can now be determined from a standard random phase approximation ( rpa ) . for this purpose",
    "we introduce response functions @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 refer to the fluctuations defined above .",
    "the non - interacting susceptibilities can be obtained from the eigenstates of the rashba hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) . denoting the response functions in matrix form @xmath50 and the interaction , derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltae ] ) as @xmath51 the full rpa response is given by @xmath52 the instabilities can thus be obtained from the zeros of the determinant @xmath53 .    here , the element @xmath54 is proportional to the compressibility , i.e. , within our sign convention , proportional to the inverse of @xmath55 .",
    "a ( locally ) stable system thus corresponds to @xmath56 whereas an unstable system is characterized by @xmath57 .",
    "analogously , a charge density wave ( cdw ) instability is signalled by a divergence in @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the momentum which becomes unstable upon entering the symmetry - broken cdw phase .",
    "we also note that a non - linear dependency of the rso coupling on densities would generate an additional density - density type contribution to the interaction matrix , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , in our calculations we fix the constant part of the rso coupling in eq .",
    "[ eq : coup ] to @xmath61 .",
    "the stability of the system is then analyzed in the @xmath62 parameter space where @xmath63 is the electron density ( per unit cell ) and @xmath64 is the component of the rso interaction which couples to the density [ cf . eq .",
    "( [ eq : coup ] ) ] .     vs. electron density plane with fixed @xmath65 .",
    "the range where only the lower rso - split band is occupied corresponds to the black circles . above @xmath66",
    "both rso - split bands are occupied ( red squares ) .",
    "both , circles and squares indicate the transition towards a long - wave length cdw whereas diamonds refer to a @xmath67 instability .",
    "inset : characteristic momentum of the density instability vs. electron density.,width=302 ]    our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which , in the main panel , reports the instability line . up to @xmath68 ( circles ) it separates a homogenous fermi liquid from a long - wave length cdw where both @xmath64 and the cdw modulation @xmath69 increase continuously with @xmath63 ( lower right inset ) . in the range @xmath70 ( squares ) @xmath69 drops",
    "discontinuously to a value of @xmath71 and is only weakly density - dependent .",
    "also the slope of the instability line @xmath64 _ vs. _ @xmath63 decreases only weakly with the electron density .",
    "finally , one enters a ps regime above @xmath72 ( diamonds ) where the unstable momentum discontinuosly jumps to @xmath73 identifying a spinodal line with divergent compressibility .",
    "this proximity between the finite-@xmath74 instability and the spinodal line indicates that long - wavelength cdw fluctuations are naturally accompanied by soft density fluctuations at @xmath75 and _ vice versa_.     and inverse effective interaction @xmath76 in the low density regime .",
    "the lower right inset shows the full density - density response and the upper left inset the bands .",

    "( [ eq : rpa ] ) , this latter includes all the current - current and mixed current - density processes . therefore @xmath84 describes the density - density interaction effectively mediated by all different fluctuations .",
    "the correlation function @xmath80 is then formally determined from a standard rpa - like expression @xmath85 fig .",

    "since we are considering a lattice model small anisotropies in the correlation functions appear already at low density and favor the appearance of the instability along the diagonal @xmath77 direction .",

    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath90 . due to the reduced value of @xmath93",
    "the constant part of @xmath88 is now limited to small momenta beyond which enhanced interband scattering induces an almost linear increase of the charge density susceptibility .",
    "the nesting peak at @xmath89 is now much less pronounced since the curvatures of the fermi surfaces at @xmath94 and @xmath93 become more different with increasing density . as a consequence @xmath76 touches @xmath88 in the quasi - linear regime which causes the appearance of a broad peak in the full charge correlation function ( right inset to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) whereas the nesting peak is only visible as a small feature at @xmath95 .",
    "the unstable momentum hardly changes with @xmath63 and is located along the vertical ( horizontal ) direction of the brillouin zone .",
    "finally , when the chemical potential enters the upper rso split band for @xmath96 , another discontinuous transition occurs towards a @xmath73 instability .",
    "the bare charge correlation function @xmath82 ( cf .",
    "main panel of fig .",

    "the full charge correlations @xmath80 ( lower left inset to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) still shows an enhancement at the incommensurate momentum @xmath99 , however , the divergence is now clearly shifted to @xmath73 . as analyzed further below , this instability corresponds to a local maximum which develops in @xmath100 upon increasing @xmath101 , so that the static compressibility @xmath102 diverges .",
    "but for parameters @xmath103 , @xmath65 , @xmath104.,width=302 ]",
    "the occurrence of electronic ps is locally signaled by the divergence of the compressibility @xmath102 marking the spinodal instability line .     as a function of electron density ( solid ) .",
    "the dashed line reports the maxwell construction and the point of contact ( square ) with @xmath105 indicates the global transition to ps .",
    "inset : chemical potential as a function of electron density .",
    "the minimum , which indicates the local instability point towards ps , corresponds to the point of inflection in @xmath105 and is indicated by a circle .",
    "the dotted line sketches the the behavior in case of a multiband structure as discussed in the text .",
    "parameters : @xmath65 , @xmath106.,width=302 ]     but for larger coupling @xmath107 .",
    "the upper right inset shows the ps instability ( green triangles ) together with the transitions towards cdw order as already reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1].,width=302 ]    however , the real ps region is found by implementing the maxwell construction , which identifies the broader parameter region where the system no longer is formed by a single homogeneous phase . the most natural way to perform",
    "the maxwell construction is by the tangent construction to the free energy , which bypasses the unstable region where the free energy has a wrong concavity , finding a region with lower free energy realized as a linear superposition of two stable phases with different densities .",
    "however , to implement this procedure when various phases are present , one should know the free energy of the various phases and refer to the lowest one in each region of the phase diagram .",
    "unfortunately , this program is rather difficult when incommensurate phases are present , which make the calculation of the ( meta)stable phases a non - trivial task .",
    "therefore , we will investigate the impact of the maxwell construction on the phase diagram , by only considering the free energy of the uniform phase .",
    "we are aware that at low density the stable phases have an incommensurate cdw order ( order parameter @xmath108 ) , which lowers the free energy by @xmath109 .",
    "this would of course modify the boundaries of the maxwell construction , which should determine the ps between a uniform phase at high density and a cdw phase at low density .",
    "nevertheless we find it instructive to perform the maxwell construction in this approximate way to extract still valuable estimates on the size and structure of the phase separated regions of the phase diagram .",

    "[ fig6 ] . upon increasing the coupling",
    "@xmath101 the corresponding touching points move along the solid line labeled ps in the lower right inset to fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .    for completeness , we point out that upon further increasing @xmath101 and when the chemical potential has entered the upper rso - split band , the @xmath112 _ vs. _ @xmath63 curve develops another minimum . at the transition",
    "the inflection point with @xmath113 corresponds to the divergent compressibility and @xmath114 instability which is reported by squares in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this high - density case ,",
    "the maxwell construction requires two tangent lines to the free energy which for @xmath107 are shown in fig . [ fig7 ] . coming from large density",
    "the system tends to phase separate between @xmath115 ( cf .",
    "squares in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and the other touching point of the tangent at @xmath72 .",
    "this density marks the upper boundary of a tiny stable region which is bound from below by the tangent which connects to @xmath116 . the ps line , which is shown in the upper right inset to fig .",

    "in particular , we have found that within our model the global transition towards ps is in close vicinity to a second order cdw instability so that ps is accompanied by significant long - wavelength charge fluctuations .",
    "our investigations generalize the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , where phases with negative compressibility have been evaluated for a 2d electron gas as realized in oxide heterostructures .",
    "typically these 2d electron gases are formed at the interfaces between two oxides consisting , respectively , of polar [ e.g. , ( lao)@xmath117 and ( alo@xmath118)@xmath119 and non - polar [ e.g. , tio@xmath118 and sro ] layers , with typical electron densities ( per unit cell ) @xmath120 . in this regard",
    ", a proper description of the electronic states should at least take into account the multiband structure due to the splitting of ti@xmath121 t@xmath122 bands at the interface . according to the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite the system is in general stable when the chemical potential falls in the light mass lower isotropic band of mainly @xmath123 character whereas a ps instability may occur when the gating potential shifts the fermi energy into the higher anisotropic @xmath124 and @xmath125 bands .",
    "our present results refer to a model hamiltonian that can be considered as an effective model for these higher energy active bands .",
    "in fact , the rso coupling used in our analysis compares well with standard values ( see .",
    "@xcite ) when the hopping parameter is derived from the dispersion of these active bands @xcite .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] anticipates then the behavior of the chemical potential ( dotted line ) in case of an additional stable lower energy band with @xmath126 .",
    "this implies that the lower bound of the phase separated regime as determined by a standard maxwell construction is no longer at @xmath116 as in our one - band model : the tangent of the maxwell construction would connect to a density in the stable lower band . on the other hand ,",
    "it is conceivable that the implementation of anisotropic active bands supports the occurence of cdw instabilities which then in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] would still be the leading transition at small density",
    ".    it would therefore be interesting to explore possible realizations of these instabilities in an unrestricted multiband model .",
    "it might well be that the combination of ps and long - wave length charge instabilities leads to a kind of correlated disorder which is compatible with the existence of tails in the sheet resistance curves of oxide interfaces below the superconducting transition temperature @xcite .",
