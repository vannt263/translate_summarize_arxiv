    "it is well - known that the frictional resistance is independent of the apparent area of the sliding surface and it is proportional to the normal load with a proportional constant @xmath0 , which is known as the friction coefficient . traditionally , the friction coefficient has two distinct values : the static friction coefficient @xmath1 , determined from the minimum force needed to move a slider at rest , and the dynamic friction coefficient @xmath2 , used for the friction force when a steady sliding motion is established .",
    "friction is often described using the well - known amontons - coulomb s laws : ( @xmath3 ) both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent of the apparent area of the contacting surfaces and the normal load ; ( @xmath4 ) both @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on the shear characteristics of the contacting materials @xcite ; ( @xmath5 ) for most cases , @xmath2 is appreciably lower than @xmath1 .",
    "this standard picture is still widely accepted nowadays ; however , in many cases , significant refinements must be taken into account for the explanation of the observed friction .",
    "our common experiences tell us that the sliding of contact bodies subjected to a steady pulling velocity sometimes proceeds in an alternation of periods of rest and slide rather than moving steadily ( this is the reason , for example , for the occurrence of squeaking noises ) .",
    "this unstable motion consists of periods of a stick state followed by a sudden slip is known as stick - slip oscillations .",
    "the stick - slip motion occurs on both large and small scales .",
    "understanding stick - slip phenomenon is not only important for many engineering applications , but also for understanding the mechanism of earthquakes ( which is a stick - slip phenomenon at geological scale @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , stick - slip is caused by the variation of frictional resistance during sliding . in certain range of the velocity @xmath6",
    ", a velocity weakening behavior ( corresponding to a decreasing function @xmath7 with respect to the steady relative sliding velocity @xmath6 of the contact surfaces ) is often observed in many different materials including metals @xcite and rocks @xcite . in this range , which generally lies in low - velocity regime ,",
    "the steady motion is unstable with respect to perturbation ; this gives rise to stick - slip phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "the static friction coefficient @xmath1 is generally found to be an increasing function with respect to the contact age of contact surfaces @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the plastic relaxation of the stressed contact junctions during a stick period leads to an increasing real contact area , hence strengthening the contact .",
    "the mechanism for the velocity - dependence of @xmath8 and the mechanism for the age - dependence of @xmath9 are not un - related ; both can be understood using the concept of a memory length @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to show , by explicit numerical simulation , that the model based on the phenomenological description of ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to explain qualitatively ( and sometimes even quantitatively ) many interesting features found in experiments .",
    "the model incorporates the existing understanding of the age - dependence of the static friction and the velocity - dependence of the dynamic friction at low velocity , but does not make a distinction between the dynamic and static frictions .",
    "there is no abrupt change from `` static '' friction to `` dynamic '' friction as in the traditional description of friction ; this is important for numerical simulation used to construct the entire phase diagram for the dynamics of dry friction .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review the phenomenology of dry friction , focusing on the recent experiments by t. baumberger et al .",
    "we then show that the phenomenological description of ref .",
    "@xcite is equivalent to the well - known rice - ruina friction law on rock friction in the case of small deviation from the constant velocity motion @xcite .",
    "the results from simulation of the model will be presented in the last section together with some concluding remarks .",
    "following the pioneering work of rabinowicz on metals @xcite , many experimental studies have been performed to study the low velocity friction properties of various materials .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the paper to review these experimental work on the dynamics of dry friction .",
    "instead , we focus on a recent extensive experimental study of the dry friction dynamics of a paper - on - paper block - spring system ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) by t. baumberger et al .",
    "their experiments verified many known properties of dry friction and gave a rather complete picture of dry friction in various regimes .",
    "in particular , they explored systematically the dynamical phase diagram by varying the driving velocity @xmath6 , the slider mass @xmath10 and the spring stiffness @xmath11 .",
    "the features of their experiments are summarized as follows .",
    "* the phase diagram in control parameter space @xmath12 consists of two regions that can be characterized by stick - slip and steady sliding respectively and they are separated by a bifurcation curve .",
    "the character of the bifurcation changes from a direct ( supercritical ) hopf type in the creep - dominated regime to an inverted ( subcritical ) one in the inertial regime as @xmath6 increases .",
    "* in the steady sliding region , the measured dynamic friction coefficient @xmath2 exhibits velocity weakening in low - velocity range ( @xmath13 ) which can be fitted as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an arbitrary velocity scale ; and velocity strengthening at larger velocities which can be characterized as @xmath16 * the static friction coefficient @xmath1 was found to increase with the contact age @xmath17 as @xmath18 * by introducing a characteristic memory length @xmath19 , a relation between eq .  [ mu_dv ] and eq .  [ mu_st ] ,",
    "i.e. @xmath20 can be established .",
    "here @xmath19 , which is given experimentally as @xmath21 @xcite , can be interpreted as an average sliding displacement needed to move to new micro - contacts .",
    "these results are rather general ( rock - rock friction , for example , exhibits similar features ) .",
    "the experiments show that the motion of the system at low - velocity ( @xmath13 ) is primarily controlled by a creep process .",
    "based on these results , a phenomenological model of dry friction dynamics at low - velocity regime @xcite of the paper - on - paper system has been proposed . both linear @xcite and nonlinear @xcite stability analysis of the model near the bifurcation give excellent quantitative agreements with experiments . beside this , the transient behavior in the steady sliding region of the system after setting the driving velocity to zero suddenly has been studied under the aid of the model @xcite , where two - stage process has been observed . however , there is no systematic theoretical study of the entire regime covering the crossover from the `` static '' friction regime to the `` dynamic '' friction regime and the crossover to the high - velocity ( inertial ) regime . in this paper",
    "we show numerically that most important experimental features in various regimes can be reproduced in a single model .",
    "we follow the phenomenological approach used in ref . @xcite . consider the experimental setup shown in fig .  1 . the motion of the block under the influence of the external driving force as shown in fig .  1 , is assumed to be a thermally activated creeping motion in a periodic pinning potential biased by the external driving force . in the low bias regime , where the barrier heights of the effective potential are comparable with the thermal activation energy , the velocity of the slider is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is",
    "the typical distance between two potential minima , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the thermal time for escaping from a given well into its downstream ( upstream ) nearest neighbor .",

    "@xmath29 can be written as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number moles of the degrees of freedom involved in the creep motion .",
    "@xmath32 is the oscillation frequency about the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "the amplitude @xmath33 of the periodic pinning potential is assumed to increase with the dynamical contact age variable @xmath34 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , hence the barrier heights are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the external force ( in the experimental setup , it is the spring force induced by the driving velocity @xmath6 ) .",
    "although eqs .",
    "[ dot_x ] and [ tau_inverse ] are valid strictly only for a time- and position - independent external force and a time - independent pinning potential , they can also be used in more general cases under the assumption that the changes in @xmath36 and @xmath37 are so slow that an _ adiabatic _",
    "approximation is valid . combining the above equations we can write the velocity of the slider as @xmath38 in the case that @xmath39 , the above equation can be approximated as @xmath40 we now proceed to derive @xmath41 by considering the case of constant velocity motion ( @xmath42 ) . in this case @xmath43 , and the friction force ( given in eq .",

    "we now show that this description of friction is in fact equivalent to the state- and rate - dependent friction law proposed by rice and ruina @xcite in the case of small deviation from constant velocity motion . to make this connection",

    "for example , it will be useful for studying rock friction , which is important in the study of earthquake dynamics .    for the case where @xmath29 is comparable with @xmath62 ( this can be thought of as in the _",

    "all the coefficients in the friction law are determined experimentally for the paper - on - paper system except for the value of @xmath78 , which is determined as follows .",
    "we consider the deflection point at @xmath79 from velocity weakening to velocity strengthening ; this is determined using @xmath80 .",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the amplitude and period decrease as the stiffness @xmath11 is increased .",
    "the amplitude approaches zero continuously as @xmath11 becomes larger and larger ; this suggests that the bifurcation from stick - slip to steady sliding by increasing @xmath11 is a direct hopf bifurcation .",
    "this agrees with previous theoretical and numerical analysis @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the transition from stick - slip with a finite amplitude to steady sliding ( with zero amplitude ) when increasing the pulling velocity @xmath6 is rather sharp ( the transition velocity is around @xmath103 ) .",
    "this supports that the bifurcation encountered by increasing velocity is of the inverted hopf type as was suggested previously @xcite based on experimental data ( but was not understood theoretically ) .",
    "we have shown numerically that the inverted hopf bifurcation can be obtained within our fricition model .",
