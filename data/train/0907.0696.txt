    "penrose diagrams are commonly used to describe the global structure of spacetimes .",
    "the mathematically rigorous construction of these diagrams , first given by penrose  @xcite , involves a careful look at the asymptotic behavior of spacetime , as is well summarized in  @xcite .",
    "such conformal diagrams are well adapted for showing the global structure of spacetimes containing null shells , and many examples of such penrose diagrams can be seen in  @xcite .",
    "dray and t  hooft presented similar diagrams in  @xcite , which described how spherically symmetric shells of massless matter affect schwarzschild spacetime .    although penrose diagrams have been proposed for more involved spacetime structures , such as the collapse of stars and the evaporation of black holes  @xcite , these are often presented without rigorous mathematical construction . here",
    "we will extend the work of dray and t  hooft by carefully drawing penrose diagrams in one global set of coordinates .",
    "this will allow us a visual means of investigating the structure of these schwarzschild spacetimes joined by shells , as is particularly well demonstrated by our investigations of shells with negative energy density and of successive shells .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ dth ]",
    "we present the penrose diagrams given in  @xcite , which we then redraw more accurately in section  [ shifted ] . in section",
    "[ negative ] , we consider the effect of shells with negative energy density , showing that such shells can be used to construct traversable wormholes . in section",
    "[ successive ] , we consider the effect of successive , non - intersecting shells , paying particular attention to the case of concentric shells of equal but opposite total energy . finally , in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss our results .",
    ".,width=288 ]    dray and t  hooft  @xcite  constructed solutions of the einstein field equation which represent two separate schwarzschild spacetimes joined along spherically symmetric shells of massless matter .",
    "these shells are described by stress - energy tensors of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a null kruskal - szekeres coordinate , @xmath2 corresponds to the horizon , and the shell is located at @xmath3 .",
    "one of the more interesting features of spacetimes joined in such a manner , first shown explicitly in  @xcite and drawn in figure  [ shiftedhorizon ] , is that there is a shift in the horizon as an observer crosses over the shell .",
    "this result is easily explained in the case where the shell separates two schwarzschild regions with different masses , since @xmath4 and @xmath5 will meet the shell , on their respective sides , at different points .",
    "surprisingly this shift also occurs in the case where both regions are of equal mass and the shell is at the horizon .",
    "a careful look at the penrose diagram in figure  [ shiftedhorizon ] shows that it is impossible to draw both the shifted and unshifted horizons as null lines while preserving the boundary .",
    "the horizons are null lines , and should therefore be kept at @xmath6  as we cross the boundary . the center picture in figure  [ draythooft3 ]",
    "is therefore drawn incorrectly .",
    "the off - horizon , unequal - mass penrose diagrams are correct , if we assume each region is drawn in its own set of coordinates , however , they are misleading as drawn",
    ". we will show below that drawing the entire diagram with one set of coordinates changes the shape of the singularity , which is the only line not drawn along a null trajectory . by drawing the pictures , and especially the boundary , more accurately",
    ", it is possible to obtain physical information directly from the diagrams , such as the relative shift in horizons and the relative positions of horizons .",
    "we begin by reviewing the construction of the spacetimes in  @xcite . in order to glean as much physical understanding from these penrose diagrams as possible",
    ", we shall be pedantic about the use of one coordinate system to draw the entire spacetime . throughout this paper",
    ", @xmath7 and @xmath8 will refer to the coordinates of the region where @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 will refer to the coordinates of the region where @xmath12 .",
    "we first assume that the coordinates in region  2 can be expressed as functions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , by requiring the metric to be continuous at the join we get two relations , @xmath15 @xmath16 which can be used to find @xmath10 and @xmath11 as functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that   in principle yields a global relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath17 , whereas   refers to a boundary condition that applies only at the shell .      in the case of a shell at the horizon , and",
    "can be simplified extensively , resulting in the expressions @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the constant from the @xmath20 component of the stress energy tensor in  .",
    "we have also assumed the relationship in   is a global relationship , and linear in @xmath13 .",
    "penrose diagrams are traditionally drawn using the canonical asymptotic transformation @xmath21 by making the substitutions from before doing the asymptotic coordinate transformation on the spacetime , so that @xmath22 we obtain a penrose diagram that differs from the standard `` straight '' schwarzschild conformal diagram .     and @xmath17 as in equations  .",
    "the bold lines are the singularities drawn in the shifted coordinates .",
    "the second figure represents the dray-t  hooft spacetime with the shell represented by the double line at the horizon.,width=288 ]     and @xmath17 as in equations  .",
    "the bold lines are the singularities drawn in the shifted coordinates .",
    "the second figure represents the dray-t  hooft spacetime with the shell represented by the double line at the horizon.,width=288 ]    the first diagram in figure  [ shift ] shows the shifted coordinate system drawn on top of the straight penrose diagram for schwarzschild spacetime ; both superimposed diagrams represent a schwarzschild spacetime of the same mass .",
    "the most striking change in the diagram is in the shape of the singularities , which are no longer perfectly horizontal . in the second diagram in figure  [ shift ] , we have split the spacetime along the location of the shell , at the horizon , and joined it to a region with unshifted coordinates .",
    "this accurately depicts the entire dray-t  hooft spacetime , drawn in the coordinates of the unshifted region .",
    "the set of coordinates the diagrams are drawn in is of course arbitrary ; we could just as easily have drawn these pictures using the @xmath23 and @xmath17 coordinates .",
    "this would have the effect of curving the white hole singularity instead of the black hole singularity , but the relative shift in the horizon would be the same .",
    "the case of a shell that is not at the horizon is more complicated than the equal mass ( at the horizon ) case .",
    "going back to the general relations   and   and solving for the region  2 coordinates as functions of the region  1 coordinates , we get @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the lambert w function ( also known as the product log ) .",
    "the integration constant , found by setting @xmath27 at the singularity , is identically zero .",
    "there is a freedom in the choice of @xmath28 , and we have chosen a simple linear relationship that satisfies  .",
    "also ,   again implicitly assumes that the relation in   is true for all values of @xmath7 .",
    "these functions are then used to draw the penrose diagram in region  2 .",
    "the singularity in region  2 , where @xmath29 , is computed as the nested function @xmath30 .",
    "the shifted horizon is drawn as a null line starting at @xmath5 on the shell .",
    "figure  [ unequalmass ] shows the shifted diagrams for shells with positive energy density that are collapsing or expanding , respectively .    , and @xmath31 .",
    "on the right is a diagram for the case where @xmath32 , and @xmath33,width=288 ]    , and @xmath31 . on the right",
    "is a diagram for the case where @xmath32 , and @xmath33,width=288 ]    the second diagram in figure  [ unequalmass ] , with @xmath34 , results in a shifted white hole singularity .",
    "this singularity , however , does not lie within the light cone of the shell , and can not therefore be described by the metric continuity equations ,   and  , that we have previously used to construct the shifted coordinates . in figure  [ unequalmass ] , we have chosen a linear relationship for @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , the lambert w function becomes complex at @xmath36 , mathematically dictating that the original coordinate relationship   is no longer useful .",
    "the choice of coordinate extension used is completely arbitrary , so long as modest continuity conditions hold .",
    "we can nonetheless use the relationships in   to fully describe this case if we instead treat the @xmath13 and @xmath14 coordinates as functions of @xmath23 and @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ negalpha ] shows a penrose diagram for a shell with @xmath34 , with the region  1 singularity drawn in @xmath23 and @xmath17 coordinates .",
    "similar comments apply to the case @xmath37 , with the roles of the regions reversed .",
    "these diagrams reveal some important characteristics of these spacetimes .",
    "as shown in figure  [ unequalmass ] , when a shell passes over an observer , their relative position with respect to the horizon transverse to the shell is changed . in the positive @xmath38 case ( the first diagram in figure  [ unequalmass ] )",
    ", an observer in the ( left ) asymptotic region may even be shifted into the black hole .",
    "diagram drawn in @xmath23 , @xmath17 coordinates : * here we have drawn the entire diagram in the region  2 coordinates . by using these coordinates , there is no need to use an arbitrary function.,width=288 ]    for completeness , we apply similar techniques to the next case considered in  @xcite  and look at the penrose diagrams when @xmath39 or @xmath40 . here",
    "we use a shell with a trajectory along the null kruskal - szekeres @xmath1-direction , in order to retain the standard orientation of the penrose diagram for minkowski space .",
    "again we see that the singularities are no longer straight , as shown in figure  [ flat ] .    in constructing figure  [ flat ] ,",
    "we have again used a linear function to describe the relationship between the coordinates transverse to the shell , which are now @xmath8 and @xmath11 . in the second diagram ,",
    "the simplest linear relationship that satisfies is @xmath41 note that the second diagram in figure  [ flat ] is not changed when the mass of region 1 is changed .",
    "schwarzschild mass diagrams : * on the left is the diagram for a spacetime with a shell at @xmath42 . on the right is a diagram for the case where @xmath43.,width=192 ]    schwarzschild mass diagrams : * on the left is the diagram for a spacetime with a shell at @xmath42 . on the right",
    "is a diagram for the case where @xmath43.,width=192 ]",
    "until this point , we have been careful to consider only spacetimes containing shells with positive energy density .",
    "using our techniques , however , it is elementary to study the effects of shells with negative energy density .",
    "looking explicitly at the energy density component of the stress - energy tensor , transformed to the canonical schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath44 we see that the sign of the energy density depends on both the sign of the change in mass between the two regions and on the sign of @xmath38 .",
    "this differs from the similar expression given in  @xcite , where the dependence on @xmath38 has been omitted , since negative energy density shells were not being considered .",
    "the dependence on @xmath38 arises because the sign of @xmath38 dictates whether the shell is expanding or contracting .",
    "note that we have not concerned ourselves with the `` how '' of negative energy density , but only its effects . for detailed discussions of negative energy in general relativity ,",
    "see ford and roman  @xcite .    , and @xmath33 .",
    "the second diagram depicts the case where @xmath32 , and @xmath31 .",
    "note the shift has opened a gap between the two @xmath13 and @xmath23 horizons , that a time - like or light - like trajectory can pass through.,width=288 ]    , and @xmath33 .",
    "the second diagram depicts the case where @xmath32 , and @xmath31 .",
    "note the shift has opened a gap between the two @xmath13 and @xmath23 horizons , that a time - like or light - like trajectory can pass through.,width=288 ]    when we draw diagrams with negative energy density shells , there are some important changes in the structure of the spacetime that are easily seen by looking at our penrose diagrams . in figure",
    "[ negunequal ] , we see that the horizons , in both cases , have shifted in the positive @xmath45 direction .",
    "this shift in the horizon allows a null geodesic to pass through the einstein - rosen bridge to the other asymptotically flat region of the spacetime .",
    "these figures show this important attribute of the spacetime with little computational effort .",
    "wormholes in spherically symmetric spacetimes have been discussed at length by morris and thorne  @xcite and visser  @xcite .",
    "each of these authors demonstrates that the resulting spacetime must have a stress - energy tensor that compromises either the weak energy condition or the averaged weak energy condition .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that our simple wormholes require negative energy density for their construction .",
    "our techniques can be easily generalized to draw penrose diagrams of spacetimes with multiple schwarzschild regions joined along successive shells . through most of this paper , and in particular in figures  [ unequalmass ] and  [ negunequal ] , we have used the @xmath13 , @xmath14 coordinates to draw the joined penrose diagrams . in figure  [ negalpha ]",
    "we drew penrose diagrams using the @xmath23 , @xmath17 coordinates .",
    "it is straightforward to combine two such diagrams , resulting in a spacetime that contains two successive shells , drawn using the coordinates from the middle region .",
    "these spacetimes satisfy the boundary conditions in  @xcite  at each shell , but the diagrams can be obtained by combining the appropriate `` jigsaw puzzle pieces '' from figures  [ unequalmass ] and  [ negalpha ] .",
    "for example , in figure  [ 2shellsu2v2 ] we have drawn two diagrams , each with two shells .",
    "the first diagram shows a spacetime with three schwarzschild regions , joined by two shells with positive energy density , while the second diagram represents three schwarzschild regions joined by two shells of negative energy density .",
    "the same penrose diagrams can also be drawn using the region  1 coordinates . in this case region  3",
    "is drawn by first relating the coordinates in region  3 to those in region  2 using   and  , and then inserting the known functional dependence of the region  2 coordinates on the region  1 coordinates , obtaining expressions of the form @xmath46 and @xmath47 . while difficult to evaluate by hand , _ mathematica _ has no difficulty working with these composite functions , leading to diagrams such as those shown in figure  [ 2shellsu1v1 ] , drawn entirely using the region  1 coordinates .",
    "it is particularly interesting to consider concentric shells with equal but opposite total energy .",
    "looking at figure  [ equalshells ] , it is obvious that there is a net shift in the horizons , even though the region  1 and region  3 schwarzschild regions have the same mass .",
    "this net shift arises because each shift is dependent on the energy density , not the total energy , as can also be seen from the dependence of the stress - energy tensor on the radius of the shell in  . since the inner shell will always be smaller , and",
    "hence more dense , than the outer shell , there will always be a net shift when the shells have equal but opposite total energy .",
    "and @xmath17 coordinates : * here the first diagram has two shells of positive energy density , while the second diagram has two shells of negative energy density.,width=264 ]     and @xmath17 coordinates : * here the first diagram has two shells of positive energy density , while the second diagram has two shells of negative energy density.,width=264 ]     and @xmath14 coordinates : * the first diagram has two shells of positive energy density , while the second has two shells of negative energy density , width=264 ]     and @xmath14 coordinates : * the first diagram has two shells of positive energy density , while the second has two shells of negative energy density , width=264 ]     and @xmath11 coordinates .",
    "the first two figures represent concentric shells , where the inner shell has positive energy density .",
    "the last two figures are penrose diagrams of concentric shells where the inner shell has negative energy density , and the overall shift allows for travel between the exterior schwarzschild regions.,width=288 ]     and @xmath11 coordinates .",

    "the last two figures are penrose diagrams of concentric shells where the inner shell has negative energy density , and the overall shift allows for travel between the exterior schwarzschild regions.,width=288 ]",
    "the primary purpose of this work has been to outline a method for drawing accurate penrose diagrams for schwarzschild - like spacetimes containing spherical shells of massless matter .",
    "this method is straightforward : solve the boundary conditions given in  @xcite , then construct particular diagrams numerically .",
    "this construction was originally motivated by the observation that the diagrams given in  @xcite  can not in fact be accurate , as discussed in section  [ dth ] .",
    "however , the accurate diagrams constructed in section  [ shifted ] do not in fact contain any new physical insight ; one could argue that the diagrams in  @xcite  are indeed correct , even though some artistic liberty was taken .",
    "the situation is different when negative energy shells are considered .",
    "first of all , as discussed in section  [ negative ] , even a single negative energy shell leads to traversable wormholes ; the shift goes `` the other way '' .",
    "of even greater interest , we showed in section  [ successive ] that nested shells of equal but opposite total energy still lead to traversable wormholes  provided the negative energy shell is inside the positive energy shell .",
    "thus , should `` nested '' positive / negative - energy particle pairs exist , they would generate traversable wormholes !",
    "how big would such a wormhole be ? as a characteristic scale , we determine the `` width '' between the transverse horizons in regions  1 and  3 . as a measure of this width ,",
    "we compute the difference @xmath48 in killing time between the null extensions of those horizons into region  2 , measured along a null line parallel to the shells . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the situation shown in the lower left diagram in  figure  [ equalshells ] . in null kruskal - szekeres coordinates , @xmath49 inserting @xmath50 ( respectively , @xmath51 ) on the transverse horizon in region  1 ( respectively , region  3 ) into  , and then into  , using  , and subtracting , almost everything cancels ( since we are assuming @xmath1 is constant ) , and we are left with @xmath52 thus , the `` width '' of the wormhole depends on the `` distance '' between the shells , as given by the ratio of the @xmath53 , which can be chosen arbitrarily",
    ".    remarkably ,   depends on the background mass @xmath54 only through the schwarzschild mass of region  2 , which satisfies @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the ( magnitude of the ) total energy in each shell .",
    "if we assume that @xmath57 , then @xmath48 scales linearly with  @xmath58 . even if we choose the @xmath53 to be nearly the same , the effect might , in principle , be large enough to measure .",
    "for example , if @xmath59 , @xmath56 is the electron mass , and @xmath58 the mass of the sun , then @xmath60 .",
    "in summary , we have succeeded in constructing `` jigsaw puzzle pieces '' which can be combined to analyze more complex arrangements of shells , such as the successive shells considered in section  [ successive ] .",
    "although new pieces do need to be constructed to analyze scenarios with additional shells , this method is still a useful tool for analyzing the effect of those shells . in future work",
    ", we hope to adapt these methods so as to be able to analyze intersecting shells , as were also considered by  @xcite .",
    "this paper is an extension of the paper submitted by jsh in partial fulfillment of the degree requirements for his m.s .  in physics at oregon state university  @xcite ."
