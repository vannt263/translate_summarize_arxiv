    "<S> this should be compared with the case of plates made of real metal ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and review @xcite for details ) , where different opinions on the validity of the nernst heat theorem were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the mechanisms for the violation of this theorem in some models of metals and dielectrics are quite different . in metals , </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the nernst heat theorem depends on the scattering processes of free charge carriers on phonons , defects ( impurities ) etc . for the drude metals with impurities ( like in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) the residual relaxation at @xmath37 is not equal to zero and the nernst heat theorem is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the same takes place in the case of metals described by the plasma model . for perfect crystal lattices of the drude metals with no impurities , </S>",
    "<S> relaxation at zero temperature is absent and the nernst heat theorem is violated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these cases are discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite devoted to metals . for dielectrics , the validity of the nernst heat theorem does not depend on the scattering processes due to quick vanishing of the concentration of carriers when the temperature vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> here , the violation occurs due to the inclusion of infinitely large dielectric permittivity at zero frequency . </S>",
    "<S> even the sign of the entropy at zero temperature for metals and dielectrics is opposite ( negative for perfect crystal lattices of the drude metals and positive for dielectrics with included dc conductivity ) . for a complete discussion of this subject , containing all mathematical details , </S>",
    "<S> see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq24 ] ) is re - derived in the framework of a more general case of two dissimilar dielectrics .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results are important for many applications of dispersion forces . as an example we refer to the problem of a noncontact atomic friction where the discrepancy between experiment and theory is very large @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it has been proposed that the friction observed in the experiment of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite could be due to the dc conductivity of an underlying sio@xmath59 plate described by @xmath62 . from the preceding discussion </S>",
    "<S> , it can be seen that such a proposition would not be in agreement with the thermodynamic constraint . </S>",
    "<S> further applications of this constraint in the theory of dispersion forces are under way ( see ref </S>",
