    "after our work was submitted , new preprint appeared confirming our findings on stability of topological phase with respect to small single - fermion tunneling as well as time - reversal symmetry breaking for @xmath80 , c. chen , w. yan , c. s. ting , y. chen , arxiv:1602.01369 .            even though @xmath89 criticality was suggested to occur , effective velocity at critical point",
    "was argued to vanish in infrared limit .",
    "the finite - size scaling of the peak value of the fidelity susceptibility is sensitive to the dependence of correlation length on the deviation from criticality and not to the velocity of soft excitations at critical point . hence vanishing effective velocity",
    "is not manifested in fidelity susceptibility studies and for this reason transition that we observe looks like criticality at ordinary quantum ising tranisiton , with correlation length critical exponent equal to unity ."
