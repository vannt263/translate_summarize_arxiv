    "the layout of the na61/shine detector  @xcite is presented in figure  [ fig : detector ] .",
    "it consists of a large acceptance hadron spectrometer with excellent capabilities in charged particle momentum measurements and identification by a set of five time projection chambers as well as time - of - flight detectors .",
    "the high resolution forward calorimeter , the projectile spectator detector , measures energy flow around the beam direction , which in nucleus - nucleus reactions is primarily a measure of the number of spectator ( non - interacted ) nucleons and is thus related to the centrality of the collision .",
    "additionally , detector system consist of three time - of - flight walls used for low momentum particle identification .",
    "an array of beam detectors identifies beam particles , secondary hadrons and ions as well as primary ions , and measures precisely their trajectories .",
    "the na61/shine experiment up to now used secondary hadron beams in the momentum range from 13 gev / c to 350 gev / c , as well as attenuated primary pb@xmath1 ion beams in the momentum range from 13@xmath0 gev / c to 158@xmath0 gev / c . for the start of the strong interactions physics program",
    "secondary @xmath2be ions were produced via fragmentation of the pb@xmath1 ions as primary ions other than pb were not available before 2015 . in 2015 primary @xmath3ar ion beams in the same momentum range were delivered to na61/shine and @xmath4xe beams are expected in 2017 .",
    "in the data taking on @xmath5be+@xmath6be collisions a 2 cm diameter interaction trigger counter s4 was placed on the beam - line between vtpc-1 and vtpc-2 .",
    "this arrangement allowed to measure the total inelastic @xmath5be+@xmath6be cross section @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the na61/shine measurements at 13@xmath0 , 20@xmath0 and 30@xmath0 gev / c are presented in figure  [ fig : inelastic ] .",
    "the na61/shine results are in good agreement with an earlier measurement at lower beam momentum  @xcite and a glauber model calculation using the glissando code  @xcite .",
    "be+@xmath6be cross section as a function of beam momentum .",
    "results are compared with the measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite , world p+p data and glissando model predictions.,width=321 ]      the rapidity spectra of @xmath8 in @xmath5be+@xmath6be collisions at the three beam momenta and four centrality classes together with data for inelastic p+p interactions are presented in figure  [ fig : rapidity ] .",
    "one can observe a small asymmetry in the rapidity distribution for @xmath5be+@xmath6be collisions around mid - rapidity .",
    "this asymmetry may come from two effects :    * the asymmetry between projectile and target nuclei ( @xmath5be projectile on @xmath6be target ) which is expected to enhance particle production in the backward ( target ) hemisphere , * the selection of central collisions which requires a small number of projectile spectators without any explicit requirement imposed on the number of target spectators ; this selection , when used for collisions of identical nuclei , would enhance particle production in the forward hemisphere .    note that the two effects partially compensate leading to a relatively small asymmetry of the measured spectra",
    "rapidity distributions of @xmath8 produced in inelastic p+p and be+be interactions ( 4 centrality classes ) at 20@xmath0 , 30@xmath0 , 40@xmath0 , 75@xmath0 and 150@xmath0 gev / c.,width=396 ]      the excellent particle identification based on the combined time - of - flight ( tof ) and energy loss ( de / dx ) method allow us to calculate @xmath10 ratios .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath11 ratio at mid - rapidity for inelastic p+p interactions and central pb+pb / au+au collisions is presented in figure  [ fig : horn ] .",
    "the na61/shine data suggest that even in inelastic p+p interactions the energy dependence of the @xmath11 ratio exhibits rapid changes in the sps energy range .",
    "a step structure is seen which appears to be a precursor of the horn structure  @xcite observed in central pb+pb collisions .",
    "data obtained at rhic and lhc  @xcite are also plotted in figure  [ fig : horn ] to show the trend beyond the sps energy range .",
    "ratio and inverse slope parameter t of @xmath12 transverse mass spectra at mid - rapidity.,width=472 ]    the inverse slope parameter t was fitted to the transverse mass spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : horn ] presents the energy dependence of t for @xmath13 in inelastic p+p reactions from na61/shine compared to world data for p+p and pb+pb / au+au reactions from refs .",
    "results from inelastic p+p collisions exhibit a step structure like the one observed in central pb+pb interactions .",
    "the @xmath14 rapidity distribution measured by na61/shine is compared to previous measurements in figure  [ fig : lambda ] . in order to partly compensate for differences resulting from different collision energies",
    "the comparison is done in terms of the scaled rapidity @xmath15 and the spectra are normalized to unity .",
    "the mean @xmath14 multiplicity is calculated by summing up the measured rapidity spectrum and extrapolating it to lower and higher rapidities using the parametrization of the world data from figure  [ fig : lambda ] .",
    "the collision energy dependence of the mean @xmath14 multiplicity including the new na61/shine result is plotted in figure  [ fig : lambda ] .     produced in inelastic p+p collisions at 158 gev / c.,width=472 ]      the transverse momentum fluctuations were studied using strongly intensive measure @xmath16 $ ]  @xcite for @xmath5be+@xmath6be interactions at several collision centralities and energies .",
    "the results were compared to those obtained from inelastic p+p interactions by na61/shine and are very similar .",
    "transverse momentum fluctuations in @xmath5be+@xmath6be interactions do not present structures which could be related to the critical point .",
