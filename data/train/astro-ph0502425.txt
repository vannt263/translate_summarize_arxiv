    "one of the most significant of these over scales of most interest for parameter estimation is weak gravitational lensing by large scale structure .",
    "fortunately it can be modelled accurately as a second - order effect : the linear gravitational potential along the line of sight lenses the linear perturbations at the last scattering surface ( see e.g.  refs .",

    "modelling of fully non - linear evolution is not required for the near future on scales of several arcminutes ( corresponding to multipoles @xmath4 ) for the temperature and electric polarization power spectra .",
    "non - linear corrections can easily be applied to the lensing potential if and when required , provided that its non - gaussianity can be ignored  @xcite .    in principle , the weak - lensing contribution to the observed sky can probably be subtracted given sufficiently accurate and clean high - resolution observations .",
    "early work in this area  @xcite suggested a limit on the accuracy of this reconstruction due to the statistical nature of the ( unknown ) unlensed cmb fields .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that polarization removes this limit in models where lensing is the only source of @xmath5-mode polarization on small scales  @xcite .",
    "if subtraction could be done exactly we could recover the unlensed gaussian sky , and use this for all further analysis . however current methods for subtracting the lensing contribution are approximate , and not easy to apply to realistic survey geometries .",
    "the result of imperfect lensing subtraction is a sky with complicated , non - gaussian statistics of the signal , and significantly more complicated noise properties than the original ( lensed ) observations . for observations in the near future ,",
    "a much simpler method to account for the lensing effect is to work with the lensed sky itself , modelling the lensing effect by the expected change in the power spectra and their covariances .",
    "the effects of lensing non - gaussianities on the covariance of the temperature and @xmath6-mode polarization power spectra are likely to be small , but this will not be the case for the @xmath5-mode spectrum once thermal - noise levels permit imaging of the lens - induced @xmath5 modes  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss how to compute the lensed power spectra accurately .",
    "the simulation of lensed skies and the effect on parameter estimation is discussed in ref .",

    "where the non - gaussianity of the lensing potential can be ignored , the calculation of the lensed power spectra is straightforward in principle .",
    "however , achieving good accuracy on both large and small scales for all the cmb observables is surprisingly difficult .",
    "the lensing action on the cmb fields at scales approaching the r.m.s .  of the lensing deflection angle ( @xmath7 ) can not be accurately described with a first - order taylor expansion , as in the full - sky harmonic method of ref .",
    "there is not much power in the unlensed cmb on such scales , but a first - order taylor expansion still gives lensed power spectra that are inaccurate at the percent level for @xmath8 .",
    "the lensed cmb on scales well below the diffusion scale is generated by the action of small - scale weak lenses on the ( relatively ) large - scale unlensed cmb , and a taylor expansion should become more accurate again  @xcite .",
    "( however , non - linear effects are also important on such scales . ) the breakdown of the taylor expansion can be easily fixed by using the flat - sky correlation - function methods of refs .",

    "however , a new problem then arises on scales where the flat - sky approximation is not valid . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is not confined to large scales due to the mode - coupling nature of lensing : degree - scale lenses contribute significantly to the lensed power over a wide range of observed scales . in this paper",
    "we develop a new method for computing the lensed power spectra that is accurate on all scales where non - gaussianity due to non - linear effects is not important .",
    "we do this by calculating the lensed correlation functions on the spherical sky .",

    "@xcite and the perturbative harmonic result of ref .",
    "@xcite , and explain why the latter is not accurate enough for precision cosmology .",
    "the effect of non - linear evolution of the density field on the lensed power spectra is considered in section  [ sec : nonlin ] .",
    "we end with conclusions , and include some technical results in the appendices .",

    "furthermore we see that for @xmath194 the method is also somewhat inaccurate on large scales : because the @xmath5-mode signal comes from a wide range of @xmath97 , and the @xmath6-mode power peaks on small scales , the non - perturbative effects can be significant on all scales .",
    "in fact , the large - scale lensed @xmath6-mode power also receives most of its contribution from small - scale modes since the unlensed polarization power spectrum rises steeply with @xmath97 on large scales .",

    "while the accurate flat - sky result is probably sufficient to planck sensitivities , curvature effects must be taken account for truly accurate results approaching the cosmic - variance limit .",
    "although the curvature is negligible on the scale of the deflection angles , it is not negligible on the scale of the lensing potential coherence length . computing our full - sky accurate result is not much harder or slower than computing the flat result , so we recommend our new calculation for future work .",

    "the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect is the main such effect for the temperature anisotropies , and current uncertainties in the reionization history and morphology make the spectrum @xmath220 uncertain at the few percent level at @xmath199  @xcite .",
    "this is a little larger than the error in the first - order harmonic lensing result , but this does nt mean that one should be content with the error in the latter .",
