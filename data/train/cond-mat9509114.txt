    "non - adiabatic systems , where the quantum mechanics of electrons and that of ions are deeply entangled , are among the most fascinating in physics . in condensed matter ,",
    "entire classes of phenomena such as superconductivity or charge - density waves are of this nature .",
    "dynamical jahn - teller ( djt ) centers ( molecules and ions , impurities , nuclei ) constitute perhaps the simplest `` zero - dimensional '' example of nonadiabatic behavior , and have attracted attention for over half a century@xcite .",
    "an amusing anomaly has long been pointed out@xcite in certain simple djt centers , where an @xmath12 electronic doublet is jahn - teller ( jt ) coupled to a vibrational ( `` pseudo - rotational '' ) @xmath13 doublet . in modern language , this anomaly can be seen as a berry phase @xcite . in simple words ,",
    "what happens in these systems is that there exists a class of closed paths ( loops ) in the @xmath13 coordinate space , regarded as classical , adiabatically transporting the electronic ground state from an initial value @xmath14 to a final value @xmath15 , instead of into @xmath14 itself .",
    "there is a berry phase @xmath16 , whose origin lies in the fact that the point of electronic degeneracy ( the `` conical point''@xcite ) is irreducibly surrounded by the trajectory in vibron space .",
    "this anomaly which is present at the adiabatic level , where the ionic coordinated are classical , has very interesting consequences when the full joint ion - electron problem is finally quantized . in the @xmath17 case",
    "cited above , there appears a new conserved `` pseudo - angular momentum '' quantum number , whose values are half - integer@xcite .",
    "consequently , all vibronic levels become twofold degenerate , as appropriate to a rotor coupled to a pseudospin @xmath18@xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question therefore , to inquire whether other nontrivial cases of djt are realized in nature , which also possess a berry phase .",
    "high - symmetry polyatomic molecules are an obvious place to look at .",
    "the fullerene molecule , c@xmath11 , has a very high @xmath19 symmetry , and a nondegenerate ground state . because of high symmetry , however , fullerene ions , both negative and positive have a high orbital degeneracy , and are therefore good candidates .    in our previous work ,",
    "we have studied@xcite the djt problem of negatively - charged fullerene ions , where @xmath20 electrons partly fill the @xmath21 lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the neutral molecule .",
    "this electronic state couples linearly to the fivefold degenerate @xmath22 vibrations . for odd electron number @xmath23 ,",
    "the spectrum of this coupled dynamical @xmath24 system is affected by anomalies which can again be usefully described in terms of a berry phase@xcite .    among notable consequences , we have predicted the dominance of @xmath25-wave attachment for low - energy electrons@xcite , a negative pairing energy for odd @xmath23@xcite , characteristic spectroscopic anomalies@xcite and a mechanism for kinematic electron pairing@xcite    from the mathematical point of view , nevertheless , the djt of c@xmath26 , namely @xmath27 , was not particularly new : the analytical machinery was basically the same as that previously studied by obrien@xcite for the @xmath28 equal coupling case .    in the present paper , we move on to analyze the problem of the jt effect in the _ positively _ charged fullerene ions c@xmath29 , inquiring in particular about the possible relevance of a berry phase in these systems too . as it will turn out ,",
    "the answer is again affirmative ( though with some qualifications ) .",
    "moreover , we shall deal in this case with the less trivial jt problems @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the search for an adiabatic anomaly will now be done afresh .    fullerene cations c@xmath29 are obtained by removing @xmath32 electrons from ( i.e. adding @xmath32 holes to ) the fivefold degenerate @xmath8 highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo)@xcite .",
    "our approach allows us to treat the one - hole case ( @xmath33 ) as well as the two - holes ( @xmath34 ) singlet case , in a way which is essentially analytical , albeit for a very idealized set of parameters .",
    "a hole in the homo interacts with the c@xmath11 vibrational modes .",
    "we focus on modes which couple linearly with the hole density fluctuations ( which in turn are of course quadratic in the hole wave function ) .",
    "hence , the icosahedral symmetry of the molecule restricts the linearly coupled modes to those of the same symmetry as the irreducible representation of the group ( @xmath19 ) contained in the symmetric product of a hole representation with itself@xcite : @xmath35    the @xmath19 group is a subgroup of the full rotation group o(3 ) .",
    "therefore , a general representation of o(3 ) decomposes into a finite number of representations of @xmath19@xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath4 @xmath36 representations correspond to @xmath37 in icosahedral symmetry , and @xmath5 @xmath38 decomposes into @xmath39 . equation ( [ couplingstructure ] ) may be rewritten , in o(3 ) notation , @xmath40 in order to take advantage of spherical symmetry , and as a simplifying approximation at this initial stage , we neglect the icosahedral details of the molecular shape , and we study the hole - vibron coupling within the o(3 ) scheme , as though c@xmath11 was a perfect sphere@xcite .",
    "we study here therefore the problem of @xmath41 holes coupled to @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 vibrations .",
    "the coupling with a @xmath42 vibration is a trivial polaronic problem , solved exactly as a displaced oscillator , and is irrelevant here , since it shifts energies , but does not cause splittings .",
    "we concentrate on quadrupolar ( @xmath43 ) and hexadecapolar ( @xmath44 ) modes , which lead instead to a non - trivial jt effect . in order to simplify the notation",
    ", we shall switch from the o(3 ) to the so(3 ) notation , omitting therefore the @xmath45 signs for the inversion .",
    "the hamiltonian we consider has the following structure : @xmath46 where @xmath47 describes a free ( uncoupled ) @xmath48 hole and @xmath49 , @xmath50 vibrations , and @xmath51 the hole - vibron interaction , namely @xmath52          c_{m_2,\\sigma}^{\\dagger } c_{m_1+m_2,\\sigma } ~ . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath53 are the energies of the ( harmonic ) vibrations @xmath54 , @xmath55 are dimensionless coupling parameters , @xmath56 are clebsch - gordan coefficients , and there is no loss of generality in choosing the energy zero so that @xmath57 . for simplicity , we shall assume here a single @xmath4 and a single @xmath5 mode corresponding to @xmath58 and @xmath59 vibrons respectively . in real c@xmath11 ,",
    "the spectrum is more complex ( see tab .  [",
    "experener : table ] ) , involving 8 @xmath22 and 6 @xmath9 modes . of these , only two @xmath22 modes , namely @xmath60 and @xmath61 are actually derived from a @xmath48 spherical vibration , while only two doublets , namely @xmath62 and @xmath63 are of @xmath5 origin@xcite .",
    "the other modes derived from different angular momenta ( @xmath64 ) do not belong to a complete @xmath65-multiplet , and can not be simply treated in spherical symmetry .",
    "our work is therefore incomplete and of purely qualitative value .",
    "nevertheless , we expect some of the features of the present simplified analysis to be of more general relevance .",
    "for example , close pairs of modes , such as @xmath66 , or @xmath67 , have no reason to behave qualitatively differently from our @xmath50 mode , in spite of their different @xmath68 and @xmath69 origins .",
    "we will also find a `` conservation of berry phases '' : if a jt - coupled problem has a berry phase , the extension of the vibron space with the addition of a mode that does not carry a berry phase , leaves intact the original berry phase . in our case , we will show that the berry phase is coming exclusively from the @xmath70 coupling , the addition of the @xmath22 modes changing the dynamical properties , but not the topological ones .    according to the different relative values of the four parameters ( @xmath71 ) in @xmath72 ,",
    "different regimes can be attained . in particular , when the coupling is extremely strong ( @xmath73 ) , the jt distortion is large , higher order terms ( neglected in ( [ hesplicita ] ) ) will in principle become relevant .",
    "in such a case , the final state tends to approach closely a static jt symmetry - broken distortion .",
    "when the coupling is instead large but finite , there is a semiclassical region , where quantum fluctuations are able to connect classical equivalent valleys _ via _ tunneling , and so restore the full symmetry while also generating characteristic low - energy tunneling excitations in the spectrum .",
    "the intermediate coupling region @xmath74 is , as usual , the less predictable .",
    "however , the weak coupling limit ( @xmath75 ) finally simplifies again into a perturbative problem .",
    "if either @xmath76 or @xmath77 alternatively vanish , we will have the special cases of @xmath78 or @xmath79 jt respectively .",
    "a special case we shall consider in greatest detail below is that of equal coupling of degenerate oscillators @xmath80 , @xmath6 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the weak - coupling region @xmath81 is discussed in sect .",
    "[ perth : sect ] , obtaining approximate analytic expressions for the splittings and shifts in the spectrum .",
    "next , we shall move to the opposite , strong - coupling case . here",
    ", the classical jt minima of the born - oppenheimer potential energy surfaces are studied first ( sect.[topology : sect ] ) ; then , in sect .",
    "[ semiclass : sect ] , the ionic kinetic energy is introduced semiclassically to obtain a description of the low - energy quantum excitations in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "exact numerical diagonalizations will be used to shed light on a few particular features of the intermediate - coupling regime . finally , the relevance of these preliminary theoretical results to the physics of fullerene cations is discussed in sect .",
    "[ discussion : sect ] .",
    "the weak - coupling limit in a jt problem is a coupled situation in which both the electronic and the vibronic degrees of freedom need to be treated on equal footing , as equally `` fast '' .",
    "their cooperative dynamics is strictly regulated by quantum mechanics , and no `` classical degree of freedom '' can be singled out in this limit , as opposed to the berry - phase semiclassical approach .",
    "nonetheless , the limit of small @xmath82 is easily treated by perturbation theory , and the results are useful in providing an exact match to the semiclassical spectrum on the opposite side of the range of coupling .",
    "the jt coupling ( [ hesplicita ] ) splits and shifts the harmonic levels to second - order in @xmath55 . we compute here these shifts for both the fivefold - degenerate ground state and the 70-fold degenerate one - vibron excitation in the 1-hole case and for equal frequencies @xmath83 .",
    "as we have two small parameters , @xmath77 and @xmath76 , and two different perturbing hamiltonians , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , there is an infinite number of choices of the small perturbing parameter , depending for example on the ratio @xmath86 .",
    "we compute the energy shifts for three special cases : @xmath87 , i.e. perturbing with respect to @xmath84 , @xmath88 , using @xmath85 alone , and finally @xmath89 , the equal coupling case .",
    "the coefficients for the three cases are collected in tab .",
    "[ perturbcoef : table ] , along with the appropriate so(3 ) symmetry labels .",
    "the energy of a state ( in units of @xmath90 ) is thus given by @xmath91 where the number of vibrons is one for all the states except for the ground state at the first line .",
    "we note on the second column five states , in the 1-vibron multiplet , whose shifts are @xmath92 , i.e. the same as for the ground state .",
    "these states are readily identified as the 45-fold degenerate state corresponding to the @xmath50 vibron fundamental state ( here uncoupled , since @xmath87 ) .",
    "parallel considerations apply to the uncoupled @xmath48 vibron in the third column , recognizable by the shifts of @xmath93 .",
    "the equal - coupling case is interesting from the point of view of symmetry .",
    "pooler studied the hamiltonian ( [ hesplicita ] ) from an algebraic point of view@xcite , discovering that the equal frequencies ",
    "equal coupling case @xmath80 , @xmath6 , is actually characterized not only by the obvious so(3 ) symmetry , but also by rotation symmetry in a 5-dimensional space ( so(5 ) group ) . in the language of the so(5 ) irreducible representations , characterized by two quantum numbers [ @xmath94,@xmath95@xcite , the @xmath48 hole is classified as a [ 1,0 ] irreducible representation of so(5 ) , while the 14-fold degenerate vibration ( @xmath96 ) is a realization of the [ 2,0 ] representation of so(5)@xcite . in the fourth column of table  [ perturbcoef :",
    "table ] , we note that the one - vibron level in the equal - coupling case splits into three levels with degeneracies 30 , 35 and 5 respectively .",
    "the levels of degeneracy 5 and 30 are readily seen as representations [ 1,0 ] and [ 3,0 ] of so(5)@xcite .",
    "the 35-fold degenerate level , by table 10 - 3 of reference@xcite is identified with a [ 1,2 ] representation , as indicated in the last column of table  [ perturbcoef : table ] .",
    "as this large symmetry is an exact feature of the hamiltonian , it is not limited to the perturbative regime , but will be carried along to all values of ( equal- ) coupling , and to the semiclassical limit ( sect.[semiclass : sect ] ) in particular .    to conclude , we note that , while the @xmath97 levels are exactly the same in the three perturbative regimes summarized in tab.[perturbcoef : table ] , the @xmath98 levels ( marked in tab.[perturbcoef : table ] with symbols @xmath99 ) , in the three cases , are instead different linear combinations of the same states : this fact has a very simple explanation .",
    "the @xmath100 levels uniquely come from the coupling of the @xmath48 hole to the @xmath48 vibron , and the @xmath101 levels derive from the coupling of the @xmath48 hole to the @xmath50 vibron .",
    "the @xmath98 levels can come from either of the previous couplings , and there is no _ a priori _ reason why they should not mix among themselves .",
    "in this section we want to understand if the jt hole - vibron coupling in c@xmath11 positive ions possesses a berry phase or not . in order to do that",
    ", the canonical steps are the following : ( i ) find the manifold , in the space of classical ionic coordinates , formed by the set of equivalent minima of hamiltonian ( [ hesplicita ] ) ( the minima of the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) energy surface ) ; ( ii ) study the adiabatic transport of the electronic ground state wave - function  in this case a unit vector spanning a five - dimensional sphere  while the ionic coordinates are taken along a closed path on their manifold .",
    "representation ( [ hesplicita ] ) of hamiltonian ( [ hschematica ] ) is inconvenient for this purpose , and we first perform a transformation of the electronic and vibronic operators to a suitable representation .",
    "we start defining a vector of hole - destruction operators , @xmath102 in terms of this vector , the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath103 where @xmath104 indicates the adjoint transpose of ( [ vectc ] ) , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are @xmath107 matrices whose elements are combinations of vibrational coordinates .",
    "next , we apply the following transformation to the electronic operators @xmath108 the transformed vector @xmath109 contains the phase factors necessary to give a suitable symmetry to the transformed @xmath110-matrices .    the final step converts the vibron operators into their real coordinate representation : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and the masses of both oscillators are taken as unity",
    ".    we rewrite @xmath47 and @xmath51 after the final transformation as @xmath113 where the matrices @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the transformed of @xmath105 and @xmath106 under ( [ c_transf ] ) , expressed in terms of @xmath116 ( [ b_transf ] ) read @xmath117 and @xmath118      the classical ( purely static ) solution of the jt problem consists in finding the minimum of the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potential energy defined as the sum of the potential term in ( [ h0 ] ) plus the lowest eigenvalue of the hole - vibron interaction matrix @xmath119 in the ( 5 + 9)-dimensional space of the classical @xmath116 coordinates .",
    "this classical minimum is generally not unique .",
    "more typically , there will be continuous sets of minima , forming well defined manifolds embedded in the multi - dimensional coordinates space@xcite .",
    "we call one such set of minima of the adiabatic potential jahn - teller manifold ( jtm ) . the topology of this manifold crucially affects the possible presence of a berry phase .",
    "we study the jtm following the approach of pik and pryce@xcite , more recently reformulated by ceulemans in a clear and useful form@xcite .",
    "consider a generic one - fermion state @xmath120 where without loss of generality , the @xmath121 can be taken real , with the normalization constraint @xmath122 the quantum amplitudes @xmath123 live therefore on a @xmath124 sphere in 5-dimensions , which we indicate as the electronic sphere ( es ) .    within this notation , it is convenient to rewrite the classical potential energy as @xmath125 at fixed distortion @xmath126 _ and _ electron state @xmath127 .",
    "minimization of @xmath128 with respect to @xmath123 yields , by definition , the ( adiabatic ) bo potential .",
    "if we keep @xmath123 fixed instead , and minimize ( [ veta ] ) with respect to @xmath129 , then we get the extremal points of the bo potential in configuration space as @xmath130    inserting ( [ q_of_min ] ) in ( [ veta ] ) , we obtain a function @xmath131 of the electronic coordinates alone , hence a function defined on the es , not on the space of distortion like the bo potential .",
    "we still have to ensure that the electronic vector is an eigenvector of the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "ceulemans@xcite realized that this condition is equivalent to a second minimization procedure , on the es ; moreover , he recognized that the @xmath131 function is isoextremal to the bo surface , that is , its extremal points on the es correspond ( in a 2:1 way ) to extremal points of the bo surface .",
    "then the jtm has the same symmetry properties of the set of minima of @xmath131 .",
    "we apply this procedure of reverse - order minimization to the present system .",
    "we list here the distortions @xmath132 and @xmath133 which minimize @xmath128 at fixed @xmath134 on the es :    @xmath135    @xmath136    we can choose a ( hyper - polar ) representation for the electronic coordinates such that the unitarity condition ( [ normalization ] ) is automatically satisfied @xmath137 here , @xmath138 i=1,2,3 are the azimuthal angles and @xmath139 the anomaly . substituting ( [ etas ] ) in ( [ q2 ] ) and ( [ q4 ] ) , and then back into ( [ veta ] ) we obtain an expression for the minimum @xmath140 of @xmath131 : @xmath141 and for the jtm coordinates @xmath142      as eq .",

    "constant on the whole _",
    "this is a nontrivial consequence of the large amount of geometrical freedom which is allowed to the molecule by the large degeneracy of the vibron modes : on the contrary , when the dimension of @xmath144-space is less than that of the es ( like for example in the @xmath145 jt system  relevant for the coupling of @xmath8 with the @xmath146 mode , which has no @xmath22 partner ) , @xmath140 is not flat , but is characterized by some amount of corrugation .",
    "the isoextremality property of the @xmath147 implies that the jtm , must have locally the same structure as the es , here @xmath148 , a sphere in five dimensions .",
    "however , upon closer scrutiny , we note a topological difference between the es and the jtm , due to the 2:1 correspondence mentioned above .",
    "in particular , the es is a projective space , as opposite points on the sphere correspond to the same point in the @xmath149-coordinates space ( they belong to the same `` ray '' ) .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that normalized eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix are defined up to a sign .",
    "the jtm does not share this property , since there are no pairs of points on the jtm that generate the same @xmath150 .",
    "here is the source of the berry phase : to each path in the jtm there corresponds a path on the es , but the two are topologically different .",
    "in particular , a loop in the jtm may correspond either to a closed path , or to a path from a point to its opposite ( antipode ) on the es .",
    "in general , the latter path can not be reduced to a point , and there will be a topological effect ( berry phase ) .",

    "it is interesting to consider what happens to the berry phase when the added mode , on its own , carries no berry phase .",
    "the enlargement of the @xmath168-space introduces a large freedom for creating new loops in @xmath168 .",
    "one might in principle think that some of these loops could manage to avoid the conical intersections of bo levels , thus healing the connectivity properties of the jtm , and short - circuiting out the berry phase .",

    "it is well known that @xmath170 problem retains the same topological properties , including the berry phase of @xmath7 , of the @xmath173 system , the effect of the @xmath13 mode consisting essentially only in flattening the jtm , and removing inter - minima barriers .",
    "the reason why new loops seem to be ineffective in destroying the berry phase in the total vibron space is that this space is the cartesian product of the single - mode spaces : the degeneracy points , opening `` holes '' in the space of the first vibron , propagate ( locally , at least ) in the global space along the second - vibron directions .",
    "the global conservation of connectivity in the whole product space is a nontrivial topological problem , whose general outcome is not known to us . in both examples above , we simply note that things go as if the berry phase carried by the first mode is strictly conserved .    in the present situation",
    ", the coupled @xmath48 vibrational mode does not present any topological effect ( a ) , whereas the @xmath50 , as seen in case ( b ) , carries a berry phase .",
    "thus the overall @xmath174 system is affected by topological effects , and this remains true even for different couplings @xmath175 .",
    "the fullerene cations provide a third example of this behavior .",

    ", we expect that in this system the berry phase should be carried by the @xmath177 mode@xcite . that this is indeed the case ,",
    "can thus be seen as a natural consequence of the absence of berry phases in @xmath30 ( i.e.  @xmath178 ) , and its presence in @xmath79 .",
    "so far we have treated the ions as classical .",
    "we study here the consequences of the discussed symmetries of the jtm and of the presence / absence of the berry phase on the quantum spectrum of the coupled system , by quantizing the semiclassical ionic motion .",
    "the general form of the ion kinetic energy is @xmath179 it is convenient to use the classical language for the derivation of the kinetic operator restricted to the semiclassical region : @xmath180 in the semiclassical limit , valid when @xmath55 are very large , the ionic motion is confined to the jtm , itself given by eq .",

    "so(3 )  symmetry , but a qualitatively similar behavior .      in the spin - singlet @xmath23=2 holes case ,",
    "@xmath2c@xmath3 we find two main differences with the @xmath23=1 @xmath0c@xmath1 case .",
    "first , the average distortion @xmath200 is twice as large as in the @xmath23=1 case , @xmath189 and the @xmath140 energy being 4 times as large .",
    "secondly , and most importantly , there is a change in the selection rules .",
    "the two holes live in the same single - hole eigenvector of @xmath201 , the electronic wave function being the product of two equivalent eigenfunctions for the space coordinates and an antisymmetric part for the spin degrees of freedom . since each hole state changes sign after a closed loop in the jtm , the overall hole state does not .",
    "thus the vibrational wave function must also be single - valued in order to have an overall single - valued wave function for the system . as a consequence ,",
    "only even-@xmath94 states survive : in particular , the ground state is @xmath202 ( non - degenerate ) and the first excited state is @xmath203 ( 14-fold degenerate ) .",
    "exact diagonalization results , shown in fig .  [ 2cross2 + 4:fig](b ) , confirm that the symmetry and , to a certain degree the spectral structure described here for the semiclassic limit are retained in the weak - coupling limit .      in the more general non - equal coupling case @xmath206 , including also the @xmath88 case , we could try to use the metric as for the equal coupling in order to obtain an analogous expression for the kinetic energy .",
    "unfortunately , when the couplings are different , we do not get a treatable expression like ( [ ecinetica ] ) , and we can not follow the same route for quantizing the system .",
    "we recall instead that the structure of the jtm is the same as that of es , and in particular that so(5 ) symmetry is retained .",
    "the expression of the minimum potential energy ( [ ejt ] ) suggests a flat jt trough , for any values of the frequencies and couplings .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the free motion of the particle on the jtm is described again by the quadratic casimir operator of so(5 ) , retaining for the low - energy excitations a spectral structure similar to eq .",
    "( [ levels24 ] ) .",
    "however , although the full so(5 ) symmetry is retained in the @xmath207 semiclassical limit , for any non - infinite value of the couplings , the so(5 ) representations will be split into representations of the so(3 ) group @xcite . from this point of view",
    "we can see the differences between the frequencies and between the coupling strengths as symmetry - reducing perturbations , that become effective when moving away from the strong - coupling limit .",
    "this case , corresponding to @xmath208 in a c@xmath209 cation , is very interesting because of the peculiar features described above , i.e. absence of topological singularities and , in particular , absence of a berry phase .",
    "furthermore , this case is worth additional analysis , since it provides an alternate limit of our approach for the different coupling case ( of which this is an extreme case ) .",
    "we treat again the system as a quantization problem on a five - dimensional sphere . in this case",
    ", it is possible to find the extremal eigenvalues of the interaction matrix @xmath210 , as solutions of the characteristic polynomial equation for @xmath114 : @xmath211 where @xmath212 \\ . \\label{f0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this polynomial can be decomposed as @xmath213 = 0.\\ ] ] the extremal eigenvalues of @xmath114 are @xmath214 in accord with the so(5 ) symmetry of the jtm in the 5-dimensional @xmath49 space .",
    "the three remaining intermediate eigenvalues can be expressed as @xmath215 where @xmath216 in order to obtain the eigenenergies of @xmath217 one has to multiply these eigenvalues by a factor @xmath218 . by inspection , @xmath219 are bound in the @xmath220 $ ] interval .",
    "however , it is possible to find many points on the jtm such that @xmath221 , for example the `` south pole '' @xmath222 and a one - dimensional manifold on the `` equator '' @xmath223 .",
    "since @xmath224 is constant and @xmath225 is analytical in @xmath226 , in particular around the tangency points where the two eigenvalues get degenerate , these degeneracies are not conical intersections of the two adiabatic surfaces .",
    "the two surfaces have therefore just a contact of second order at these points .",
    "the absence of conical intersections implies the absence of any topological effect@xcite .",
    "because of the absence of a berry phase , already discussed in sect.[topology : sect ] , the strong coupling behavior of the system , described in terms of the so(5 ) representations , is such that we expect a [ 0,0 ] ( non degenerate ) ground state , a [ 1,0 ] ( fivefold degenerate ) first excited state , a [ 2,0 ] ( 14-fold degenerate ) second excited state , and so on .",
    "moreover , absence of topological effects makes the two - holes case not essentially different from the one - hole problem in the strong coupling limit .",
    "of course , the static jt energy and inertial momentum is just four times larger than in the one hole case , but the level sequence in the strong - coupling limit is the same .    coming back to the single - hole case ,",
    "let us now move away from the strong - coupling limit , to discuss the more general case of an arbitrary coupling @xmath77 .",
    "we might navely expect , at first , the ground state symmetry to be preserved for arbitrary @xmath77 , as was the case in other djt problems examined previously@xcite .",
    "however , a closer inspection reveals that this is not true , and rather that there must be a level crossing as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "a first indication comes from the fact that the ground state must in fact be @xmath4 , i.e. fivefold degenerate , as @xmath227 , reflecting just the uncoupled hole ( @xmath8 ) degeneracy .",
    "a second hint comes from the tangency of the lowest with the second bo surface , noted above .",
    "could this tangency have a role in the expected level crossing from @xmath4 at @xmath228 to @xmath229 at @xmath207 ? to study this possibility , we resort to numerical diagonalization of hamiltonian ( [ hschematica ] ) on a truncated basis ( [ psibasis : eqn ] ) , for finite values of @xmath77 . as pointed out above , for finite coupling the symmetry of the system",
    "is strictly so(3 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the large degeneracies characteristic of so(5 ) symmetry to build up from converging so(3 ) states for large @xmath77 .",
    "the [ 0,0 ] and [ 1,0 ] states map directly on the @xmath230 and @xmath48 so(3 ) representations respectively @xcite , while the so(3 ) composition of [ 2,0 ] is @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , we seek the convergence of two such levels in the strong - coupling limit .    the numerical solution of the 1-hole problem ( see fig .  [ 2cross2:fig](a ) ) , shows indeed the correct order of the levels for large couplings ( @xmath232 ) , whereas for @xmath2338 the [ 0,0 ] and [ 1,0 ] levels cross and become inverted .",
    "this level inversion can in fact be precisely seen as a consequence of the tangency of the two adiabatic potential surfaces described above .",
    "the two bo sheets lie close in a significant region of configuration space . treating the upper sheet as a perturbation for the eigenstates of the lower sheet ,",
    "the energy of all these states is pushed up by this correction . the @xmath202 ( isotropic )",
    "states feel more efficiently this perturbation than the @xmath234 hyperspherical harmonics , since they can arrange their nodes so as to avoid the tangency line . in conclusion ,",
    "the effect of the tangency is to increase the energy of the @xmath202 level more than that of @xmath196 , so that , for coupling not too large , @xmath235 , the latter is the ground state .    in the 2-holes ( spin singlet ) case ( fig .",
    "[ 2cross2:fig](b ) ) this inversion is not present , the ground state being nondegenerate ( @xmath236 ) for any coupling @xmath77 .",
    "again , from a weak - coupling approach , this is a simple consequence of the order of splitting of the d@xmath0-fermion spin - singlet states upon perturbative jt coupling with a @xmath48 vibration , that is ( from lowest to highest ) @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath48 . from the strong - coupling side ,",
    "the only observed crossover happens between the @xmath48 and @xmath237 low excitations above the ground - state .",
    "this means that the bo picture of the two holes in the same single - hole orbital , although appropriate to the strong - coupling limit , is rather poor for intermediate jt coupling , when the two fermions manage to arrange in a cooperative state preserving the global @xmath236 symmetry despite the tangency of the lowest bo sheets .",
    "looking at table [ experener : table ] we can see that there is a single @xmath9 left , that does not pair with any @xmath22 mode .",
    "we must therefore treat the coupling of mode @xmath146 according to the true icosahedral picture .",
    "actually the static @xmath145 jt problem has been treated in the literature@xcite .",
    "the set of absolute minima of the system if made up of ten isolated points in the four - dimensional @xmath9 space .",
    "tunnel splitting among these ten bo valleys give rise to vibronic states of symmetry @xmath239 , @xmath177 , and @xmath72 . in ref .  @xcite the diagonalization of the corresponding matrix has been performed including the proper provision for the berry phase .",
    "the result is that the @xmath72 quintet is the true ground state , followed by the @xmath177 quartet and the @xmath239 singlet in the order .",
    "thus , the berry phase again acts in such a way to enforce a fivefold degenerate ground state all the way from weak to strong coupling , in analogy with the @xmath240 jt problem , and in contrast to the @xmath30 case discussed in sect .",
    "[ 2cross2 ] .",
    "this confirms that , as anticipated , the berry phase in the @xmath241 jt problem comes from @xmath145 sector .",
    "we have studied the symmetry aspects and the possible presence of a berry phase in c@xmath209 and c@xmath3 in the linear and spherical approximation .",
    "we find that while @xmath2c@xmath3 has no berry phase , @xmath0c@xmath1 does , and is very rich and intriguing .",
    "clearly , the present analysis is only a first step . in reality , fullerene is not a sphere , but a discrete icosahedron , and the @xmath50 modes are split into @xmath242 modes .",
    "nonetheless the real shape of the molecule can be seen as a perturbation on the spherical picture ( tab.[experener : table ] ) : the so(5 ) and so(3 ) levels are split but the selection rules are still present . the pik - pryce approach can still be applied in order to obtain the jtm in icosahedral symmetry@xcite .",
    "quite generally the bo potential will warp in such a way to originate a discrete set of minima , instead of a continuous 4-dimensional manifold .",
    "the molecular system will execute tunneling among these minima .",
    "however , as shown by ham@xcite , the berry phase imposes the degeneracy of the ground state ( irrespective of the presence and height of barriers between the bo minima ) , which still is fivefold degenerate ( @xmath243 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect the ground state symmetry to be @xmath244 for real c@xmath209 , which has a berry phase , and @xmath245 for singlet c@xmath3 , which does not .",
    "a quantitative study of the properties of c@xmath209 is clearly beyond the scope of the present work . in order to accomplish",
    "that , a full set of e - v couplings @xmath246 and @xmath247 will have to be known ( either from calculations , or fit to experiments ) , and inserted into a diagonalization procedure similar to that previously carried out in the case of c@xmath248@xcite . while that remains to be done , we can list , for the time being , some tentative physical implications of our results .",
    "\\(i ) _ low - energy electron detachment_. in a way analogous to that proven for the case of c@xmath249 , one can surmize that c@xmath209 can not have any @xmath250 low - energy states .",
    "it follows that if an electron is detached from c@xmath11 into a low - energy state , the s - wave cross - section will be zero . and",
    "there will be a centrifugal barrier in detachment too , similar in nature to that pointed out for attachment@xcite .",
    "this effect could be related to the thermoionic anomalies pointed out by yeretzian _",
    "et al._@xcite    \\(ii ) _ low - energy tunneling excitation_. in the spherical approximation , the lowest excitation of c@xmath11 is a 30-fold degenerate so(5 ) `` @xmath197 '' tunneling multiplet , as required by the berry phase .",
    "split , as it will be by the lower so(3 ) symmetry , as well as by the true @xmath19 effects , this multiplicity might still be identifiable spectroscopically .",
    "c@xmath11 photoemission spectrum_. in the valence photoemission spectrum of c@xmath251 c@xmath252 the electron kinetic energy distribution contains very direct information  in the so - called final state approximation  about vibron and hole - vibron coupling in c@xmath209 .",
    "the outgoing electron shakes up multi - vibron excitations of c@xmath209 , with a relative probability which can be calculated in principle , in a manner similar to that used by gunnarsson@xcite for c@xmath26 .",
    "very recent data@xcite indicate that these shake - ups do exist and are in fact stronger for c@xmath11 than for c@xmath26 .",
