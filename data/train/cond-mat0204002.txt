    "it is well understood that superconductivity produces a gap in the quasiparticle spectra , and in conventional materials this gap disappears as the temperature is increased to @xmath10 where the superconducting electron pairs are no longer bound together .",
    "the problem is that for the underdoped cuprate materials this gap appears to get bigger as @xmath10 gets smaller .",
    "this pseudogap is one of the most puzzling attributes of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "a news article on the pseudogap can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite while a comprehensive review of the various experimental techniques used to determine the pseudogap is given by timusk and statt @xcite .",
    "one way to understand the pseudogap is to postulate that phase - incoherent pairs are established as the material is cooled through the pseudogap temperature @xmath11 and superconductivity takes place at a lower temperature @xmath10 when phase coherence is established @xcite .",
    "an experiment on the sample used in the present study suggested that pre - formed pairs were present in the normal state that leads to superconductivity at a reduced temperature @xcite .",
    "it appeared that preformed pairs might not be present at a temperature as high as @xmath11 , but this could not be conclusively established .",
    "a completely different approach to the problem was taken by varma @xcite , who postulated a state with broken time and rotational symmetry that displayed a pattern of circulating currents ( cc phase ) in the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane .",
    "this state appeared at @xmath11 and for the near optimal doping case ended at a quantum critical point .",
    "the currents of the cc phase would produce a signal visible by a sufficiently sensitive neutron scattering experiment at certain @xmath12 positions in the reciprocal lattice . observing these peaks necessitates a difficult polarized beam experiment that was undertaken @xcite , but no effect could be found .",
    "however , if the scattering was largely two - dimensional as in the present case , it is unlikely the signal would be observed .",
    "circulating currents around the cu - o bonds that resulted from the staggered flux phase of the @xmath13-@xmath14 model were introduced by hsu _",

    "a @xmath6-axis component of the moment direction is thus found for the scattering in region @xmath17 .",
    "in fact an appreciable part of the increase in intensity attributed to region @xmath17 results from @xmath6-axis directed moments .",
    "this can mean that the scattering in region @xmath16 acquires a @xmath6-axis moment component at lower temperatures .",
    "however , it is more likely that an appreciable part of the additional moment in region @xmath17 is directed along the @xmath6-axis .",

    "the scattering in region @xmath17 is thus quite different than that in region @xmath16 thought to result from an impurity phase .",

    "no such impurity scattering has been previously observed .",
    "the correlation lengths of the moments in the @xmath17 phase are also considerably shorter that in the @xmath16 phase .",
    "the work by sidis _",
    "@xcite does not show a distinct @xmath17 phase .",

    "these agree with the expected values for the previously determined magnetic structure @xcite .",

    "this difference is about 61 counts which is larger than that in fig .",

    "7a is about 15 counts demonstrating the small background increase at 70 k.    it is clear that the outer reflections are small or nonexistent for both the @xmath16 and @xmath17 phases .",
    "however , the @xmath16 phase shows only one peak and a mostly featureless ridge of scattering .",
    "this is the signature of a positionally disordered phase in which the outer reflections are spread out so much as to be invisible .",
    "the @xmath17 phase has two clear reflections of comparable width centered on the magnetic lattice .",
    "this is not the signature of a spatially disordered magnet so that the smallness of the outer reflections must stem from another source .",
    "in fact the pattern is quite similar to that expected for @xmath6-axis order as characterized by an intensity ratio for the @xmath95 reflections of 1 , 0.90 , 0.12 , 0 , 0.02 .",
    "this serves to confirm the vf polarized result for region @xmath17 .",
    "it is also similar to the pattern expected for orbital moment scattering @xcite .",
    "however , the data are not sensitive enough to distinguish between the two cases",

    "unfortunately , the large higher order nuclear peak that contaminates the data makes the determination of a small peak difficult .",
    "the expected peak of about 31 counts is not obvious in c and d , but it is difficult to rule it out . there also may be some contribution from region @xmath16 in these scans .",
    "the scan along @xmath55 in e is more useful as a @xmath106 peak would not be expected from region @xmath16 since there is no @xmath71 peak . since the inset with the square points has been scaled up by a factor of 5 , a peak of about 150 counts is expected .",
    "there is no indication of a peak of this size .",
    "this is in favor of an orbital moment interpretation of the moment in region @xmath17 since the form factor would be expected to fall off more quickly in the orbital moment case .",

    "we are now searching for a crystal that shows a stronger magnetic signal , but is free of the high sf background scattering found in the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 crystal .",
    "it is now obvious that searches for a small magnetic moment of the size expected for the ddw state are only accomplished with considerable difficulty .",
    "small static moments are more difficult to observe than dynamics because of the large background from competing nuclear and magnetic scattering .",
    "polarized neutrons appear to be a necessity to get a clear picture of the magnetic scattering .",
    "the problem of obtaining a sample crystal with sufficiently low disorder to observe the ddw state is perhaps the most difficult one .",

    ". this effect may be important in its own right and should be explored further .",
    "any crystal to be used in such experiments obviously has to be carefully characterized .",
    "obvious requirements are a very clean gap and pseudogap .    despite the difficulties our experiments show evidence that a state with an orbital moment may well exist .",
    "such a state would seem to be best characterized by a moment that is predominately directed along the @xmath6-axis and appears at roughly @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath17 phase in our yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 crystal appears to have these properties .",
    "orbital moments should also have a form factor that falls off faster than the spin form factor .",
    "this also appears to be the case for the scattering from the @xmath17 phase .",
    "however , this determination is made difficult by the existence of the high temperature ordered phase .",
    "care also has to be taken that the moment in question is ordered on the crystal lattice as a disordered moment such as that ascribed to the @xmath16 phase also has small outer reflections .",
    "additional measurements are needed to clearly determine the existence of orbital moments and the ddw phase .",
    "it appears that these are best done by obtaining a crystal of the ortho - ii phase without magnetic impurities .",
    "if this is impossible less well ordered crystals like the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath9 sample that show no evidence of impurity scattering may have to be used despite the small magnetic signal .",
    "@xmath121sr measurements like those of sonier _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can observe the effect of very small moments .",
    "however , the moment is difficult to characterize sufficiently well in such experiments to determine its origin .",
    "neutrons can identify if the moments lie on the crystal lattice , the moment direction , and the magnetic form factor .",
    "this is essential information needed to identify orbital scattering .",
    "finally it appears that the cuprates display a number of competing phases so that for instance stripe order may appear in some samples , charge order in others , and orbital order in others yet .",
    "it is thus possible to have experiments that seem to disagree , but are only sampling the order present in a particular sample .",
