    "trading decisions in financial markets are always made based on the often very limited information on stock developments available to the investors .",
    "such information might comprise former and present observed stock returns . although these returns are influenced by some drift term , there is always random variation in observed data . for making trading decisions",
    "it is however of huge importance to know as much as possible about the underlying drift .",
    "another source of information that investors often rely on when it comes to trading are expert opinions .",
    "experts might have some deeper knowledge about the current developments in the market and are therefore able to give a more or less accurate estimate of drift terms at certain times .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate optimal portfolio trading strategies in a financial market where the drift of the stock returns is an unobserved gaussian process .",
    "information about the drift process is obtained from observing stock returns as well as incoming expert opinions that give an unbiased estimate of the current state of the drift at discrete points in time .",
    "an investor s objective is to find a trading strategy that maximizes expected logarithmic utility of her terminal wealth .    without expert opinions",
    "this is a classical utility maximization problem under partial information , meaning that an investor only has the information coming from observing the stock returns and can not see the underlying stochastic drift process directly .",
    "the best estimate in a mean - square sense then is the filter .",
    "while under suitable integrability assumptions existence of optimal trading strategies can be shown , see bjrk , davis and landn  @xcite and lakner  @xcite , we need models which allow for finite - dimensional filters to solve the problem completely including the computation of an optimal policy .",
    "there are essentially two cases which lead to finite - dimensional filters .",
    "firstly , the drift process can be modeled as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( oup ) as above ( including the degenerate case of a static but unobserved random variable ) , or as a continuous time markov chain ( ctmc ) .",
    "the filters are the well - known kalman and wonham filters , respectively , see e.g.  elliott , aggoun and moore  @xcite , liptser and shiryaev  @xcite . in these two models",
    "the solution of the utility maximization problem is known , see brendle  @xcite , lakner  @xcite , putschgl and sass  @xcite and honda  @xcite , rieder and buerle  @xcite , sass and haussmann  @xcite , respectively .",
    "including unbiased expert opinions reduces the variance of the filter .",
    "the better estimate then improves the expected utility .",
    "this can be seen as a continuous - time version of the static black - litterman approach which combines an estimate of the asset returns with expert opinions on the performance of the assets , see black and litterman  @xcite .",
    "frey , gabih and wunderlich  @xcite solve the case of an underlying ctmc with power utility , and gabih , kondakji , sass and wunderlich  @xcite for oup with logarithmic utility . as an approximation ,",
    "also expert opinions arriving continuously in time can be introduced .",
    "this allows for more explicit solutions for the portfolio optimization problem .",
    "davis and lleo  @xcite consider this approach for an underlying oup , sass , seifried and wunderlich  @xcite address the ctmc .",
    "this paper generalizes the results from @xcite , obtained for a market with one stock , to a financial market with @xmath0 stocks and corresponding expert opinions .",
    "the filtering equations we derive are extensions of the one - dimensional case .",
    "the portfolio optimization results carry over to the multivariate case as well , see theorem  [ thm : optimal_value ] .",
    "but the convergence results of @xcite for the conditional variance have no direct equivalents in the multivariate case , since they require and state very detailed monotonicity properties and bounds",
    ". instead we choose suitable norms , e.g.  the spectral norm , and here lie our main contributions .",
    "the convergence of the norms of the conditional covariances for an increasing number of expert opinions to zero can now be shown , see theorem  [ thm : asymptotics_for_n_to_infinity ] .",
    "the convergence of the norms for equidistant expert opinions on an infinite time horizon is more delicate , in particular when requiring monotonicity between the expert opinions which reflects the decreasing impact of the expert opinions over time .",
    "here we state several results , showing convergence under certain conditions , see e.g.  theorem  [ thm : trace_of_gamma_e ] , as well as providing counterexamples if these conditions do not hold .    in detail",
    "we proceed as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : market_model_and_filtering_equations ] we introduce our financial market model .",
    "we assume that the drift of the stock returns is a multivariate ornstein - uhlenbeck process with dynamics @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4}$ ] is a @xmath5-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "the drift can not be observed by the participants in the market . aside from the stock prices ,",
    "further estimates on the current state of the drift arrive in form of expert opinions .",
    "we introduce the concept of expert opinions and specify different settings of information that is available to an investor .",
    "we assume that one investor observes stock returns only , another one only uses expert opinions for making trading decisions .",
    "a third investor is assumed to have access to both of these sources of information .",
    "the second part of section  [ sec : market_model_and_filtering_equations ] states the corresponding filtering equations . these give the dynamics of the filter and of the conditional covariance matrices . in the case of return observations only , the filter is the classical kalman filter , see for example liptser and shiryaev  @xcite .",
    "when we include expert opinions we make use of the discrete - time kalman filter as described in elliott , aggoun and moore  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : properties_of_the_conditional_covariance_matrix ] analyzes the conditional covariance matrices .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ thm : asymptotics_for_n_to_infinity ] shows the limiting behaviour for an increasing number of expert opinions with some minimal reliability on a finite time horizon . this is a generalization of proposition  4.3 from gabih et al .",
    "@xcite . in section  [ sec : asymptotic_results_for_an_infinite_time_horizon ] , we analyze the limiting behaviour of the conditional covariance matrices on an infinite time horizon with regularly arriving expert opinions . in this context",
    "it is important to mention that the conditional covariance matrices for the investor who observes stock returns only and for the investor observing stock returns as well as expert opinions follow a matrix riccati equation .",
    "in contrast to the one - dimensional situation this ordinary differential equation does not have a closed - form solution which makes the analysis harder .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to prove some limiting behaviour in these cases by using basic properties of riccati differential equations as for example provided in kucera  @xcite , wonham  @xcite , bucy  @xcite and mrtensson  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the conditional covariance matrices are helpful when looking at the portfolio optimization problem that we address in section  [ sec : portfolio_optimization_problem ] .",
    "we consider maximization of expected logarithmic utility of terminal wealth . the optimal strategy and value function for the different investors",
    "are computed along the lines of gabih et al .",
    "it turns out that the optimal value is a function of the corresponding conditional covariance matrices .",
    "hence , the remaining part of the section concentrates on proving properties of the value function that can be deduced from properties of the covariance matrices .",
    "in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] we provide some simulations of filters and value functions that illustrate our theoretical results .",
    "we also take a short look at the concept of efficiency to analyze the value of information obtained from different sources of information .",
