    "since the introduction of the thomas - reiche - kuhn  @xcite and the bethe  @xcite sum rules , quantum mechanical sum rules have been widely applied to many fields of physics , including fundamental particles  , atomic nuclei   and nuclear matter  . the definition of the term `` sum rule '' ( sr ) may vary in different physical problems . in the studies of atomic nuclei ,",
    "energy - dependent sum rules are often referred to the spectral integration over a nuclear response function with an energy - dependent weight function .",
    "the response function is associated with transitions between the ground and excited states of a nucleus due to an external probe .",
    "the srs reflect important information about the structure and properties of nuclei .",
    "they are also key ingredients in calculating nuclear polarization effects on the spectrum of muonic atoms , which have recently drawn renewed interest  .",
    "since the response function is related to the reaction cross section through kinematic factors , the corresponding sr can be evaluated through an integration over the appropriate cross section obtained from experiments . however , when there are no available data , or when the measurements are either limited in energy range or too scattered for a reliable estimation of the response function , one must rely on theory for evaluating the srs . in many cases srs",
    "can be directly obtained from ground - state expectation values of operators , and in some special cases they can even be evaluated in a model independent or quasi - independent way  @xcite .",
    "best known examples are the thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rule  @xcite and the bremsstrahlung sum rule  .",
    "they are associated with the first two spectral moments of the unretarded electric dipole response function , which corresponds to the dominant contribution in nuclear photoabsorption reactions .",
    "in general , a sum rule may contain a weight function in a rather complex form ( see , e.g. ,  ) and can not simply be written as a ground - state expectation value . in such cases , a theoretical evaluation of the sr requires a calculation of the response function , followed by an explicit integration over all the relevant excitation spectrum .",
    "an _ ab - initio _ solution of all the continuum states is a rather challenging task , often out of reach .",
    "therefore , using indirect methods , such as the lorentz integral transform ( lit )  @xcite , is presently the only viable way for calculating the response functions in an ab - initio approach ( c.f .",
    "@xcite for a recent update ) , and consequently the sr . even then , obtaining accurate results from an explicit integration of the response function may be a rather demanding task , especially when the sr is relatively sensitive to the high - energy part of the response function .    here , we use the lanczos algorithm  @xcite to derive a generalized numerical technique for evaluating srs , dubbed ` the laczos sum rule ( lsr ) method ' , which avoids the complications associated with explicitly calculating the continuum states or even the response function .",
    "similar lsr methods have been applied to study sum rules associated with gamow - teller and electromagnetic transitions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , whose spectral weights only included integer powers of the energy .",
    "in essence , in this paper we extend the sum rule method applied in ref .",
    "@xcite for evaluating the electric polarizability  @xcite to srs with energy - dependent weight function of a more general form .",
    "we define a general sr @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy - dependent weight function , and @xmath3 is the response function describing the excitation probabilities of a nucleus due to some external probe .",
    "the response function is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the transition operator ( e.g. , an electric dipole or quadrupole operator ) .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the initial and final eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath8 with eigenvalues @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . the @xmath11 symbol in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_omg ] ) indicates a sum over the discrete part of the spectrum and an integral over the continuum states . throughout our discussion",
    ", the weight function @xmath2 can have an arbitrary analytical form , restricted to only two conditions : @xmath12 the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) is regular , and @xmath13 the integral   exists and is finite .",
    "the lower bound of the integral is the lowest excitation energy of the system , .",
    "the upper bound is unlimited , however , for a given desired accuracy it can be regarded finite , since @xmath3 vanishes for .    to calculate @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 one often expands them on a complete discrete set of localized basis states , effectively truncated at some finite basis size @xmath14 , and then diagonalizes the hamiltonian @xmath8 , obtaining a set of eigenstates @xmath15 and corresponding eigenvalues @xmath16 .",
    "the states @xmath15 are not real eigenstates of the physical hamiltonian , but can be regarded as the discrete set of eigenstates that emerge when the system is confined in a finite volume . for energies below the continuum threshold @xmath17 ,",
    "the states @xmath18 are controlled approximations of the true bound states that improve by increasing the basis size @xmath14 . for @xmath19 ,",
    "these states are viewed as a discretized approximation of the continuum that gradually fills in the continuum as the basis size is increased . in terms of this discrete basis , the sr of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) becomes a sum over the transition probabilities from the ground state to the discretized excited states , weighted by the function : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the excitation energy and the sum runs over all states but the ground state . here",
    ", the index @xmath14 denotes the fact that we are working with discrete states in a finite model space of size @xmath14 .",
    "naively , @xmath22 may be expected to converge to the sr s physical value , @xmath23 , as @xmath14 increases . however , the verity and rate of the convergence require further investigation .",
    "additionally , in many calculations a complete diagonalization of the hamiltonian is computationally impractical .",
    "the lanczos algorithm  @xcite can be introduced to handle the problem of large - model - space diagonalization .",
    "based on a recursive mapping of the full @xmath24 hamiltonian matrix into a tridiagonal matrix @xmath25 whose dimension @xmath26 is much smaller than @xmath14 , the lanczos algorithm effectively preserves information on the low - lying eigenstates and spectral moments  @xcite . using the lanczos algorithm , the sr in eq .   becomes @xmath27 here the index @xmath26 denotes the number of lanczos iterations , @xmath28 is the unitary transformation matrix that diagonalizes @xmath25 , and , where @xmath29 is the @xmath30-th eigenvalue of @xmath25 .    due to the advantage of the lanczos algorithm",
    ", @xmath31 converges rapidly to @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath32 for a sufficiently large @xmath26 , which turns out to be much smaller than the size of the discretized basis @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath33 is established , we obtain that @xmath34 , where @xmath26 can be kept relatively small .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "( [ sr_lanc ] ) , as the main point of this paper , provides an efficient way to calculate srs using the lanczos algorithm , where the weight functions are more generalized than just integer powers of @xmath35 as in the traditional first moments of a distribution  @xcite .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we will present a theoretical derivation of eq .",
    "( [ sr_lanc ] ) . using the properties of lorentz integral",
    "transform ( lit ) , we will discuss the conditions for which @xmath22 , and therefore also @xmath31 , converge to @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , in sec .  [ derivation ] we will prove that @xmath12 eq .",
    "( [ i_sum ] ) is exact if the inverse lit of the weight function @xmath36 exists , and @xmath13 @xmath22 converges to @xmath23 at the same rate as the lit does . in sec .",
    "[ existence ] , we obtain the constraints required for the existence of the inverse lit of @xmath36 , which follow from the properties of the response function and the analytic form of @xmath37 . in sec .",
    "[ lanczos ] we illustrate the technical details behind the derivation of eq .  , based on the lanczos algorithm . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we show the practical convergence rate of the lsr method with respect to the lanczos step @xmath26 for sum rules associated with the electric dipole transition , emphasizing that a rapid convergence in @xmath26 can be reached for a variety of weight functions .",
    "as detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the response function can be obtained from a numerical calculation using its lorentz integral transform ( lit ) @xmath38 which is an integral transform of the response function with a lorentzian kernel . in order to prove the validity of evaluating the sr of eq .   using the square - integrable basis represented by eq .",
    ", we assume that there exists a function @xmath39 such that the weight function @xmath36 in eq .",
    "can be presented in the form @xmath40 comparing eqs .",
    "and we find that the relation between @xmath36 and @xmath39 is similar to the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath3 .",
    "there is , however , one important difference : for any physical response function , the lit integral @xmath42 is well defined .",
    "in contrast , the existence of @xmath39 is not self evident , and the conditions under which @xmath39 exists will be discussed in the next section . at this moment",
    "we shall carry out our arguments assuming that ( [ h_sgm ] ) holds .    inserting the lit representation of the weight function ( [ h_sgm ] ) into the sr of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sr ] ) and changing the order of integration , we rewrite the sr in terms of the lit function @xmath42 instead of @xmath3 @xmath43 similar to eq .  , also here the integration limits can be regarded as effectively finite , due to the properties of @xmath44 .",
    "the advantage of introducing the lit function @xmath42 stems from the fact that it can be calculated numerically using a set of localized basis functions with bound - state - like boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is much simpler to calculate @xmath42 than the response function itself .",
    "we expand @xmath42 over the set of square - integrable basis functions @xmath18 that diagonalizes the hamiltonian , obtaining @xmath45 substituting the calculated @xmath46 of eq .   into",
    "we recover eq .   for @xmath22 , which is to some extent an intuitive discrete representation of the sr .",
    "nevertheless , with this derivation we have further justified the use of a localized basis .",
    "if we consider an expansion on a basis of size @xmath14 , such that the accuracy of the calculated function @xmath46 is within @xmath47 , @xmath48 then the accuracy of @xmath22 calculated using the same basis can be bounded by @xmath49 therefore , if the function @xmath39 exists and the integral @xmath50 on the right - hand - side of eq",
    ".   is finite , then the discretized sr in eq .",
    "converges to the exact sum rule @xmath23 at the same rate as @xmath46 converges to @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , the discrete representation becomes exact when the lit function converges to its exact value without any need to recover the continuum limit . in the following",
    "we will present a more rigorous discussion on the conditions for which @xmath39 exists and on the convergence properties of @xmath22 constrained by eq .  .",
    "in this section we will explore the conditions for which we can locate such a function @xmath39 , which satisfies that @xmath50 is finite , and the implications on the convergence of the calculated sr .",
    "to this end , we use the fourier transform and utilize the fourier representation of the lorentzian kernel  @xcite @xmath51 so that we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ h_sgm ] ) in the following form @xmath52 we define the fourier transforms of @xmath37 and @xmath53 , respectively , as @xmath54 and obtain from eq .   a simple relation between them @xmath55 performing the inverse fourier transform on eq .",
    "we obtain the function @xmath39 as  @xcite @xmath56 this relation provides us with a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of @xmath39 : if the integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ h_ft ] ) converges , @xmath39 is well defined ; otherwise we can not find @xmath39 that fulfills eq .",
    "( [ h_sgm ] ) exactly .",
    "we first provide an extreme example , where @xmath36 is a dirac delta function @xmath57 , whose fourier transform is @xmath58 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain that the integral in eq .",
    "diverges in this case .",
    "however , in many cases the weight function @xmath36 will be a continuous function , which can be expanded using a complete set of square - integrable basis functions . in practice , in bound nuclear systems",
    "the response function @xmath3 provides a lower bound for the integral in eq .   at the lowest excitation energy @xmath59 , and vanishes for .",
    "therefore , the weight function @xmath36 only needs to be known over a finite range of @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , the weight function @xmath36 may be approximated by a finite number of basis functions , i.e. , @xmath60 , as long as the mntz - szsz condition  @xcite is fulfilled .    here ,",
    "we provide two common choices of complete basis sets , lorentzians and gaussians integral bases , respectively . in the lorentzian basis , represented by @xmath61 the fourier transform of the basis function @xmath62 yields . by substituting it in eq .",
    ", we obtain the inverse transform @xmath63 only for @xmath64 . under this condition ,",
    "is finite and thus fulfills the requirement from eq .  .",
    "however , when the weight function is narrowly peaked at a particular value of @xmath35 , then in order for it to be adequately described , the expansion must include a lorentzian function @xmath65 that has a similar narrow width , i.e. , a small value of @xmath66 . in this case , the condition @xmath67 can become prohibitively difficult to satisfy , due to the numerical properties of the lit method : the convergence rate of @xmath46 to @xmath42 worsens as @xmath68 .",
    "for the gaussian basis , expressed as @xmath69 the fourier transform of the basis function @xmath62 leads to @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , we substitute it into eq .  , and find the inverse transform in this case to be @xmath71 \\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath72\\exp{(z^2)}\\ ] ] and @xmath73 .",
    "the function @xmath74 is the error function defined by @xmath75 as shown numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_i_erf ] , @xmath76 is symmetric around its peak value at @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 , and vanishes rapidly as the value of @xmath79 increases . therefore , one can demonstrate that the integral @xmath80 will be finite , provided that @xmath81 s peak value , @xmath82 , is finite .",
    "however , @xmath82 grows extremely fast with increasing @xmath83 , because of its @xmath84 component , and so does the integral @xmath85 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath36 can be adequately described by a set of gaussian basis functions , then the corresponding function @xmath86 can be constructed , and the convergence condition required by eq",
    ".   holds if @xmath83 is kept small .",
    "however , again it is evident that calculation of srs associated with narrowly peaked weight functions may become prohibitively difficult . this situation , manifested in the gaussian basis by the presence of a @xmath62 with small @xmath66 , makes it challenging to find an appropriate @xmath87 that is large enough to make @xmath88 converge at a reasonable rate , and small enough to keep @xmath84 small .     of eq .",

    "@xmath76 is rescaled by division with its peak value at @xmath77.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    these examples indicate the robustness of the lsr method in the general case . however , the short coming of the method is to resolve srs whose energy weight contain very narrow features or discontinuities . in practice ,",
    "the convergence of the results need to be verified numerically for each case individually .",
    "the calculation of the sr in eq .",
    "( [ i_sum ] ) , as well as the calculation of the lit of eq .",
    "( [ l_epsmu_diag ] ) , involves a summation over the entire spectrum of @xmath90 using a discretized complete basis expansion . however , the basis size @xmath14 required to obtain converged results is usually too large to allow a direct diagonalization of @xmath90 . to overcome this problem in the lit method ,",
    "the use of the lanczos algorithm was introduced  @xcite .",
    "this practice has been successfully applied to many electroweak processes of light nuclei  @xcite . in these cases , it was found that with sufficiently large number of lanczos steps , which is still much smaller than the basis size , @xmath88 can converge to the exact value @xmath91 within a sub - percentage accuracy .    following this example ,",
    "we seek an equivalent formalism for calculating the sr using the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in the krilov subspace  @xcite @xmath92 .",
    "the appropriate choice of the starting vector @xmath93 is the normalized transition vector @xmath94 using the lanczos algorithm @xcite one can straightforwardly construct an orthonormal basis @xmath95 to the krilov subspace . in the lanczos algorithm one represents @xmath8 , which is an @xmath24 matrix , by the tridiagonal @xmath96 matrix @xmath97 where @xmath98 . @xmath99 and @xmath100 are constructed through the lanczos iterations , @xmath101 where the coefficients @xmath102 and @xmath103 are obtained as @xmath104 this representation effectively provides the distribution of the starting vector @xmath93 on the low - lying spectrum of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the tridiagonal matrix @xmath99 can be easily diagonalized through unitary transformation @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "the first @xmath26 eigenstates of @xmath107 approximated by the lanczos algorithm are therefore given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 satisfies .",
    "if we now substitute the discrete sum over the states @xmath15 in eq .   with a sum over",
    "the @xmath26 approximated eigenstates @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath110 which yields eq .   given in the introduction . in this form",
    ", the calculated sr depends only on the norm of the transition vector and on the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the lanczos matrix @xmath99 .",
    "furthermore , this sum converges very rapidly with increasing @xmath26 , due to the excellent convergence properties of the lanczos algorithm  . in practice",
    "we have found that a few hundred lanczos steps @xmath26 , which is much less than the basis size @xmath14 , are sufficient for convergence of the most commonly used srs .",
    "we would like to add two comments regarding the application of eq .  :",
    "( i ) if one is only interested in the inelastic response , then the initial state should be excluded from the sum in eq .  .",
    "( ii ) the sr defined in eq .",
    "is equivalent to the ground state expectation value , which is finite even with functions @xmath36 for which the integral   does not exist .",
    "as an example for the application of the proposed lsr method , we consider the unretarded dipole response function of the @xmath0he nucleus , calculated using the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics ( eihh ) method  @xcite .",
    "this response function was first calculated for @xmath0he using a modern nuclear hamiltonian in ref .",
    "more recently , it was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate nuclear polarizability effects in muonic  @xmath0he .",
    "here we use the same model space as in  @xcite . in the hamiltonian @xmath90",
    "we adopt the chiral effective field theory potential , including two - nucleon interactions up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order , and three - nucleon interactions up to next - to - next - to - leading order  @xcite , with parametrization from ref .",
    "@xcite . the dipole response function @xmath111 is defined as in eq .",

    "[ fig : conv ] we demonstrate the convergence of the lsr method for dipole sum rules with weight functions defined as @xmath117 it can be seen that when calculating these srs as in eq .",
    "( [ sr_lanc_2 ] ) , @xmath118 lanczos steps are sufficient for convergence .",
    "this should be compared with @xmath119 , the size of the model space used in this calculation .",
    "indeed , a slightly slower convergence is obtained for more negative powers of @xmath35 , since @xmath36 becomes relatively narrower at the origin .",
    "however , this does not create practical difficulties to obtain convergence .",
    "these examples demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the lsr method .",

    "our result for @xmath120 of @xmath0he is @xmath122 @xmath123 , which is in agreement with a previous calculation  @xcite , considering the accuracy estimated there .",
    ".energy - dependent srs of the unretarded dipole response of @xmath0he . a comparison between the lanczos sum - rule method ( lsr ) and an explicit integration of the response function ( esr ) .",
    "both calculations are made with the same model space as in  @xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tbl : compare ] we compare the energy - dependent srs calculated using the lsr method with srs obtained from an explicit integration of the response function ( esr ) as in eq .",
    "( [ esr ] ) , for various weight functions @xmath36 .",
    "it can be seen that there is an excellent agreement between the two methods .",
    "one should keep in mind that when the many - body hamiltonian needs to be solved , as in this example , the calculation of the response function is always limited in accuracy .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that the relative difference between the results of the two methods is rather small for most srs . in this example , the response function used for explicit integration was only calculated up to @xmath124  mev .",
    "this leads to a varying error in the esr results .",
    "obviously , this error is larger for weight functions with higher powers of @xmath35 , as can be seen from the difference between the esr and lsr results for @xmath125 in table  [ tbl : compare ] .",
    "we note that the numerical accuracy of the lit method , and therefore also of the lsr , is at the sub - percentage level ( see ref .",
    "we have presented an efficient algorithm for evaluating a generalized energy - dependent sum rule and discussed its properties and applicability . with the proposed method one can calculate sum rules without explicitly calculating the continuum states or the response function , thus achieving better accuracy .",
    "we have shown that the convergence rate of the calculated sum rule is bounded by the convergence rate of the lit function times a factor , whose magnitude depends on the structure of the weight function .",
    "a set of localized basis functions can be used to calculate the sum rule , and using the lanczos algorithm we have demonstrated that a few hundred steps of lanczos iterations are sufficient to achieve a reasonable accuracy . in fact , this is an order of magnitude lower than the number of lanczos steps needed to calculate the corresponding response function using the lit method .",
    "this suggests that the proposed method can be valuable also in other cases , for example to calculate polarization corrections in other muonic atoms , as well as any energy - dependent sum rule that is of relevance in electro - weak reactions of nuclei .",

    "<S> energy - dependent sum rules are useful tools in many fields of physics . in nuclear physics </S>",
    "<S> , they typically involve an integration of the response function over the nuclear spectrum with a weight function composed of integer powers of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> more complicated weight functions are also encountered , e.g. , in nuclear polarization corrections of atomic spectra . using the lorentz integral transform method and the lanczos algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a computationally efficient technique for evaluating such sum rules that avoids the explicit calculation of both the continuum states and the response function itself . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results for electric dipole sum rules of the @xmath0he nucleus with various energy - dependent weights show rapid convergence with respect to the number of lanczos steps . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the usefulness of the method in a variety of electroweak reactions . </S>"
