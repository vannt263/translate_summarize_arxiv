    "a quantum critical point ( qcp ) separates thermodynamic phases of matter at zero temperature and occurs when the order vanishes continuously as the zero - temperature phase transition is approached from the ordered side@xcite .",
    "quantum criticality has attracted considerable attention in recent years .",
    "this is not only due to the fact that quantum critical fluctuations are important in a broad temperature range around a qcp but has largely been fueled by the realization that not all continuous zero - temperature phase transitions may be described in terms of an order - parameter functional in elevated dimension@xcite .",
    "the clearest experimental indication for such unconventional quantum criticality has so far come from anti - ferromagnetic heavy fermion metals@xcite .",
    "the magnetic energy scales in these systems are small enough to tune the system from an itinerant anti - ferromagnet to a paramagnetic metal as an external tuning parameter is varied . in the traditional approach to the qcp in itinerant anti - ferromagnets ,",
    "universal properties are described in terms of a ginzburg - landau - wilson functional of the order parameter and its fluctuations resulting in a @xmath1-theory in @xmath2 dimensions , where @xmath3 is the dynamical exponent and @xmath4 is the spatial dimension of the system@xcite .",
    "in contrast , a number of compounds which can be tuned through a zero - temperature transition do not follow the predictions of such a spin - density wave ( sdw ) theory@xcite .",
    "this has led to the understanding that the concomitant destruction of the kondo screening of the f - moments may result in an altered critical fluctuation spectrum@xcite .",
    "one scenario , characterized by critical kondo screening at the zero - temperature phase transition that is able to explain the experimental findings that are at variance with the conventional sdw picture has been termed local quantum criticality@xcite .",
    "a microscopic approach to the problem which preserves the dynamic competition between kondo screening and magnetic correlations and consequently can capture the critical kondo destruction is given by the extended dynamical mean field theory ( edmft)@xcite .",
    "within edmft , the kondo lattice is mapped onto a quantum impurity model where a local moment is coupled to a fermionic and a bosonic bath and augmented with self - consistency requirements@xcite .",
    "this quantum impurity model is called the bose - fermi kondo model ( bfkm ) .",
    "the bfkm is , however , not only of interest in the context of the edmft approach to quantum critical heavy fermion compounds .",
    "the bfkm is also the effective low - energy model of single - electron transistors with ferromagnetic leads@xcite and of coulomb - blockaded noisy quantum dots@xcite .",
    "an interesting and important question is , under which conditions the qcp in the bfkm may be unconventional . after all , the edmft approach to the kondo lattice preserves the dynamic competition between the local kondo screening at each f - moment site and the magnetic fluctuations among different f - moments .",
    "so far , this question has been addressed in the spin - isotropic and the easy - axis bfkm and the spin - boson model@xcite .",
    "based on a dynamical large - n limit , it was shown that the qcp in the spin - isotropic bfkm is in general not described in terms of a local @xmath1-theory@xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the critical behavior of a classical spin chain in @xmath5 dimension with a long - ranged interaction that is compatible with the retarded spin - spin interaction of the bfkm generated by the coupling to the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "as it turns out , the difference between the critical properties of the spin - isotropic bfkm and the classical spin chain is not spoiled by 1/n - corrections but can be traced back to the presence of a berry phase term in the spin path integral representation of the quantum problem@xcite .",
    "the quantum - to - classical mapping of quantum criticality that links a quantum - critical system to a @xmath2-dimensional classical critical system , therefore does not hold for the spin - isotropic bfkm  @xcite .",
    "the situation is at present less clear for the ( spin - anisotropic ) easy - axis bfkm and the spin - boson problem .",
    "while the two models are expected to belong to the same universality class , it is not clear whether the critical theory of the two models is identical to those of a local @xmath1-theory@xcite .",
    "numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations point to a critical theory that is different from a local @xmath1-theory  @xcite .",
    "the validity of such nrg calculations for critical systems involving bosons has however been called into question  @xcite . a recent continuous time monte carlo study  @xcite addresses the dissipative spin - boson model based on a monte carlo algorithm that explicitly takes the limit of vanishing lattice constant of a one - dimensional classical ising chain  @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , it was pointed out that the continuum limit of the classical monte carlo misses the effects associated with properly regularizing the spin - flip terms .",
    "these topological excitations can be viewed as the analogue in the ising case of the berry phase effect in the spin - symmetric problem .",
    "this raises the question of the proper path integral of the spin - boson model and related ising - anisotropic models in the continuum limit .",
    "+ in what follows , i point out the role of the berry phase in the path integral representation of the spin - boson model .    the sub - ohmic spin - boson model is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are generators of the su(2 ) algebra and @xmath9 and @xmath10 follow bosonic commutation relations . for a sub - ohmic spectral density of the bosons , @xmath11\\sim |\\omega|^{1-\\eta } \\mbox{sgn}(\\omega),~ \\mbox{for}~~|\\omega|<\\lambda,\\ ] ] with @xmath12 , the system undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition at a critical coupling @xmath13 that separates a localized from a delocalized phase .",

    "e.g. one can bring to bear its relation with the action of classical mechanics . for a problem involving spin",
    "this relation is less obvious and functional integral methods for spin systems are far less popular .",

    "when the quantum spin is coupled to the bosonic bath , it turns out that the continuum limit ( @xmath182 in eq .",
    "( [ partition1 ] ) ) in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 , i.e. the ising degrees of freedom , can not be taken in a straightforward manner and the quantum - to - classical mapping to a classical ising chain with long - ranged interaction can not easily be carried through .",
    "the problems that underlie the continuum limit can be traced back to the spin flips from one eigenvalue of @xmath8 to the other . a physical interpretation of why the limit of vanishing lattice constant ( while number of ising spins approaches infinity ) of a classical ising chain with a long - ranged interaction ( corresponding to the retarded interaction generated by the bosons ) fails to be equivalent to the sub - ohmic bose - fermi kondo model , was given in reference  @xcite .",
    "this line of arguments is therefore complementary to the approach taken here .",
    "finally , i demonstrated that a spin - coherent state basis circumvents the associated difficulties , so that both the continuum limit can be performed and the bosonic field can be integrated out . to this end , a basic introduction to spin coherent states was presented that draws from the analogy to bosonic coherent states .",
    "the functional integral for spin in terms of spin coherent states is formulated on the unit sphere @xmath128 , the coset space of su(2 ) .",
    "since the su(2 ) group can decomposed as su(2)=@xmath199u(1 ) and u(1 ) is multiply connected while su(2 ) is simply connected , any coordinate system on @xmath128 must necessarily be singular . as a result ,",
    "a berry phase term arises in the spin path integral out of this geometric property of @xmath128 and the effective action for the spin degrees of freedom does not assume the form of a ginzburg - landau - wilson functional . that such a berry phase is responsible for the non - classical behavior of the totally spin - isotropic",
    ", sub - ohmic bose - fermi kondo model has been demonstrated in reference  @xcite .",
    "numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) studies on the easy - axis bose - fermi kondo model , which is closely related to the spin - boson model discussed here , indeed suggest a breakdown of the quantum - to - classical mapping for this model as well  @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the nrg to critical systems involving bosons has recently been called into question  @xcite .",
    "the main supportive evidence for such an apparent shortcoming of the nrg method seems to have come from a recent classical monte carlo study  @xcite , whose relevance to the spin - boson problem , as i have shown here , needs to be re - examined .",
