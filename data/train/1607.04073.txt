    "the main goal of heavy - ion collision ( hic ) physics is the study of the behavior of nuclear matter at high temperatures and/or high densities . in particular , the major interest is the investigation of the nuclear matter phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential . according to quantum - chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , at large temperatures and densities the hadrons can not survive anymore as bound states and they dissolve forming the so - called quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) . at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )",
    "energies for the first time the creation of a qgp , identified as an almost perfect fluid @xcite , has been proven experimentally .",
    "actually , the properties of this deconfined state of matter are still debated as well as the phase boundaries to the hadronic phase . in order to shed some light on this issue ,",
    "many heavy - ion experiments are performed at the super - proton synchrotron ( sps ) , rhic , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and will be performed at the future facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) as well as the nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) .",
    "the crucial challenge is to identify in the final particle distributions those signatures , which allow to disentangle the qgp contribution that is impossible to observe directly or independently .",
    "the strange particle production has always been suggested as one of the most sensitive observables that could spot out the creation of a qgp during the early stages of a hic .",
    "the earliest suggested signature is the strangeness enhancement in a+a collisions with respect to elementary p+p collisions @xcite .",
    "later on , gazdzicki and gorenstein @xcite proposed that a sharp rise and drop in the excitation function of the @xmath4 ratio ( so called `` horn '' ) should show up due to the appearance of a qgp phase at a center - of - mass energy @xmath7gev .",
    "several statistical models @xcite have succeeded in reproducing the trend of the experimental observation of the @xmath4 ratio and other strange to non - strange particle ratios , but they can provide only a statistical description of the heavy - ion collision process . on the other hand there was no conclusive interpretation of the `` horn '' from dynamical approaches for hic , like microscopic transport models @xcite .",
    "only recently , the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) , a transport approach describing hic on the basis of partonic , hadronic and string degrees - of - freedom , obtained a striking improvement on this issue when including chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) in the string decay for hadronic particle production @xcite . within the phsd approach",
    "it has been suggested that the horn feature emerges in the energy - dependence of the @xmath4 ratio , both due to csr , which is responsible for the rise at low energies , and to the appearance of a deconfined partonic medium at higher energies , which is responsible for the drop at top sps energies .",
    "apart from deconfinement the chiral symmetry restoration addresses another aspect of the qcd phase diagram in the ( @xmath8)-plane as an additional transition between a phase with broken and a phase with restored chiral symmetry . as in case of the qcd deconfinement phase transition ,",
    "the boundaries of the csr phase transition line are not well known .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations show that at vanishing baryon chemical potential @xmath9=0 the csr takes place at roughly the same critical temperature and energy density as the deconfinement phase transition which is a crossover . at finite baryon",
    "chemical potential lqcd calculations can not be performed due to the sign problem and one must rely on effective models ( or extrapolations ) in order to study the qcd phase transitions @xcite .",
    "different models support the idea that at finite chemical potential a partially restored phase is achieved before the deconfinement occurs @xcite . in order to distinguish the two phases of such a transition",
    ", effective models use the scalar quark condensate @xmath10 as an order parameter . as the baryon density and temperature increase , the scalar quark condensate @xmath10 is expected to decrease from a non - vanishing value in the vacuum to @xmath11 which corresponds to csr .",
    "since @xmath12 is not a measurable quantity , it is crucial to determine experimental observables which are sensitive to this feature .",
    "since long the dilepton spectroscopy has been in the focus in this respect since in a chirally restored phase the spectral functions of the the @xmath13- and the @xmath14-meson should become identical .",
    "however , no clear evidence has been achieved so far @xcite . on the other hand , the strangeness production at alternating - gradient synchrotron ( ags ) and",
    "lower sps energies was suggested to be a signature of csr @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will perform a systematic study within the phsd approach on effects of the csr on final particle distributions in hics in the energy range @xmath15gev .",
    "the phsd is particularly suited to this aim since it includes both hadronic and partonic degrees - of - freedom @xcite and has been extensively used to describe hic observables from sps to lhc energies @xcite .",
    "this study is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly recall the basic ingredients of the phsd approach , while in sec .",
    "iii we illustrate the string fragmentation included in phsd and the most recent extension of this particle production mechanism to incorporate essential aspects of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "we also discuss the sensitivity of our results on different parameter settings for the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) within the non - linear @xmath1 model and examine the role of three - meson channels for strangeness production ( @xmath16 ) . in sec .",
    "iv we present the calculated results from phsd  with and without the inclusion of csr  for particle spectra , yields and ratios in central a+a collisions from 2 to 158agev , with a special focus on the strange particle production . a comparison with experimental data",
    "is performed wherever possible . in sec .",
    "v we explore new aspects of csr in heavy - ion collisions , i.e. the system size and the centrality dependence of strange particle yields and ratios . in sec .",
    "vi we focus on the equilibrium stages of the time evolution of central au+au collisions in connection to strangeness production in the ( @xmath17)-plane and discuss the perspectives to identify a critical point in the phase diagram .",
    "we conclude this work with a summary in sec.vii .",
    "the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) is a microscopic covariant dynamical approach for strongly interacting systems in and out - of equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it is a transport approach which goes beyond the quasi - particle approximation , since it is based on kadanoff - baym equations for the greens functions in phase - space representation in first - order gradient expansion @xcite . including both a hadronic and a partonic phase as well as a transition between the effective degrees - of - freedom , phsd is capable to describe the full time evolution of a relativistic heavy - ion collision . the theoretical description of the partonic degrees - of - freedom ( quarks and gluons ) is realized in line with the dynamical - quasi - particle model ( dqpm ) @xcite which reproduces lqcd results in thermodynamical equilibrium and provides the properties of the partons , i.e. masses and widths in their spectral functions . in equilibrium",
    "the phsd reproduces the partonic transport coefficients such as shear and bulk viscosities or the electric conductivity from lqcd calculations as well @xcite .",
    "an actual nucleus - nucleus collision in phsd follows the following steps :    * primary hard scatterings between nucleons take place and produce excited color - singlet states , denoted by `` strings '' ( as described within the fritiof lund model @xcite and realized also in pythia 6.4 @xcite ) .",
    "these strings decay into `` prehadrons '' with a formation time @xmath18fm / c and `` leading hadrons '' , which originate from the string ends and can re - interact with hadrons almost instantly with reduced cross - sections ( according to the constituent quark number ) . * in case the local energy density is above the critical value of @xmath19gev/@xmath20 , the deconfinement is implemented by dissolving the newly produced hadrons into the massive colored quarks / antiquarks and mean - field energy from the dqpm . * within the qgp phase , the partons ( quarks , antiquarks and gluons ) scatter and propagate in a self - generated mean - field potential .",
    "they are described as off - shell quasi - particles with temperature - dependent masses and widths , which are given by the dqpm . *",
    "the expansion of the system is associated to a decrease of the local energy density and , once the local energy density becomes close to or lower than @xmath21 , the massive colored off - shell quarks and antiquarks hadronize to colorless off - shell mesons and baryons .",
    "the hadronization process is defined by covariant transition rates and fulfills the energy - momentum and quantum number conservation in each event . * in the hadronic corona as well as in the late hadronic phase , the particles are still interacting and propagating .",
    "elastic and inelastic collisions between baryons , mesons and resonances are implemented in phsd and the corresponding backward reactions are included through detailed balance for all channels .",
    "we further note that the pure hadronic phase in phsd is equivalent to the hadron - strings dynamics ( hsd ) model @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the comparison between phsd and hsd calculations allows us to disentangle the role of the qgp phase in heavy - ion collisions . even at low center - of - mass energies ( @xmath22gev ) the phsd and",
    "the hsd results slightly differ due to the appearance of qgp droplets in central cells of the system , which are characterized by high baryon and energy densities .",
    "the phsd approach has been tested for different colliding systems ( p+p , p+a , a+a ) in a wide range of bombarding energy , from ags to lhc energies , and has been able to describe a large number of experimental observables , such as charged particle spectra , collective flow coefficients @xmath23 as well as electromagnetic probes such as photons and dileptons @xcite .",
    "more recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been also shown to provide a microscopic description of the maximum in the @xmath4 ratio in central nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the latter work we also found that the inclusion of csr in the hadronic sector via string decay is crucial in order to reproduce the strangeness enhancement at ags and lower sps energies .",
    "the string formation and decay represents the dominant particle production mechanism in nucleus - nucleus collisions for bombarding energies from @xmath24agev to @xmath25agev . in phsd ,",
    "the primary hard scatterings between nucleons are described by string formation and decay in the fritiof lund model @xcite .",
    "a string is an excited color - singlet state , which is composed of two string ends corresponding to the leading constituent quarks of the colliding hadrons and a color flux tube in between . as the string ends recede , virtual @xmath26 or @xmath27 pairs",
    "are produced in the uniform color field , causing the breaking of the string .",
    "finally , the string decays into mesons or baryon - antibaryon pairs with formation time @xmath18fm / c ( in the rest - frame of the string ) .",
    "+ in the string decay , the flavor of the produced quarks is determined via the schwinger formula @xcite , which defines the production probability of massive @xmath28 pairs with respect to light flavor production @xmath29 pairs : @xmath30 with @xmath31gev@xmath32 representing the string tension and @xmath33 denoting the constituent quark masses for strange and light quarks . for the constituent quark masses",
    "@xmath34gev and @xmath35gev in the vacuum , the production of strange quarks is suppressed by a factor of @xmath36 with respect to the light quarks , which is the default setting in the fritiof routines . the relative production factors in phsd / hsd have been readjusted in 1998 as follows @xcite : @xmath37 the probability ratio @xmath38 has been increased to @xmath39 at ags energies in order to correctly reproduce the strangeness yield for p+be collisions at ags energies @xcite . a smooth transition between the two values of @xmath38",
    "is ensured by a linear interpolation as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath40 . + a further ingredient to fix the rapidity distribution for the newly produced hadrons is the fraction of energy and momentum that they acquire from the decaying string .",
    "this is defined by the fragmentation function @xmath41 , which is the probability distribution for a hadron with transverse mass @xmath42 to be produced with an energy - momentum fraction @xmath43 from the fragmenting string : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46gev@xmath47 as reliable settings for p+p and p+a collisions . as becomes evident from eq .",
    "( [ frag0 ] ) the meson @xmath42-scaling from string decay is included by default .      in ref .",
    "@xcite the phsd has been extended to include csr in the string decay in a hadronic environment of finite baryon and meson density .",
    "here we recall the main aspect of this extension which is based on the hellman - feynman theorem for the scalar quark condensate @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a linear decrease of the scalar quark condensate @xmath48  which is nonvanishing in the vacuum due to a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry  is expected with baryon density @xmath49 towards a chiral symmetric phase characterized by @xmath50 0 @xcite .",
    "this decrease of the scalar quark condensate is expected also to lead to a change of the hadron properties with density and temperature , i.e. in a chirally restored phase the vector and axial vector currents should become equal @xcite ; the latter implies that e.g. the @xmath13 and @xmath14 spectral functions should become identical ( as addressed above in the context of dilepton production ) .",
    "since the scalar quark condensate @xmath51 is not a direct observable , its manifestations should also be found indirectly in different hadronic abundancies and spectra or particle ratios like @xmath4 , @xmath52 etc . as advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in leading order",
    "the scalar quark condensate @xmath10 can be evaluated in a dynamical calculation as follows @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 stands for the @xmath55-commutator of the relevant mesons @xmath56 , @xmath57 represents the vacuum condensate , @xmath58mev is the pion - nucleon @xmath2-term and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the pion decay constant and pion mass , respectively .",
    "note , however , that the value of @xmath61 is not so accurately known ; a recent analysis points towards a larger value of @xmath62 mev @xcite while actual lqcd results @xcite suggest a substantially lower value .",
    "accordingly , our following calculations - based on @xmath63 mev - have to be taken with some care although in some sense it represents a world average ( cf",
    ". fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to the light quark content , the @xmath2-term for hyperons is decreased by a factor of 2/3 for @xmath64 and @xmath2 hyperons and by a factor of 1/3 for @xmath65 baryons .",
    "furthermore , for mesons made out of light quarks and antiquarks , we use @xmath66 , whereas for mesons with a strange ( antistrange ) quark we consider @xmath67 .",
    "we mention here that improved results for the sigma - commutator for kaons can be obtained from chiral perturbation theory as in ref . @xcite and",
    "alternative assumptions for non - pseudoscalar mesons can be employed as e.g. suggested by cohen et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite . in view of the subleading contributions of these mesons to the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ scalar_condensate ] ) we keep the simple estimates noted above for our present study and look forward to a clarification of the present tension between the results from lqcd and dispersive approaches @xcite .    in eq .",

    "we defer a discussion on the uncertainties of our results to the following section [ eos ] .",

    "this feature can be easily explained looking at the definition of the ratio @xmath104 ( [ scalar_condensate ] ) : at @xmath106 , there are no thermal mesons , thus the last term of the relation vanishes and the ratio is entirely fixed by the scalar density @xmath68 ; hence , higher values of @xmath68 correspond to lower values of @xmath104 .",

    "note , however , that very peripheral reactions are not considered for @xmath201 50 . at @xmath177agev the interaction volume of the two colliding nuclei reaches high energy densities such that practically all central cells are influenced by the csr mechanism independently of the centrality of the collision .",
    "future heavy - ion collision experiments are expected to shed further light on the dynamics of the chiral symmetry restoration by exploring these kind of additional observables .",
    "the aim of this section is to study which parts of the phase diagram in the ( @xmath8)-plane are probed by heavy - ion collisions with special focus on the strangeness production . in general",
    "it is not straight forward ( or even impossible ) to connect non - equilibrium dynamics from microscopic transport studies to macroscopic equilibrium properties like temperature and chemical potentials . for this purpose",
    "one needs the exact qcd - equation of state that relates the energy and the conserved charges to temperature and the chemical potentials of an equilibrated system .",
    "as long as lattice calculations at finite chemical potential are prevented by the sign - problem one has to rely on effective models , making a study of the phase diagram model dependent .",
    "another issue is the question if the system reaches a local equilibrium during the heavy - ion collision .",
    "a common method to decide on kinetic equilibration is the pressure equilibration of the energy momentum tensor @xmath203 . in the local rest - frame it takes the form @xmath204 where @xmath103 is the energy density and @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 are the pressure components in @xmath43- , @xmath208- and @xmath209-direction . in the center of the collision",
    "they are often labeled as @xmath210 and @xmath211 , when the beam is in the @xmath209-direction . due to the initial asymmetry of the collision",
    "the longitudinal and the transverse pressure differ significantly .",
    "a necessary requirement for kinetic equilibrium is the coincidence of the pressure components @xmath212 .",
    "the behavior of the pressure components in the central region of the collision zone has been studied in ref .",

    "it was found that the pressure equilibrates at @xmath213fm / c after the initial impact of central au+au collisions at ags energies .",
    "additionally , a good agreement between the energy spectra of different hadron species with the predictions of statistical models was found at this time .",
    "this indicates that one can indeed find an equilibrated system at ags energies for times larger than @xmath115 10 fm / c . to fix points in the ( @xmath8)-plane we have to determine the temperature @xmath214 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath9 of the medium in the expanding fireball",
    "this is usually done by comparing the energy density and the conserved charges in the local cell to the corresponding equation of state @xcite . for hadronic matter",
    "it is common to use a hadron - resonance gas equation of state .",
    "however , it is unclear which hadronic resonances should be included in such a model .",
    "we will therefore determine a temperature @xmath214 and a baryon chemical potential @xmath9 from the energy density and particle density of nucleons and pions which are directly accessible within our transport simulations . instead of examining the whole fireball we will focus on local cells where strangeness is produced ; these cells may be close to thermal equilibrium ( at late times ) or out - of equilibrium ( at early times ) .",
    "the focus on local cells with strangeness production excludes free streaming cells as well as everything that happens after chemical freeze - out .",
    "whenever a new @xmath215-pair is produced in the hadronic medium we take the nucleon and pion energy densities @xmath216 and @xmath217 and determine the temperature @xmath214 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath9 using the expressions for a noninteracting hadron gas ( in equilibrium ) : @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the energy of the respective particle and @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the degeneracy factors of pions and nucleons . by additionally evaluating the densities @xmath222 and @xmath223 we can check if the local cell is in approximate thermal equilibrium or not . in practical terms",

    "it is important to discuss how these occupancies in the phase diagram relate to the real qcd - phase diagram . due to",
    "the model dependent eos the extracted temperatures and chemical potentials do not represent the real ones for qcd .",
    "we recall that the phsd transport approach uses a critical energy density of @xmath244gev/@xmath20 to distinguish between a hadronic and a partonic medium .",
    "if the local energy density is above this threshold the hadrons dissolve into quarks .",
    "the critical energy density @xmath21 marks the largest energy density a hadronic system can reach in our simulations .",
    "when compared to recent lattice results from the wuppertal - budapest collaboration @xcite at @xmath245 this translates to a temperature of around @xmath246mev . on the other side",
    "the model used to extract the temperature and chemical potential is based on the hadron resonance gas with a reduced number of degrees - of - freedom .",
    "we mention that a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) , that contains all the hadronic particles included in phsd , reaches the critical energy density at a temperature @xmath247mev .",
    "this indicates that the temperatures shown in figs .",
    "[ pic : pd_vs_time ] and [ pic : pd_vs_energy ] are too large compared to full qcd . as a rough guide one should divide the temperatures in these figures by a factor @xmath115 1.1 in order to obtain an estimate closer to full qcd .",
    "for the baryon chemical potential we note that the baryon number susceptibilities @xmath248 of the hrg are smaller than the lattice results @xcite .",
    "this implies the corresponding baryon densities , in first order given by @xmath249 , exceed the hrg densities , thus overestimating the extracted baryon chemical potentials @xmath9 in comparison to full qcd .",
    "admittedly we can not give a definite rescaling for finite chemical potentials , nevertheless , the general trend should be the same in the whole @xmath250 -plane shifting the probed area to smaller temperatures and chemical potentials .",
    "nevertheless , it becomes apparent from fig .",
    "[ pic : pd_vs_energy ] that it will be very hard to identify a critical point in the ( @xmath8)-plane experimentally since the spread in @xmath214 and @xmath9 is very large at all bombarding energies of interest .",
    "in this work we have analyzed the effects of chiral symmetry restoration ( csr ) on observables from heavy - ion collisions in the energy range @xmath15gev .",
    "our results have been obtained within the parton - hadron - string dynamics transport approach @xcite , where essential aspects of csr have been incorporated in the schwinger mechanism for the string decay @xcite .",
    "since the phsd approach includes both hadronic and partonic degrees - of - freedom and has been tested in a wide energy regime , it represents a powerful tool to study nucleus - nucleus collisions on a microscopic basis .",
    "the csr , as implemented in phsd , affects only the hadronic particle production and it does not imply modifications in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase .",
    "we have found that csr induces an enhancement of the strange quark fraction @xmath38 produced via the string decay , while we predict no sensible changes in the diquark production and accordingly in baryon - antibaryon production .",
    "the @xmath142 ratio , as defined by the schwinger formula ( [ schwinger - formula ] ) , increases as a function of the energy density due to csr and this is reflected in an enhancement of the strange particle abundances with respect to the non - strange ones .",
    "this has been observed explicitly in the particle spectra at ags and lower sps energies ( @xmath251 to 30agev ) . on the other hand , at top sps energies ( e.g. @xmath171agev ) the results from phsd with and without csr merge , since the dynamics of the system is dominated by the qgp phase where csr does not play a significant role .",
    "we found that the transverse mass spectra are only slightly modified by the inclusion of the csr .",
    "in fact , the csr mechanism acts predominantly on the chemistry and not on the kinematics of the string decays .",
    "we stress that our phsd calculations provide a microscopic interpretation of the `` horn '' structure in the excitation function of the @xmath4 ratio in central au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions .",
    "the steep rise of this ratio at ags energies is associated to csr , while the drop at higher sps energies is due to the appearance of the qgp phase in an increasing volume of the interaction region .",
    "we have found an analogous energy dependence for the @xmath187 ratio , while the excitation function of the @xmath186 ratio does not show any explicit peak .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the sensitivity of our results on the parametrizations for the nuclear equation of state .",
    "in fact , we adopted the non - linear @xmath1 model to compute the baryon scalar density @xmath68 in the space - time cells of the system .",
    "the scalar density @xmath68 is an essential ingredient of the csr mechanism within the phsd and it is needed for the calculation of the scalar quark condensate in the nuclear medium ( [ scalar_condensate ] ) .",
    "there is a moderate sensitivity of the particle ratios and of the rapidity spectra at ags and lower sps energies to the nuclear eos , in particular the nl1 parameter set gives a stronger strangeness enhancement relative to the nl3 set .",
    "in general , the phsd results obtained with the inclusion of csr are in a good agreement with the available data for all observables analyzed , while calculations without csr fail substantially .",
    "we have investigated also different sizes of the colliding ions ( @xmath194au , @xmath195ca and @xmath196c ) and computed the strange to non - strange particle ratios for these configurations with and without csr .",
    "it is found that the `` horn '' feature in the @xmath4 ratio appears only for larger system sizes , i.e. au+au and ca+ca , while the `` horn '' disappears in case of c+c collisions .",
    "the @xmath187 excitation function maintains the peak - structure as we have observed in case of au+au collisions also for smaller sizes of the system .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the strange particle abundances in au+au collisions at @xmath252agev as a function of the number of participants in the collision .",
    "as mentioned above , when including csr in the phsd calculations we obtain an increase of the strange particle yields with respect to the results from phsd without csr and this feature is valid in case of central collisions as well as moderate peripheral collisions .",
    "more experimental observations are needed to extract information about the centrality and system size dependence of the csr .",
    "we also have addressed the question whether the strangeness production in hic occurs in thermodynamical equilibrium or not and have found that strange particles are produced dominantly at the early stages of the collisions , when the system is not in thermal and chemical equilibrium . at ags energies",
    "only a few percent of the total strangeness production happens in approximate local thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "with decreasing bombarding energy lower temperatures and higher baryon chemical potentials are reached , however , the spread in @xmath214 and @xmath9 is very large such that a search for a critical point in the phase diagram becomes very difficult experimentally .    in conclusion ,",
    "our microscopic studies support the idea that csr occurs in hadronic systems with high temperatures and densities before the deconfinement phase transition takes over .",
    "we suggest that the strange particle spectra and yields are suitable signatures to study the properties of csr in hics in future also as a function of system size and centrality .",
