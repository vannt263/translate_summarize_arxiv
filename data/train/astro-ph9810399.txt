    "the polarization characteristics of a pulsar yield clues to its magnetic geometry and emission mechanism . many pulse profiles are highly linearly polarized and have a clear position - angle swing across part or all of the period . for slow pulsars",
    ", this position - angle swing often follows the characteristic s - shaped curve of the `` rotating vector model '' ( rvm ) introduced by radhakrishnan and cooke ( 1969 ) . in this description ,",
    "the magnetic dipole axis is inclined at an angle @xmath0 from the spin axis , and makes angle @xmath1 with the line of sight from earth .",
    "the angle of between the line of sight and the pulsar spin axis is @xmath2 .",
    "the position angle @xmath3 can then be written as a function of pulse phase @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant offset and @xmath7 is the phase of steepest position - angle swing , given by : @xmath8    the rotating vector model , along with the observed linear and circular polarization properties of many pulse profiles , has led to the formulation of successful phenomenological classification schemes for slow pulsars based on pulse morphology and polarimetry ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to date",
    ", limited polarimetric studies of the faster millisecond pulsars ( msps ) have suggested that their pulse components do not fit easily into these classification schemes , and frequently have more complex polarimetric profiles than slow pulsars ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we present polarization profiles for several millisecond pulsars .",
    "these profiles represent the first polarimetric observations of many of these pulsars , and for others , the first low - frequency polarization profiles .",
    "there is considerable overlap between the present set of pulsars and those studied by xilouris ( 1998 ) at 1410mhz using the 100 m telescope at effelsberg , germany ; our study provides a needed complement to these higher - frequency observations .",
    "recently , sallmen ( 1998 ) has studied several of the pulsars presented here , conducting observations at the national radio astronomy observatory , green bank , w.v . and effelsberg , germany .",
    "where applicable , we compare our results to these studies .",
    "observations were made using the 76-m telescope at the nuffield radio astronomy laboratories , jodrell bank , u.k . , between 1997 january and 1997 july .",
    "data were obtained at 410mhz , 610mhz , and 1414mhz , with observing bandwidths of 5mhz at 410mhz and 610mhz , and 10mhz at 1414mhz .",
    "all data were acquired with the princeton mark  iv observing system .",
    "this instrument implements the coherent dispersion removal technique described by hankins and rickett ( 1975 ) . a fast analog - to - digital converter samples quadrature components of the received telescope voltages in the two orthogonal circular polarization channels , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , employing either 2-bit sampling across 10mhz of bandwidth , or 4-bit sampling across 5mhz .",
    "the data are stored on magnetic tape for off - line processing .",
    "coherent dedispersion is performed in software , using a special - purpose parallel processor . the data stream is typically split into either two or four sub - bands during processing .",
    "the self- and cross - products @xmath11 , @xmath12 , re(@xmath13 ) and im(@xmath13 ) are formed from the dedispersed time - series in each sub - band , then folded modulo the predicted topocentric pulse period .",
    "the full set of stokes parameters are readily formed from these products . a complete description of the instrument , along with preliminary polarimetric results , has been published elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "fluxes were calibrated using an injected noise signal , the strength of which was determined by comparison with a bright continuum source of known flux .",
    "the reference sources used varied between observing sessions , but were drawn from the following list : 3c48 , with an assumed flux of 15.8jy at 1414mhz ; 3c123 , with an assumed flux of 117.6jy at 410mhz , 91.8jy at 610mhz , and 48.4jy at 1414mhz ; 3c147 , with an assumed flux of 22.3jy at 1414mhz ; and 3c353 , with an assumed flux of 129.4jy at 410mhz .",
    "the uncertainties in the calibration are approximately 10% .",
    "the noise calibrator was switched on and off at ( typically ) 3-minute intervals throughout each 30-minute observation .",
    "the flux in the @xmath12 channel was determined using the differences in the off - pulse baseline and the strength of the noise calibrator .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath11 channel was found to be more variable across the observing bandwidth , making a similar calculation less reliable for this channel . instead , the @xmath11 calibration factor was calculated so that the ratio of the off - pulse baselines in @xmath11 and @xmath12 was equal to the ratio of the known total system temperatures , i.e. , the receiver temperatures corrected for telescope elevation angle and sky temperature in the direction of the pulsar ( @xmath14 ) . the square root of the product of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 calibration factors was used to calibrate the cross - product terms .",
    "the four stokes parameters , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , were obtained from the calibrated products .",
    "a small dc bias was removed from the cross - terms , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; these parameters were then corrected for the parallactic rotation of the feed during tracking using the procedure outlined by rankin ( 1975 ) .",
    "the corrected terms , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , yielded the linearly polarized power @xmath21 and the source position angle @xmath22 .",
    "we followed the recommendation of damour and taylor ( 1992 ) in taking the angle @xmath3 to increase clockwise on the sky .",
    "a position - angle offset was fitted out between sub - bands and between profiles taken on different days .",
    "in order to monitor the quality of our polarimetry and flux calibration , we frequently observed the strong , slow pulsar b1929@xmath2310 .",
    "this pulsar has been previously studied by several different observers ( @xcite ) ; it is known to have high linear polarization and very little circular intensity .",
    "an error in our calibration procedure would therefore be immediately apparent in its polarization profile .",
    "our profiles at 410mhz , 610mhz , and 1414mhz are presented in figures  [ fig : f1929](a)-[fig : f1929](c ) ; they agree well with those reported in the literature .",
    "we therefore consider our calibration procedure correct to within the estimated 10% uncertainty in the injected noise levels .",
    "we note , however , that at 410mhz the circular intensity profile appears similar to the total power in shape , suggesting a small miscalibration in @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the parameters derived from our rvm fits to the position angle swing of this pulsar are given in table  [ tab:1929 ] .    in principle , observations of b1929@xmath2310 can be used to correct for any ellipticity or non - orthogonality in the nominally circular antenna feeds ( @xcite ) .",
    "such imperfections result in mixing of , respectively , linear power into circular and total intensity into linear , with the coupling varying sinusoidally as a function of the incident position angle .",
    "gould ( 1994 ) finds that non - orthogonality in the 610mhz feeds at jodrell bank affects the linear intensity at the level of a few percent ; an effect of this magnitude would not be readily separable from calibration effects in our data .    in our 610mhz and",
    "1414mhz profiles for b1929@xmath2310 , the position angle exhibits a @xmath24 shift near the leading edge of the main pulse .",
    "such shifts are common to many pulsar profiles .",
    "they are accompanied by a null in the linear polarization intensity , and can be explained by a switch between two competing orthogonal emission modes ( @xcite ) .",
    "these orthogonal mode changes can be removed before fitting an rvm model to the position angle data .",
    "we now present the profiles of the millisecond pulsars observed at jodrell bank , and discuss the more important measurements .",
    "table  [ tab : ppdot ] gives the period , period derivative , magnetic field and characteristic age for each pulsar observed , and table  [ tab : res ] lists the time resolutions and integration times for each of the displayed profiles .",
    "table  [ tab : pol ] lists the @xmath25 and @xmath26 widths , the effective pulse width , defined as the area under the pulse profile divided by the peak height , along with the average magnitudes of the linear and circular intensities and mean fluxes for each of the pulsars in our study .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 pulse widths are obtained by linear interpolation of the profiles , yielding errors the size of a few phase bins .",
    "the calibration uncertainties lead to errors of approximately @xmath25 in the average linear and circular intensities and fluxes . for those pulsars for which a rotating vector model fit was possible ,",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : rvm ] .",
    "psr  j0218@xmath234232 was initially discovered in a survey for steep - spectrum point sources ; the pulsed emission is on average only one - half the flux observed from the point source ( @xcite ) .",
    "a significant level of unpulsed emission is extremely unusual in radio pulsars .",
    "when considered with the fact that there are pulsed components across the profile , this emission suggests that the pulsar is an aligned rotator with a broad beam .",
    "our rvm fits support the classification as a nearly aligned rotator , with magnetic inclinations consistent with @xmath27 at both 410 and 610mhz .",
    "it should be noted that if the continuum emission is strongly polarized , this pedestal could affect our measurement of the position angle of the pulsed component .",
    "the impact parameters from our rvm fits have very large uncertainties , but are consistent with a line - of - sight inclination of @xmath24 , possible if the pulsar beam is extremely broad .",
    "this binary system is therefore a candidate for the measurement of shapiro delay , an effect seen in only one neutron - star  white - dwarf system to date ( @xcite ) .      at both observing frequencies a large fraction of circularly polarized power is evident in the main pulse but not in the two precursors .",
    "there is significant linear polarization in the main pulse , but the position angle does not follow a sweep consistent with the rvm .",
    "our profiles are consistent with those reported by backer at 780mhz ( @xcite ) and sallmen at 575mhz ( @xcite )",
    ". observations at 21 cm at bonn ( @xcite ) and green bank ( @xcite ) find a very different and nearly completely unpolarized pulse profile : what we label as the main pulse becomes a trailing pulse , while the second , larger , precursor becomes dominant .",
    "thus the high - frequency profile is similar to a triple pulse .",
    "the lack of profile development between 410 and 780mhz and the completely different morphology at 1400mhz imply a frequency development very different from that predicted by the empirical model .",
    "this pulsar has a white - dwarf companion of minimum mass @xmath29 , higher than that of most white - dwarf pulsar companions , but still far below the mass of a neutron star .",
    "as helium flash occurs at stellar core masses above @xmath29 ( e.g. , kippenhahn and weigert 1990 ) , the companion is likely to be a carbon - oxygen white dwarf .",
    "the system is classified as being one of the few `` intermediate - mass binary pulsars ( imbps ) '' ; its evolutionary history is thought to have been different from that of lower - mass systems . in particular , the mass accretion history may have been different from that seen in the low - mass systems , possibly leading to difference in the observed emission geometry .",
    "this pulsar exhibits very low levels of polarization , with a relatively flat position - angle swing .",
    "camilo ( 1996 ) report that the pulse shape does not change between 370mhz and 1.4ghz , and our results support this finding . for slow pulsars",
    "it is common for the spacing between pulse components to decrease with increasing frequency ; this pulsar clearly does not follow the same frequency evolution .",
    "this pulsar has a white dwarf companion for which the radial velocity is measured ; the mass ratio resulting from the observations is @xmath30 ( @xcite ) . assuming a neutron - star mass of @xmath31 , the timing mass function yields an expected orbital inclination angle of @xmath32 . from evolutionary arguments ( e.g. , bhattacharya and van den heuvel 1991 )",
    ", the spin axis is likely to be nearly aligned with the orbital angular momentum axis .",
    "the large width of the pulse profile and the overall similarity of the position angle swing to that of psr  j0218 + 4232 lead us to expect , also in this case , a nearly - aligned rotator with a wide beam and large impact parameter .",
    "the 610-mhz profile exhibits multiple components across the period , as well as strong linear and moderate circular polarization .",
    "similar results are found at 575mhz by sallmen ( 1998 ) .",
    "xilouris ( 1998 ) point out that equal position angle slopes , though with opposite sign , for the main pulse and interpulse would argue for the classification of the pulsar as an orthogonal rotator .",
    "unfortunately , while there is a small slope in the main pulse position - angle swing , the swing in the interpulse region is nearly flat , making this test impractical .",
    "our rvm fits to the shallow position - angle swing indicate that the magnetic inclination is instead very close to @xmath27 , supporting the classification as an aligned rotator .",
    "the impact parameter is not well - determined .",
    "psr  j1022@xmath231001 is another imbp , with a companion mass of approximately @xmath33 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the profile is narrow and highly polarized at all frequencies .",
    "it is difficult to comment on the frequency evolution of the profile , as it is known to exhibit variations , on the time - scale of tens of minutes , in which the leading component becomes larger or smaller than the apparently more stable trailing component ( @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest linear polarization is associated with the trailing component . despite the roughly s - shaped position - angle swing ,",
    "the rvm model is not a very good fit except at 1414mhz , where we find an impact parameter of @xmath34 , consistent with the result reported in xilouris ( 1998 ) .",
    "the narrow pulse makes it difficult to constrain the magnetic inclination and hence the line - of - sight angle @xmath35 .",
    "it appears that both @xmath0 and @xmath35 are approximately @xmath24 ; the direction of the off - pulse rvm swing is determined by whether @xmath35 falls above or below @xmath24 .    at the two lower observing frequencies",
    ", there appears to be a transition in the shape of the position - angle swing , associated with a dip between two peaks of the linear polarization .",
    "this `` notch '' makes it difficult to fit a single rvm model to the data . at 610mhz",
    ", we obtain a possible fit with impact parameter @xmath36 , within error of the value obtained at 1414mhz .      the profiles for this pulsar show considerable frequency development .",
    "the wider pulse shape at 410mhz is a change in morphology ; it is not consistent with broadening due to scattering by the interstellar medium .",
    "there is some circular polarization at all frequencies , indicative of a central core component .",
    "the strong linear intensity is accompanied by a shallow position angle curve with multiple orthogonal mode changes .",
    "similar results at 575mhz and 1410mhz are found by sallmen ( 1998 ) .      at our observing frequency of 610mhz ,",
    "the linear polarization is rather weak .",
    "our data were collected on three different days ; we find some evidence for mode - changing in the total intensity as reported by xilouris ( 1998 ) and kramer ( 1998 ) . the sense - reversing circular intensity also agrees with these results , supporting the hypothesis of a central core profile component .",
    "psr  b1744@xmath2824a , in the globular cluster terzan 5 , is a rare eclipsing pulsar . in figure",
    "[ fig : f1744](b ) we present the profile resulting from 330 minutes of observations acquired on four separate days and at a wide range of orbital phases ; these averaged data yield a maximum linear polarization of 9% .",
    "our observations do not support the result of xilouris ( 1998 ) , who found a linear polarization fraction of 60% .",
    "the data of xilouris ( 1998 ) were taken during a single observing session ( @xcite ) ; although we saw no similar results in our four days observations , it is possible that the linear polarization of 1744 - 24 is variable .",
    "the pulse profile is complex , with multiple components and strong linear intensity in at least two components .",
    "the position angle is nearly flat across the individual components , though there are offsets between components which are not consistent with orthogonal mode changes .",
    "we find a possible rvm fit for the position - angle swing , with @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "our result is consistent with the estimate of @xmath39 , @xmath40 given in backer and sallmen ( 1997 ) , though the phase of steepest swing is offset by roughly @xmath41 .",
    "however , when both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are near @xmath42 , the rvm curve is nearly symmetric , thus this discrepancy is not as important as it may seem .",
    "we find no evidence in our 610mhz data for mode - changing as described in backer and sallmen ( 1997 ) ; however , backer and sallmen found no such mode - changes below 1395mhz .",
    "there is some frequency evolution apparent in the presented profiles : a trailing component becomes stronger at 610mhz than at 410mhz , and there is a reduction in the intensities of both linear and circular polarizations .",
    "the strong circular polarization is indicative of a core component , and the small trailer may be a conal outrider .",
    "taken together , the polarization and the frequency development suggest that this msp may fit into the classification scheme based on slower pulsars .",
    "the position angle shows orthogonal mode switching at both frequencies .",
    "this isolated object was the first millisecond pulsar discovered ( @xcite ) , and it is still the fastest known .",
    "its polarimetric properties have previously been studied at multiple frequencies ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results agree well with those published earlier , and offer considerable information about the position angle behavior at the leading edge of the main pulse at 1414mhz .",
    "the main - pulse peak linear polarization decreases from 75% at 610mhz to 49% at 1414mhz ; the position angle is nearly flat across both the main pulse and the interpulse , with evidence for orthogonal mode changes at the leading edge of the main pulse at 1414mhz and of both components at 610mhz . both components",
    "broaden as a result of scattering at lower frequencies . as the main pulse and interpulse are separated by nearly @xmath41 of phase , it is sensible to interpret the emission as coming from an orthogonal rotator . as mentioned in thorsett and stinebring ( 1990 ) ,",
    "the observed pulse widths are much narrower than those predicted by the empirical relation between the spin period and magnetic inclination ( @xcite ) .",
    "the profile of this imbp contains at least three components , with bridged emission between the two strongest .",
    "there is considerable frequency evolution : the main pulse component strengthens relative to the others at higher frequencies . along with the sense - reversing circular polarization in the last component , this suggests that the last component is core emission , while the `` main pulse '' is conal .",
    "however , it is not clear how to interpret the precursor in this picture .",
    "the linear intensity is strongest at low frequencies , and the accompanying position - angle swing is extremely complex , with multiple orthogonal mode changes . even with the mode changes subtracted , the rvm is not a good fit to the 410mhz or 610mhz profiles . at 1414mhz , we find that the linear intensity drops to very low levels .",
    "in contrast , xilouris ( 1998 ) present a profile with reasonably strong linear polarization and a shallow position - angle swing .",
    "sallmen ( 1998 ) reports a similar profile ( strong linear intensity , shallow position - angle swing ) derived from a single observation at 820mhz at green bank .",
    "it seems therefore that the linear emission is highly variable , further challenging models of the pulsar emission mechanisms .",
    "millisecond pulsars share a number of polarization characteristics with slow pulsars ; in particular , high degrees of linear and circular polarization , well - defined position - angle swings , and orthogonal mode switching appear to be common in both classes .",
    "however , very few msps have profiles which evolve following the predictions of the slow - pulsar phenomenological model or have position - angle swings which fit the rotating vector model .",
    "our results add to the evidence that recycled pulsars have more complex polarimetric properties than younger pulsars .",
