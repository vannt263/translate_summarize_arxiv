    "the study of possible modifications of hadron properties in the nuclear medium is one of the central problems of contemporary nuclear physics . in principle , these and related phenomena in nuclear physics are governed by the fundamental theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , although qcd has been very successful in explaining a large class of hadronic processes at high energy and large momentum transfer , typical nuclear phenomena at lower energies can not be derived from qcd with the theoretical tools presently available .",
    "the difficulty of using qcd for phenomena at the nuclear scale is related to the nonperturbative nature of these . due to the asymptotic freedom property of qcd , high energy processes are calculable by perturbative techniques in the quark - gluon coupling constant . on the other hand ,",
    "since there are no reliable systematic approximation schemes in field theory for performing nonperturbative calculations , the construction of models is an important aspect of low energy qcd . while there is considerable optimism that eventually one will be able to solve qcd numerically on the lattice using supercomputers , the development of analytical approximation methods are in urgent need to make contact with the wealth of data on nonperturbative phenomena , presently available , or that will be available when the new experimental facilities under construction start operating .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion  @xcite is an example of a method recently developed with the aim of studying nonperturbative phenomena in field theory .",
    "the idea of the @xmath0 expansion is to perturb the original theory by the introduction of an artificial expansion parameter @xmath0 , absent in the original theory .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is introduced in such a way that it interpolates between the theory one wants to solve and another theory that one knows how to solve .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion can be formulated in two different forms , the logarithmic @xmath0 expansion  @xcite and the linear @xmath0 expansion  @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the linear form .",
    "specifically , let @xmath1 be the action of the theory one wants to solve , and @xmath2 the action of the soluble theory .",
    "then , the interpolating action @xmath3 is defined as s()=(1-)s_0 + s , [ sdelta ] so that @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the next step involves the evaluation of desired physical quantities as a perturbation series in powers of @xmath0 , which is then set equal to @xmath6 at the end .",
    "a crucial aspect of the method is the recognition that @xmath2 involves arbitrary unknown ( dimensionful and/or dimensionless ) parameters .",
    "if one were able to solve the new theory to all orders in @xmath0 , the unknown parameters would not play any role , since no physical observable would depend on them .",
    "however , since we will be able to solve the interpolated theory only to a finite order in @xmath0 , there will remain a residual dependence of the results on the parameters of @xmath2 .",
    "these arbitrary parameters must therefore be determined according to some criterion and in fact there are many ways in which this can be done  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "one physically appealing way to fix the unknown parameters , which is the one adopted here , is the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) introduced in ref .",
    "this principle amounts to the requirement that physical quantities should be at least locally independent of the parameters . in the original applications of the method ,",
    "the unknown parameters were set to be equal to unity .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion , together with the criterion of the pms of physical observables , is known as the _ optimized _",
    "expansion_. the convergence of the optimized @xmath0 expansion has been proved in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the different forms of the @xmath0 expansion have been successfully applied to many different problems in quantum mechanics @xcite , particle theory  @xcite , statistical physics  @xcite and lattice field theory  @xcite .",
    "motivated by these successes , in this paper we investigate the possibility of employing the linear @xmath0 expansion to study medium effects in hadron and nuclear physics using typical field theoretic models . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the use of the @xmath0 expansion in the study of density effects on the chiral symmetry breaking in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "the pms criterion for the typical chiral quantities is applied following previous experience with the method .",
    "we also investigate an alternative way of fixing the parameters by applying the pms to the energy density of the system . in section  [ sec : walecka ] we consider the walecka model and study the effective nucleon mass in nuclear matter .",
    "both problems can be treated by obtaining the propagators of the fields involved .",
    "traditionally , the propagators are obtained in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation . in the case of the njl model",
    "this approximation amounts to neglecting the corrections to the four - point vertex . in the walecka model ,",
    "the hf approximation consists in obtaining self- consistently the nucleon propagator with bare meson propagators , and neglecting corrections to the meson - nucleon vertices .",
    "an additional approximation in the walecka model is the neglection of vacuum effects in the nucleon propagator . with the purpose of comparing the @xmath0 expansion method with the traditional hf approximation",
    ", we also neglect vertex corrections in both models , and neglect the vacuum in the walecka model .",
    "conclusions and discussions of the perspectives for future calculations appear in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the limit of zero current quark masses , the two - flavor lagrangian density of the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite is given by _",
    "njl =    represent the doublet of @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks .",

    ". the quark condensate for a given flavor is given by = -i , [ qbq ] where the trace is over spinor and color indices .",
    "the pion decay constant can be evaluated using the pagels - stokar  @xcite formula : if_q_^ab = g_qq , [ fpi ] where the trace now is over spinor , flavor and color indices .",
    "the quark - pion coupling is obtained from the goldberger - treiman relation .    in order to calculate these quantities",
    "one needs the quark propagator @xmath16 , which can be obtained using dyson s equation .",

    "also in this case , despite numerical imprecisions , the exchange corrections coincide with the usual hartree - fock solution , as can be seen in figure  7 . the behavior of @xmath90 as a function of the fermi momentum at this order does not show any noticeable difference as compared with the zeroth order results .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure  8 the behavior of @xmath12 as a function of @xmath21 obtained with the application of the pms to the full second order energy density ( dashed line ) is rather different from the one obtained when only the direct term is taken into account ( solid line ) .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that this different behavior does not manifest itself either in the values of @xmath90 or of the binding energy .",
    "this is because the energy density @xmath92 is a very flat function of @xmath12 , as can be seen in figure  9 , where the energy density is shown for @xmath93 @xmath56 .",
    "recall that if one had an exact solution , the energy density would be independent of @xmath12 .",
    "the solid line is obtained without the inclusion of the exchange term ( the pms solution in this case is given by @xmath94 ) and the dashed line gives the full second order density energy ( the pms solution is @xmath95 ) .",
    "this stability in the value of the energy density as a function of @xmath12 is very desirable and guarantees that even big changes in the value of @xmath12 will not affect physical quantities , as the binding energy for instance .",
    "in this paper we have utilized the optimized @xmath0 expansion to study medium effects in two commonly used models in hadron and nuclear physics : the njl model and the walecka model .",
    "we have investigated an alternative way of fixing the arbitrary parameters introduced by the @xmath0 expansion , by applying the pms to the energy density of the system .",
    "the most important and concrete conclusion we can draw from this work is that when applying the pms to the energy density of the njl model we reproduce , at any order , the familiar hartree - fock solution for the dynamically generated mass , in the approximation of neglecting vertex corrections . in the case of walecka model",
    ", we obtained results quantitatively similar to the ones of the usual hartree - fock approximation , although the analytical expressions are not evidently equivalent . if one neglects the exchange term in the energy density then clearly the mean - field solution is reproduced at any order .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , in the walecka model , the energy density is a very flat function of @xmath12 and this guarantees that the pms solution is indeed very stable .    on the basis of our results",
    ", we believe that the optimized @xmath0 expansion is a very robust nonperturbative approximation scheme . compared with the hartree - fock approximation ,",
    "the @xmath0 expansion is very economical because of its perturbative nature .",
    "once the reliability of the scheme has been established , one is ready to proceed to other interesting applications .",
    "these include vertex and , obviously , vacuum effects .",
    "the study of the vacuum in the walecka model is an important issue since one needs to know the limits of applicability of such model to high densities and/or temperatures before quark and gluon degrees of freedom have to be invoked .",
    "of course , one has to face renormalization problems when including the vacuum .",
    "renormalization in a hartree - fock scheme is very complicated  @xcite and one expects that this will be facilitated within the @xmath0 expansion method .",
