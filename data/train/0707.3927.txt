    "the crossover from bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state has drawn renewed interest in past few years due to rapid experimental progress in cold atomic two - component fermi gases .",
    "several experimental groups @xcite achieved the bec - bcs crossover in the two - component atomic fermi gases due to the magnetized feshbach resonance mechanism @xcite .",
    "the fermionic system becomes molecular bec for strong repulsive interaction and transform into the bcs states when the interaction is attractive . near the resonance , the zero energy @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 exceeds the interparticle spacing and the interparticle interactions are unitarity limited and universal .",
    "as in the case of bosonic clouds the frequencies of collective modes of fermi gases can be measured to high accuracy .",
    "the collective oscillation frequencies of a trapped gas can provide crucial information on the equation of state of the system .",
    "the experimental results on the collective frequencies of the lowest axial and radial breathing modes on ultra cold gases of @xmath2li across the feshbach resonance have also become available @xcite . since",
    "the weak - coupling bcs and unitarity limits are characterized by the same collective oscillation frequency , it is an interesting to find out another observable which makes a clear identification of these two regimes and to better characterize two kinds of superfluid .",
    "all the experiments of cold atomic fermi gases are done in a cigar shaped geometry in which the atomic density is inhomogeneous in the radial plane and quasi - homogeneous along the symmetry axis .",
    "the axial excitations of a cigar shaped fermi superfluid can be divided into two regimes : short wavelength excitations whose wavelength is much smaller than the axial size and long wavelength excitations whose wavelength is equal or larger than the axial size of the system . in the later case ,",
    "the axial excitations are discrete and the lowest axial breathing mode frequency has been measured @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the short wavelength axial phonons with different number of radial modes of a cigar - shaped fermi superfluid give rise to the multibranch spectrum @xcite .",
    "these are similar to the electromagnetic wave propagation in a wave guide . in the bcs side of the resonance , the low energy bosonic excitations ,",
    "apart from the gaped fermionic excitations , of the fermi superfluid are called multibranch bogoliubov - anderson ( ba ) modes . in the usual electronic superconductors ,",
    "the ba phonon mode is absent due to the long - range coulomb interaction .    in this work",
    "we find that the low energy multibranch modes in the bcs limit are different from that of in the unitarity limit , although discrete radial and axial mode frequencies are same due to the same exponent in the equation of state in the unitarity and bcs regimes .",
    "therefore , these multibranch modes can be used to identify and characterize the weak - coupling bcs and unitarity states .",
    "it is an interesting to study how one can probe such bosonic modes in the current available experimental setup .",
    "in fact , these multibranch low - energy bosonic modes could be observed by measuring dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) in a bragg scattering experiment .",
    "bragg spectroscopy of a trapped atomic system has proven to be an important tool for probing many bulk properties such as dynamic structure factor @xcite , verification of multibranch bogoliubov excitation spectrum in the usual atomic bec @xcite , correlation functions and momentum distributions of a phase fluctuating bose gases @xcite .",
    "there has been a suggestion of bragg scattering experiment to study the fermionic excitations at zero temperature @xcite as well as at temperature close to the critical temperature @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we also calculate dsf in the various regimes of the crossover , namely the weak - coupling bcs , unitarity and molecular bec regimes . in actual bragg scattering experiments",
    ", the measured response function is momentum transferred @xmath3 to the superfluid by the bragg pulses .",
    "the momentum transferred is directly related to the dynamic structure factor when time duration of the bragg pulses is long enough .",
    "therefore , we also study momentum transferred to the superfluid by the bragg pulses . in order to probe the multibranch nature of the modes , we also estimate required values of wave vector and time duration of the two - photon bragg pulses in the bragg scattering experiments .",
    "recently , there is a measurement of sound velocity along the crossover @xcite .",
    "the measured sound velocity do not match with the theoretical prediction in the molecular bec regime , however it matches very well in other regimes of the crossover @xcite .",
    "one can also estimate the sound velocity in the three different regimes along the crossover by measuring slope of the phonon mode .",
    "it may resolve the puzzle of mismatch of the measured sound velocity with that of the theoretical prediction in the molecular bec state .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we provide quantized hydrodynamic description of the fermi superfluid along the crossover . in section iii",
    ", we calculate the dynamic structure factor along the crossover . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the possible bragg scattering experiment in this system and present results of the momentum transferred to the system due to the bragg pulses .",
    "we also discuss a summary and conclusions in section v.",
    "we use hydrodynamic model with the weizsacker quantum pressure term to describe low - energy dynamics of a two - component fermi superfluid at zero temperature .",
    "this system can be well described by a time - dependent non - linear schrodinger equation as follows @xcite : [ sch ] i = [ - ^2 + v_ext(r , z ) + |(n ) ] ( * r*,t ) , where the non - linear term @xmath4 $ ] is the chemical potential in a uniform system and @xmath5 is the ground state energy per particle . here , @xmath6 is the mass of a fermi atom and @xmath7 is an external harmonic trap potential with @xmath8 .",
