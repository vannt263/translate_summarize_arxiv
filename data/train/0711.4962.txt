    "there are @xmath13 vector multiplets enumerated by @xmath14 , each containing the one - form gauge field @xmath15 ( with the two - form field strength @xmath16 ) , and the scalar @xmath17 .",
    "scalar fields @xmath18 , which are belonging to the hypermultiplet , can be gauge fixed and the convenient choice is given by @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",

    "condition @xmath23 is a condition of real special geometry .",

    "we are interested in extremal black hole solutions of the action obtained by combining ( [ l0susy ] ) and ( [ l1susy ] ) : and for the string tension @xmath34 . ]",
    "@xmath35    the action ( [ lsusy ] ) is quartic in derivatives and generally probably too complicated for finding complete analytical black hole solutions even in the simplest spherically symmetric case .",
    "but , if one is more modest and interested just in a near - horizon behavior ( which is enough to find the entropy ) of _ extremal _ black holes , there is a smart way to do the job - sen s entropy function formalism @xcite .    for five - dimensional spherically symmetric extremal black holes near - horizon geometry",
    "is expected to be @xmath36 , which has @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "if the lagrangian can be written in a manifestly diffeomorphism covariant and gauge invariant way , it is expected that near the horizon the complete background should respect this symmetry . in our case",
    "it means that near - horizon geometry should be given with @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath17 , @xmath41 , and @xmath12 are constants .",
    "all covariant derivatives are vanishing .",
    "if one defines @xmath42 where right hand side is evaluated on the background ( [ efhere ] ) , then equations of motion are equivalent to @xmath43 derivatives over electric field strengths @xmath40 are giving ( properly normalized ) electric charges : @xmath44 the entropy ( equal to the wald formula @xcite ) is given with @xmath45    it is immediately obvious that though the system ( [ seom ] ) , ( [ chgdef ] ) is algebraic , it is in generic case too complicated to be solved in direct manner , and that one should try to find some additional information .",
    "such additional information can be obtained from supersymmetry .",
    "it is known that there should be 1/2 bps black hole solutions , for which it was shown in @xcite that near the horizon supersymmetry is enhanced fully .",
    "this means that in this case we can put all variations in ( [ svar ] ) to zero , which one can use to express all unknowns in terms of one . to fix remaining unknown",
    "we just need one equation from ( [ seom ] ) , where the simplest is the one for @xmath12 .    typically one is interested in expressing the results in terms of charges , not field strengths , and this is achieved by using ( [ chgdef ] ) .",
    "one gets @xcite @xmath46 where we introduced scaled moduli @xmath47 .",
    "the entropy becomes @xmath48",
    "a virtue of this presentation is that if one is interested only in entropy , then it is enough to consider just ( [ mbareq ] ) and ( [ sentm ] ) , in which the sole effect of the higher derivative terms are just constant shifts of charges @xmath49 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that ( [ sentm ] ) agrees with the osv conjecture @xcite , after proper treatment of uplift from @xmath5 to @xmath2 is made .",
    "we shall be especially interested in the case when prepotential is of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a regular matrix with an inverse @xmath52 . in this case , which corresponds to @xmath53 11-dimensional compactifications , it is easy to show that the entropy of bps black holes is given with @xmath54 when additionally @xmath55 , @xmath56 , our action is equivalent to the ( consistently truncated ) tree - level effective action of heterotic string compactified on @xmath57 .",
    "one especially interesting ( and simple ) case is given with @xmath58-prepotential @xmath59 , which corresponds to heterotic string on @xmath60 .",
    "black hole solutions are caracterised by three integer charges usually denoted as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . and",
    "@xmath64 are momentum and winding number on @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the magnetic charge of antisymmetric @xmath67 field . ]",
    "constructed bps black hole solutions are physically acceptable for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the entropy is now @xmath70 it is remarkable that here non - bps solutions ( for almost all values of charges ) were also analytically constructed @xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 the entropy is @xmath74 properties of these non - bps solutions suggest possibility that they are descending from bps states either in @xmath75 and/or @xmath76 @xcite .    motivated by results from @xmath5",
    ", we have studied solutions when @xmath0-correction is given purely by gauss - bonnet density .",
    "we obtained that the entropy is different from the one following from @xmath0 susy action ( [ sek3 ] ) .",
    "this mismatch was not present in @xmath5 .",
    "in view of above results , it is interesting to perturbatively calculate entropy of large 5-dimensional 3-charge extremal black holes up to @xmath77-order using low energy effective action of heterotic string ( which is fully known only up to @xmath77-order ) .",
    "the main virtue is that this is a straightforward calculation giving unambiguous results . using entropy function formalism , and taking special care for non manifestly covariant gravitational chern - simons term ( using technique from @xcite )",
    ", we obtained for the entropy of bps black holes @xcite @xmath78 which is in agreement with the supersymmetric result , i.e. , with ( [ ssusyb ] ) after being expanded in @xmath79 .    for non - bps black holes we obtained the entropy @xmath80 which disagrees with both susy ( [ ssusyb ] ) and gauss - bonnet results already at @xmath4-order .",
    "instead , our result ( [ spertn ] ) suggests the following formula @xmath81 furthermore , if we take bps formula ( [ ssusyb ] ) for granted , then we have been able to show that @xmath82 term in the non - bps entropy formula ( [ spertn ] ) must be @xmath83 , which is again in agreement with the conjectured expression ( [ segzn ] ) .",
    "now , using ads / cft arguments , from ( [ spertb ] ) and ( [ spertn ] ) one infers that central charges satisfy @xmath84 , which is indeed what is expected @xcite .",
    "extremely interesting is what happens when one takes @xmath85 in ( [ sek3 ] ) . for the @xmath86 heterotic compactifications",
    "the entropy becomes @xmath87 on the other hand , for the action with gauss - bonnet @xmath0 term we obtain @xmath88 these black holes are _ small _ , meaning that their horizon is generated ( regularized ) by higher - derivative terms in the action .",
    "contrary to the large black holes discussed before , for these small black holes microscopic stringy description _ is _ known ( in the special 2-charge case of @xmath89 heterotic compactification microstates are well - known perturbative dabholkar - harvey states ) for which statistical entropy was calculated @xcite .",
    "for bps states microscopic entropy ( for @xmath90 ) is _ exactly _ equal to the black hole entropy obtained from the action supplemented with just gauss - bonnet @xmath0-correction ( [ smallgb ] ) , and disagrees with the entropy obtained by using supersymmetric @xmath0-correction ( [ smallk3 ] ) .",
    "one needs in the action also higher gauss - bonnet densities @xcite . ]",
    "we have analysed near - horizon solutions for ( both bps and non - bps ) static spherically symmetric black holes of @xmath1 sugra actions with @xmath0-corrections , which are effective actions of tree - level heterotic string compactified on @xmath3 and @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , we have also made calculations by taking for @xmath0-correction just the gauss - bonnet density . in @xmath2 ,",
    "contrary to a situation in @xmath5 ( see @xcite for a review ) , for these two types of higher - derivative corrections formulae for the entropy are _ not _ matching .    for _ large _ black holes , where full stringy microscopic description is not known , obtained entropies of bps black holes are _ equal _ to the one obtained from osv conjecture and topological string , and are consistent with perturbative results up to @xmath77-order .",
    "the exact matchings obtained by using just the @xmath0-corrections in effective actions ( which has infinite expansion ) is surprising . for susy correction",
    "it has partial explanation through ads@xmath91/cft@xmath92 correspondence @xcite , but for small black holes where simple gauss - bonnet correction does the job ( and susy correction fails ) it is still a complete mistery .",
