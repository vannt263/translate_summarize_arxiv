    "this talk will be a short review of the status of the calculation of total cross - sections using a qcd driven mini - jet model@xcite , with particular emphasis on recent measurements and results of theoretical calculations of @xmath2 cross - sections .",
    "one of the aim of qcd is to calculate cross - sections for hadronic processes .",
    "we find that the level of available experimental information on total hadronic cross - sections has now reached a stage so as to allow , for the first time , definite progress in the calculation of the one quantity which has so far escaped a complete quantitative understanding in a qcd framework , namely the total hadronic cross - section .",
    "we have a complete set of processes , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 measured in a common energy range , @xmath6 , with the purely hadronic processes measured up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the latter allows for very good parametrizations in a large energy range , the other two cross - sections to test the qcd content of hadrons versus the one in the photons . in figure [ allxsec ]",
    "we show a compilation of all presently available photon and proton total cross - sections , scaling them so as to be able to compare one to each other .    for @xmath8 processes ,",
    "the scale factor is the product of a quark parton model factor @xmath9 multiplied by a vector meson dominance type factor @xmath10@xcite , for @xmath2 we just square this factor .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows :    1 .   in sect .",
    "ii we describe our recent results for @xmath2 and extrapolate them to @xmath8 2 .   in sect .",
    "iii we discuss a possible anstz on an extension of the minijet model to @xmath11 3 .   in sect .",
    "iv we present recent results for @xmath3 and @xmath12 , using an impact parameter distribution for partons in the hadrons obtained from the bloch - nordsieck summation technique , and discuss its possible extensions to real and virtual photons .",
    "while for quite some time the photon - photon data at lep exhibited a discrepancy between different collaborations ( although within the experimental errors ) , we now have two sets of data points which are in excellent agreement with each other",
    ". a theorist can then start his / her work .",
    "we show in figure [ maria ] the description of l3@xcite and opal data@xcite using the eikonal minijet model ( emm ) .",
    "the theoretical context in which this curve was obtained is discussed in @xcite : the emm uses the eikonal approximation @xcite to calculate the total cross - section , i.e. @xmath14 \\label{stotal}\\ ] ] and approximates the eikonal function neglecting @xmath15 and putting @xmath16 \\label{nbs}\\ ] ] where the qcd calculable jet cross - section is the quantity which drives the rise @xcite in all total cross - sections .",
    "this function is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the parton - parton cross - section for the subprocess @xmath19 , the sum runs over i , j , k , l,=parton type and the integration covers a region from a minimum @xmath20 to the entire phase space .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 is higly dependent upon the regulator @xmath22 and one of the aims of a complete qcd calculation is to eliminate this dependence .",
    "presently this is not yet possible , but one can nonetheless expect @xmath22 to be the smallest momentum exchanged between partons such that perturbative qcd can be applied , namely not less than 1 gev and probably not more than 2 gev .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is in principle energy dependent and @xmath24 can be interpreted as the probability for particle @xmath25 to behave like a hadron , i.e. @xmath26 and , typically , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , in order to obtain a description of the measured total cross - sections , there are other input quantities which need to be fixed , namely @xmath28 and the b - distribution function @xmath29 .",
    "one way to proceed has been , previously , to determine all the parameters from the process @xmath5 .",
    "however , the emm model is not working very well for the proton case , as discussed in @xcite , probably because of uncertainties in the hadronic transverse momentum distributions , and we have opted , in this note , for a different approach , namely we obtain the parameters from @xmath5 , extrapolate them to @xmath30 varying them within at most 10% to fit the @xmath2 cross - section , and then revert back and see what the best description of @xmath2 will produce , when applied to photoproduction .",
    "the result of this _ modus operandi _ is presented here . for figure [ maria ] ,",
    "we have chosen to describe the partonic matter distribution inside the hadrons through a function inspired by the pion electromagnetic form factor , namely @xmath31 the scale @xmath32 has been let to vary , according to an intrinsic transverse momentum anstz @xcite .",
    "thus , figure [ maria ] corresponds to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and grs @xcite type densities for the photon .",
    "next we extrapolate this curve to @xmath5 processes , putting @xmath36 , the proton form factor with dipole type expression instead of one of the photon type monopole expressions , grv type densities for the proton @xcite and grs for the photon .",
    "the result is the upper curve shown in figure [ camille ] and compared with old and recent data @xcite . for completeness and as a reference to our previous work",
    ", we also show a band , with the lowest curve corresponding to grv densities for both proton and photon , @xmath37 , @xmath38 for the photon , same @xmath39 as the upper curve , and @xmath40 .",
    "hadronic interactions of the virtual photon in @xmath41 and @xmath2 processes have been a subject of interest for some time now  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of experimental data on jet production with virtual photons at hera  @xcite and total @xmath11 cross - sections at lep  @xcite , has given added impetus to develop a model which will describe the total cross - sections for virtual photons , especially the resolved part  @xcite .    we want to develop a model to understand these cross - sections in the context of emm .",
    "we propose that the virtual photon description is the same as for the case of real photons except that the intrinsic transverse momentum anstz is complemented with a factor inspired by extended vector meson dominance@xcite . at high @xmath42 ,",
    "a factor like @xmath43 will suppress the part of the cross - section which has a hadronic content . in eq.([evmd ] ) , @xmath44 is the usual factor , @xmath45 , obtained from vector meson dominance and discussed in many papers@xcite . in figure",
    "[ virtual ] we show our predictions for the hadronic content of the @xmath11 cross - section , excluding for the time being the direct and single resolved contribution .",
    "similar results can also be obtained using factorization @xcite in the context of the aspen@xcite model .",
    "it is evident from the previous discussion , and we have pointed this out in many papers , that it is not possible to have a qcd description of the total cross - section without understanding the transverse momentum distribution of partons in the colliding hadrons , or , in the eikonal language , without understanding the impact parameter distribution .",
    "we have attempted such description , and will show in the following the main highlights .",
    "some very recent results in the case of proton proton and proton antiproton are shown in figure [ regge ] ,    where the two curves have been obtained using the eikonal formula of eq.([stotal ] ) , the jet cross - sections with grv densities and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "unlike the curves obtainable in a straightforward application of the emm with b - distribution determined by the proton form factor , this figure uses an s - dependent b - distribution given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the transverse momentum distribution of colliding partons generated by soft gluon radiation from the initial state and , to leading order , @xmath51 \\log { { q_{max}+\\sqrt{q_{max}^2-k_t^2 } } \\over { q_{max}-\\sqrt{q_{max}^2-k_t^2 } } } \\label{hb}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 are energy dependent inasmuch as the kinematics of a given subprocess determine how much energy is available to single soft gluon emission .",
    "the energy dependence appears through the quantity @xmath54 which is a function of the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath55 and @xmath22 .",
    "in addition @xmath52 depends upon the single soft gluon distribution function @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath50 is summed over all possible gluon distributions , the infrared divergence is of course cancelled , there remains , however , the problem of evaluating @xmath57 in the infrared limit .",
    "we have used a phenomenological anstz , namely a singular but integrable @xmath58 and the result shown in figure [ regge ] is discussed in @xcite for the rising part of the total proton cross - sections .",
    "the main characteristics of this treatment is that , as the minijet cross - section rises with energy , soft gluon emission produces an acollinearity of the partons and reduces the probability of collisions .",
    "this affects the cross - sections in two ways : at low energy it produces a very soft decrease in @xmath59 and contributes to the faster decrease in @xmath60 , at high energy it tames the rise due to @xmath61 .",
    "it is then possible to have a very small @xmath22 to see the very beginning of the rise around @xmath62 , without having too large a cross - section when the energy climbs into the tev range and beyond .",
    "the above discussion illustrates also the way to study virtual and real photon interactions : the aim is to obtain an energy and momentum dependence in the impact parameter distribution through the kinematics characterizing real or virtual photon process , as it has been done for the proton . at high @xmath42",
    ", one can expect @xmath54 in eq.([hb ] ) to increase with @xmath42 , thus producing the same suppression effect that high c.m .",
    "energy values have in the softening of the rise due to the jets .",
    "the overall effect may be similar to the evmd factor discussed in sect .",
    "work is in progress to apply the bloch - nordsieck formalism to these collisions .",
    "we have discussed total cross - sections for protons and photons , real and virtual , using qcd calculable mini - jets cross - sections as the physical process which drives the rise of all total cross - sections .",
    "we have used the eikonal formalism to unitarize the cross - section and discussed possible ways to reduce the arbitrariness introduced in this formalism by the impact parameter distribution . a qcd model using soft gluon summation has been presented and compared with data for purely proton processes .",
