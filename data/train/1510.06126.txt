    "<S> the franson interferometer delay @xmath13 can be made reconfigurable and set equal to the frame duration @xmath3 that varies with @xmath4 . referring to our security analysis @xcite , for a fixed degradation of franson visibility , a larger @xmath13 leads to a lower excess noise of the frequency correlation eve could exploit . </S>",
    "<S> this modification thus allows a tighter bound on @xmath10 for large frames , therefore boosting the pie key capacity even beyond the present experiment . with the same experimental parameters used in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , except that @xmath52 , we obtain a pie of 8.8 bits for @xmath53 , and a resultant key throughput about 5 times higher than the photon reception rate . in applications in which the transmitter s photon flux is constrained , such as satellite - based sources with a limited power consumption budget , the gain in pie offered by ppm - qkd directly translates to an enhancement of the key throughput at the receiver .    to conclude , we have proposed and implemented ppm - qkd that is secure against collective gaussian attacks via ppm encoding of a classical light source and highly - accurate franson interferometry using an auxiliary time - energy entangled source . </S>",
    "<S> our proof - of - principle system demonstrates photon - efficient key distribution using practical ingaas spads , achieving 2.5 mbit / s throughput at loss equivalent to 25 km of fiber that is unambiguously higher than the photon reception rate . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our unoptimized ppm - qkd demonstration already delivered secret - key rates comparable to the highest of decoy - state bb84  @xcite with much fewer transmitted photons , and we expect the trend to persist at longer distances because of the same scaling of key rates with channel loss . unlike decoy - state bb84 , ppm - qkd implements the decoy state protocol passively , hence it may be less prone to information leakage . </S>",
    "<S> our ppm scheme may thrive in quantum communication applications that operate in the photon - starved reception regime , such as satellite - based quantum crypto - links with constrained photon - flux transmitters  @xcite or a quantum local ( metropolitan ) access network in which end user - nodes use inexpensive detectors with limited detection efficiencies and count rates .    </S>",
