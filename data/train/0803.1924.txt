    "the lyman @xmath1 emission line has attracted large attention as a spectral signature for identifying galaxies and securing redshifts at large distances .",
    "this emission line , however , is fraught with difficulty . because ly@xmath1 photons are resonantly scattered by neutral hydrogen , they may suffer more dust attenuation than adjacent uv continuum photons ; their escape is also affected by the relative geometries of neutral and ionized interstellar gas , and , last but not least , by the velocity structure of neutral gas .",
    "the first two factors have been extensively discussed in the light of iue observations of nearby star - forming galaxies @xcite ( and references therein ) and with model calculations @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the crucial role of the velocity structure of neutral gas has been shown by the hst spectra of nearby star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "similar evidence was offered by the spectra of lyman break galaxies ( lbg ) @xcite .",
    "ly@xmath1 photons mainly escape when they are scattered off neutral gas that is offset in velocity from the bulk of the ionized regions .",
    "the complexity of the escape of ly@xmath1 emission is also well illustrated by the broad distribution of ly@xmath1 strengths and profile - types observed in the lbg spectroscopic sample of @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath1 transmission mechanisms , especially the resulting emergent line profiles , have since been investigated in increasingly realistic models ( e.g. ) @xcite .",
    "an extensive review of all the aspects of the observations of the ly@xmath1 emission line in galaxies has been recently given by @xcite .",
    "the complex nature of ly@xmath1 escape was advocated for the disappointing results of earlier searches of distant ly@xmath1 emitters ( e.g. ) @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the ly@xmath1 emission remains the only mean for identifying galaxies when the continuum becomes too faint to be detected , and , following @xcite and @xcite , increasingly deeper and larger surveys have come into a widespread use for detecting galaxies at high redshifts . beyond the redshift of @xmath3 ,",
    "the increasingly neutral igm is not a complete obstacle to the visibility of ly@xmath1 emission ( e.g. ) @xcite and the density evolution of ly@xmath1 emitters may even help to trace the history of the cosmic re - ionization ( e.g. ) @xcite .",
    "although nearby galaxies have played a key role for understanding the factors affecting ly@xmath1 escape , their observations , using space - borne uv spectrographs in pointing mode , were directed to specific and known objects . as a consequence",
    ", there is not yet a systematic survey for redshifts smaller than those reachable from the ground .",
    "we use here the _ galex _",
    "spectroscopic survey mode for the first systematic search of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies at low redshift .",
    "goals are to understand ( i ) whether the ly@xmath1 escape is related to specific properties of galaxies , ( ii ) whether the ly@xmath1 emission evolves from current epoch to high z as the cosmic star formation rate traced by balmer lines or the uv continuum of galaxies .",
    "if so , the average relationship between the massive stellar content of the galaxies and the ly@xmath1 emission would be constant over time ; the ly@xmath1 emission might be used as a tracer of star formation , with an empirical calibration encapsulating the average effects of resonant scattering . if not , there would be an evidence for cosmic evolution of the physical processes , especially galactic winds , expected to play a central role in the ly@xmath1 escape from galaxies .",
    "the _ galex _ instrument and mission are described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopy mode utilizes a caf@xmath4 grism that can be moved into the convergent beam of the telescope to form simultaneous spectra of all sources in the field in both fuv and nuv bands .",
    "the usable wavelength range for relatively faint sources is approximately 1350 to 1750   for fuv ( 2nd order ) and 1950 to 2750   for nuv ( 1st order ) .",
    "the spectral resolution for a point source ( assuming a 5 arcsecond psf ) is @xmath0 8   for fuv and @xmath0 20   for nuv .",
    "details on the observations ( mutiple grism orientations in order to avoid the spectra overlap ) and the various steps of data reduction are given by @xcite .",
    "the spectral extraction is performed for all point sources in the direct image observations exceeding a s / n limit per resolution element in the co - added results of 2 in fuv and 3 in nuv .",
    "each resulting spectrum is a one - line image of 488 pixels with 3.5   per pixel and starting at 1300  .",
    "eleven fields observed in spectroscopy mode are available from the _ galex _ gr2 . in order to keep a relative homogeneity in the detection depth and related selection effects",
    "we have concentrated on five fields with an exposure time larger than 70,000 s and covering an area of 5.65 square deg .",
    "the characteristics of these five fields are summarized in table 1 , with the total number of spectra extracted by the reduction pipeline and the number of objects identified in the same fields with the direct imaging mode . each spectrum has been visually inspected and potential ly@xmath1 emission features have been measured ( central wavelength , line flux , equivalent width and full width at half maximum , fwhm ) with the iraf splot package ( gaussian fitting ) . the signal to noise ratio does not permit reasonable identifications of ly@xmath1 absorption .    the objects with a fwhm larger than about 15    in the fuv domain and about 27    in the nuv are classified as broad - line agns .",
    "these limits are based on the minimum value of 1200 km s@xmath5 , observed in the distribution of the fwhm of h@xmath1 emission line of galaxies in the sdss @xcite and found to make a separation between the broad - line agns and other emission - line objects .",
    "these limits take into account the average redshift and the spectral resolution in the respective galex uv bands .",
    "the presence / absence of emission lines such as ovi , ciii , civ , when the redshift is appropriate and the brightness large enough for detection in the galex bands , is also used to confirm the classification , especially when the fwhm values are close to the limit values .    in the nuv domain , only broad - line agns are found according to our criterions .",
    "this is consistent with the nuv ( ab ) limiting magnitude of 22 of the vast majority of extracted spectra . at the redshift of 0.65 , the lowest redshift at which a ly@xmath1 emitter can be detected in the nuv band",
    ", this flux limit would imply an ( ab ) absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath6 , a value extreme and rare for galaxies , as shown by the evolution of the galaxy 1500    luminosity function @xcite .",
    "this situation is aggravated by the dilution of narrow spectral features into the @xmath0 20    nuv spectral resolution which plays against the detection of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies .",
    "it is found impossible to identify narrow - line agns among our potential ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies because either their associated civ line is redshifted into the noisy wavelength domain between the fuv and nuv , or the object is too faint for a detection of the ciii or civ lines .",
    "a contamination by narrow - line agns is probably present and it will be seen in the next subsection whether additional spectral information can help .",
    "as our blind search was open to all extracted spectra and not limited to galaxies with the appropriate redshift , we have an increased risk of spurious detections .",
    "we have therefore classified our candidates into three categories ( good , fair and uncertain ) in order to try to control if the properties of our objects depend on the quality of their identification , even though the sample sizes are changing .",
    "[ fig1 ] gives a few examples of these spectra with the proposed identification .",
    "the identification of potential ly@xmath1 features is also hampered at both ends of the spectral range by fluctuations that increase because of the decrease in efficiency . in between",
    ", the useful spectral range is not constant from object to object . for the problems that require a control of the volume surveyed , we have defined the largest wavelength domain that we have been able to search in relatively uniform conditions for all the objects .",
    "this wavelength range 1459  1642    translates in a redshift window 0.2  0.35 for the ly@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the number of ly@xmath1 emission line candidates resulting from our blind search , as well as those retained for the discussion of luminosity functions ( quality 1 and 2 only ; @xmath2 ) are listed in table 1 for each field investigated .",
    "the total numbers are 96 and 66 respectively in these two categories .",
    "table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of our candidates with the line flux of the emission features , and , assuming an identification to ly@xmath1 emission , the redshift and the derived ly@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "the line fluxes and ly@xmath1 luminosities include a correction factor resulting from a re - calibration of the spectral response , that was verified to make no systematic differences on average between the direct image photometry and the fluxes derived from an integration of the spectra .",
    "the one - sigma precision on the line flux measurement is of the order of @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath5 . in combination with an evaluation of the uncertainty in the determination of the uv continuum adjacent to the emission line , this number gives a precision on the equivalent width ( ew ) from about 25 % at ew",
    "@xmath0 20   to 15 % at ew @xmath0 100  .      as a control of our blind search ,",
    "we have compared our results with existing information about each candidate , especially any redshift from spectroscopy or photometry in the optical .",
    "we are mostly concerned by spurious features and not confusion with another emission line since ly@xmath1 emission is known as unique in the fuv spectra of galaxies .",
    "the possibility of identifying narrow - line agns would also be of interest since we have shown it was difficult in practice with the uv spectra alone .",
    "each of our 96 candidates was searched in the ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) and the recent data release 3 of deep2 @xcite ; the 14 redshifts found are displayed in table 2 .",
    "only one of these redshifts , based on combo-17 photometric measurements @xcite and possibly affected by misidentification in a dense group , is in significant disagreement with the evaluation based on the ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "all 14 objects are classified as galaxies .",
    "although this cross - verification is presently limited to a small subset of candidates , it is seen as an encouraging validation of our approach .",
    "the small number of redshifts available from the visible was somewhat expected : on one hand , the sdss spectroscopic survey ( available in 3 of our 5 fields ) has a small fraction of galaxies at @xmath9 , on the other hand the _ galex _ spectroscopy is not deep enough for overlapping well the specific and deep redshift surveys with large telescopes .",
    "our ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates are compared with the other uv sources of _ galex _ , especially those identified as galaxies , in order to see whether the presence of the ly@xmath1 line is related to any galaxy property .",
    "such a comparison can also illustrate the importance of selection effects . in the plot of the fuv flux vs. uv color ,",
    "the 96 ly@xmath1 emitting candidates lie at the faint magnitude and blue color boundaries of the domain occupied by the 736 objects classified as galaxies but without ly@xmath1 features .",
    "the faint magnitude boundary has a natural explanation with our candidates being faint since in principle at @xmath10 .",
    "the blue color boundary has two possible explanations . on one hand ,",
    "easier ly@xmath1 escape may come with less dust and bluer color ; on the other hand , bluer color may imply a higher fuv continuum flux and easier detection of emitting features .",
    "another aspect of the comparison of our ly@xmath1 emitting candidates with respect to the general population of _ galex _ sources is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with the distribution of the fuv magnitudes .",
    "this distribution is displayed for four samples , the uv sources detected in the images , the extracted spectra , the objects classified as galaxies ( without any emission feature ) and the ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates . the spectra appear to have been systematically extracted down to a magnitude of 21.5 , a level at which samples are complete according to the completeness analysis of _ galex _ images by @xcite . the distribution of objects classified as galaxies also peak at this limit . at the bright end of the distribution ,",
    "the proportion of galaxies with ly@xmath1 emission is naturally low since the objects are selected at @xmath10 . at the faint end , the number of objects classified as galaxies and the number of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates are very similar .",
    "this does not mean that all identified faint galaxies have ly@xmath1 in emission since the samples are by construction distinct .",
    "this tells that the identification of faint galaxies is relatively easier with than without an emission feature .",
    "the distribution of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates peak at @xmath11 magnitude .",
    "they are clearly affected by incompleteness .      the distribution of ly@xmath1 rest - frame equivalent widths is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . beyond a completeness limit at about 20  ,",
    "the distribution is comparable with that of @xcite for lbgs at @xmath12 .",
    "the fraction of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies ( with ew @xmath13  ) relative to the number of star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath14 can not be determined directly because redshift measurements are available only in limited areas and , in these areas , the number of matches with _ galex _",
    "spectra is very small .",
    "we can rely on evaluations based on the _ galex _ far - uv survey and use the luminosity functions derived by @xcite in the redshift range @xmath15 to calculate the total number of galaxies up to a given magnitude in a volume comparable to our observed volume .",
    "up to magnitude ( ab ) of 21 and 21.5 , the number of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies with ew @xmath16   are respectively 9 ( out of 58 ) and 36 ( out of 243 ) , corresponding to a fraction of 15 % of the total number of ( star - forming ) galaxies .",
    "this fraction is lower than the fraction of 25 % reported by @xcite for lbgs at @xmath12 .",
    "this difference may reflect differences between the methods of evaluation .",
    "the spectroscopic sample of @xcite does not have a uv flux limit as we had to use for the determination of the size of the parent population since our candidates are searched among objects of unknown redshifts . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference is consistent with the trend of lower incidence of ly@xmath1 emission at low redshift found by @xcite ; they , however , report a fast decline of the fraction of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies ( ew @xmath16  ) with a value of 8 % in the redshift bin @xmath17 .    the ly@xmath1 rest - frame ews displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are consistent with the large spread of values predicted by the stellar population models of @xcite and any amount of ly@xmath1 quenching in the resonant scattering process .",
    "the ew values larger than model predictions that raise problems at high redshift @xcite are not found .",
    "we also examine how the ly@xmath1 strength varies across our sample as a function of different galaxy parameters .",
    "the most obvious parameters are those relative to the uv continuum emission as obtained from _",
    "photometry ; these data have the advantage to be naturally available for all our candidates .",
    "the variation of the ly@xmath1 rest - frame ew as a function of the uv color does not show any trend ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "insofar as the uv color reflects the continuum extinction , this is consistent with a decoupling of the reddening of line and continuum photons in the resonant scattering process .",
    "this is in contrast with the trend reported by @xcite of the ew increasing when the uv continuum slope becomes bluer .",
    "their trend , however , encompasses a much wider range of ew than ours , from strong absorption to strong emission , and would be less significant if restricted to our actual limited range of ew",
    ".    the ly@xmath1 rest - frame ew does not reveal any trend either as a function of the uv luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the deficiency of strong ly@xmath1 emissions reported in the most luminous high - z lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite is not directly comparable since it takes place at an absolute magnitude @xmath18 , a limit that we do not reach in our sample .",
    "however , the fraction of objects with large ew is small in fig . [ fig5 ] and",
    "such objects would likely be missing in a smaller sample of ly@xmath1 emitters .",
    "this suggests that , in addition to the interpretations given by @xcite , the trend seen at high redshift may be due or enhanced by small number statistics .",
    "[ fig5 ] allows us also to identify ultra - violet luminous galaxies ( uvlgs ) .",
    "this class of galaxies was defined by @xcite among _ galex _ local galaxies to overlap the luminosity range of typical high - z lbgs . with the actual definition of @xcite we have 11 uvlgs in our sample at the left of the dotted vertical line in fig .",
    "these uvlgs do not have ew as large as those found in less luminous objects .",
    "this is comparable , albeit at lower luminosity , with the trend reported for the high - z lbgs .",
    "this may also be explained by small number statistics . using the uv continuum lf obtained in the redshift range @xmath19 by @xcite",
    ", we calculate a density of uvlgs of about @xmath20 mpc@xmath21 , predicting about 24 of these objects in the redshift window @xmath2 and our 5 fields . with this evaluation",
    ", about 33 % ( 8/24 ) of the uvlgs have ly@xmath1 in emission ( with an ew larger than about 20  ) which is a larger fraction than found above for the general population .",
    "given the luminosity range of the uvlgs and the redshift window , incompleteness can not explain that difference .",
    "in contrast the evaluation of the number of luminous galaxies based on the bright end of the uv luminosity function is uncertain . on the other hand",
    "it is possible that a larger uv luminosity may contribute to a larger ly@xmath1 escape .",
    "this would be consistent , in addition to a possible evolution of the ly@xmath1 escape fraction , with the higher incidence of ly@xmath1 emission at higher redshifts reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "galaxy parameters which are not derived from _ galex _",
    "observations are available for only a fraction of our relatively distant objects .",
    "an extreme example is the h@xmath1 line emission which would be interesting in order to get the amount of ionizing radiation without the complication of resonant scattering and , therefore , the ly@xmath1 escape fraction . in spite of the 12 spectroscopic redshifts found in the literature ( table 2 ) , we have been unable for various reasons ( essentially lack of calibrated fluxes ) to recover the h@xmath1 flux in more than 2 galaxies .",
    "the resulting ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratios are found to be 19 ( groth-21024 ) much above the theoretical recombination ratio of 8.7 and 5 ( groth-34512 ) which is larger than any reported value in near - by star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "these findings illustrate the difficulties of spectrophotometric comparisons and the need for a dedicated optical spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "the sdss photometry ( u , g , r , i , z filters ) is available for three of our five fields and 64 of our ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates .",
    "we have calculated the ( nuv@xmath22r ) color which has been extensively used by @xcite in their study of galaxy colors with _",
    "galex _ and is known to make a pronounced demarcation between the blue and red sequences .",
    "the range of colors obtained for our ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates is in good agreement with the values expected from galaxies .",
    "we find no trend between this color and the ly@xmath1 rest - frame ew , the ly@xmath1 line luminosity and the fuv luminosity .",
    "the ( u@xmath22r ) vs. ( nuv@xmath22r ) color - color diagram ( fig . [ fig6 ] ) shows a sequence in good agreement with the blue part of the sequence ( nuv@xmath22r @xmath23 4 ) obtained in the same diagram by @xcite on a very large sample of galaxies ( their figure 22 ) .",
    "in contrast the density of galaxies along our sequence is relatively constant whereas it increases in the diagram of @xcite with the ( nuv@xmath22r ) color increasing from 0 to @xmath24 .",
    "this difference results probably from the selection of our objects among star - forming galaxies with a significant far - uv continuum and at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "we have separated the objects of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] into three groups according to their ly@xmath1 ew values .",
    "these categories do not appear segregated either along or perpendicular to the sequence which is primarily driven , as suggested by @xcite , by star formation history . since the ly@xmath1 ew ( without any transfer )",
    "is predicted rather stable as a function of time in galaxies with constant star formation @xcite , this illustrates the dominant role of individual radiation transfer effects in the ly@xmath1 escape rather than the stellar population properties ( e.g. ) @xcite",
    "for this approach we need conditions of detection as uniform as possible .",
    "we have therefore restricted ourselves to the redshift range @xmath25 and have retained only the objects of quality 1 or 2 in order to limit spurious detections .",
    "we have used the v / v@xmath26 method . for each ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidate",
    ", v@xmath26 is the volume over which a source of the same ly@xmath1 luminosity could lie and still meet the blind search criteria .",
    "the inverse volumes of all the galaxies in a particular luminosity bin are summed to estimate the luminosity function in that bin .",
    "v@xmath26 is defined by the field of view and the redshift range @xmath27 .",
    "the redshift @xmath28 is 0.35 if the ly@xmath1 luminosity is bright enough that the line remains above the line flux limit out to the upper bound of the redshift window .",
    "the corresponding volume , maximum value of v@xmath26 , is @xmath29 mpc@xmath21 taking into account a 0.6 deg field of view radius . for fainter sources",
    ", @xmath28 is the redshift ( @xmath30 ) at which the ly@xmath1 flux falls below the line flux limit . in this determination the ly@xmath1 flux is decreased as the inverse square of the luminosity distance since the ly@xmath1 is not spectrally resolved in the galaxies .",
    "the determination of @xmath28 is somewhat uncertain since it is based on the line flux limit which is evaluated empirically in each field and results from both the depth of each field and the continuum level of the spectra . in practice",
    ", slight adjustements have been made to account for the specific noise in each spectra .",
    "because of the relatively narrow redshift window , only the sources with a ly@xmath1 luminosity less than 10@xmath31 erg s@xmath5 may be affected by these uncertainties in volume evaluation .    in order to combine the results obtained over the five fields we have to deal with the differences of depth . with the upper redshift limit of 0.35 , the sources with ly@xmath1 luminosity log(l )",
    "@xmath32 41.8 ( erg s@xmath5 ) are essentially above the line flux limits in all fields and can be reasonably merged . adopting a bin width of 0.2 in log(l ) , we have summed up the inverse volumes in their respective bins over the 5 fields and divided by 5 to account for the increased volume .",
    "it is possible to get the luminosity function below the limit of log(l ) = 41.8 ( erg s@xmath5 ) at the expense of cosmic variance by using only the deepest three fields , cdfs , groth and ngpdws ( cf table 1 ) .",
    "we have repeated the summations of inverse volumes over these three fields .",
    "the bin below log(l ) = 41.6 ( erg s@xmath5 ) is again affected by incompleteness and the lowest bin with only one source has been discarded as unsignificant .    the resulting luminosity function per log ly@xmath1 luminosity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . as a generic consequence of detection thresholds in images ,",
    "the lowest bins of the luminosity function are affected by incompleteness .",
    "we have not tried to remedy this type of incompleteness and will only refrain to use the lowest luminosity bins in further discussion .",
    "in contrast to the generic incompleteness accompanying the lowest bins of the luminosity function , we have another source of incompleteness attached to the spectroscopic functionality of the grism images .",
    "the inclusion of a detected galaxy in the luminosity function depends on the detection of the ly@xmath1 line .",
    "this source of incompleteness , which has no reasons to be confined to the lowest luminosity bins , can take two aspects .",
    "first , a number of features with small equivalent width may be missed by lack of contrast over the continuum flux : the distribution of ews ( similar to the distribution of rest - frame ew in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) shows this happens below approximately ew = 20  .",
    "second , objects with ew larger than about 20   may be missed because their continuum flux is too low for a spectrum to have been extracted : fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that spectra are not systematically extracted below a fuv magnitude of 21.5 .    in order to understand the mechanisms of this second aspect of the incompleteness ,",
    "we have illustrated the interplay between ew and observed fuv magnitudes in fig .",
    "because of the limited redshift range , each luminosity bin corresponds to a relatively narrow domain in this diagram . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the domain for the luminosity bin log(l@xmath33 ) 41.8  42.0 ( erg s@xmath5 ) , between the two curves corresponding to ly@xmath1 line fluxes of 1.5 and 8.7 @xmath34 erg @xmath8 s@xmath5 .",
    "this domain is cut in two by the horizontal continuum flux limit at magnitude 21.5 . in order to quantify the incompleteness",
    ", we first calculate the number of galaxies per 0.5 mag bin expected in our volume space as a function of uv magnitude .",
    "we use the luminosity function obtained with the fuv band of _ galex _ by @xcite in the range @xmath15 . in each 0.5 mag bin",
    "the galaxies are in turn distributed in 10    ew bins according to the observed ew distribution ( above the limit of 20  ) .",
    "this results in a number of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies for each elementary cell of size 0.5 mag and 10    ew in the diagram of fig .",
    "these galaxy numbers per elementary cell can be summed over the domain defined above in fig .",
    "the incompleteness factor is then taken as the ratio of the sum over the entire domain to the sum over the domain above the limit of 21.5 in magnitude .",
    "if we account for the galaxies fainter than 21.5 already contributing to the space densities plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we end up with an incompleteness factor of 6 for the ly@xmath1 luminosity bin 41.8  42.0 ( log erg s@xmath5 ) taken as example in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "we emphasize this correction factor does not result from simulated data but only from an evaluation using the fuv luminosity function and relying on the assumption that the observed ew distribution of galaxies apply to the less luminous galaxies involved in the evaluation .",
    "this assumption is supported by two facts .",
    "first , the observed ew distribution does not seem to change as a function of the uv luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) at least in the observed range of luminosity .",
    "second , the bulk of the correction factor originates from galaxies 1 or 1.5 mag fainter than the 21.5 limit with ews between 40 and 60  .",
    "this range of ew values seems less prone to change with luminosity than extreme values .",
    "as the uncertainties on the correction factor remain severe and the amplitude of the correction is increasing for the low luminosity bins , we have repeated the evaluation only for the three luminosity bins brighter than ( 41.8  42 . ) , finding correction factors of 4.2 , 2.6 , and 2.7 respectively . the brightest bin",
    ", corresponding to just one object , has not been corrected for .",
    "the space densities resulting from the incompleteness correction are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "[ fig8 ] can also illustrate the other source of incompleteness resulting from small ew features undetected by lack of contrast over the continuum ; the relevant objects would lie in the domain defined by the two lines and the limit at ew @xmath35 20  .",
    "the ew distribution is essentially unknown in this area but , for all reasonable assumptions , an evaluation based on the same scheme as above leads to a negligible additional factor .",
    "this is due to the fact that galaxies are bright in this domain ( at least those related to the high luminosity bins ) and consequently much less dense than the faint galaxies involved in the first source of incompleteness described above .      in the same way as the comparison of the ly@xmath1 luminosity with the h@xmath1 luminosity of an individual star - forming galaxy places constraints on the escape of ly@xmath1 photons through the resonant scattering process",
    ", we may compare the ly@xmath1 and the h@xmath1 luminosity functions of galaxies . since the escape of ly@xmath1 emission",
    "is expected to be highly variable from galaxy to galaxy , the comparison will lead to an average ( ly@xmath1 flux weighted ) value of the escape , as if all galaxies were the same . for this comparison",
    "we have used the h@xmath1 luminosity function of @xcite obtained at z @xmath36 , close to our redshift window .",
    "this luminosity function is itself consistent with other determinations @xcite .",
    "we adopt the values log(@xmath37 ) = 41.92 ergs s@xmath5 and log(@xmath38 ) = @xmath39 mpc@xmath21 as updated from @xcite to current cosmology ( @xmath40 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) by @xcite .",
    "because our binned data points are few and related to high luminosity values , we assume for our ly@xmath1 luminosity function the same value @xmath43 as determined for the h@xmath1 lf .",
    "the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio and the fraction of galaxies with ly@xmath1 emission are directly given by the factor of modifications of the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 to fit our ly@xmath1 data .",
    "a change of @xmath37 alone does not work well ( see one example in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) and a reasonable fit requires to decrease @xmath38 , or , as currently observed , to have ly@xmath1 in emission in only a fraction of the galaxies .",
    "although systematic errors may be present in our completeness correction , we have carried out a least - square fit on the 5 brightest luminosity data with @xmath37 and @xmath38 as free parameters .",
    "the fit ( fig . [ fig7 ] ) , given by log(@xmath37 ) = 41.98 @xmath44 ergs s@xmath5 and log(@xmath38 ) = @xmath45 @xmath46 mpc@xmath21 , implies a ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio of about 1 in 15 % of the galaxies . as expected",
    ", the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio is much lower than the ratio of 8.7 predicted by the case b recombination theory .",
    "this is in rough agreement with the range of values reported in nearby galaxies by @xcite .",
    "this implies an average ly@xmath1 escape fraction of about 0.1 somewhere between the average values of 0.02 and 0.8 in the galaxy formation models of @xcite and @xcite respectively .    at this stage , it is also possible to show that the ly@xmath1 luminosity function is not affected by the fact that we have been unable to distinguish and remove narrow - line agns from our sample of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates .",
    "we use the h@xmath1 luminosity function of narrow - line agns derived from the sdss by @xcite with the criterion of @xcite which gives the largest number of objects .",
    "the ly@xmath1 lf is derived with the ly@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio of 3.24 reported by @xcite from sdss composite quasar spectra .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows that the contribution of narrow - line agns remains small even if we account for some evolution between the redshift window of the sdss sample ( 0 - 0.15 ) and ours ( 0.2 - 0.35 ) .",
    "the space densities of _ galex _ ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies at @xmath2 are interesting to compare with the ly@xmath1 lfs found at high redshift . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we have first plotted the ly@xmath1 lf obtained by @xcite at redshifts @xmath47 which is selected because it is the closest from our data in terms of redshift . in addition , the authors have compared their data with the measurements available at the time ( references therein and their figure 5 ) .",
    "they conclude that the luminosity function of ly@xmath1 emitters does not significantly change from z @xmath48 to z = 5.7 .",
    "this is confirmed by more recent determinations from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a few lfs at @xmath49 have been left out of the comparison because variations of ly@xmath1 lfs are possible that would not be related to the galaxies themselves but to the igm opacity resulting from changes in the igm neutral fraction accompanying the re - ionisation .",
    "of the recent ly@xmath1 lfs at high redshift , we have elected for clarity to reproduce in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] only those closest from our redshift range , i.e. the two from @xcite and @xcite at @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows that the space density of the ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies is much lower in the range @xmath2 than at redshifts about 3 .",
    "we have quantified this factor by a least - square fit on the 5 brightest data points , using the same @xmath1 parameter ( @xmath51 ) as @xcite ( adopted by these authors from @xcite ) ; we have obtained log(@xmath37 ) = 42.03 @xmath52 ergs s@xmath5 and log(@xmath38 ) = @xmath53 @xmath54 mpc@xmath21 .    by comparison with the values @xmath37",
    "= @xmath55 ergs s@xmath5 and @xmath38 = @xmath56 mpc@xmath21 of @xcite , our determination implies a ly@xmath1 luminosity density ( ld ) @xmath57 times larger at @xmath12 than at @xmath2 . in comparison ,",
    "the fuv ld of @xcite increases by a factor of about 5 between @xmath58 and @xmath12 , an increase consistent with the compilations of sfr evolution of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have illustrated this difference in the evolution rates of the fuv and ly@xmath1 luminosity densities in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] by plotting the effect of a factor 5 decrease of the parameters @xmath37 or @xmath38 of the lf of @xcite .",
    "although the effect looks significant , we discuss further the uncertainties in our approach as well as possible interpretations .",
    "\\1 ) insofar as the fuv ld measures the evolution of the massive stellar content of the galaxies , the faster rate of evolution of the ly@xmath1 ld suggests a real increase ( by a factor of about 3 ) of the ly@xmath1 escape fraction from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of an increase with redshift of the fraction of ( ew @xmath32 20 ) ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies ( this paper , @xcite ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the current idea that galactic winds are increasing with redshift , favouring the ly@xmath1 escape while mitigating the increased fraction of neutral hydrogen in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "\\2 ) the rate of increase of the ly@xmath1 ld between @xmath58 and @xmath12 depends on the uncertainties of @xmath37 and @xmath38 at both redshifts , i.e. 4 parameters . if we combine the variances obtained from our least - square fit with those given by @xcite , the standard deviation on the factor 16.5 is as large as 11.5 and the evolution of the ly@xmath1 ld is faster than the fuv ld at a significance of about 84% .",
    "\\3 ) a change in the faint - end slope @xmath1 of the lf may play a role in the evolution of the ly@xmath1 ld which writes as @xmath61 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is indeed poorly constrained by the space densities of the luminous ly@xmath1 emitters that are observed both by _ galex _ and at high redshift .",
    "this parameter is assumed to be the same in our comparison between low and high redshifts .",
    "a steepening of the slope @xmath1 at low z , resulting in an increase of @xmath62 could make the evolution of the ly@xmath1 ld matching that of the fuv ld .",
    "this would mean an increase of the ly@xmath1 escape fraction in low - luminosity objects at low z. such a variation , however , would be opposite to the current trend of a steepening of the faint - end slope with redshift ( e.g. @xcite for fuv lf ) as expected in the hierarchical formation scenario of galaxies .    in conclusion ,",
    "the faster rate of evolution of the ly@xmath1 luminosity density with respect to the cosmic star formation rate is significant at about 84% and indicates probably an increase of the average ly@xmath1 escape fraction from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "a blind search of potential ly@xmath1 emission features has been conducted on 7018 spectra obtained in 5 deep spectroscopic exposures with _",
    "galex_. 96 ly@xmath1 emitting galaxy candidates are identified , after a separation from agns essentially on the basis of the fwhm .",
    "they are mostly in the reshift range ( 0.2 @xmath22 0.35 ) .",
    "the following properties stand out :    \\1 ) the ly@xmath1 rest frame equivalent width distribution is comparable with that reported by @xcite for lbgs at @xmath63 .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with ly@xmath1 emission ( ew @xmath16  ) seems smaller , 15% against 25% in the lbg sample .",
    "\\2 ) no trend is found between the ew and the ( fuv @xmath22 nuv ) color , in agreement with a decoupling of the reddening of line and continuum photons in ly@xmath1 resonant scattering .",
    "there is no trend either of the ew with the uv luminosity , except a decrease in a sub - sample of ultra - violet luminous galaxies ( uvlgs ) . as at very high - redshifts",
    ", small - number statistics might play a role here . a larger fraction of ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies ( ew @xmath64  ) is found among uvlgs .",
    "\\3 ) a sub - sample of 66 emission features of better quality and strictly in the reshift range ( 0.2 @xmath22 0.35 ) has been used to calculate the space densities of the ly@xmath1 emitting galaxies .",
    "a scheme has been presented to correct for a major source of incompleteness , the fact that spectra of objects with significant ew may have not been extracted because their continuum is too weak .",
    "\\5 ) a comparison of the ly@xmath1 luminosity functions at @xmath65 and @xmath12 shows an evolution beyond that expected from the evolution of the massive stellar content of star - forming galaxies at a significance level of 84% , suggesting a increase of the average ly@xmath1 escape fraction with redshift .",
