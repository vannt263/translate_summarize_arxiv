    "with the increasing concern about the , a growing attention has been recently devoted to the concept of rf energy harvesting .",
    "the idea of using the same electromagnetic field for transferring both information and power to the wireless devices , called simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) , is one of the most appealing techniques in this context .",
    "swipt is a promising solution to increase the lifetime of wireless nodes and hence alleviate the energy bottleneck of energy constrained wireless networks .",
    "it is predicted that swipt will become an indispensable building block for many commercial and industry wireless systems in the future , including the upcoming internet of things ( iot ) systems , wireless sensor networks and small - cell networks @xcite .",
    "the ideal swipt receiver architecture assumes that energy can be extracted from the same signal as that used for information decoding @xcite .",
    "however , the current circuit designs are not yet able to implement this extraction , since the energy carried by the rf signal is lost during the information decoding process . as a result",
    ", a considerable effort has been devoted to the study of different practical swipt receiver architectures , namely , the parallel receiver architecture and the co - located receiver architecture @xcite .",
    "a parallel receiver architecture equips the energy harvester and the information receiver with independent antennas for energy harvesting ( eh ) and information decoding ( i d ) . in a co - located receiver architecture , the energy harvester and the information receiver share the same antennas .",
    "two common methods to design such kind of receivers are time - switching ( ts ) and power - splitting ( ps ) . in ts ,",
    "the receiver switches in time between eh and i d , while in ps the receiver splits the received signal into two streams of different power values for eh and i d .",
    "swipt has to be realized by properly allocating the available resources and sharing them among both information transfer and energy transfer .",
    "designing ts / ps swipt receivers in a point - to - point wireless environment to achieve various trade - offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting is considered in @xcite . in multi - user environments , researches on swipt focus on the power and subcarrier allocation among different users such that some criteria ( throughput , harvested power , fairness , etc . ) are met . for the multi - user downlink channel , various policies",
    "have been proposed for single input - single output ( siso ) and multi input - single output ( miso ) configurations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "resource allocation algorithm design aiming at the maximization of data transmission energy efficiency in a siso ps swipt multi - user system is considered in @xcite with an orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) .",
    "a miso configuration offers the additional degree of freedom of beamforming vector optimization at the transmitter . in @xcite , a joint beamforming and",
    "ps ratio allocation scheme was designed to minimize the power cost under the constraints of throughput and harvested energy .",
    "the problem of joint power control and time switching in miso swipt systems by considering the long - term power consumption and heterogeneous quality of service ( qos ) requirements for different types of traffics is also studied in @xcite .",
    "the energy efficient beamforming design in miso heterogeneous cellular networks including separate eh and i d receivers is addressed in @xcite .",
    "beamformers are designed with two aims of maximizing the information transmission efficiency of i d users and energy harvesting efficiency of eh users while taking the minimal rate requirement and the minimal harvested power threshold for i d users and eh users into account .",
    "swipt in a mimo interference channel with two transmitter - receiver pairs is studied in @xcite .",
    "when both receivers are set in i d and eh mode , beamforming vectors are found to maximize the achievable sum rate and the harvested energy , respectively .",
    "also for the mixed case of one i d receiver and one eh receiver , transmit strategies are proposed in order to maximize the energy transfer to the eh receiver and minimize the interference to the i d receiver .",
    "ps swipt in a multi - user mimo interference channel scenario is also studied in @xcite .",
    "the objective is to minimize the total transmit power of all transmitters by jointly designing the transmit beamformers , power splitters , and receiver filters , subject to the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) constraint for i d and the harvested power constraint for eh at each receiver .",
    "all the above works consider single cell cases with one base station ( bs ) and single or multiple mobile users . in a multi - cell case the system becomes interference limited .",
    "however , while interference links are harmful for information decoding , they are useful for energy harvesting",
    ". the swipt beamforming design for multiple cells with coordinated multipoint approach ( comp ) is addressed in @xcite .",
    "the objective is the minimization of the total network transmit power and the maximum capacity consumption for the backhaul link under constraints on the sinrs and the values of harvested energy .",
    "sparse beamforming for real - time energy trading in comp - swipt networks is also studied in @xcite .",
    "as we have seen so far in the literature overview of swipt , these works have considered single objective optimization ( soo ) framework to formulate the problem of resource allocation or beamforming optimization .",
    "popular objectives are classical performance metrics such as ( weighted ) sum rate/ throughput ( to be maximized ) , or transmit power ( to be minimized ) , or sum of energy harvested ( to be maximized ) . in soo one of these objectives",
    "is selected as the sole objective while the others are considered as constraints .",
    "this approach assumes that one of the objectives is of dominating importance and also it requires prior knowledge about the accepted values of the constraints related to the other objectives .",
    "however , the multi - objective optimization ( moo ) investigates the optimization of the vector of objectives , for nontrivial situations where there is a conflict between objectives .",
    "this approach has been proposed lately for wireless information systems @xcite and is considered for a parallel swipt system in @xcite very recently .",
    "the considered system consists of a multi - antenna transmitter , a single - antenna information receiver , and multiple energy harvesting receivers equipped with multiple antennas . in this scenario ,",
    "the trade - off between the maximization of the energy efficiency of information transmission and the maximization of the wireless power transfer efficiency is studied by means of resource allocation using an moo framework .",
    "the fundamental approach used in this paper is also moo .",
    "we address the joint moo of transmit precoding and receiver design in a ts miso swipt system and our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * different from previous works , we consider a miso swipt system consisting of multiple multi - antenna access points ( aps ) which serve multiple single antenna user equipments ( ues ) .",
    "therefore , the problem formulation and the proposed algorithm in this work can be simply applied to . as a result ,",
    "the term ue in this paper refers to a broader range of devices encompassing the ones directly used by the end - users and the autonomous sensors .",
    "* we have assumed the ts swipt technique , which is practically feasible and can be implemented using simple switches , while ps receivers require highly complex hardware due to different power sensitivity values of i d and eh parts in each receiver .",
    "* we formulate the problem to design the optimal transmit precoding matrix and the time switching ratio of each receiver jointly to maximize the utility vector including the achieved information data rates and harvested energies of all users simultaneously using moo framework .",
    "since an moo problem can not be solved in a globally optimal way , the pareto optimality @xcite of the resource allocation will be adopted as optimality criterion .",
    "this problem is a non - convex rank - constrained moo problem .",
    "first we relax the rank constraint and transform the problem into a non - convex soo semidefinite program ( sdp ) and after that we show that the optimal solution satisfies the rank constraint . in this framework",
    "we utilize the majorization - minimization algorithm @xcite to solve the nonconvex soo sdp .",
    "numerical results illustrate the trade - off between energy harvested and information data rate objectives and show the effect of optimizing the precoding strategy and ts ratio on this trade - off .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model and problem formulation .",
    "joint multi - objective design of spatial precoding and receiver time switching is studied in section iii . in section iv , we present numerical results and finally the paper is concluded in section v.",
    "we consider a multi - user miso downlink system for swipt over flat fading channels as shown in fig .",
    "the system consists of @xmath0 aps which are equipped with @xmath1 antennas and serve @xmath2 single antenna ues .",
    "the set of all ues and all aps are denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "each user is assumed to be served by multiple transmitters but the information symbols will be coded and emitted independently . therefore , the received signal in the @xmath5th ue can be modelled as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the information symbol from the aps to the @xmath9th ue which originates from independent gaussian codebooks , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the beamforming vector .",
    "we assume quasi - static flat fading channels for all ues and denote by @xmath12 the complex channel vector from the @xmath13th ap to the @xmath5th ue .",
    "also @xmath14 is the circularly symmetric complex gaussian receiver noise which includes the antenna noise and the i d processing noise in the @xmath5th user .        according to",
    ", the achievable data rate @xmath15 ( bits / sec / hz ) for the @xmath5th ue can be found from the following equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and therefore @xmath19 are rank - one matrices for @xmath20 .",
    "also the received energy @xmath21 ( assuming normalized energy unit of joule / sec ) in the @xmath5th ue is given by : @xmath22 in which the antenna noise power is neglected .",
    "the ues are assumed to be capable of information decoding and energy harvesting using ts receiver architecture . in ts scheme ,",
    "each reception time frame is divided into two orthogonal time slots , one for i d and the other for eh .",
    "therefore we have the following equations for the average data rate and the harvested energy at the @xmath5th ue : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be found from and , respectively , @xmath27 is the fraction of time devoted to i d in the @xmath5th ue and @xmath28 denotes the energy harvesting efficiency factor of the @xmath5th ue .",

    "since the information data rate and harvested energy are both desirable for each user , we define the utility vector of the @xmath5th ue by @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "our optimization objective is to maximize the utility vector of the system defined by @xmath32 $ ] jointly via the multi - objective problem formulation .",

    "as mentioned earlier , this ideal receiver is not feasible in practice , however , for theoretical benchmarking , its performance can be used as an upper bound for the performance of ts swipt .",

    "this result shows that these two objectives are generally conflicting and any resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the harvested energy can not maximize the data rate .",
    "also it can be seen that , increasing the number of ues highly affects the possible harvestable amount of energy at each ue .",
    "this result is expectable , due to the fixed total power consumption assumption and the direct impact of transmit power on the received energy .",

    "the useful kkt conditions for this problem can be written as : @xmath171 form the slack conditions , it can be inferred that only one of the @xmath172 can be positive . since if there exists @xmath126 for which we have @xmath173 , , result in : @xmath174 which is not possible in general for fixed values of @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "therefore the optimal solution occurs when we have : @xmath177 which results in : @xmath178 so we have @xmath179 and the other @xmath180 . now according to ,",
    ", we will have @xmath181 for the optimal solution in which @xmath182 now using we have : @xmath183 in which @xmath184 as a consequence we get : @xmath185 on the other side , according to if @xmath155 we have @xmath156 which is not the optimal solution",
