    "while active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are thought to be powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes at the centers of most galaxies , the geometry and dynamics of the surrounding regions are not well understood . in the standard model of agns",
    "@xcite , the region directly outside the accretion disk is the broad line region ( blr ) , where broad line emitting gas moves at velocities of @xmath10 km@xmath11 within the keplerian potential of the black hole .",
    "measurements of the distance of this gas from the central ionizing source in the accretion disk are on the order of light days for lower luminosity agns such as seyfert galaxies and this distance increases with agn luminosity @xcite",
    ".    the geometry and dynamics of the blr can be further constrained by reverberation mapping measurements , where changes in the agn continuum emission are monitored alongside the echo of these same changes in the blr emission lines @xcite .",
    "the time lag @xmath12 between changes in the agn continuum flux and those of the broad emission lines is interpreted as a measure of the average radius of the blr and traditionally measured using the cross - correlation function .",
    "the time lag can then be combined with blr gas velocities @xmath13 taken from the width of the broad emission line to measure a virial product that has the dimensions of black hole mass .",
    "the virial product @xmath14 is related to the true black hole mass @xmath15 by a dimensionless virial factor @xmath1 of order unity that is calibrated by aligning the @xmath16 relations for active and inactive galaxies @xcite .",
    "currently , the uncertainty in mean @xmath1 of @xmath17 dex is the largest uncertainty in reverberation mapped black hole masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the sample of @xmath18 reverberation mapped agns is responsible for calibrating single - epoch @xmath15 estimates applied to much larger samples of agns through the blr - size - to - luminosity relation @xcite , it is important to measure @xmath15 in reverberation mapped agns with as few assumptions and added uncertainties as possible .",
    "there is more information in high quality reverberation mapping data than a single estimate of the time lag .",
    "this is illustrated by analysis of high - quality datasets that show clear velocity - resolved lag structure across the emission line profile in a number of agns .",
    "many of these velocity - resolved lag estimates are consistent with bound orbits in a keplerian potential @xcite , but some show additional kinematic signatures consistent with inflowing or outflowing gas @xcite , where non - gravitational forces may be at work .",
    "much recent work has focused on trying to recover this additional information about the blr geometry and dynamics through more sophisticated analysis techniques .",
    "one method for doing this is to recover the transfer function , which is the distribution of time lags either for the integrated emission line flux or as a function of line - of - sight velocity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this is the approach used in the code memecho , which recovers the transfer function using a flexible parameterization for the transfer function shape and prevents over - fitting by asserting that the solution has a high entropy @xcite .",
    "the main advantage to recovering the transfer function is that it does not require adopting any specific model for the geometry and dynamics of the blr ( see * ? ? ? * for an application of a pixelated method to the reconstruction of the transfer function ) .",
    "this also means that in order to relate features in the recovered transfer function to geometrical and dynamical properties of the blr at a quantitative level , models must eventually be constructed and compared to the transfer function .",
    "members of our team have been working on an alternative approach that involves modeling reverberation mapping data directly to constrain the geometry and dynamics of the blr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while this method requires adopting a specific blr model , the direct modeling approach is quite general and allows for the use of any blr model whose consequences are fast to compute .",
    "the direct modeling method can then be used to determine which theoretical models of the blr geometry and dynamics are preferred by the data . by formulating the method as a problem of bayesian inference , parameter estimation ( within the context of a particular blr model ) , and model selection ( comparison of distinct blr models ) are both possible . in addition to constraining the geometry and dynamics of the broad line emitting gas",
    ", the direct modeling approach allows for independent measurement of the black hole mass without relying on the normalizing factor @xmath1 required by the traditional analysis .",
    "this means that with high - quality reverberation mapping datasets , the uncertainty in black hole masses from dynamical modeling could be substantially less than the @xmath17 dex introduced by assuming a mean value for @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "finally , independent estimates of the black hole mass can be compared to @xmath19 to obtain measurements of @xmath1 for individual agns . with a large enough sample of agns with individual @xmath1 values from direct modeling , we have another method of calculating a mean @xmath1 factor for different agn populations",
    ".    the direct modeling method works by using the continuum flux light curve and a model of the geometry and dynamics of the blr to create a time series of simulated broad emission line profiles .",
    "the simulated line profiles can then be directly compared to the reverberation mapping data line profiles to infer which blr model parameter values best reproduce the data . working with the formalism of bayesian inference , we calculate the joint posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the model parameters . we have focused on developing a simply parametrized phenomenological model of the blr to map the density of broad line emission in position and velocity space .",
    "we have purposefully excluded any constraints from photoionization physics or radiative transfer at this stage , because doing so requires assuming a relation between the distribution of broad line flux emission and the distribution and density of the emitting gas . while extending the model to infer",
    "the physics of the blr gas is certainly of interest , we have found that a flexible simply parameterized model is sufficient to reproduce the line profile shape and variability characteristics in current reverberation mapping spectral datasets as demonstrated for arp 151 and mrk 50 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to a model of the blr , it is necessary to include a model for the agn continuum light curve , since it is necessary to evaluate the agn continuum flux at arbitrary times to produce simulated broad emission line profiles .",
    "we use gaussian processes to interpolate between the continuum light curve datapoints , which allows us to include the uncertainty from the interpolation process into the final uncertainty on the blr model parameters .",
    "the simplified version of gaussian processes that we use is the same as a continuous time first - order autoregressive process ( car(1 ) ) , which has been found to be a good model for larger samples of agn light curves @xcite .",
    "this model for agn continuum variability has been used in a number of other reverberation mapping analyses .",
    "for example , @xcite use a car(1 ) process model for the agn continuum light curve interpolation in their code javelin to measure the time lag between the continuum and an integrated emission line light curve using a top - hat transfer function .",
    "similarly , @xcite use a car(1 ) process model in their code to directly model integrated emission line reverberation mapping data based on the blr model of @xcite .",
    "in this paper we apply the direct modeling method to the lick agn monitoring project ( lamp ) 2008 reverberation mapping dataset @xcite.barth / lamp.html ] the lamp 2008 campaign observed 13 agns using spectroscopy from the shane telescope at lick observatory and johnson _ v _ and _ b _ broad - band photometry from a number of ground - based telescopes .",
    "we focused our direct modeling on the h@xmath0  line of the 9 objects with measurable time lags , using the broad and narrow h@xmath0  emission line components isolated from the stellar continuum and feii lines using spectral decomposition techniques by @xcite .",
    "out of the 9 objects to which we applied our direct modeling method , only 5 objects showed sufficient continuum and line variability to allow for constraints on the geometry and dynamics of the blr . of the five objects with successful direct modeling of the h@xmath0  line presented here , one of the objects , arp 151 , has previous direct modeling results as described by @xcite .",
    "there are two main differences between the direct modeling of @xcite and this work : the first is that we use the spectral decompositions from @xcite instead of @xcite , and the second is that the model of the blr has since been substantially improved .",
    "improvements to the blr model include a new dynamics model and two additional geometry model parameters that add flexibility to the shape of the blr .",
    "in addition , we now model the narrow emission line component of h@xmath0  using the width of the [ ] @xmath20 narrow emission line and calculate the instrumental resolution for each epoch of spectroscopy separately .",
    "our focus in this paper is to apply the direct modeling method to the remainder of the lamp 2008 sample , including reanalysis of arp 151 . in section  [ sect_data ]",
    "we describe the lamp 2008 data used in our analysis . in section  [ sect_model ]",
    "we briefly review our model for the blr with further details to be found in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in section  [ sect_results ]",
    "we present the results of our analysis for the five successfully modeled agns in the lamp 2008 sample .",
    "finally , in section  [ sect_conclusions ] we summarize our results and discuss their implications for future direct modeling work .",
    "all quantities related to properties of the blr are given in the rest frame of the system .",
    "our sample of agns was observed in the lamp reverberation mapping campaign in 2008 .",
    "the first part of the data consists of johnson _ b _ and _ v _ broad - band agn continuum light curves measured using standard aperture photometry techniques , as described by @xcite .",
    "the _ b _ and _ v _ band images were taken at a number of telescopes , including the 30-inch katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) , the 2-m multicolor active galactic nuclei monitoring telescope , the palomar 60-inch telescope , and the 32-inch tenagra ii telescope . for direct modeling of each agn",
    ", we choose to use either the _ b _ or _ v _ band light curve depending on which has more data points , better sampling of variability features , and higher overall variability . in general , the choice of _ b _ or _",
    "v_-band agn continuum light curve does not change our results .",
    "the second part of the data comprises light curves of broad and narrow h@xmath0  line profiles .",
    "measurement of the h@xmath0  line profiles was done in two ways : @xcite isolated the h@xmath0  flux by fitting a local linear continuum underneath the h@xmath0  and oiii lines , while @xcite applied a multi - component fit to isolate the h@xmath0  line from the agn continuum , stellar continuum , and feii emission lines . due to the non - negligible contribution of the stellar continuum and fe emission lines to the five lamp 2008 objects considered here",
    ", we performed direct modeling on the h@xmath0  emission line profiles as measured by @xcite .",
    "the final spectra we use here for modeling include the broad and narrow h@xmath0  line profiles , as well as the spectral decomposition residuals , equivalent to subtracting off all other components from the original spectrum .",
    "the details of the final spectra , including wavelength range used for direct modeling , are given in table  [ table_data ] .",
    "one other important parameter of the spectral dataset is the instrumental resolution , which is used to smooth the simulated emission line profiles .",
    "the instrumental resolution was measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 11 ) for four of the five objects by comparing the [ ] @xmath20 line widths to the values measured by @xcite .",
    "however , there were variations in the [ ] @xmath20 line width over the duration of the reverberation mapping campaign due to small changes in the observing and instrumental conditions .",
    "for this reason , we calculate the instrumental resolution , @xmath21 , for each night independently using the width of the [ ] @xmath20 line from the spectral decomposition by @xcite , @xmath22 , and the intrinsic line width as measured by @xcite , @xmath23 , by subtracting them in quadrature : @xmath24 in order to include the uncertainties in these line width measurements , we consider both the measured and intrinsic widths of the [ ] @xmath20 line to be free parameters with gaussian priors centered on the measured values and with dispersions given by the quoted measurement uncertainties . for the one object ,",

    "we have applied direct modeling techniques to a sample of five agns from the lamp 2008 reverberation mapping campaign in order to constrain the geometry and dynamics of the h@xmath0  blr .",
    "direct modeling also allows us to measure the black hole mass independently and , by comparison with the virial product from traditional reverberation mapping analysis , to measure the virial coefficient or @xmath1 factor for individual agns .",
    "we have also measured the mean @xmath1 factor for our sample , a number that determines the absolute mass scaling for the whole reverberation mapping sample .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the geometry of the blr is consistent with a thick disk .",
    "the radial distribution of h@xmath0  emitting gas is closer to exponential than gaussian and is viewed closer to face - on than edge - on . for arp 151 we find a more detailed geometry of a half - cone , where the h@xmath0  emission is concentrated towards the outer faces of the disk and the disk mid - plane is mostly opaque , similar to the bowl blr geometry proposed by @xcite .",
    "there is preferential h@xmath0  emission from the far side of the blr with respect to the observer , consistent with models where the blr gas is self - shielding .",
    "the dynamics of the blr are consistent with inflowing motions , elliptical orbits , or a combination of both .",
    "specifically , the dynamics of arp 151 are inferred to be inflowing motions , in agreement with velocity - resolved cross - correlation lag measurements @xcite and reconstruction of the transfer function using maximum entropy techniques @xcite .",
    "the black hole masses for the five objects in our sample are @xmath26 for arp 151 , @xmath3 for mrk 1310 , @xmath4 for ngc 5548 , @xmath5 for ngc 6814 , and @xmath6 for sbs 1116 + 583a .",

    "however , we do find a tentative correlation between the ratio of the fwhm to the line dispersion and black hole mass . 8 .   by combining the posterior distributions of @xmath1 for each agn",

    "these values of the mean @xmath1 factor are meant to illustrate the capabilities of the direct modeling approach and should not be used to calibrate black hole masses from reverberation mapping until the sample size is larger and more representative of the overall agn population .",
    "the modeling results presented here demonstrate the capabilities of the direct modeling approach and show that significant information about the blr geometry and dynamics is encoded in high - quality reverberation mapping datasets .",
    "we find that the five agns in our sample have similar geometric and kinematic features , suggesting that the blr may also be similar in other seyfert 1 galaxies with low luminosities , black hole masses of @xmath43 , and small eddington ratios . by applying the direct modeling approach to a larger sample of agns",
    ", we can determine if and how the properties of the blr might change with increasing luminosity , accretion rate , and black hole mass .",
    "our results also demonstrate the feasibility of measuring black hole masses independently of the @xmath1 factor in seyfert 1 galaxies . for the reverberation mapping datasets shown here",
    ", black hole masses can be constrained to @xmath44 dex uncertainty depending upon data quality and degeneracy of the black hole mass with the geometrical properties of the blr , such as inclination angle of the observer and opening angle of the disk .",
    "in addition , the blr kinematics inferred for our sample are consistent with bound orbits , suggesting that the h@xmath0-emitting blr is not significantly affected by disk winds or outflows .",
    "this is an important consistency check for reverberation mapped black hole masses because they are measured by assuming the blr gas orbits are dominated by the gravity of the black hole .",
    "future versions of our blr model will explore the issue of non - gravitational forces further and relate broad line emission to the properties of the emitting gas by incorporating the results of photoionization physics .",

    "the fraction of point particles with velocities drawn from the distribution centered around the circular orbit value is given by @xmath78 , which has a uniform prior between 0 and 1 .",
    "the remaining point particles have velocities drawn from the distribution centered around either the radial inflowing or outflowing escape velocity values , where @xmath79 corresponds to the inflowing distribution and @xmath80 corresponds to the outflowing distribution , and where @xmath81 has a uniform prior between 0 and 1 .",
    "the inflow / outflow - centered distributions can also be rotated by an angle @xmath82 towards the circular orbit - centered distribution , where @xmath82 has a uniform prior between 0 and 90 degrees .",
    "finally , we include additional macroturbulent velocities given by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the circular orbit velocity and @xmath85 is the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution from which a random macroturbulent velocity component is drawn .",

    "for each of the five agns in our sample , we can compute the posterior distribution for the @xmath1 factor that relates the black hole mass to either the velocity dispersion or the fwhm of the broad emission line . here",
    "we describe the method used to constrain the distribution of @xmath1 values from the modelling results ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for examples using the same approach ) .",
    "consider a collection of @xmath87 objects , each of which has a property @xmath69 which we infer from data @xmath88 .",
    "modelling each object yields a posterior distribution @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the prior used in the modelling , which is the same for each object . in practice , since we are using mcmc , the posterior distributions @xmath91 are represented computationally by samples . in our particular application , @xmath92 .",
    "unfortunately , the use of the @xmath90 prior for each object implies we do not expect the objects to be clustered around a typical @xmath69 value .",
    "if we did expect such clustering , we should have used a different prior for the @xmath93 , such as a normal distribution : @xmath94\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the prior , conditional on two new hyperparameters describing the typical value @xmath95 that the objects are clustered around , and the scatter @xmath96 . to complete the inference we also need to assign a prior to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which we take to be vague . using this model",

    "alternatively the posterior distribution for the _ actual _ mean @xmath97 could be calculated , but the former approach allows for generalisation beyond the current sample .",
