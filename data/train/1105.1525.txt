    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) 4u 1820 - 30 is located in the core of the globular cluster ngc 6624 ( giacconi et al .",
    "1974 ) . using optical observations the distance",
    "is estimated to be @xmath2 kpc ( kuulkers et al .",
    "thermo - nuclear x - ray bursts ( so - called type  i x - ray bursts , see , e.g. , lewin , van paradijs & taam 1993 , strohmayer & bildsten 2006 , for reviews ) from this source were discovered by grindlay et al . ( 1976 ) .",
    "4u 1820 - 30 has an extremely short binary orbital period of 685 sec ( stella , priedhorsky & white 1987 ) .",
    "such a short orbital period and the x - ray burst activity imply that it is a low - mass binary system with a @xmath3 secondary ( donor ) star orbiting a neutron star .",
    "the donor is most probably a helium white dwarf ( rappaport et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "almost all of the x - ray bursts from 4u 1820 - 30 release so much energy , that the surface luminosity of the neutron star reaches the eddington limit ( see vacca et al .",
    "1986 , haberl et al .",
    "1987 , kuulkers et al .",
    "2003 , galloway et al .",
    "the atmosphere then expands due to radiation pressure and the photospheric radius increases by a factor of up to @xmath4 . at the time of expansion and subsequent contraction the x - ray luminosity of 4u 1820 - 30",
    "is expected to remain almost constant near the eddington limit .",
    "such a scenario implies that at first the effective temperature @xmath5 of the compact star decreases when the radius increases . at the subsequent stage ,",
    "the radius decreases and the @xmath5 increases .",
    "x - ray spectra taken during such strong burst can be used to estimate mass and radius for the compact star in 4u 1820 - 30 , and hence , for determining the equation of state ( eos ) for ultradense matter hidden in the stellar interior ( cf .",
    "haberl et al .",
    "1987 ; lewin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "measurements of masses and radii of neutron stars are necessary for better understanding of the populations of all stellar objects and the latest stages of stellar evolution .",
    "moreover , it is possible that some of them are made out of strange matter with the equation of state ( eos ) different than that for neutrons . in such a case mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 of the compact star",
    "can be apparently lower than for a neutron star ( see e.g. haensel et al .",
    "mass and radius determination for a compact star is understood as an intermediate step to constrain eos in many recent papers ( zel 2006 ; lattimer & prakash 2007 for example ) .    at present , masses and radii of weakly magnetized compact stars in x - ray burst sources",
    "are rather poorly constrained , due to several reasons .",
    "first , usually there exists several sources of x - ray emission contributing to the total flux : thermonuclear explosions in the stellar envelope , accretion disk and accretion stream , and the transition layer between disk and the stellar surface .",
    "second , observed satellite x - ray spectra are of poor quality and their interpretation with spectral fitting software is ambiguous .",
    "third , available models of x - ray emission ( and model atmospheres of hot compact stars ) mostly are schematic and inadequate for fitting of non - planckian spectra .",
    "the advantage of this work is that we use much more sophisticated model spectra than those used in previous papers ( see the last paragraph of section 2 and the beginning of section 4 ) .",
    "our analysis uses published _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) proportional counter array ( pca ) x - ray spectral data of this source ( kuulkers et al .",
    "2003 ) , which were obtained during a strong burst just after the phase corresponding to the maximum effective temperature @xmath5 .",
    "we assume , that the radius of the neutron star photosphere had decreased to its normal value .",
    "the cooling phase had just started , but the bolometric ( x - ray ) luminosity is still very close to the eddington luminosity .    at first , we determined the surface gravity @xmath8 and the surface gravitational redshift @xmath9 for 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "both parameters were constrained by the best fits of the observed spectra to grids of hundreds of theoretical x - ray spectra of hot neutron stars . finally , the mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 of the compact object were determined from simple algebraic relations corresponding to a non - rotating star and the schwarzschild metric ( majczyna & madej 2005 ) .",
    "rotational distortion of a compact star depends both on the rate of rotation and details of its internal structure including the eos .",
    "none of them are known a priori .",
    "also there are no available models of flattened compact stars .",
    "therefore , assumption of a nonrotating star is the only practical approximation for our research .",
    "we also assume that the burst emission from the source is isotropic .",
    "the assumption means that the eruption exhibits spherical symmetry , and anisotropy caused by the disk was neglected .",
    "moreover , properties of the accretion disk ( e.g. its thickness ) , possible existence of the accretion disk corona and the unknown inclination angle of the disk do not alter the observed x - ray spectrum by assumption .",
    "grids of helium - dominated model atmospheres and x - ray spectra of hot neutron star were computed with the atm21 code , which computes model atmospheres with the account of compton scattering on free electrons .",
    "the code takes into account angle - averaged compton scattering of x - ray photons with initial energies approaching the electron rest mass .",
    "our models atmospheres were computed with rich set of bound - free and free - free energy - dependent opacities .",
    "a detailed description of the equations and numerical methods were given in a long series of earlier papers ( madej 1991a , b ; joss and madej 2001 ; madej , joss and raska 2004 ; majczyna et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "our analysis makes use of the series of 113 x - ray spectra taken during a strong burst from 4u 1820 - 30 recorded by the pca onboard the _ rxte _ satellite on ut 1997 may 2 , which started at 17:32:45 .",
    "the burst spectra are at a 0.25 sec time resolution , and are numbered from 5 to 120 .",
    "they are corrected for deadtime .",
    "all pcus were on during the observation .",
    "we subtracted the pre - burst persistent emission from the burst emission .",
    "the whole sequence of spectra was described and analyzed in detail in the paper by kuulkers et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for this paper we took into account the latest response matrix , using marfrmf version 3.2.6 .    for our analysis",
    "we have chosen only 2 spectra of that series , which correspond to the phase of the burst just after the maximum blackbody temperature @xmath10 , see kuulkers et al .",
    "these spectra are labeled no .",
    "21 and 22 .",
    "the single burst of 4u 1820 - 30 was chosen as trial and validation of the method .",
    "model atmospheres and theoretical spectra of our grid were parametrized by     : :    effective temperature @xmath11 in the range    @xmath12 k in steps of    @xmath13 , and  : :    decimal logarithm of gravitational acceleration in the atmosphere of a    neutron star , @xmath8 .",
    "the lowest gravity model of    @xmath14 just touches the critical gravity , when    the atmosphere loses hydrostatic equilibrium ( models at    @xmath8 equal to @xmath15 or    less were dynamically unstable ) .",
    "the highest gravity equals to    @xmath16 for all effective temperatures    @xmath11 .",
    "e.g. for    @xmath17 k we precomputed a set of    theoretical spectra corresponding to @xmath18 ,    @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ,    @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and    @xmath25 .",
    "our grid consists of 288 models .",
    "we assumed for all analyzed spectra , that the photospheric radius of the compact object has already decreased to its normal value .",
    "the cooling phase has just started , but the bolometric luminosity is still close to the eddington luminosity . in this",
    "regime model atmospheres and their x - ray spectra are more sensitive for changes of both the effective temperature @xmath11 and gravity @xmath8 .",
    "the farther off the eddington luminosity , the less accurate is our method of determining both parameters of the compact star . in practice , it turned out that we can use it only for the spectra no .",
    "21 and 22 . to make sure that our minimum of @xmath26 is a global , we have used an extensive grid of models .    for a given @xmath11",
    "calculated x - ray spectra exhibit peak fluxes always at an energy higher than the blackbody of the same temperature .",
    "it is a well - known effect that the @xmath10 from black - body fits to the burst spectra ( called color temperature @xmath27 ) are always greater than @xmath5 . in other words , color factor @xmath28 ( madej 1974 ; lewin et al .",
    "1993 ; shaposhnikov & titarchuk 2004 ) .",
    "we draw attention of the reader to the fact that this difference is implicitly taken into account in our calculated burst spectra .",
    "the important issue is the choice of the chemical composition of the model atmospheres .",
    "we know that the material accreted by the neutron star is dominated by helium with small amounts of hydrogen ( cumming 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , at the phase of a burst just after the maximum luminosity some ashes from nuclear burning are still exposed at the neutron star surface . that matter was ejected by the radiation driven wind during the phase of radius expansion ( weinberg , bildsten & schatz 2006 ) .",
    "however , we accepted a rather simple chemical composition for our grids of model atmospheres , i.e. , we assumed helium with small amounts of iron . in this way",
    "iron was used as the  average metal  and replaced a mixture of heavy elements which must be created during a thermonuclear burst .",
    "we were able to constrain the iron abundance by estimating the quality of the trial fits , which was given by the value of @xmath26 for 1 degree of freedom.we tested fits to the grid of almost pure helium atmosphere spectra with very small amount of hydrogen and to few grids of model atmospheres adding iron of various abundance .",
    "( hydrogen must be included in the atm21 input data set due to numerical reasons . ) for the final fitting we used the grid of model atmospheres and spectra computed for the best chemical composition , as shown in table 1 .",
    "all fits of the observed x - ray spectra to the numerical models depend on the following parameters :     : :    hydrogen column density @xmath29 .",
    "we assumed that    @xmath29 is identical for all spectra and equals to    @xmath30 @xmath31    ( see kuulkers et al .",

    "the gravitational redshift is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the neutron star mass , @xmath7 is the radius measured on the neutron star surface , @xmath48 denotes the speed of light .",

    "this is a widely accepted assumption , that both radii are equal at the touchdown phase of strong x - ray bursts with radius expansion .",

    "in this paper we presented a new method to determine the mass and radius of the compact object in type  i x - ray burst sources . we analyzed x - ray spectra of the burster 4u 1820 - 30 in phases when the luminosity of the source is still close to the eddington luminosity and the compact star photosphere returned close to its normal size after radius expansion .",
    "the observed x - ray spectra were fitted to grids of theoretical spectra of model atmospheres in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium computed with the precise treatment of compton scattering on free electrons .",
    "blackbody fits allow us to determine radius only for the burster of known distance . using our method",
    "we may obtain not only radius but also mass of the neutron star simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , our @xmath6 and @xmath7 determinations are not directly dependent on the distance to the source .",

    "this is a great advantage over blackbody fits .    using our method , we constrained the mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 km for the compact star in 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "mass and radius of the compact star in 4u 1820 - 30 obtained in this paper are close to the canonical mass @xmath59 and radius @xmath60 km of neutron star ( see the monograph by haensel , potekhin & yakovlev ( 2007 ) ) .",

    "it is thought that the highest observed qpo frequency from 4u 1820 - 30 is the marginally stable orbit frequency , therefore , it implied the estimated mass of @xmath64 ( smale , zhang & white 1997 ) .",

    "mass and radius could be eventually obtained from set algebraic equations involving distance to 4u 1820 - 30 and the color correction factor @xmath67 , the latter was known from model atmosphere calculations .",
    "our approach lies in the fact that shapes of both observed and numerical spectra differ from shape of the blackbody .",

    "no informations on the distance , bolometric flux or color factors were applied here .",
