    "the coupling and decoupling of each qubit from its cavity can be achieved by prior adjustment of the qubit level spacings .",
    "for instance , the level spacings of superconducting qubits can be rapidly adjusted by varying external control parameters ( e.g. , magnetic flux applied to the superconducting loop of a superconducting phase , transmon , xmon or flux qubit ; see , e.g. ,  [ 38 - 41 ] ) ; the level spacings of nv centers can be readily adjusted by changing the external magnetic field applied along the crystalline axis of each nv center [ 42,43 ] ; and the level spacings of atoms / quantum dots can be adjusted by changing the voltage on the electrodes around each atom / quantum dot [ 44 ] .",

    "<S> there are two types of significant multiqubit gates , i.e. , multiqubit gates with multiple control qubits acting on a single target qubit  [ 1 - 6 ] , and multiqubit gates with a single qubit simultaneously controlling multiple target qubits  [ 7 ] . </S>",
