    "massless matter charged under a non - abelian gauge group is known to arise in m - theory compactified on @xmath0 in two ways , both of which are geometric in origin : by the existence of boundaries in the compactification manifold ( e.g. hoava - witten theory @xcite ) or by the existence of isolated ( co - dimension seven ) enhancements of co - dimension four singularities @xcite . in this paper , we will be interested in the latter .",
    "the description of how singularities in the compactification manifold can give rise to gauge theory and massless matter representations is known as geometrical engineering and has applications to type iia string theory and f - theory as well @xcite .",
    "the singular geometries giving rise to most desirable phenomenological matter representations are well known in the literature ( see e.g @xcite ) . until recently , however , it was hard to see how the framework of geometrical engineering itself could be used to motivate phenomenological models .",
    "the reason is that although one can describe the local geometry giving rise to almost any desirable matter representation , a phenomenological model would seem to require dozens of these isolated singularities . without duality to a concrete string construction , there appeared to be little to motivate the numbers , types , and relative positions of all the singularities required .",
    "indeed , simply engineering a manifold to give rise to @xmath2 gauge theory with one enhanced singularity for every known ( and anticipated ) particle of the standard model would seem to be wishful thinking at best , and arbitrary worst  why only those singularities ? and why at those relative positions ?",
    "a possible way to motivate the many singularities required to engineer the standard model could be a geometric analogue of grand unification @xcite . in the context of type iia",
    "string theory , we showed in @xcite how a geometrically - engineered @xmath3 model with @xmath4 gauge theory and a single @xmath5-type conical singularity could be deformed into a geometrically - engineered model with @xmath2 gauge theory with 35 isolated conical singularities of the types required to reproduce three families .",
    "the numbers and types of singularities of the ` unfolded ' model  and in particular that three families emerges  is a consequence of group theory and algebraic geometry alone . and their relative locations , which determine the superpotential , are set by the values of the moduli which deform the initial , maximally singular geometry .",
    "this then is the motivation underlying our present discussion : the possibility that the many disparate singularities required for the standard model matter fields could arise from the ` unfolding ' of a manifold engineered to give rise to some level of grand unification . in @xcite",
    "we showed how this could be realized concretely in the context of type iia string theory ( and to some extent in f - theory ) .",
    "but a concrete demonstration that this story could be realized in m - theory was lacking . in this paper , we fill in this gap by showing explicitly how local , @xmath0-manifolds engineered to give rise to @xmath1 representations in m - theory can be smoothly deformed into those with multiple , isolated conical singularities giving rise to @xmath2 matter representations .",
    "the basic ingredients and necessary tools are well known in the literature and the story we present here is in many ways a natural extension of traditional geometrical engineering .",
    "what is new in our present work is the application of these well - known tools used to describe the local geometry about a _",
    "conical singularity of a given type to now also describe the local geometry about an _ entire collection of disparate conical singularities _ which arise by the unfolding of a more singular ( more unified ) initial geometry . and",
    "this is done by a geometric analogue to unified symmetry breaking .",
    "there are several motivations for studying these ` unfolded geometries ' beyond those of natural esthetics .",
    "first , the framework allows us to describe concretely the total geometry about most or all of the phenomenologically relevant structures in the manifold . and",
    "the local structure that emerges can be very constrained : all of the relative positions of disparate singularities are specified in terms or a small number of deformation moduli  and",
    "this greatly reduces the arbitrariness of the form of the superpotential , for example : insisting on a local , unfolded perspective puts many restrictions on the range of possible models . and",
    "not unimportantly , the locality of these constructions allows us to study possible phenomenological predictions of m - theory before solving all of quantum gravity , much in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we will limit ourselves in this paper to the example of unfolding matter representations of @xmath1 into those of @xmath2 .",
    "this is done both as a proof of concept of the over - arching idea , and to serve as a pedagogical example of the methods and tools involved .",
    "it turns out that unfolding @xmath1 representations in m - theory is just simple enough  but barely so  that we can guess the necessary deformed geometry and verify our guesses by inspection .",
    "a more sophisticated approach would be required to systematically study the unfolding of more unified singularities .",
    "in particular , this means that the more phenomenologically appealing example of unfolding three families out of an isolated @xmath5-type singularity ( as done in @xcite in type iia and f - theory ) must wait for a future work .    in section [ geoengin ] , we review the basic ingredients of geometrical engineering in m - theory and describe the local geometries which give rise to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 representations of @xmath1 . in section [ unfold ]",
    "we describe how to deform these such that the resulting geometry gives rise to @xmath2 gauge theory ; when this is done , we find that the single singularities giving rise to @xmath1 representations are ` broken apart ' into separated singularities producing their corresponding standard model particle content .",
    "geometrical engineering in m - theory is qualitatively the same as that in type iia . in both",
    ", gauge theory arises via co - dimension four singular surfaces in the compactification manifold , and charged matter arises if there are _ isolated _ points on these surfaces where the singularity is enhanced .",
    "the way in which the singularity is enhanced determines the representation that results .",
    "the only difference between engineering in m - theory and type iia is the dimension of the singular surfaces giving rise to gauge theory : in type iia they are two - dimensional while in m - theory they are three - dimensional .",
    "but this difference does have an important consequence : it makes it possible to differentiate the geometry giving rise to a representation and its complex conjugate .",
    "that is , geometrical engineering in m - theory results in manifestly chiral representations @xcite .    at any point along the three - dimensional surface of one of these singularities ,",
    "the geometry is locally equivalent to an ade - type singularity , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . ] .",
    "if the type of ade singularity were the same for every point of three - dimensional surface , then the @xmath0-compactification manifold would give rise to pure gauge theory of the corresponding type .",
    "conveniently , ade singularities are named according to the gauge theory that results .    in order to describe locations where these singularities are enhanced",
    ", we should consider our compactification manifold as a fibration of @xmath10 surfaces containing ade singularities over a three - dimensional base , say @xmath11 , which is locally coordinatized by a real three - vector @xmath12 .",
    "there must be isolated points over which the type of fibre is enhanced by one rank .",
    "looking at this from the point of view of the enhanced fibre , what is needed is a three - dimensional space of deformations of an ade singularity of one type into another of lesser rank .",
    "( in @xcite , we needed the singularities to be enhanced only at isolated points over a two - dimensional base space . by defining the ade singularities as singular hyper - surfaces in @xmath13",
    ", we were able to use one - complex dimensional complex structure deformations to achieve local enhancements .",
    "this language allowed us to make use of some powerful mathematical knowledge about two - dimensional deformations of ade singularities ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is not the right language in which to discuss the three - dimensional deformations required for m - theory . )",
    "the description of ade singularities which makes manifest the three - dimensional nature of their resolutions was given by kronheimer in @xcite .",
    "it was this framework that acharya and witten used in @xcite to describe the local geometry of @xmath0-manifolds engineered to give rise to charged matter for a number of example representations .",
    "their work was extended by berglund and brandhuber in @xcite to include more examples , and the suggestion of multiply unfolding these geometries .",
    "in many ways , our present paper is a natural extension and application of the ideas expressed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a prerequisite for describing a @xmath0-manifold as a fibration of ade singularities over @xmath11 is an adequate description of the ade fibres themselves .",
    "we have already pointed out that their description in terms of complex structure alone will not be adequate for our present purposes .",
    "rather , we will use kronheimer s construction of ade singularities as hyper - khler quotients @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 singularities are both the easiest to describe and can also be the starting point to construct @xmath15 and @xmath9 singularities .",
    "an @xmath16 singularity is locally equivalent to @xmath17 , which is locally equivalent to the surface of solutions to @xmath18 in @xmath13 . rather than these descriptions",
    ", however , we choose to view this space as the vacuum manifold of a particular linear sigma model of @xmath19 hypermultiplets @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with gauge group @xmath22 where under the @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath20 has charge @xmath25 , @xmath26 has charge @xmath27 , and other hypermultiplets are neutral .",
    "the vacuum manifold is obtained by imposing all the fayet - iliopoulos d / f - term constraints ( setting them to zero ) and taking an ordinary quotient by @xmath28 .",
    "we will denote the scalars of @xmath20 by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , and let @xmath31 denote the space spanned by @xmath32 and @xmath33 to highlight its quaternionic structure . ] .",
    "the vacuum of this linear sigma model will be called @xmath34 .",
    "we will now show that @xmath34 is in fact an @xmath14 singularity .",
    "notice first that the dimension is correct : start with @xmath35 dimensions of @xmath36 ; then , applying the d / f - term constraints reduces this by @xmath37 ; and dividing by @xmath28 reduces by another @xmath38 , yielding @xmath39 . to show that the space is equivalent to the surface @xmath18 will require some additional notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "first , recall that the fayet - iliopoulos d / f - terms are linear combinations of the moment maps , which we will write @xmath40 notice that the @xmath24-charges of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are opposite . in this notation , and with the @xmath24-charge assignments described above , the d / f - term for the @xmath23 @xmath24 can be written @xmath41    the vanishing of all the d / f - terms therefore implies the condition that @xmath42 for any @xmath43 .",
    "this suggests that we introduce the following @xmath28-invariant variables @xmath44 because these variables are related by @xmath18 , it is clear that the space @xmath34 is indeed equivalent to an @xmath14 singularity .",
    "the three - dimensional deformations of the singularity are then found by allowing a linear combination of the d / f - terms to be non - vanishing .      following the discussion in @xcite",
    ", we will consider the @xmath15 singularity to be a @xmath45-orbifold of an @xmath46 singularity . that this is the right geometry to consider",
    "is made clear by duality to type iia : recall that geometrically engineered models in m - theory are dual to intersecting d - brane models in type iia ; with this in mind , the geometry in m - theory giving rise to @xmath15 gauge theory must dimensionally reduce to a theory with @xmath47 stacked d - branes together with an @xmath48-plane to generate @xmath15 gauge theory in type iia ; the presence of the @xmath48-plane in type iia suggests that an appropriate @xmath45-orbifold of an @xmath46 singularity will yield the desired geometry .",
    "let us start with an @xmath46 singularity as described above : @xmath49 .",
    "following @xcite , let the action of @xmath50 be generated by @xmath51or , equivalently , using the notation introduced in equation ( [ xyz ] ) , @xmath52    clearly @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not @xmath55-invariant variables . however , they can easily be combined into the related quantities @xmath56 which are indeed seen to be @xmath55-invariant .",
    "furthermore , they are related by the equation @xmath57 which is visibly the defining equation of an @xmath15 singularity .",
    "therefore , @xmath58/\\mathbb{z}_2 $ ] is in indeed the desired geometry .",
    "the deformations of an @xmath15 singularity are those of the covering space @xmath46 that are @xmath45-invariant .",
    "+      the above discussion may at first seem unnecessarily cumbersome .",
    "the work will pay off , however , when we observe that it naturally allows for the construction of @xmath0-manifolds with the isolated singularities required to give rise to massless charged matter representations .",
    "this was an essential insight of acharya and witten in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "if one of the @xmath24 factors in @xmath28 used above were ignored , say @xmath59 , then @xmath60 would be a hyper - khler , eight - dimensional manifold . by taking a normal quotient of this by @xmath61 in such a way that @xmath61 commutes with the three complex structures of @xmath60 , the resulting space @xmath62",
    "would be a seven - fold , inheriting a @xmath0-structure from the hyper - khler structure .    to be more precise ,",
    "let @xmath11 be some three - dimensional base space which is locally coordinatized by @xmath63 , the d / f - term of @xmath61 .",
    "clearly any @xmath64constant slice through @xmath62 will be four - dimensional and have singularities corresponding to those generated by the other @xmath24 factors .",
    "it is easy to appreciate that when @xmath65 the singularity is simply the original @xmath14 singularity .",
    "however , for non - vanishing @xmath63 , the singularity is softened by one - rank .",
    "this can be understood as using @xmath66 to blow - up one of the nodes of the dynkin diagram for @xmath14 .    as described in @xcite ,",
    "if the @xmath67 @xmath24 is taken out of @xmath28 and its d / f - term is used to coordinatize a local patch on @xmath11 , then @xmath68 gauge theory results with chiral matter in the @xmath69 representation , localized at a single point on @xmath11at @xmath70 .",
    "the geometry can be shown to be a cone over @xmath71 .",
    "we will not need to discuss this level of detail , however , in our examples below .",
    "we have all the tools necessary to describe the engineering of a @xmath6 of @xmath1 . recalling that this representation results from the resolution @xmath72 , it is clear that we would like to start with the hyper - khler quotient description of an @xmath73 singularity , and allow one of the d / f - terms to coordinatize a region of the base space @xmath11 .",
    "to reiterate both the concepts involved and our notation , recall that the @xmath73 singularity is viewed as the vacuum manifold @xmath74 of the linear sigma model of @xmath75 hyperrmultiplets @xmath20 , @xmath76whose scalars are denoted @xmath29that are charged under @xmath77 as described in section [ geoengin ] .",
    "if we instead consider @xmath78 gauge theory , then the geometry would have given rise to a @xmath79 of @xmath1 .",
    "] , then the manifold @xmath80 is seven - dimensional , and is considered the fibration of ade singularities over a base @xmath11 that is coordinatized by the d / f - term of @xmath81    to see that the geometry corresponds to the resolution @xmath72 , let us write the d / f - term are related by an @xmath82 symmetry and so there is nothing special about this choice of paramterization . ] @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "then using the same definitions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 as in equation ( [ xyz ] ) , the definition of @xmath86 tells us that @xmath87 so that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related via @xmath88 .",
    "clearly this is the geometry we desired : at @xmath89 the fibre is @xmath73 and at any @xmath90 it is @xmath1 .",
    "recall that a @xmath7 of @xmath1 arises via the resolution @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , we must deform an @xmath92 singularity so as to give rise to @xmath1 over a generic point on the base space @xmath11 .",
    "as we described above , the @xmath92 singularity is described as a @xmath45-orbifold of an @xmath93 singularity ; and its resolutions are those of the @xmath93 cover which are invariant under @xmath45 . using the now ` canonical ' labelling conventions to describe the @xmath93 singularity ,",
    "let us define @xmath94 .",
    "then the orbifolded hyper - khler quotient @xmath95/\\mathbb{z}_2 $ ] is a seven - dimensional manifold which we will view as a fibration over a space parameterized by @xmath86 , the d / f - term for @xmath96 , such that for @xmath90 the fibres are @xmath1 and when @xmath89 the singularity is enhanced to @xmath92 .",
    "to demonstrate this claim , we will construct the complex structure of the fibres as we did for the @xmath6 representation .",
    "again , we will use the same notation as above : @xmath97 we will parameterize the d / f - term of @xmath96 almost exactly as we did in equation ( [ resolvet ] ) , but with a factor of 2 inserted for future notational simplicity : @xmath98 recall that the @xmath45 action defining the orbifold is generated by @xmath99 .",
    "notice also that under @xmath55 , @xmath100 .",
    "because the definition of the hyper - khler quotient giving the covering @xmath93 singularity implies that the d / f - terms of @xmath101 all vanish , we see that @xmath102 and @xmath103 therefore , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related by @xmath104 where we have introduced the new variable @xmath105 .",
    "notice that because both @xmath54 and @xmath106 are odd under @xmath55 , so is @xmath107 .",
    "of course , these variables are still not invariant under the action of @xmath45 .",
    "this is largely remedied by defining the new variables as defined here is _ not _ invariant under @xmath45 .",
    "however , this does not pose any problems because equation ( [ 10ofsu5 ] ) , which relates @xmath108 and @xmath109 , is itself invariant under @xmath45 . ]",
    "@xmath110 by analogy to equation ( [ xyz ] ) above .",
    "they are related by the identity @xmath111 this defining equation is invariant under the action of @xmath45 and so the surface of solutions to this equation in @xmath13 is isomorphic to the fibre over @xmath86 ( for vanishing @xmath112 )",
    ". equation ( [ 10ofsu5 ] ) should be recognized as precisely the deformation @xmath113 giving rise to a massless @xmath7 of @xmath1 ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "in our discussions above , only one d / f - term of the linear sigma model was considered as potentially acquire a non - zero value ; and this d / f - term was given a special interpretation as parameterizing the singular , four - dimensional fibres over a three dimensional base @xmath11 .",
    "as described analogously in @xcite , if however one of these parameters were allowed to be non - vanishing _ independent of the location on @xmath11 _ , the type of singularity over the whole of @xmath11 would reduce in rank  corresponding to ` unfolding ' the manifold into one with less symmetry .",
    "when isolated enhanced singularities are present , they also reduce in rank but remain locations of enhanced singularity relative to the singularity of the generic fibre over @xmath11 . in general",
    ", the conical , enhanced singularities giving rise to charged matter will unfold into a collection of disparate singularities giving rise to the representations which would have resulted from ordinary symmetry breaking .",
    "in this section we will make this idea explicit by unfolding the singularities giving rise to @xmath1 matter representations into their corresponding representations of @xmath2 .",
    "let us describe how the conical singularity engineered in section [ 5ofsu5 ] can be unfolded into the standard model . to do this",
    ", we must set the d / f - term of one ( or more ) of the other @xmath115 s to some constant value , independent of the location @xmath86 on the base @xmath11 , so that the generic fibre over @xmath86 is @xmath2 .",
    "thinking about the linear sigma model as a quiver theory , it is easy to see which @xmath24 should be resolved . indeed",
    ", the resolution of either @xmath116 or @xmath117 would result in @xmath2 singularities in the generic fibre ; a flip of a coin chose @xmath116 for us .",
    "let us define @xmath118 .",
    "the vacuum manifold of the linear sigma model of the @xmath75 hypermultiplets @xmath119denoted @xmath120is then a twelve - dimensional hyper - khler manifold . by quotienting by @xmath116 and @xmath96",
    ", we then obtain the ten - dimensional hyper - khler quotient @xmath121 . the d / f - terms of the two `",
    "resolved ' @xmath24 s parameterize a six - dimensional base over which are fibred ade singularities .",
    "we will continue to use @xmath122 to parameterize the fibres over @xmath11 , while we will use to parameterize deformations of all the fibres over @xmath11 independent of @xmath123 .    using the variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 as defined in equation ( [ xyz ] ) , we see that they are now related by @xmath124 this allows us to conclude directly that the generic fibre over @xmath11 has both an @xmath125 and an @xmath82 singularity , giving rise to @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "furthermore , we see that when @xmath126 , the singularity is enhanced to @xmath127 giving rise to matter in the @xmath128 representation of @xmath2 ; and at @xmath129 the singularity is enhanced to @xmath130 giving rise to matter in the @xmath131 representation . a cartoon of the fibration is shown in figure [ unfolding_a_5 ] .",
    "therefore , we have explicitly shown that the enhanced , conical singularity of a @xmath0-manifold giving rise to a massless @xmath6 of @xmath1 can be smoothly deformed into two enhanced conical singularities , giving rise to matter in the @xmath128 and @xmath131 representations of @xmath2 gauge theory .",
    "recall that because the @xmath92 singularity was constructed as a @xmath45-orbifold of an @xmath93 singularity , we should describe the resolutions of @xmath92 in terms of the resolutions of its cover - space @xmath93 which are invariant under the action of @xmath45 .",
    "this makes it slightly harder to guess which @xmath24 s to resolve . indeed , in the spirit of the multiple unfoldings described in @xcite",
    ", we will find that the resolution must be a linear combination of d / f - terms from two different @xmath24 s .",
    "rather than motivating the resolution as we did above , we will simply state the answer and verify that it does indeed produce the desired structure .    using the language and notation of section [ secso10 ] ,",
    "let @xmath133 then the ( orbifolded ) hyper - khler quotient @xmath134/\\mathbb{z}_2,\\ ] ] is a thirteen - dimensional manifold where the d / f - terms of the three resolved @xmath24 s parameterize a family of ade singularities .",
    "as in section [ secso10 ] we will use @xmath135 to parameterize the fibres over the three - dimensional base @xmath11 .",
    "the d / f - terms for @xmath117 and @xmath136 will be related to one another by @xmath137 we will show that if @xmath138 is takes on a non - zero value  independent of the location on @xmath11then the manifold will be found to give rise to gauge theory with the singularities supporting matter in the @xmath139 , @xmath128 and @xmath140 representations of @xmath2 .    using the now familiar definitions of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and continuing to let @xmath143 , we see that here they are related by @xmath144 where we have introduced the variable @xmath145 . notice that @xmath107 is odd under the action of @xmath55 .",
    "proceeding as we did in section [ secso10 ] , we introduce the variables @xmath146 and we find that these new variables are related by ,    @xmath147    this equation is invariant under the action of @xmath45 and so therefore describes the fibre over a point @xmath123 ( for vanishing @xmath112 ) .",
    "this is precisely the same complex structure encountered in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we see that for fixed @xmath148 , the generic fibre over @xmath123 is simply @xmath2 , and there are three isolated places in @xmath11 where the singularity is enhanced : at @xmath149 and @xmath150 there are enhancements of the singularities giving rise to matter in @xmath128 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 representations of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the fibrtion of the unfolded geometry is illustrated in figure [ unfolding_a_10 ] .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the basic ideas of @xcite have a concrete realization in m - theory .",
    "this is in some sense a proof of concept that also in m - theory , geometrically - engineered grand unified models can be unfolded into ones with less gauge symmetry . and",
    "although we have presented only the simplest example of interest , we have every reason to suspect that all the structure described in @xcite giving rise to three families can also be realized in m - theory",
    ".    we should clarify that here , like in @xcite , there is no clear sense in which the traditional notion of ` symmetry breaking ' is taking place : because we do not yet understand the dynamics which control and set the values of the parameters unfolding the geometry , it is nt at all obvious that ` higgsing ' makes dynamical sense here . from a rather conservative point of view , our work merely provides a motivation for a possible local origin of the three families of the standard model ( extended similarly to @xmath151 models ) .",
    "one potentially interesting feature of this motivating picture is that the relative locations of the diverse conical singularities can be related to one another by the parameters which deform the more unified geometry . and because the geometric structures giving rise to the standard model matter content are all local in nature",
    ", this may allow string phenomenologists to separate the discussion of global stability from one of phenomenology .",
    "the general philosophy behind our local , geometric origin of the three families is quite similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "a strength of this approach is that one can motivate and in principle describe the local geometries of at least one class of @xmath0-manifolds that have all the structure necessary to have @xmath2 gauge theory with three families at low energy .",
    "being a local description of the compactification manifold , however , this picture allows for a number of potential criticisms . recall that we have only described a single coordinate patch along the base space @xmath11 , which we have taken to be @xmath152 .",
    "this surely can not be the whole story : if @xmath11 were @xmath152 , not only would the resulting theory have no gravity ( @xmath153 by non - compactness ) , but it would effectively have no gauge theory either ( @xmath154 ) : the low - energy gauge coupling is set by @xmath155 .",
    "so clearly the local patch of @xmath11 which we describe must be glued into a compact three - fold . and while we are able to motivate much of the low energy physics ",
    "three families , an interesting superpotential , etc.without knowledge of the global topology of @xmath11 , we are not able to ignore its global structure entirely .",
    "for example , unless we desire chiral fields charged under the adjoint of the gauge group , the fundamental group of @xmath11 must be finite ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; also , the local patch should be completed in such a way that no additional , unwanted charged matter arises .",
    "whether or not these non - compact , local @xmath0 constructions can be compactified is a very difficult mathematical question that may not find an answer for a long time - manifold with a conical singularity .",
    "but there are strong reasons to suspect they are not at all uncommon : because m - theory on a @xmath10-fibred @xmath0-manifold is dual to the heterotic string on a @xmath156-fibred calabi - yau three - fold , for example , the wide variety of heterotic constructions suggests that conical singularities in @xmath0-manifolds are not uncommon in moduli space ( see e.g. @xcite ) . ] . in principle , compactification should break the seemingly continuous range of possible values for the deformation moduli into a discrete landscape ; how large that landscape is , and whether or not it admits models consistent with experiment are of course very important questions that we are not able to answer yet today .    but one of the assets of our approach is the ability to describe a great deal of low - energy phenomenology before these mathematical challenges are overcome  that is , without full knowledge of the planck - scale physics and global topology .",
    "it is important then to ask under what conditions this separation of the problem is self - consistent",
    ". this should be the case if all the singularities giving rise to matter at low - energy are separated by distances much smaller than the size of @xmath11 .",
    "such a hierarchy of scales could be natural for example in the context of a warped compactification geometry .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the idea of unfolding geometrically engineered grand unified models as described in @xcite is also possible in m - theory .",
    "this suggests that if we continued our discussion to more unified initial geometries , we would also find the three families of the standard model unfolding naturally out of the an initial @xmath157 resolution .",
    "this could possibly provide a compelling explanation for the origin of three families in the standard model .",
    "furthermore , because the unfolded local geometry can in principle be completely specified , this approach is a modest step toward concrete phenomenological analyses of at least one class of models in m - theory .",
    "the author appreciates many helpful discussions with and suggestions from herman verlinde , sergei gukov , gordon kane , edward witten , paul langacker , bobby acharya , per berglund , liantao wang , dmitry malyshev , matthew buican , piyush kumar , and konstantin bobkov ."

    "<S> by reinterpreting the familiar tools and ideas of m - theory model building , we show how a @xmath0-manifold locally engineered to give rise to massless matter representations of an @xmath1 grand unified model can be smoothly unfolded into a @xmath0-manifold giving rise to @xmath2 gauge theory with the corresponding matter representations . </S>",
    "<S> these ideas could lead to new insights in string phenomenology because much of the arbitrariness of m - theory model building can be removed by supposing , for example , that the singularities giving rise to standard model particles could arise from unfolding a more singular , grand unified geometry . </S>"
