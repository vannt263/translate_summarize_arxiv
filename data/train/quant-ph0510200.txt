    "in quantum computation and quantum information theory @xcite and many of the related fields the well known bell basis finds numerous applications .",
    "this basis consists of four ortho - normal maximally entangled states of two qubits , denoted by :    @xmath0    the analogs of these states have been defined for @xmath1 dimensional systems , or qudits in the following form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an orthonormal basis for the space of one qudit .",
    "the states ( [ gbell1 ] ) are maximally entangled and are mutually orthogonal .",
    "these states have found applications in almost every generalization of quantum algorithms and protocols and investigations of entanglement in higher dimensional systems @xcite . + the present paper poses a simple question .",
    "+ can we construct a basis for the space of two qudits which has the following properties : + 1- it is an orthogonal basis , + 2- all the states have the same value of entanglement , and + 3- by varying a set of parameters , the basis while retaining the above two properties , continuously changes from a product basis to a maximally entangled basis ?",
    "+ we call such a basis an equi - entangled orthogonal basis or an interpolating basis",
    ". this question has a simple and well - known answer for qubits , namely @xmath5 this basis continuously connects a product basis ( for @xmath6 ) to a maximally entangled basis ( for @xmath7 ) .",
    "+ we should stress that it is quite trivial to construct one single state which interpolates between a product state and a maximally entangled state .",
    "what we want is an orthonormal basis which connects a product basis to a maximally entangled basis .",
    "moreover we require that all along the way each of the basis states has the same value of entanglement .",
    "+ to our knowledge such a construction has not been generalized to higher dimensions and it is our aim in this paper to obtain such an interpolating basis in higher dimensions .",
    "this construction turns out to be quite non - trivial , since it requires the solution of simultaneous non - linear equations the number of which increase with dimension . + before proceeding we would like to point out some probable applications of these kinds of states .",
    "+ in an interesting recent development it has been shown that optimal bell tests do not require maximally entangled states .",
    "in fact as stated in @xcite , it has often been assumed that generalized bell states of the form ( [ gbell1 ] ) represent the most nonlocal quantum states while in @xcite , it is shown that optimal states for tests of non - locality are not maximally entangled except in the case of qubits indicating that the role of dimension is more subtle than previously supposed . therefore having a set of mutually orthogonal states ,",
    "all with the same value of entanglement , may facilitate the search for optimal states that test non - locality in arbitrary dimensions . in effect",
    "having such an equi - entangled basis generalizes the concept of bell state measurement so that the measurement projects the measured states into mutually orthogonal states with a prescribed and tunable value of entanglement .",
    "+ there is an important question in quantum information theory : is the classical capacity of quantum channels still additive if we allow encoding of input data into entangled states ?",
    "although there are clues that in channels without memory @xcite ( where there is no correlation between two consecutive uses of the channel ) , entanglement does not enhance the capacity , for channels with memory there are clues that this is not the case @xcite . depending on the value of correlations and the type of channel , one may want to encode the data ( the alphabet or the strings ) into mutually orthogonal and hence distinguishable quantum states with a prescribed and not necessarily maximal value of entanglement .",
    "the analysis of such a channel will then be made much easier if all the states have the same value of entanglement .",
    "in other words such states make it possible to have mixed states of arbitrary entanglement by taking @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an equi - entangled orthonormal basis .",
    "+ other areas in which such states may find applications are quantum cryptography , quantum dense coding and quantum teleportation @xcite . in all these areas bell states and bell state measurements play an essential role and all of them have been generalized to arbitrary dimensions . a generalized bell state measurement in which the degree of entanglement of the output states can be tuned to any arbitrary value ,",
    "may someday find applications in these areas .",
    "+ presumably these are not the only applications that one may envisage for these kinds of states .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ general ] we present the general construction of these states in arbitrary dimensions and obtain the system of quadratic equations which should be solved explicitly in order to find the concrete form of the states . in sections",
    "[ three ] and [ four ] we present explicit solutions of the equations in three and four dimensions . finally in section",
    "[ higher ] we obtain the general solution of the quadratic system of equations in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "here we present a method for construction of equi - entangled bases . consider the single state @xmath10 and the unitary shift operator @xmath11 for @xmath12 , define @xmath13 states of the form    @xmath14    all these states have the same value of entanglement as the state @xmath15 , since all of them are obtained from @xmath15 by bi - local unitary operators .",
    "the value of entanglement is obtained by using von neumann entropy @xmath16    note that we have taken the logarithms in base @xmath17 so that a maximally entangled state has a value of entanglement equal to unity in all dimensions . + we now demand that they be ortho - normal .",
    "this leads to the following set of equations :    @xmath18    this is a set of @xmath17 quadratic equations for the complex coefficients @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of this set of equations gives the final form of the state @xmath20 and hence all the state vectors of the basis .",
    "+ a natural question arises as to whether this is the only possible construction for obtaining such bases .",
    "we have tired many other constructions and have found that the ansatz presented in this section gives the most elegant or even inevitable solution .",
    "in fact the most general way of constructing @xmath13 equi - entangled states from @xmath20 is to define the states as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are a set of @xmath24 unitary operators .",
    "however orthogonality puts a stringent requirement on these operators in the form @xmath25 one can simplify the situation by taking @xmath26 and @xmath27 , hence searching for two unitary operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the property that @xmath30 .",
    "calculations then show that the choice @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the shift operator defined above gives the most elegant solution . despite this",
    "we refrain to claim that our construction is a general one . + before proceeding to the general solution , for concreteness",
    ", we consider the cases of three and four dimensional spaces separately .",
    "if we assume that the basis vector @xmath20 is real , all the other vectors will be real and we can construct a basis for a real vector space . in this",
    "case equations ( [ ortho ] ) reduce to the following two equations @xmath33 parameterizing the variables in the first equation by polar coordinates    @xmath34    and inserting these into the second equation we obtain a relation between the parameters , namely @xmath35 taking this relation into account we find the final form of the coefficients :    @xmath36    thus we find a single parameter family of interpolating basis . for @xmath37 , we find @xmath38 and hence the basis becomes disentangled . using equation ( [ ent ] ) we can calculate the entanglement . it is plotted in figure ( [ e3a ] ) as a function of @xmath39 .    ) as a function of @xmath39 ( in degree)( ) .",

    "the entanglement is dimensionless.,width=453,height=302 ]    the maximum entanglement is approximately equal to @xmath40 .",
    "this shows that in a real three dimensional space , we can not interpolate to a maximally entangled basis at least by the construction presented in this paper",
    ". however an interpolating basis exists in a complex three dimensional space as we show in the next subsection .",
    "+      again in this case equations ( [ ortho ] ) reduce to two equations @xmath41    a solution for this set of equations leads to the following state @xmath20 @xmath42 the reader can read the coefficients from the above state and can check that equations ( [ 100 ] ) are satisfied . for convenience",
    "we list here the nine states of the basis , with @xmath43 , they read @xmath44    the reader can easily check that this basis is orthogonal . moreover",
    "this basis interpolates between a product basis for @xmath45 and a maximally entangled basis for @xmath46 .",
    "the entanglement of this basis is plotted as a function of @xmath39 in figure ( [ e3a ] ) .",
    "in four dimensions we can find an interpolating basis for real vector spaces . in this case equations ( [ ortho ] ) reduce to the following three equations : @xmath47 a solution ( not the only solution ) of these equations is provided by @xmath48 leading to the state @xmath20 ,    @xmath49    the basis thus constructed is a separable state for @xmath50 and a maximally entangled for @xmath51 .",

    "let    @xmath54    the corresponding basis interpolates between a separable basis ( for @xmath6 ) where @xmath55 to a maximally entangled basis ( for @xmath56 ) , where @xmath57 a simple calculation shows that the entanglement of this basis is equal to @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "figure ( [ e4a ] ) shows the value of entanglement as a function of the parameter @xmath52 .",
    "it is seen that for a rather broad range of the parameter , the state is nearly maximally entangled .    until now we have restricted ourselves to low - dimensional spaces . in the next section we provide a general solution of @xmath17 dimensional spaces .",

    "we expand the vector @xmath64 in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath32 .",
    "the matrix @xmath32 having the property @xmath66 , has the following spectrum @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 inserting the expansion of the vector @xmath64 in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath32 as    @xmath70    into ( [ orthomatrix ] ) , we find a system of linear equations for the absolute square of the coefficients @xmath71 , given by    @xmath72    the unique solution of this last equation is given by @xmath73 or @xmath74 where @xmath75 are @xmath17 free parameters . of these",
    ", one parameter can be absorbed into the total phase of state and we remain with @xmath76 continuous parameters . inserting these values in the expansion of @xmath64,we",
    "find the final form of the desired coefficients , @xmath77 thus we have found a @xmath76 parameter family of @xmath13 orthonormal states all of which have the same value of entanglement .",
    "when all the parameters @xmath78 , we find from ( [ afinals ] ) that @xmath79 and hence @xmath15 and all the other states become separable . by varying the parameters @xmath75 , we can continuously change the entanglement of the basis .",
    "the question of wether one can actually reach maximally entangled states in this family amounts to finding solutions for @xmath75 in the system of equations ( [ afinals ] ) such that the left hand sides are all @xmath80pure phases .",
    "this question is difficult to answer in its generality .",
    "we have tried to find solutions in low dimensional spaces , although we would like to stress that the very existence of such solutions in arbitrary dimensions is not certain to us .",
    "we present some of the solutions below in table ( [ table1 ] ) .",
    "having such solutions which we denote by @xmath61 one can easily define an interpolating basis by writing @xmath81 , where @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "we have posed a question on the existence of a basis for a tensor product of two @xmath17 dimensional spaces ( qudits ) so that by changing some parameters , this basis while being orthonormal , changes continuously from a product basis into a maximally entangled basis .",
    "we have also required that all the states of such a basis have the same value of entanglement during the interpolation .",
    "we call such a basis an equi - etangled orthonormal basis",
    ". we have found such bases explicitly in three and four and five dimensional spaces and have given a general solution for spaces of arbitrary dimensions .",
    "such bases are of theoretical and possibly experimental interest for several reasons .",
    "first they provide us with a generalized bell state measurement in which the output states are not necessarily maximally entangled but states with a prescribed value of entanglement",
    ". this application may be interesting in view of the recent results that in dimensions higher than two , maximally entangled states are not necessarily the states which have maximal non - locality .",
    "second they provide us with a tool for analyzing the effect of entanglement in the capacity of quantum channels , since we can encode the input alphabet into mutually distinguishable entangled codewords .",
