    "the synthesis of herbertsmithite and similar frustrated antiferromagnets with a spin-1/2 kagome lattice has generated in the past intense research efforts because these materials possibly realize a quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) phase  @xcite .",
    "however , a problem in herbertsmithite and related materials is the intrinsic disorder  @xcite , which makes the interpretation of experimental data more difficult and might even prevent the formation of a qsl .",
    "therefore , chemical alternatives to herbertsmithite with slightly different bonding environment are intensively sought for  @xcite .",
    "recently , the geometrically perfect spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet barlowite [ cu@xmath0(oh)@xmath1fbr ] was discovered  @xcite .",
    "it is closely related to herbertsmithite , but shows a different stacking pattern of the kagome layers and features magnetic ions on interplane sites , which couple the kagome planes magnetically and lead to magnetic ordering at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "selective doping of non - magnetic ions into those interplane sites could be a way to remove these interlayer couplings and realize a quantum spin liquid .",
    "previous calculations showed that substitution with several divalent cations should be possible  @xcite .",
    "these authors predicted that magnesium and zinc can selectively substitute the interlayer copper atoms , but did not make a statement about the resulting structure of the magnetic exchange paths .",
    "as the interlayer distance in barlowite is relatively small , a finite interlayer exchange can however be expected , even when the magnetic ions between the kagome layers are removed .    using _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations we investigate the energetics of selectively substituting the copper ions between kagome layers in the barlowite system .",
    "in contrast to previous speculations  @xcite and in agreement with recent calculations  @xcite we find that isoelectronic doping at interlayer position becomes energetically less favorable with increasing ionic radius of the substituent .",
    "hence , we identify ions with radius similar to cu@xmath2 as the most promising candidates for substitution , such as magnesium or zinc . in this respect",
    "we agree with the calculations by liu _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we however find that most other ions lead to monoclinically distorted crystal structures with no perfect kagome arrangement of copper ions .    based on the crystal structures predicted for those substitutions with perfect kagome lattice we estimate the magnetic exchange couplings in the substituted barlowite system .",
    "we find that the corresponding heisenberg hamiltonian takes a very simple form with a parameter @xmath3 describing the nearest - neighbor kagome coupling and a parameter @xmath4 describing the inter - layer exchange energy .",
    "we compare our findings to recent model calculations , which suggested a qsl for certain ratios of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "experimental and hypothetical crystal structures were fully relaxed using the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite implemented in gpaw  @xcite with a plane - wave cutoff of @xmath6 and the gga exchange - correlation functional  @xcite .",
    "we optimized all crystal structures using @xmath7 @xmath8-points until forces were below @xmath9 .",
    "we started from the experimental crystal structure of barlowite  @xcite and substituted the interlayer copper site ( cu@xmath2 ) by @xmath10=mg@xmath2 ,  ca@xmath2 ,  sr@xmath2 ,  zn@xmath2 ,  cd@xmath2 ,  hg@xmath2 ,  sn@xmath2 ,  pb@xmath2 , forming @xmath10-substituted barlowite , @xmath10cu@xmath11(oh)@xmath1fbr . from this relaxation",
    "we obtained the desirable crystal structure with perfect kagome lattice of substituted barlowite in space group @xmath12 , containing two formula units . while most of the cations considered here are almost certainly divalent , tin and lead are more flexible with respect to their oxidation state",
    "therefore , it has to be verified that these cations indeed assume a divalent state when substituted into barlowite .    .calculated isoelectronic doping energies for barlowite .",
    "positive values of the doping energy @xmath13 indicate that the kagome lattice will be distorted upon doping . on the interlayer site",
    ", barlowite prefers to incorporate ions with smaller radius than cu@xmath2 ( 72  pm ) .",
    "ionic radii in coordination number 6 are taken from refs .  .",

    "the top panel of each subplot shows the dos of the minority spin channel , while the bottom panel shows the dos of the majority spin channel . ]    the calculated gga density of states for mg - barlowite and sn - barlowite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dossn ] .",
    "the most prominent difference between the two materials is the distribution of the bromine and fluorine states , which are shifted to much lower energies in sn - barlowite .",
    "especially the hybridization between bromine and copper is very much reduced .",
    "furthermore , integration of the copper density of states reveals that the occupation is one electron higher than in mg - barlowite , while tin is in a trivalent state .",
    "we conclude that tin donates an additional electron into the copper kagome layer .",
    "this behavior can be rationalized based on the observation that doping onto the interlayer site becomes more stable with smaller ionic radius ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dopingenergy ] ) .",
    "while sn@xmath2 has an ionic radius of 93  pm  @xcite , sn@xmath15 has an ionic radius of 81  pm . as a consequence sn - barlowite can gain energy by reducing the ionic radius as tin becomes trivalent .",
    "the strong expansion of the @xmath16-axis can be explained by an elongation of the cu - o bonds due to the additional charge on the copper atoms donated from tin .",
    "this reduction of cu - o hybridization is directly visible in the density of states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dossn ] ) .",
    "this in turn might explain the large shift in bromine and fluorine energy levels compared to mg - barlowite .",
    "elongation of cu - o bonds induces a shrinking of the f - h bonds , which leads to a strong lowering of the fluorine energy levels .",
    "bromine on the other hand almost exclusively hybridizes with copper , and these cu - br bonds are significantly elongated in sn - barlowite , probably again due to the additional charge available on the copper atoms .",
    "therefore , the hybridization between bromine and copper is reduced and bromine states are less relevant in the vicinity of the fermi level .     ion positions for a @xmath17 supercell of zn - barlowite are shown .",
    "the numbers on the twelve inequivalent cu@xmath2 ions allow encoding of the spin configuration indicated with arrows as the string `` dddduudduuuu '' where d@xmath18 and u@xmath19 . ]    additionally , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : dossnggau ] the spin - resolved gga+u density of states for ferromagnetic arrangement of copper moments . in our calculations",
    ", mg - barlowite clearly becomes insulating once magnetism and interactions are considered , while sn - barlowite stays metallic due to to the additional electron in the copper kagome layer , leading to @xmath20 filling  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : magneticconf ] and [ fig : magneticenergiesfit ] illustrate the energy mapping method used to extract heisenberg hamiltonian parameters from dft total energies .",
    "energy mapping is a widely used standard method in the context of spin systems  @xcite .",
    "all 4096 spin configurations for the twelve inquivalent cu spins of a @xmath17 supercell of doped barlowite with @xmath21 symmetry are classified with respect to their classical exchange energy .",
    "representatives for the 25 distinct energy values are chosen ( one example is shown in figure  [ fig : magneticconf ] ) , and total dft energies are calculated ( filled circles in figure  [ fig : magneticenergiesfit ] ) . fitting these energies to classical exchange energies yields the seven exchange couplings shown in the third line of table  [ tab : couplings ] , with small statistical errors .",
