    "@xmath14    in the present paper we make use of the real functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 that we introduced in ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) of @xcite . @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the subsection below , we will derive essential properties of local extrema of @xmath1 under the assumption that the riemann hypothesis is true .",

    "we label these countably infinite zeros so that @xmath22 , with @xmath23",
    ". then , the product form ( [ product - form ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath24 where we define @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , as defined in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "we term @xmath25 the `` @xmath29th factor '' of the product - form expression for @xmath4 .",
    "let us bring the @xmath30-th factor out of the product - form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 it is shown in appendix a that @xmath33 can be approximated by the following expression for @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants .",
    "then , the real part of @xmath4 is found to be @xmath38 where the approximation was obtained by noting that @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "thus , it is a parabola of @xmath41 and touches the horizontal axis at its extremum point @xmath42 ( see e.g. , figure [ fig - cross](a ) ) .",

    "a local extremum of @xmath1 occurs at @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",
    "then , from ( [ diffs - of - txi ] ) we find that the following relation holds at all extremum points @xmath52 : @xmath53 which implies that if @xmath54 is a local maximum ( i.e. , if @xmath55 ) , then @xmath56 . likewise , if @xmath54 is a local minimum ( i.e. , if @xmath57 ) , then @xmath58 .",

    "in this section we shall investigate the inverse of theorem [ theorem - necessity - rh ] .",
    "let us start with the following lemma :    [ lemma - saddle - point](local extrema of @xmath1 and saddle points )    any extremum point of @xmath1 is a saddle point of the function @xmath2 .    since @xmath4 is a holomorphic function",
    ", @xmath2 is a harmonic function .",
    "it is known that every critical point of a harmonic function is a saddle point . to verify this",
    ", we apply the so - called discriminant function test ( or the second partial derivative test ) , which is well known in multivariate calculus , that is , to examine whether the determinant of the hessian matrix of @xmath2 evaluated at @xmath89 is negative or not instead of @xmath10 for notational convenience . ] : @xmath90 the first term of the last expression was obtained by applying laplace s equation to the function @xmath91 , and the second term was obtained by using the cauchy - riemann equation , and this last term is zero because of ( 8) in @xcite .",
    "hence , we find @xmath92    if @xmath93 crosses zero upward at @xmath50 , then @xmath57 , and @xmath2 is a convex function of @xmath13 and a concave function of @xmath94 at the point @xmath95 .",
    "thus , this point is a saddle point of the function @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath93 crosses zero downward at @xmath50 , then @xmath55 , and @xmath2 is a concave function of @xmath13 and a convex function of @xmath94 at @xmath95 , which is again a saddle point of @xmath4 .    if @xmath96 , the point @xmath97 is an inflection point in both @xmath13 and @xmath94 directions .",
    "but since @xmath2 is symmetric around @xmath66 , we find that @xmath98 , which implies @xmath99 for all @xmath94 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath96 , if and only if @xmath100 for all @xmath94 , which is impossible .",
    "thus , we have shown that all local extremum points of @xmath1 are saddle points of @xmath101 .",
    "now let us suppose that the riemann hypothesis is false , i.e. , there should exist a pair of zeros @xmath102 and @xmath103 of the form @xmath104 and their complex conjugates @xmath105 must be also zeros .",
    "we assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath106 and @xmath107 . then the product - form expression for the hypothetical @xmath108-function , denoted @xmath109 ,",
    "can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is also a hypothetical function , representing the product of the four multiplicative factors in the product - form ( [ product - form ] ) ) , we used the approximation @xmath112 which should not affect the validity of the rest of this paper .",

    "but such consideration should not affect the essence of our conclusion of this section , other than @xmath117 would change its polarity , and its magnitude by a factor of approximately @xmath118 . ]",
    "@xmath119    as is derived in appendix a , @xmath120 can be be given by the following estimate in the vicinity of @xmath121 : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are real constants .",
    "this approximation formula could be improved by including higher order terms @xmath125 ( in the imaginary part ) and or @xmath126 terms ( in the real part ) .",
    "thus , ( [ xi_h ] ) can be estimated for @xmath121 by @xmath127 from which we see that the real part is an even function of @xmath41 and is zero exactly at @xmath128 , and the imaginary part is an odd function of @xmath41 and is zero at @xmath128 and @xmath42 ( see appendix b ) .    by setting @xmath42 in ( [ xi_h ] ) , we find @xmath129 which can be approximated in the vicinity of @xmath130 by @xmath131[(t+t_k)^2+\\lambda_k^2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and its value at @xmath130 : @xmath132    by taking the absolute value of both sides in ( [ xi - product - form ] ) , taking their logarithms and differentiating them w.r.t . to @xmath13 , we find @xmath133 note that @xmath134 for any real function @xmath135 at @xmath136 .",
    "thus , the evaluation of the above at @xmath130 yields @xmath137 which , together with ( [ xi - t_k ] ) , gives @xmath138 which should be equal to @xmath139 .",
    "since the above is not exactly zero , the point @xmath130 is not a local extremum point of @xmath117 .    by differentiating ( [ log - dif - absxi ] )",
    "once more , we find @xmath140 which leads to @xmath141    based on what we have found up to this point , we make the following proposition :    ( a necessary condition for the riemann hypothesis to be false)[lemma - conjecture ]    suppose that we conjecture that a pair of zeros possibly exist on the line @xmath130 , together with their complex conjugates on the line @xmath142 . a necessary condition for this conjecture to be true ( i.e. , for the riemann hypothesis to fail ) is to show that the value of @xmath143 is strictly positive .",
    "suppose @xmath144 .",
    "then , the function @xmath1 is a convex function of @xmath13 in the vicinity of @xmath130 . from laplace",
    "s equation @xmath145 , thus the cross - section of @xmath146 along @xmath130 is a concave function of @xmath41 , and is a parabola in the range @xmath147 , with its maximum occurring at @xmath42 .",
    "then , a necessary and sufficient condition for this function to become zero at @xmath128 , is that the cross - section at @xmath42 , which is @xmath148 , is strictly positive . if @xmath149 , then it implies @xmath150 , the degenerated case where the two zeros @xmath151 reduce to one on the critical line .",
    "if @xmath152 , the above argument should be modified by replacing `` convex '' to `` convex , ''  maximum  to `` minimum , '' and `` positive '' to `` negative . '' in either case , the ratio @xmath153 must be strictly positive for the riemann hypothesis to be rejected .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath148 is neither a local maximum , nor a local minimum , because @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the above lemma can not be directly applicable to solving the riemann hypothesis , since we have no way of knowing a possible value of @xmath155 , even if such @xmath155 should exist . as we show in appendix b , however , there should always exist a local extremum point @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is strictly positive , as given by ( [ delta - in - theorem ] ) below .",
    "thus , we can make the following assertion :    ( a sufficient condition for the riemann hypothesis to hold asymptotically)[theorem - sufficient ]    if local maxima of @xmath1 are all nonnegative and its local minima are are all non - positive , then the riemann hypothesis is asymptotically true , i.e. , at @xmath3 .",
    "as is derived in appendix b , for any @xmath155 where nontrivial zeros off the critical line might exist , there is a point @xmath158 , which is a local extremum of the real function @xmath1 , where @xmath159 thus , it is clear that @xmath160 .",
    "let us continue the example of the preceding section .",
    "for the sake of a hypothetical example , let us consider the case @xmath161 ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) , and @xmath162 , i.e. , we have @xmath163 and their complex conjugates as zeros of @xmath4 .    figures [ fig - hypothetical ] ( a ) and ( b ) are the real and imaginary parts of the factor function @xmath81 ( [ f_k(s ) ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath164 and @xmath165 that approximate @xmath166 plotted earlier in figure [ fig - cross ] ( b ) are estimated to be @xmath167 figure [ fig - hypothetical ] ( c ) is a plot of the function ( [ xi - k - approx ] ) at @xmath130 , which is hardly distinguishable from the curves of figure [ fig - cross ] ( b ) .",

    ". consequently , the functional form of @xmath233 of ( [ xi_j - product ] ) is dictated by a finite number of terms whose @xmath20 values are not far from @xmath13 ( i.e. , case 2 ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see that a holomorphic function whose cross section along @xmath234 has a quadratic function in its real part and a straight line in its imaginary part that cuts through zero is limited to the following function @xmath235 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are real constants .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this function satisfies the cauchy - riemann equations , and laplace s equation .",
    "furthermore , the function is reflective , just like @xmath4 and @xmath236 .",
    "if we should include @xmath126 and higher - order terms in the real part , and @xmath125 and nigher order terms in the imaginary part , we could certainly improve the approximation , but for the purpose of our analysis , such generalization would merely complicate the analysis and would not contribute to any additional insight into the heart of the problem we are interested in .    on the critical line @xmath42 , each term in the product representation ( [ xi - minus - j ] )",
    "is given by @xmath237 hence , the function @xmath33 is real on the critical line , and we denote it by @xmath238 : @xmath239 where @xmath1 is defined by ( [ def - xi ] ) , which can be written because of the product form ( [ product - form ] ) as @xmath240    the slope of the imaginary part of @xmath44 crosses the critical line @xmath42 is given by @xmath241 as given in ( [ def - b - t ] ) . from ( [ def - b - t ] ) , we have @xmath242 if we set @xmath234 all terms in the summation vanish except for the term @xmath243 , thus obtaining @xmath244 which can be alternatively derived by differentiating ( [ im - xi ] ) w.r.t . @xmath41 and setting @xmath42 .",
    "when the imaginary part of the cross section @xmath245 crosses zero at @xmath246 and @xmath247 for some @xmath247 such that @xmath107 , which is a necessary condition to disprove the riemann hypothesis , the slope @xmath16 at @xmath130 is not zero .",
