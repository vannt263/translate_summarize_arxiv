    "<S> the protected surface states of tcis with space - time inversion symmetry are characterized by a quantized @xmath0 berry phase , for any loop enclosing all dirac points thereof . as stated above </S>",

    "<S> here we provide a general proof for both cases . </S>",
    "<S> first we show that the berry s phase is independent of the geometry ( such as size or shape ) of the loop . </S>",
    "<S> according to stokes theorem , the difference between berry phases associated with two loops mod @xmath7 is given by the integral of berry curvature over the region bounded by them . </S>",
    "<S> for systems with glide plane symmetry , the berry s curvature for the surface states satisfies @xmath65 , due to the oddness of @xmath66 under reflection @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> so for any loop symmetric about a mirror invariant line , the berry s curvature integral inside the loop subtract the singular band crossing point vanishes . for systems with space - time inversion symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> berry s curvature satisfies @xmath68 due to the oddness of @xmath66 under time - reversal symmetry , and hence vanishes everywhere in @xmath31 space . </S>",

    "<S> now let us add perturbations that break trs but preserve the glide plane or @xmath45 ; we immediately obtain the @xmath1 tci phases found in this work </S>",
    "<S> . this observation makes it very simple to find these new tcis in spinful systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the newly discovered topological kondo insulator smb@xmath69@xcite has @xmath70-symmetry on the @xmath71-surface . adding any magnetic field parallel to the surface preserves @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> hence smb@xmath69 with an in - plane field can be considered as a @xmath1 tci protected by @xmath45 , having an odd number of dirac cones located away from any trim .    </S>",
    "<S> to realize the new tci phases in systems without spin - orbit coupling ( or equivalently , spinless systems ) requires breaking trs . </S>",
    "<S> this can be shown by proving that a single dirac cone characteristic of these tcis can not appear on the surface of a time - reversal - invariant spinless insulator . to see this </S>",
    "<S> , first note that dirac cones at non - trim must appear in pairs with opposite momenta . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves the possibility of having a single dirac cone at one trim . </S>",
    "<S> however , given that time - reversal symmetry is represented by @xmath72 ( up to a gauge ) for spinless fermions and it reverses @xmath31 measured from the trim , a 2d dirac hamiltonian is simply not allowed by @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because only one of the three pauli matrices , namely , @xmath59 , is reversed under @xmath55 , while a 2d dirac hamiltonian such as @xmath74 or any other form must involve two pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this concludes that a single dirac cone can not exist on the surface of a spinless system with time - reversal symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the key requirement for spinless tcis is to break trs while preserving the relevant crystal symmetry of either glide mirror or space - time inversion . </S>",
    "<S> one may search in magnetic insulators with negligible soc , since many types of magnetic order have at least one of the two symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we note that photonic crystals may be a very promising platform for finding these tci phases , because their structures and crystal symmetries can be easily manipulated@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ stability against disorder and quantum hall criticality _ we now show that topological surface states of tcis with either glide mirror or @xmath45 symmetry are fully robust against any type of disorder ( magnetic or nonmagnetic ) and can not be exponentially localized even under strong disorder on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of a disordered ti surface with random magnetic impurities@xcite , the delocalization of tci surface states here is protected by the average symmetry@xcite  by definition the ensemble of tcis with all disorder realizations must preserve the relevant symmetry . consider a finite area on the surface where surface states are gapped by disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the mass @xmath75 acquired by the dirac cone can either be positive or negative , corresponding to two types of domains . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry ( glide mirror or @xmath45 ) maps a @xmath76 domain to a @xmath77 domain and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the two domains have quantized half - integer hall conductivity @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively ; between the two domains of opposite signs there exists a chiral edge mode . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the presence of random disorder , these chiral modes percolate through the surface and the surface states remain delocalized . </S>",
    "<S> this argument also shows that the disordered tci surface is symmetry - enforced to be in a critical phase ( rather than fine - tuned to a critical point ) in the same universality class as the quantum hall plateau transition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the surface exhibits a universal longitudinal conductivity on the order of @xmath80 , and a nontrivial scaling of longitudinal and hall conductivity as a function of an applied out - of - plane magnetic field @xmath81 , which gaps the dirac point and drives each surface into a quantum hall state with a hall conductance @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the space - time inversion symmetry protects the gapless surface dirac point by forbidding this out - of - plane magnetic field , thereby defining a tci phase . </S>",
    "<S> other symmetries such as reflection or any _ improper _ rotation can also forbid the perpendicular field , and therefore guarantees at least a @xmath1 classification of tcis@xcite , as in the two classes studied here .    to conclude , we have theoretically predicted two new classes of 3d @xmath1 tci that have unpinned surface dirac cones , which are protected by a glide plane and @xmath45 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 nature distinguishes the new tci from the @xmath83 tci protected by mirror symmetry such as snte . because of the ` unpinned ' nature of the surface dirac cone , the tci phases studied in this work lie beyond the previous classification of tcis with nonsymmorphic space groups based solely on considerations of 2d irreducible representations of the wallpaper groups@xcite . besides looking at the surface states </S>",
    "<S> , we also mathematically prove the @xmath1 classification which directly reveals the bulk band topology . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the new tci phases can be realized in both spinful and in spinless systems . in spinful systems </S>",
    "<S> , these tcis can be realized by applying perturbations that break trs yet preserving glide plane or @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the realization of tcis in spinless systems is an interesting subject that we leave to future work .    </S>",
