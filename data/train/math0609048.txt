    "when coloring a graph properly , so that the endpoints of each edge have different colors , it makes no difference what the colors are ; all that matters is the number of colors in the color set . when coloring a gain graph , where the edges are labelled by elements of a group , that is no longer true .",
    "the group must have a permutation action on the set of colors if the concept of a proper coloration is to mean anything , and the exact way the group acts matters very much .",
    "one of the major properties of graph coloring , that the number of proper colorations in @xmath0 colors is a polynomial function of @xmath0 that depends mainly on the graphic matroid , holds for gain graphs only when the group action on the color set is trivial , or regular , or nearly regular ; this constrains @xmath0 to take on only a fraction of all positive integer values . despite this , an even more basic coloring property , the law of deletion and contraction , holds good for every color set with any group action , and there is a generalized , though non - matroidal , chromatic polynomial .",

    "what has been studied heretofore in connection with states has been principally the question of whether a state is satisfied ( i.e. , has no frustrated edges ) and , if not , just how frustrated it is .",
    "however , if we turn to states in which _ no _ edge is satisfied , we discover a generalization of a classic problem of graph theory , the problem of proper coloring . our objective is to examine coloring of gain graphs from the point of view of these _ totally frustrated states_.      what is new is that the set of spins is arbitrary . in the standard theory of gain - graph coloring , from (",

    "the difference between a state , with an arbitrary spin set , and a coloration , whose spin set ( or ` color set ' ) is @xmath65 or @xmath17 , is that in a coloration the spin set yields properties very similar to those of ordinary graph coloring .",
    "for instance , the set of frustrated edges in a coloration is closed in the frame matroid @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "one could say that the crux of the difference is the behavior of loops  not surprisingly , because knowing which spins on its supporting vertex satisfy a loop with gain @xmath66 is the same as knowing the fixed points of @xmath66 acting on @xmath5 , and by theorems [ t : chromatic ] and [ t : nonmatroid ] , that is what decides whether or not @xmath67 does or does not equal the chromatic or zero - free chromatic polynomial of @xmath30 ( or the chromatic polynomial of the underlying graph ) .",
