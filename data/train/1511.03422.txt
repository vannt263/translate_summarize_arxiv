    "evidences accumulated in the past decade point to the phenomenon that feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) plays a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "outflows in agns connect the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) to their host galaxies , and regulate their co - evolution ( granato et al .",
    "2004 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ; also see antonuccio - delogu & silk 2010 for a recent review ) .",
    "observationally , the most direct and obvious performance of agn outflows is the high - speed blueshifted broad absorption lines ( bals ) . because of the high fraction in optically selected quasars ( 10%-20% ) , high - ionization bal ( hibal ) quasars",
    "are widely studied , with strong absorption troughs in high ionization ions such as , , , and , up to a velocity of @xmath11 ( e.g. , weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; trump et al . 2006 ; gibson et al .",
    "bals are also detected occasionally ( @xmath12 in bal quasars and @xmath13 in all quasars ) in low ionization species such as and , named as low - ionization bals ( lobals ) ( e.g. , weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; reichard et al . 2003 ; zhang et al .",
    "moreover , felobal quasars have been observed to exhibit the broad absorption troughs in and/or , which are rare and only found in only @xmath12 of lobal quasars ( hall et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "statistical studies are widely used to explain the bal phenomenon .",
    "bal quasars on average have red continua ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ; richards et al . 2003 ; zhang et al . 2010 , 2014 ) weak x - ray emission ( e.g. , green et al .",

    "; brandt et al . 2000 ; gallagher et al . 2002 , 2006 ; fan et al . 2009 ) , are more frequently detected in quasars with higher eddington ratio and higher luminosity ( ganguly et al .",
    "2007 ; zhang et al . 2010 , 2014 ) .",
    "furthermore , the outflow velocity and strength are tied to the properties of quasars . observed outflow velocities increase with the blueness of uv spectral slope , the enhancement of black hole accretion and the equivalent width of emission ( hamann 1998 ; laor & brandt 2002 ; gungly et al .",
    "2007 ; misawa et al . 2007 ; baskin et al . 2013 ; zhang et al . 2014 ) .",
    "in particular , the minimum velocity of absorption is even more strongly correlated with uv spectral slope than the maximum velocity ( zhang et al .",
    "these findings indicate the primary role of radiatively driven winds in the outflow phenomenon , and the importance of the spectral energy distribution shape ( sed ) in governing the dynamics of outflows .",
    "meanwhile , all outflow parameters dramatically and monotonically increase with hot dust emission .",
    "these correlations can be more naturally interpreted as the dusty outflow scenario rather than the dust - free outflow scenario , where the dust is intrinsic to the outflows or interaction with torus clouds ( wang et al .",
    "2013 ; zhang et al .",
    "2014 ) .    on the other hand , the study of variation of bal troughs and the associated rare absorption systems , i.e. , lobals , and unusual bals ( mostly felobals ) can provide a new and more effective perspective to understand the physical conditions , locations and origins of the absorbers , and constraint on the outflow mechanism , which gradually becomes a hot topic of the bal research ( e.g. , hall et al .",

    "several regions of the spectrum are absorbed and significantly below the nuclear continuum . except bals of and",

    "we further selected two quasars ( sdss j082806.18 + 063608.3 and sdss j125807.45 + 232921.6 ) using the pair - matching method ( zhang et al .",
    "2014 ; liu et al .",
    "2015 ) , which can match the continuum slop and emission multiplets of 1523  except for the absorbing troughs . compared with the spectra of the two quasars ( green and red curves ) , bal troughs of h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 are evident .",
    "we marked the potential bal absorption regions by gray dashed lines .    in order to exactly measure the absorption troughs of balmer lines",
    ", we simultaneously fit the continuum and emission lines in the h@xmath53 and h@xmath0 regions using the code of dong et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in brief , the optical continuum from 4000    to 7000    is approximated by a single power - law ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the value of the slope estimated from continuum windows is took as initial values of @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , we also try to use a broken power - law with a break wavelength of 5600  , i.e. , @xmath55 for the h@xmath53 region and @xmath56 for the h@xmath0 region .",
    "however , we get the almost same values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "that means a single power - law is enough to model the continuum .",
    "multiplets , both broad and narrow , are modeled using the template provided by vron - cetty et al .",
    "emission lines are modeled as multiple gaussians : two gaussians for broad balmer lines , one gaussian for [ ] .",
    "there are no significant narrow emission lines in the spectra of 1523 , thus we do not add gaussians for narrow emission lines .",
    "additionally , we assume that the [ ] @xmath594959,5007 doublets have the same redshift and profile and their flux ratio is fixed to theoretical value .",
    "we notice that the spectrum of sdss j125807.45 + 232921.6 can cover the blue wing ( @xmath60 km  s@xmath4 ) and red wing of broad h@xmath0 line in 1523 ( figure [ f2 ] , panel ( b ) ) , that means h@xmath0 emission is likely unaffected by the bal absorption .",
    "thus , we just mask the potential bal absorption regions ( gray dashed lines ) in the fitting .    in top panels of figure [ f3 ]",
    ", we show the rest - frame spectra of the sdss and triplespec in black curves and our best - fit models in red curves .",
    "a more accurate continuum around h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 , @xmath61 , is shown in pink dashed line .",
    "the blue solid lines show the broad and narrow components of optical emission and the green curves represent the three strong balmer lines . in panel",
    "( a ) , the strong narrow 37 multiplets are present in h@xmath53 bal trough .",
    "this implies that the outflow winds may only obscure the nuclear continuum and broad emission lines , but not the narrow emission lines .",
    "this speculation is consistent with our detailed calculation in  4.2 .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen from the normalized spectra of h@xmath0 , h@xmath53 and h@xmath1 ( figure [ f3 ] , panel ( c ) ) that the h@xmath0 trough is polluted by the sky lines .",
    "the latter is plotted as the grey line in panel ( b ) of figure [ f3 ] for comparison .",
    "that is more remarkable in the normalized spectrum of h@xmath0 in velocity space , the corresponding polluted velocity regions are marked by green lines ( panel ( c ) ) . the ` true ' normalized spectrum in these polluted regions is approximately given through interpolation of those in unpolluted regions .",
    "absorption parameters of balmer bal troughs are listed in table [ tab2 ] .",

    "furthermore , the ratio of multiplets with different excitation is very sensitive to the temperature and density of the gas .",
    "the balmer bal troughs are unfortunately falling into the regimes of multiplets .",
    "thus , we used a new template derived from the keck spectrum of iras 07598 + 650 ( vron - cetty et al . 2006 ) to investigate the impact of templates .",
    "we first decompose the continuum emission of iras 07598 + 650 from the keck spectrum trough a single power - law fitting based on the above - mentioned continuum windows in  2 .",
    "after subtracting the modeled continuum , the residual spectrum which includes broad and narrow and balmer emission lines is used as emission template . in panel",
    "( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ f3 ] , the cyan curves show the new best - fit model , which is the sum of power - law continuum ( pink ) and scaled emission template .",
    "it can be seen that the new unabsorbed model around h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 bal troughs is below the best - fitting template causeing weaker h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 absorption .",
    "conversely , it shows a stronger h@xmath1 bal than the previous measurement .    in order to further rule out the possibility that balmer bals are resulting from the artifacts of spectral fittings",

    "we used them to normalize the observed spectra of 1523 and calculated the absorption equivalent width of balmer bals .",

    "percentage absorption depths of the troughs ( table [ tab2 ] ) decrease as the upper term of the transition increases .",

    "there is a residual intensity of @xmath75 of the modelled flux at the velocity of the maximum absorption depth ( figure [ f3 ] , panel ( c ) ) , suggesting that the absorption materials only obscure @xmath76 of the total continuum region .",

    "transitions from this level will generate a series of absorption lines at @xmath593189 , 3889 , 10830  , which are detected in seven quasars , except for sdss j112611.63 + 425246.4 , sdss j125942.80 + 121312.6 and sdss j172341.10 + 555340.5 . another",
    "interesting fact is that seven out of ten balmer absorption agns show abundant absorption lines arising from the excited the co - occurrence may indicate that it is probable that these three absorption phenomena are closely related .",
    "combined diagnostics of them can determine the density and the ionization state of the absorption gas , and put constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of outflows .",
    "for example , the absorbers in sdss j112526.12 + 002901.3 are considered to have the parameters of @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the derived distance from the central engine is about @xmath111 pc , which is about 10 times the size of broad emission line region and similar to the radius of the inner edge of dusty torus ( shi et al .",
    ", in pre . ) .",
    "these estimations provide us some enlightenment about the physical properties of the absorbers in 1523 .",
    "1523 has the strongest balmer bal troughs discovered to date , and exhibits simultaneously the broad absorption lines of * @xmath610830 and both ground and excited state .",
    "however , these absorption lines have extremely broad velocity structures and heavily overlap each other , which can not be trivially separated .      since the absorption lines are blended , it is not trivial to obtain the geometry and physical conditions of outflow winds via the combination of the absorption line diagnostics .",
    "the large - scale synthesis code cloudy ( c10.00 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) is employed to evaluate the absorption lines of these atoms / ions in the extensive parameter space .",
    "the geometry is assumed as a slab - shaped absorbing medium exposed to the ionizing continuum from the central engine with uniform density , metallicity and abundance pattern .",
    "the full 371 levels fe@xmath107 model is used to reproduce the absorption , and solar elemental abundance is adopted and the gas is assumed free of dust .",
    "in addition , a typical agn multi - component continuum is setted as incident ionizing radiation , where the  big bump \" component peaks at @xmath112 1 ryd and is parameterized by t=@xmath113 k. the x - ray to uv ratio is @xmath114 , and the low - energy slope of the big bump continuum is @xmath115 which is measured in  3.1 .",
    "the slope of the x - ray component is setted to the default @xmath116 ( see details in hazy , a brief introduction to cloudy c10 ; http://www.nublado.org ) .",
    "we calculated a series of photoionization models with different ionization parameters , electron densities and hydrogen column densities .",
    "the ranges of parameters are @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 with a step of 0.5 dex .",
    "synthetic model spectra are constructed to compare the simulations with observation .",
    "the underlying assumption is that other absorptions such as @xmath120 and have the same profile as balmer lines , which means for any ion the fraction of column density at given radial velocity to the integrated ionic column density is the same , and the covering factor as function of radial velocity is the same .",
    "therefore in constructing the model spectra , for a given absorption line , the ionic column density predicted by cloudy on the lower level of the transition is distributed to different outflow velocities following the fractional column density distribution versus @xmath121 from balmer series , evaluating the optical depth @xmath122 as function of @xmath121 . and then considering the effect of partial covering as @xmath123 to get the model absorption profile , where @xmath124 is the template for unabsorbed background radiation field .",
    "when comparing the model spectrum ( @xmath125 ) with the observed one , the spectrum from 4000 to 7000    covering the three balmer bals are employed in the fitting process .",
    "@xmath124 is actually the unabsorbed intrinsic spectrum , for example , the red curves shown in top panels of figure [ f3 ] for balmer lines . for each set of parameters ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , we calculated all possible combinations of individual models , and selected the one with minimized @xmath100 which is plotted in panel ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ f5 ] ( green curves ) .",
    "we derived physical parameters @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath129 for balmer bals .",
    "the green curves represent the model profiles of h@xmath53 and h@xmath0 absorption which match well to the observed spectra .",
    "meanwhile , we also plotted the model absorption trough of @xmath130 in panel ( c ) of figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the model absorption trough of @xmath130 bal is consistent with observation .",
    "note that , @xmath124 in the @xmath13110830 region is the blue curve shown in panel ( a ) of figure [ f4 ] , and the modeled @xmath125 should be added with the black - body emission component ( orange dashed line in figure [ f4 ] ) in the comparison of the model spectrum with observation .",
    "we further explored the various absorption and doublets in the sdss spectrum . here",
    ", the comparison spectrum of sdss j082806.18 + 063608.3 was used to represent the unabsorbed intrinsic spectrum . the observed spectrum ( black curve ) , and modeled spectrum with absorption ( green curve ) for 1523  are plotted in panel ( a ) of figure [ f6 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the modeled spectrum with absorption is in good agreement with the observed one at the red wing of and the longer wavelengths .",
    "the normalized fluxes at wavelength longger than 2800    are around 1 .",
    "that means that the absorption multiplets of opt.6,7 and opt.8 observed in 1523 can be largely recovered using the above modeled absorption . however , the match of opt.6,7 and opt.8 between model and observation is still fluky .",
    "1523  is observed to decrease in flux on the timescale of 8.99 years from the fbqs to the sdss , but the absorption of opt.6,7 and opt.8 changes weakly , and the dramatic absorption variabilities are uv 1 , uv 62 and . a photoionization model with lower density ( @xmath132 ) and ionization parameter ( @xmath133 ) than the above can approximatively match the absorption variations ( see figure 2 of zhang et al .",
    "2015b ) .    for the sdss blue - side spectrum",
    ", there seems to be other absorption components for uv 1 , uv 62 and , corresponding to outflow materials with low density .",
    "indeed , the comparison of 1523 and the two templates in panel ( b ) of figure [ f2 ] suggests the existence of the other absorption components . opt.6,7 and opt.8 have similar absorption depth as the balmer absorption troughs , while the troughs of uv 1 are nearly twice as deep as opt.6,7 and opt.8 multiplets .",
    "moreover , the residual fluxes of uv 62 and bal troughs are even only one - third of opt.6,7 and opt.8 troughs .",
    "we broadened a low density model ( @xmath9 , @xmath134 and @xmath129 ) with a single gaussian profile and blueshifted it to approximatively model the residual component shown in panel ( b ) of figure [ f6 ] .",
    "the fwhm of gaussian profile is 3000 km  s@xmath4and the blueshifted velocity is 14,000 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "if we use a uniform covering factor for this component , @xmath135 is found to be @xmath136 .",
    "we also noticed that the residual absorption spectrum indicate stronger absorption of uv144 - 149 and uv158 - 164 multiplets ( around 2400  ) than the optical model ( panel ( b ) of figure [ f2 ] ) , which most likely suggests a higher density or some microturbulence in the outflow winds ( shi et al . in pre . ) .      from the spectral fittings in section 3.1 ,",

    "the black hole mass computing formula of mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) give the similar results , @xmath145 m@xmath141 and @xmath146 .",
    "1523 is a typical narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) with a low black hole mass but high accretion ratio .",
    "the radius of broad emission line regions ( belrs ) , @xmath147 , can be estimated using the formula based on the luminosity at 5100 , @xmath148 where the parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath53 are @xmath149 and @xmath150 given in greene & ho ( 2005 ) and @xmath151 and @xmath152 given in kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) respectively .",
    "thus , the luminosity yields @xmath153 pc .",
    "the radius of the dust torus , @xmath154 , can also be estimated based on the thermal equilibrium of the inner side of the torus as @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath157 is the temperature of inner side of the tours .",
    "then , we get @xmath158 pc .",

    "thus , the high density outflow gas of balmer bals locates at or outside of the belrs , and less than the distance of the dust torus .",

    "then , a question is naturally raised : why does this object present such unique absorption property ? in zhang et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we know that outflow velocity strongly or moderately depends on the eddington ratio , luminosity , uv and nir slopes ( also see hamann 1998 ; misawa et al .",
    "2007 ; ganguly et al .",
    "the first three items represent the ionization sed and the amount of the high - energy photons , and the last item is the possible contribution of the dust to the outflow acceleration .",
    "1523 is a high - luminous nls1 with near - eddington accretion rate .",
    "meanwhile , the nir slope of 1523 is @xmath179 , which is redder than those of most bal quasars ( see figure 2 in zhang et al .",
    "these statistical properties bring about the occurrence of the high - velocity outflow .    from table",
    "[ tab3 ] , we knew that only three of literature quasars are the balmer bals , and others are just the balmer nals .",
    "indeed , the absorption troughs of balmer and @xmath120 series can help us to straighten out the classification of bals .",
    "for example , there are suspected overlapping absorption features of in two objects , hall et al .",
    "( 2002 ) classified them into a special absorption subtype , the so - called many - narrow - trough felobal ( mntfelobal ) .",
    "however , the troughs of balmer and @xmath120 series present the true absorption profiles with narrow widths , and these profiles are used to model absorption multiplets ( shi et al . in pre . ) .",
    "the cloudy simulations provided the physical conditions of outflow gases for part of objects listed in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "it can be seen that almost all absorption lines are constrained to come from high density gases ( @xmath180 ) , and 1523 is among sources with the highest density except sdss j112526.12 + 002901.3 .",
    "the high density suggests that the outflow winds should survive in the inner region of the agn .",
    "the photoionization model gave an estimation of a distance of @xmath181 pc .",
    "the outflow winds in 1523 locate at such close from the central ionizing source which is slightly farther than that of belrs . in the disk wind scenarios ( murray et al .",
    "1995 ) , most photoionized clouds emerge from the accretion disk and accelerate outwards .",
    "the velocities of the clouds are assumed to be a function of the initial velocities , the terminal velocities and the radii that they are away from the center .",
    "the terminal velocities are approximately inversely proportional to the square root of the radius at which the streamlines .",
    "thus the innermost streamlines have the highest rotational and terminal radial velocities and highest ionization states .",
    "balmer absorption winds in 1523  are just located at the distance of @xmath181 pc from the central ionizing source .",
    "we suggest that is the reason why balmer bals in this objetc have very large outflow velocities .",
    "panel ( c ) of figure [ f2 ] shows that the minimum velocity of the bal troughs is @xmath182 km  s@xmath4 , that means the absorption winds have large initial velocities when they emerge , or they have been accelerated from ( inside ) the belrs .",
    "if the mass flux is continuous , the optical depths decrease as a function of the blueshifted velocity .",
    "if the outflow is gathering speed , it seems that the volumes of absorption winds expand gradually during acceleration outwards .",
    "that is consistent with the existence of the excess outflow component of uv 62 and bal troughs ( figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "this component shows higher blueshifted velocity ( @xmath183 km  s@xmath4 ) , larger covering factor ( @xmath184 ) and lower density ( @xmath185 ) , and is estimated to exist in remoter regions ( several tens of parsecs ) .",
    "in this work , we present the discovery of balmer - series absorption lines from h@xmath0 , h@xmath53 and h@xmath1 in 1523 from the quasi - simultaneous optical and near - infrared spectroscopy . the redshift of the balmer absorption troughs is @xmath186 , and it is blueshifted by @xmath187 km  s@xmath4with regard to the balmer emission lines .",
    "balmer bals have outflowing velocities a factor of two than the previously known balmer absorption lines .",
    "we searched for the same velocity components seen in other nir balmer absorption lines .",
    "we found a component in the @xmath130 absorption line at the same redshift .",
    "the absorption trough in @xmath130 has a uniform absorption profile with the balmer - series , with the absorption width @xmath188 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore 1523 is the object with the broadest balmer absorption lines detected so far .",
    "we measured the profiles of balmer bels and derived their widths of @xmath189 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the estimation of the fundamental parameters shows that 1523 is a typical nls1 with a low black hole mass but high accretion ratio .",
    "we approximately evaluate the bals by employing the cloudy in a extensive parameter space . the outflow winds of balmer bals are suggested to be of the electron density of @xmath190 , an ionization parameter of @xmath191 , and the distance of @xmath181 pc from the central ionizing source which is slightly farther than that of belrs .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of balmer line absorption from h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 in an iron low - ionization broad absorption line ( felobal ) quasar sdss j152350.42 + 391405.2 ( hereafter 1523 ) , by the quasi - simultaneous optical and near - infrared spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the balmer line absorption is at @xmath2 and blueshifted by @xmath3 km  s@xmath4with respect to the balmer emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> all balmer bals have uniform absorption profile with the widths of @xmath512,000 km  s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also found the absorption trough in * @xmath610830 with the same velocity and width in the @xmath7-band triplespec spectrum of 1523 . </S>",
    "<S> this object is only the tenth active galactic nucleus known to exhibit non - stellar balmer absorption , and also the case with the highest velocity and broadest balmer absorption lines which have ever been found . </S>",
    "<S> a cloudy analysis shows that the absorbers require an gas density of @xmath8 and an ionization parameter of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> they locate at a distance of @xmath10 pc from the central ionizing source which is slightly farther than that of belrs . furthermore </S>",
    "<S> , 1523 is one of the brightest balmer - bal quasar ever reported , with unique iron absorption variations , making it as the most promising candidate for follow up high - resolution spectroscopy , multi - band observations , and long - term monitoring . </S>"
