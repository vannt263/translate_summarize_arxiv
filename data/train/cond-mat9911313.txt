    "in the last few years , with the increase of computer power , many researchers have tried to unify two major but different approaches to the computation of electronic properties of materials : ( 1 ) the local density approximation ( lda ) to the kohn - sham equations@xcite where the correlation effects are included in an average way through the use of the parameterized local exchange - correlation potential.@xcite ( 2 ) many - body models based on simplified and parameterized hamiltonians omitting much of the subtlety of the chemical bonding but handling the correlation effects effectively .",
    "the aim of the unification being to provide a good description of the quasi - particles properties in _ real _ solids without omitting either the subtlety of chemical bonding or the correlated nature of the electrons.@xcite    that lda is inadequate has been known for example in the case of semiconductors : the lda band gaps are at least 50@xmath5 smaller than experimental values .",
    "it was shown by perdew and levy@xcite and sham and schlter@xcite that the difference between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied state of the density functional theory ( dft ) eigenvalues is not the true quasiparticle band gap , but differs from it by @xmath6 , the discontinuity in the exchange - correlation potential when an electron is added to the system .",
    "later , it was shown that quasiparticle calculation based on the the gw approximation ( gwa ) of hedin@xcite produced band gaps which were in good agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite this development in the theoretical study of the electronic structure of solids is the inclusion of many - body effects in the calculation , principally , through the computation of the quasiparticle self - energy and the results are an adjustment of the energy splittings obtained within the local density approximation.@xcite    after this initial success the gwa has been extensively used to study other properties of different type of materials : ( 1 ) the band - width narrowing in alkali - metals , and their clusters.@xcite ( 2 ) the surfaces states of semiconductors , i.e. , improving band gaps of surface states,@xcite looking for dimer buckling in si surfaces.@xcite ( 3 ) the effects of correlation on the valence off - set between different bulk semiconductors.@xcite ( 4 ) the character of the band gaps of superlattices and anisotropy of optical matrix elements.@xcite ( 5 ) the orientational disorder and photoemission spectra of solid c@xmath7.@xcite ( 6 ) the electronic properties of elemental ni and its energy loss spectra.@xcite ( 7 ) the quasiparticle properties of atoms using various gwa.@xcite ( 8) the schottky barrier between a metal and a semiconductor.@xcite ( 9 ) the inclusion of excitonic effects in the calculation of the dielectric function of semiconductors @xcite .",
    "all these different studies in a very short time established the gwa as a good ` first - principles ' method for computations of quasiparticle properties of real materials .    in most of these studies",
    "the plane wave expansion of the lda pseudopotential basis - set is used , which makes an analysis in terms of chemically relevant orbitals difficult .",
    "an additional difficulty with doing the gwa to the self - energy in a plane wave basis set is that the computational effort for systems with localized electrons is enormous since the plane wave expansion of the wave function becomes a real problem especially for systems of localized electrons or low dimensional materials .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new implementation of the gwa based on an all - electron method using the recently developed all - electron projector augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite our constructed ab - initio method of quasiparticles is then based on the framework of the lda theory in conjunction with the paw method .",
    "the knowledge of the one - electron green function provided by the paw method allows us to construct the quasiparticle self - energy within the gwa , in which the dynamical screening of the electron - electron interaction arises from a plasmon model dielectric function@xcite for which the parameters are adjusted to the dielectric function calculated in the random - phase - approximation @xcite ( rpa ) .",
    "the full calculation of systems of many atoms in the unit cell is prohibitive on sequential computers , so we had to parallelize our numerical code so that the calculations become feasible on scalable parallel architectures .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the fist part we introduce the projector augmented wave method which is used to solve the kohn - sham equations and provides the one - electron green s function and the rpa dielectric function which are then used to compute the self - energy .",
    "we then describe our gw implementation based on the paw method and show the difficulties , traps , encountered when implementing an all - electron gwa .",
    "in particular , we mention the difficulty related to the decoupling of the core and valence electrons .",
    "we discuss also in details the use of symmetry to reduce the computational time of the self - energy and the dielectric function , as well as the parallelization of our numerical code . in the third section",
    "we apply our method to determine the electronic structure of two distinct semiconductor groups : some small and medium - band - gap semiconductors : si , gaas , alas , inp , mg@xmath3si and some large - band - gap semiconductors ( insulator ) : c , and ( licl ) .",
    "we then compare our results with available gwa calculations and experiments .",
    "in the density functional theory implemented in the framework of the lda @xcite , an electronic structure calculation requires the solution of kohn - sham type of equations in a self consistent way .",
    "the computation of material s band structure consists in finding the bloch wave functions @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote a band index and a wave vector in the brillouin zone , respectively . in the projector",
    "augmented plane wave ( paw ) formalism , @xcite all calculations are performed on a smooth  pseudo \" wave function @xmath11 which is expressed as a linear combination of plane waves .",
    "the passage from the smooth pseudo - wave function to the all - electron wave function exhibiting the correct nodal behavior in the augmentation regions ( spheres centered on each atom ) is achieved by defining three atomic type of functions in each augmentation region : ( 1 ) the all - electron basis functions @xmath12 , ( 2 ) the pseudo basis functions @xmath13 , ( 3 ) the projector functions @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the orbital and magnetic quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath18 is introduced to leave the opportunity of choosing more than one function for each angular momentum channel @xmath19 .",
    "these functions are defined so that : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the radii of non - overlapping spheres centered at each atomic site @xmath22 .",
    "the projector functions vanish for @xmath23 and satisfy the orthogonality property : @xmath24 using these functions , the all - electron wave function @xmath25 can be deduced from the pseudo wave function @xmath26 according to the relation @xmath27 with    @xmath28 \\langle \\tilde{p}_{i}^{a}|   \\tilde{\\psi}_{n { \\bf k}}\\rangle\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 denotes the atomic position of the atom @xmath22 in the unit cell .",
    "it is useful to point out the fact that @xmath30 vanishes in the interstitial region and defines the quantity necessary to describe the true wave function in the augmentation regions while @xmath31 describes the true wave function in the interstitial region .",
    "the paw formalism is designed to easily calculate the expectation value of local or semi - local observables .",
    "for example the expectation value of an operator @xmath32 between two bloch wave functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be calculated as a sum of three contributions : @xmath35 where @xmath36 this contribution is evaluated in the plane wave basis set .",
    "the last two contributions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are evaluated in the augmentation regions .",
    "blchl@xcite managed to decompose the total valence energy into three contributions in complete analogy with the decomposition of the expectation value of an operator @xmath39 where @xmath40 includes the kinetic energy of the valence electrons , the interaction energy with the nuclei having atomic number @xmath41 and with the core electrons , which are described in the frozen core approximation , the hartree energy and the exchange correlation energy of the valence electrons .    minimizing the total energy with respect to the @xmath31 ( variationnal principle ) leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem which is solved in a self - consistent way , giving the pseudo wave functions @xmath31 from which the all - electron wave functions @xmath33 are easily deduced by means of equation [ decomposition ] .",
    "solving the kohn - sham equations , where the exchange - correlation effects are included in a mean way in an exchange - correlation potential @xmath42 yields to eigenvalues which can not be assimilated to the excitation energies of the solids .",
    "indeed , there is nt any koopman s theorem for the kohn - sham theory and these eigenvalues only have meaning as lagrange parameters .",
    "the green s function theory is a good tool for properly describing the excitation energies . in the quasiparticle approximation",
    ", we can find the excitation energies of the system by solving a quasiparticle equation @xmath43 instead of locating the poles of the green s function . here , t is the kinetic energy operator ( @xmath44 in atomic units ) , @xmath45 is the external ( ionic ) potential , @xmath46 is the hartree potential due to the average coulomb repulsion of the electrons and @xmath47 is the self - energy operator which summarizes the many - body effects .",
    "@xmath47 is in general a non local , energy - dependent , non - hermitian operator .",
    "the non - hermitian part of @xmath47 gives rise to complex eigenvalues @xmath48 .",
    "the real part of the eigenvalue is associated with the energy of the quasiparticle while the imaginary part is related to the inverse of the lifetime of the quasiparticle .",
    "fortunately , the imaginary part of the eigenvalue , which can be attributed to the possibility for the quasiparticle to lower its energy via particle - hole formations ( the decay of the quasiparticle via emission or absorption of plasmons is not effective near the fermi level ) , becomes small near the fermi level because of the restriction of the phase space for these processes .",
    "this is known as pauli blocking .",
    "so , the quasiparticle concept is effective near the fermi level .",
    "the similitude between the quasiparticle equation and the familiar self - consistent field equation in the kohn - sham formulation of the density - functional theory @xmath49 is striking if we set @xmath50 in the quasiparticle equation .",
    "so the kohn - sham equation can be regarded as an approximation to the quasiparticle equation where the self - energy is approximated by a local and energy - independent potential .    a more realistic , but relatively simple approximation to the self - energy , which takes into account both non - locality and dynamic correlations , known as the gw approximation ( gwa ) ,",
    "was initiated by hedin @xcite .",
    "this approximation was originally derived from a many - body perturbation theory as the first term in the expansion of the self - energy in the screened interaction w. within this scheme , the self - energy @xmath51 is approximated by a convolution with respect to the frequency variable of the green s function with the screened interaction along the real axis . here",
    "@xmath52 is a positive infinitesimal which ensures that only the poles of the green s function associated to occupied states contribute to the integral , @xmath53 is the best available green s function and @xmath1 is the best available screened coulomb interaction .",
    "accordingly , @xmath53 is taken to be the green s function built from lda orbitals @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the chemical potential , and where @xmath56 means @xmath52 being a positive infinitesimal number .",
    "the dynamically screened interaction is defined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the bare coulomb interaction and @xmath59 the dielectric function defined by @xmath60 where the irreducible polarisability @xmath61 is calculated within the rpa approximation ( bubble approximation ) @xmath62 using the lda expression of the green s function and integrating in the complex plane leads to the familiar expression of the irreducible polarisability @xmath63\\psi_{{\\bf k}l}({\\bf r } ) \\psi_{{\\bf k}l}^*({\\bf r}^{\\prime})\\psi_{{\\bf k}^{\\prime}m}({\\bf r}^{\\prime } ) \\psi_{{\\bf k}^{\\prime}m}^*({\\bf r}^{\\prime } ) } { \\epsilon_l({\\bf k})-\\epsilon_m({\\bf k}^{\\prime } ) -\\omega+i\\delta[n_l({\\bf k})-n_m({\\bf k}^{\\prime})]}\\ ] ] after having defined the different quantities , which enter the self - energy in the gw approximation , it is natural to look for the solution of the quasiparticle equation along the following line @xmath64 it has been shown by inspection that , @xmath65 , which means that the quasiparticle hamiltonian is virtually diagonal in the @xmath66 basis for semiconductors such as si@xcite .",
    "a plausible argument for neglecting the non - diagonal part has been given recently by hedin.@xcite since the quasiparticle wave functions @xmath67 are similar to the lda wave functions @xmath66 ( the overlap between the quasiparticle wave function and the lda wave function is about 99 % @xcite ) , the numerical work is therefore considerably reduced .",
    "indeed , using first order perturbation theory yields the following result : @xmath68 in principle , the solution to this equation should be obtained via an iterative method , but expanding eq .",
    "( [ quasiparticle_energy ] ) to first order in energy around @xmath69 yields accurate numerical results .",

    "values of @xmath71 about 0.8 imply that we still have well - defined quasiparticles in the system but that 20 percents of the spectral weight is now distributed over a range of frequencies .      as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ quasiparticle_energy_final ] ) , the central problem of this scheme consists in evaluating the diagonal matrix elements of the self - energy between lda orbitals .",
    "the quantities which enter the self - energy are functions @xmath74 of two locations @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these functions have the following translational symmetry property @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a bravais lattice vector .",
    "then , we can fix the fourier transform convention for such functions @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a wave vector in the first brillouin zone , @xmath81 a reciprocal lattice vector and @xmath82 the crystal volume .    in the plane wave basis",
    ", the dielectric function can be defined as @xmath83 then according to eqs .",
    "( [ self_energy ] and [ screened_interaction ] ) , the dielectric matrices @xmath84 have to be calculated and inverted for many values of @xmath85 . this is computationally time consuming .",
    "nevertheless , it has been carried out by some authors@xcite who choose to evaluate the frequency integral by using a gaussian integration scheme along the imaginary axis to circumvent the problem of the pole structure of the screened interaction along the real frequency axis@xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is the use of a plasmon pole model@xcite to mimic the frequency dependence of the dielectric matrix .",
    "these models give a good description of the low frequency behavior of the dynamically screened interaction and allow the determination of an analytic expression for the frequency integral appearing in eq .",

    "we have used the message passing interface ( mpi ) to parallelize our numerical code on an ibm sp2 . the most straitforward parallelization which we were able to perform was any loop or a summation involving * k*-point mesh over the brillouin zone .",

    "this trend has been confirmed for the other semiconductors studied in this paper and was already mentioned in the seminal work of hedin @xcite on the jellium model .",
