    "knowledge of the low luminosity members of the galaxy  the red dwarfs , subdwarfs , brown dwarfs , and white dwarfs ( wds )  comes largely from the nearest representatives of each class because they are the easiest to study .",
    "magnitude - limited surveys of these objects allow us to develop crucial nearby samples that reveal ground truths about stellar populations .",
    "the most straightforward technique to confirm proximity , to amass population statistics , and to better constrain physical parameters is precision astrometry , specifically trigonometric parallax determinations such as those presented in this paper .",
    "the subjects of this paper , wds , are perhaps the most reliable chronometers of galactic history available to astronomers .",
    "they also are valuable tracers of galactic populations of different ages , e.g. , the thin disk , thick disk , and halo . in addition , given that @xmath295% of all stars will end their lives as wds , the amount of mass contained within wds as a population may already be substantial and will continue to increase , possibly comprising a significant fraction of the current ( and future ) missing mass in the galaxy .",

    ", we also model nearby wds to determine accurate physical parameters , as well as evaluate population statistics for wds in the solar neighborhood .",
    "spectral signatures and photometric spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are reproduced remarkably well by model atmospheres for most wds . however ,",
    "a few exceptional wds , particularly the coolest members , remain problematic . here we present accurate parallaxes for two very cool and low luminosity wds in the solar neighborhood to provide empirical test cases for advancements in atmospheric modeling .",
    "previous trigonometric parallax efforts have catalogued a total of 112 wd systems within 25 pc , using no uncertainty constraints .",
    "a wd system is defined as any single or multiple stellar system containing at least one wd . the majority of these systems are included in the yale parallax catalog @xcite with recent additions from the _ hipparcos _ space astrometry mission @xcite as well as ground - based parallax programs and companion searches ( see table [ wdsample ] ) .",
    "a comprehensive table containing the current 25 pc wd sample has been compiled as part of the dense ( discovery and evaluation of nearby stellar embers ) project and can be found at http://www.denseproject.com . surprisingly , only three wd parallaxes within 25 pc have been measured and published since the _ hipparcos _ catalog was first released more than a decade ago @xcite .    to ensure a reliable nearby wd sample ,",
    "we have adopted the quality limit for inclusion into the sample that the trigonometric parallax error can not be larger than 10% of the parallax . at 25 pc ,",
    "this limit amounts to an error of 4.0 mas .",
    "given the @xmath22 mas or better precision of ground - based parallaxes , this limit is entirely reasonable for the 25 pc sample . applying this constraint ,",
    "13 systems are eliminated from the 25 pc wd sample , thus setting the total number of wd systems with reliable parallaxes within 25 pc to 99 .         with the north and south galactic poles labeled as `` ngp '' and `` sgp '' , respectively .",
    "the thick line is the galactic plane with the galactic center and the galactic anticenter labeled as `` gc '' and `` gac '' , respectively .",
    "the encircled dot is the direction of the apex of solar motion and the encircled cross is the direction of the antapex of solar motion.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to gauge the degree of incompleteness for the 25 pc wd sample , we make two basic assumptions , ( 1 ) that the 10 pc wd sample is complete , and ( 2 ) that the local density of wds out to 25 pc is constant . as is evident in figure [ incomplete ] , just over one - third of the wd systems expected within 25 pc have trigonometric parallaxes placing them within that volume .",
    "a staggering @xmath263% are missing and this is merely a lower limit .",
    "if additional wds are found within 10 pc ( such as the two presented here ) , the constant density curve shifts vertically upwards and increases the number of wds expected within 25 pc .",
    "the small number of known wds within 10 pc ( 17 systems ) presents a fairly large uncertainty when extrapolating out to 25 pc solely because of small number statistics .",
    "however , the fact remains that the sample is significantly incomplete . while there are a number of known wds likely within 25 pc",
    "that do not yet have trigonometric parallaxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there remains the need for a sizable sample of nearby , as yet undiscovered , wds to close the incompleteness gap .",
    "the sky distribution of this sample of 99 wd systems is fairly homogeneous ( see figure [ skyplotnew ] ) .",
    "however , if the sky is divided into four equal - area segments by declination , it is clear that the southern hemisphere is significantly undersampled in terms of nearby wd systems  as shown in table [ skydist ] there are 63 systems in the north vs.  36 systems in the south prior to the inclusion of the results presented here .",
    "in fact , the southernmost region is @xmath250% complete when compared to the northernmost region and , given that the 25 pc wd sample in the northernmost region is likely not complete , this is an upper limit .",
    "thus , the southern hemisphere provides rich hunting grounds to identify new nearby wds for which our southern hemisphere parallax program , the cerro tololo inter - american observatory parallax investigation ( ctiopi ) , is ideally suited .",
    "in general , there is an observational bias in that higher proper motion objects are scrutinized first because they are more likely to have larger parallaxes .",
    "thus , there may exist a substantial number of wds with low proper motions that remains to be discovered , which may comprise a significant fraction of missing nearby wd systems . in order to evaluate empirically whether this proposition is plausible , we compared this sample to a subset of the _ hipparcos _ catalog .",
    "our intention was to evaluate the proper motion distribution of a complete sample within 25 pc .",
    "given that this catalog is complete to @xmath3 7.3 - 9.0 , we targeted all stars within 25 pc later than a0 ( assuming @xmath4 0.6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) down to an apparent v magnitude of 7.5 ( @xmath4 5.5 , hence late g type dwarfs ) .",
    "a constraint was used to remove evolved stars from the sample by defining a line @xmath21 mag above the locus of the main sequence in the h - r diagram and excluding those objects with brighter absolute magnitudes .",
    "the resulting sift included a total of 325 stars , of which 51 ( @xmath216% ) had proper motions less than 0@xmath515 yr@xmath6 , which is the detection limit of @xcite and well below the detection limits of other proper motion surveys.1 yr@xmath6 ; however , they employed color constraints in search of late - type dwarfs that would eliminate wds from their sample . ]",
    "thus , it seems the 25 pc wd sample is deficient in members with low proper motions because only 5 of the 99 systems known before this paper have @xmath7 0@xmath515 yr@xmath6 .",
    "age effects , leading to larger velocity dispersions for older populations ( e.g. , wds ) , are not taken into account that could potentially alter these statistics , but likely not by the factor of roughly three necessary to resolve the discrepancy .",

    "the aspens effort monitors most red dwarfs within 10 pc and white dwarfs within 15 pc in the southern hemisphere to search for astrometric signals indicative of unseen companions .",
    "the data are acquired in exactly the same manner as the parallax data except over longer time spans and perhaps with increased cadence .",
    "in addition to probing for astrometric wobbles , these data allow us to redetermine trigonometric parallaxes for nearby wds that are often significantly more accurate than were previously available .",
    "ironically , while the southern hemisphere is undersampled with respect to the 25 pc wd sample , the majority of 10 pc wd systems are in the south ( 11 of 17 ) .",

    "even the reference stars trace out small parallax ellipses because these stars are not infinitely far away .",
    "thus , a correction to absolute parallax must be performed .",
    "this is accomplished in one of ( at least ) three different ways , ( 1 ) using a model of the galaxy for the disk and halo , ( 2 ) spectroscopic parallaxes for each of the reference stars , or ( 3 ) photometric parallaxes for each of the reference stars . because accurate photometry is needed for dcr correction and",
    "is already available , we use photometric parallaxes for the reference stars to correct to absolute parallax using the ccd distance relations of @xcite .",
    "these relations assume the reference stars are single main - sequence dwarfs and do not take into account contamination from evolved stars , unresolved double stars , or reddening .",
    "we identify and remove outlying points estimated to be within @xmath2100 pc due either to evolved stars or unresolved double stars whose distances are underestimated .",
    "given that all of the wds presented here are relatively nearby , pi star reddening is negligible .",
    "however , the distant reference stars can be reddened and appear to be closer than they truly are .",
    "this is the case for two wd fields ( wd 1223@xmath10659 and wd 1647@xmath10327 ) for which we have adopted an average correction to absolute of 1.2 mas ( based on all other wd fields presented here ) with a conservative error of 0.3 mas ( consistent with the largest absolute correction errors presented here ) .      during the course of ctiopi , hundreds of parallaxes ( both preliminary and definitive ) have been reduced .",
    "based on our experience with the `` evolution '' of the parallaxes as more data are added , we have set limits that define when a reduction is sufficient to be deemed definitive and hence publishable . in order to accurately decouple the parallactic and proper motions in the final astrometric solution , observations must span at least two years and adequately sample the parallax ellipse ( including high parallax factor observations ) .",
    "also , there must be a balance between negative parallax factor observations and positive parallax factor observations and typically at least 20 good frames of each are required .",
    "at least two and ideally three @xmath23 photometry observations per pi star are necessary to ensure accurate photometry needed to correct for dcr as well as to absolute parallax .",
    "finally , the parallax error must be less than 3.0 mas .",
    "this constraint was set early on during the program and with the use of the new centroiding algorithm ( see next section ) is typically an easy requirement to meet .",
    "beginning with _ sextractor _ version 2.4 , the authors implemented windowed positional parameters .",
    "these serve to alleviate a number of the inherent inaccuracies of the isophotal positional parameters used for centroiding in previous versions of _ sextractor _ ( see _ sextractor _",

    "the authors analogize the positional accuracy of the gaussian - weighted two - dimensional windowed centroids to that offered by point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting .",
    "after extensive testing on dozens of pi stars from the ctiopi program , we found that windowed centroids were clearly superior to the isophotal centroids used in our previous reductions , including those published in @xcite and @xcite from the 0.9 m . on average ,",
    "parallax errors were reduced by @xmath250% with no appreciable change in the parallax ( when pi star contamination was not present ) using the same data sets in both reductions . in extreme cases , particularly in crowded fields , parallax errors were reduced by factors of two or more .",
    "this was the case with the parallax reduction for wd 0751@xmath10252 , which had a contaminating source within 1@xmath50 . using the isophotal centroids , the preliminary parallax determination was 68.6 @xmath22 3.5 mas with clear trends in the residuals indicative of contamination .",
    "using the windowed centroids and the same data set , the parallax determination was 55.8 @xmath22 1.0 mas with residuals that hovered near zero throughout the data 0.95 mas presented here , hence the slightly different value in table [ astrometry ] . ] . as an additional check",

    "we obtain an average parallax error of 1.10 mas for the sample presented here using windowed centroids ( excluding wd 0628@xmath10020 and wd 2351@xmath10335 because the observations were optimized for their red dwarf companions and as such , the exposure times were shorter and the wd components were underexposed ) .",

    "<S> we present accurate trigonometric parallaxes for 20 new members of the 25 pc white dwarf sample as part of the dense project ( discovery and evalution of nearby stellar embers , http://www.denseproject.com ) . </S>",
    "<S> previously , there were a total of 112 white dwarf systems with trigonometric parallaxes placing them within 25 pc and of these , 99 have trigonometric parallaxes known to better than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the 20 new members presented in this work represent a 20% increase in the number of white dwarfs accurately known to be within 25 pc . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we present updated parallaxes for seven known white dwarfs within 10 pc that have been observed as part of the aspens initiative ( astrometric search for planets encircling nearby stars ) to monitor nearby southern red and white dwarfs for astrometric perturbations from unseen companions . including a few white dwarf companions and white dwarfs beyond 25 pc , we present a total of 33 trigonometric parallaxes . </S>",
    "<S> we perform atmospheric modeling for white dwarfs to determine physical parameters ( i.e. , @xmath0 , log @xmath1 , mass , and white dwarf age ) . finally , a new zz ceti pulsating white dwarf was identified and revised constraints are placed on two mixed h / he atmosphere cool white dwarfs that display continuum absorption in the near - infrared . </S>"
