    "spiral density waves and spiral bending waves , generated in a disk by resonant interactions with perturbing moons , are a pervasive and useful feature in saturn s rings ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the very first spiral wave ever reported in saturn s rings , confirming the prediction of @xcite that the spiral phenomena well - known in galaxies should also appear in planetary rings , was described by @xcite from _ voyager _  1 imaging data and identified as the iapetus  1:0 apsidal density wave .",

    "we report here that the long - lost iapetus wave was pointed out for the first time in 29 years in _ cassini _ images taken during 2009 . as when _ voyager _  1 discovered this wave , saturn was close to equinox at the time the wave was recovered .",
    "the _ voyager _  1 flyby of 1980  november  12 was eight months after the 1980  march  3 equinox , and similarly , the iapetus wave is most prominent in images taken within about a year of the 2009  august  11 equinox .",

    "then we describe our observations in section  [ observations ] and our wavelet analysis of the iapetus nodal bending wave in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "discussion of our results and their implications for the outer cassini division and inner  a ring is contained in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the two most prominent components of saturn s ring system are the a  ring and the b  ring .",
    "they are separated by the cassini division , named for its 17th - century discoverer , which turns out to be a multifaceted ring region in its own right , similar in character to the inner and equally tenuous c  ring ( fig .",
    "[ contextfig1 ] ) .",
    "surface densities in the main part of the cassini division are 1  to 3  g  @xmath1 @xcite , much lower than the characteristic values of 40  g  @xmath1 for the a  ring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the even higher values characteristic of the b  ring @xcite .",
    "the outermost part of the cassini division is the `` ramp , '' so called because both the optical depth @xmath2 and the apparent brightness[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath3 in this region increase gradually with ring radius from the low values of the main part of the cassini division , reaching relatively higher values at the inner edge of the a  ring , at which both parameters then jump to much higher values ( fig .",
    "[ contextfig2 ] ) .",
    "infrared spectroscopy indicates that the composition of material in the ramp has more in common with the a  ring than it does with the main part of the cassini division @xcite .",
    "a very similar ramp marks the outermost regions of the c  ring , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 rising with ring radius toward the inner edge of the b  ring @xcite",
    ".    the inner edge of the a  ring is traditionally marked at a sharp jump in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 occurring at 122,050  km from saturn s center ( fig .",
    "[ contextfig2 ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "it has heretofore been presumed that there is a correspondingly sharp jump in surface density @xmath4 at the same location , as that is the most straightforward explanation for a higher @xmath2 .",
    "although there is no clear reason why there should be a boundary of any kind at this location,[multiblock footnote omitted ] it was suggested by @xcite that , once formed , any boundary would be sharpened via ballistic transport due to bombardment of the ring by interplanetary meteoroids .",
    "a few hundred km outward of the a  ring s inner edge is a second sharp jump in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 , this one at the location of the pandora 5:4 lindblad resonance at 122,313  km , which drives a strong density wave .",
    "outward of this resonant location is a region several thousand  km in annular width , characterized by seemingly chaotic radial structure ( fig .",
    "[ contextfig2 ] ) that may be due to viscous overstability @xcite , a process by which an over - active restoring force causes small perturbations in density to grow into concentric radial structure with wavelengths @xmath0100  m @xcite .",
    "the janus / epimetheus  4:3 resonance at @xmath0125,250  km marks the outer boundary of the chaotic / overstable region , beyond which is the relatively quiescent mid - a  ring .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ iawave_profile ] , the appearance of this region is greatly altered in the equinox images .",
    "the optical depth structure that usually dominates the apparent brightnes ( fig .",
    "[ contextfig2 ] ) is greatly washed out due to the edge - on illumination , and the apparent brightness is instead dominated by a quasi - periodic pattern generated by the vertical corrugation of the bending wave ( illustrated in fig .  [ bendingwavecartoon ] ) .",
    "spiral waves @xcite occur in planetary rings at locations of resonance between an external forcing frequency , usually a moon s mean motion @xmath5 ( that is , its average angular velocity ) , and the natural orbital frequencies of ring particles . the most widespread understood structure in saturn s rings are _ spiral density waves _ ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , in which the eccentricities of ring particles on resonant orbits are pumped up , leading to a compression wave in which both particle motions and wave propagation are radial.[multiblock footnote omitted ] also significant are _ spiral bending waves _",
    "( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which it is the inclinations of resonant ring particles that are pumped up , leading to a transverse wave that also propagates radially but with particle motions in the vertical direction .",
    "spiral waves occur at locations where the ring particle mean motion @xmath6 is near an integer ratio ( such as 3:2 , 5:3 , or 10:9 ) with the perturbing moon s mean motion @xmath5 .",
    "this is formally expressed in terms of the resonance argument @xmath7 , which librates about a constant value ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) for particles in the resonance . the most prominent class of resonances in saturn s rings are first - order ( i.e.",
    ", the two integers differ only by one ) , with the rings interior to the perturbing moon . for a spiral density wave of this type ,",
    "@xmath9 is of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an integer identifying[multiblock footnote omitted ] the @xmath11:(@xmath11 - 1 ) resonance , and @xmath12 is the ring particle s apsidal precession rate.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the resonance argument for spiral bending waves is similar , but with the ring particle s nodal precession rate @xmath13 instead of @xmath12 .",
    "the precession rates are non - zero because saturn s asphericity , whose effect on the gravity field is described to first order by the parameter @xmath14 , causes a ring particle s radial and vertical frequencies to differ from its mean motion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , there is an unusual class of spiral waves for which @xmath6 does not appear in the relevant equations ; these are driven by commensurability between the perturbing moon s mean motion and the ring particle s precession alone .",
    "the simplest of these is an _",
    "apsidal density wave _ , driven by a simple commensurability between the perturber s mean motion @xmath5 and the ring particle s apsidal precession rate @xmath12 , which is to say that the long axis of the ring particle s elliptical orbit points toward the perturbing moon.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the resonance argument is simply @xmath15 which naturally leads to the resonance being labeled `` 1:0 , '' after the respective integer coefficients of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with reference to eq .",
    "[ resargdw ] . a similar commensurability involving @xmath5 and the ring particle nodal precession rate",
    "@xmath13 leads to the _ nodal bending wave _",
    "@xcite , in which it is the ring particle s orbit plane that precesses in time with the perturber s mean motion .",
    "however , for an oblate planet such as saturn , nodes precess `` backwards '' ( i.e. @xmath16 ) ; thus,[multiblock footnote omitted ] the simplest argument that constitutes a valid resonance is @xmath17 while interpreting eq .",
    "[ resargnbw ] , keep in mind that the middle two terms are very small compared to the outer two , since apsidal and nodal resonances involve perturbing moons that are so far from the planet that their orbital rates are comparable to the precession rates of ring particle orbits , but that both @xmath13 and @xmath18 are negative . again following ( one might say _ ad absurdam _ )",
    "the system for labeling resonances and their spiral waves based on the integer coefficients of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the nodal resonance is labeled `` -1:0 . ''    because of the `` backwardness '' inherent in the nodal resonance , nodal bending waves propagate radially outward ( when the perturber is outward of the rings , as is the case for all resonances discussed in this work ) as do density waves , rather than inward as do other bending waves . furthermore , because the frequencies involved with apsidal and nodal resonances are much lower than for other wave - producing resonances ( due to the absence of the ring particle s mean motion in @xmath9 ) , their waves have much longer wavelengths than typical spiral waves and are excited by moons orbiting much farther from saturn .",
    "indeed , while typical spiral waves are excited by the inner moons pan , atlas , prometheus , pandora , janus , epimetheus , and mimas , the only known moons whose apsidal and nodal resonances fall within the main rings are titan , hyperion , and iapetus . of these",
    ", titan s apsidal resonance governs an eccentric ringlet in the mid - c  ring @xcite while its nodal bending wave is nearby @xcite , hyperion s waves are weak but have been seen in the outer - c  ring and will be discussed in another publication by m.  s.  tiscareno and b.  e.  harris ( in preparation ) , and iapetus waves are the subject of this work .      because their low amplitudes fall far short of saturating the background , all spiral waves considered in this work follow the linear theory @xcite , relevant parts of which we now reproduce .",
    "mindful of some variations among authors , we largely follow the notation of @xcite , as @xcite did with more comment .",
    "the dispersion relation for an apsidal spiral density wave is @xmath19 ^ 2 = [ n(r ) - \\dot{\\varpi}(r)]^2 - 2 \\pi g \\sigma_\\mathrm{b } | k(r ) | , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is newton s constant , @xmath21 is the background surface density , and @xmath6 and @xmath12 and the wavenumber @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the spatial wavelength ) are functions of the radial location @xmath24 . similarly , the dispersion relation for a nodal spiral bending wave is @xmath25 ^ 2 = [ n(r ) - \\dot{\\omega}(r)]^2 - 2 \\pi g \\sigma_\\mathrm{b } | k(r ) | .\\ ] ] both these dispersion relations can be linearized to @xmath26 is the radial location of the resonance and @xmath27 for @xmath28 resonances @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are always positive in the @xmath28 case , we can combine eqs .",

[ wavenumbereqn3 ] that @xmath37 is constant .",
    "most spiral waves in saturn s rings span a small enough region that this assumption is robust , such that @xmath21 can be obtained by finding the slope of a line fit to @xmath38 , as has been done by several workers with _ cassini _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "some of the complex waves due to the co - orbital moons janus and epimetheus were fit using a different method by @xcite .",
    "the waves discussed in this work , on the other hand , span large regions of this disk , over which the background surface density varies widely . in this case , as a consequence of the wkb approximation that underlies linear spiral wave theory @xcite , we can still use eq .",
    "[ wavenumbereqn3 ] with the measured wavenumber @xmath38 at each radial location giving the local surface density @xmath39 .",
    "the iapetus nodal bending wave is visible in _ cassini _  iss images taken during an interval broadly extending from 2008 to  2010 , when the solar incidence angle @xmath40 was within several degrees of @xmath41 ( though it was not noticed until it became very prominent in images taken in spring  2009 ) .",
    "the feature is more prominent as @xmath40 approaches @xmath41 ( equinox ) , so we concentrate our analysis on two images taken during orbit  116 , with portions of the sun s disk on both sides of the ring plane .",

    "it is clear that this feature is the -1:0 nodal bending wave , rather than the 1:0 apsidal density wave as claimed by @xcite , not only because of the strong dependence of its visibility on the solar incidence angle , but also because fig .",
    "[ iawave_wavelet ] shows the first full wavelength of the outward - propagating wave , as well as much power in the wavelet transform , occuring inward of the iapetus  1:0 apsidal resonance .",
    "it should be noted that the _ voyager _ imaging data used by @xcite may have had insufficient spatial resolution to clearly make this distinction , and also that they wrote before @xcite first worked out the theory of nodal bending waves .    a harmonic signal can be seen in the wavelet transform ( fig .",
    "[ iawave_wavelet ] ) between 121,300  km and 122,200  km , with wavenumbers exactly twice that of the main signal .",
    "this is a numerical artifact that arises because the signal is not perfectly sinusoidal @xcite .",
    "as described by @xcite , the most accurate way to track the changing wavenumber of a quasi - sinusoidal signal is to analyze the wavelet phase @xmath50  which essentially measures the respective proximity of local peaks and troughs  at each location , after first zeroing out the wavelet transform for wavenumbers lower than the desired signal ( fig .",
    "[ iawave_waveletphase]a ) .",
    "the latter is a form of high - pass filter that removes unwanted long - wavelength structure .",
    "the wavelet phase is `` unwrapped '' to yield a monotonically increasing function of radius ( fig .",
    "[ iawave_waveletphase]b ) , and the wavenumber is then calculated as @xmath51 and converted to the local surface density @xmath21 by means of eq .  [ wavenumbereqn3 ] .",
    "the resulting estimates of local surface density @xmath39 are shown in fig .",
    "[ iawave_protosigmamodel ] .",
    "the local scatter is due primarily to residual oscillations in @xmath50 that arise because the signal is not perfectly sinusoidal , as well as gaussian variation in @xmath50 , both of which are amplified by the derivative used to calculate @xmath38 and then @xmath39 . in order to convert these data into a model that can be used for further analysis , smoothing out the scatter while preserving the sharp discontinuity at the pandora  5:4 resonance location , we fit the data by several piecewise linear fits , as described in fig .",
    "[ iawave_protosigmamodel ] .",

    "our derived @xmath39 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ iawave_sigmamodel ] along with independent measurements of @xmath21 at certain locations as ascertained by means of other spiral density waves[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( keep in mind that the nodal bending wave has much longer wavelengths and covers much more territory than common spiral waves , as described in section  [ spiralwaves ] ) .",

    "[ wavenumbereqn3 ] is overplotted on the wavelet transform in fig .",
    "[ iawave_wavelet ] .    the mass extinction coefficient @xmath52 measures the ring s light - blocking ability per unit surface density .",
    "higher values of @xmath53 , indicating more light - blocking surface area for a given surface density , are most simply achieved by breaking the mass into smaller particles .",
    "contrariwise , lower values of @xmath53 are most simply achieved by concentrating the mass into large particles or clumps .",
    "the mass extinction coefficient as derived by this work is placed in the context of previous observations in fig .",
    "[ mecfig ] and clarifies the situation considerably .",
    "it is now evident that the cassini division ramp is a region of particularly low @xmath53 , as much as 10x lower than in the main part of the cassini division , while values of @xmath53 in the inner - a  ring are intermediate and trend gently lower into the mid - a  ring .          while it has been commonly repeated that the pandora  5:4 density wave has the longest train of any in the a  ring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in fact it can be seen in fig .  [ pandora54 ] that only the inner @xmath0100  km of the oscillations have significant power in the @xmath54 pattern that is characteristic of propagating density waves .",
    "the remaining several thousand  km of high - frequency structure does not show any evidence of frequencies related to the pandora  5:4 density wave .",
    "furthermore , given the surface density model shown in fig .",
    "[ pandora54 ] , the wavelength of the pandora  5:4 wave would reach values as small as tens of meters , if indeed it propagated all the way to the outer edge of the high - frequency region at 125,250  km .    rather , it is likely that the pandora  5:4 wave merely serves as the inner boundary of a region marked by high spatial frequencies ( as well as high surface densities ) that are likely due to viscous overstability @xcite and perhaps other processes . whether this spatial arrangement occurs through causality or simply by coincidence",
    "is not clear .",
    "because lindblad resonances transfer negative angular momentum into the disk , it should not be possible for the pandora  5:4 wave to actively maintain the mass shelf at its location ( as , for example , the mimas  2:1 and janus / epimetheus  7:6 resonances respectively maintain the _ outer _ edges of the b  and a  rings ) . on the other hand , the strong oscillations of the pandora  5:4 density wave may play a role in triggering the viscous overstability in a region that , for other reasons , is susceptible to it .",
    "the lack of a sharp jump in surface density at the inner edge of the a  ring ( fig .",
    "[ iawave_sigmamodel ] ) is surprising and difficult to explain .",
    "what could drive the observed sharp jump in optical depth , if not the surface density ?",
    "in other words , what could drive a sharp jump in the mass extinction coefficient  @xmath53 at that location ( fig .",
    "[ mecfig ] ) ?",
    "one way for the optical depth to change sharply with only a modest trend in surface density is if the surface density were to pass through a threshold value at which self - gravity wakes ( sgws ) `` turned on . ''",
    "indeed , sgws do exist throughout the inner a  ring but not in the cassini division ramp @xcite .",
    "sgws , which are pervasive clumps due to a gravitational instability that is not strong enough to run completely to accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can indeed have a sudden onset as well as a strong effect on the mass extinction coefficient @xcite .",
    "however , the observed effect is in the wrong direction , as the onset of sgws would be triggered by rising surface density and would _ decrease _ the optical depth for a given surface density .",
    "therefore , sgws can not answer the puzzle posed by our findings .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of these observations is that the inner - a  ring is composed of smaller particles ( on average ) than the cassini division ramp , while the main part of the cassini division is composed of still smaller particles .",
    "why the cassini division ramp would have such large particles , and why there would be a sharp boundary in the particle - size distribution , is not clear .",
    "ballistic transport @xcite may conceivably operate to sharpen an edge in optical depth without an edge in surface density , or particles of different sizes may migrate radially at different rates in such a way as to give rise to a separation , but further study is needed to determine whether that is possible .",
    "another possibility is that the cassini division ramp was the site of an impact that seeded that region with larger particles that have not yet come to collisional equilibrium , but this too requires further study to evaluate its plausibility .",
    "further study is also needed to determine whether the varying particle - size distributions suggested in this paragraph can be reconciled with the `` excess variance '' patterns measured by stellar occultations @xcite and with the multi - wavelength diffraction data from _",
    "radio occultations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    finally , our findings raise the question of whether the cassini division ramp would more usefully be reckoned as the innermost part of the a  ring , rather than as the outermost part of the cassini division ( similarly , whether the c  ring ramp might have more in common with the inner - b  ring than with the rest of the c  ring ) .",
    "a possible compositional affinity was previously mentioned in section  [ context ] .",
    "the densest part of the a  ring is the apparently `` chaotic region '' from 122,350  km to @xmath0125,000  km , which is likely characterized by viscous overstability .",
    "the inner edge of that region is a precipitous drop in both optical depth and surface density at the location of the pandora  5:4 resonance ( 122,313  km ) , but the boundaries are not sharp.[multiblock footnote omitted ] further inward ( see figs .",
    "[ contextfig2 ] and  [ iawave_sigmamodel ] ) is a 250-km `` doorstep '' region of intermediate optical depth , whose inner boundary at the canonical inner edge of the a  ring ( 122,050  km ) is now revealed as a sharp edge in optical depth but not in surface density ( thus , as a sharp edge in mass extinction coefficient @xmath53 , most easily explained by means of particle properties ) .",
    "the surface density decreases steadily inward from the pandora resonance to the inner reaches of the ramp .",
    "perhaps the real inner edge of the a  ring complex should be reckoned at 120,900  km , where the cassini division s `` triple band '' feature gives way to the first risings of the ramp .",
    "however , no change in nomenclature will solve the primary question raised by this work : what is the nature of the changes in ring properties at 122,050  km , the canonical inner edge of the a  ring , and why do they occur ?",

    "<S> the iapetus  -1:0 nodal bending wave , the first spiral wave ever described in saturn s rings , has been seen again for the first time in 29 years . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that it is in fact the nodal bending wave , not the 1:0 apsidal density wave as previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> we use wavelet analysis to determine the wavelength profile , thus deriving the surface density at every point in the region covered by the bending wave . </S>",
    "<S> this profile is consistent with surface densities measured from more localized spiral density waves in the outer cassini division and the inner and mid - a ring , varying smoothly from the low values of the former to the higher values of the latter .    </S>",
    "<S> most remarkably , our analysis indicates that there is no significant change in surface density across the boundary between the outer cassini division and the inner - a  ring , despite the very abrupt increase in optical depth and reflected brightness at this location . </S>",
    "<S> we consider anew the nature of the classically identified `` inner edge of the a  ring , '' given that it does not appear to be correlated with any abrupt increase in surface density . </S>",
    "<S> there is an abrupt increase in surface density at the pandora  5:4 density wave , @xmath0300  km outward of the a  ring s inner edge . </S>",
    "<S> further study is needed to robustly interpret our findings in terms of particle properties and abundances , much less to explain the origins of the implied structure .    </S>",
