    "mesons are composed of quarks , interacting with each other through the exchange of gluons . under the low temperature and density conditions ,",
    "quarks are confined in hadrons and therefore are not observed as free particles , which makes their investigation challenging .",
    "the phenomenon of confinement is closely related to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "while the chiral symmetry broken in vacuum is expected to be restored at high temperature and density , it is also expected that the properties of mesons are affected by this chiral phase transition .",
    "thus the investigation of meson properties at finite temperature and density is an important part of hadron physics .",
    "such investigation unfortunately can not be pursued directly in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the ultimate theory of strong interaction , due to its large coupling constant at low energy scale and thereby the necessity of dealing non - perturbatively with its notoriously complicated structure .",
    "the investigations are usually performed by using the effective models which share the same symmetry properties with qcd such as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , the linear sigma model  @xcite , or by using the discretized version of qcd , i.e. , the lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "we employ , in this paper , the njl model to study the nonet meson properties ( for reviews on the model , see e.g. ,  vogl:1991qt , klevansky:1992qe , hatsuda:1994pi , buballa:2005rept ) .",
    "it is not renormalizable therefore one has to introduce the regularization procedure to handle the divergences appearing in loop integrals .",
    "there are several regularization schemes : the three- and four - momentum cutoff regularization , the dimensional regularization , the pauli - villars methods , and so on .",
    "we shall use the dimensional regularization ( dr ) in this paper . in the dr method",
    "the divergent fermion loop integrals which are the functions of the space - time dimensions are regularized by applying an analytic continuation in the dimensions variable .",
    "many works are devoted to the studies based on it ( see e.g. ,  krewald:1991tz , inagaki:1994ec , jafarov:2004jw , inagaki:2007dq , fujihara:2008ae ) .",
    "we believe that a regularization procedure is an important _ dynamical _ part of the njl model , it gives interaction between quarks the size and shapes it , which otherwise is point - like in the traditionally used leading order approximation of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "that is why it is important to chose a proper regularization . dimensional and",
    "cutoff regularizations can be considered as corresponding to the same size but different shape of the interaction .",
    "the fact that some physical results depend on the regularization way implies that the corresponding physics is sensitive ( probes ) not only to the size of the interaction but to its shape as well .",
    "if so the regularization dependent properties would be determined by higher energy ( shorter distances ) than those which do not depend on the regularization way .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the nonet meson properties such as masses and decay constants in the three - flavor njl model with the dr at finite temperature @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath2 . to this end",
    "one has to firstly determine the model parameters so that the model describes the physical ingredients properly .",
    "this has been done in the paper  @xcite , where the present authors have found that the various parameter sets reproduce the meson properties nicely at @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as our goal is to study meson properties at finite @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the paper is the straight forward extension of the previous work  @xcite .",
