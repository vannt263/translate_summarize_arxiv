    "frenkel excitons ( fes ) and their vibronics have been studied for several decades .",
    "@xcite the theoretical basis of the vibronic studies and their connection with spectroscopic data have been established in papers , @xcite as well as in a couple of reviews and books .",
    "@xcite the studies of charge transfer systems enlarge the applicability of the exciton theory towards the concept of charge transfer excitons ( ctes ) and their vibronics .",
    "@xcite the coupling between fe , ctes , and phonons complicates the vibronic spectra manifesting themselves in various linear and nonlinear phenomena .",
    "several mechanisms of this coupling combined with the intermolecular transfer of quasiparticles create bound ( one - particle ) exciton  phonon states and unbound many - particle ( mp ) states with rather different lineshapes .",
    "the models of vibronic spectra need productive methods of calculations and interpretation of the spectral pictures .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the vibronic spectra of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice with one molecule per unit cell .",
    "two types of symmetry of the molecules positions inside such a plane lattice are the subject of our study , notably    \\(a ) monoclinic or triclinic symmetry .",
    "this model mimics the ( @xmath0)-plane of polyacenes .",
    "we use some crystallographic and spectroscopic data for the crystals of anthracene , tetracene , and naphthalene in our 2d models .",
    "the polyacene crystals exhibit layered structure which is better pronounced in the crystals of increasing number of the benzene rings .",
    "our hypothesis of simple lattice neglects the effect of davydov splitting ( that effect has been treated , e.g. , in the paper by warns _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and in lalov _ _ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "the model of simple lattice allows us to obtain analytical and relatively simple results .",
    "\\(b ) hexagonal symmetry .",
    "the 2d sheets of hexagonal symmetry are actual nowadays not only because of their connection to the study of graphene but also in the crystal engineering of layered hexagonal structures ( see , e.g. , thalladi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we follow the vibronic approach developed and successfully applied in our previous papers , @xcite in which one - dimensional models have been considered .",
    "our present 2d study seems to be more realistic , especially for the case of polyacenes .",
    "the 2d models , however , limit the opportunity to treat the mixing of fe and ctes . whereas in 1d models",
    "this mixing can be described using three exciton branches ( one of fe plus two of ctes ) , the 2d models must include more than one decade of branches ( see petelenz _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite where the number of mixed exciton branches is 14 ) .",
    "the intention to simulate the details of the vibronic spectra and to interpret their structure is the reason to limit ourselves with the model of vibronic spectra of fe only in the simple lattice with one molecule per unit cell .",
    "moreover , according to nowadays concept the lowest singlet exciton in polyacenes is the frenkel exciton and this is an argument for the treatment of fes and their vibronics without mixing with ctes .    in calculating the linear optical susceptibility , @xmath1",
    ", we use the formalism of the green functions at @xmath2 and the nearest neighbor approximation . in this way",
    ", we express @xmath1 and calculate the linear absorption in terms of the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind @xmath3 the outline of the paper is the following : in the second section we introduce the hamiltonian and calculate the linear optical susceptibility in the range of one- and two - phonon vibronic spectra of a simple 2d lattice . in sec .  3",
    "those general expressions are specified for monoclinic and triclinic 2d lattices and using crystallographic and spectroscopic data for polyacenes we make simulations of their excitonic and vibronic spectra .",
    "our calculations concern the vibronics of anthracene , tetracene , and naphthalene with intramolecular vibration at frequency of @xmath4 @xmath5 , but for the last crystal we simulate also the well studied vibronics with vibrations at frequency of @xmath6 @xmath5 .",
    "section 4 deals with the vibronics in a hexagonal 2d lattice with one molecule per unit cell",
    ". two types of fes are the subject of our studies of the excitonic density of states ( dos ) and of linear absorption , namely ( i ) non - degenerate fes whose transition dipole moment is perpendicular to the plane of the lattice , and ( ii ) degenerate fes whose transition dipole moments are parallel to the layer .",
    "section 5 summarizes our findings and contains some conclusions . in the appendix ,",
    "the hamiltonian of degenerate fes in the case of a hexagonal lattice is established to split into two fully identical hamiltonians of left and right fes .",
    "we consider the excitonic and vibronic excitations in a 2d lattice ( @xmath0 ) with one molecule per unit cell . in the nearest neighbor approximation",
    "the fe part of the hamiltonian reads @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the operator of annihilation ( creation ) of the electronic excitation on the molecule @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the excitation energy of a molecule in the layers , and @xmath11 is the transfer integral of fe between molecules @xmath9 and @xmath12 . one mode of the intramolecular vibration at frequency @xmath13 is supposed to be coupled with the fe and @xmath14 is the annihilation operator of one vibrational quantum on the molecule @xmath9 .",
    "then the phonon part of the hamiltonian can be written down as @xmath15 we suppose both linear and quadratic fe  phonon coupling @xcite with a hamiltonian in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the linear fe  phonon coupling and @xmath18 is the change of the vibrational frequency of a molecule with electronic excitation on it ( quadratic coupling ) .",
    "the three parts ( [ eq : fe - h ] ) , ( [ eq : phonon - h ] ) , and ( [ eq : mix - h ] ) of the hamiltonian can be transformed with the goal of eliminating the linear coupling by using the canonical transformation @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 in the transformed hamiltonian the linear coupling terms are absent but the operators @xmath21 are replaced by @xmath22 ( for more details see lalov and zhelyazkov @xcite ) . in the momentum space @xmath23",

    ". the green functions ( [ eq : phi_ij ] ) have been calculated as an average over only the ground state @xmath30 taking into account the large values of @xmath10 and that @xmath31 .",
    "in the expression of the operator @xmath29 we preserve the transition moment of the fe only that reads @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the transition dipole moment of the electronic excitation on the molecule @xmath9 .",
    "the calculations of @xmath1 are reduced to calculating the following green functions : @xmath34 in calculating their fourier transforms in momentum space , @xmath35 , we obtain the following equation : @xmath36 g^{(0)}(0,0 ) = 1 +      \\hbar \\omega_a s^{(1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the sum on the whole 2d brillouin zone @xmath23 of the fourier transforms of following green functions : @xmath39 in calculating the green functions ( [ eq : gnm1 ] ) we obtain functions @xmath40 with two phonon operators @xmath41 and correspondingly one ladder with more complicated green functions appears .",
    "namely calculating them we use the vibronic approach @xcite in which the transfer terms @xmath25 are taken in one step of the ladder only .",
    "if we are interested in one - phonon vibronic spectra , the following equation of the component @xmath42 is valid    @xmath43 -      e_{\\rm f } - w\\left ( k_a , k_b \\right ) \\right \\ } g^{(1)}\\left ( k_a , k_b \\right )      = \\hbar \\omega_a g^{(0)}(0,0 ) + \\alpha s^{(1)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath44,\\ ] ] and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the following continuous fractions : @xmath47 @xmath48 after some algebra we find the following expression of the fourier transform @xmath35 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 - e_{\\rm f } - w\\left ( k_a , k_b \\right ) \\right \\}^{-1}.\\ ] ] finally we find the following expression of the linear optical susceptibility : @xmath51 in which @xmath52 depends upon the units , @xmath53 is the volume occupied by one molecule , and the @xmath54-axis is directed along the direction of the transition dipole moment @xmath33 . in the region of the two - phonon vibronic spectra",

    "in this case , the molecules create a plane rhombohedral or rectangular network with two nearest neighbors at @xmath59-direction and other two nearest neighbors at @xmath60-direction .",

    "we note here that the quantity @xmath64 expresses the excitonic density of states ( dos ) at @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "then we need the fourier transform @xmath81 of the retarding green function ( [ eq : gn0 ] ) which enters the expression of dos , @xmath82 , in the excitonic band : @xmath83 finally , it is easy to obtain the following relationship : @xmath84      naphthalene and anthracene crystals are of monoclinic symmetry and their crystallographic axes @xmath59 and @xmath60 are orthogonal as are @xmath68 and @xmath69 of their reciprocal lattices .",
    "tetracene crystals are triclinic and the angle @xmath85 between the @xmath59 and @xmath60 axes is approximately equal to @xmath86 but the @xmath68 and @xmath69 axes in the reciprocal lattice are almost perfectly orthogonal .    in the spectra of the three crystals we are largely interested in the intensive and widely studied electronic transition",

    "in the present paper , we investigate the excitonic and vibronic spectra of fes manifesting themselves in 2d plane lattices with one molecule per unit cell of the following types : ( i ) monoclinic or triclinic lattice which mimics the @xmath95 plane of polyacenes , and ( ii ) simple hexagonal lattice .",
    "we study the exciton dispersion and the excitonic dos in the nearest neighbor approximation as well as calculate the linear optical susceptibility and the linear absorption spectra in the range of a fe and its vibronics with one and two quanta of intramolecular vibration coupled with the fe by linear and quadratic couplings .",
    "the model of a lattice with one molecule per unit cell yields relatively simple expressions with complete elliptic integrals of the first kind .",
    "our approach allows us to find the positions of the mp ( unbound ) fe  phonon bands and of the one - particle ( bound ) states outside those bands .",

    "the simulations of the vibronic spectra exhibit a opposite impact of the linear fe  phonon coupling on the positions of the vibronic maxima : in case ( i ) of non - degenerate fes it repulses those maxima to the upper boundary of the mp bands or above these bands . in case ( ii ) of degenerate fes the linear coupling decreases the energy of the vibronic maxima .",
    "since the quadratic coupling in the usual case of @xmath97 decreases this energy , the simultaneous action of both coupling mechanisms can have a cumulative effect in case ( ii ) or a compensating one in case ( i ) .",

    "the intriguing models of layered polyacenes and of graphene , both with two molecules per unit cell can not be described using the relatively simple expressions of the present paper ",
    "one needs the usage of elliptic integrals of the third kind for an adequate modeling .",
    "nevertheless , many conclusions for the absorption inside and outside the mp bands are still valid .",
    "the studies of the excitonic dispersion and the structure of the vibronic spectra can be useful in the modeling of the excitonic transfer and the exciton  phonon coupling manifesting themselves in other linear and nonlinear phenomena .",
    "the dipole - active fes whose transition dipole moments are parallel to the hexagonal layer are two - fold degenerate . the same two - fold degenerate electronic excitations must exist in each molecule of the monolayer . in the lack of rotational symmetry of molecules in the ( @xmath98)-plane of the monolayer it is impossible to ensure optical isotropy inside that plane .",
