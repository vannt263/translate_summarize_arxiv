    "quantum computation provides a substantial speedup for several important computational tasks @xcite . a general quantum bit ( qubit ) consists of a two level quantum system with a controllable hamiltonian of sufficient generality to implement a universal set of quantum logic gates @xcite .",
    "from such a set , an arbitrary quantum algorithm can be implemented to any desired accuracy limited only by decoherence .",
    "a universal two qubit system requires just single - qubit rotations and one additional entangling two qubit gate .",
    "one important example is the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate which switches the state of the second qubit depending on the state of the first qubit and is given in spinor representation of @xmath0 by @xmath1 up to a global phase .",
    "superconducting josephson charge and persistent current ( flux ) qubits have been shown to possess the necessary properties @xcite to act as a quantum bit .",
    "they have been manipulated coherently and coherence times in the @xmath2 range have been demonstrated @xcite with a corresponding quality factor of quantum coherence of up to @xmath3 @xcite . in a two qubit system , where the coupling was achieved using a shared josephson junction ,",
    "coherent rabi oscillations between states of a coupled qubit system were observed @xcite and in a two charge qubit system a conditional gate operation was performed @xcite .",
    "all of these experiments suffer from material imperfections which lead to non - ideal time evolutions of the quantum states due to a parameter spread in the characteristic energies of the system hamiltonian . on the other hand , for high symmetry of the qubit parameters",
    ", the qubit coherence can be strongly protected .",
    "this extends from the protection of the singlet in a symmetric qubit setup @xcite to the general concept of decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs ) @xcite .",
    "general considerations on the stability of such dfs can be found in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , the dependence of the decoherence rates and gate quality factors on the parameter spread of the qubits will be elaborated theoretically . in perspective , this is of crucial importance for connecting the experimental status and prospects to these central concepts in quantum information science : which degree of parameter uniformity do experiments have to achieve for symmetry - based protection schemes to work  do these schemes have to be extended in order to accomodate experimental restrictions ?    moreover , variable bath couplings to the decohering environment have also been identified , _",
    "e.g. _ , in ref.@xcite . the decoherence properties of different qubit operators that are coupled to the environmental bath will be investigated in this work .",
    "the hamiltonian of a typical pseudo - spin system can be expressed in terms of the pauli matricies as @xmath4 in a two qubit system , an additional interaction term is required to implement the universal two qubit gate . in superconducting implementations",
    "@xcite this coupling term is typically proportional to @xmath5 . here",
    ", the superscripts are the qubit indices .",
    "in particular , inductively coupled flux qubits @xcite and capacitively coupled charge qubits @xcite are coupled this way .",
    "thus , the two qubit hamiltonian is @xmath6 in the singlet / triplet basis , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 that exhibits the symmetry properties of the coupling most clearly , this hamiltonian takes the following explicit matrix form @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 . using this hamiltonian",
    "the cnot gate can be implemented through a sequence of elementary quantum gates @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the hadamard gate operation performed on the second qubit .",
    "it involves one two - qubit operation at step three only . for our numerical calculations we applied the characteristic energies that were used in @xcite as a viable example for superconducting solid - state flux or charge qubits . following this approach also gate sequences optimized with respect to decoherence",
    "have been studied @xcite .    disregarding the hadamard gates , the gate operation eqn .",
    "( [ cnotgateseq ] ) forms a controlled - phase ( cphase ) gate @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "+ in experimental realizations of this model , additional effects always impair the capability of the system to operate as a qubit . in condensed matter implementations , the most pronounced is the coupling to environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads to relaxation , _",
    "i.e. _ , classical thermalization of the states as well as , on a much shorter timescale , to dephasing .",
    "decoherence causes the system to act like a classical ensemble eliminating all potential computational benefits of quantum algorithms . for a wide range ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) of solid state implementations",
    "the dominant decoherence effects caused by coupling to linear environments such as electric circuits obey gaussian statistics and can be effectively modeled with a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "it is assumed here that there is only one decoherence source in the dominating order of magnitude in the coupling parameter and possible weaker noise sources are ignored . to model this source each qubit",
    "is either coupled to an individual or to a common bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the system hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath20 or @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spin - representation of the qubit operator talking to the environment that depends on the specific implementation of the qubit .",
    "for the special case of superconducting flux qubits which only experience flux noise and superconducting charge qubits which are only subject to charge noise this would correspond to @xmath23 .",
    "here , @xmath24 is the collective coordinate of the harmonic oscillator bath and the superscript distinguishes between the single bath and the two bath case .",
    "the general form is @xmath25 where the factor @xmath26 in front of @xmath27 and @xmath28 was chosen for convenience in the singlet / triplet basis in which the qubit - bath interaction becomes @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath32 for the case of two baths and @xmath33 for one common bath .    in the following we will ,",
    "without loss of generality , characterize the results by the angle @xmath34 between the @xmath35 and @xmath36 component of the coupling @xmath37 this is completely analogous to the bath coupling that is encountered in proposed experimental qubit realizations , _",

    "following the lines of @xcite and @xcite the bloch - redfield formalism is applied to calculate the effects of decoherence .",
    "the bloch - redfield equations and decoherence rates are given analytically .",
    "however , in comparsion to a fully analytic evaluation of the dynamics of the two qubit system @xcite , with this method the time evolution of the reduced density matrix can also be determined numerically for a wide range of system hamiltonians .",
    "the environment , _",
    "i.e. _ , the bath of harmonic oscillators , is characterized by its spectral density .",
    "the strength of the dissipative effects is given by the dimensionless parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the bath spectral function is assumed to be linear in frequency up to a cutoff frequency @xmath40 .",
    "thus , @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _ , we employ an ohmic spectrum with a drude cutoff .",
    "the cutoff frequency is chosen two orders of magnitude above the largest frequency which is typical for a flux qubit system , @xmath42 hz @xcite .",
    "we choose a rather large coupling strength to the environment of @xmath43 , which is still in the weak coupling regime , to be able to observe pronounced decoherence effects .",

    "all calculations were performed in the same parameter regime as in ref .",
    "@xcite , thus renormalization effects of the frequencies are weak and will be neglected .",
    "the ability of a realistic circuit , or in our case a more realistic model of a circuit , to operate as a quantum gate is characterized by the four gate quality factors introduced in @xcite .",
    "those are the fidelity @xmath66 , purity @xmath67 , quantum degree @xmath68 and entanglement capability @xmath69 .",
    "the quantum degree and entanglement capability characterize entangling operations .",
    "they are unique to multi - qubit gates",
    ". we will collectively refer to these as non - local gate quality factors ( gqfs ) as opposed to fidelity and purity , which are both well defined for an arbitrary number of qubits , in particular also for a single qubit , and will be referred to as the local gate quality factors .",
    "the fidelity can be evaluated @xcite as follows @xmath70 the overline indicates the average over a discrete set of unentangled input states @xmath71 that can serve as a basis for all possible input density matrices .",
    "the propagator @xmath72 is the ideal unitary evolution of the desired gate , and @xmath73 is the density matrix after applying the realistic gate to @xmath74 .",
    "thus a perfect gate reaches a fidelity of unity and the deviation from unity indicates the deviation from the ideal process .",
    "the purity @xmath67 is indicative of the decoherence effects , @xmath75 again , the overline indicates the input state average .",
    "a pure output state leads to @xmath67 equal to one , whereas as the state becomes increasingly mixed , the square of the weight of the contributions no longer sums up to unity and goes down to a minimum of one divided by the dimension of the hilbert space of the system , 1/4 in our case . +",
    "whereas the preceding two factors can be defined for any number of qubits , the following two are particular to the higher dimensional case @xmath76 here the @xmath77 are the density operators after the gate operation relating to unentangled input states , whereas the @xmath78 are the maximally entangled states , also known as bell states .",
    "therefore , this measures the ability of the gate to create quantum entanglement .",
    "+ finally , @xmath69 is the smallest eigenvalue of the density matrix resulting from transposing the density matrix of one qubit .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the non - negativity of this smallest eigenvalue is a necessary condition for the separability of the density matrix into two unentangled systems .",
    "after separation , the partially transposed density matrix is a valid density matrix as well , with non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "the negativity of the smallest eigenvalue thus indicates that the states are not separable and thus non - local .",
    "it approaches -0.5 for the ideal cnot gate , the dynamics of entanglement in a two - qubit system have been studied in ref .",
    "the entanglement capability is closely related to the _ negativity _ @xmath79 of a state @xcite which is a non - entropic entanglement monotone @xcite .",

    "we start with the cphase gate which is entangling and forms the core part of the cnot operation .",
    "the quantum degree for the cphase gate is always smaller than the ideal value because the cphase gate can not create entangled bell states .",
    "thus , we did not consider the quantum degree for the cphase gate .",
    "the different error coupling configurations achieve the best gate quality factors for different coupling operators to the environmental baths .",
    "the scenarios are summarized in table 1 .",
    "two qualitatively different temperature regions are found , separated by a smooth crossover . for low temperatures @xmath80 , where @xmath82 ghz is the characteristic energy scale , which corresponds to the typical qubit energy scale during the quantum gate operation , spontaneous emission processes dominate .",
    "when @xmath83 is approached , thermal effects become important and for @xmath84 temperature is the dominating energy scale as will be discussed in more detail below .    the cphase gate , for pure @xmath36 coupling , is protected by symmetry because the gate operation and the coupling to the bath commute . as was shown previously ,",
    "all disturbances vanish here in the limit of low temperatures . in this case ,",
    "spontaneous emission processes are the dominating decoherence mechanism because absorption and excitation processes are effectively suppressed due to the bath coupling ( _ i.e. _ matrix elements for theses processes are restricted due to symmetries of the bath coupling operators ) and the temperature . in this case",
    ", the low temperature regime can be referred to as the emission limited regime .    the additional @xmath35 operation in the cnot gate eqn.([cnotgateseq ] ) during the single qubit hadamard operations",
    "leads to nonvanishing decoherence rates even in the low temperature limit .",
    "the reason is again the competition of pure dephasing with emission and absorption processes which show a different dependence on the coupling angle @xmath34 .",
    "however , the hadamard part of the cnot operation is short compared to the overall length of the gate operation ( [ cnotgateseq ] ) .",
    "thus , it is found that for low temperatures the best values for the gqfs are obtained very close to pure @xmath36 coupling as depicted in fig.[gateslowt ] .",
    "this implies that the overall decoherence effects are smallest if the bath coupling angle @xmath34 throughout the gate is adjusted to the distribution of gate operations , which are characterized by different directions on the bloch sphere .    for the cnot gate better results",
    "are observed for the single bath case throughout the low temperature regime , see fig.[gateslowt ] . for the single bath configuration , close to pure @xmath35 coupling to the bath",
    "the difference becomes quite significant and for the non local gqfs actually approaches a factor of two , but reduces again as pure @xmath35 coupling is reached .",
    "the cphase gate ( cf.fig.[gateslowt ] ) prefers a two bath configuration unless the coupling is @xmath35 dominated .",
    "again the non - local gqfs are affected most .    for the pure @xmath36 case ( @xmath85 or correspondingly @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) little difference between the two bath and the single bath behavior",
    "is found in the cnot case and none at all for the cphase .",
    "it is observed that the single bath configuration is certainly preferred as soon as there is a significant @xmath35 contribution in the gate operation .",
    "this means that the additional protection from the one dimensional decoherence free subspace @xcite involved is mainly beneficial if the commutator of the qubit operator , which couples to the bath and the qubit hamiltonian ( the hamiltonian that is needed to perform the individual parts of the gate operation ) has appropriate matrix elements , _",
    "i.e. _ , if there is a significant non - commuting part in the bath coupling and the gate operations . however , in a @xmath36 dominated case the individual coupling is preferred as it does not induce any additional indirect couplings between the qubits .",
    "it is natural that the two qubit gqfs should notice this more strongly than the single qubit gqfs for which the differences never become more than about one fifth of the individual deviations .",
    "+ for the high temperature regime , drastically different behavior in the non - local gqfs is found , see fig .",
    "[ cnot ] . both of them now achieve their best values at a pure @xmath35 coupling for both gates , the local gqfs achieve their maximum at a pure @xmath36 value .",
    "the protection that the cphase gate enjoyed in the low temperature regime breaks down here .",
    "the high temperature case is essentially scale free , _",
    "i.e. _ , high temperatures symmetrize the system . in this case",
    "the system eigenbasis is given by the qubit operator which couples to the bath .",
    "this can be nicely shown when considering the single qubit dephasing rates within the spin - boson model @xcite , @xmath88 this becomes @xmath89 for @xmath90 and does not depend on the ratio @xmath91 .",
    "thermalization is determined by the off - diagonal bath couplings in the basis of the corresponding system hamiltonian which is required for a certain gate operation .",
    "it will be strongly dominated by the non - commuting contributions , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath35 bath coupling for the cphase part of the cnot gate .",
    "the single - qubit hadamard part of the cnot gate will be additionally also affected by the @xmath36 bath coupling . the two - qubit operation ( cphase ) , or in other words the non - local part , of the cnot gate is of the @xmath92-type and the single - qubit hadamard gates contain both @xmath35 and @xmath36 contributions .",
    "thus , during the gate operation the thermalization is dominated strongly by the @xmath35 part of the bath coupling for the non - local and by the @xmath36 part for the local gqfs , implying that for thermal fluctuations the @xmath35-type couplings are more important in inducing inter - qubit transitions , while @xmath36 primarily affects the single qubit gate quantifiers .",
    "what implementation to choose for a gate here , becomes a question of what gate quantifiers are desired to be optimized .",
    "the differences between the one bath and two bath scenario are now small .    for pure @xmath36 coupling of the qubit to the bath , a peculiar effect is observed . in this case , the minimal eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix that is the entanglement capability stays negative even for @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ cnot ] ) .",
    "the negativity of the eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix is not just a necessary but also a sufficient criterium for the nonseparability of the system in our case @xcite .",
    "thus , no matter what the temperature or strength of the dissipative effects in our system during the cnot gate operation , entanglement will never be eliminated completely .",
    "this can be explained by fast thermalization into a protected entangled state .",
    "furthermore , this effect carries over well into the regime where both @xmath35 and @xmath36 noise are present .",
    "overall , the temperature ( and the coupling strength ) has the largest influence on the gqfs . at @xmath94 ( @xmath95 k )",
    ", we observe deviations of the gqfs from the ideal value which are less than @xmath96 . at @xmath93 ( @xmath97",
    "k ) the deviations are @xmath98 and quickly increasing further at larger temperatures .",
    "the different coupling operators to the bath are the next strongest effect .",
    "rotating the coupling operator from @xmath36 to @xmath35 causes , in the worst cases , three to four times stronger deviations from the ideal value than the @xmath36 noise . finally , the change due to different types of bath couplings is generally small compared to the differences between @xmath35 and @xmath36 type coupling .",
    "this also suggests that we do not need to worry about noise sources with a weaker coupling strength , even if they couple through a less favorable coupling operator .    as an intermediate conclusion",
    ", it is found that for the decoherence dominated regime the cphase operation reached the optimum value of the gqfs for a pure @xmath36-coupling to the bath . in the case of the cnot operation ,",
    "the minimum is located slightly shifted to the @xmath35 component because of the mixture of @xmath35 parts during the hadamard operations , compare with fig.[gateslowt ] .    for the cnot operation ,",
    "the optimum values of the four gate quantifiers are encountered at different bath couplings , which are characterized by the mixing angle eqn .",
    "( [ errcoupling ] ) , especially for large temperatures .",
    "thus , the differences between the case of one common bath and two baths are much less important than the symmetries between the gate operation and the bath operators .",
    "in particular , the difference between the case of one or two baths disappears for pure @xmath36 coupling to the bath . here",

    "@xmath102 and thus also the asymmetry @xmath115 is varied .",
    "experimentally the spread of the qubit parameters due to fabricational imprecision is very important both because quantum algorithms ( without further modification ) require a certain level of precision and the decoherence effects in the system of qubits have to be sufficiently small @xcite .",

    "we observe that for pure @xmath35 coupling to the bath ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) , the asymmetry of the qubits is irrelevant because the coupling to the bath and the system hamiltonian commute ( the indices of qubit one and qubit two could be exchanged without changing the system ) .",
    "for mixed bath coupling of the @xmath35 type for one qubit ( @xmath117 ) and the @xmath36 ( @xmath106 ) type for the other qubit , still the decoherence rates do not vary for different asymmetry .",

    "_ e.g. _ , in the case of @xmath127 already for a deviation between @xmath110 and @xmath102 of less than approximately 10% .",
    "moreover , there is a large spread among the dephasing rates , which are sensitive to the qubit asymmetries .",
    "note that both the single bath and the two bath case behave identically for the relaxation rate .",

    "i.e. _ , only flipless dephasing processes contribute to the overall decoherence .",
    "note that in the case where the system hamiltonian and the coupling to the bath commute ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) the relaxation rate vanishes .",
    "it is found that the dephasing rates depend strongly on the qubit asymmetry .",
    "nevertheless the parameter spread of the qubit energies can be quite large ( around 10% ) without affecting the decoherence properties considerably .",
    "however , for very large asymmetries and a bath coupling , which is perpendicular to the system hamiltonian , the decoherence rates increase exponentially with asymmetry .",
    "a system of two pseudospins coupled by an ising type zz - interaction , which models _",
    "e.g. _ superconducting charge or flux qubits , was investigated .",
    "it was shown that the for the system of two pseudospins the optimum gate performance of different gate operations is closely related to their composition of elementary gates and the coupling to the bath . when considering the gate quality factors , the temperature and special symmetries of the system - bath coupling have the largest influence on the decoherence properties , whereas the single or two bath scenarios make only little difference .",
    "for the cphase operation at low temperatures , the optimum gate quality factors are at pure @xmath36 system - bath coupling due to the fact that only in this case all individual hamiltonians necessary for performing the gate operations and the system bath coupling commute .",
    "similarily , the cnot gate operation approaches the best gate quality factors close to @xmath36 system - bath coupling with a slight @xmath35 admixture due to the hadamard operations .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the parameter spread of the tunnel matrix elements of the qubits , when operated close to the degeneracy point can be quite large ( approximately 10% ) for a bath coupling which commutes with the system hamiltonian without affecting the decoherence properties considerably . in this case",
    "the differences in the decoherence rates stay below 1% .",
