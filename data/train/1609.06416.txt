    "the successful isolation of graphene in 2004@xcite led us into the brand new world of two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials.@xcite as the lecture title given by richard p.  feynman in 1959,@xcite `` there s plenty of room at the bottom '' .",
    "since graphene was born , unforeseen luxuriant physical and chemical properties of this atomically thin material have attracted rising attention at extremely fast rate in the past years.@xcite for example , the unique ballistic transport and extraordinarily high carrier mobility greatly expanded graphene s potential applications.@xcite however , everything has its drawback .",
    "the zero bandgap severely limits graphene s application in electronics.@xcite therefore , some efforts have been moved to explore the potentials of other 2d layered semiconductor materials.@xcite representative systems include graphynes,@xcite transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds),@xcite black phosphorus ( bp)@xcite and transition metal carbides and nitrides ( mxenes)@xcite .",
    "they retain the one - atom - thin nature of graphene , and provide applicable bandgaps , making them hopeful to be used in flexible electronics , photodetectors , thin - film transistors and other devices.@xcite on the other hand , suitable bandgap is necessary but not sufficient for a well - performing electronic component .",
    "the carrier mobility is also crucial.@xcite    some 2d materials are isotropic,@xcite while others are anisotropic.@xcite for anisotropic 2d semiconductors , their electrons and phonons have different behaviors along different directions in the plane , leading to angle - dependent mechanical , optical and electrical response .",
    "these unique properties may create unprecedented possibilities to design novel sensors with anisotropic crystalline orientation , optical absorption and scattering , carrier mobility and electronic conductance.@xcite here , we focus on the theoretical study of the anisotropic carrier mobility .    despite of the importance of carrier mobility ,",
    "the theory of intrinsic mobility for anisotropic 2d semiconductors was not well developed .",
    "for example , a widely adopted formula in the literature was given as@xcite @xmath2 where the superscript ( tr)was used to indicate that the corresponding quantities are defined in the transport direction .",
    "@xmath3 is the carrier mobility .",
    "@xmath4 is the elementary charge , @xmath5 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath6 is the boltzmann s constant , and @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "@xmath8 is the effective mass of charge carriers ( electrons and holes ) along the transport direction ( either @xmath9 or @xmath10 along the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , respectively ) , and @xmath13 is the equivalent density - of - state mass defined as @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the 2d elastic modulus of the longitudinal strain in the propagation directions , and @xmath16 is the deformation potential constant defined as the energy shift of the band edge position with respect to the strain . @xmath15 and @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) come from the influence of acoustic phonons .",
    "( 1 ) implies that the mobility in a specified direction is determined only by @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the same direction but is independent on those in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this is , however , logically incorrect , because moving carriers would be inevitably scattered by phonons from all directions . in this study , based on the boltzmann equation",
    ", we will deduce an analytical formula of intrinsic mobility for anisotropic semiconductors , where the mobility in one direction is indeed determined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 along all directions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the contributions of anisotropic @xmath19 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 on @xmath3 were theoretically studied separately . in section iii ,",
    "the obtained formula was applied to numerically analyze the mobility anisotropy of some 2d materials , which showed that the anisotropy in most systems is weaker than what has been previously thought . in section iv , a historic perspective on the mobility of 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) was provided to demonstrate its relation to that of 2d materials .",
    "finally , we summarized our results and made some conclusions .",
    "the carrier mobility of a sample is determined by various scattering processes .",
    "a primary source of scatters for charge carriers is acoustic phonons , which can not be removed at finite temperature and thus determines the intrinsic mobility of the material .",
    "most mobility predictions on 2d semiconductors are based on the consideration of scattering by acoustic phonons .",
    "theoretically , the intrinsic mobility caused by acoustical phonons can be described by the deformation potential theory,@xcite where the atomic displacement associated with a long - wavelength acoustic phonon leads to a deformation of the crystal , and in turn , to a shift of the band edge and scattering between different eigen states .    in the spirit of the deformation potential theory ,",
    "the shift of the band edge ( @xmath20 ) is proportional to the longitudinal strain @xmath21 caused by longitudinal acoustic ( la ) vibrational modes ( phonons ) with a wave vector @xmath22 : @xmath23 where the deformation potential constant @xmath18 depends on the direction of longitudinal strain and phonons for anisotropic materials .",
    "the contribution of transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonons is ignored as in the usual deformation potential theory . under the fermi - golden rule and the second quantization of the phonons ,",
    "the scattering probability of an electron from eigen state @xmath24 to @xmath25 caused by la phonons can be written as@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the area of 2d sample and @xmath28 is the elastic modulus caused by @xmath29 .",
    "the momentum conservation law requires that @xmath30 . both the emission and the absorption of the phonons were considered in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , and the temperature is much higher than the characteristic degenerate [ bloch - grneisen ( bg ) ] temperature . the relaxation time for an electron in @xmath24 , denoted as @xmath31 , is thus given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the group velocity .",
    "the boltzmann equation is the basis for the classical and semi - classical theories of transport processes .",
    "it has been widely used in studying thermal , mass and electrical conductivities under weak driving forces .",
    "based on the boltzmann equation with the relaxation time approximation , the 2d conductivity tensor is solved to be@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the eigen energy of state @xmath24 , and @xmath36 is the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the mobility along the @xmath11 direction is thus @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the carrier density .",
    "( [ eq2]-[eq6 ] ) provide the general framework to calculate the intrinsic mobility of 2d materials under la phonons .",
    "the mobility anisotropy may arise from anisotropic @xmath35 ( which is related the anisotropic effective mass ) , @xmath39 or @xmath28 , which will be analyzed in details as follows .",
    "when only the effective mass is anisotropic , the energy dispersion is described as @xmath40 where the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions are chosen to be along the primary axes of the energy dispersion .",
    "making use of the coordinate transformation @xmath41 it is straight forward to derive from eqns .",
    "( [ eq2]-[eq6 ] ) to get the relaxation time @xmath42 and the mobility @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are isotropic .",
    "@xmath31 is independent on @xmath24 even if the effective mass is anisotropic in this case .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) is identical to eq .",
    "( 1 ) if both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are isotropic , i.e. , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is valid when only the effective mass is anisotropic .",
    "we now consider the case that only the deformation potential is anisotropic while both effective mass and elastic modulus keep isotropic .",
    "strain is second - order tensor , so a longitudinal strain with any specified direction can be decomposed into three components in 2d systems : two uniaxial strains ( along @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , respectively ) and a shear strain .",
    "if the system has mirror reflection symmetry , the contribution of the shear component to the deformation potential disappears , and then @xmath39 can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the polar angle of @xmath22 , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are deformation potential constants along @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , respectively . combined with eqns .",

    "( 4 ) gives @xmath50 , \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the polar angle of @xmath24 , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 are notations defined as @xmath54 @xmath31 is anisotropic here , being distinct from the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) under anisotropic effective mass .",
    "the mobility is obtained as @xmath55 with the notations @xmath56 eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) is a bit complicated .",
    "to see the anisotropic effect more clearly , we rewrite it into @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a corrected factor due to the anisotropic effect : @xmath59 the curve of @xmath58 is given in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath60 , it gives @xmath61 , consistent with the isotropic result . within the examined range",
    ", @xmath58 can be well reproduced by a quadratic function : @xmath62 as demonstrated as the solid line in fig .  1 .",
    "with the quadratic approximation , the mobility under anisotropic deformation potential is simplified into @xmath63 it can be seen that the mobility along the @xmath11 direction not only depends on the deformation potential along the same direction @xmath64 , but also depends on that along its perpendicular direction @xmath65 .      for the anisotropic effect of elastic modulus @xmath28 ,",
    "usually only the values along the primary axes ( taken as @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions ) were calculated in the literature . as an approximation",
    ", we express @xmath28 as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are 2d elastic constants along @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions , respectively .",
    "the effective mass and deformation potential are kept isotropic .",
    "the relaxation time is obtained as : @xmath69 , \\label{eq21}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 the mobility is given as @xmath71 where @xmath72 eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) can be expanded to the linear order of @xmath73 to give a simplified result : @xmath74 which shows that the mobility along the @xmath11 direction depends on both the elastic constants along @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions .",
    "in the section above , the anisotropic effects of the effective mass , the deformation potential and the elastic modulus on the mobility of 2d semiconductors were analyzed separately to give analytical results .",
    "when all these anisotropic factors appear together in a system , it is too complicated to achieve an analytical solution",
    ". therefore , we propose to express the mobility approximately by combining different anisotropic factors directly :    @xmath75    where @xmath27 and @xmath76 are functions of deformation potential whose definition was given in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 are functions of elastic modulus , whose definition was given in eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) . with the low order approximation ,",
    "a concise form is achieved as : @xmath79 anisotropic effective mass is the main contributor to the mobility anisotropy . to measure the mobility anisotropy , we define an anisotropic ratio @xmath80 as : @xmath81 which is equal to 1.0 for isotropic systems and is larger than 1.0 for anisotropic systems .",
    "the variation of @xmath82 with various parameters are demonstrated in fig .  2 . for anisotropic mass",
    "acting along with @xmath83 , it yields @xmath84 . in comparison , it is only @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the anisotropy contribution from elastic constant and deformation potential is much weaker than that from the energy dispersion ( effective mass ) .",
    "consistently , for materials with dirac cone and zero bandgap , the anisotropic contribution is also dominated by the energy dispersion ( fermi velocity ) while the contribution from deformation potential is nearly zero.@xcite      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ` e ' and ` h ' denote ` electron ' and ` hole ' , respectively . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are measured as the ratio with @xmath89 ( the electron mass in vacuum ) . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are in units of ev . @xmath67 and @xmath68 are in units of j / m@xmath90 . @xmath91 and @xmath92 are in units of 10@xmath93 cm@xmath90v@xmath95s@xmath95 .",

    "undoped bp is @xmath98-type semiconductor .",
    "related experiments on thin - layer bp suggested that the hole mobility were larger than electron one and the mobility along the @xmath11 ( armchair ) direction were greater than that along the @xmath12 direction.@xcite however , the calculation of single - layer bp by the old formula gave opposite results of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , as shown in table i. instead , under the same parameters , the new formula produces results with the trend consistent with the experiments .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy between the old and new formula comes from the fact that the old formula overestimates the contribution of the deformation potential to the mobility anisotropy .",
    "it predicted that the anisotropy ratio is proportional to @xmath101[see eq .",
    "since single - layer bp has @xmath48 (= 2.5 ev ) much larger than @xmath49 (= 0.15 ev ) for holes , it predicted @xmath102 .",
    "however , according to the new formula , the contribution of the deformation potential to the mobility anisotropy is actually weak , where the main contributor is the effective mass .",
    "@xmath9 of bp is smaller than @xmath10 , so @xmath103 under the new formula , which is consistent with the prediction by kubo - nakano - mori method based on electron - phonon scattering matrices@xcite and charged - impurity scattering theory.@xcite moreover , they are in agreement with the experimental observations.@xcite    tis@xmath1 monolayer is a new 2d material predicted to possess novel electronic properties.@xcite first - principles calculations showed that tis@xmath1 is a direct - gap semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.02 ev , close to that of bulk silicon.@xcite with the old method , tis@xmath1 was predicted to possess high mobility up to @xmath104 for electrons in the @xmath12 direction @xmath105 $ ] , and more remarkably , the mobility is highly anisotropic , i.e. , @xmath106 is about 14 times higher than @xmath107 and is even two orders of magnitude higher than @xmath108.@xcite with the new method , however , the obtained anisotropy is much smaller .",
    "the re - calculated @xmath106 is @xmath109 , close to the old value , but the re - calculated @xmath107 increases from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , giving an anisotropic ratio of only @xmath112 ( see table i ) .",
    "the recalculated electrons / holes mobility ratio is 15 instead of 100 , suggesting that the potential in electron / hole separation is not so remarkable as previously thought .",
    "the calculated anisotropy ratios from new and old methods are analyzed in fig .",
    "the discrepancy is large , indicating that the old method is highly unreliable .",
    "overall , the old method is more likely to predict high anisotropy .",
    "for example , among all 42 datapoints , only three were predicted by the new method to possess @xmath113 : holes of bp ( 14.6 ) , holes of bc@xmath0n ( 19.3 ) and holes of sc@xmath0c(oh)@xmath0 ( 11.7 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the old method predicted 15 datapoints to have @xmath113 , three of which possess @xmath114 : holes of bc@xmath0n ( 54.9 ) , and holes ( 75.3 ) and electrons ( 53.7 ) of gech@xmath1 .",
    "to understand the state of art of mobility calculation in anisotropic 2d semiconductors by the deformation potential theory , it is necessary to know the historical development . in this section",
    ", we make a brief survey on it , and recognize some improper ways in the literature in calculating mobility .",
    "the deformation potential theory was first proposed by bardeen and shockley in 1950 for three - dimension ( 3d ) non - polar semiconductors.@xcite with the development of metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistor ( mosfet ) in the next years , scientists found that the electrons move in the semiconductor - oxide interface of mosfet , being free in 2d but tightly confined in the third dimension , which could be described as a 2d sheet embedded in a 3d world .",
    "all the constructs with similar characteristics were known as 2d electron gas ( 2deg).@xcite in 1969 , kamaji extended the deformation potential theory to the phonon - limited carrier mobility of 2deg in a semiconductor inversion layer by an inverted triangular well potential model , and a simple formula was reported to calculate the lattice - scattering mobility of 2deg:@xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the 3d mass density of the crystal , @xmath117 is the velocity of longitudinal wave and @xmath118 can be replaced by 3d elastic constant @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath120 is the effective thickness of the inversion layer with a complex expression determined by dielectric constant of the material as well as the impurity and free electron densities.@xcite then in 1981 , price applied the theory in a semiconductor hetero - layer to calculate the lattice - scattering mobility,@xcite where he described the layer for active carriers in 2deg as square wells , and obtained a simple expression for @xmath120 : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the width of the square well.@xcite in anisotropic systems , effective mass @xmath19 and deformation potential constant @xmath18 are second - order tensors , while elastic modulus @xmath17 is a fourth - order tensor , components of these tensors are not independent.@xcite the mobility anisotropy of 2deg on oxidized silicon surfaces could be attributed to the difference in the effective mass and it was interpreted by sat _",
    "et al . _  in 1971 based on an ellipsoidal constant - energy surface.@xcite with the anisotropic mass , the mobility of 2deg in inversion layer was modified into@xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "2deg in inversion layer is not real 2d system in the sense that it is always embedded in 3d material .",
    "that is the reason why 3d parameter @xmath116 appeared in eqns .",
    "( [ eq29 ] , [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "graphene and other 2d crystals studied in recent years , on the other hand , are real 2d systems since they could exist independently . as an important property ,",
    "their mobility attracted a lot of interest.@xcite almost all of mobility calculations were based on the generation of eqns .",
    "( 29 , 31 ) of 2deg . to generate the formula to real 2d systems",
    ", some ones assumed @xmath125 to give@xcite @xmath126 while some others assumed @xmath127 to give@xcite @xmath128 the generations were somehow arbitrary without necessary theoretical deduction .",
    "for example , the factor 2/3 comes from 2deg being confined in square well , but the behaviors of electrons in real 2d systems have nothing to do with square well . by comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) we deduced above , it is recognized that eq .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) is valid when both deformation potential and elastic modulus are isotropic , while eq .",
    "( [ eq33 ] ) is always improper .",
    "another improper generation in the literature lay in the anisotropic effects .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) was originally used to investigate the mobility of isotropic system such as 2d hexagonal bn,@xcite but it was later adopted to study anisotropic systems such as bp.@xcite as we have revealed in the above sections , eq .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) is actually not applicable under anisotropic deformation potential and elastic modulus .",
    "in summary , we have theoretically studied the la - phonon - limited mobility for anisotropic 2d semiconductors under the framework of the deformation potential theory .",
    "the influences of anisotropic deformation potential constant and elastic modulus were analytically derived .",
    "it was shown that the mobility in one direction depends not only on the parameters ( effective mass , deformation potential constant and elastic modulus ) along the same direction , but also depends on those along its perpendicular direction .",
    "the mobility anisotropy is mainly contributed by the anisotropic effective mass , while the distribution from the deformation potential constant and elastic modulus is much weaker .",
    "parameters for various anisotropic 2d materials were collected to calculate the mobility anisotropy .",
    "it was demonstrated that the old formulas widely adopted in the literature were unreliable , and they were more likely to overestimate the anisotropic ratio .",
