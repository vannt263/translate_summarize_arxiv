    "in the relativistic ( or dirac- ) brueckner model the dynamical two - nucleon correlations in infinite nuclear matter are studied .",
    "the formalism is based on an effective quantum field theory for mesons and nucleons @xcite and thus ignores the underlying quark nature of the nucleon . in the brueckner model the t - matrix ( or brueckner g - matrix ) serves as an effective in - medium two - body interaction .",
    "it is determined by a self - consistent summation of the ladder diagrams in a quasipotential approximation ( thompson equation ) to the bethe - salpeter equation , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the bare nucleon - nucleon ( ladder ) interaction is described by one - boson exchange potentials . in the present work",
    "we apply the bonn potentials a , b , c of refs .",
    "@xcite and for comparison also a simple @xmath0-potential which is well known from the walecka model @xcite .",
    "the nucleon inside the nuclear medium is treated as a dressed dirac particle where the influence of the coupling to the surrounding nucleons via the t - matrix serving as an effective interaction is expressed by the nucleon self - energy .",
    "the self - energy has a lorentz structure with large scalar and four - vector components and modifies the single - particle spectrum and the spinor wave functions .",
    "the relativistic brueckner model has been developed in the last decades by various authors . at the beginnig of the 80 s",
    "the relativistic problem was considered by the brooklyn group @xcite in first order perturbation theory . in the following the covariant formalism to a self - consistent treatment of the thompson equation",
    "was developed by horowitz and serot @xcite and is in detail outlined in ref .",
    ". however , in these works the nucleon - nucleon interactions was described within the framework of the @xmath0-model .",
    "calculations with realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions have been performed by brockmann and machleidt @xcite and later on by ter haar and malfliet @xcite .",
    "a more rigorous derivation of the brueckner approach in the framework of relativistic green s function can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work we refer to the formalism described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    the main difference between the relativistic brueckner approach of refs .",
    "@xcite and previous works is the use of medium dependent spinors and the requirement of self - consistency for both the spinor wave functions and the single - particle spectrum .",
    "the dirac spinors of the nucleon in the medium differ considerably from the free spinors due to the large scalar and vector self - energies .",
    "these introduce an additional density dependence into the spinor matrix elements of the one - boson exchange potentials and thus into the t - matrix .",
    "this dynamical effect is absent in non - relativistics .",
    "another new aspect of the modern brueckner approach is that the inertial frames where the t - matrix is determined and where it is used have to be distinguished carefully .",
    "due to the neglection of the retardation in the meson propagators the one - boson exchange potentials and the correspondingly t - matrix serve as quasi - potentials in the two - particle center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "therefore the relativistic thompson equation is solved in this system which can be done by numerical standard techniques , as , e.g. , in the non - relativistic case of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand single - particle quantities like the self - energy of the nucleon",
    "are calculated in the nuclear matter rest frame , where the single - particle distribution , the fermi sea , is naturally defined .",
    "thus a covariant representation of the t - matrix is required to connect both frames .",
    "even though , e.g. , the single particle potential can be calculated with some additional approximations avoiding this representation , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , the covariant technique is unavoidable in order to calculate the self - energy components themselves .    in the relativistic brueckner approach",
    "the self - consistent spinors are restricted to positive energy states .",
    "a different approach in the full dirac space which is also based on one - boson exchange potentials is used in refs .",
    "but in a full treatment one should further include renormalisation effects like the vacuum fluctuation contributions to the self - energy , as discussed in the context of the relativistic hartree approximation in refs .",
    "@xcite , and solve the full bethe - salpeter equation self - consistently .",
    "however , then the one - boson exchange potentials would be inappropriate .",
    "but these are still outstanding problems . in the standard brueckner model which we discuss in the present work one gets around the problem of renormalization .",
    "the masses and coupling constants in the model are physical renormalized quantities and as a consequence one neglects the effective negative - energy states .",
    "however , the effective positive - energy spinors still contain admixtures of free negative - energy states because they are a superposition of free positive- and negative - energy spinors . to lorentz transform the t - matrix as we have mentioned above the positive energy on - shell t - matrix",
    "is projected onto five invariant amplitudes . by the restriction to positive energy states",
    "an ambiguity arises @xcite which is discussed in terms of the pseudo - scalar and the pseudo - vector representation of the t - matrix in the dirac space . from analogy to the one - pion exchange coupling in the nucleon - nucleon potential",
    "the pseudo - vector choice is more natural and further it is known from meson theory analysis @xcite that this choice suppresses the coupling to the negative - energy states .",
    "however , the difference between both choices also states a measure for the uncertainty concerning the determination of the self - energy components due to the restriction on positive energy spinors .",
    "one issue of the present work is to estimate this uncertainty .",
    "thus , the aim of this work is to determine the self - energy components , to estimate their uncertainty due to different covariant representations of the t - operator and different nucleon - nucleon potentials and to examine the sensitivity of some commonly used observables , i.e. , the equation of state and the optical potential on the self - energies .",
    "we are investigating in detail the density and the momentum dependence of the scalar and the vector components and compare our results to those of other groups @xcite . thereby the momentum dependence can just be determined in a first approximation because it is neglected in the self - consistency treatment of the brueckner model .",
    "commonly this approximation is justified by the assumption of a weak momentum dependence , at least inside the fermi sea , but there have been also indications that this assumption depends on the chosen one - boson exchange potential @xcite .",
    "we show here for the first time the momentum dependence over its full range , i.e. , below and above the fermi surface , and we find it in the case of the bonn a , b , c potentials of the order of several 100 mev , i.e. , to be strikingly strong . in difference to the most publications in the field we focus our discussion to the self - energy components themselves .",
    "it is meanwhile well known that the nuclear matter saturation properties are much better reproduced in the relativistic than in the non - relativistic brueckner approach , i.e. , the predictions for the saturation point of a variety of nucleon - nucleon potentials are located along the _ coester band _ which meets  in the relativistic case  the empirical area @xcite .",
    "the same also holds , e.g. , for the nucleon optical potential .",
    "however , as we also find in the present analysis these commonly studied observables are not really sensitive to the self - energy components since they mainly depend on a cancellation of the components .",
    "the situation changes in the application of the brueckner theory beyond infinite nuclear matter . when applying relativistic brueckner results to the description of finite nuclei , e.g. , in the framework of an effective ( density dependent ) relativistic mean field theory @xcite the self - energies start to play a decisive role .",
    "this fact is , however , most pronounced in the investigation of heavy ion collisions .",
    "different from resting nuclear matter here the scalar and vector components are out of balance which is due to their different lorentz transformation character and diverse observables are in particular sensitive to the magnitude of the fields @xcite",
    ". furthermore the momentum space configuration can be highly anisotropic and rather corresponds to two counterstreaming currents of nuclear matter which can be described by two lorentz - elongated fermi ellipsoids .",
    "approximate determinations of relativistic brueckner mean fields for such configurations have been performed in @xcite and encouraging applications to heavy ion collisions in @xcite .",
    "thus the density and momentum dependence of the nuclear self - energy components as the quantity which most prominant characterizes the medium effects is a question of particular interest .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : in the next section we review the relativistic brueckner approach .",
    "there are still some technical differences in the _ standard _ brueckner model between ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "here we follow the approach of horowitz and serot @xcite which allows the use of standard techniques for the solution of the thompson equation known from earlier works @xcite . however , we use the modern one - boson exchange potentials , treat the isospin channels and also the real and imaginary part of the t - matrix separately and project on both , the pseudo - scalar and the pseudo - vector representation . in the following section we discuss our numerical results .",
    "the calculations with the @xmath0-potential are compared with results from ref .",
    "we further discuss the density and momentum dependence of the scalar and vector self - energy , the influence of pseudo - scalar and pseudo - vector choice is analyzed and we compare to the results of brockmann and machleidt @xcite and the groningen group @xcite .",
    "further the equation of state and the optical potential are shown and their sensitivity to the self - energy components is analyzed . in the final section",
    "a summary is given .",
    "in the relativistic brueckner approach the nucleon inside the nuclear medium may be viewed as a dressed particle in conseqeunce of its two - body interaction with the surrounding nucleons .",

    "the pauli operator @xmath4 accounts for the influence of the medium by the pauli principle and projects the intermediate scattering states outside the fermi sea .",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "this means that the decay width of the dressed nucleon is set equal to zero , resulting in an infinite lifetime of this quasiparticle. in the relativistic brueckner approach the full green function @xmath5 is replaced by its positive energy part . thus the self - energy in eq .",

    "in contrast to non - relativistic brueckner theory this fact introduces an additional density dependence into the interaction which is one major reason for the great success of the relativistic treatment .",

    "the thompson propagator ( and similar the blankenbecler sugar propagator ) projects the intermediate nucleons onto positive energy states and restricts the exchanged energy transfer by @xmath38 to zero .",

    "of course also the direct part is different from that of the pseudo - scalar case since we consider the self - consistently determined fields .",
    "we conclude that the pseudo - vector choice in general reduces the total self - energy which is due to a considerable reduction of the exchange contributions while the direct contributions are even enhanced .    in fig.5",

    "more strictly this is the real part of the self - energy since for momenta greater than the fermi momentum the self - energy is complex .",

    "for comparison we also show two results obtained by the groningen group . in ref .",
    "@xcite the self - energies above the fermi surface are calculated in a similar way as in the present work , see discussion of fig.5 .",

    "( [ eq24 ] ) , using the expression ( [ eq26 ] ) . for moderate densities",
    "the results agree with an accuracy better 0.5 mev and even for @xmath145 the deviation is less than 3 mev .",
    "firstly , this result is an additional test for the accuracy of our numerical treatment , i.e. , the projection of the t - matrix onto covariant amplitudes which are subsequently used to determine the self - energy components and the equation of state .",
    "secondly , these results again demonstrate that the equation of state is quite insensitive to the self - energy components themselves . actually , as can be seen clearly from the definition eq .",
    "( [ eq26 ] ) , the equation of state depends directly on the single - particle potential , i.e. , the difference of @xmath10 and @xmath126 , eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) , and relatively weak on the effective mass via the kinetic energy part .",
    "nevertheless , the relativistic effects are responsible in contrast to non - relativistic calculations that the minima of the equations of state for the three different bonn potentials reveal a coester band which meets the empirically found saturation area of nuclear matter .    in order to demonstrate the influence of the two different choices ,",
    "i.e. , pseudo - vector and pseudo - scalar on the equation of state in fig.9 we show the respective equation of state , again for bonn c. actually the expectation value @xmath146 of the full self - energy operator , eq .",
    "( [ eq16a ] ) , is identical for both choices @xcite .",
    "however , as can be seen from fig.9 the equation of state turns out to be rather sensitive on the different choices .",
    "this significant dependence is only due to the self - consistently iterated effective mass which differs in both approaches .",
    "this effect deepens the equation of state in the pseudo - scalar choice by around 1 to 2 mev and shifts the minimum towards higher densities .",
    "thus the saturation point is shifted away from the empirical point towards the results of non - relativistic brueckner calculations as , e.g. , published in ref .",
    "this observation additionally supports the pseudo - vector choice .    in view of the strong momentum dependence of the self - energy components for the bonn potentials one might expect that the results depend sensitive on the actual momentum reference value where the selfconsistent effective mass is determined . as a consequence",
    "a selfconsistent treatment of the full momentum dependence might appear to be indispensable .",
    "therefore we have also examined the influence of a different choice of the selfconsistent effective mass . in the reference spectrum approximation ,",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , @xmath29 is determined at the fermi surface which is the conventional treatment in the relativistic brueckner approach . however , this choice is by no means unique .",
    "thus we also determine @xmath29 by its mean value in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) @xmath147 the self - energies @xmath148 are not simply taken at @xmath36 but replaced by their values averaged over the fermi sea @xmath149 these averages are lorentz scalars .",
    "the extension of the reference spectrum approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq28 ] ) , is especially meaningful with respect to the treatment of anisotropic nuclear matter , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "it serves as a test of the influence of the momentum dependence . due to",
    "the strong momentum dependence observed , e.g. , in fig.7 the mean value @xmath150 differs considerably from @xmath151 , i.e. , by about 57 mev at saturation density ( with bonn c ) .",
    "respectively for the different effective masses we obtain a mean value @xmath152 mev which is smaller than the selfconsistent mass @xmath153 mev .",
    "but if we use the alternatively defined effective mass , eq .",
    "( [ eq28 ] ) , as iteration parameter we find for the final iterated mean value @xmath154 mev . thus the mean value is increased , i.e. , it is shifted towards the previous self - consistent result or , in other words , the selfconsistent value is rather stable .",
    "the comparison of the self - energy components @xmath155 in both iterations , see fig.2 , shows just slightly deviations , e.g. , about 10 mev at saturation density . and",
    "even more , the equation of state , shown in fig.9 , remains nearly unchanged .",
    "these results demonstrate that the strong momentum dependence has only minor influence on the density dependence of the self - energy components and that the equation of state remains unaffected .",
    "another quantity which is more sensitive on the momentum dependence of @xmath96 is the schroedinger equivalent optical potential which a nucleon feels inside the nuclear medium .",
    "the optical potential is given by @xmath156 it contains counteracting linear and quadratic terms in the self - energy components . for nucleons with @xmath157",
    "the momentum space is not completely blocked for scattering processes and thus above the fermi surface the self - energies and the optical potential become complex . the single - particle energy @xmath158 is a monotonic function of @xmath24 which allows by inversion to determine @xmath159 as function of the single - particle energy @xmath160 .",
    "we want to stress that neglecting the momentum dependence of the fields @xmath161 and neglecting completely @xmath121 the optical potential @xmath162 would simply be a linear function of @xmath160 . however , this is not the case here .",
    "real and imaginary part of the optical potential calculated for bonn c ( pseudo - vector choice ) are shown in fig.10 .",
    "the real part agrees well with the groningen results of ref .",
    "while the imaginary part of the present calculations is about twice as large . further we compare to the empirical optical potential hama i , table 2 of ref . @xcite .",
    "for the full range of single - particle energies up to 700 mev , shown in fig.10 , our results deviate from the empirical re @xmath162 by less than 10 mev . up to the pion production threshold at around 300 mev",
    "we observe a remarkable agreement of the imaginary part of @xmath162 with the empirical data . for single - particle energies above this region",
    "the results appear to be no more fully reliable since then meson - nucleon resonances , e.g. the @xmath163(1232 ) resonance , should be taken into account .",
    "in this work in particular the self - energy of a nucleon inside the nuclear medium has been studied in the framework of the relativistic brueckner approach .",
    "therefore the dependence of the lorentz scalar and vector self - energy components on the nuclear density and the nucleon momentum have been examined . as bare nucleon - nucleon interaction various one - boson exchange potentials",
    "have been employed , i.e. , the bonn a , b , c potentials and for comparison the @xmath0-exchange potential . for the latter we are able to nicely reproduce the density dependence of the self - energies of ref .",
    "the self - energy components themselves deviate for the three different bonn potentials over a wide density range only by a few mev and thus we restricted our discussion mainly to the bonn c potential . from the comparison with our results we find that the potential - fit method of ref .",
    "@xcite underpredicts the magnitude of the self - energies by about 50 up to more than 150 mev .",
    "further we analyzed the influence of different possible covariant representations of the t - matrix .",
    "the positive energy on - shell t - matrix is projected on five invariant amplitudes and by the restriction to positive energy states an ambiguity arises which is discussed in terms of the pseudo - scalar and the pseudo - vector representation . although the t - amplitudes of both choices are equal on the one - body level , i.e. , concerning the respective self - energy components a significant influence of these representations is observed .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the pseudo - scalar case direct and exchange contributions to the self - energies are equal while in the pseudo - vector choice the exchange part is suppressed . for the bonn potentials this suppression lies between 40 - 80 mev and",
    "is most prominant at low densities .",
    "this difference between both choices has to be interpreted as an inherent measure for an uncertainty of the approach due to the restriction on positive energy spinors .",
    "commonly the momentum dependence of the self - energy components is supposed to be weak .",
    "this assumption is also reflected in the self - consistency treatment in the relativistic brueckner model which is managed by just one density dependent parameter , i.e. , the self - consistent effective mass .",
    "therefore we have carefully examined this momentum dependence which , however , can be done within the bruckner scheme just in a first approximation . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we find that taking the @xmath0-exchange potential the self - energies are found to be constant below the fermi surface within a few percent .",
    "however , this result does not hold for the more realistic bonn potentials . here",
    "we observe a strong momentum dependence which may be due to the strong pion exchange .",
    "the self - energies decrease from their central value , i.e. , at @xmath164 to the fermi surface by about one fourth and further to @xmath165 gev by more than one half .",
    "this striking momentum dependence makes the treatment of the self - consistency in the model somewhat questionable . but a test with a different defined self - consistent effective mass which is determined by a mean value over the fermi sea and not taken at @xmath25 as usually done shows that the self - energy components are rather stable at not too high densities .",
    "thus the self - consistency treatment in the model still appears to be justified up to two or three times saturation density .    in this context",
    "the question raises which observables are sensitive to the self - energy components and their momentum dependence .",
    "it is remarkable that the full self - energy and , respectively , the single particle potential show ( absolutely ) a much weaker momentum dependence .",
    "as it is well known from mean field theory the large scalar and vector self - energy components contribute to these quantities with opposite signs and thus cancel each other to hight extent .",
    "the resulting observables , e.g. , the single particle potential are smaller by nearly one order of magnitude . here",
    "we found that this holds not only at @xmath25 but also over the full momentum range considered .",
    "thus the momentum dependence cancels to a large extent .",
    "also the equation of state depends mainly on the difference of the scalar and the vector self - energy and thus the absolute values of the single component are of minor importance .",
    "this can be seen most clearly by the use of just density dependent self - energy components determined with the potential - fit method of brockmann and machleidt @xcite which deviate from our results ( at @xmath25 ) by about 75 mev .",
    "the resulting binding energy , however , only deviates by about 1 mev .",
    "similarly the self - energy components obtained in the pseudo - scalar and the pseudo - vector choice differ considerable but the equations of state differ by less than one to two mev . on the other hand , small variations of the self - energy due to",
    "the different three bonn potentials produce a significant change in the equations of state .",
    "summarizing , the equation of state is not sensitive to the self - energy components themselves but to their difference .",
    "a bit more sensitive is another quantity , i.e. , the optical potential .",
    "it depends not only on the cancellation of the scalar and vector self - energy but also contains quadratic terms .",
    "we find a good agreement of our results with the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite for , both , the real and the imaginary part up to a single particle energy of several hundred mev .    as a resum ,",
    "the self - energy components in the relativistic brueckner model are still affected with some uncertainty . for realistic one - boson exchange potentials",
    "we find them to be strongly momentum dependent .",
    "however , for this attribute we have to be aware of the limits of the model .",
    "one major success of the relativistic approach was that the equation of state comes close to the empirical saturation point .",
    "the equation of state is rather insensitive to the self - energy components themselves .",
    "similarly , the nucleon optical potential is only little more sensitive .",
    "however , a precise knowledge of the size of each self - energy component is necessary , e.g. , in the much more complicate situation of heavy ion collisions .",
