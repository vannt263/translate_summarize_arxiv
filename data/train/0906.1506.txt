    "the question of the time that it takes for stochastic process to reach a specific point or state by the first time is central in many applications of stochastic modeling in physics ( kramers problem @xcite ) , chemistry ( reaction kinetics @xcite ) , biology ( neural activity models @xcite ) and economics ( estimation of the ruin time @xcite ) . for a random walk sequence , a nontrivial theorem due to sparre - andersen @xcite states that the asymptotic form of the probability @xmath0 of not crossing the boundary within the first @xmath1 steps after starting the motion at @xmath2 ( otherwise named the survival probability on the positive semi - axis ) does not depend on the form of a jump length distribution if only it is symmetric , continuous and markovian . for a large number of steps ,",
    "one invariably has regardless of the exact jump length distribution type ) @xmath3 , where the prefactor @xmath4 depends on the initial position .",
    "the result can be easily generalized for the continuous - time version of the process . for",
    "unbiased , continuous gaussian random walk its first passage time density ( fptd ) from @xmath5 to @xmath6 can be easily calculated explicitly @xcite : let us denote @xmath7 the probability of motion from a position @xmath5 to @xmath8 in time @xmath9 with @xmath6 denoting the position on the way from @xmath5 to @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath10 . by taking @xmath11 as the probability of arriving for the first time at @xmath6 at time @xmath12 , the equation for @xmath13 reads @xmath14 with its laplace transform given by @xmath15 for unbiased gaussian random walk we have @xmath16 . with the laplace",
    "transform @xmath17 one obtains @xmath18 which , by inverse laplace transform , yields the lvy - smirnov distribution @xmath19 where @xmath5 represents the initial condition .",
    "this `` inverse gaussian distribution '' decays for long times as @xmath20 and does not have a first moment , i.e. the mean first passage time from @xmath5 to @xmath6 diverges . on the other hand , since @xmath21 , the particle performing the one dimensional gaussian random walk will certainly hit any point @xmath6 during its motion .",
    "assuming the absorbing boundary located at the origin , i.e. at @xmath22 , formula ( [ eq : l - s ] ) with @xmath22 gives the probability density of the first passage time from the positive semi - axis for a gaussian random walk .",
    "it should be stressed , however that for generally non - gaussian noises , the knowledge of the boundary location may be insufficient to specify in full the corresponding conditions for absorption or reflection @xcite . in particular trajectories of lvy walks",
    "may exhibit discontinuous jumps and in a consequence , the location of the boundary itself is not hit by the majority of sample trajectories . in order to properly take care of possible excursion of the trajectories beyond the location of the boundary ( at , say @xmath22 ) with subsequent re - crossings into the interval ( @xmath23 )",
    ", the whole semi - line ( @xmath24 ) has to be assumed `` absorbing '' .",

    "( [ eq : l - s ] ) , dictated by the sparre - andersen theorem holds also true for `` paradoxical '' diffusion - like processes studied in terms of ctrw ( continuous time random walks ) where kinetics of the walker is determined by the distribution of jump lengths and distribution of waiting times before a next jump to occur @xcite . if the process is regular in time but with nontrivial jump distribution following the ( symmetric ) lvy law of stability ( so called symmetric lvy flight ) , the first passage time density ( fptd ) follows the sparre - andersen universality @xcite .",
    "notably , however , if subordinating the number of steps @xmath1 to the physical clock time @xmath9 such that the number of steps @xmath1 per unit of physical time follows some distribution with a power - law tail @xmath25 with @xmath26 , the deviations from the universality can be observed @xcite .    to further elucidate the nature of deviation from the `` standard '' sparre - andersen scaling in subordinated scenarios",
    ", we consider the process @xmath27 , for which the parental process @xmath28 is described by a langevin equation @xcite @xmath29 driven by a symmetric @xmath30-stable lvy motion @xmath31 with the fourier transform @xmath32 . here",

    "the subordinator @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 denoting a strictly increasing @xmath37-stable lvy motion ( @xmath38 ) and is assumed to be independent from the noise term @xmath31 .",

    "occurrence of the operator @xmath40 is due to the heavy - tailed waiting times between successive jumps and presence of the riesz fractional derivative @xmath43 is a consequence of the lvy - flight character of the jumps .    in this paper , instead of seeking an analytical solution to eq .  ( [ eq : ffpe ] ) , we switch to a monte carlo method @xcite which allows generating trajectories of the subordinated process @xmath46 with the parent process @xmath28 .",

    "the assumed algorithm provides means to investigate the competition between subdiffusion ( controlled by @xmath37-parameter ) and lvy flights characterized by a stability index @xmath30 .    for markov processes ,",
    "the sparre - andersen scaling @xcite presents a universal law which is independent of detailed properties of the jump length distribution ( if it is only continuous and symmetric ) .",
    "in particular , for continuous times , the scaling predicts the @xmath48 decay of the survival probability , independently of whether the moments of the underlying jump process exist or not .",
    "for example , for @xmath49 , the moments of the process @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) ) exist only for @xmath50 with obvious divergence of moments of order @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 this divergence can be easily demonstrated in the case of ( pure ) lvy flights described by eq .",

    "in such a case , the @xmath55 is a lvy stable density ( whose width is growing with time ) and @xmath56 stays infinite for @xmath57 .",
    "clearly , for finite time @xmath9 and finite number of representative trajectories @xmath58 ( otherwise called realizations of the process @xmath46 ) , variance @xmath59 of ( symmetric ) lvy flights stays finite , see ( * ? ? ? * eq .  ( 1.19 ) ) and @xcite .",
    "in fact , finite number of realizations ( to be distinguished from the number of steps @xmath1 used in simulation of a single trajectory of time duration @xmath60 ) and finite time introduce an effective cutoff to the jump length distribution .",
    "in contrast , for any fixed time the variance diverges with increasing number of simulated trajectories @xmath58 .",
    "analogously , for any fixed @xmath58 , the variance diverges with increasing time ( scaling like @xmath61 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 1.19 ) ) and @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of mathematical divergence can be resolved either by introducing spatiotemporal coupling ( typical for so called lvy walks @xcite ) or by proper truncation of the jump length distribution @xcite .",
    "several truncation methods have been proposed @xcite to retain the finite second moment . in particular , paralleling the simulation studies of mantegna and stanley @xcite , a smooth exponential cutoff has been introduced by koponen @xcite . instead of truncating tails of a distribution ,",
    "this approach is based upon the exponential tempering of the lvy density and preserves the infinite - divisibility @xcite of the distribution .",
    "the classical tempered stable distribution has been further generalized by rosiski ( for more detailed discussion see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5.7 ) and @xcite ) .",
    "for systems driven by symmetric process the generalized sparre - andersen scaling @xcite can be used to discriminate between markovian and non - markovian situations . more precisely , according to the sparre - andersen theorem for a stochastic processes driven by any symmetric white noises , the first passage time densities , @xmath62 , from the real half line asymptotically behave like @xmath63 consequently the survival probability @xmath64 , i.e. the probability of finding a particle starting its motion at @xmath65 in the real ( positive ) half line , scales like @xmath66 therefore , any deviation of the survival probability from @xmath48 dependence indicates violation of assumptions assuring the proof of the theorem .",
    "it can mean either that a system is driven by non - symmetric or not `` memory - less '' driving . in consequence , for symmetric drivings , analysis of data based on ( assumed a priori )",
    "sparre - andersen scaling may reveal deviations from markovianity .",

    "[ fig : exponents ] .",
    "value of the exponent @xmath77 is the decreasing function of the subdiffusion parameter @xmath37 leading to the slowest decay of the survival probability for small values of the @xmath37 parameter , i.e. when the exponent @xmath37 deviates the most from its markovian",
    " `` memory - less '' value  1 .",
    "the deviation of the exponent @xmath77 from @xmath76 clearly indicates a typical slowing down of the subdiffusive process in comparison to its ( markov ) regular diffusion analogue .",
    "the @xmath30-independence of the survival probability @xmath64 in this case shows that the properties of the decay kinetics are determined by the subdiffusive part of the process only .",
    "this observation is different from the results obtained by sokolov and metzler for a class of lvy random processes subordinated ( via the relation connecting distribution of number of jumps @xmath1 in physical time @xmath9 ) to lvy flights or to brownian random walks . in particular , in their derivation of subordination , the authors are using the markovian lvy flight process @xmath46 transformed to the process @xmath85 by use of the operational time @xmath86 which , by itself , is called the directing process @xmath87 .",

    "we have created trajectories of the process @xmath27 with @xmath34 being the inverse time @xmath30-stable subordinator .",

    "information gained from the analysis of generated trajectories brings around further confirmation of non - markov property of the motion @xcite .",
