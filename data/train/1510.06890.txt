    "the concept of electromagnetic cloaking has now been with us for almost ten years @xcite , but has been recently revitalized by the introduction of the concept of space - time cloaking @xcite and its variety of implementations @xcite in light of the many variants of spatial cloaking , and of applications in acoustics @xcite and diffusion of heat or light @xcite , it is worth considering how to combine these different applications and approaches into a unified `` transformation design '' ( t - design ) scheme , at least to the extent possible .",
    "some progress has been made in that regard , but with a firm focus on wave mechanics expressed in a first - order form @xcite .",
    "here we take an exclusively second order approach to the situation .",
    "although less detailed than the first - order approach , notably in the way it does not recognise impedance at all , it has some significant advantages . in any case , when it comes to actual devices  _ transformation devices _ ( t - devices )  often impedances are ruthlessly ignored or rescaled to suit the technological demands of the programme ; thus an interest in impedance could be considered  to some extent  somewhat over careful .",
    "t - devices that can not ( or do not ) attempt to control scattering or reflections from impedance mismatches have a performance left hostage to the physics of the wave or ray they attempt to manipulate .",
    "notably , we expect that in principle electromagnetic ( em ) t - devices are less imperfect than acoustic ones @xcite .    here",
    "we start by taking the simplest scalar helmholtz equation as describing our wave system , and see how it can be easily modified to allow for anisotropy . since , to a great degree , any wave type can be sufficiently well modelled  in appropriate limits  by the helmholtz equation , this is not a particularly stringent restriction . by a simple and straightforward recasting of the mathematics ,",
    "we show how it can be put into a form dependent on a metric @xmath0 ; at which point we can apply the concept of transformation design as a mathematical morphism between a reference or `` design '' solution and a t - device application ; the extraction of material parameters from the morphed / transformed metric  for whatever physical system is of interest  is then solely a problem of calculation .    in section [ s - theory ] we present the basic wave , ray , and diffusion machinery , and how the material properties map onto the effective metric in the form of a speed - squared matrix , in section [ s - transformations ] we show how the metric morphs under transformation , and in section [ s - examples ] we give examples .",
    "finally , in section [ s - conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "in what follows we will generalise on the common helmholtz equation approach for t - design to allow for anisotropy of the propagation in the simplest possible way .",
    "we then demonstrate how this generalization allows a unified process for designing t - devices for almost any sort of wave , ray , or diffusion .",
    "this is because all these types of processes can have their mathematical expression and behaviour mapped onto the metric seen by the process , so that a transmorphation of a metric is sufficent to determine the necessary material parameters for the chosen t - device .",
    "the most general type of second order wave model is given by the covariant wave equation on a manifold where the spatial part of the metric @xmath1 has its inverse counterpart @xmath2 .",
    "in indexed notation using the einstein summation convention , with greek indices spanning @xmath3 , latin ones spanning @xmath4 , and treating the time coordinate @xmath5 separately from space , this is   @xmath6 we justify this space vs time split by considering a particular lorentz frame in spacetimes with @xmath7 ( so that @xmath8 also ) and a fixed @xmath9 ( and hence fixed @xmath10 ) . here",
    "both `` @xmath11 '' and @xmath12 denote covariant derivatives , whereas @xmath13 are partial derivatives .",
    "this equation is for some scalar quantity @xmath14 , but the generalization to other types of waves is straightforward . note that for wave processes , we typically have @xmath15 .",
    "we could compare eqn .",
    "to a helmholtz equation for a homogeneous isotropic medium ( e.g. consider light travelling in an ordinary block of glass ) . a typical helmholtz equation , with the vector calculus gradient operator @xmath16 recast using @xmath17 , can straighforwardly be recast as   @xmath18    h({\\textbf{r}},t ) & =    0 .",
    "\\label{eqn - basic - nabla2ec2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have placed the @xmath19 wave property between the two spatial derivatives because it is often more natural  and less approximate  for it to appear there , especially if ( e.g. ) this second order form was derived by combining two first order equations , such as in em or the simplified p - acoustics model @xcite .",
    "the use of a squared property is also worthy of note  it has also been argued that the refractive index squared is a much more relevant quantity than index @xmath20 in optical propagation @xcite , in particular as to how it affects the best definition of wavevector in the presence of significant gain or loss .    if we compare eqns .",
    "and we can see that they have a very similar form  the difference being that the isotropic speed squared @xmath19 has been replaced by the potentially anisotropic inverse metric @xmath2 .",
    "thus the somewhat abstract notion of the inverse of the metric on a manifold can be replaced by the concrete and intuitive notion of a speed ( squared ) matrix ( which we will denote using the fraktur ` c ' character as @xmath21 ) .",
    "so rather than thinking just of an ordinary ( and isotropic ) block of glass , as suggested above for eqn .",
    ", we might now imagine a uni- or biaxial crystal with orientation dependent refractive indices .",
    "further , note that if birefringence was present , we would require one @xmath21 matrix for each polarization .",
    "allowing anisotropy by considering materials with a speed matrix @xmath21 rather than an isotropic @xmath19 is crucial for the field of transformation media : the process of designing transformation devices ( t - devices ) relies on the introduction or alteration of material properties that differ along different directions , as well as differing still more at different locations @xcite .",
    "even the simplest possible transformation  a single axis compression  induces anisotropy , thus , any kind of general transformation theory , general or not , must incorporate it .",
    "the sole exception exists for t - devices designed by means of conformal maps @xcite , but note that conformal cloaks are limited in that they work only for a single specific orientation , and only in two dimensions .",
    "our wave equation in terms of @xmath21 is now   @xmath22    h({\\textbf{r}},t ) & =    0 .",
    "\\label{eqn - basic - nabla2ec2aniso}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to summarize the treatment of waves as discussed here , we assume that _ any _ wave - like excitation , if sufficiently tightly specified , can be described by the second order helmholtz wave equation . on this basis we can regard , in well - founded , but somewhat restricted terms , the helmholtz equation as the defining description of wave processes  i.e. any wavelike excitation of a field or material follows ( in some suitable limit ) an archetypical helmholtz formula with material properties contained in a speed - squared matrix @xmath21 .",
    "a ray treatment does not even require the derivation of a ray - optics or eikonal limit .",
    "this is because our t - design process has ( or will have ) provided us with a spatial metric @xmath1 , which we know corresponds in inverse to the speed squared matrix @xmath23 .",
    "given this , can use the fact that any ray subject to a metric must follow the geodesic equation @xcite   @xmath24    expressed in two coupled first - order pieces , it is   @xmath25 where @xmath26 \\label{eqn - connection - gammas } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although the @xmath27 are coordinate choice dependent , the geodesic equation does show how a geodesic traverses the space , and that interesting geodesic behaviour depends on the existence of variation in the properties of the metric . the crucial thing to note here",
    "is that just as for the helmholtz style second order wave equation , the controlling property for the geodesics  for motion or transport across the manifold  is the metric .",
    "it is also worth noting that the geodesic equation can be rearranged from that given above into   @xmath28 which could be regarded as the generalized eikonal equation .",
    "indeed , one can start from the covariant wave equation , and by making the usual short - wavelength and ray - limit approximations , derive eqn . in a comparable way as for the ordinary eikonal equation for isotropic materials .",
    "we will consider two types of equation under the heading `` diffusion '' .",
    "firstly , although not usually regarded as a diffusion equation , we can flip the sign on the time derivative term of the helmholtz equation .",
    "this amounts to choosing @xmath29 in the covariant form . to emphasize that we intend to treat diffusion - like processes ,",
    "we replace the inverse metric @xmath30 not with a speed squared matrix @xmath21 but a diffusion matrix @xmath31 , so that   @xmath32    h({\\textbf{r}},t ) & =    0 .",
    "\\label{eqn - basic - nabla2diffusions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus it is straightforward to see that whatever mathematical process worked or works for the usual covariant wave equation as described above will work identically for this  as long as we do not implement any temporal or spacetime transformations .    more traditional diffusion equations  or even schrdinger type equations  which contain only a first order time derivative can also be treated under the same helmholtz - based machinery outlined above .",
    "this allows us to bring calculations such as that of the heat diffusion cloak @xcite into the unified picture described in this work .    to demonstrate how the transformation schemes for waves and diffusions follow the same process , we first define a `` shadow '' helmholtz equation for a field @xmath33 , intended to mimic a diffusion equation in some suitable limit ]",
    "for this we require an added @xmath34 source term on the rhs , and to define a new diffusive field quantity @xmath35 related to the shadow field @xmath33 with @xmath36 .",
    "this means that   @xmath37    { s}({\\textbf{r}},t ) & =    \\alpha^2 { s}({\\textbf{r}},t ) , \\\\",
    "\\left [      \\partial_i        { { \\mathfrak{{c}}}}\\indices{^{ij } }",

    "\\label{eqn - diffusion - nabla2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we then assume that there is some large enough value of @xmath38 so that @xmath35 will always vary slowly compared to @xmath39 , i.e.   @xmath40 and so we can drop the @xmath41 term from the above equation since it is negligible .",
    "if we also match the source - like parameter @xmath42 to @xmath38 with @xmath43 , we can rearrange eqn . and put @xmath44 to get   @xmath45    { { { h}_s}}({\\textbf{r}},t ) & =    0 .",
    "\\label{eqn - diffusion - reorg2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this has the same form as a diffusion or schrdinger equation , if the appropriate interpretation of the parameters is made . and",
    "although the ordinary schrdinger equation only incorporates a scalar mass , when in periodic potentials , such as those in found in crystals , anisotropic effective masses often arise @xcite .    as a result of the above calculation , given any diffusion / schrdinger equation of the form eqn",
    "we can choose a sufficiently large @xmath38 , calculate the effective @xmath46 , transform it in the way described below to get the desired device s effective speed squared @xmath47 , and then the desired device s diffusion @xmath48 .",
    "note that the properties of field @xmath49 and parameter @xmath38 are only constrained by the need to satisfy the approximation on eqn . ;",
    "they are merely used to define a `` shadow '' helmholtz equation which is not intended to have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "it is only necessary that we can connect this transformable shadow system to the physical diffusive equation , so that we can work out how diffusions transform .    indeed ,",
    "since @xmath38 is a simple scalar and @xmath50 is directly proportional to @xmath51 , we can just transform @xmath50 directly to determine the necessary t - device diffusion properties .",
    "although general equations such as eqns . , , or are invaluable starting points , in general we need to justify their use based on particular physical models .",
    "these models then will show us what constitutive or material parameters will combine , and in what way they combine , to form the effective metric for that type of wave . here",
    "we will do this following our previous work which attempted a unification of t - optics and t - acoustics @xcite ; i.e. we derive second order wave equations directly from a generalization of a p - acoustic model @xcite , as well as from electromagnetism ( em ) .",
    "one critical point about any derivation that proceeds from the original first order equations for either p - acoustics or em is that we assume the underlying constitutive parameters have a limited spatial and temporal dependence ; typically we at least assume that they vary slowly enough on the scale of a wavelength ; this constraint is in accordance with that specifying that the determinant of the metric undergoes negligible change in the simplifed covariant wave equation .    in the case of generalized p - acoustics ,",
    "the equations for velocity field @xmath52 , and momentum density @xmath53 , in combination with quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be written in an indexed form . in the rest frame of the acoustic medium",
    ", we have   @xmath56 where we also need to know that @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "as expected , the momentum density field is related to the velocity field by a matrix of mass - density parameters @xmath59 .    for ordinary p - acoustics ,",
    "@xmath54 is a scalar field representing the local population , and @xmath60 repesents the bulk modulus ; as a result @xmath61 so that @xmath62 is a pressure field .",
    "there is also a version of p - acoustics that mimics pentamode materials @xcite , where the modulus @xmath63 is a symmetric matrix but @xmath64 .",
    "most generally , p - acoustics allows the case where @xmath63 and @xmath65 can be ( at least in principle ) any symmetric matrix ; in this case @xmath54 represents the amplitude of an oscillating stress field whose orientation is determined by @xmath66 , and where the restoring stress is @xmath65 is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "the usual process for generating a second order wave equation then leads straightforwardly to   @xmath67 with a speed - squared matrix @xmath68 that depends on the bulk modulus @xmath69 and the mass density i.e.   @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    in the case of",
    "em we can rewrite the vector maxwell equations in an indexed form which incorporates the vector cross product by turning the electric and magnetic fields @xmath72 and @xmath73 into antisymmetrized matrices @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; these also match up with the purely spatial parts of the em tensors @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the indexed equations , which also can be extracted from a matrix representation of the covariant tensor maxwell equations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , can be written ,   @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . as a result",
    "the speed - squared matrix depends on antisymetrized versions of the permitivitty @xmath81 and inverse permeability @xmath82 ; and are segments ( blocks ) excised from the dual of the constitutive tensor as used by kinsler and mccall @xcite for the dual of the usual em constitutive tensor @xmath83 , it denoted this only by the alternate indexing , not ( as would often be done ) by @xmath84 . also , it is helpful to note that if the vector components of the usual electric displacement @xmath85 are denoted @xmath86 for @xmath87 and are related to @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) by the usual vector - calculus style expression   @xmath90 then the components of the @xmath91-th slice of @xmath92 in eqn . are   @xmath93 & =    \\frac{1}{2 }    \\begin{bmatrix }       0                  &   -\\varepsilon_{jz }   & + \\varepsilon_{jy } \\\\      + \\varepsilon_{jz }   &    0                  & -\\varepsilon_{jx } \\\\",

    "they are   @xmath95 and for homogeneous material parameters leads to a multi - polarization speed - squared matrix which is   @xmath96 where the simpler form indicated by the arrow assumes the typical case where the constitutive parameters provide no cross - coupling between polarizations .    as a final emphasis as to the value of the `` speed squared '' denomination of a t - device , note that a determination of the water wave speed profile was the natural one to use when designing and building the maxwell s fishpond @xcite .",
    "the above shows us what material parameters will need to be engineered to control either waves or rays for acoustic - like or em scenarios .",
    "the next piece of the puzzle is to show what material parameters need to be manipulated to control diffusion processes .",
    "since an important case of diffusion is defined by the heat diffusion equation , and it is one already considered by the t - design community @xcite , we will start there .",
    "the diffusion equation for a temperature distribution @xmath97 , is often written in ordinary vector calculus notation as @xmath98 for density @xmath99 , specific heat @xmath100 , and potentially anisotropic thermal conductivity matrix with components @xmath101 .",
    "the positioning of @xmath102 in this equation is the `` natural '' one , and has not required any approximation involving slow / negligible spatial variation .",
    "here we first take a step back and write two first order equations in a style reminiscent of p - acoustics and the presentation of em as above .",
    "although in the following we examine heat diffusion in particular , the equations are equally applicable to other diffusion processes , as long as the appropriate reinterpretations of the physical variables are made .",
    "we therefore start with a conservation equation relating an energy density @xmath103 and an energy flux @xmath52 which is   @xmath104 we then rewrite the usual expression relating heat flux @xmath53 to temperature profile @xmath105 which is @xmath106 using a ` temperature impulse ' @xmath107 as   @xmath108 here the temperature profile is allowed to be anisotropic , which does not necessarily have a clear physical meaning ; typically we will expect @xmath109 to be diagonal .    with the assumption that @xmath109 is proportional to @xmath103 , but @xmath110 and @xmath111 are related by a first order differential equation , we ( can ) write the following constitutive relations ( equations of state ) ,   @xmath112 here @xmath113 plays the role of the inverse of the product @xmath114 .",
    "note that we will also need @xmath115 .",
    "substitution of eqn . into eqn .",
    "then gives us   @xmath116 this is just a diffusion equation for @xmath103 , and if @xmath113 is homogeneous ( or has negligible spatial variation ) , then   @xmath117 where in comparison to the original @xmath101 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 quantities ,   @xmath118    following this , we now know how to relate the heat equation parameters to the diffusion , and hence to the transformed metric , just as for the wave and ray theories already described .",
    "note that other diffusion equations can also easily be recast into the form used above .",
    "from the preceeding section , we can see that both ( second order ) wave and ray propagation , and even diffusion processes can be packaged in a way dependent on the same mathematics ; and that how that mathematics describes propagation depends intimately on the metric .",
    "the question now is  for a chosen transformation ( deformation ) of some kind , how do we calculate how the metric must change , if we insist that the wave normals , and ray trajectories ( geodesics ) , are shifted _ only _ by that deformation .",
    "( diffeo)-morphism .",
    "points @xmath119 in the reference manifold @xmath120 are mapped to points @xmath121 in the t - device manifold @xmath122 by the morphism ( mapping ) @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath124 coordinate representation of the morphism , is @xmath125 .",
    "this means that the _ design _ of the t - device is specified by @xmath123 , but that expression of that design in coordinate terms  the `` blueprint ''  is @xmath126 in @xmath124 . ]",
    "if we adhere to the traditional coordinate - based interpretation of t - design , then we can transform the metric simply with the notional coordinate transform that we use to define our desired t - device .",
    "coordinate transformations of representations of tensors depend on the differential relationships between the old and new coordinates , i.e.   @xmath127    so a metric @xmath128 and its inverse re - represented in new primed coordinates would be   @xmath129",
    "so , in the standard t - design paradigm if the coordinate transformation has the effect of changing our reference case geodesics into new , useful , device geodesics ; then we need to adapt our material parameters from the reference values to those that give rise to the t - device metric @xmath130 .",
    "we have already seen that an expression of a metric @xmath0 can be inverted to give speed - squared matrix @xmath21 ; thus the inverted t - device metric @xmath131 tells us what the t - device speed - squared matrix @xmath132 must be .",
    "our knowledge of whatever chosen physical system we want to build the device using then tells us what material properties are needed to achieve the necessary @xmath132 and hence implement the t - device .",
    "however : _ if any physical idea must be expressible in a way that is independent of coordinates ; how can any claimed `` coordinate transformation '' hope to represent the design or specification of a new device ? _    in what follows , we present a more sophisticated method which encapsulates the necesary mathematical and physical steps needed to implement the process of t - design .",
    "the mathematical underpinning of all transformation theories is in fact not that of coordinate transformation , but that of a _ morphism _ @xmath133 that maps a point @xmath119 on a reference ( `` design '' ) manifold @xmath120 to another point @xmath134 in a `` device '' manifold @xmath122 , as seen on fig .",

    "now we need to work out how to specify the device metric @xmath139 , as induced by @xmath133 , in terms of the reference / design metric @xmath140",
    ". often @xmath140 will just be a flat minkowski metric @xmath141 , but not always .",
    "the morphed / device metric is specified by   @xmath142 where we have to _ pull back _",
    "@xmath143 , @xmath144 with respect to the diffeomorphism @xmath133 . with some thought",
    ", we can see that this should be the expected behaviour : what we usually are typically trying to achieve is to make interesting trajectories into the `` new normal '' .",
    "e.g. we make a cloak - like device structure in the laboratory , with specified cloak - like wave or ray paths , into an actual cloak by insisting its properties are such that those paths look to the outside world as if they were in an unremarkable piece of vacuum .",
    "i.e. , we are trying to make a device ( cloak ) manifold @xmath122 look like the design ( vacuum ) manifold @xmath120 , and not the other way around .",
    "we can also write down an indexed form of the morphism @xmath133 . with @xmath145 referring to the indexing of @xmath122 , and @xmath146 referring to the indexing of @xmath120",
    ", we have that   @xmath147 note that here the positioning of the asterisk denoting ( in subscript ) push forward , or ( in superscript ) pull back , turns out to be irrelevant ; the indexing already carries the necessary information .",
    "quantities like @xmath148 are to be evaluated at @xmath119 and those like @xmath149 are evaluated at @xmath150 .",
    "we just need to remember that @xmath151 and @xmath152 . hence eqn .",
    "tells us how to calculate the metric and its inverse in indexed notation , i.e.   @xmath153    we might instead retain the asterisk denoting push forward and pull back , but desist from overloading the indexing typography .",
    "this is the scheme that we will follow in the next section which treats some specific examples , and leads to   @xmath154    notably , if we were to replace the `` @xmath155 '' notation with a coordinate - transform mimicking `` @xmath156 '' , then the operations done here , in this more sophisticated push - forward/ pull - back would match the use in the coordinate transform approach ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; albeit with the significant additional advantage of being mathematically and physically correct .",
    "it is critical to notice at this point that if we specify the morphism in terms of how one coordinate point is moved to another , then we are only adjusting distances ; i.e. only adjusting the effective metric .",
    "the morphism does not directly specify how other properties such as field values , ratios , or impedances have been affected .",
    "however , all geometric objects are nevertheless implicitly transformed by the morphism , even though the morphing process here is only targetted at the speed - squared matrix @xmath51 ( i.e. the inverse metric ) , and nothing else . however , it is possible to transform these independently if we so choose @xcite .",
    "for example , choosing the usual kappa medium assumption of `` @xmath157 '' in an electromagnetic scenario has implications for impedance @xcite , but such an identification has nothing to do with the morphism itself , which says nothing about the @xmath158 ratio .",
    "indeed , the specification of a physical system in which to implement our desired t - design  which may or may not turn out to be em  _ need not even have been decided yet . _",
    "as noted above , typically t - devices are described with a `` transformation '' narrative , where we talk of transforming an unremarkable reference space into an interesting device space .",
    "hence the typical description of a cloaking transformation being that a point in a flat space is expanded and pushed outwards to form a disk , and where ( outwardly ) the inside of that disk ( `` core '' ) region is invisible .    in the more rigorous morphism language",
    "we instead represent the deformation that takes the device ( or `` laboratory '' ) space manifold ( @xmath122 ) , with its missing disk , and alters the metric on that manifold so as to  pull it inwards. as a result @xmath122 then acts as if it were like a design ( i.e. apparent , or `` reference '' ) manifold ( @xmath120 ) only missing a single point .",
    "this is the reverse narrative of the ( usual ) transformation one , and the mathematical and physical reasons for this were described in the previous section .",
    "however , the reason why the usual transformation narrative is not without its uses is that non - trival reference manifolds might have metrics and geodesics with all kinds of interesting properties , involving ones that have foci , caustics , or that form loops . and whatever the exotic properties of our t - device might be in re - presenting the physical reality to an observer , it must be capable of being mapped onto that apparent manifold . by starting a design process with the intended ( design ) behaviour , and morphing ( push forward ) to the device behaviour guarantees that our aim is achievable , at least in principle .",
    "this specification means that the morphism should also have differentiable inverse , i.e. be a diffeomorphism .    in the examples below",
    ", the necessary device metric @xmath159 can be calculated from the design metric @xmath160 using the components @xmath161 of the design morphism @xmath133 .",
    "using square brackets to indicate a matrix - like representation , we find that   @xmath162 here the second line represents the next , more pragmatic step , where the device metric is inverted to generate the speed - squared matrix @xmath163 $ ] that we need to engineer using the relevant material properties .",
    "note that this transformation also uses the @xmath164 pull back form of the morphism @xmath133 . in the examples that follow ,",
    "we will use the phrase `` non - trivial '' to describe any diffeomorphism components @xmath165 that differ from the identity transformation value of @xmath166 .",
    "for example , if we chose to restrict ourselves to a cylindrical geometry , with only radial transformations , the only non - trival components will be radial ones .",
    "further , we also show only ray examples , because strictly speaking only in the ray limit is the metric approach exact . in any case",
    ", the literature is already full of wave - cloak pictures for various degrees of approximation in the underlying model .",
    "a careful analysis demonstrating of the effects of the neglected impedance and metric determinant terms is no simple matter , and is addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the cylindrical cloak first introduced by pendry et al @xcite is the most famous t - device .",
