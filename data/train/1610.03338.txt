    "one of the goals of lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) is to provide a first principles description of the qcd phase diagram and of the nonperturbative behaviour of the strongly interacting thermal medium . beyond their purely theoretical interest ,",
    "such informations are valuable for a better understanding of several phenomenologically relevant processes , among which heavy ions ultrarelativistic collisions play a dominant role .",
    "the study of the thermodynamical properties of qcd at vanishing baryon density by means of lqcd numerical simulations is a standard ( although not computationally easy ) task .",
    "when a nonzero baryon density is present this is no more true : the usual importance sampling monte carlo methods used in lqcd simulations can not be used anymore , due to the well known sign problem .",
    "the only physically relevant case in which the sign problem can be circumvented is the case of small baryon density or , more precisely , small baryon chemical potential @xmath0 : if we are interested in the observable @xmath1 , we can expand it as @xmath2 and try to estimate the coefficients of the series .",
    "which values of @xmath0 are `` small enough '' for this procedure to give reliable results is something that can only be determined _ a posteriori _ , given the accuracy that one can obtain in the evaluation of the expansion coefficients .",
    "this general idea can be implemented in two different ways : in the approach known as the taylor expansion method , the coefficient @xmath3 is obtained by evaluating @xmath4 using standard @xmath5 simulations @xcite . in the analytic continuation approach , simulations performed at imaginary values of the chemical potential @xmath6 ( at which no sign problem is present ) are performed , and the coefficients @xmath3 are then extracted by fitting the results @xcite .",
    "the two approaches have complementary advantages and drawbacks : in the taylor expansion method the coefficients @xmath3 are directly obtained , but their estimators become more and more noisy as @xmath7 is increased ; in the analytic continuation method the @xmath3 values have to be fitted , but one can use observables with good signal to noise ratios .    a property of the qcd phase diagram that can be investigated by using lqcd simulations is the dependence , at least for small values of @xmath0 , of the ( pseudo)critical temperature on the baryon chemical potential : @xmath8 can be developed in even powers of @xmath0 , and the curvature @xmath9 of the critical line is defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the ( pseudo)critical temperature at @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the curvature of the qcd ( pseudo)critical line with the curvature of the freeze - out curve extracted from heavy ion collisions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "while there is no compelling theoretical reason for the critical and the freeze - out lines to coincide ( in fact the first is an equilibrium property of qcd while the second depends also on out - of - equilibrium properties of the strongly interacting medium ) , a precise quantitative comparison of these observables could help in better understanding the physical processes involved in the cooling of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "at vanishing baryon chemical potential a real phase transition is not present , but just an analytic crossover ; as a consequence it is important to specify the observable used in the determination of @xmath8 , since different observables can in principle lead to different results .",
    "all lqcd results that will be discussed in the following refer to observables related to the restoration of the chiral symmetry ( chiral condensate or chiral susceptibility ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : summary ] for a graphical summary of the results .",
    "given the great phenomenological significance of the curvature of the qcd ( pseudo)critical line , after the seminal works @xcite several lqcd groups recently got involved in new computations of @xmath9 , with the principal aim of improving the control of the systematics .",
    "the analytic continuation method is attractive in this respect , since it enables to compute @xmath8 using the same standard procedures that are used in the @xmath5 case : looking for the inflection point of the chiral condensate or the maximum of the chiral susceptibility @xmath12 ( see @xcite for a discussion of the effect on @xmath9 of different renormalization procedures ) .",
    "a new source of systematics is in this case the fitting procedure , that however can be kept well under control by checking , e.g. , the dependence of the results on the fit range used , see fig .",
    "[ fig : syst ] .",
    "another improvement with respect to the first determinations is a better understanding of the role played by the quark chemical potentials : for the results to be of direct physical relevance in heavy ions collisions , the chemical potentials have to be tuned in such a way that the total strangeness vanishes and the electric charge is related to the baryon number by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "the first studies @xcite adopted the chemical potential setup @xmath15 , @xmath16 and in @xcite the setup @xmath17 was used , while strangeness neutrality ( near the transition ) implies @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the value of @xmath9 is insensitive ( within the numerical accuracy ) to the value of @xmath19 , while higher orders in the development of @xmath8 depends on @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : syst ] ) , a fact that can explain the slightly larger values of @xmath9 obtained in @xcite and is likely related to the so called roberge - weiss transition , taking place at @xmath20 @xcite . a further confirmation of the @xmath19-independence of @xmath9 is given by the results of @xcite : a value of @xmath9 in very good agreement with the ones of @xcite is obtained by performing simulations directly at strangeness neutrality . the effect on @xmath9 of the isospin breaking constraint @xmath21",
    "was also shown in @xcite to be negligible with the present accuracy .     and @xmath16 .",
    "( right ) results of the fit to extract @xmath9 for different fit ranges ; empty symbols denote the purely quadratic fit , while also the quartic correction is used for the filled symbols ( from @xcite),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   and @xmath16 .",
    "( right ) results of the fit to extract @xmath9 for different fit ranges ; empty symbols denote the purely quadratic fit , while also the quartic correction is used for the filled symbols ( from @xcite),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.5% ]      as a byproduct of the determination of the curvature @xmath9 , the continuum extrapolated chiral susceptibility was obtained in @xcite for several values of the imaginary chemical potential , see fig .",
    "[ fig : crit ] ( left ) .",
    "the dependence on the chemical potential of @xmath12 can give some hints on the location of a critical endpoint : a critical endpoint for @xmath22 would suggest the maximum of @xmath12 to decrease and its half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) to increase as the imaginary chemical potential is increased .",
    "none of these behaviours was however observed in the numerical data , see fig .",
    "[ fig : crit ] ( right ) . while this is obviously not incompatible with the existence of a critical endpoint at @xmath22 , it is an indication that ( if it exists ) it can not be too close to the real axis .",
