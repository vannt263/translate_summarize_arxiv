    "studies of the solar photospheric magnetic field are ideally performed using the full magnetic field vector ; for many scientific investigations which may not require the full vector , it is the radial component @xmath0 which is often desired , as is derivable from vector observations . yet observations of the full magnetic vector are significantly more difficult to obtain , from both instrumentation and data - reduction / analysis points of view , than obtaining maps of solely the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "observations consisting of the line - of - sight component can accurately approximate the radial component only along the sun - earth line , that is where the observing angle @xmath4 , or @xmath5 . away from that line , _",
    "i.e. _ at any non - zero observing angle , the line - of - sight component deviates from the radial component . observing solely the line - of - sight component of the solar photospheric magnetic field implies that the observing angle @xmath6 imposes an additional difficulty in interpreting the observations  it is not simply that the full strength and direction of the magnetic vector is unknown , but the contribution of these unknown quantities to the @xmath1 signal changes with viewing angle . in other words , when @xmath5 , the line - of - sight component @xmath1 is equal to the radial component @xmath0 .",
    "nowhere else is this true .    a common approach to alleviate some of this `` projection effect '' on",
    "the inferred total field strength is to assume that the field vector is radial everywhere ; then by dividing the observed @xmath1 by @xmath2 , an approximation to the radial field may be retrieved .",
    "this is the `` @xmath2-correction '' .",
    "its earliest uses first supported the hypothesis of the overall radial nature of plage and polar fields , and provided a reasonable estimate of polar fields for heliospheric and coronal magnetic modeling @xcite .",
    "however , it was evident from very early studies using longitudinal magnetographs and supporting chromospheric imaging that sunspots were composed of fields which were significantly non - radial , _",
    "i.e. _ inclined with respect to the local normal . this geometry can lead to the notorious introduction of apparent flux imbalance and `` false '' magnetic polarity inversion lines ( see figure  [ fig : projection ] ) when the magnetic vector s inclination relative to the line - of - sight surpasses @xmath7 while the inclination to the local vertical remains less than @xmath7 or _ vice versa _ @xcite .",
    "although this artifact can be cleverly used for some investigations @xcite it generally poses a hindrance to interpreting the inherent solar magnetic structure present .    the inaccuracies which arise from using @xmath1",
    "are generally assumed to be negligible when the observing angle @xmath6 is less than @xmath8 ; if the field is actually radial , the correction is only a @xmath9% error , and introduced false neutral lines generally appear only in the super - penumbral areas . yet",
    "this is a strong assumption , and one known to be inaccurate for many solar magnetic structures .",
    "the estimates of polar radial field strength are especially crucial for global coronal field modeling and solar wind estimations @xcite , but these measurements are exceedingly difficult @xcite .",
    "the gains afforded by using the full magnetic vector include the ability to better estimate the @xmath0 component by way of a coordinate transform of the azimuthally - disambiguated inverted stokes vectors @xcite .",
    "however , although there are instruments now which routinely provide full - disk vector magnetic field data ( such as solis , ; hmi ) , the line - of - sight component @xmath1 remains the least noisy , easiest measurement of basic solar magnetic field properties .",
    "we present here a method of retrieving a different , and in the case of sunspots , demonstrably better , estimate of the radial field boundary , @xmath3 , the radial component of a potential field which is constructed from @xmath1 so as to match to the observed line - of - sight component .",
    "this approach was originally described by and , but is rarely used in the literature .",
    "we demonstrate here its implementation , including in spherical geometry for full - disk data .",
    "the method is described in section  [ sec : method ] , the data used are described in section  [ sec : data ] , and both the planar and spherical results for @xmath3 are evaluated quantitatively for active - region and solar polar areas in section  [ sec : arcomps ] and [ sec : fluxcomps ] . in section  [ sec : rcomps ] we reflect specifically on the different approximations in the context of `` false polarity - inversion lines '' artifacts , and in section  [ sec : successnfailure ] we investigate the reasons behind both regions of success and areas of failure .",
    "approaches to computing the potential field which matches the observed line - of - sight component are outlined here for two geometries , with details given in appendices  [ app : method_planar ] and [ app : method_spherical ] .",
    "when one is focused on a limited part of the sun such that curvature effects are minimal , a planar approach can be used to approximate the radial field ( section [ sec : method_planar ] , appendix  [ app : method_planar ] ) .",
    "the planar approach is fast , and reasonably robust for active - region sized patches ( section [ sec : arcomps ] ) . when the desired radial - field boundary is the full disk , or covers an extended area of the disk , such as the polar area , then the spherical extension of the method is the most appropriate ( section [ sec : method_spherical ] , appendix  [ app : method_spherical ] )",
    "; however , depending on the image size of the input , calculating the radial field in this way can be quite slow .",
    "the line - of - sight component is observed on an image - coordinate planar grid .",
    "we avoid having to interpolate to a regular heliographic grid by performing the analysis using a uniform grid in image coordinates , @xmath10 . restricting the volume of interest to @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and neglecting curvature across the field of view",
    ", the potential field can be written in terms of a scalar potential @xmath14 , with the scalar potential given by @xmath15 } + a_0 z , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the vertical distance above the solar surface .",

    "the values of the coefficients @xmath22 are determined by requiring that the observed line - of - sight component of the field matches the line - of - sight component of the potential field , which results in @xmath23   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\quad + l_x l_y a_{33 } a_0 \\delta_{0j } \\delta_{0k}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 are the elements of the field components transformation matrix given in , and @xmath25 denotes taking the fourier transform of @xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 is determined by the net line - of - sight flux through the field of view .",
    "placing the tangent point at the center of the presented field of view ( corresponding to evaluating the coordinate transformation coefficients and the field components transformation matrix at the longitude and latitude of the center of the field of view ) is the default , producing a boundary labeled @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting radial component estimation is least accurate near the edges , as expected , and as such we also present @xmath29 , for which the tangent point is placed at each pixel presented , the field calculated , and only that pixel s resulting radial field ( for which it acted as the tangent point ) is included .",
    "the potential field in a semi - infinite volume @xmath30 can be written in terms of a scalar potential @xmath31 , given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 . defining the coordinate system such that the line of sight direction corresponds to the polar axis of the expansion results in particularly simple expressions for the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xcite . however , because observations are only available for the near side of the sun , it is necessary to make an assumption about the far side of the sun .",
    "the resulting potential field at the surface @xmath36 is not sensitive to this assumption except close to the limb , so for convenience , let @xmath37 , where the front side of the sun is assumed to lie in the range @xmath38 .    with these conventions ,",
    "the coefficients are determined from @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the radial component of the field is given by @xmath41 when evaluated at @xmath36 , this produces a full - disk radial field boundary designated @xmath42 from which extracted harps and polar sub - regions are analyzed below .",
    "our implementation of this approach uses the fortran 95 shtools library @xcite for computing the associated legendre functions .",
    "the routines in this library are considered accurate up to degrees of @xmath43 . for the results presented here ,",
    "a value of @xmath44 was used , corresponding to a spatial resolution of about 2 mm .",
    "for this study we use solely the vector magnetic field observations from the solar dynamics observatory @xcite helioseismic and magnetic imager @xcite . two sets of data were constructed : a full - disk test and a set of hmi active region patches ( `` harps '' ; , , ) over 5 years . for both , in order to keep comparisons as informative as possible , we construct line - of - sight component data from the vector data by transforming the magnetic vector components into a @xmath1 map : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the inclination of the vector field in the observed plane of the sky coordinate system , as returned from the inversion .",
    "the full - disk data target is 2011.03.06_15:48:00_tai ; this date was chosen due to its extreme b0 angle such that the south pole of the sun is visible , the variety of active regions visible at low @xmath47 observing angle ( away from disk center ) , and the presence of a northern extension of remnant active - region plage .",
    "the hmi.me_720s_fd10 full - disk series was used ; data are available through the jsoc lookdata tool .",
    "because the weaker fields do not generally have their inherent @xmath48 ambiguity resolved in that series and we will be evaluating the @xmath3 method in poleward areas of weaker field , two customizing steps were taken .",
    "first , a custom noise mask was generated ( @xmath49 , rather than the default value of 50 ) .",
    "second a custom disambiguation was performed using the cooling parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xcite ; compared to the default hmi pipeline implementation , these parameters provide smaller tiles over which the potential field is computed to estimate @xmath54 , a smaller `` buffer '' of noisy pixels around well - determined pixels , and slower cooling for the simulated annealing optimization .",
    "disambiguation results were generated for 10 random number seeds .",
    "pixels used for the comparisons shown herein are only those for which both the resulting equivalent of the @xmath55 segment is @xmath5660 and the results from all 10 random number seeds agreed , as well .",
    "this requirement translates to 75.3% of the pixels with @xmath57 and 88.8% of the pixels with @xmath58 being included . in the case of the present data ,",
    "there is a 0.2% chance that the disambiguation solution used results by chance , even in the weak areas ( including the poles ) .    from this full disk magnetogram",
    "the nine identified hmi active region patch ( `` harp '' ) areas are extracted using the keywords @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 from the hmi.mharp_720s series .",
    "two polar regions were also extracted : a `` northern plage area '' , which is an extended remnant field and a `` south pole region '' that encompasses the entire visible polar area .",
    "a context image is shown in figure  [ fig : harps ] , and summary information about each sub - area is given in table  [ table : harps ] , including the wcs coordinates for the two non - harp regions for reproducibility .",
    "also in table  [ table : harps ] are summary data for an additional 22 sub - areas , each @xmath64 pixels in size centered along the midpoints in @xmath65 on the image at a variety of @xmath66 positions .",
    ".extracted area descriptions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     throughout this study , we differentiate between when planar approximations are invoked and when curvature is accounted for by referring to `` @xmath67 '' and `` @xmath0 '' , respectively .",
    "the potential - field approximation is performed three ways , as described in section  [ sec : method ] , above : using a planar approximation from the center - point coordinates @xmath28 of each harp or extracted sub - region , using a planar approximation with each point of the extracted region used as the center point @xmath29 , and using the spherical full - disk approach @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we calculate two common @xmath2-correction approximations for each sub - region : the center point value of @xmath68 used as a tangent point to obtain @xmath69 , and secondly each pixel s @xmath2 value is calculated and applied independently , for @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the spatial location of the pixel .    the second set of data consists of a subset of all harps selected over 5.5 years , selected so as to generally not repeat sampling any particular harp : on days ending with 5 ( 5th , 15th , and 25th ) of all months 2010.05  2015.06 , the first ` good ' ( quality flag is 0 ) harp set at : 48 past each hour on / after 15:48 was used .",
    "harps which were defined but for which there were no active pixels are skipped .",
    "the result is 1,819 extracted harps without regard for size , complexity , or location on the disk .",
    "effectively the hmi.bharp_720s series was used , including the standard pipeline disambiguation .",
    "nwra s database initially began construction prior to the pipeline disambiguation being performed for earlier parts of the mission , thus for some of the data base , the hmi.me_720s_fd10 data were used , the harp regions extracted and the disambiguation performed in - house , matching the implementation performed in the hmi pipeline . all analysis is performed up to @xmath72 from disk center , and only points with significant signal / noise in the relevant components ( @xmath73 relative to the returned uncertainties from the inversion , and propagated accordingly ) are included in the analyses .",
    "for this larger dataset , all calculations are done with a planar approximation .",
    "the `` answer '' is @xmath67 , and the boundary estimates calculated are : @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( which imparts a spherical accounting due to the variation of @xmath2 over the field of view ) , and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath42 are computationally possible but extremely slow , and are not employed for this second dataset .",
    "for the results presented here , the `` golden standard '' is taken to be the radial or normal field as computed from the vector data , and to this quantity we compare results of different approximations of the boundary .",
    "we do caution that @xmath0 data do include the observed @xmath74 component , which is inherently noisier than the @xmath1 component .",
    "additionally we stress that the comparisons are performed against a particular instrument s retrieval of the photospheric magnetic field vector , which may not reflect the true sun as per influences in polarimetric sensitivity , spectral finesse , spatial resolution , _ etc . _      to demonstrate the general resulting trends for each of the radial field approximations , we first present density - histograms of the inferred radial field strengths for two representative sub - regions , noaaar11164 ( harp#393 , figure  [ fig : scat393 ] ) and the south pole region ( figure  [ fig : scatspole ] ) . throughout , we do not indicate the errors for clarity ; a 10% uncertainty in field strength is a fair approximation overall , and a detailed analysis beyond that level is not informative here .    for both harp h393 ( noaaar11164 ) and the south pole area , the initial comparison of @xmath1 to @xmath0 ( panel ( a ) in figures  [ fig : scat393 ] ,  [ fig : scatspole ] ) shows the expected signature of underestimated field strengths overall .",
    "note that for both regions , but especially for the the south pole , there is a strong underestimation of the radial field strength across magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath75 correction ( panel ( b ) in figures  [ fig : scat393 ] ,  [ fig : scatspole ] ; the @xmath76 plot is almost identical and not shown here ) shows improvement by eye for both regions , with distributions systematically deviating less from the @xmath77 line .",
    "however , in the case of the h393 corrections , the stronger - field strengths are often over - corrected , and the opposite - polarity erroneous pixels are exacerbated in their error .",
    "this trend is also true for the south pole area : both an improvement ( especially for stronger - field points ) and the appearance of a distinct erroneous opposite - polarity spur in the @xmath75 results .    in the next panel ( panel ( c ) in figures  [ fig : scat393 ] ,  [ fig : scatspole ] ) , a representative potential - field option , @xmath28 , is shown with regards to @xmath0 ( again , @xmath42 and @xmath29 plots look essentially identical ) ; the weaker field strengths appear to be less - well corrected than the @xmath75 approximation , although the strong - field approximations for the sunspots in h393 are significantly better than the @xmath75 correction .",
    "there appears to be a small number of points for which the opposite polarity is retained but overall the stronger field points ( generally @xmath78 g ) lie close to the @xmath77 line .",
    "there are still significant deviations from the @xmath0 field ; this is expected at some level since a potential - field model is being imposed , and it can not be expected that the solar magnetic fields are in fact potential . additionally , while a non - linear force - free field model may better represent the true field @xcite , there is insufficient information in the @xmath1 boundary with which to construct such a model .",
    "for the south pole region , the strong - field areas are less well corrected than was seen in the @xmath75 plot ( figure  [ fig : scatspole ] , panels c , b respectively ) , but the distinct incorrect - polarity spur visible for @xmath75 is less pronounced in the potential - field - based estimate .    for completeness , and as a check of the algorithm ,",
    "the @xmath1 directly attained from the inversion as @xmath79 where @xmath46 is the inclination of the field vector to the line of sight ( and which constitutes the input to the potential field calculation ) , is compared with the @xmath80 derived from the vector field components from the derived potential field ( panel ( d ) in figures  [ fig : scat393 ] ,  [ fig : scatspole ] ) .",
    "these @xmath1 boundaries match well , indicating that there is little if any systematic bias presented by the potential field calculation when recovering the input boundary .",
    "the recovery is not , however , within machine precision due to the lower than optimal degree to which the spherical potential field is computed ; to reproduce the boundary to machine precision is computationally untenable with this algorithm .",
    "the two examples shown in figures  [ fig : scat393 ] ,  [ fig : scatspole ] represent the two extremes of solar magnetic features to which these approximations would be applied : the south polar region ( expected to sample small , primarily radially - directed concentrations of field ) and a large active region with both plage and sunspots .",
    "the distributions of the other sub - regions appear as hybrids when examined in the same manner , having sometimes stronger fields for which the @xmath2-corrections approaches perform the best ( _ e.g. _ , the northern plage area ) , or having sunspot areas for which there is an incorrect - polarity spur present in the distributions that is exacerbated by some amount in the @xmath2-corrections and mitigated by some amount with the potential - field calculations .    to summarize the performance of these approaches , quantitative metrics of the comparisons between @xmath0 and the different estimations for the sub - regions on 2011.03.06",
    "are presented graphically in figures  [ fig : stats_all ] ,  [ fig : stats_strong ] ,  [ fig : stats_weak ] , for all harp - based sub - regions plus the north and south targets considered , and in figure  [ fig : stats_qs ] for the small quiet - sun extractions .",
    "the metrics considered are : the linear correlation coefficient , the fitted linear regression slope and constant , a mean signed error , a root - mean - square error , and the percentage of pixels that show the incorrect sign relative to @xmath0 .",
    "all well - measured points within each sub - region are considered in figure  [ fig : stats_all ] ( see section  [ sec : data ] ) , and in figures  [ fig : stats_strong ] ,  [ fig : stats_weak ] the results are separated between strong and weaker field areas as well .",
    "what is clear is that there is not , in fact , a single best approach . in some cases , _",
    "e.g. _ for h394 and h407 , by almost all measures the @xmath42 and @xmath28 approaches improve upon @xmath1 and the @xmath2-correction methods .",
    "the latter generally show less bias compared to the uncorrected @xmath1 field , but still have a large random error . the potential - field",
    "based estimates show larger differences for weak field strengths , but less random error . comparing the weak- and strong - field results ,",
    "it is clear that the small correlations and regression slopes in the former are due to the abundance of weak - field points and their low response to the corrections ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scat393 ] _ vs. _ [ fig : scatspole ] ) .",
    "however , there is a general trend that plage- or weaker - field dominated areas , including the two polar areas , are better served ( under this analysis ) by the @xmath2-correction methods , notwithstanding the polarity - sign errors .",
    "this is confirmed as a general trend by the quiet - sun areas ( figure  [ fig : stats_qs ] ) whose underlying structures  like the polar area and plage areas  are likely predominantly radial in hmi data . in contrast , when the sub - areas include or are dominated by sunspots , ( _ e.g. _ , h393 , h394 , h401 , h407 ) , the @xmath42 and @xmath28 perform the best by these metrics . the reasons behind this `` mixed '' message of success is explored further , below .    regarding the quiet - sun patches ,",
    "these are sampled in order to test the dependence of the approximations to @xmath2 only , without the complications of different underlying structure : we assume these comprise similar samples of small primarily radial magnetic structures . indeed in figure",
    "[ fig : stats_qs ] , definitive trends with @xmath2 are seen .",
    "all models improve with increasing @xmath2 by these metrics , and there is no obvious difference in trends between quadrants ( east , north , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "there are outliers , which are likely due to inherent underlying structure .",
    "the @xmath2-correction methods generally better serve these areas , by a small degree in some measures , than the potential - field methods . however , all regions except those with @xmath81 have a higher percentage of points with the incorrect sign than all of the harp regions , except for the south polar area .",
    "the second test is the total magnetic flux of the sub - regions , where the estimates of the magnetic flux are computed as @xmath82 over the acceptable pixels , @xmath83 is the area in mm@xmath84 of each pixel ( thus imparting some spherical accounting for the flux which otherwise uses a planar approximation ) , and @xmath85 or similar as indicated . the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : fluxes ] , both for all well - measured pixels and then for only strong - field ( sunspot ) pixels .",
    "the results for the regions extracted from the full - disk data are considered first .",
    "overall , the total flux estimate using @xmath86 is always the largest , that using @xmath87 is always the smallest , with other approximations in varying order between . as demonstrated in section  [ sec : arcomps ] the behaviors can be quite mixed between strong - field , sunspot areas and plage areas , making the summations over the entire sub - regions ( for the total flux ) difficult to interpret .",
    "what is also clear is that the degree of underestimation of the @xmath1-based flux @xmath87 is a function of @xmath2 , and the flux from the @xmath76 boundaries do well overall at recovering the @xmath86 for the same data .",
    "the fluxes based on potential - field based boundaries also do not completely recover @xmath86 , even when the area under consideration is restricted to the sunspots .",
    "the different implementations of each method do not vary significantly between each other .",
    "further , a close examination of figure  [ fig : fluxes ] as compared to figure  [ fig : scat393 ] shows something slightly confusing : while in figure  [ fig : scat393 ] there are indeed regions of the distribution where @xmath88 and certainly @xmath89 , in figure  [ fig : fluxes ] @xmath90 and indeed @xmath91 always .",
    "the differences decrease with increasing @xmath2 as noted above . but with a non - trivial number of points having @xmath88 ,",
    "why is the total flux consistently larger when computed using @xmath0 ?",
    "the answer is that @xmath0 includes the higher - noise component @xmath74 , whereas any estimation using @xmath1 does not include that higher - noise component .",
    "the impact is much larger in weak - signal areas which dominate the summation for total flux when all points are used ( figure  [ fig : fluxes ] , left ) and the impact is less when only strong - field points are included ( figure  [ fig : fluxes ] , right ) .",
    "this impact of photon noise on @xmath74 and its particular influence on the calculation of @xmath86 _ vs. _ @xmath87 is confirmed using model data with varying amount of photon noise @xcite . as such ,",
    "while in this context we consider @xmath0 the `` answer '' , it is clear that it instead represents solely an observed estimate against which we compare other estimates , and is likely to be an overestimate of the true flux .    the larger harp database is used next to examine the @xmath92 differences for a large number of extracted regions ( figure  [ fig : fluxes_lots ] ) . in this plot ,",
    "the general underestimation of @xmath86 by @xmath87 is present as expected , and varies with @xmath47 ; @xmath93 also underestimates the flux relative to @xmath86 although not as severely , and the consistently larger @xmath86 is now understood , from the comments above regarding the inherent influence of noise .",
    "@xmath94 is actually closer to @xmath86 for much of the range in observing angle , however it is also capable of overestimating the total flux , from relatively modest through large observing angles ; this is a property not generally seen when using the @xmath28 boundary . as such , using @xmath87 results in the largest systematic error , while @xmath94 results in the smallest systematic error , with @xmath93 showing an intermediate systematic error relative to @xmath86 . for the random error , the converse order holds , with @xmath94 resulting in the largest random error , @xmath87 the smallest , with the @xmath93 random error comparable to @xmath87 .",
    "the introduced apparent magnetic polarity changes at the edges of sunspots were very early signatures that inclined structures are prevalent in active regions . for many solar physics investigations",
    ", however , the location of , and character of the magnetic field nearby the magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) is central to the analysis . in particular , what is often of interest are magnetic pils with locally strong gradients in the spatial distribution of the normal field , as an indication of localized very strong electric currents which are associated with subsequent solar flare productivity @xcite .",
    "incorrect neutral lines introduced by projection may mis - identify limb - ward penumbral areas as being strong - gradient regions of interest .",
    "figure  [ fig : h393rcomp ] shows images of the observed @xmath0 field , then the analogous estimates from @xmath1 , @xmath76 and @xmath28 for h393 in detail ; this sunspot group is fairly large , complex , and quite close to the limb .",
    "in particular , areas of strong - gradient neutral lines are highlighted .",
    "one can see that the location of the implied magnetic neutral line does not change at all when simply the @xmath76 correction is applied to the @xmath1 boundary , as expected from a simple scaling factor , but the highlighted areas do change because the magnitude of the gradient increases .",
    "the @xmath28 boundary better replicates the @xmath0 boundary , almost completely removing the introduced polarity lines on the limb - ward sides of the sunspots .",
    "however , it is not perfect : there is a slight decrease in the magnitude of field in the negative - polarity plage area which extends toward the north / east of the active region .",
    "this is in part due to a planar approximation being invoked , but also due to the introduction of inclined fields by the potential field model where the underlying field inferred by hmi is predominantly vertical ( see section  [ sec : successnfailure ] ) .",
    "the recovery of a more - appropriate pil in or near sunspots with polarity errors in weaker fields was seen earlier in the analysis of the `` % points of incorrect sign '' in figs .",
    "[ fig : stats_all][fig : stats_weak ] .",
    "the strong - field regions showed a significant decrease in incorrect - polarity fields when a potential - field - based boundary was used relative to the @xmath2 correction boundaries , but in the weak field areas the results were mixed , leading to a similarly mixed result when all pixels were included .",
    "while it is clear that the location of the magnetic neutral line is better recovered for sunspot areas away from disk center using a potential - field model than is possible using the @xmath1 boundary and a multiplicative factor , it is also clear that there are indeed some solar structures for which the potential - field model does not perform well .",
    "we investigate where the different approximations work well , and where they do not , based on the hypothesis that the @xmath2-correction approach should be exactly correct ( by construction ) for truly radial fields as inferred within the limitations of the instrument in question .",
    "first , it behooves us to recall that the @xmath1 component of a magnetic field vector itself can vary widely for a given magnitude @xmath95 as a function of the observing angle @xmath6 , the _ local _ inclination angle @xmath96 ( relative to the _ local _ normal ) , and the local azimuthal angle @xmath97 .",
    "conventional practices of assuming that errors are within acceptable limits when a target @xmath1 is within , say , @xmath8 of disk center , may be surprisingly misleading when the expected @xmath1 magnitude is so significantly different from the input vector magnitude , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : bl_demo ] .",
    "the impact of the azimuthal angle as well as the inclination angle on the observed @xmath1 explains some of why the @xmath2-correction based estimates of the radial field may impart greater errors than might be expected . in other words , one should expect ( for example ) a 20% introduced uncertainty in the @xmath1 component relative to the inherent field strengths even at @xmath98 simply due to the unknown azimuthal directions of the underlying horizontal component of the field  as contrasted to an estimated 13% error from simply geometric considerations at this observing angle .    to explore more where the different approaches fail , and how",

    "two representations are shown : the absolute magnitude ( figure  [ fig : h3848diffs ] ) and the fractional difference ( figure  [ fig : h3848diffs_norm ] ) ; those points which resulted in an erroneous sign change ( relative to the @xmath67 boundary ) are also indicated .",
    "only points which have a `` good '' disambiguation and have a signal / noise ratio greater than 5.0 are included .",
    "summarizing both plots , for @xmath99 , the @xmath75 approximation is systematically closer to @xmath67 than the @xmath28 results ; this is especially true in plage for the @xmath75 model , which also shows no sign - error points whereas there are a few sign - error points in the @xmath28 model . for @xmath100 , slightly inclined fields ,",
    "the bulk of the points are less different between the two boundaries , however most striking is that the @xmath75 approximation is beginning to show significant differences in the sunspots , whereas the @xmath28 sunspot areas continue to display fairly small errors .",
    "the latter do , however , show a greater number of plage points which have introduced an erroneous polarity difference whereas the @xmath75 shows these errors only at the more extreme @xmath2 values . examining only points within @xmath101 range  significantly inclined but not horizontal  the errors in the spot",
    "become very large in @xmath75 , but stay consistent and small in the @xmath28 boundary .",
    "more points in the former are also of the incorrect sign , including many with quite large field - strength differences .",
    "the @xmath28 boundary in fact performs better for both plage and spots at these larger inclination angles than @xmath75 .",
    "the appropriateness of a @xmath2-correction in the context of vertical fields is shown thus to be true , but surprisingly limited to a very small degree of deviation _ away _ from truly vertical . by 20@xmath102 from vertical , the results are mixed . for more inclined fields ,",
    "the @xmath75 is clearly problematic , particularly in sunspots ( in part due to the ( unknown ) inherent azimuthal angle ) , but also in inclined weak - field areas .",
    "one must note , however , that what are inferred to be weak - field inclined points may be predominantly a product of noise in the vector field data at these larger observing angles .",
    "the @xmath28 boundary is demonstrably better for all inclinations within sunspots , and is susceptible to polarity errors in weak - field areas at all inclinations but at a somewhat more consistent , lower level . in this particular case",
    ", the percentage of plage - area pixels with incorrect sign ( over all inherent inclination angles ) is lower for the @xmath28 boundary than the @xmath75 ( 6.1% _ vs. _ 11% , respectively ) , and the former appears to perform quantitatively better for both plage and spot areas in this example .",
    "a method is developed , based on earlier publications @xcite , and tested here for its ability to produce an estimate of the radial field distribution from line - of - sight magnetic field observations of the solar photosphere .",
    "comparisons were made between the line - of - sight component calculated from the vector - field observations , the inferred radial - directed component from the same , and different implementations of two approaches for estimating the radial component from line - of - sight observations : one approach based on the common `` @xmath2-correction '' and one based on using the radial field component from a potential field constructed so as to match the line - of - sight input .",
    "the potential - field constructs impose , of course , significant assumptions regarding the underlying structure .",
    "the `` @xmath2-correction '' approach imposes a single much stronger assumption : that the underlying field is always directed normal to the local surface .",
    "we find that answering the question of which approach better recovers a target quantity differs according to said target s underlying magnetic field structure as would be inferred by the instrument at hand .",
    "structures which abide by the radial - field assumption are well recovered by `` @xmath2-correction '' approaches .",
    "this may , with caution , be extended to structures whose inherent inclination is up to a few tens of degrees , but with an uncertain worsening error as a function of increasing observing angle .",
    "magnetic structures which would be observed to be inherently more inclined by that instrument are generally poorly served by `` @xmath2-correction '' approaches .",
    "most active regions comprise a mix of structures , and as such making general performance statements is dangerous .",
    "while sunspot field strengths are far better recovered using the potential - field constructs , tests on polar or high - latitude areas that should be primarily plage tell a mixed story : higher field strengths are recovered more reliably using some form of @xmath2-correction , yet results also indicate that a significant subset of the measurements are returned with the incorrect magnetic polarity .",
    "that being said , the total magnetic flux , an extensive quantity that often encompasses all structures within an active region , can be better recovered by @xmath2-correction approaches _ if _ the target is dominated by field which would expected to be inferred as radial by the instrument involved .",
    "@xmath1 images of sunspots often have pronounced `` false '' magnetic polarity inversion lines ; because the @xmath2-correction approaches involve multiplying by a simple scaling factor , they can not relocate incorrect pils and instead enhance incorrect - polarity field strengths .",
    "this is a particular problem when strong - gradient pils need to be identified .",
    "the potential - field approaches can mitigate the false - pil problem ; the impact was demonstrated on a near - limb active region , but pil displacement can occur at any location where @xmath103 .    of course it can be argued that the potential field is not appropriate for magnetically complex active regions , and that linear or non - linear extrapolations would perform even better .",
    "unfortunately , without crucial additional constraints , there is no unique linear or nonlinear force - free field solution to the @xmath1 boundary , whereas the potential field provides a unique solution .",
    "the most general conclusions are first , that any correction improves upon the naive @xmath104 approach .",
    "second , the @xmath2-corrections recover field strengths in areas inherently comprised of vertical structures ( as would be inferred by the instrument ) , but introduce random errors whose magnitude can be surprisingly large given a sunspot s proximity to disk center , and these corrections exacerbate the influence of projection - induced sign errors .",
    "lastly , while the potential - field reconstructions will introduce systematic errors , generally underestimating field strengths and introducing new polarity - sign errors in weaker and more radially - directed fields , it recovers well both the radial - component field strengths in sunspots and the locations of the magnetic polarity inversion lines .",
