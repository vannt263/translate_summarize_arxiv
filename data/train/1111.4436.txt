    "colloidal dispersions are often used as model systems to investigate a variety of phenomena in ( soft ) condensed matter physics , including crystallization , clustering / gelation , and the glass transition.@xcite particles can interact with each other via e.g. excluded volume only,@xcite electrostatic interactions and van der waals attractions.@xcite however , external fields such as gravity and electric and magnetic fields can also influence the phase behavior either directly by changing the interparticle potentials , or indirectly by coupling to the osmotic pressure , or both . due to their mesoscopic sizes",
    ", colloids have been used to study a variety of problems related to many particle statistical mechanics in- and out of equilibrium .",
    "it is experimentally possible to use relatively simple and powerful techniques , such as optical and confocal microscopy @xcite or static and dynamic light scattering @xcite to fully characterize their structural and dynamical properties .",
    "however , because colloids are much larger than atoms ( @xmath0 times larger ) , and the interparticle cohesion is therefore relatively weak , gravity often plays a significant role and affects both the colloidal equilibrium phase behavior , as well as dynamical processes . on the single - particle level",
    "the gravitational length , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the thermal energy and @xmath3 is the buoyant colloid weight ( with @xmath4 the particle diameter , @xmath5 the density mismatch between the particle and the solvent , and @xmath6 the gravitational acceleration ) , characterizes at what heights gravity will start to play an important role in the equilibrium phase behavior .",
    "if the gravitational length is sufficiently larger than the colloidal size the equation of state can be deduced from the density profile in a single sample . for this , the density profile should be measured as a function of height.@xcite recent work has shown that this can be obtained quite effectively from real - space microscopy techniques.@xcite however , care has to be taken in the case of systems with long - range electrostatic interactions between the colloids , as the effect of the double layer complicates this scheme.@xcite the pclet number , @xmath7 , the ratio between the effect of sedimentation against that of brownian diffusion , is another dimensionless quantity that characterizes the influence of gravity , here with its effects on the particle dynamics : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the time scales for brownian diffusion and sedimentation respectively .",
    "when @xmath11 , gravity may be neglected , while in the case @xmath12 the behavior of a colloidal dispersion will be strongly affected by gravity . from this relation ( eq .",
    "[ peclet ] ) , one can appreciate the strong effects of particle size and density on the pclet number as this varies with the fourth power of the particle diameter , @xmath13 , and linearly with the density mismatch , @xmath14 .",
    "for example , for a colloidal particle of 1 @xmath15 m diameter and a density mismatch of @xmath16 g / ml ( @xmath17 m ) , the drift of the particle due to gravity is 10 times larger than that of brownian diffusion . by choosing the right particle size and matching the density of the particles to that of the solvent",
    ", one can significantly reduce the influence of gravity in laboratory experiments .",
    "however , it is experimentally difficult to reduce the density difference @xmath18 significantly below @xmath19 g / ml without extreme temperature control ( better than 0.01 @xmath20c ) required to reach the condition of @xmath15-gravity.@xcite in addition , the gravitational length and pclet number are single particle properties ; clearly , interactions at increased volume fractions can significantly modify the effects of gravity . for instance , when colloids form solid - like structures , such as aggregates or crystallites , the relevant buoyant force is not that of a single particle , but rather that experienced by solid structures composed of many colloids . because of the already mentioned strong size dependence of both the gravitational length and the sedimentation velocity , these collective effects are enormous and can already make the effects of gravity significant for nano - particle dispersions if they solidify",
    "moreover , a sedimenting piece of a colloidal solid , like a crystal or a gel , experiences significant shearing forces of the liquid during its fall , and sets up a convective counter flow as well .",
    "it was only recently realized that such flows can significantly alter the shape of the colloidal crystals formed.@xcite these effects alter the individual particle trajectories and consequently affect the growth mechanism , nucleation process and collective dynamics .",
    "although less severe than in the case of solidification , in the case of attractive interactions in general particles will on average spend more time in a `` clustered state '' than in case of repulsive systems , thus increasing the effects of gravity .",
    "when the attractions are large enough to cause a gas - liquid phase separation , again the newly formed denser phase will quickly start to sediment .",
    "therefore , it is important to gauge the effects of gravity , and to determine when experiments can be considered to be in the limit of _",
    "zero_-gravity , especially for colloidal systems with a gravitational length smaller than the container size .",
    "experiments which compare those performed at @xmath21 with the same experiments done in a microgravity environment are ultimately required to quantify the gravity related phenomena and to investigate the influence of weak forces on physico - chemical processes , such as phase separation and aggregation / gelation .",
    "this question is what drove scientists to perform experiments under micro - gravity conditions in so - called parabolic flights that can be performed by airplanes@xcite , and also in the space shuttle@xcite and the international space station.@xcite the main findings , with a focus on solidification and phase separation , will be briefly reviewed in the following .",
    "although there certainly are important effects of gravity on the formation of colloidal particles as well ( see e.g. vanderhoff _ _ et al.__@xcite ) , these will not be considered here .",
    "a few studies have been performed during the last 15 years to elucidate these effects , going from earth milligravity to space microgravity experiments .",
    "the chaikin and russel groups performed experiments in the space shuttle columbia to study the effects of gravity on the crystallization of colloidal hard spheres.@xcite microgravity experiments performed in the coexistence region ( @xmath22 ) showed a face - centred cubic ( f.c.c . )",
    "structure , suggesting that f.c.c .",
    "is the equilibrium structure for colloidal hard spheres.@xcite this was confirmed by computer simulations.@xcite on the other hand , colloidal crystals grown just above the melting volume fraction ( @xmath23 ) exhibited a random stacking of hexagonally close - packed planes ( r.h.c.p . ) , whereas in normal gravity they showed a mixture of r.h.c.p . and f.c.c .",
    "packings , suggesting that the f.c.c .",
    "component was formed as a result of gravity - induced stresses.@xcite in the same experiments in space , dendritic growth of colloidal crystals was observed .",
    "this kind of crystal growth was inhibited in normal gravity , because the rough dendrites were simply sheared off by the flow caused by the sedimentation of the colloidal crystals . at much higher volume fractions , glassy systems , which failed to crystallize on earth , crystallized fully in less than two weeks in microgravity .",
    "simeonova _ _ et al.__@xcite used real - space fluorescent recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) to study the influence of gravity on the long - time behavior of the mean - square displacements ( msd ) of glassy polydisperse colloidal hard spheres . using two density matching conditions , corresponding to different gravitational lengths : @xmath24 of 0.2 mm ( low gravity effect ) and 13 @xmath15 m ( normal gravity )",
    ", the authors showed that under the effect of normal gravity and for samples prepared at volume fractions higher than @xmath25 , aging takes place over a much wider time window .",
    "that explains the observation that colloidal hard sphere systems which are glassy on earth rapidly crystallize in space .",
    "other experiments were performed to study the effects of gravity on colloidal dispersions .",
    "bailey _ _ et al.__@xcite used small - angle light scattering and direct imaging to study the phase separation in a deeply quenched colloid - polymer mixture in microgravity on the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "the authors followed this process for nearly 5 decades in time , from the early stage of spinodal decomposition , which is governed by diffusion - limited dynamics , to the late stage governed by interfacial - tension - driven coarsening , where the domains reached a centimeter in size .",
    "the phase separation dynamics closely mimic that of molecular fluid mixtures after very shallow quenches through the critical point .",
    "et al.__@xcite studied the aggregation kinetics of polystyrene colloids in space and compared the results with those measured on earth . in microgravity",
    "the clusters grew at a rate in qualitative agreement with that expected for diffusion - limited cluster aggregation ( dlca ) , which persisted for the full duration of the space experiment .",
    "by contrast , the time evolution of the average cluster sizes on earth showed a significant deviation from dlca behavior .",
    "the initial growth of the clusters was identical to that in space , following a power - law time evolution consistent with dlca ; however , after a certain time , the growth deviated from the expected behavior and reached a plateau , with no further growth observed .",
    "et al.__@xcite studied the kinetics of colloidal alloy crystallization in binary mixtures of polystyrene and silica particles having different sizes and densities in microgravity using parabolic flights in an airplane .",
    "the growth rates increased substantially in microgravity up to about 1.7 times those in normal gravity , which was mainly caused by the absence of particle segregation that took place under normal gravity .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite studied the effect of added salt on the crystallization kinetics of silica particles .",
    "the authors found that the rate coefficients decreased as the salt concentration increased and that those in microgravity were smaller than those in normal gravity .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite used atomic force microscopy to study the effect of gravity on the deposition of polystyrene sulfate latex , silica and colloidal gold particles onto solid surfaces .",
    "the results showed that significant differences are observed in the particle deposition onto horizontal and vertical surfaces , under identical suspension conditions and exposure times .",
    "when the density of the colloidal particles is high , as in the case of colloidal gold particles , gravity can become a significant driving force for particle transport to the surface .",
    "as mentioned , only a limited number of experiments can be and have been performed in true microgravity conditions .",
    "it is therefore important to diagnose whether gravity may significantly influence the outcome of a ground - based experiment .",
    "bartlett _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite proposed a simple and elegant way of simulating time - averaged _ zero_-gravity conditions on earth .",
    "the method consists simply of rotating the samples slowly ( with ca . 1 hz ) in the vertical plane at a certain angular velocity , @xmath26 , so the sedimentation of a particle is effectively averaged out over one cycle .",
    "the optimum angular frequency is determined by a balance between the rate of sedimentation and the magnitude of the rotationally induced shear field within a sample .",
    "time scales of other dynamical processes such as phase separation should be taken into account as well .",
    "in fact , @xmath26 must be sufficiently large to ensure that composition gradients at any instant of time are not significant over the diameter of for instance an aggregate .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 must also be sufficiently small to ensure that the rotationally induced shear gradient and/or convection does not significantly distort the equilibrium microstructure . with our experiments we roughly aimed at reducing settling of particles within one rotation to the particle size or less . with this technique , the authors studied binary mixtures of large and small spherical particles , and compared the results with those subjected to normal gravity .",
    "the overall volume fraction of the suspension , @xmath27 was 56.6% with a mixing ratio of ab@xmath28 . under normal gravity , in the top 1 mm of the system an irregularly stacked close - packed crystal of small spheres ( species b ) formed together with an ordered ab@xmath29 alloy structure .",
    "lower down in the sample , the authors observed 15 mm of a single crystalline phase of small spheres , with the large spheres in amorphous structure . at the bottom , the system formed 10 mm of an amorphous structure .",
    "the observation of ab@xmath29 confirmed the importance of gravity in these binary mixtures since equilibrium studies had shown that ab@xmath29 structures are formed only in suspensions with compositions between ab@xmath30 and ab@xmath31.@xcite by contrast , after slowly rotating the sample for 138 days and standing ( @xmath32 ) for 40 hours , the dispersions remained homogeneous and crystallization proceeded throughout the sample with a crystalline phase of small spheres with the remaining , relatively small number of , large spheres in amorphous structures .",
    "amazingly , the methodology of bartlett _",
    "et al_. has not seen that much follow - up work , although it was reinvented at least once in work on the effects of depletion on micron - sized colloidal platelets by badaire _",
    "et al_.@xcite in this paper , we will , mostly qualitatively , study several systems that we feel are representative of many self - assembling systems being studied by many groups .",
    "we investigate the difference between systems left to evolve under the influence of gravity and the same systems for which a slow continuous rotation averaged out the effect of particle sedimentation ( see fig .[rotstage ] ) . ultimately , it is our goal to find out under which conditions the methodology of averaging out gravity will give similar results as true _ zero_-gravity experiments and under which conditions it will not",
    ". although it is not part of the present paper , having a confocal scan head attached to the rotation stage is in principle possible , and may provide single particle level trajectories of the systems that in this paper are studied more qualitatively .",
    "the systems we studied include : a hard sphere fluid , a colloidal crystal of particles interacting via long - range repulsions , an oppositely charged colloidal gel that is crystallizing , a colloidal system with short - range depletion attraction and long - range electrostatic repulsion , dipolar colloidal chains , and colloidal gold platelets with attractive van der waals interactions .",
    "to do so , we prepared identical pairs of samples of these different systems . for each case , the sample was rigorously homogenized on a vortex apparatus and transferred into two glass capillaries .",
    "subsequently , one sample was stored horizontally under normal gravity ( see fig . [ rotstage].c , except in the case of charged colloidal crystal ( ccc ) where the sample was stored verticlally and observed with a tilted confocal microscope ) , whereas the other one was rotated in a home - built rotating stage to average out the effect of particle sedimentation ( see fig .",

    ", we compared the two samples by studying them with confocal microscopy .",
    "[ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < \" , ]     to average out the effects of gravitational sedimentation , we built a rotating stage using the design by badaire _ _ et al.__@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ rotstage].a , b ) that enabled us to rotate samples at rates between 0 and 10 rpm .",
    "this design consists of a sample holder , made from a silicone elastomer , in which several slots were molded to accommodate microscope glass slides , and a peristaltic pump installed in such a way that the sample holder attached to its rotor rotates in a vertical plane .",
    "the fabrication of the stage required 4 main steps : 1 ) a mold was fabricated from a rigid assembly of 28 vertically and uniformly distributed glass slides ( 26 mm long , 1 mm thick ) inserted into the lid of a 145 mm plastic petri dish .",
    "the vertical position of the slides was adjusted such that a gap of approximately 1 mm remained at the bottom of the petri dish after positioning the lid over it .",
    "2 ) a silicone elastomer was prepared by mixing 100 ml of sylgard dc 184 elastomer base and 10 ml of curing agent .",
    "once degassed in a dessicator connected to a vacuum pump , the elastomer was poured into the petri dish , and the lid with the glass slide assembly was placed over it .",
    "3 ) the whole assembly was placed in an oven at 80@xmath20c for 24 h to cure the elastomer .",
    "4 ) once at ambient temperature , the sample holder was separated from the mold with the help of a few drops of ethanol , and screwed to the rotor of an inexpensive peristaltic pump ( variable - flow peristaltic pump , fisher scientific ) , installed on a support in such a way that the sample holder rotates exactly in a vertical plane parallel to gravity .",
    "we also constructed a setup in which it was possible to rotate the samples while simultaneously putting them under the influence of a well defined electric field .",
    "the setup was build from an inexpensive motor and gear assembly and a mercury wetted rotating contact ( mercotac model 305 ) .",
    "the mercury in this `` slip ring '' ensures there is absolutely no contact bounce present in the signal . with this setup an electric signal of 250v with a frequency ranging from dc to 1 mhz",
    "could be applied to the rotating sample .",
    "since the samples in the stage rotate slowly , sedimentation is effectively averaged out and additionally , convection is reduced . however , since the confocal microscope setup is presently not designed for rotation , particle sedimentation could not be averaged out during the observation of the samples .",
    "we believe that the observed structures were not affected by gravity during the short time ( @xmath33 min ) between taking the samples out of the rotation stage and the 3d - imaging .",
    "the different dispersions studied in this work were transferred each into two glass capillaries of @xmath34 mm inner dimensions and approximately @xmath35 cm long ( vitrocom , see fig .",

    "the samples were stored horizontally under the influence of gravity ( except in the case of charged colloidal crystal ( ccc ) where the sample was stored verticlally ) and on the rotating stage for several days .",

    "the stable structure found in both experiments , theory and computer simulations is a string fluid phase that consists of chains of particles parallel to the field direction and with liquid like order perpendicular to the field direction.@xcite         here , we studied the effect of gravity on the string length distribution with a system of electrostatically stabilized silica particles ( @xmath97 , diameter @xmath98 @xmath15 m ) suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide ( @xmath99 nm and @xmath100 ) and subjected to an ac electric field .",

    "( @xmath101 v/@xmath15 m , @xmath102 = 1 mhz the root - mean - square electric field and the frequency respectively ) , the induced dipole moment in each particle led the particles to assemble into strings of one particle thick that were aligned in the field direction in a head - to - tail arrangement with a broad distribution in the length of the chains.@xcite these strings then sedimented when the cell was kept horizontal , due to the density mismatch between the particles ( 2.1 g / ml ) and the solvent ( 1.1 g / ml ) . at the bottom of the cell the local concentration of the strings",
    "slowly increased .",
    "both ends of the longer strings continuously caught particles or small strings moving around them , thus growing into longer strings ( fig.[strings]b ) .",
    "the distance between the individual strings was about 20 - 35@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the dipolar contribution between these strings was unimportant and we did not observe a further change in the string length distribution . on the other hand , a distribution of short strings ( fig.[strings]a ) was maintained homogeneously throughout the dispersion by means of rotating the cell .",
    "our experimental results qualitatively demonstrate that the structure evolution , e.g. string length distribution , becomes quite different when the sedimentation of colloids is averaged out by rotating the sample .",
    "when dispersed in water , highly anisotropic single crystalline gold platelets ( @xmath103 m diameter , @xmath104 nm thick ) can self - assemble into long wormlike columns by finely tuning the interplay between van der waals and electrostatic interactions.@xcite in absence of salt , and in the limit of low volume fraction ( @xmath105 ) , the particles remain isotropically dispersed , but for ionic strengths comprised roughly between 0.8 and 2 mm , the particles form dynamic columns or stacks , the length of which depends on the depth of the secondary van der waals minimum in the pair potential and on the volume fraction .",
    "however , because of the high density mismatch between gold and water , the particles sediment quickly in a stationary capillary and the observed structures are therefore highly influenced by gravity . since , in this system , the main consequence of gravity is an increase of the local particle concentration near the surface , the length of the columns ( at constant ionic strength ) is expected to be longer after the capillary is allowed to stay horizontal for a sufficient amount of time .",
    "we verified this experimentally by comparing qualitatively the column size distribution in a suspension in which the columns were kept homogeneously dispersed throughout the whole volume with the help of the rotating stage and in an identical suspension that was kept horizontal .        the first image ( a ) of fig .  [ gold",
    "] was captured after allowing the capillary to rotate on the stage for 72 hours after preparation ( the image was taken less than 1 min after removing the capillary from the stage ) .",
    "the ionic strength in the suspension was 1.5 mm ( nacl ) .",
    "only short columns were seen .",
    "a gas phase of very short columns and individual particles was present in the whole volume above this first layer of columns because of the very large difference in the gravitational length between individual particles and the stacks of particles .",
    "the second image ( b ) was captured after keeping the same capillary immobile for 24 hours .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the size distribution evolved to much larger lengths , and few short columns or isolated particles were observed .",
    "it was checked qualitatively that the same size distribution was obtained by preparing another capillary and leaving it undisturbed for 72 hours before observation .",
    "in this paper , we studied the effect of particle sedimentation on the structure formation of a whole range of different self - assembling colloidal systems , including a hard sphere fluid , a dispersion with a long debye screening length at a density above the freezing transition , an oppositely charged colloidal gel that is crystallizing , colloids with competing short - rang depletion attraction and long - rang electrostatic repulsion , colloidal dipolar chains , and colloidal gold platelets under conditions in which they organized into equilibrium stacks .",
    "we used a simple home - built rotating stage to average out the effect of particle sedimentation , and compared the results with identical samples that were left under the influence of gravity for the same amount of time .",
    "in addition , we showed how such a setup can also be extended and used in cases were mhz frequency externally applied electric fields are used to manipulate a dispersion . in the case of the repulsive charged colloidal crystal , an unusual transient sequence of dilute - fluid /",
    "dilute - crystal / dense - fluid / dense - crystal phases was observed throughout the suspension under the influence of gravity , which is related to the volume fraction dependence of the interactions between charged particles . in the case of oppositely charged colloids ,",
    "a gel - like structure was found to collapse under the effect of gravity with a few crystalline layers formed on top of the sediment , whereas the gel completely transformed into crystallites with random orientations when sedimentation was averaged out by slowly rotating the sample .",
    "we showed in general that the use of a rotating stage is very useful to diagnose when gravity may significantly influence the outcome of ground - based experiments .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated that it can serve as a cheap and simple method to average out the effects of particle sedimentation for a wide variety of colloidal systems .",
    "further work needs to find the conditions under which this method approaches systems at _ zero_-gravity preferably by comparison with similar experiments under true ( micro ) zero - gravity conditions .",
