    "helical spin systems have being studied for long time .",
    "physics of these systems is fascinating and sometimes is very much different from that of collinear spin systems .",
    "the noncollinear spin systems manifest quite unusual temperature - driven phase transitions and critical properties ,  @xcite for a review see ref .  .",
    "excitation spectra ( magnons ) in noncollinear systems are also very different from that in collinear magnets , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "generically there are two ways to generate a noncollinear spin structure , spin frustration and dzyaloshinsky - moriya spin orbit interaction . in the present paper",
    "we consider only the spin - frustration mechanism .",
    "it is worth to note that the dzyaloshinsky - moriya mechanism leads to interesting quantum field theories ,  @xcite but this is outside of the scope of the present work .",
    "the usual field theory approach to a spin helix induced by spin frustration is based on the following representation of the spin @xmath1 , see ref .",
    "@xmath2 here @xmath3 is the wave vector of the spin spiral and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the dynamic fields .",
    "the nonlinear ginzburg - landau action describing temperature - induced phase transitions is written in terms of the fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 , see review .",
    "@xcite typically a frustration implies that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the lattice spacing .",
    "typical momenta , that appear in fluctuations of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 fields , are much smaller than @xmath3 , and hence @xmath3 is not influenced by the fluctuations .",
    "sometimes , due to accidental fine tuning of parameters , the wave vector of the spin spiral is small , @xmath10 , i.e. the system is close to a collinear ferromagnet .",
    "this happens in fesro@xmath0 and fecao@xmath0 compounds .",
    "@xcite in this case typical momenta of fluctuations are comparable with @xmath11 , and hence the standard approach  @xcite based on the ginzburg - landau action for @xmath6 and @xmath7 is not valid .",
    "another example is the case of @xmath12 close to the vector of antiferromagnetic ordering . on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice",
    "this means @xmath13 .",
    "this is the `` antiferromagnetic spin spiral '' realised in cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite in this case @xmath12 is small because of the small doping @xmath14 , and hence , once more , the approach based on eq.([s ] ) is not applicable .",
    "there is one more important difference of the field theories considered in the present paper from the case ( [ s ] ) .",
    "this difference concerns a direction of @xmath12 . in the cases we consider ,",
    "the vector @xmath12 , in spite of being small , is always correlated with lattice directions .",
    "for example for a square lattice it can be directed only along a diagonal or along a side of the square .",
    "this implies an essential correlation between the short range dynamics , @xmath15 , and the long range dynamics , @xmath16 .",
    "hence , this also implies that o(3 ) and so(3 ) nonlinear @xmath17-models can not be applied for these situations .    in the present paper we consider effective quantum field theories for helical spin magnets close to antiferromagnets and to ferromagnets .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "section ii reminds the reader the logic of derivations of the effective action for collinear antiferromagnets and ferromagnets . in section iii",
    "we consider the `` antiferromagnetic spin spiral '' and demonstrate that the `` hourglass '' spin - wave dispersion observed in neutron scattering from cuprates is a fingerprint of such state . in section iv we consider the `` ferromagnetic spin spiral '' and show that quantum fluctuations influence qualitative features of the spin - wave dispersion .",
    "section v presents our conclusions .",
    "to derive the effective action for a collinear isotropic _ antiferromagnet _ ( af ) one can use the following heuristic arguments .",
    "( i ) the staggered magnetization is described by a unit vector @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "( ii ) the elastic energy is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "( iii ) the larmor theorem : if there is a state of the system without magnetic field , then the same state in a uniform magnetic field @xmath21 must precess with frequency @xmath22 .",
    ", @xmath23 is the g - factor , and @xmath24 is bohr magneton . ]",
    "( iv ) the static energy can depend on the magnetic field only quadratically because the system has no net magnetization .",
    "in other words , @xmath18 is not a vector , it is an axis .",
    "the only lagrangian that satisfies the above requirements is the lagrangian of the nonlinear @xmath17-model @xmath25\\right)^2- \\frac{\\rho_s}{2}\\left({\\bm \\nabla}{\\vec n}\\right)^2 \\ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficients are the perpendicular magnetic susceptibility @xmath26 and the spin stiffness @xmath27 .    to derive the effective action for a collinear _ ferromagnet",

    "( ii ) the elastic energy is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "( iii ) the larmor theorem : if there is a state of the system without magnetic field , then the same state in a uniform magnetic field @xmath21 must precess with frequency @xmath22 .",
    "( iv ) the static energy depends on the magnetic field linearly because @xmath18 is true magnetization .",
    "the only lagrangian that satisfies the above requirements reads @xmath28 here @xmath29 is spin of the ferromagnet and @xmath30 is a cp@xmath31 two - component spinor .",
    "the field @xmath32 is a bosonic field , we just use the cp@xmath31 representation for the field .",
    "note that the difference between antiferro and ferro is only in the point ( iv ) : quadratic or linear dependence of energy on an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "it is worth reminding that lagrangians and fields in a quantum filed theory always depend on normalization point . throughout the paper we use normalization at zero momentum ( infinite distance )",
    "this implies that in the ground state the normalization is @xmath33 .",
    "this also implies that spin stiffnesses and the magnetic susceptibility in ( [ lls ] ) and ( [ llf ] ) are renormalized parameters that include all quantum fluctuations .",
    "these are not bare parameters .    in subsequent sections",
    "we derive and analyse effective actions that describe spin spiral states close to antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases .",
    "this means that the wave vector of the corresponding spiral is small compared to the inverse lattice spacing .",
    "specifically we have in mind cuprates for the af case and fecao@xmath0 for the ferro case .",
    "here we consider the 2d case ( 2d + time ) , the 3d generalization is straightforward .",
    "the effective action for the spin spiral state in the generalized @xmath34 model has been derived in ref .  .",
    "the action is written in terms of the bosonic field @xmath18 , describing staggered spins of the parent mott insulator , and the fermionic field @xmath35 describing mobile holons .",
    "the spinor @xmath35 describes pseudospin of the holon , the pseudospin originates from two af sublattices .",

    "the second line represents time derivatives of fermionic fields .",
    "the first term in the third line is the kinetic energy of fermions , @xmath38 is the inverse mass , the second term in the third line was derived long time ago by shraiman and siggia .",
    "@xcite the last line represents the interaction of the pseudospin @xmath39 with an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "@xcite the unit vectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 are directed along the corresponding diagonal of the square lattice . the original t - j model is gauge invariant . therefore the effective action ( [ eq : ll ] ) is also gauge invariant and this is reflected in covariant derivatives @xmath42 \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\bm d}={\\bm \\nabla } + \\frac{i}{2}{\\vec \\sigma}\\cdot[{\\vec n}\\times{\\bm \\nabla}{\\vec n } ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] acting on the fermionic field .",

    ". therefore we will truncate fermionic degrees of freedom in ( [ eq : ll ] ) throwing away all physical effects except of the spin spiral .",
    "we retain only spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom responsible for the spin spiral .",

    "importantly , the truncated lagrangian ( [ afs ] ) still respects the gauge invariance of the original t - j model since it contains only covariant derivatives acting on the pseudospin , @xmath49 is defined in eq.([long ] ) , and the spacial derivative is defined as @xmath50 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a related important point is that ( [ afs ] ) respects also the larmor theorem .",
    "if there is a state without magnetic field that satisfies equations of motion , then in a magnetic field this state precesses with frequency @xmath22 .",
    "this is a sort of a global ward identity .",
    "it is worth noting that statuses of the lagrangians ( [ eq : ll ] ) and ( [ afs ] ) are different .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : ll ] ) has been derived from the generalized t - j model in a controlled way  @xcite .",
    "the small parameter that controls accuracy of the derivation is small doping . on the other hand",
    "we obtain the lagrangian ( [ afs ] ) from ( [ eq : ll ] ) by an uncontrolled truncation of fermionic degrees of freedom . as a result",
    "we get an effective ginzburg - landau action ( [ afs ] ) that contains only spin @xmath18 and pseudospin @xmath32 . in the present paper",
    "we analyze only the action ( [ afs ] ) which , as we show below , describes experimental observations remarkably well .",

    "we will show that in the limit @xmath54 our approach results in two independent goldstone modes with linear dispersions .",
    "hence , as one should expect , in this limit both approaches are equivalent .",
    "hereafter we set the external magnetic field equal to zero , @xmath55 . neglecting quantum fluctuations",
    "one can easily find the ground state of the lagrangian ( [ afs ] ) , @xmath56 here we choose x- and y - directions in the spin space to lie in the plane of the spin spiral .",
