    "for slightly over a decade , there has been a growing branch of string theory research that extracts important physics of strongly coupled systems by computing with a weakly coupled gravitational `` dual '' system .",
    "these `` gauge / gravity '' dualities termed thus since the strongly coupled system is a gauge field theory or generalization thereof are said to be holographic in nature , since the dual gravitational system crucially has at least one extra dimension , and much of the field theory s properties can be extracted by working on the boundary of the gravitating spacetime .",
    "the best understood version of this is the ads / cft correspondence@xcite between superstring theory on ads@xmath3(4 + 1 dimensional anti  de - sitter times a five  sphere ) and 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath4 supersymmetric @xmath5 yang  mills theory .",
    "the theory can be reduced on the @xmath6 to a gravity theory coupled to a family of fields in the ads@xmath7 .",
    "the boundary of ads@xmath7 is a copy of 3 + 1 dimensional minkowski space , and this is the spacetime where the dual yang  mills theory resides .",
    "its t hooft coupling , @xmath8 , is large in the regime where the dual gravity model is reliable : the large  @xmath9 limit and weak string coupling @xmath10 .",
    "the asymptotic values of the ads@xmath7 fields supply information about operators in the yang  mills theory .",
    "ref.@xcite reviews of much of this technology , with bibliography .",
    "this type of duality has supplied a wealth of information about various strongly coupled systems that can be supplied with a gravitational ( or fully stringy ) dual along these lines .",
    "it has several potentially important applications , ranging from models of the behaviour of the strongly coupled dynamics of quark  gluon plasmas in nuclear physics , to models relevant to condensed matter physics , all of considerable experimental interest .",
    "( see refs.@xcite for reviews and bibliography . )    a holographic model of some of the key phenomenological attributes of superconductivity in 2 + 1 dimensions was proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dual is a simple model of gravity in four dimensions ( ads@xmath11 ) coupled to a @xmath12 gauge field and a minimally coupled charged complex scalar @xmath13 with potential @xmath14 , where the cosmological constant defines the scale @xmath15 _ via _ @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gravitational coupling and our signature is @xmath19 .",
    "we will use coordinates @xmath20 for much of our discussion , with @xmath21 time , @xmath22 forming a plane , and @xmath23 a `` radial '' coordinate for our asymptotically ads@xmath11 spacetimes such that @xmath24 is the boundary at infinity . note that the mass of the scalar @xmath25 is above the breitenlohner ",

    "the asymptotic value of @xmath13 on the boundary sets the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a charged operator  @xmath30 in the system , which is the order parameter . for @xmath31 , the scalar ( and hence @xmath32 ) is zero , and for @xmath33 it is non  zero . in the gravitational theory ,",
    "the high @xmath0 phase is simply the charged black hole ( reissner  nordstrm , or ads ",

    "@xmath0 also depends on @xmath37 .",
    "in fact @xmath38 decreases with @xmath0 until at  @xmath39 it goes below @xmath40 , becoming tachyonic .",
    "the theory seeks a new solution , in which the black hole is no longer ads  rn , but one that has a non  trivial profile for  @xmath13 ( _ i.e. _ , it has `` scalar hair ''  for a discussion of violations of non  hair theorems in this context , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath12 is broken by @xmath41 .",
    "these solutions can be found by solving equations of motion in certain limits ( explored below ) , and the transport properties of the low temperature phase were examined in refs.@xcite , using linear response theory , with the result that the dc conductivity diverges in a way consistent with expectations that the phase is superconducting .",
    "( strictly speaking , the @xmath12 that was broken by @xmath41 is global on the boundary , but it can be gauged in a number of ways without affecting the conclusions . see _",
    "e.g. _ ref.@xcite . )",
    "it is clearly of interest to study this system further , since it could well open the door to a whole new phenomenology of superconductivity in a wide range of physical systems .",
    "we report here on our study of the system in an external magnetic field , continuing the work we began in ref.@xcite .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath1 ( which fills the two dimensions of the superconducting theory ) , also contributes to @xmath42 , _ via _ its square , but contributes with _ opposite sign _ to the electric contribution of the background .",
    "it therefore lowers the temperature @xmath39 at which @xmath38 falls below @xmath43 , triggering the phase transition . on these grounds alone",
    "one then expects a critical line in the @xmath44 plane of a form like that of a full curve from fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_unite ] , but it is important to determine exactly what physics lies on either side of the line .",
    "generically , for non  zero @xmath1 , it is inconsistent to have non  trivial spatially independent solutions on the boundary , and we study two classes of localized solutions in some detail .",
    "the first is a `` droplet '' solution , the prototype of which was found in our earlier work@xcite as a strip in 2d ( straightforwardly generalized to circular symmetry in ref.@xcite ) , and the second is a vortex solution , with integer winding number @xmath45 , which is entirely new .",
    "we obtain these as full solutions of the maxwell  scalar sector in a limit , and their properties allow us to determine key features of the @xmath44 phase diagram ( correcting statements made in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this section reviews the spatially independent condensate solution of ref.@xcite that corresponds to the superconducting ( symmetry breaking ) phase below some @xmath39 .",
    "it is found in a certain decoupling limit . under a redefinition @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the maxwell  scalar part of the action  ( [ eqt : em_action ] )",
    "gets a prefactor of @xmath48 , and the @xmath49 disappears from the @xmath50 coupling .",
    "this means that in the limit @xmath51 , this sector decouples from gravity .",
    "we can therefore take as background black hole the ( planar ) schwarzschild solution : @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "it has an horizon at @xmath54 , temperature @xmath55 , and mass density @xmath56 .",
    "let us write our complex scalar as @xmath57 and write @xmath58 .",

    "near the boundary @xmath63 we have , for constants @xmath64 : @xmath65 @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) sets the vev of a @xmath68 operator @xmath69 @xcite . only one of these vevs can be non  zero at a time , and we will choose to study the case of @xmath70 , for brevity .",
    "@xmath71 sets a chemical potential , and @xmath37 sets a charge density for the @xmath12 symmetry that we are studying here . to find a full solution of the equations",

    "this feeds into the behaviour of all the other fields near @xmath86 , and determining this near the horizon is important in order to seed the numerical search in a manner that will carefully find solutions .",

    "the current density and magnetic field are read off _ via _ the @xmath96 asymptotic @xmath97 , with @xmath98 .",
    "the constant @xmath99 appears in the small  @xmath100 expansion of the function @xmath101 defined by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 at the horizon .",
    "we see that the magnetic field fills the plane , asymptoting to a constant value at @xmath104 , and approaching a non  zero value in the core .",
    "we studied several solutions for a range of @xmath0 and @xmath105 , noticing that for high temperatures @xmath1 is decreased somewhat in the core as compared to the asymptotic value , while for low temperatures @xmath1 is enhanced there .",
    "it is important to determine exactly where in the @xmath44 plane these solutions can appear .",
    "we find our full solutions at a variety of values of @xmath1 , but none below certain values of @xmath1 , which is suggestive .",
    "to determine if there is a minimum value of @xmath1 to form droplets , we can use the probe limit , where @xmath106 is small . here",
    "we can take @xmath107 ( which will determine the magnetic field in this limit ) and have @xmath108 .",

    ", we can carry out the probe computation again , but not in the @xmath51 limit . since the maxwell sector is not decoupled from the geometry for finite @xmath49 we use as background a dyonic black hole .",

    "the metric is of the form given in eqn .",
    "( [ schwarzschild ] ) , but with a maxwell field @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "now , @xmath0 and  @xmath37 are determined by the background ( we do not display them here ) .",
    "we note that the equations of motion have a separable solution @xmath116 , and @xmath117 satisfies an equation of the same form as  ( [ hermite ] ) , but with @xmath118 , giving the gaussian profile .",
    "we can then solve for @xmath119 numerically using the same shooting techniques as before .",
    "this gives a complete @xmath44 curve for a given  @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , these curves connect to the @xmath51 probe computation of above , as can be established by careful comparison of the different definitions of the temperatures and charge densities in the two limits .",

    "[ fig : vortex_solution ] ( for @xmath94 and  @xmath95 ) .",
    "as noted before , there is one unit of winding , and the scalar field runs to a constant at infinity .",
    "so does the charge density , and so we are able to read off the value of the temperature for these solutions .",
    "the magnetic field drops to zero at large @xmath100 , and @xmath92 becomes constant there . that constant is @xmath85 in general , as is consistent with the total magnetic flux being quantized to @xmath121 .",
    "the current density @xmath122 ( not displayed for brevity ) is zero asymptotically and peaks in a ring around the core , supporting the magnetic field , as expected for a vortex .",
    "as for the droplets , the question arises as to where in the @xmath44 plane vortices appear .",
    "as mentioned , we determine @xmath113 from the large  @xmath100 values of @xmath37 and @xmath123 , while the magnetic field is localized in the core . for an applied @xmath1 at some @xmath113",
    ", we expect that the system creates vortices to trap the flux in their cores , forming a lattice of them that increases in density with @xmath1 .",
    "vortices presumably repel each other , and so such a lattice will cost energy .",
    "therefore at some critical @xmath124 the system will seek a lower energy phase , possibly returning to the normal phase .",
    "we do not know if this critical line coincides with the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_unite ] where the droplets begin , although it is the simplest possibility .",
    "we have studied the prototype holographic superconductor of ref.@xcite in the presence of magnetic field , continuing our earlier work@xcite , examining two important classes of solution , the droplet and the vortex .",
    "the latter is completely new , and this is the first time the droplet has been fully constructed .",
    "our analysis in various connected limits shows where these solutions can exist in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "there is a critical line below which droplets are not found , while vortices can be found there .",
    "our interpretation is that this region is the superconducting phase , and that for non ",
    "zero @xmath1 , the vortices develop , trapping the magnetic flux into filaments , as is familiar in type  ii superconductors . above the critical line , the system leaves the superconducting phase , and either forms droplets of condensate or simply reverts to the normal phase ( dual to a dyonic black hole with zero scalar everywhere , which may well yield lower action than the droplets if we had back  reacting solutions to work with ) .",
    "we have performed a stability analysis of these solutions@xcite .",
    "both classes are stable for the examples and modes that we study ( this is expected for the vortices given their conserved winding ) . finally , note that we disagree with the suggestion made in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors find the critical line , but state ( similarly to our ref.@xcite ) that the droplets exist _ below _ the line , and are superconducting . as they did not have the full droplet solutions , nor the vortex solutions , their analyses are not sufficient to make these determinations .",
