    "reaction - diffusion systems are ubiquitous in biology , chemistry and physics . an important class of such systems , diffusion - controlled processes in which a reaction happens whenever two reactants `` meet '' , has been studied for almost a century ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "mathematically , these processes are strongly interacting infinite particle systems , so it is not surprising that many basic questions remain unanswered . here",
    "we analyze a few basic diffusion - controlled processes focusing on the interplay between reaction and spatial inhomogeneity of the initial setting .",
    "we will see that for an extreme inhomogeneous initial configuration with an empty half - line ( [ fig : ill ] ) , the statistics of the occupation number of this half - line is asymptotically stationary and highly non - trivial .",
    "we study three diffusion - controlled reaction systems .",
    "one is a single - species annihilation which is represented by the reaction scheme @xmath4 identical particles ( denoted by @xmath5 ) undergo diffusion and whenever two particles touch each other , they disappear .",
    "strict annihilation is rare .",
    "one example is the annihilation of domain walls in an ising spin chain subjected to a zero - temperature spin - flip dynamics @xcite . in most situations",
    ", however , annihilation merely implies that the reaction product does not further affect the reaction process .",
    "for instance , a collision between two atoms may lead to the formation of a diatomic molecule ; if such molecules are stable ( that is , they do not break back into atoms ) and if they do not influence diffusing atoms , we can use the reaction scheme .    another simple diffusion - controlled process , coalescence , can be represented by the reaction scheme @xmath6 strict coalescence is also rare .",
    "it occurs for example in a potts chain with infinitely many states evolving according to the non - conserved zero - temperature dynamics @xcite . in most situations ,",
    "the coalescence process is a coarse - grained description of the aggregation process @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents clusters of mass @xmath9 , i.e. , clusters composed of @xmath9 monomers .",
    "the symbolic representation indicates that we disregard the mass of aggregates and hence it faithfully describes the gross features of the aggregation process when the diffusion constant is mass - independent and when the size is also mass - independent .",
    "little is known about evolution of irreversible reactions starting from spatially inhomogeneous configurations .",
    "here we consider the simplest situation when at time @xmath10 the half space @xmath11 is uniformly filled by particles , while the half space @xmath12 is empty ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ill ] ) @xmath13 this step - function initial condition has been used e.g. to study front propagation in reaction - diffusion processes @xcite and shock waves in driven exclusion processes @xcite , it is also popular in experimental @xcite and theoretical ( see e.g. @xcite ) studies of cold quantum gases , and in analyses of quantum spin chains ( @xcite and references therein ) .    in three dimensions",
    ", one can use the rate equation approach to analyze the evolution . for annihilation and coalescence processes ,",
    "the density @xmath14 satisfies the reaction - diffusion equation , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath17 the reaction rate .",
    "the long time behavior is simple , viz . in the scaling limit @xmath18 .",
    "the scaled density @xmath19 satisfies an ordinary differential equation which can be solved numerically .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the one - dimensional case .",
    "this is the most challenging setting and the emergent results are richer than in higher dimensions .",
    "the challenge stems from the fact that in one dimension one can not employ the rate equation approach , i.e. , one can not rely on reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "the behaviors are still well understood when the initial conditions are homogeneous , e.g. , @xmath20 , see e.g. @xcite . for the inhomogeneous initial condition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ill ] ) the density eventually decays in the same manner everywhere .",
    "however , particles infiltrate only up to distance @xmath21 into the vacant half - line , so the total _ number _ of particles in the initially vacant half - line is expected to be finite and governed by a stationary distribution . in this paper , we establish this behavior analytically .    for the inhomogeneous setting , the scaling form @xmath22 is anticipated .",
    "we shall obtain the scaled density profile @xmath19 analytically .",
    "an immediate consequence of is that the average total number of particles @xmath23 in the initially empty half - line is _",
    "finite_. more precisely , for the coalescence process @xmath24 for the annihilation process",
    ", the value is twice smaller .",
    "thus the total number of particles @xmath0 in the initially empty half - line is a fluctuating quantity with a finite average .",
    "( the total number of particles in the initially filled half - line is of course infinite , although the density vanishes algebraically with time @xmath25 . )",
    "furthermore , we also find that the total number of particles @xmath0 is governed by a stationary probability distribution @xmath2 .    the determination @xmath26 for the coalescence process is technically challenging .",
    "in addition to @xmath27 which can be established on the basis of symmetry alone , we are able to compute the probability @xmath28 \\nonumber\\\\                       & = & 0.466095976\\ldots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to have exactly one particle in the initially empty half - line . with much more effort it could be possible to determine @xmath29 , but to find the entire distribution @xmath26 requires more advanced methods .    for the annihilation process",
    "we havent been able even to determine @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the coalescence process is more tractable than the annihilation process .",
    "this subtle difference between these two very similar diffusion - controlled reaction processes was already encountered in the homogeneous setting .",
    "for instance , for the coalescence process the distance distribution between adjacent particles is well - known ( see @xcite ) , while for the annihilation process the distance distribution has not been determined analytically @xcite .",
    "another long - standing unresolved problem is to determine the long - time behavior of an impurity ( a particle with diffusion coefficient generally different from the diffusion coefficient of the host particles ) in the annihilation process @xcite .",
    "the annihilation process with the step - function initial condition was investigated in ref .",
    "that study was focused on the survival probabilities @xmath31 , where @xmath32 labels particles according to their initial locations : @xmath33 etc .",

    "an elegant exact treatment of this strongly interacting infinite particle system is possible through the empty interval technique @xcite .    to explain the empty interval technique ,",
