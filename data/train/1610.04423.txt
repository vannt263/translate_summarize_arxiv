    "binary stars cover a very wide range of separations , from a few stellar radii to thousands of astronomical units .",
    "the binaries with orbital period comparable to a human lifetime are detected from variations of quantities such as the radial velocity or the position of the components , but the wide binaries ( wbs ) are more hazardous to identify .",
    "both components look like single stars with constant velocities , and statistical criteria are used to infer whether they can be bounded by gravitation .",
    "the origin of wbs is still debated , since they ca nt be obtained from the simple fragmentation of a collapsing cloud of gas and dust .",
    "other processes were proposed , as gravitational perturbations from passing stars and giant molecular clouds @xcite , star cluster dissolution @xcite or dynamical evolution of triple systems @xcite .",
    "this motivates investigations about the statistical properties of these systems , which are assumed to contain the signature of their formation ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the components of wbs are not all single stars , but some of them are binaries with closer separation .",
    "the properties of the multiple systems , and the possible correlation between the parameters of the wbs and those of the inner binaries , are also clues to understand the origin of these objects .",
    "in addition to researches mentioned in @xcite , these questions were investigated recently by @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "they estimated that the frequency of inner binaries is the same among the primary and among the secondary components of the wbs , but that the frequency of quadruple systems is too large to assume that the presence of inner binaries is not correlated .",
    "if this is confirmed , the formation of the inner binaries could results from the environment where the wb was formed .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new sample of wbs to derive their statistical properties .",
    "since the number of optical stars is growing as the square of the apparent separations , the selection of physical wbs is based on more parameters .",
    "one of us ( * ? ? ?",
    "* h86 hereafter ) used the proper motion to select 439 common proper motion ( cpm ) pairs from the reduction of the second and of the third astronomischen gesellschaft katalog ( agk2/3 ) by @xcite .",
    "these wide pairs were listed in two tables , according to the time @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the apparent separation and @xmath2 the proper motion .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 is the time it takes for the proper motion to displace the components over a distance equal to their separation .",
    "the first table contained 326 pairs of stars with @xmath4  years , and the second one contained 113 pairs with @xmath3 between 1000 and 3500 years . to avoid any confusion between the tables in h86 and those in the present article , the tables",
    "i and ii of h86 are called , respectively , `` list  1 '' and `` list  2 '' hereafter .",
    "the rate of optical pairs was estimated around 1  % in list  1 , and 40  % in list  2 .",
    "an observational programme was initiated in 1986 in order to measure the radial velocities ( rvs ) of the stars , and to select the physical binaries .",
    "however , several wbs are in fact multiple systems including close binaries ( cbs ) , and the rvs of 66 stars from the two lists appeared to be variable , or possibly variable .",
    "these 66 stars were observed over about 20 years , leading to the derivation of the orbital elements of 52 short - period spectroscopic binaries ( sbs ) , and the confirmation of periods of a few decades for 11 other stars .",
    "the status of the 3 remaining stars is uncertain , and the variability of their rv is questionable .",
    "these results were published in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i hereafter ) .",
    "the present paper is the continuation of paper i. it is organized as follows : the observation programme and the mean rvs of the component stars are presented in section  [ sec : rv ] .",
    "the selection of the physical binaries is in section  [ sec : coravelwb ] .",
    "a bias - controlled sample of wbs with unevolved components is presented in section  [ sec : bcmswb ] .",
    "this sample is used to derived the frequency of wbs in section  [ sec : stat ] .",
    "some properties of the multiple systems are investigated in section  [ sec : multi ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "the observational programme was detailed in paper i. in summary , we used the spectrovelocimeter coravel ( for correlation radial velocities , * ? ? ? * ) , that was installed on the swiss 1-m telescope at the observatory of haute - provence ( ohp ) until its decommissioning in 2000 .",
    "our list of targets contained 266 stars from the two lists of h86 .",
    "since the probability to be physical is much larger for a pair in list  1 than in list  2 , only 90 targets were chosen among the 326 pairs of list  1 : the systems with @xmath3 shorter than 350 years were discarded , since the expected number of optical systems among them is only 0.5 , leading to a frequency of 0.2  % ; we discard also the pairs with both components fainter than the completeness limit of the agk2/3 , which is @xmath5  mag . in the same time",
    ", the 113 pairs in list  2 provided 176 targets . due to the limitations of coravel , these stars are generally as late as or later than f5 , but a few am - type stars were also observed .",
    "the precision of coravel was around 0.3 km  s@xmath6 for slow rotators with spectral types around k0 , but around 1 km  s@xmath6 for am stars .",
    "the detection of the sbs was based on the @xmath7 test at the 1 percent threshold .",
    "the measurements of the 66 stars suspected to be variable were presented in paper i. the 200 remaining received a total of 1473 rv measurements , but the number of measurements is not the same for every stars : 3 early - type stars were observed only once , and another one received only 2 measurements . at the opposite ,",
    "the rv of 52 stars was obtained at least 10 times , usually because the other component of the pair had a variable rv . among the 200 stars not discussed in paper i ,",
    "98 were observed at least 5 times .",
    "the median time - span of the observations is 1720 days .",
    "we need the minimum separation still allowing complete detection of the components .",
    "we consider the 780 pairs with @xmath8  years selected in the course of the preparation of h86 .",
    "the distribution of these pairs according to the apparent separation and the photographic magnitude of the primary component is presented in table  [ tab : rho - mpg ] . each count , @xmath9 is followed with its rate , @xmath10 , defined as the ratio :      where @xmath12 is the index of the rows from the top of the table until @xmath13 included . for a given separation ,",
    "it is easier to detect a companion when the primary is faint than when it is bright .",
    "therefore , the table is presented with rows in increasing order from the faintest until the brightest magnitudes .",
    "we read each row from right to left : as long as the separation is larger than the detection limit , the rate @xmath10 is expected to be constant ( the variations are only due to poisson noise ) ; when the detection is not complete , @xmath10 is decreasing .",
    "we infer from table  [ tab : rho - mpg ] that the radius of the image of each star , in arcseconds , is a bit less than that given by the following formula :"
