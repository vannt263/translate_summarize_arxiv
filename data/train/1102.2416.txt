    "graphene can be considered as one of the most splendid functional materials .",
    "this has been proved by the quick science respond to the novel fascinating experiments performed by a. k. geim and k. s. novoselov @xcite .",
    "graphene represents a single layer of @xmath0-bonded carbon atoms , which are densely packed in form of a benzene ring structure .",
    "this ideal planar structure has been used to describe properties of many carbon - based materials including graphite ( that can be viewed as a large number of superposed graphene sheets ) .",
    "this new , strictly two - dimensional material displays unusual electronic properties arising from the bi - conically shaped form of the fermi surfaces near the brillouin zone corners ( dirac points ) . in a quite wide range of energy , electrons and holes propagate as massless fermions and their behavior reproduces the physics of quantum electrodynamics but at the much smaller energy scale of the solid state physics .",
    "for example , a typical superconductivity phenomenon , like the josephson effect , have analogs in the p - n junction . in @xcite",
    "the particle transport trough an interface between a normal and a supercoductor material ( n - s ) is compared with the analogous inter - band tunneling in a p - n graphene junction .",
    "it is shown that for excitation energies , which are small compared to the superconducting gap , the dirac hamiltonian of an p - n junction displays the same excitation spectrum as an n - s junction .",
    "new experiments preformed in graphene - based materials showed the evidence of the simultaneous occurrence of relativistic - like and superconducting transport that opens the possibility to study the implication of the relativistic - like electron behavior in the solid state . in @xcite heersche et al . studied the supercurrent flowing through a simple device constituted by two superconducting electrodes on the top of a carbon monolayer .",
    "they observed the occurrence of some new properties displayed by massless particles in graphene as for example the integer quantum hall effect and the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , a large rashba splitting ( corresponding to an energy shift of 225 mev ) of the @xmath1 states in an epitaxial graphene layer on a ni substrate has been reported in @xcite .    in particular , evidence has mounted that the scattering of electrons near the dirac point in graphene - superconductor junctions differs from the analogous andreev scattering process in normal metals and that the quasi - ballistic transport in graphene sheets is only weakly affected by external sources of disorder ( defects or impurities ) .",
    "in fact , dirac fermions are quite immune to the localization effects and it has been observed experimentally that electrons can propagate without scattering over distances of the order of micrometers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in high - density low - temperature regimes , the mobility is roughly density- and temperature - independent .",
    "although the interactions with the underlying substrate are largely responsible for the relaxation properties of particles in graphene ( possible sources of scattering include adsorbents and defects in the graphene lattice , ionized impurities in the silicon oxide substrate , surface charge traps , interfacial phonons and substrate ripples @xcite ) , the exact nature of the scattering that limits the mobility of electrons in graphene devices remains unclear .",
    "graphene is a semiconductor , whose band gap is exactly zero and the velocity of the charge carriers is over a wide range of energy independent of the momentum .",
    "graphene is expected to be in a low - conductivity state when the fermi energy approaches the dirac point where the density of states vanishes .",
    "a gate voltage can , however , modulate the density of states in graphene and switch between the low - conductivity state at the dirac point and the high - conductivity states elsewhere .",
    "the charge mobility in graphene layers attains large values that can not be reached in conventional semiconductors ( mobility of the order of @xmath2 have been recently measured @xcite ) .",
    "because of this high electronic mobility and the capability of being tuned from @xmath3-type to @xmath4-type doping by the application of a gate voltage , graphene is an interesting candidate towards possible applications in carbon - based electronics devices .",
    "in particular , some applications are already devised by various groups , for example in designing electronic building blocks @xcite or spin injection devices @xcite .",
    "moreover , when the fermi level approaches the dirac point , the density of states vanishes and it is expected that also the conductivity becomes strictly zero . on the contrary , the theoretical prediction of fradkin , given in @xcite , concerning the presence of a residual minimal charge conductivity ,",
    "was confirmed by experiments .",
    "the main reason of this phenomenon concerns the difficulty of localizing dirac - like particles in a single band .",
    "the possibility to perform easily band - to - band transitions , provided by the gap - less dirac - like form of the hamiltonian , reveals that the particles can travel over long distances ( or penetrate a potential barrier ) without creating a reflected component by converting itself in a electron - hole excitation . because of the strong similarity with relativistic quantum mechanics , the tunneling of an electron through an p - n graphene junction , where conduction - like states are converted into hole - like states ( and viceversa ) is denoted as klein tunneling .",
    "it represents the tunneling of a particle into the dirac sea of antiparticles ( represented by the almost filled hole band ) .",
    "in several recent experiments , this unusual coupling of electron- and hole - like dynamics have been investigated @xcite .",
    "klein tunneling gives rise to some unusual behavior of the charge transport when the fermi level approaches the dirac point , where the valence and conduction bands meet .",
    "in particular , an unusual interesting transport phenomenon of relativistic - like particles concerns the normal incidence of a particle - antiparticle beam on a square potential barrier .",
    "when the incidence angle becomes equal to zero , the barrier becomes completely transparent ( klein paradox ) .",
    "this result is characteristic for the dirac - like dispersion relation of the hamiltonian and contrasts the electron transport in normal ( nonrelativistic ) devices , where the band - to - band transmission probability is always smaller than one .",
    "in solid state physics , we are typically interested in macroscopic phenomena , which are slowly varying in time and smooth in space apart from variations on the atomic scales .",
    "the language used to describe electron transport is derived from the semi - classical picture of the dynamics where the electrons respond to external fields like point particles .",
    "there have been overwhelming evidences that such a simple picture can not give complete account of first - order effects in the fields .",
    "the development of efficient quantum computational methods is thus a crucial aspect in the study of new devices where quantum - mechanical effects play a dominant role .",
    "different approaches based on the density matrix , non - equilibrium green s functions , and the wigner function have been proposed to achieve a full quantum mechanical description of the electron transport @xcite . among them , the wigner - function formalism is the one that bears the closest similarities to the classical boltzmann equation , so that this formalism can be considered as a natural choice to derive quantum corrections to the classical phase - space motion .",
    "furthermore , a phase - space approach may appear more intuitive compared with the more abstract density matrix and green s function formalism .",
    "the phase - space formulation of quantum mechanics offers a framework in which quantum phenomena can be described with a classical language and the question of the quantum - classical correspondence can be directly investigated @xcite .    for these reasons ,",
    "an approach where both the kinetic characteristic of the particles and the pseudospin degree of freedom are described in a full - quantum mechanical framework , seems to be a promising approach to shed light on these particularities of graphene .",
    "the close similarity between the classical mechanics and a quantum kinetic framework , which characterizes the wigner single - band formalism , is generally lost when we address the many - band dynamics .",
    "in fact , a straightforward extension of the standard definition of the wigner function leads to very complicated multi - band systems , where a one - to - one relationship between band and distribution function can not be found . in general",
    ", it is not possible to define a quasi - distribution function associated to a single kind of particles ( holes or electrons ) and whose marginal distributions ( for example the integral with respect the momentum ) represents some expectation values of such particles .    in this contribution",
    ", we therefore present a wigner - like multiband formalism and study the effect of klein tunneling . in sec .",
    "[ sec mod ] the derivation of the quasi - diagonal equations of motion is presented and our approach is compared with some preexisting methods . in sec .",
    "[ sec unif ele ] we discuss the particles motion in the presence of a uniform electric field .",
    "particular emphasis is given on the close similarity between the description of the klein tunneling provided by our method and the classical particle transport .",
    "the numerical difficulties for a direct solution of the transport equations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec eff mod ] and an asymptotic approach is proposed . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec num sol full quant ] we study the particle motion in the presence of a rigid barrier .",
    "the atomic structure of graphene is characterized by two types of bonds and exhibits the so - called planar sp@xmath5 hybridization .",
    "the @xmath6 bonds are strong covalent bonds responsible for most of the binding energy and for the elastic properties of the graphene sheet . however , since the upper ( lower ) bound of the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) band is quite faraway the fermi energy ( more than 4 ev and 8 ev at the @xmath8 point for the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 orbital , respectively ) , bonding and anti - bonding @xmath6 bands can be safely neglected when addressing the electronic properties of graphene . the half - filled @xmath1 bands are responsible for the charge transport .",
    "the first who studied the graphene band structure was p. r. wallace in 1946 by using a tight binding approach @xcite .",
    "subsequently , more refined models were derived , providing a reliable theoretical basis for the description of the electronic properties of this material ( an exhaustive bibliography concerning this models can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath9 reproduces the spectrum of an electron - hole pair in a graphene sheet lying in the @xmath10 plane , in the presence of an external potential @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the fermi velocity , @xmath13 denotes the pauli matrices vector and @xmath14 the identity @xmath15 matrix . the valence and conduction bands are usually denoted as pseudo - spin components of the particle .    from a technological point of view",
    ", the direct integration of a graphene sheet in a device could cause some disadvantages .",
    "they are mainly related to the absence of an energy gap between the particles and holes at the fermi surfaces that prevents the electrons to be electrostatically confined in graphene .",
    "if compared with other open gap carbon - based structures , as for example carbon nano - ribbons ( where band gaps of nearly 1 ev are observed ) , the absence of a gap allows high current flows also in the off state .",
    "this strongly limits the application of a graphene sheet as a suitable channel in a carbon - based fet . for this reason ,",
    "we derive our evolution model for a more general hamiltonian than eq , containing an energy gap @xmath16 at @xmath17 : @xmath18    we establish the particle equation of motion in the quantum kinetic formalism by defining a suitable multi - component wigner function . from a technical point of view ,",
    "one of the main purposes of our approach is to describe the particle evolution by a set of wigner functions @xmath19 in such way that each function @xmath20 is the wigner transform of a mixture of electronic states belonging only to the @xmath21-th and @xmath22-th band .",
    "this ambitious goal would require the diagonalization of the pseudo - spinorial hamiltonian @xmath23 of eq . in the momentum as well as in the position space . however , this is in general impossible , due to the non - commutativity of these operators . in the following ,",
    "we propose a procedure that tries to define a set of basis states that diagonalize  as much as possible \" @xmath23 .",
    "for that reason , the corresponding set of wigner functions will be denoted as a  quasi - diagonal \" representation .",
    "we study the electron - hole pair system by means of the weyl quantization procedure .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we recall briefly the basic mathematical tools used in the weyl formulation . given a differential operator @xmath24 ( defined on a suitable hilbert space @xmath25 ) and a function @xmath26 , the weyl map @xmath27 ( h)= \\widehat{\\mathcal{a } } h $ ] , is defined as @xmath28 it establishes a unique correspondence between @xmath24 and a function @xmath29 which is denoted as the symbol of the operator .",

    "there , it becomes smoother and enlarges the spatial region where the gradient of the pseudo - potential ( representing an effective electric field ) differs from zero .",
    "this can be seen as a strong non - locality of the potential ( or equivalently of the electric field ) that is a peculiarity of the graphene band structure and reflects the property that a particle around the dirac point is quite immune to the localization effects . in our formalism , we describe this behavior by the presence of an effective potential @xmath87 that becomes more and more non - local when @xmath91 goes to zero .",

    "<S> the single graphene layer is a novel material consisting of a flat monolayer of carbon atoms packed in a two - dimensional honeycomb - lattice , in which the electron dynamics is governed by the dirac equation . </S>",
    "<S> a pseudo - spin phase - space approach based on the wigner - weyl formalism is used to describe the transport of electrons in graphene including quantum effects . </S>",
    "<S> our full - quantum mechanical representation of the particles reveals itself to be particularly close to the classical description of the particle motion . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the klein tunneling and the correction to the total current in graphene induced by this phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion are analytically investigated and some numerical tests are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution of the electron - hole pairs in the presence of an external electric field and a rigid potential step is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the connection of our formalism with the barry - phase approach is also discussed . </S>"
