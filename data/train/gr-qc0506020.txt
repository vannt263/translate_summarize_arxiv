    "<S> cosmic horizons arise in general relativity in the context of black holes and in certain cosmologies . </S>",

    "<S> however , quantum mechanical correlations may exist across horizons that may influence local observations . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of de  sitter space , we show how a single particle excitation behind the horizon changes the density matrix governing local observables . as compared to the vacuum state , we calculate the change in the average energy and entropy per unit volume . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , one would like to understand whether there is a statistical mechanical origin of the beckenstein entropy associated with the surface gravity or horizon of a black hole @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this issue is complicated further by the fact that the apparent horizon is frame dependent , so that the associated entropy is also observer dependent . </S>",
    "<S> usually , discussions implicitly make reference to stationary observers at infinity , and this frame dependence is ignored . similarly , hawking s black hole information paradox@xcite deals with the changes experienced by external observers who can measure black hole radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the challenges posed have led some to speculate that , ultimately , local qft as we know , must break down even at distances large compared to the planck length @xcite . indeed , the holographic principle suggests that quantum field theory in general has many redundant degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> similar paradoxes beset special reference frames or cosmological situations in which there exist horizons , for which different observers may describe things quite differently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an observer dependence was recently discussed by comparing observers in rindler and minkowski reference frames @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several approaches to these problems have illuminated the issues , while not resolving them completely . for eternal black holes , where there is a delicately arranged balance between incoming and outgoing radiation , a microscopic explanation is available , at least in some cases , in terms of israel s thermofield formulation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> israel s construction , which may seem a bit artificial for ordinary systems in flat spacetime , becomes natural for systems with horizons . </S>",
    "<S> this is conceptually quite satisfying , inasmuch as the global structure of the qft is that of a unique state , whereas the entropy ascribed to an observer is associated with the inability to access states behind the horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of de  sitter space in static coordinates can be put into one- to - one correspondence with israel s discussion of the schwarzschild black hole @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an observer in the southern diamond is classically blind to events occurring in the northern diamond . in this brief note </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that quantum correlations provide a window for this observer to peek into the northern diamond . in light of this result </S>",
    "<S> , we will reflect on some of the so - called failures of qft in this context .    </S>",
    "<S> in the next section , we review the construction of the vacuum state for a scalar field in de  sitter background . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the effects of a single particle excitation in the northern diamond on the mean energy ( section  3 ) and entropy ( section  4 ) associated with an observer in the southern diamond . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize our results and discuss some of their implications in section  5 .    </S>",
    "<S> preliminaries to be self - contained , we will review in this section the description of a scalar field in de  sitter background . </S>",

    "<S> but one can define different vacua with respect to different coordinate systems which appears equally ` natural ' in them . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider static coordinates in de  sitter space . </S>",

    "<S> these coordinates may be extended outside this causal diamond ; for @xmath20 the roles of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are reversed , and @xmath15 becomes spacelike . </S>",
    "<S> these coordinates describe only half of de  sitter space , with the remaining half described by replacing @xmath21 by @xmath23 in the formulas above . </S>",
    "<S> the klein - gordon equation in these coordinates is @xmath24 it has a solution for a given energy @xmath25 and angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 are the spherical harmonics and the function @xmath29 is a hypergeometric function . </S>",
    "<S> these form a complete set of states for solutions regular at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> but they can not be extended to the whole of de  sitter space . </S>",
    "<S> one can similarly define modes in the northern diamond as @xmath31 one can consider the mode expansions @xmath32 on any spacelike slice through the origin , the @xmath33 and @xmath34 together form a complete set of functions for all of de  sitter space . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we may take @xmath35 the creation and annihilation operators obey canonical commutation relations . since modes in one diamond have no support in the other , one can take the corresponding operators to commute , @xmath36=0.\\ ] ] as indicated in fig .  1 , the coordinate @xmath21 representing time runs in forward direction in the southern diamond and backwards in the northern one . </S>",
    "<S> so the modes in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> one may then define a vacuum state as @xmath40 henceforth , we shall simply abbreviate this vacuum , which differs from the euclidean vacuum , as @xmath41 when reference to the quantum numbers is not required . </S>",
    "<S> note that the associated fock space is the direct product of the southern and northern fock spaces , @xmath42    energy change by particle excitation    components of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in equations  ( [ phis ] ) and ( [ phin ] ) together account for a complete set of modes in de  sitter space . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath50 then it can be shown that @xmath51 measurements are classical , so an observer in the southern diamond can not directly probe states of the northern diamond . from the point of view of a  southern \" observer , all observables can be obtained from the density matrix formed by tracing over all the states corresponding to the northern diamond modes.@xcite thus , a particular observer actually appears to see a mixed state , even though the vacuum is a unique state globally . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 calculating the contribution for a given mode ( say,@xmath53 ) , @xmath54 this gives @xmath55 where @xmath56 here , the prime over the product denotes that it is evaluated over all modes the particular mode ( @xmath57 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can check that the density matrix is properly normalised , _ </S>",

    "<S> @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> now suppose a single excitation of @xmath59 mode of northern type is created in euclidean vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> since its wavefunction vanishes in southern diamond , one might naively expect the southern diamond observer to remain blind to this excitation </S>",
    "<S> . the corresponding density matrix would be @xmath60 to keep the density matrix normalised properly , the normalization factor must be taken to be @xmath61 therefore @xmath62 the change in average energy in the southern diamond observer due to the excitation of a northern diamond mode in euclidean vacuum is therefore @xmath63\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\nu}{({\\rm e}^{2\\pi \\nu } -1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is precisely the energy @xmath64 of a single particle in a mixed state corresponding to a bose - einstein distribution at the temperature @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy change corresponding to an observer in the northern diamond can be calculated in a similar fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding density matrix for the case without any particles excited is obtained by tracing over all the states corresponding to the southern diamond . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 the normalised northern diamond density matrix for one particle being created would be @xmath67 the change in energy corresponding to the northern diamond observer due to the excitation of a northern diamond mode in euclidean vacuum is @xmath68\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\nu}{(1-{\\rm e}^{-2\\pi \\nu } ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can check that @xmath69 , the total change in energy in de  sitter space due to a single particle excitation in the northern diamond .    </S>",
    "<S> the lesson is that , because the euclidean vacuum involves states in which the southern and northern excitations are correlated , an excitation in the northern diamond does have observable consequences in the southern diamond , even though a southern observer can not directly probe northern states . of course , to interpret the density matrix </S>",
    "<S> , a southern observer would need to know much about the global state , but symmetry principles and the properties of quantum field theory go a long way toward determining them.@xcite    change in entropy one can also calculate the entropy change observed by static observers due to a northern diamond mode excitation . the entropy is simply @xmath70 to evaluate this , it is convenient to introduce some additional notation </S>",
    "<S> . let @xmath71 and let @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the matrices corresponding to @xmath74 submatrices of @xmath75 and @xmath76 in the southern diamond . then @xmath77 the change in entropy noted by southern diamond observer turns out to be @xmath78 the change in the entropy from the point of view of a northern diamond observer is the same , since globally the system is in a pure state . </S>",
    "<S> this is a special case of an important general theorem about the entropy of factorized subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> when a system is in a pure state , each subsystem has the same set of nonzero eigenvalues , even if their dimension is different . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even though the excitations appear very different in the two causal diamonds , and the change in energy in each is very different , the change in entropy is the same .    </S>",
    "<S> conclusion    the euclidean vacuum is a pure state with respect to the global de  sitter space . </S>",
    "<S> any observation can at best determine correlation functions within a causal domain . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of cosmological horizons in spacetime renders it impossible to measure correlations everywhere , so all observables can be obtained from a density matrix formed by tracing over states outside of the causal domain . </S>",
    "<S> thus , any observer perceives a mixed state . in the case of the euclidean vacuum </S>",
    "<S> , an observer in static coordinates perceives a density matrix corresponding to a thermal state .    </S>",
    "<S> naively , one might think that an observer in the southern diamond , for example , would be insensitive to an excitation in the northern diamond because its past support and influence in the future lie entirely outside the southern diamond . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of correlations in the euclidean vacuum , such excitations change the density matrix for the southern diamond and , therefore , can influence measurements there . we have illustrated this for the case of a single particle excitation in the northern diamond , but the lesson is quite general .    </S>",
    "<S> these seemingly acausal results are reminiscent of other nonintuitive correlations in quantum mechanics , as with the epr paradox @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while we have discussed only the case of a particular cosmological horizon , the same reasoning may help explain some of the properties of black holes . certainly ,  </S>",
    "<S> eternal \" black holes , such as the classical schwarzschild geometry , will have their immediate counterparts to our discussion . </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps not so incredible that a similar situation is obtained for the case of gravitational collapse from a pure state to a black hole followed by its subsequent evaporation due to hawking radiation . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations across classical horizons may help resolve the so - called black hole information paradox @xcite . </S>"
