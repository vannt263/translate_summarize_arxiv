    "<S> numerical data on the probability distribution of the equilibrium relaxation time of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model are obtained by means of dynamical monte carlo simulation , for several values of the system size @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> proper care is taken that the thermal fluctuations on the relaxation time estimates are totally negligible compared to the disorder induced fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of @xmath2 scales with the scaling variable @xmath3 strengthening the belief that @xmath4 in the whole spin glass phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium dynamics of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model remains a subject of much interest . </S>",
    "<S> the standard picture of the spin glass phase of this model is that of a complex hierarchical free energy landscape , with many valleys that correspond to pure or metastable states . in the thermodynamic limit , both </S>",
    "<S> the number of valleys and the height of the typical free energy barrier between two valleys go to infinity . accordingly </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation time of the system diverges as the number of spins @xmath0 goes to infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the equilibrium relaxation time of the model @xmath5 with the system size @xmath0 has been studied by analytical methods  @xcite , direct monte carlo simulation of the metropolis dynamics of the model  , and indirect determination of the largest barrier height  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are reasonable indications that below @xmath6 the disorder averaged relaxation time behaves according to @xmath7 as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the largest barrier height and an exponent @xmath10 , for both binary and gaussian distributions of the couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the relaxation time of this model with the system size @xmath0 has also been studied in the aging ( non equilibrium ) regime  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a different numerical approach to this problem has been used recently by monthus and garel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( this method has already been used in  @xcite for the 2d ising model and in  @xcite for the sk model . ) </S>",
    "<S> they use the well know mapping ( see e.g. chapter 4 of  @xcite ) of the master equation for the monte carlo dynamics onto an schrdinger equation in configuration space with some quantum hamiltonian @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 stands for a particular disorder configuration ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of @xmath11 has zero energy , corresponding to the equilibrium stationary state of the monte carlo dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the next eigenvalue is the inverse of the largest relaxation time @xmath13 of the monte carlo dynamics of the original model ( the so called exponential relaxation time of the dynamics  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of determining @xmath13 is thus reduced to the problem of finding the lowest eigenvalues of a real symmetric sparse matrix ( of size @xmath14 ) , which can be obtained with high accuracy using a standard computer routine . </S>",
    "<S> the process has to be repeated for a large number of disorder configurations @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> compared to the direct monte carlo method , the method of monthus and garel has two clear advantages : i ) it is not affected by thermal noise ; ii ) the long tail of the probability distribution @xmath15 can be easily sampled . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , provided a good starting point is guessed , the convergence of the eigenvalue search is very fast . </S>",
    "<S> the method is however limited to very small system sizes , indeed the analysis of  @xcite relies on systems with @xmath16 , to be compared with the nine years old direct simulations of  @xcite where @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in principle a strong limitation for a model that is critical in the whole low temperature phase with slowly decaying power law finite size corrections . </S>",
    "<S> for example for such small sizes the shape of the probability distribution of the order parameter @xmath18 is strongly affected by finite size effects and is quite different from the textbook shape of the infinite volume limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of monthus and garel for the sk model with gaussian couplings at temperature @xmath19 can be summarized as follows : the disorder averaged logarithm of the largest relaxation time behaves according to    @xmath20    on small systems ( @xmath21 ) already . </S>",
    "<S> the probability density function of @xmath22 scales like    @xmath23    using the measured values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with an @xmath0 independent @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> monthus and garel are not able to measure the width exponent @xmath27 defined by @xmath28 ( which means that it is crucial to use the measured values of @xmath29 and @xmath25 in equation  [ pn ] , at least for small systems ) , but make a tentative indirect estimate @xmath30 from their measurement of the tail exponent @xmath31 ( defined later in equation  [ tail ] ) and an assumption about the disorder configurations that dominate the tail of @xmath32 for @xmath33 . in  @xcite already , the quoted value of @xmath34 is lower than @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark however that the figure 1 of  @xcite shows systematic errors as big as @xmath36 in the value of @xmath37 from fits of data with @xmath38 , which are blamed on finite size effects . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the results of  @xcite and  @xcite for @xmath27 ( that is harder to measure than @xmath37 ) is accordingly somewhat surprising .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this note is to investigate the distribution @xmath15 using the direct monte carlo simulation method , which gives access to much larger system sizes than the method of  @xcite , and without the strong assumptions about the dynamics of the multi canonical algorithm made in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath39 disorder samples ( with binary couplings ) and measure for each sample the dynamical overlap    @xmath40    averaging over @xmath41 along a long trajectory starting from a well equilibrated spin configuration   parallel tempering sweeps with @xmath42 temperatures uniformly distributed inside @xmath43 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are ample empirical evidences ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that this is enough to achieve equilibrium , for values of @xmath44 and @xmath0 up to @xmath45 , namely one obtains symmetric overlap probability distributions disorder sample by disorder sample , and the values of the internal energy and disordered averaged overlap squared @xmath46 converge with excellent accuracy to the exact thermodynamic limit . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 and there is in our opinion no doubt that equilibrium has been achieved . </S>",
    "<S> ] , i.e. we measure the thermal averaged @xmath48 at equilibrium . in practice a chain of @xmath49 metropolis sweeps ( with sequential site update  @xcite ) was generated for two independent copies of the system ( two clones ) , starting from two independent spin configurations , for each disorder sample . </S>",
    "<S> measurements were made every @xmath50 sweeps ( namely the average was done over the values @xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it would be a waste of cpu time to measure the value of @xmath52 for every ( integer ) values of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> it was measured for the following values : [ 1 - 20 ] with lag 1 , [ 22 - 40 ] with lag 2 , [ 44 - 80 ] with lag 4 ,  . </S>",
    "<S> altogether @xmath52 was measured for 194 values of @xmath53 , up to a maximum value of @xmath54 . for @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> a smaller chain of @xmath56 metropolis sweeps was generated , and @xmath52 was measured for 183 values of @xmath53 up to a maximum value of @xmath57 only . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation time @xmath58 is defined by the condition @xmath59 , where the mean value of the static overlap squared @xmath60 has been measured at equilibrium in the same disorder sample . </S>",
    "<S> note that the ratio @xmath61 is dimensionless and is accordingly   where @xmath62 is the momentum , @xmath63 the frequency , with some function @xmath64 . integrating over @xmath62 in order to have the @xmath65 correlation function and </S>",
    "<S> after fourier transform , this equation becomes @xmath66 with some function @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> using hyperscaling it mean that @xmath68 is a function of @xmath69 only . ] a function of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> namely @xmath71 , with some @xmath72 that is a continuously decreasing function of its argument . </S>",
    "<S> the precise analytical form of @xmath72 is irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that , disorder sample by disorder sample , the difference between @xmath52 measured using clone one and @xmath52 measured using clone two is so small that both give in most cases indistinguishable results for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the worst case is for @xmath73 and @xmath74 with a relative error of @xmath75 for a particular bad disorder sample , namely the observed discrepancy is always smaller than @xmath75 , when not exactly zero , for more interesting values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . ) </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the plus or minus one standard deviation estimates of @xmath52 give the same estimate for @xmath58 to an excellent precision , and that accordingly the thermal noise is negligible . that the thermal errors are negligible </S>",
    "<S> can alternatively be seen as follows : at fixed @xmath12 , with @xmath76 independent measurements of @xmath77 , namely @xmath78 , one has the elementary unbiased estimator of @xmath79 , the thermal statistical error on @xmath80 , given by the expression @xmath81 . in our simulation </S>",
    "<S> the two clones provide two fully independent measurements of @xmath77 , and we have accordingly the unbiased ( but noisy ) estimator @xmath82 . as mentioned before , the ratio @xmath83 is very small for all disorder sample @xmath12 , system size @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the disorder averaged @xmath84 is less than one percent of the median of @xmath22 for all values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( for obvious reasons , we consider only the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that the median of @xmath85 is less than @xmath86 , and the average of @xmath87 is restricted to the disorder samples for which @xmath88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder average of @xmath89 is even smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the thermal noise is negligible is an essential condition in order to obtain meaningful estimates for the probability distribution of the relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the various parameters ( the total run length , the window of measurement @xmath86 , and the lag between two successive measurements ) have been chosen empirically , they are such that the thermal noise is negligible ( as we just said ) , the cpu times spent in monte carlo updates and measurements are balanced and the program fits inside the computer memory . </S>",
    "<S> no attempt was made to optimize theses parameters , it should in principle be done separately for each disorder sample , each size @xmath0 and each temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the time scales considered in  @xcite are different from the one considered here , indeed  @xcite considers time scales ( called @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 in  @xcite ) that can be defined from the time decay of @xmath52 measured with a single starting point @xmath41 on the one hand , and time scales ( called @xmath93 and @xmath94 in  @xcite ) defined from the time decay of the disorder averaged @xmath95 ( or @xmath96 ) on the other hand . </S>",
    "<S> the time scales @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 have both thermal and disorder fluctuations , whereas @xmath93 and @xmath94have no disorder fluctuations by construction . </S>",
    "<S> the time scales considered in the present note are disorder dependent with negligible thermal noise contamination . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of  @xcite was indeed to show that all time scales in the sk model behave according to @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have data for @xmath73 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , with temperatures between @xmath101 and @xmath102 with steps of @xmath103 ( the critical temperature of the model is @xmath104 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ figure1 ] shows a scaling plot of @xmath105 as a function of @xmath106 for @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative statistical error on the value of @xmath108 inside a bin is @xmath109 , with @xmath110 the number of data points inside the bin . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ figure1 ] show good scaling , confirming that @xmath111 has a behavior compatible with @xmath112 , namely ( in this formula @xmath113 is an @xmath0 independent function , related to the function @xmath114 introduced above ) ,    @xmath115    extending the scaling of the probability distribution found in  @xcite from @xmath21 to @xmath47 , with both @xmath116 and @xmath117 explicitly proportional to @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> data taken at other values of the temperature ( below @xmath6 ) show similar scaling . depending on the temperature our sampling of the tail of the probability distribution </S>",
    "<S> is limited by the number of monte carlo sweeps performed ( this is the case at low temperature ) or by the number of disorder samples used ( this is the case at higher temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> since we are plotting the logarithm of the ( histogrammed ) probability distribution of the logarithm of the relaxation time , enlarging substantially the data range in figure  [ figure1 ] would require a huge increase of the computational effort .    </S>",
    "<S> implicit in figure  [ figure1 ] is that the width @xmath117 scales with the same exponent @xmath35 as the mean . </S>",
    "<S> this can be checked directly : following  @xcite we have computed the median @xmath119 of the distribution of @xmath80 and a width @xmath120 defined arbitrarily by @xmath121 . the use of the median of the distribution instead of the average , and of a width defined from the quantiles of the distribution has the advantage that the later is only defined if @xmath122 for all disorder samples whereas the former requires that at least one half of the disorder samples satisfy this bound . </S>",
    "<S> the computational gain is enormous with a distribution that has a very long tail towards large values of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath123 as a function of @xmath0 is shown in figure  [ figure2 ] for several temperatures ( without statistical errors ) . </S>",
    "<S> it shows a weak @xmath0 dependence , consistent with the same scaling for the width and the disorder average of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> ( as a function of @xmath1 however the ration @xmath123 decreases slightly as @xmath1 grows . ) </S>",
    "<S> indeed a plot of @xmath124 as a function of @xmath125 shows the same scaling as figure  [ figure1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion for the behavior of the distribution of @xmath80 with @xmath0 is that , going to quite larger system sizes confirm the results of monthus and garel . with larger systems </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no need anymore to use the measured mean value and width of the distribution , in scaling plots . assuming that both scale like @xmath118 just does it . </S>",
    "<S> comparing to previous   numerical determinations of the exponent @xmath37 , the fact that the whole distribution , and not only the median , scales with the exponent @xmath112 strengthens the conclusion that the exponent is indeed @xmath112 .     at fixed temperature @xmath107.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]     of the distribution divided by the median @xmath119 , as a function of @xmath0 for several temperatures.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the behavior of the function @xmath126 for large values of @xmath127 defines the tail exponent @xmath31 ,    @xmath128    that is @xmath129 according to monthus and garel  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath130 would imply a linear slope in figure  [ figure1 ] , whereas the value @xmath131 would imply a slight downwards curvature . </S>",
    "<S> both values are clearly compatible with our data , that unfortunately do not sample deep enough inside the tail of @xmath132 to allow a meaningful estimate of @xmath31 .     of the probability distribution @xmath133 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath134.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    since we have data for several values of the temperature , we can see if our probability distributions scale with the temperature also . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that , at fixed temperature , the distribution of the largest barrier scales like @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> since the sherrington - kirkpatrick model is a mean field model , the scaling combination is @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the upper critical dimension of the theory and @xmath137  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the probability distribution of the relaxation time has been known for some time for the spherical sherrington - kirkpatrick , and is of this form indeed  @xcite ,    @xmath138    with @xmath139 a random variable ( independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath140 is the difference between the two largest eigenvalues of the coupling matrix of the model . </S>",
    "<S> mathematical proof of this scaling behavior and the expression for the probability distribution of @xmath139 can be found in  @xcite .    in figure  [ figure4 ] </S>",
    "<S> we check the hypothesis that indeed @xmath141 with @xmath142 a random variable ( with a distribution that does not depend on @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows reasonable scaling , even if the temperatures are not so close to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the scaling quality deteriorates if one adds points closer to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this seems paradoxical , the likely explanation is that @xmath13 is not a pure exponential and that sub - leading power law contributions to @xmath13 becomes important close to @xmath6 where the dominant term in the exponential goes to zero , since at @xmath6 one has @xmath143 . in order to obtain a good scaling at fixed @xmath0 it is crucial to consider the distribution of @xmath144 as is done in figure  [ figure4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> there is no such need at fixed @xmath1 like in figure  [ figure1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the likely explanation is that @xmath145 behaves like @xmath118 but not like @xmath146 , or that sub - leading power law contributions to @xmath13 are important .     as a function of the temperature , for @xmath73 to @xmath100.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ figure5 ] shows the ratio @xmath147 , where the overline is here the usual arithmetic average ( using the median would give a trivial result ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be a constant , independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , if @xmath13 was proportional to @xmath148 . </S>",
    "<S> small scaling violations are visible , the data for increasing number of spins @xmath0 seem to converge toward a value with a small temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with our remark about the behavior of @xmath145 as function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the paragraph above . </S>",
    "<S> we remark en passant that if following  @xcite and  @xcite we had @xmath149 , then @xmath150,with some constant @xmath151 , and should accordingly converge towards one , with unfortunately extremely slowly decaying corrections .    </S>",

    "<S> ^ 2}$ ] . for @xmath134 and @xmath100 the value of the kurtosis is strongly affected by a few rare disorder samples with large values of @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> restriction the analysis to @xmath73 and @xmath98 , one obtains values of @xmath153 with little or no temperature dependence , but finite size effects .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the probability distribution of the equilibrium relaxation time of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model with binary couplings , for a range of system size and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we checked that our estimates are free of thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> the data confirm that both the average and the width of the probability distribution of @xmath80 scale as @xmath154 in the spin glass phase . as a last remark </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the long tail of the distribution of @xmath5 may be a hidden source of severe problems in numerical simulations with the widespread practice of using the same number of monte carlo iterations for all disorder samples . </S>",
