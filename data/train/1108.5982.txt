    "hayabusa , the third engineering space mission of jaxa / isas ( japan aerospace exploration agency / institute of space and astronautical sciences ) had several engineering technologies to verify in space ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "hayabusa was launched on may 9 , 2003 . on september 12 , 2005 ,",
    "hayabusa arrived at the asteroid ( 25143 ) itokawa .",
    "the mission was the first to reveal that itokawa is a rubble - pile body rather than a single monolithic asteroid among @xmath5-class asteroids ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the spacecraft performed a landing on itokawa to collect asteroid samples in november , 2005 .",
    "due to a loss of communications , hayabusa started an orbit transfer to return to the earth in april , 2007 .",
    "the round - trip travel between the earth and itokawa with the aid of ion engine propulsion was the first success of its kind in the world ( @xcite ) .",
    "on june 13 , 2010 , the hayabusa spacecraft returned to the earth with the re - entry capsule containing asteroid samples .",
    "the sample return capsule was separated at 10:51 ut , which was just 3 hours before the atmospheric re - entry . due to the failure of all bi - propellant thrusters for orbital maneuvering , the hayabusa spacecraft could not escape from its earth collision course .",
    "though japan had several successful experiences with re - entry capsule tests ( e.g. , rft-2 ( 1992 ) , orex ( 1994 ) , express ( 1995 ) , hyfrex ( 1996 ) , and users ( 2003 ) ) , the hayabusa sample return capsule was the first japanese re - entry opportunity that entered the earth s atmosphere directly from an interplanetary transfer orbit with a velocity over 12 km / s .",
    "the hayabusa sample return capsule and the spacecraft entered the atmosphere at 13:51 ut .",
    "the hayabusa spacecraft disintegrated in the atmosphere , and the capsule flew nominally and landed approximately 500 m from its targeted landing point .",
    "spectroscopy of the hayabusa re - entry was a golden opportunity to understand ( i ) the atmospheric influence upon earth impactors such as meteors , meteorites and meter - sized mini - asteroids , because for such natural bodies the original material , mass , and shape are all unknown ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; for hayabusa , not only these parameters but also the re - entry trajectory were under perfect control , ( ii ) the hypervelocity impact of large objects that are difficult to reproduce in laboratory experiments , and ( iii ) the flight environment of re - entry capsules for the utilization of future japanese sample return missions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when the surface temperature of hayabusa reached about 2000 k , occurring at a height around 100 km , the spacecraft material started to sublimate from the surface and was surrounded by evaporated vapors .",
    "excited states of atoms of these vapors were gradually de - excited by radiation .",
    "hayabusa luminosity consisted mostly of radiation of discrete emission spectral lines belonging under the most part to metals and mainly to iron .",
    "ablation particles injected into the flow also emitted radiation as a continuum spectrum due to their temperature .",
    "thus , observed atomic spectrum was mixed with thermal continuum and molecular bands . subtracting these background ,",
    "excitation temperature and element intensities were estimated under the assumption of a local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) condition .",
    "table  [ tb_element ] gives the derived physical quantities .",
    "the excitation temperature was estimated using fe and mg lines around the 5000  5500 wavelength range .",
    "the derived excitation temperatures were 6000 k at heights of 84.5 km and 62.7 km , and 4500 k at a height of 54.9 km .",
    "these excitation temperatures are comparable to a normal meteor temperature , @xmath05000 k ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the excitation temperature range between 5000 k  6000 k caused by a large bolide ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the ratio of fe / mg was 0.6 at a height of 84.5 km , the ratio increased to 10 below a height of 62.7 km . since hayabusa was made with much more fe than mg , it is likely that iron was conspicuously evaporated during the explosion phase .",
    "detected ti lines seem to originate from fuel and gas tanks , and also bolts with nuts that were made of ti-6al-4v .",
    "h line ( 4861  ) is possibly present , presumably as a result of the dissociation of n@xmath6h@xmath7 which was used as thruster fuel , meaning that some of the thrusting fuel remained at re - entry . all other elements ( ni , cr , and mn ) were probably used for constructing the hayabusa spacecraft . though hg was identified as the most probable element to explain the presence of lines at 4358 and 5461  , details are proprietary information that were not available to the authors .",
    "the detected na , especially at heights of 62.7 km and 54.9 km , is not likely to have originated from the atmosphere ; although earth s atmosphere contains natural sodium known as the sodium layer at a height of 80  105 km which originated from meteoroids , this sodium is more rare at these low altitudes .",
    "therefore , sodium must have originated from material ablated by the hayabusa spacecraft or its capsule .",
    "sodium was also detected by the stardust capsule at altitudes of 54  48 km ( @xcite ) .",
    "o and n are most likely atmospheric lines , or a part of o and n arising from the fuel oxidizer , n@xmath6o@xmath7 .",
    "o , n , h , and xe are of high excitation atoms which require either high temperature or a large amount of atoms to be detected . therefore , these atoms are thought to be excited by the shock layer . on the other hand , typical lines of the high temperature components as seen in the meteor plasma such as mg ( 4481  ) and",
    "fe ( e.g. , 4583 , 4923 , and 5018",
    " ) have not been detected in hayabusa spectra .",
    "the one explanation for the absence of mg and fe is that the emissions of o , n , h , and xe arise promptly from the shock layer in the gas  gas phase , while the ablation of solid mg and fe should transform into a gas phase that takes more time than gas  gas transformation because of the low velocity ( @xmath010 km / s ) compared with typical meteors ( @xmath040 km / s ) .",
    "the vibration temperature of molecular n@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) was dramatically changed from 4000 k at a height of 92.5 km to 13000 k at a height of 82.9 km ( table  [ tb_identifyuv ] ; figure  [ uv_cal ] ) .",
    "the observed spectra are a superposition of the post shock plasma radiation which is mixed with a shock layer heating and downward plasma .",
    "thus , it is logical to understand that the high temperature region was induced by a shock layer of the hayabusa spacecraft which rapidly grew between 92.5 km and 82.9 km in height .",
    "the molecular band of n@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) was also observed in the spectrum of the stardust re - entry capsule with a rotational temperature of 15000 k at heights between 71.5 km and 62 km ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , at a height of 84 km , n@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) was detected with a vibration temperature of @xmath010000 k from a 4 magnitude bright fireball of the leonid meteor shower whose entry velocity was @xmath072 km / s ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flux of the spacecraft at a height of 62.7 km ( 12 absolute magnitude ) was about 1600 times brighter than that of the capsule s flux ( 4 absolute magnitude at the maximum ) .",
    "therefore , the n@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) bands originated from the spacecraft was much stronger than cn bands originated from the capsule in which c was the major erosion product of the carbon - phenol heat shield of the capsule as seen by the stardust capsule ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "clear c lines were also observed in the near - infrared spectrum ( around 1 @xmath8 m wavelength ) of the stardust reentry capsule ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the vibrational and rotational temperatures of cn violet bands were measured to be 8000 @xmath9 1000 k in the stardust capsule at a height of 60 km ( @xcite ) .",
    "n coupling occurs at a higher excited state than a ground state , and then vibration - rotation temperature approaches to the translational temperature .",
    "for instance , the estimated translation temperature in the shock layer of the capsule was 1100013000 k. hence , the vibration - rotation temperature of @xmath013000 k for n@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and cn is reasonable .",
    "bright fireballs sometimes leave a self - luminous long - lasting plasma at altitudes of about 8090 km that is called persistent trains. it is generally believed that the luminosity of persistent trains is fueled by reactions involving o@xmath10 and atomic o , efficiently catalyzed by metals from the freshly ablated meteoroids ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a persistent train was observed at heights between 92 km and to 82 km for about 3 minutes(@xcite ) .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that sufficient metals were supplied by the ablation of the spacecraft at these heights .",
    "it is important to understand how meteoroids and meteors supply the earth with space matter including organics and water ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "meteors represent a unique chemical pathway towards prebiotic compounds on the early earth and a significant fraction of organic matter is expected to survive .",
    "thus , the investigations of oh(@xmath3-@xmath4 ) in the hayabusa spectrum is of particular interest .",
    "the most likely mechanism for emitting oh(@xmath3-@xmath4 ) band in the meteor is caused by the dissociation of water or mineral water in the meteoroid .",
    "our possible detection of oh(@xmath3-@xmath4 ) band indicates an earthly origin caused by the dissociation of water in the upper atmosphere .",
    "however , due to blending with other atomic lines such as mg , fe , and al , further spectroscopy with higher resolution and sensitivity around 3090    will be needed for further confirmation .      a continuum consisting of a gray - body emission of the capsule at near - ultraviolet and visible wavelengths",
    "was examined .",
    "a continuum radiation of the capsule obtained at a height of @xmath042 km was that of a gray - body at a fitted temperature employing planck s formula .",
    "our derived temperature from an excellent uv - ii data set was 2437 @xmath9 14 k at a height of 41.8 km ( figure  [ gray ] ) .",
    "the surface temperature of 2525 k @xmath9 50 k at a height of 41.1 km was estimated based on radiative equilibrium computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observed temperature agrees qualitatively with the cfd model prediction .",
    "the gray - body temperature observed from naoj s team at coober pedy resulted in @xmath02400 @xmath9 300 k at a height of @xmath040.5 km ( @xcite ) which is comparable with our result .",
    "note that dynamical pressure at a height around 40 km was the maximum @xmath064 kpa ( @xcite ) . at the gos3 site ,",
    "a strong sequence of sonic booms was detected at 13:55:21 ut using a video recorder s microphone which was observed at tarcoola by y. akita and his colleagues .",
    "a sonic boom is the sound associated with a shock wave created by the supersonic flight of the capsule .",
    "according to this time delay , the shock wave generation point was estimated at a height around 40 km . considering these fluid conditions ,",
    "further analysis will be made in a forthcoming paper ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "at 13:51:50 ut on june 13 , 2010 , the hayabusa spacecraft appeared as planned in the dark sky over the australian desert , along with the faint dot of the capsule .",
    "the hayabusa spacecraft was flying behind the capsule , roughly 1 km above as if he must protect his tiger cub . while the spacecraft burst into many fragments , as if falling into the milky way , the capsule became an independent bright fireball wearing an ablative heat shield as its thermal protection system ( tps ) , as if demonstrating its will to overcome adversity .",
    "the planned atmospheric re - entry was perfectly completed .",
    "the hayabusa spacecraft ended his journey in a brilliant flash of light that provided us a treasure trove of `` artificial fireball '' data , which has never been observed in a scientific way .",
    "atomic lines such as fe , mg , na , al , cr , mn , ni , ti , li , zn , o , and n were identified .",
    "the excitation temperature ranging from 4500 k to 6000 k was estimated using fe and mg within the 5000  5500   wavelength region , which is similar to a common excitation temperature of meteors and bolides .",
    "the identification of emission lines may be inadequate and contain some unknown lines .",
    "exotic atoms such as cu , mo , xe , and hg were also identified .",
    "the explosion of the spacecraft injected a large amount of iron which increased the density of fe .",
    "the surprising strong red line during the last flash of the spacecraft was well explained by a li line ( 6708  ) that was probably caused by explosions of the onboard li - ion batteries .",
    "a clearly detected feo band at a height of @xmath063 km is similar to a common bolide spectrum which is likely to emit in the wake , where the radiation is emitted just behind the body .",
    "the alteration in the hot plasma temperature of n@xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) bands ( from 4000 k to 13000 k ) appears to be the strongest proof that an intense shock layer around the hayabusa spacecraft was rapidly formed at heights between 93 km and 83 km .",
    "the gray - body temperatures ranging from 2482 k to 2395 k were measured at heights between 42.7 km and 41.2 km that can be explained by the cfd model prediction .",
    "further investigation is required to understand the performance of the tps .",
    "our experiences will be instructive in observing the planned hayabusa - ii earth return mission .",
