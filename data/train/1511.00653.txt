    "for a black hole ( bh hereafter ) if mass is the only characteristic parameter , we get the event horizon .",
    "crossing through this event horizon shows swapping of the role of temparal and spatial co - ordinates .",
    "it s a singular region around the @xmath0 singularity .",
    "this will not let any information to come outside from inside .",
    "but except the mass whenever we introduce other parameters the scenario changes .",
    "say , for reissner nordstr@xmath1 m bh , if the charge of the bh is less than its mass(measured in geometric units @xmath2 ) , then two horizons exist . between the two horizons , space acts like a waterfall , falling faster than the speed of light .",
    "using boyer - lindquist co - ordinates for kerr metric , we see when @xmath0 and @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) we get singularities .",
    "it gives @xmath5 from outer layer to inner layer we see , one by one , different general relativistic backgrounds : ( i ) outer ergosurface @xmath6 ( ii ) ergoregion ( iii ) outer event horizon @xmath7 ( iv ) inner event horizon @xmath8 ( v ) inner ergossurface @xmath9    now , general relativity(gr hereafter ) admits well posed initial value problem .",
    "if we provide some initial data on the spacelike hyper- surface , say @xmath10 , the solution to the einstein equation is uniquely determined everywhere within the domain of dependence @xmath11 of @xmath10 .",
    "there are several examples of space times for which @xmath11 is unable to cover the total manifold @xmath12 .",
    "this emplies that even if we provide a suitable initial data on @xmath10 , gr is unable to forecast the evolution of spacetime beyond @xmath11 in these cases .",
    "the boundary of @xmath11 denoted by @xmath13 , is known as cauchy horizon(ch hereafter ) .",
    "this horizon is acting as a barrier line of two regions : one , where gr is able to predict the evolution and second , where predictability of the field equations is lost . for a bh",
    "we say the second large horizon to be the cauchy horizon .",
    "infinite proper time compression effect will make the journey from event horizon to ch unstable .",
    "the casual past i.e. , the set of all source points from which time like curves are coming to ch , contains the entire universe external to the concerned bh . so any observer who is approaching to the ch , few moments before he crosses the ch , sees the entire history of external universe to flash infront of eyes .",
    "besides all the physical understandings of ch , there is a broad mathematical view of it . since @xmath14 s , a consistent picture of a classically stable ch @xcite in bh@xmath15 de sitter space time has emerged .",
    "both linear studies and non - linear back reaction calculation indicate that the ch is stable . in other reference like @xcite , based on the idea of infinite time compression effects",
    ", it was suggested that ch will always be stable .",
    "the assumption of this work agreed that stability persists for only a finite though non - zero measure of the parameter space @xmath16 of the bh , infringing on the very spirit of the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis .",
    "current analysis of bh thermodynamics requires to trust on the universal symmetry arguments that follow from the analysis of @xmath17 gravity in ads space time @xcite .",
    "the microscopic degrees of freedom of the bh are described in terms of those of a conformal field theory - without gravity - living in the boundary .",
    "this construction gave the inner @xmath18 and outer @xmath19 killing horizons of bhs obeying the product formula @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are number of right and left moving excitations of the @xmath23 conformal field theory .",
    "generalizing for any asymptotically flat bh in @xmath24 - spacetime dimensions @xcite , @xmath25 in a nut shell , this says the product of areas is independent of bh mass and solely depends on the quantized charges .",
    "this suggestive general relation for bhs encouraged purely gravitational investigation of the product of area of bhs @xcite .",
    "for kerr - newman bh area - product is been investigated @xcite .",
    "contrary to the outer horizon thermodynamics , it is not very clear where the inner - horizon has any relevance for a statistical accounting of the bh entropy .",
    "first law for the inner horizon is schematically @xmath26 the reference @xcite has studied the above relation for kerr bhs and references @xcite studied the same for more generalized bh . for the sake of comparison",
    "the first law for the outer horizon is @xmath27 the minus signs in ( [ inner_horizon ] ) are due to the killing horizon vector field being spacelike inside the bh event horizon . keeping similarity to the negative energies within ergosphere , negative energy ( @xmath28 ) is assigned to the inner horizon as well .",
    "for the perturbatively unstable nature of the inner horizon one may follow @xcite .",
    "if someone considers a number of different higher curvature modifications of the einstein hilbert action , the entropy will not generally be proportional to horizon area and the product relations for the horizon areas and entropies will no longer be equivalent . according to @xcite",
    ", bh entropy can be viewed as a noether charge , it might be more natural to except that the entropy product formula , rather than the product of the areas would be the correct generalization for modification to einstein gravity . there exist(s ) such references like @xcite , where considering the holding of entropy product formula as a ` success ' , a try to find",
    "` failures ' has been taken , i.e. , where the product of the horizon entropy depends on the mass .",
    "for such ` failures ' smarr relation is modified .",
    "though there is no obvious relation between the horizon entropy products and smarr relations , but for these failing cases both are drastically modified by the presence of higher curvature terms    our motivation is to check the thermodynamic products for some higher dimentional modified gravities .",
    "einstein gauss bonnet gravity is a modification of the einstein hilbert action to include the gauss bonnet term @xmath29 here @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the ricci scalar , the ricci tensor and the riemann tensor of @xmath12 .    the action of the einstein gaussbonnet(egb hereafter ) gravity in @xmath33 dimensional space time ( @xmath34 ) can be written as @xcite ( taking @xmath35 as unit ) @xmath36,\\ ] ] @xmath37 is the coupling constant of the gb term having dimension @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the matter lagrangian where @xmath40 is the electromagnetic tensor field , @xmath41 is the vector potential .",
    "the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations obtained by varying the action ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 and @xmath46 where , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the lovelock tensor given by , @xmath49 - \\frac{1}{2 } g_{\\mu\\nu}r_{gb}\\ ] ] and @xmath50 is the electromagnetic stress tensor .",
    "the gauss bonnet lagrangian @xmath51 is only non - trivial in @xmath52 or greater , and as such , only applies to extra dimensional models . in @xmath53 and lower it reduces to a topological surface term .",
    "if we assume that there exists a charge @xmath62 at @xmath63 ( note that @xmath62 is a point charge for @xmath64 and is the charge density of a line charge for @xmath65 ) , then the vector potential may be chosen to be @xmath66 now using the maxwell equation ( [ maxweel_equation ] ) , the differential equation for @xmath67 becomes @xmath68 where the gauss law has been used to determine the integration constant .",
    "now the metric function for egb gravity , say @xmath69 can be obtained by solving the field equations ( [ egb ] ) as @xcite @xmath70.\\ ] ] for the black hole solution ( [ bh_solution ] ) in gb theory , the horizons correspond to @xmath69 and we obtain @xmath71,\\ ] ] where this @xmath72 sign corresponds to event horizon @xmath73 and the @xmath74 sign corresponds to cauchy horizon @xmath75.this is to be followed that the radii of horizons are independent of the coupling parameter @xmath37 .",
    "egb gravity is the most simple non - trivial example of lovelock gravity .",
    "we want to investigate the thermodynamic product of a bh lying in egb gravity . in the next parts of this letter",
    "we will calculate different thermodynamic products and analyse the stability of such bhs . at the end",
    "we will conclude what we have done .",
    "the temperature of the bh is given by @xmath82 @xmath83 so this is depending on mass of bh and hence is not a global property .",
    "the free energy will take the form @xmath84 this , like temperature is not a global property . now proceeding towards heat capacity , we find @xmath85",
    "so the product is @xmath86 which is depending upon the mass @xmath12 of the bh again and is not a global property .",

    "@xmath99 the value of @xmath94 remains always negative , i.e. , the part of bh surrounded by ch is always unstable . here",
    "if we increase @xmath12 gradually , @xmath94 is a increasing function at first then after reaching a local maxima it decreases . if @xmath101 , even temperature and @xmath94 for both event horizon and ch will become independent of mass",
    "in existing literatures @xcite , it was already found that modified gravity bhs are thermodynamically unstable on a long run specially when they are large .",
    "the same result is established here .",
    "but the space time confined within event horizon is stable when radius of event horizon is small .",
    "latter a second order phase transition makes them unstable .",
    "however , as we stated this is not a new statement in the study of modified gravity bh thermodynamics .",
    "but if we follow the space time confined inside ch , this is unstable if bh is positively charged and there is a possibility to have ever stable part confined in ch if this is negatively charged .",
    "this case is not symmetric with @xmath62(we mean symmetric with @xmath102 plane ) .",
    "rather these are @xmath103 rotational image of each other .",
    "this some how says positively charged part inside ch is turbulent more than the negatively charged one . about the thermodynamic product part , the entropy(i.e . , the area ) of egb bhs are global .",
    "it is a characteristic property of string models that the entropy is the sum of contributions from left and right moving excitations of the string .",
    "the bh geometry exhibits an analogous structure .",
    "standard thermodynamic variables which are defined at the outer event horizons , are mirrored by an independent set of thermodynamic variables , defined at the inner event horizon@xcite . again from ( [ entropy_product ] ) it is to be followed for integral/ rational values of @xmath62 , @xmath104 can not be represented as sum/ subtraction of two integers . if we were able to do so , we could have say that the terms , sum of which is @xmath104 , are contributions from left and right moving modes .",
    "this again could have been treated as a notification towards a weak interaction of these two kind of modes . as we are considering five dimensions ,",
    "our entropy is the third order of the radii .",
    "this makes it irrational .",
    "here we can say that the interaction is not weak .",
