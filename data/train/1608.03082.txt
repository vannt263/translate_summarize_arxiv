    "a futuristic application is to use the mechanical resonator as a bus to couple two remote qubits@xcite    mechanical resonators can be constructed on the micro- or nano - scale from various solid - state materials such as silicon nitride@xcite , silica@xcite , silicon@xcite , diamond@xcite , gaas@xcite , and so on .",
    "position read - out of the mechanical resonator is usually carried out by incorporating the mechanical resonator in an optical cavity@xcite .",
    "we pursue an alternative here , position read - out by embedding a single photon emitter into the mechanical resonator itself .",
    "gaas is a natural choice of material for this endeavour . on the one hand ,",
    "gaas mechanical resonators are easy to make and have good mechanical properties@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a self - assembled quantum dot in gaas represents an excellent single photon emitter . at low temperature with resonant excitation ,",
    "a quantum dot is a fast , bright@xcite and pure@xcite source of single photons , outperforming any other solid - state emitter .",
    "a crucial feature is that the quantum dot transition frequency is sensitive to the strain produced by a deformation of the host material : there is an inherent coupling between the mechanics and the single photon emitter@xcite .",
    "a recent insight is that semiconductor nano - wires have both mechanical resonances _ and _ an optimized photon collection efficiency@xcite .",
    "the quantum dot ( qd)mechanical coupling manifests itself as a time - dependent frequency shift of the qd transition as the resonator oscillates , whose amplitude is determined by the hybrid opto - mechanical coupling @xmath0@xcite ( fig .  [ figure1]a and c ) .",
    "this is described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath1 where the pauli operator @xmath2 acts on the qd two - level system , @xmath3 is the operator representing the microwire s displacement , and @xmath4 corresponds to the quantum zero - point fluctuations . in previous experiments@xcite , external driving of the mechanical resonator was used to demonstrate a coupling @xmath0 of order 100 khz , much less than the spontaneous emission rate , of order 1 ghz .",
    "a high quality qd inside such a resonator can thus be used to perform a sensitive read - out of the mechanical displacement . however , previous experiments employed non - resonant excitation which produces photons of low quality ( as inferred from a large spectral linewidth and low indistinguishability ) such that the displacement read - out via the qd photoluminescence would have been subject to a large amount of noise .",

    "[ figure1]e .",
    "the qd emits photons preferentially into the one - dimensional waveguide mode defined by the nanowire .",
    "the mode then expands adiabatically by the inverse taper , allowing very large couplings to a gaussian mode in free - space , resulting in very large photon extraction efficiencies .",
    "we exploit both features to detect thermal excitation of the mechanical resonances even at 4 k by measuring the fluctuations in the single photon count rate .",
    "the results open the way to adding and removing phonons to the mechanical oscillator via resonant optical driving of the qd .",
    "the results demonstrate a new approach to displacement read - out : the use of an embedded single photon emitter .",
    "in fact we show that the heisenberg limit can be achieved in the limit of a perfect emitter ( transform - limited linewidth , weak driving , 100% collection efficiency ) , a regime within reach experimentally .",
    "to read - out the displacement of the mechanical resonator , we drive the optical transition of an embedded qd with a narrow band laser and collect the scattered light , the resonance fluorescence ( rf ) .",
    "a displacement @xmath5 of the mechanical oscillator results in a detuning of the qd with respect to the constant frequency laser and translates into a change @xmath6 in the detected rf count rate . assuming small optical detunings due to the mechanical oscillation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 depends on the spectral profile of the emitter .",
    "in addition to the large opto - mechanical couplings and high photon extraction efficiency , the photonic trumpet has a further advantage : the large top facet serves as a  landing pad \" for the excitation beam and allows for excellent suppression of the back - scattered light from the resonant laser .",
    "we focus on a @xmath9 m long photonic trumpet , featuring a bottom diameter of @xmath10 nm and a top facet diameter of @xmath11 m. the wire is clamped to a bottom gold - silica mirror via a flip - chip procedure . the typical spectrum from a qd inside such a wire",

    "we observe a maximum as the second laser hits the qd resonance ( @xmath12 ) , on top of a photoluminescence background associated with the non - resonant pump .",

    "because of the inherent non - linearity of the two - level system , the contribution from the back - action may remain negligible and hard to detect .",

    "we then find a similar to standard cavity opto - mechanics experiments in the sense that , at the sql , and for @xmath160 , the back - action and the imprecision contribute equally to the noise , and the total added noise equals the zero - point fluctuations ( fig .",

    "the situation is however more complex when the qd environment is processed below the micro - meter scale : a small object in the focus of the incident laser causes depolarization of the reflected beam and prevents efficient rejection . to reconcile the nano - scale engineering of the qd surrounding with the need for a flat top facet",

    "this yields the following equation to describe the experimental data @xmath183 which only depends on @xmath0 .      throughout the analysis",
    ", it has been assumed that the exciton dephasing associated with the opto - mechanical coupling is negligible , such that it does not contribute to the broadening of the qd linewidth .",
    "this assumption , which allows here for an analytical theory to be developed ( see eq .  [ dxdnrelation ] ) , is also important in the context of quantum optics experiments with such devices .",
    "indeed , the coupling to mechanical modes introduces additional noise , which leads to a broadening of the qd transitions for integration times longer than the mechanical oscillation period .    the energy shift induced by the brownian fluctuations of the microwire",

    ", we allow a @xmath190 variation on the length of the wire ( due to flux inhomogeneities over the wafer surface in the mbe chamber ) . to account for the observed splitting of the first flexural mode",

    "the different spectral signature is attributed to a different location of the qd in the microwire . in particular",

    "the idea is that each mode produces a specific strain at a given location in the wire . by comparing the relative amplitude of the measured resonances , it is possible to extract the qd position . in our case ,",
    "the situation is simplified by the fact that we already know the precise location of the qd layer in the z - direction .",
    "the procedure goes as follows .",
    "we first simulate the strain per unit displacement for various radial positions of the qd at a fixed distance of @xmath198 nm from the base . for each mode",

    "we observe that for all modes except b@xmath52 , the strain @xmath200 in the vertical direction dominates over the other components .",

    "together with the same approximations as in section [ description of the hybrid coupling ] ( linear interaction hamiltonian , small frequency shifts ) , this results in @xmath204 .",
    "we thus determine the qd position by adjusting position of the qd , calculating the relative amplitudes of the different modes and making a comparison with the result from the experimental data .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figures8 ] b for four different radial positions of the qd along the @xmath44-axis . in a second step , we vary the angle to account for the different weights of the two orthogonal modes f@xmath187 and f@xmath205 , fig .",

    "finally , using an iterative process , we are able to determine the qd position within the qd plane modulo a symmetry versus the @xmath44 and @xmath206 axes ( this experiment does not resolve positive and negative coordinates ) .",
