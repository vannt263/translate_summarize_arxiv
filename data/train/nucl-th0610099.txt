    "one of the most fascinating challenges of nuclear physics is the description of nuclear matter and nuclei starting from quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "even if important progress have been made in qcd calculations on the lattice , such a description is not yet available .",
    "models incorporating the most prominent features of qcd have to be used .",
    "quark models , like , for example , the quark - meson coupling model@xcite which describes nuclear matter as non overlapping nucleon mit bags interacting through the self - consistent exchange of meson fields directly coupled to the quarks , or the model of bentz and thomas@xcite where the nucleons are generated as quark - diquark states in a nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with an infrared cutoff to simulate the confinement , are gaining more and more success in shedding some light on the dynamical behaviour of nucleons in nuclei .    on the other hand , starting directly at the hadronic level , kohn - sham - like density functional theories with constraints on the energy functional coming from low energy qcd , like that developed by finelli , kaiser , vretenar and weise@xcite , lead to an accurate description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "another possibility is to apply the strategy of effective field theories where low energy effective hadronic lagrangians are obtained by integrating out the degrees of freedom lying above the energy scale considered .",
    "this decimation leads to density - dependent masses and couplings in the hadronic lagrangian @xcite",
    ". this density - dependence should reflect essentially the underlying dynamics of the quarks .",
    "such a lagrangian with density dependent masses and coupling constants determined according to brown and rho scaling@xcite has been proposed by brown , song , min and rho@xcite .",
    "the calculation reported in @xcite , assuming a scaling law leading to a decreasing of the vector meson mass of approximately 20% at saturation , enables a realistic description of bulk properties of nuclear matter .",
    "recently , new experimental results for the in - medium @xmath0 meson mass would suggest a small decreasing of approximately 10 - 15% at saturation density . in particular , the taps collaboration @xcite found an in - medium mass of @xmath1 mev at 0.6 times the saturation density ( which is compatible with a 14% dropping at saturation when a linear density - dependence is assumed ) in photoproduction experiments and naruki et al .",
    "@xcite found a 9% decrease of the in - medium @xmath0 mass at saturation in 12 gev proton - nucleus reactions .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of obtaining a realistic description of bulk properties of nuclear matter in the model of brown , song , min and rho @xcite with a density dependence of the in - medium @xmath0 mass in accordance with recent experimental indications .",
    "in addition , in order to allow deviations from the brown and rho scaling , the hadron masses and the density dependence of the coupling constants have been deduced directly from the quark dynamics using an in - medium njl model .",
    "we have chosen here to use the njl model @xcite since , despite some shortcomings like the lack of confinement , with its dynamical quark mass generation and the in - medium chiral symmetry restoration , it allows to take into account an important part of quark dynamics .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall the formalism of the effective hadronic model with density - dependent couplings and masses used to determine bulk properties of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the section 3 will be devoted to the determination of density dependences for hadron masses and meson couplings from a njl model .",
    "we present and discuss numerical results in section 4 , where some nuclear matter bulk properties ( saturation point , incompressibility , nucleon effective mass ... ) are presented .",
    "we conclude in section 5 .",
    "we use an effective hadronic lagrangian similar to that used by brown , song , min and rho @xcite .",
    "it is formally identical to the walecka one@xcite but with density - dependent masses and couplings , which reflect the underlying physics induced by the quark dynamics :    @xmath2 \\psi   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial _",
    "{ \\mu } \\phi \\partial ^{\\mu } \\phi -m_{\\sigma } ^{*2}\\phi ^{2})+\\frac{1}{2}m_{\\omega } ^{*2}v_{\\mu } v^{\\mu } -\\frac{1}{4}% f_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu } ,   \\label{lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent respectively the nucleon , @xmath6 and @xmath7 meson fields and , as usual , @xmath8 .",
    "this lagrangian contains only two free - parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which will be adjusted at the end of the calculation to reproduce the position of the saturation point .",
    "as already indicated , the density - dependent @xmath11 functions and mass parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , would contain information coming from the quark level .",
    "the problem is now to determine these quantities in such a manner they reflect the underlying quark dynamics as better as possible .",
    "if a fully satisfactory description of nucleons and nuclear matter from quark and gluon fields would be available , this stage of calculation would be unnecessary since the fields and parameters entering @xmath15 could be expressed directly from the quark level ones .",
    "however , it is not actually the case and approximations have still to be made .",
    "for example , in their work , brown , song , min and rho @xcite have presupposed a density dependence of the lagrangian parameters in accordance with brown and rho scaling . in the present exploratory work ,",
    "we have chosen to assume for the values of the masses and couplings the same baryonic density dependence as that which would be obtained in quark matter for the same density .",
    "as explained in the next section , we have used for this job a njl model .",
    "obviously , in the real world , quark matter can not exist at low temperatures and densities but we expect that , despite some shortcomings , the approximation used is not so bad since we have verified that , for example , the density dependence of the quark condensate obtained is very similar to that obtained in ref@xcite using a quark - diquark description of the nucleons in nuclear matter .    in the rest frame of symmetric nuclear matter , the equation for the nucleon field in mean - field approximation is : @xmath16 \\psi = 0 ,   \\label{eqn}\\ ] ] where the scalar and vector classical fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be obtained from the lagrange equations :    @xmath19    @xmath20    with the scalar and baryonic nuclear densities , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , defined as usual as @xmath23 @xmath24 for each value of the baryonic density , @xmath25 will be determined self - consistently by minimizing the energy density @xmath26 ( eq.[eps ] ) with respect to @xmath25 . in eq.[eqn ] , @xmath27 represents the rearrangement term given by :    @xmath28    expression in which @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 are functions of @xmath22 . as in the standard walecka model@xcite , eq.[eqn ] is equivalent to the dirac equation for a nucleon of mass : @xmath31    note that the vector potential @xmath32 is given by : @xmath33    as usual , the energy - density @xmath34 , pressure @xmath35 and incompressibility parameter @xmath36 can be obtained from the energy - momentum tensor , providing , for fermi momentum @xmath37 : @xmath38 ,   \\label{eps}\\ ] ]    @xmath39 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 in symmetric nuclear matter . as already proved by brown",
    ", song , min and rho @xcite , the thermodynamical consistency holds , whatever the density dependence used in eq.[lag ] , as long as the rearrangement terms ( eq.[rea ] ) are not forgotten .",
    "we consider the following chirally invariant two - flavor njl lagrangian@xcite :    @xmath43 q+g_{1}\\left [ ( \\overline{q}q)^{2}+(\\overline{q}i\\gamma _ { 5}{\\bf \\tau } % q)^{2}\\right ] -g_{2}(\\overline{q}\\gamma _ { \\mu } q)^{2 }   \\label{njl } \\\\ & & + g_{3}\\left [ ( \\overline{q}q)^{2}+(\\overline{q}i\\gamma _ { 5}{\\bf \\tau } % q)^{2}\\right ] ( \\overline{q}\\gamma _ { \\mu } q)^{2 } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 denotes the quark field with two flavor ( @xmath45 ) and three color ( @xmath46 ) degrees of freedom and @xmath47 is the diagonal matrix of the current quark masses ( here in the isospin symmetric case ) .",
    "the second and third terms of eq.[njl ] represent local four - quark interactions while the later one is an eight - quark interaction . as explained in section 4 , the eight - quark term , while contributing very weakly to the energy ,",
    "is essential here because its influence on the density dependences of the hadronic lagrangian ( eq.[lag ] ) enables to stabilize nuclear matter .",
    "in fact , this term provides an additional density dependence of the lagrangian parameters which is important for the scalar polarizability of the nucleon .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a stabilizing effect has already been reported by bentz and thomas@xcite in a quite different context , and by mishustin et al . in a nucleonic njl model @xcite .",
    "other high - order interaction terms could be added to the lagrangian [ njl ] .",
    "the effect of some of them is actually under consideration but , in this exploratory work , only that appearing in [ njl ] will be taken into account .",
    "the dirac equation for a quark in mean - field approximation is given by :    @xmath48 q=0 ,   \\label{dir}\\ ] ]    which defines a dynamical constituent - quark mass :    @xmath49    generated by a strong scalar interaction of the quark with the qcd vacuum . in the gap equation ( eq.[gap ] ) , the quark condensate @xmath50 can be written as :    @xmath51    where here tr denotes traces over color , flavor and spin . in eq.[qqbs ] , @xmath52 represents the in - medium quark propagator defined as :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the quark fermi momentum .",
    "it has to be noted that we are working in quark matter in the njl model .",
    "the baryonic density is related to the total quark density by @xmath58 .",
    "the quark condensate is divergent due to the loop integrals and requires an appropriate regularization procedure . as many authors@xcite",
    ", we introduce a three - momentum cutoff @xmath59 which has the least impact on medium parts of the regularized integrals , in particular at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "in fact , since the model is non renormalisable , the cut - off @xmath60 is just an additional parameter .",
    "thus , after the regularization procedure , the quark condensate is given at each density by :    @xmath61    self - consistent equation which is equivalent to a minimization of the energy density of quark matter with respect to the quark condensate .",
    "as usual , the mesons will be obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equation in the quark - antiquark channel .",
    "since this is the standard procedure , we will only list the results which are needed later on .",
    "first , we define the quark - antiquark polarization operator in the @xmath62 channel by :    @xmath63 ,   \\label{pola}\\ ] ]    where the vertex @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 stand for respectively the pion , sigma and omega mesons .",
    "note that , in the vector channel , the lorentz structure of the polarization operator is @xmath67 .",
    "the in - medium meson masses , @xmath68 , and meson - quark - quark coupling constants , @xmath69 , are then determined by the pole structure of the @xmath70-matrix , i.e. by the conditions :    @xmath71    @xmath72 _ { q^{2}=m_{m}^{*2}}^{-1 } ,   \\label{res}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively for the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath0 mesons .",
    "note that for the determination of the polarization operator ( eq.[pola ] ) , we have used the same regularization procedure as for the quark condensate .    in the scalar channel ,",
    "the polarization is given by :    @xmath78    with    @xmath79    in the vector channel , one obtains :    @xmath80    we also need the pion mass and decay constant to adjust the model parameters . in the pseudo - scalar channel , the polarization reads :    @xmath81    and the pion decay constant is :    @xmath82      we now have to define how the density dependences of the hadronic lagrangian parameters ( eq . [ lag ] ) are deduced from quantities calculated in njl model .",
    "first , for every value of the baryonic density , the @xmath0 and @xmath77 meson masses @xmath83 , @xmath84 are taken directly from the njl calculation ( eq . [ pol ] ) in which the value of the quark condensate has been obtained solving eq.[qqb ] .",
    "second , we have to determine @xmath85 .",
    "even if progress have been made ( see for example @xcite ) , a realistic description of the nucleon in a njl model is still an open problem . here",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath12 is directly related to the quark condensate , with the same relation as found in finite - density qcd sum - rule calculations@xcite . to leading order , which should be valid at densities below and around the saturation density of nuclear matter , one has then :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the value of the quark condensate at baryonic density @xmath88 obtained by solving eq.[qqb ] , @xmath89 is the same quantity in vacuum and @xmath90 mev is the free nucleon mass .",
    "it was predicted in @xcite that the dependence of the vector - meson mass on the quark condensate should change around saturation from approximately @xmath91 below saturation to @xmath87 above .",
    "the dynamical processes leading to this change would probably also affect the nucleon mass at the same density .",
    "however , since in this work we are interested only in densities below and around saturation , we have assumed that eq .",
    "[ sumr ] remains valid at every density considered .",
    "third , in a simple @xmath92 counting in a naive quark model , the quark - meson and nucleon - meson couplings in vacuum are proportional , as argued in @xcite . at low densities",
    ", it seems quite reasonable to assume that the same relation holds approximately .",
    "such a proportionality holds also , for example , in the qmc model@xcite .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath29 functions entering in the hadronic lagrangian would thus be taken as : @xmath93    @xmath94    where @xmath95 , @xmath96 and their values in vacuum @xmath97 , @xmath98 , are obtained from eq.[res ] with the value of the quark condensate which minimizes the energy density of quark matter .",
    "at the quark level , we have to fix five parameters for the njl model : the cutoff @xmath59 , the bare quark mass @xmath47 , and the coupling constants @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for a given value of the cutoff @xmath59",
    ", we need four constraints . as usual , the pion mass @xmath102 mev , the pion decay constant @xmath103 mev and the @xmath7 meson mass @xmath104 mev in vacuum are used .",
    "since the eight - quark term has been introduced in order to stabilize nuclear matter , at least one in - medium physical quantity should be constrained in the fitting procedure .",
    "we have chosen here to take into account the recent result obtained by the taps collaboration@xcite for the @xmath7 meson mass in nuclei , @xmath105 ( stat)@xmath106(syst ) mev ( where @xmath107 is the saturation density of nuclear matter ) .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath108 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are obtained by fitting the pion and the @xmath7 meson properties in vacuum and the in - medium @xmath7 meson mass @xmath109 mev .",
    "we have verified that the results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar if we choose another constraint on the in - medium @xmath0 mass in accordance with the recent experimental data of naruki et al.@xcite on 12 gev proton - nucleus reactions . with these constraints ,",
    "the cutoff @xmath60 can not be unambiguously determined and , as often done , we have considered here several different values . +      on the other hand , at the hadronic level , @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been determined to reproduce the empirical saturation point of nuclear matter , i.e. , @xmath110 mev and @xmath111 at @xmath112 @xmath113 .    for each value of @xmath60 considered , in order to probe",
    "the description of nuclear matter obtained , we have calculated several physical quantities : the effective nucleon mass @xmath114 , the incompressibility parameter @xmath36 and the slope of the real part of the energy dependence of the nucleon - nucleus optical potential @xmath115 at saturation . for the compressibility of nuclear matter , the main information comes from the energies of the monopolar modes over many nuclei .",
    "the commonly accepted value @xmath116 mev , has been deduced by blaizot@xcite , in the framework of non - relativistic hartree - fock rpa models with effective interactions . in a relativistic framework , it has been shown@xcite that some effective lagrangians leading to higher values of the incompressibility ( close to @xmath117 mev ) could predict correctly the isoscalar giant resonance energies in medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "thus , we can estimate that a realistic value of the incompressibility parameter should be in the interval : @xmath118 mev . concerning the effective nucleon mass , furnstahl , rusnak and serot@xcite",
    "have shown that for models without isoscalar tensor coupling , there is a strong correlation between the value of the nucleon effective mass at saturation density and the spin - orbit splitting in nuclei .",
    "they found that , to accurately reproduce the empirical splittings , one requires a value of @xmath119 between @xmath120 and @xmath121 at saturation density .",
    "finally , the slope of the energy dependence of the real part of the nucleon - nucleus optical potential , which in a relativistic mean - field approximation is @xmath122 , has been extracted@xcite from experimental data@xcite and has been found to be equal to @xmath123 in ref.@xcite and @xmath124 in ref.@xcite , up to @xmath125 mev of incident kinetic energy , at saturation .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that realistic values of @xmath115 should lie between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "each value of @xmath60 corresponds to a value of the constituent quark mass in vacuum , and we have thus chosen to display the results as functions of @xmath128 instead of @xmath60 . with the constraints chosen here at the quark level , the saturation point can not be reproduced for @xmath129 mev .",
    "we have plotted on fig.1 the dimensionless nucleon effective mass @xmath119 , the incompressibility parameter @xmath36 and the slope of the energy dependence of the real part of the nucleon - nucleus optical potential @xmath115 at saturation as functions of @xmath128 .",
    "the shaded areas correspond to the bounds on the empirical values .",
    "as we can see , for @xmath130 @xmath131 mev ( @xmath132 mev ) , the three physical quantities @xmath119 , @xmath36 and @xmath115 are all in good agreement with the empirical values , and keep reasonable values at least up to @xmath133 mev .    as an example , we have chosen to consider the central value @xmath134 mev represented by the vertical dashed line in fig.1 .",
    "the parameters of the njl model are then @xmath135 mev , @xmath136 mev , @xmath137 gev@xmath138 , @xmath139 gev@xmath138 and @xmath140 gev@xmath141 . at the hadronic level ,",
    "the values of the coupling constants are @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the saturation curve for symmetric nuclear matter is shown on fig.2 .",
    "the values obtained for the effective nucleon mass , the incompressibility parameter and the slope of the optical potential at saturation are @xmath144 , @xmath145 mev , and @xmath146 .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "first , the value of the @xmath101 parameter is such that @xmath147 providing an eight - quark term which contributes only for 2% of the constituent quark mass at saturation ( see eq.[gap ] ) .",
    "however , this contribution is essential for stabilizing the system . with @xmath148",
    ", nuclear matter would saturate with an unrealistically weak effective nucleon mass at saturation density ( @xmath149 30% of the free nucleon mass ) .",
    "the eight quark term tends to smooth the curvature of the quark condensate ( and that of @xmath85 in this model ) with respect to density .",
    "the sensitivity of the model to this term can be understood as follows .",
    "the saturation is resulting as a compensation between the scalar , vector and rearrangement term ( eq . [ sigma0 ] ) contributions in pressure , and the rearrangement term is very sensitive to the derivatives of the masses and couplings with respect to density .",
    "the additional density dependence produces a variation of the @xmath150 term of about 40@xmath151 at saturation .",
    "so , the difference between @xmath152 and @xmath153 lies principally in the modification of the derivatives of the masses and couplings rather than of these functions themselves .",
    "second , at the quark level , the model provides a quark condensate in the vacuum @xmath154 mev in good agreement with the lattice calculations : @xmath155 mev@xcite .",
    "third , the constituent quark mass in vacuum is relatively large .",
    "this value is appreciably larger than one third of the free nucleon mass , but since this quantity is not an observable , it should be model - dependent . note that such large values are commonly considered in recent njl calculations",
    "( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a large value has also been obtained@xcite in a njl model including meson loop corrections generated via a @xmath156 expansion of the self - energy in the next to leading order , with parameters constrained by the experimental data on the electromagnetic form factor @xmath157 in the time - like region .",
    "such a large mass does nt prevent from obtaining a good description of the baryonic spectrum , for example using a quark - diquark model as done in ref @xcite .",
    "moreover , a large quark mass prevents the omega meson to be unstable against decay into a quark - antiquark pair since @xmath14 is always lower than @xmath158 for each density .",
    "fourth , one can see on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the saturation curve is rather hard at densities above @xmath159 .",
    "this can be due to the fact that @xmath85 , taken here proportional to the quark condensate , is decreasing too fast at high densities .",
    "this could be compensated , for example , by introducing perturbatively higher order terms in the scalar and vector fields , as done in @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the properties of nuclear matter in a relativistic mean field model with density - dependent masses and couplings , similar to that used in @xcite , in which we have replaced the brown and rho scaling by a direct calculation of meson masses and couplings in a njl quark model .",
    "the njl model including four and eight quark interaction terms has been constrained to reproduce the recent taps result for the in medium @xmath0 meson mass in addition to the vacuum pion and @xmath0 meson properties . at the hadronic level , the two free parameters have been fixed to reproduce the empirical saturation point .    at the quark level ,",
    "the eight quark term is essential for obtaining realistic saturation properties . at saturation ,",
    "the nucleon effective mass , the incompressibility parameter and the slope of the energy dependence of the nucleon - nucleus optical potential obtained are all in good agreement with the empirical data .",
    "even if more work is needed in this direction and in a more fundamental one , this result is a very encouraging one since with only a few free - parameters , a realistic description of saturation properties of nuclear matter has been obtained from a hadronic lagrangian constrained by a quark model which reproduces vacuum and in - medium meson properties ."
