    "their statistical analysis is of fundamental importance in understanding the formation and evolution history of galaxies . actually , recent large high-@xmath7 galaxy catalogs allow one to estimate their luminosity functions and spatial correlation functions at different @xmath7 with a reasonable accuracy ( e.g. , steidel et al .  1999 ; adelberger et al .  1998 ;",

    "in the standard scenario of structure formation , it is thought that dark matter halos are first formed via the gravitational amplification of initial small density fluctuations .",
    "subsequently baryonic gas trapped in a gravitational potential of the dark matter halo becomes sufficiently dense to cool and to form stars , and such initially small systems experience repeated mergers to form larger galaxies .",
    "the formation process of halos is determined by gravity only , thus it is well understood from @xmath8-body simulations and also from simple but relevant analytical approximations such as the press - schechter model ( press & schechter , 1974 ) and its extensions ( bond et al .  1991",
    "; bower 1991 ; lacy & cole 1993 ; mo & white 1996 ; sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ; sheth & tormen 2002 ) . the formation of _ galaxies _ , on the other hand , involves many complicated processes including hydrodynamics , radiative processes , star formation , and supernova feedback , and thus it is hard to solve in a reliable manner even using state - of - the - art numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , a simplified or empirical model that describes essential physical processes is still a valuable tool to understand basic elements of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "this is why we attempt in what follows to apply an empirical parameterized model that relates the galaxy number distribution to mass of the hosting dark matter halo . to be more specific ,",
    "we explore statistical relations between two populations of high-@xmath7 galaxies and their hosting dark matter halos : ( i ) lyman break galaxies ( hereafter lbgs ) which are isolated in a color  color diagram due to their uv continuum depression ( steidel et al .  1996 ; 1998 ;",

    "we consider three catalogs generated from the subaru deep field survey data ( ouchi et al .",
    "2001 , 2003a ; shimasaku et al .",
    "2003 ) ; lbgs at @xmath0 , lbgs at @xmath1 and laes at @xmath10 .",
    "the major purpose of our current analysis is twofold ; the first is to clarify the difference of hosting halos for lbgs and laes .",
    "it is well known that these two populations exhibit different statistical properties , including the fact that laes are in general fainter and smaller , and are more strongly clustered than lbgs ( ouchi et al .",
    "these differences should retain information of their formation processes as well as environmental effects .",
    "the second is to examine the difference between lbgs located at different redshifts ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "combined with the previous analysis of lbgs at @xmath13 by moustakas & somerville ( 2001 ) and bullock et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , our results would provide better understanding of the evolution of lbgs .    for those purposes",
    ", we employ the halo approach that attempts to model the spatial distribution of galaxies in a parameterized fashion .",
    "the key quantity in this approach is the halo occupation function ( hof ) that describes statistical relations between galaxies and their hosting halos .",
    "we adopt a simple form for hof motivated by the semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( benson et al .  2000 ;",
    "kauffmann et al .  1999 ) as well as by hydrodynamic simulations ( yoshikawa et al .",
    "2001 ; white , hernquist & springel 2002 ) .",
    "combined with models of the halo mass function and spatial clustering of halos , for which very accurate fitting functions are obtained from @xmath8-body simulations ( jing 1998 ; sheth & tormen 1999 ; hamana et al .",
    "2001 ; jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ) , the halo approach predicts the spatial clustering of galaxies as well as their number density ( mo & fukugita 1996 ; mo , mao & white 1999 ) . comparing these predictions with the observed values , we obtain constraints on the relation between galaxies and their hosting halo mass for different populations of galaxies .",
    "the latter methodology was first attempted by jing & suto ( 1998 ) for lbgs at @xmath13 using their halo catalogs from @xmath8-body simulations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes models and basic equations .",
    "section 3 summarizes observational data that are used to put constraints on the model parameters . in section 4 ,",
    "our results of lbgs at @xmath0 and @xmath12 are presented and are compared with previous results of @xmath14 lbgs ( moustakas & somerville 2001 ; bullock et al .",
    "we show results of laez5 , and discuss their implications in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion . in appendix",
    ", we illustrate how the hof parameters depend on the shape of the two - point correlation function .    throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt a flat @xmath15cdm ( cold dark matter ) cosmology with the matter density @xmath16 , the cosmological constant @xmath17 , the hubble constant @xmath18km / s / mpc with @xmath19 , and the normalization of the matter power spectrum @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the fitting function of the cdm power spectrum of bardeen et al .",
    "the basic idea behind the halo model that we adopt below has a long history ( neyman & scott 1952 ; limber 1953 ; peebles 1974 , 1980 ; mcclelland & silk 1977 ; and other recent papers referred to in this section ) .",
    "the model predictions have been significantly improved with the recent accurate models for the mass function , the biasing and the density profile of dark matter halos ( seljak 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; ma & fry 2000 ) .",
    "this approach has been applied to various problems in cosmological nonlinear clustering , galaxy clustering and weak lensing correlation ( e.g. , sheth & jain 1997 ; jing , mo & brner 1998 ; komatsu & kitayama 1999 ; cooray , hu & miralda - escude 2000 ; cooray & sheth 2002 ; scoccimarro et al .  2001 ;",

    "we summarize several expressions which are most relevant to the current analysis .",
    "in particular , we mainly follow the modeling of berlind & weinberg ( 2002 ) , bullock et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and moustakas & somerville ( 2002 ) in which readers may find further details .",
    "we adopt a simple parametric form for the average number of a given galaxy population as a function of the hosting halo mass : @xmath21 the above statistical and empirical relation is the essential ingredient in the current modeling characterized by the minimum mass of halos which host the population of galaxies ( @xmath22 ) , a normalization parameter which can be interpreted as the critical mass above which halos typically host more than one galaxy ( @xmath23 ; note that @xmath23 may exceed @xmath22 since the above relation represents the statistically expected value of the number of galaxies ) , and the power - law index of the mass dependence of the efficiency of galaxy formation ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we will put constraints on the three parameters from the observed number density and clustering amplitude for each galaxy population . in short ,",
    "the number density of galaxies is most sensitive to @xmath23 which changes the average number of galaxies per halo .",
    "the clustering amplitude on large angular scales ( @xmath24 ) is determined by the hosting halos and thus very sensitive to the mass of those halos , @xmath22 .",
    "the clustering on smaller scales , on the other hand , depends on those three parameters in a fairly complicated fashion ; roughly speaking , @xmath25 changes the amplitude , @xmath9 , and to a lesser extent @xmath23 as well , changes the slope ( see appendix ) .",
    "further detailed discussion may be found in berlind & weinberg ( 2002 ) , bullock et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and moustakas & somerville ( 2002 ) .    with the above relation",
    ", the number density of the corresponding galaxy population at redshift @xmath7 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the halo mass function for which we adopt the fitting function of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "the galaxy two - point correlation function on small scales is dominated by contributions of galaxy pairs located in the same halo .",
    "we adopt the following model ( bullock et al .",
    "2002 ) for the mean number of galaxy pairs @xmath28 within a halo of mass @xmath29 : @xmath30 the above empirical model is motivated by previous results from the semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( benson et al .",
    "2000 ; kauffmann et al .  1999 ) which indicate that for @xmath31 the scatter around the mean number of galaxies is poissonian , while for @xmath32 it becomes sub - poissonian .    in the framework of the halo model ,",
    "the galaxy power spectrum consists of two contributions , one from galaxy pairs located in the same halo ( 1-halo term ) and the other from galaxy pairs located in two different halos ( 2-halo term ) : @xmath33 assuming the linear halo bias model ( mo & white 1996 ) , the 2-halo term reduces to @xmath34 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the linear dark matter power spectrum , @xmath36 is the halo bias factor ( we adopt the modified fitting function of sheth & tormen 1999 ) , and @xmath37 is the fourier transform of the halo dark matter profile normalized by its mass , @xmath38 .",
    "see , e.g. , section 3 of seljak ( 2000 ) for details . here",
    "we assume that galaxies in halos trace the density profile of the underlying dark halos by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ; 1997 ) , and adopt the mass - concentration parameter relation by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but with an appropriate correction ( see shimizu et al .",
    "2003 ) . since the clustering on large scales",
    "is dominated by the 2-halo term , it is fairly insensitive to the assumption of galaxy distribution inside the hosting halo ( berlind & weinberg 2002 ) .",
    "it should be noted that since @xmath39 on large scales ( e.g. , scales much larger than the virial radius of halos ) , on such scales the 2-halo term can be rewritten by @xmath40 where the galaxy number weighted bias factor is defined by @xmath41 note that @xmath42 depends on @xmath9 .",
    "the 1-halo term is written as @xmath43 we choose @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ( seljak 2000 ) .",
    "here we assume that in the limit of a small number of galaxies in one halo , one galaxy is located near the center of the halo .",
    "therefore , in this case , the number of pairs is dominated by the central galaxy paired with a halo galaxy , and thus the probability of finding a galaxy pair is given by the single density profile of the galaxies within a halo .",
    "once the power spectrum of the galaxy population is specified , one can easily compute their angular two - point correlation function via the limber projection ( see e.g , chapter 2 of bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) : @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the normalized selection function and @xmath50 is the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind . for the spatially flat cosmology ( @xmath51 ) as we consider throughout the present paper , the radial function @xmath52 is equivalent to @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the radial comoving distance given by @xmath55 the dependences of hof parameters on the shape of the angular two - point correlation function are summarized in appendix .    for a given selection function of the observation ,",

    "our current analysis indicates that the minimum halo mass @xmath22 for lbgs is almost the same @xmath61 at @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "the halo mass accommodating more than one galaxy , @xmath23 , seems increasing as time although barely at a 1-@xmath62 level .    the almost identical analyses by moustakas & somerville ( 2001 ) and bullock et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for @xmath14 lbgs ( steidel et al . 1998 ; adelberger et al . 1998 ; adelberger 2000 ) indicate that @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and that @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "taking account of the relatively large uncertainties in those estimates , their results are consistent with ours , and indeed the combined results may indicate an evolutionary trend of decreasing @xmath22 and increasing @xmath23 with decreasing @xmath7 .",
    "the different selection criteria at different redshifts may induce an artificial systematic effect in estimating hosting halo mass , but this is not the case here .",
    "if the limiting flux of a sample is brighter , galaxies in the sample have a smaller number density and usually a higher clustering amplitude .",
    "this leads to increasing @xmath22 and @xmath23 simultaneously .",
    "however , the limiting absolute magnitudes for lbgz3s , lbgz4s and lbgz5s are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is very unlikely that the difference in the limiting magnitude solely accounts for the systematic ( although weak ) trends in @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in summary ,",
    "the hosting halos for lbgs are characterized as follows ; ( i ) @xmath22 is about @xmath72 both at @xmath11 and @xmath6 , while it decreases to about @xmath66 at @xmath13 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath23 increases with time , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 , 4 and 3 , respectively .",
    "= 8.4 cm    let us turn to laez5s .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : angcor ] , their angular correlation function exhibits a somewhat irregular shape .",
    "this is more clearly seen in the plot of the bias ( lower panel of figure [ fig : angcor ] ) . on scales",
    "less than 120 arcsec , the bias increases with decreasing separation similarly to lbgs , and its amplitude is in the range between those for lbgz4s and lbgz5s . on the other hand ,",
    "on larger scales the bias factor is rather high , which is in a marked contrast with lbgs .",
    "the number density of laes is higher than that of lbgz5s but it has a large uncertainty , @xmath77% .",
    "it should be noted that the survey volume of laez5 is small , @xmath78 ( comoving volume ) , thus it is possible that these measurements are significantly affected by the cosmic variance .    for reference ,",
    "we give here some numbers which are useful in the following discussion ; at the redshift of laez5s , @xmath79 , 1 arcmin corresponds to @xmath80mpc ( comoving ) , and the average number of halos with the mass larger than @xmath29 within the survey volume computed from the halo mass function is @xmath81 , 10 and 1 , for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "we apply the same likelihood analysis as performed for lbgs in the last section , but we find that our simple hof prescription fails to reproduce simultaneously the observed angular correlation function and number density . indeed ,",
    "no parameter set is found to give a reasonably small @xmath85 .",
    "the most serious discrepancy is the very high correlation amplitude on scales larger than 120 arcsec . in what follows ,",
    "we present two illustrative examples of failed models , which would help to search for a possible solution of the problem . for this purpose , we plot halo model predictions for the number density of laez5s in figure [ fig : laedensity ] , in which the gray region indicates the 1-@xmath62 range of the observed number density , and halo model predictions for the large scale bias factor defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : p2h - largescale ] ) in figure [ fig : laebias ] .",
    "= 8.4 cm    = 8.4 cm    the first example is as follows ; taking the amplitude of the correlation function on large scales ( @xmath86 for @xmath87 arcsec , see figure [ fig : angcor ] ) , one finds in figure [ fig : laebias ] that @xmath88 is required irrespective of @xmath9 .",
    "this value combined with the observed number density of laez5s gives roughly @xmath89 ( or less ) for a reasonable range of @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laedensity ] ) .",
    "this parameter set , however , predicts a much higher correlation amplitude than observed on smaller scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angcor_laez5-demo1 ] ) .",
    "if one attempts to have a reasonable correlation amplitude on smaller scale , a very large @xmath23 ( more than @xmath90 at least ) is required ( see fig . [",
    "fig : angcor_laez5-demo1 ] ) , which leads to too small a number density on the other hand .",
    "one possible way to reconcile this discrepancy is to modify the halo model that we have adopted .",
    "figure [ fig : angcor_laez5-demo1 ] indicates that it is the 1-halo term that boosts the correlation amplitude on smaller scales .",
    "therefore , our assumption in the halo model that the galaxy distribution follows the dark matter distribution may not hold for laez5s . in this paper , however , we do not attempt to develop the hof model by allowing a possible variation on the galaxy distribution within halos , because the statistical accuracies of the correlation functions on small scales are still relatively low . indeed ,",
    "the number of small separation pairs is very small ; the number of lae pairs which fall into the smallest separation bin is two , and that into the second bin is five .",
    "this means that halos having more than one lae are limited , and one has to keep in mind that the correlation function measurements on these scales are based on laes in such a small number of halos .",
    "given a possible large uncertainty in the measurements of small - scale clustering , it is premature to explore an alternative model in great detail at this point .",
    "we also note that given the limited number of laez5s , it is not to be denied that their correlation signals are contaminated by the presence of the possible foreground galaxies in one or a few clusters .",
    "we must wait for future data extending over a much larger survey area .",
    "in addition to the above problem , there is another problem concerning the predicted number of halos in the survey volume .",
    "if one takes @xmath91 , the expected mean number of halos with mass larger than this value in the survey volume is @xmath92 .",
    "this suggests that there are only a few hosting halos in the survey volume .",
    "if this picture is right , it is unlikely that the 2-halo term is correctly measured from such a small number of halos .",
    "the above consideration implies that a simple halo model may not be readily applicable to the laes .",
    "note that the parameter set ( @xmath93 , @xmath23 , @xmath9)@xmath94(@xmath84 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) gives @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , if real , we can conclude at least that the nature of hosting halos and the relation between galaxies and halos for laes are very different from those for lbgs .",
    "the second example is as follows .",
    "let us ignore the data on large scales ( @xmath87 arcsec ) for a while , and adopt the value of @xmath99 around 1 arcmin , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "this gives @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laebias ] ) . this value combined with the observed number density gives roughly @xmath102 for a reasonable range of @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laedensity ] ) .",
    "this parameter set predicts a slightly higher correlation amplitude on small scales than observed as shown in figure [ fig : angcor_laez5-demo2 ] .",
    "however , this discrepancy may not be taken so seriously , because of the limited statistical significance as mentioned above .",
    "better agreement is obtained by setting larger @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angcor_laez5-demo2 ] ) , which , however , predicts a smaller number density than observed .",
    "the discrepancy in the number density becomes smaller if one takes a smaller @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laedensity ] ) . if we take ( @xmath93 , @xmath23)@xmath94(@xmath104 , @xmath105 ) , the characteristic values are @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "these values are similar to those for lbgs .",
    "the above model provides acceptable agreement with both the correlation function on scales smaller than 120 arcsec and the number density . the predicted correlation function on larger scales",
    ", however , has a much lower amplitude than observed .",
    "a possible interpretation to this discrepancy is that the current survey volume is one of the overdense regions on large scales by chance , and the laes in the region have accidentally acquired the high correlation amplitude .",
    "in fact , shimasaku et al . (",
    "2003 ) have extended the survey area of laez5s to the north and found a high overdensity of laez5s over a circular region of 5 arcmin ( 8@xmath112mpc ) radius .",
    "they have suggested that it may be a progenitor of a present - day massive cluster of galaxies .",
    "half of this circular region is inside our survey area . laez5s",
    "associated with this large - scale overdense region will have an unusually high correlation amplitude on large scales .",
    "if this is the case , the hof parameter values obtained ignoring the large - scale correlation function will be close to the typical values of laes at @xmath6 .",
    "we have analyzed three high - redshift galaxy samples created from the subaru deep field ( sdf ) survey data ; lbgs at @xmath11 ( lbgz4s ) , lbgs at @xmath6 ( lbgz5s ) and laes at @xmath79 ( laez5s ) , and explored the implications of their number density and angular clustering in the framework of the halo occupation function ( hof ) .",
    "our major findings are summarized as follows ;    \\(i ) the two lbg samples can be well described by the halo model with an appropriate hof in an approximate fashion .",
    "\\(ii ) the hosting halos for lbgz4s and lbgz5s are more massive than @xmath113 .",
    "since the expected number of lbgs per halo with @xmath114 is @xmath5 , there is an approximate one - to - one correspondence between halos and lbgs .",
    "this is basically consistent with the results previously found for lbgs at @xmath13 ( mo , fukugita 1996 ; steidel et al . 1998 ; jing & suto 1998 moustakas & somerville 2001 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; bullock et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) on the other hand , this may also indicate that a large fraction of dark halos do not host lbgs brighter than @xmath115 mag .",
    "nevertheless this does not necessarily mean that there is no galaxy in such halos .",
    "franx et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found a population of red galaxies at @xmath13 which do not have active star formation and so may not be easily detectable by the lyman break technique because of the very faint uv continuum emission .",
    "they estimate that the number density of such red galaxies is about half that of lbgs at the same redshift",
    ". thus it may be the case that a fraction of the dark halos at @xmath116 host such red galaxies rather than bright lbgs that we have discussed here .",
    "\\(iv ) the lbg samples at @xmath13 , 4 and 5 discussed here have very similar limiting absolute magnitudes , @xmath117 . on the other hand",
    ", the minimum mass of their hosting halos seems decreasing with time , although its statistical significance is not strong .",
    "if true , this means that the star formation efficiency per unit dark matter mass , @xmath118 , increases with time .",
    "this increase may suggest that cold gas gradually accumulates in lbgs , if the star formation rate is simply proportional to the amount of cold gas .",
    "\\(v ) there is a weak indication for @xmath23 to increase slightly with time in the lbg samples .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it may be explained by the mutual merging of lbgs .",
    "\\(vi ) for laez5s , our simple hof prescription fails to reproduce simultaneously the observed angular correlation function and number density .",
    "no parameter set gives a reasonably small @xmath85 .",
    "this is mainly because the laez5s exhibit very strong clustering signal on scales larger than 120 arcsec .",
    "in fact , the nature of laez5s is still uncertain in the current result ; models which match both the high correlation amplitude on large scales and the number density of laez5s predict much higher correlation amplitude on small scales than observed .",
    "a possible interpretation of this discrepancy is that the distribution of laes within halos differs from that of dark matter .",
    "if this is the case , the simple halo model description for the lae we adopted in this paper needs to be improved .",
    "also the observational indication for the discrepancy should be carefully confirmed with future larger and more accurate data samples .",
    "alternatively , if one constructs models which match both the correlation function on small scales and the number density of laez5s , they imply a lower correlation amplitude on large scales than observed",
    ". this may be simply due to statistical fluctuation in a sense that the current data do not represent a fair sample of the universe at @xmath6 as indicated by by shimasaku et al .",
    "the hof parameters derived from the fit to the observed data except for the large scale correlation function are @xmath119 and @xmath120 for a reasonable range of @xmath9 .",

    "each figure demonstrates the effect of varying one hof parameter with fixing other two parameters . in all plots ,",
    "the selection function of lbgz4 is adopted for an illustrative purpose .",
    "it should be noticed that a degree of change in the shape of the correlation function made by varying one parameter depends on a choice of other two parameters , thus the plots should be understood as illustrative examples , and we just focus on major characteristics from a qualitative point of view .",
    "figure [ fig : varying - m1 ] shows the effect of varying @xmath23 on @xmath123 . since the 2-halo term does not depend on @xmath23 , the correlation function on larger scales is not affected by the change of @xmath23 .",
    "the amplitude of the 1-halo term decreases with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "this is mainly due to the decrease in the contribution from smaller mass halos .",
    "figure [ fig : varying - mmin ] is for effect of varying @xmath93 .",
    "the amplitude of the 2-halo term increases with @xmath93 , because of a larger bias factor for more massive halos .",
    "the amplitude of the 1-halo term also increases with @xmath93 .",
    "this is largely the decrease in the contribution from smaller mass halos .",
    "finally figure [ fig : varying - m1 ] shows the effect of varying @xmath9 on @xmath123 .",
    "varying @xmath9 changes the fraction of galaxies in massive halo to less massive halos .",
    "a larger @xmath9 gives more weight for galaxies in massive halos . since a stronger bias factor for more massive halo , a larger @xmath9 gives a larger amplitude of the 2-halo term .",
    "the change in the slope of the 1-halo term with varying @xmath9 is explained as follows : since , roughly speaking , galaxies in larger halos contribute to the 1-halo term on relatively larger scales , while galaxies in smaller halos can only contribute to the 1-halo term on smaller scales .",
    "varying @xmath9 changes the fraction in the contribution from larger halos to smaller mass halos , and accordingly changes the slope of the 1-halo term . a smaller @xmath9 results a steeper slope , because of a more weight for galaxies in smaller halos ."

    "<S> we explore empirical relations between three different populations of high - redshift galaxies and their hosting dark halos employing the halo model approach . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we consider lbgs ( lyman - break galaxies ) at @xmath0 and at @xmath1 , and laes ( lyman - alpha emitters ) at @xmath2 , all from the subaru deep field survey extending over an area of about 600 arcmin@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a halo occupation function ( hof ) prescription to parameterize the properties of their hosting halos and the efficiency of halo - dependent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two lbg samples are well described by the halo model with an appropriate hof . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the model predictions with the observed number densities and the angular correlation functions for those galaxies , we obtain constraints on properties of their hosting halos . </S>",
    "<S> a typical mass of hosting halos for lbgs is @xmath4 and the expected number of lbgs per halo is @xmath5 , therefore there is an approximate one - to - one correspondence between halos and lbgs . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a sign of the minimum mass of lbg hosting halos decreasing with time , although its statistical significance is not strong . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implications of these findings on the star formation history of lbgs . on the other hand , for laes </S>",
    "<S> , our simple hof prescription fails to reproduce simultaneously the observed angular correlation function and the number density . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> a very high amplitude of the correlation function on scales larger than 120 arcsec can not be easily reconciled by the hof model ; a set of parameters which account for this high correlation amplitude on large scales predict either excessive clustering on small scales or a much smaller number density than observed . </S>",
    "<S> while this difficulty might imply either that the distribution of laes within hosting halos differs from that of dark matter , or that the strong large - scale correlation is due to the existence of an unusual , large overdense region , and so the survey region is not a representative of the @xmath6 universe , the definite answer should wait for a much wider survey of laes at high redshifts .    </S>",
