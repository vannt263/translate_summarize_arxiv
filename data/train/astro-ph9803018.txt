    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies near 1 kilohertz were discovered from x - ray binaries with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) almost immediately after its launch ( for reviews and references see van der klis 1997 , kaaret & ford 1997a , ford 1997 ) .",
    "these qpos are likely produced very near the accreting neutron star where the dynamical time scale is near @xmath1 seconds .",
    "observations of such fast oscillations provides a new opportunity to measure fundamental properties of neutron stars and the effects of strong field gravity in low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "kilohertz qpos have been discovered in both major subclasses of lmxbs : the z - sources and the atoll sources ( see hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "certain trends are already apparent .",
    "for example , the kilohertz qpos in z - sources are much weaker than those in the lower luminosity atoll sources . in the sources with luminosities intermediate between the majority of z and atoll sources , the persistently bright galactic bulge sources , qpos are apparently absent or very weak ( wijnands , van der klis , & van paradijs 1997a ) . to understand the physical mechanisms at work , further observations of a large sample of sources are needed with the unique capabilities of rxte , likely to be unequaled in the next decade .",
    "here we report the discovery of fast qpos from the low mass x - ray binary 4u  1705 - 44 using rxte .",
    "4u  1705 - 44 has been classified as an atoll source ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "its different source states are supposed to reflect changes in mass accretion rate .",
    "we observe a link between the source state and the presence and frequencies of fast qpos .    in section  2",
    "we summarize the observations and analysis techniques .",
    "section  3 presents the detections of fast qpos and x - ray burst properties . in section  4",
    "we identify the atoll source states during our observations .",
    "section  5 is a discussion of the relation of the source states to the qpo properties and physical implications .",
    "we have observed 4u  1705 - 44 with rxte at random times from february to june 1997 . the total usable observing time amounts to 55.3 ksec , broken into 18 separate continuous intervals .",
    "here we use data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) , ( zhang et al . 1993 ) , which has high time resolution good sensitivity above background from about 2 to 30 kev . in these observations",
    "all five detector units of the pca are on .",
    "the all - sky monitor on rxte shows that during our observations the flux of 4u  1705 - 44 is smoothly varying and has a minimum at about 1 april 1997 . in our observations",
    "the count rate in the pca varies from 500 to 2800 c / s , with a flux of @xmath2 erg  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ( 210 kev ) .    in all observations",
    "we have initiated an ` event ' mode which provides data in time intervals of 122 @xmath5sec in 64 energy channels ranging from about 1 to 100 kev . from this data ,",
    "we extract average fourier power density spectra in 64 second data intervals .",
    "the minimum and maximum observable frequencies are thus 0.016 and 4096 hz .",
    "since qpo strengths depend on energy , it is important to consider energy subbands in searching for qpos .",
    "we employ three energy bands : 2.46.4 kev , 6.431 kev , and the full energy range of the pca .",
    "we fit each qpo feature in the power spectra with a lorentzian plus a constant .",
    "the fit values determine the centroid frequencies , widths and rms fractions of the qpos .",
    "we use @xmath6 for quoting errors and @xmath7 for upper limits ( 95% confidence ) .",
    "only those qpo features with significance greater than @xmath8 are reported here .",
    "figure  [ fig : pds ] shows an example power spectrum from 3072 seconds of data beginning 1997 april 3 18:23:56 utc .",
    "the narrow qpo at @xmath9 hz is detected with a significance of @xmath10 for a single fitting .",
    "six of our 18 observing intervals exhibit qpos in the range 780 to 870 hz ( table  1 ) .",
    "most qpos are detected in both the 6.431 kev band and the full energy band , but not in the 2.46.4 kev band .",
    "the rms fraction of the qpos increase with energy ( figure  [ fig : rmse ] ) , similar to other sources .",
    "in addition to the qpo clearly detected at 780 to 870 hz , we have evidence for a second qpo at higher frequency .",
    "this qpo is visible in one observing interval ( 1997 april 3 16:38:04 ) at @xmath11 hz in the 2.46.4 kev band with an rms fraction @xmath12% .",
    "the significance is @xmath13 , though this is for a single trial .",
    "the quoted error in frequency includes systematic errors due to rebinning the power spectra in frequency , an important effect for weak features .",
    "the two qpos in this interval are separated by @xmath0  hz .    to help confirm the presence of the second qpo we have implemented the ` shift  and  add ' technique of mendez et al .",
    "( 1998 ) with which one can improve sensitivity by adding multiple power spectra .",
    "we take all the power spectra where the lower frequency qpo is detectable , rescale the frequencies so the lower frequency qpos all have the same centroid , and then add the power spectra together . with this technique , we also detect the second qpo .",
    "the significances and rms fractions are : @xmath14 , @xmath12% ( full energy band ) ; @xmath15 , @xmath16% ( 2.46.4 kev ) ; and @xmath17 , @xmath18% ( 6.431 kev ) .",
    "the upper limits for a typical single observing interval are 3.1% ( full band ) and 3.9% ( 6.431 kev ) .",
    "thus , our non - detection in single intervals is consistent with the rms fractions determined when the data are combined using the shift technique . in all energy bands",
    "the frequency separation of the two qpos is consistent with with the previously quoted value of @xmath0 hz to within @xmath19 .",
    "there are five x - ray bursts during our observations .",
    "we have searched for qpos in all of the bursts , generating power spectra in one  second intervals in each of the three energy bands identified above .",
    "we detect no qpos in any of the time intervals or energy subbands .",
    "the upper limits to the rms fraction at the peaks of the bursts are approximately 5% in the three weak bursts and 2% in the stronger bursts .",
    "these upper limits are much smaller than the amplitudes of the qpos in the bursts from 4u  1728 - 34 where the amplitudes reach 20% and perhaps even 40% ( strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) .    of the five bursts from 4u  1705 - 44 ,",
    "two occur when the source is in the banana state ( 16 february and 4 april ) .",
    "these bursts have total durations of about 10 sec , rise times of 0.6 sec , and average temperatures of about 1.1  kev .",
    "three additional bursts occur when the source is in the island state ( 1 april ) .",
    "these are about 3 times longer , have peak count rates about 4 times smaller , rise times of 4.55.0 sec , and average temperatures of about 1.3  kev .",
    "the bursts in 4u  1705 - 44 are cooler compared to those in 4u  1728 - 34 ( roughly 1.2 vs. 2.2 kev ) and have smaller fluences and rise times .",
    "the absence of qpos in 4u  1705 - 44 bursts is perhaps due to the lower temperatures , and larger inferred sizes ( 612 km radii for a distance of 11 kpc ) . if the oscillation is due to burning in a hot spot ( strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) a larger emitting area results in a reduced oscillation strength .",
    "oscillations may also be absent if the hot spot is near the rotation axis or that our line of sight is closely aligned with the spin axis of the neutron star .",
    "for each observation , we have identified the source state following hasinger & van der klis ( 1989 ) , based on the power at low frequencies ( approximately 0.01 to 100 hz ) and the x - ray colors of the source . at low count rates ( 29 march and 1 april ) ,",
    "the source is in an ` island ' state of the atoll source ; below about 10 hz there is strong band  limited noise , with a fractional rms greater than 20% ( fig  [ fig : lowf]_a _ ) . as the count rate increases",
    ", the source moves into a ` banana ' state , the band  limited noise gets much weaker , and a separate noise component appears in the power spectra below 1 hz described by a power law ( fig  [ fig : lowf]_b _ ) . the observations on 16 february , 3 april and 4 april are in the banana state . on 9 june",
    "the source is in the upper banana .",
    "there are three days of observations in the lower banana state : 16 february , 3 april and 4 april . within the lower banana",
    ", the hard color of the source gets softer while the high - frequency noise component decreases .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the motion along the banana branch as observed in 4u  1705 - 44 with exosat ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) , though in this lowest part of the banana branch the movements in the color diagrams are very small and the changes in the amplitude of the noise components are significant only at the @xmath20 level . in order of increasing progress along the banana branch ,",
    "the observations are ordered as : 3 april , last half of 4 april , first half of 4 april , and 16 february . in table  1",
    "we assign a numerical ranking of the states from 1 to 7 going from the island state to the upper banana state .",
    "the inferred mass accretion increases from 1 to 7 .",
    "the 760870 hz qpo in 4u  1705 - 44 is probably a single feature and is likely the lower frequency of two qpo peaks .",
    "the second qpo , which we identify at 1074 hz , then is the higher frequency peak .",
    "more observations in the lower banana state are needed to confirm the presence of this second qpo .",
    "such phenomenology is very similar to other atoll sources .",
    "a single strong qpo near 800 hz is present at times in several sources , e.g. 4u  1608 - 52 ( berger et al . 1996 ; mendez et al .",
    "1998 ) , 4u  1820 - 30 ( smale , zhang & white 1997 ) , 4u  1636 - 53 ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ; wijnands et al .",
    "1997b ) . in all of these sources",
    "a second qpo is sometimes detectable ( see above references ) .",
    "the frequency separation of the two peaks is similar to that in 4u  1705 - 44 .",
    "such double qpos , and also the qpos observed in x - ray bursts ( e.g. strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) , suggest a beat frequency mechanism ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "if such an interpretations holds , then the frequency separation of the qpos in 4u  1705 - 44 implies that the spin period of the neutron star in this system is @xmath21 msec .",
    "the appearance and frequency of the fast qpos in 4u  1705 - 44 are correlated with the states of the source .",
    "the states in turn are thought to be related to the mass accretion rate , with the accretion rate increasing from the island to the banana . at the lower end of the banana branch",
    "a qpo appears at about 780 hz . further along the branch",
    "the frequency increases to 835 hz and then 865 hz .",
    "this behavior supports models where the qpo modulation is generated at an inner disk edge which shrinks as the mass accretion rate increases ( e.g. miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "we detect the second qpo at 1073 hz only in the the lowest part of the banana where the frequency of the stronger qpo is at its lowest .",
    "farthest along the banana branch the qpo becomes undetectable with rms fraction upper limits of about 2% . at the highest accretion rates , the reduced qpo amplitude is perhaps due to spreading of the accretion stream",
    ", alternatively a puffed  up inner disk may obscure the central source ( smale , zhang & white 1997 ) .",
    "similar behavior is observed in other x - ray binaries .",
    "atoll source state identifications have been made simultaneous with fast qpo detection in 4u  1636 - 53 ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ; wijnands et al .",
    "1997b ) , 4u  1735 - 44 ( wijnands et al .",
    "1997c ) , 4u  1820 - 30 ( smale , zhang & white 1997 ) and ks  1731 - 260 ( wijnands & van der klis 1997d ) . these sources were observed in the banana branch .",
    "consistent with the present data , the qpo in all cases is detected only in the lower part of the banana and disappears as the source moves up along the banana branch . in 4u  0614 + 091",
    "a similar effect appears as the qpo amplitude decreases as the count rate increases ( ford 1997 ) .",
    "the situation is less clear at low mass accretion rates , i.e. in the island states .",
    "our upper limits of about 4% rms fraction are not very constraining .",
    "qpos have been detected in island states in both 4u  0614 + 091 ( mendez et al .",
    "1997 ) and 4u  1608 - 52 ( yu et al .",
    "1997 ) . at the lowest count rates in the island state of 4u  0614 + 091",
    "the qpo is not detected ( mendez et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this fits the general trend we observe here .",
    "the qpo frequency shows no correlation with count rate or energy flux in the 210 kev band , though we note that the range of count rates is small ( 1205 to 1236 c / s ) .",
    "an effect similar to that seen in 4u  0614 + 091 may be at work , where there is no unique correlation between rate and frequency in different observations separated by several months ( ford et al .",
    "the present data indicate that the qpo frequency is better correlated with the atoll state of the source .",
    "changes in the source state are reflected as changes in the x - ray colors , which in turn are simply changes in the energy spectrum of the source .",
    "therefore the state ",
    "frequency correlation also manifests as a spectrum ",
    "frequency correlation . from other sources",
    "we know that the changes in qpo frequency are linked to changes in the energy spectrum .",
    "the frequencies of the qpos in 4u  0614 + 091 are well correlated with the flux of a blackbody component in the energy spectrum ( ford et al . 1997b ) , and in that source and also 4u  1608 - 52 the qpo frequencies are correlated with the spectral index of the power law component in the energy spectrum ( kaaret et al . 1998 ) .",
