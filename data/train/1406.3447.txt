    "then the simplest theoretical approach to exciton dynamics builds on two - level models borrowed from quantum optics in which the many - body structure and the geometry are usually disregarded .",
    "nonetheless , the coulomb interaction , the confinement potential and carrier relaxation unavoidably play a major role in self - assembled qds .",
    "the existing literature provides extensive and realistic calculations of exciton and biexciton states and absorption spectra for various qd shapes ( see e.g ref . ) but systematic _ time - dependent _ calculations derived from the fock space structure of the exciton complexes are still required .",
    "recent studies emphasized the effect of coulomb correlations on carrier scattering and therefore the need to go beyond the single - particle framework of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the efficiency of any quantum protocol for optical manipulation of qd many - body states is strongly affected by intraband relaxation ( ibr ) .",
    "therefore predictive theoretical simulations must be performed by taking such processes into account . as expected ,",
    "the intraband relaxation can be safely neglected if one restricts the optical driving to @xmath4-shell excitons and biexcitons which are rather robust against decoherence .",
    "in contrast , the intraband relaxation is crucial for an appropriate description of the @xmath5-shell dynamics .",
    "actually various effects due to the simultaneous optical driving of @xmath4 and @xmath5 shells were already reported in recent experiments which partly motivated the present work .",

    "the single - particle spectra for electrons and holes are obtained by diagonalizing the corresponding hamiltonians , as discussed in section ii .",
    "it turns out that the low - energy hole spectrum is accurately computed if the single - particle basis @xmath18 is truncated to @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",

    "the finite splitting @xmath108 within the @xmath5-shell is due to light - hole heavy - hole mixing induced by the spin - orbit coupling . in this case",

    "we describe the non - interacting mbs built from single - particle states by the quantum numbers of the electrons occupying the conduction band and by the quantum numbers of the holes . recalling that @xmath121 and @xmath122 one can set notations for the hole @xmath4-shell states @xmath123 , @xmath124 and for the @xmath5-shell states @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",

    "in other words the dominant character of the state @xmath134 is @xmath5-like .",
    "similarly , the purity of the interacting @xmath4-shell exciton is typically around @xmath139 .",
    "note that by convention the spin index of the exciton state and of the weight coefficients refer to the electron spin orientation .",
    "we shall see in the next subsection that the coulomb mixing also operates on biexciton states .    in the absence of electron - hole interaction ( i.e for @xmath140 )",
    "we find that the gap between the states @xmath141 and @xmath142 is very close to the gap @xmath108 within the @xmath5 shell , which was found to be less than 1mev for a wide range of radii ( see fig.1(b ) ) .",

    "the @xmath4-shell biexciton is simply @xmath163 .",
    "let us comment on the effect of electron - hole ( e - h ) exchange interaction which is neglected in the present work .",
    "pseudopotential calculations @xcite revealed that even for cylindrical systems the reduced symmetry of the atomistic confining potential leads to non - vanishing e - h exchange which in turn induces exciton fine structure .",
    "the short - range exchange is proportional to the probability for the electron and the hole to be at the same site @xcite and does not split the bright states .",
    "the non - local ( anisotropic ) part of the e - h exchange then splits the bright states and mixes excitons with completely opposite projections of total angular momentum ( see e.g ref . ) .",
    "this splitting is however much smaller than the matrix element @xmath136 which mixes the bright excitons from different @xmath5-subshells ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . therefore we do not expect the weights in eq.([xp ] ) to be significantly altered in the presence of the e - h exchange .",
    "moreover , the circularly polarized pulses used in our simulations activate excitons with well defined spins of the electron - hole pair .",
    "similarly , the electron - electron and hole - hole exchange interaction have even larger values ( around 18 mevs for the dots considered in our simulations ) so that the @xmath0-biexciton structure given in eqs.([bsp_0 ] ) and ( [ bsp_1 ] ) is also stable against e - h exchange .",
    "we shall now study the dynamics of @xmath0 biexciton with antiparallel spins @xmath152 .",
    "one can prepare this biexciton state by applying two laser pulses according to the following scheme : i ) a @xmath2 pulse of frequency @xmath164 drives a @xmath165 rotation of the @xmath4-type exciton @xmath151 ; ii ) the pulse is switched off once the _ initialization _ of @xmath151 is complete ( at instant @xmath166 ) and a 2nd @xmath3 _ control _ pulse of frequency @xmath167 is simultaneously turned on ; iii ) the latter optically activates the @xmath5-shell hole states leading thus to the appearance of the @xmath0 biexciton .",
    "note that the biexcitons with parallel spins ( @xmath168 ) can only be prepared if the initialization and control pulses have the same polarization , while the preparation of antiparallel configuration ( @xmath169 ) requires opposite polarizations .",
    "this means in particular that the degenerated biexciton states @xmath152 and @xmath170 can be individualy selected by appropriate polarization of the pulses . the intraband relaxation is expected to strongly damage antiparallel spin configurations ( see eqs.([t - anti]),([s - anti ] ) ) while the parallel triplets @xmath171 are more robust due to the spin blockade effect @xcite .",
    "the biexciton absorption spectrum corresponding to the initial state @xmath151 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the 2nd @xmath3 pulse scans the @xmath4 shell biexciton @xmath172 and various @xmath0 biexcitons . besides @xmath152",

    "fig.4(a ) confirms that in the absence of intraband relaxation the exciton and biexciton populations exhibit rabi oscillations , the qd state being periodically switched between @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we also note that the occupation sum @xmath185 at all times so that the dynamics of the system is entirely described by these two states only .",
    "the two - color protocol described above resembles the conditional c - not gate proposed in ref .",
    ", the difference being that here we deal with @xmath0 biexcitons instead of @xmath4-shell biexcitons .",
    "more precisely , the control state is the @xmath4-shell exciton while the target state is the @xmath0 biexciton generated by the 2nd control pulse .",
    "the conditional feature comes from the fact that the biexciton population changes noticeably if and only if the @xmath4-shell exciton is occupied .",
    "this imposes thus a resonant condition for the 2nd pulse @xmath186 .",
    "note that the target biexciton state can not be written as a product of two excitonic qubits ( see eq.([bsp_0 ] ) ) ; this would be the case if one restricts the dynamics to @xmath4-shell excitons . as a consequence",
    "the relevant computational space @xcite for the c - not operations is more complicated .",
    "for all simulations presented below we have checked that the formation of more complicated mbs ( i.e three e - h pairs ) due to simultaneous transition of two electrons from the vb @xmath5-shell to cb can be safely neglected .",
    "the dynamics of paralel triplet states @xmath170 is rather similar to the one displayed in fig.4(a ) , because the spin coulomb blockade prevents fast relaxation processes ( not shown ) .",
    "the effect of intraband relaxation processes is shown in fig.4(b ) .",
    "the rabi oscillations are strongly damped and the 2nd maximum of the biexciton population does not exceed @xmath187 , therefore the fidelity of the exciton - biexciton c - not gate is rapidly compromised .",
    "one also notices the uniform filling of the @xmath4-type biexciton @xmath172 due to the electron intraband relaxation . in the long time",
    "limit @xmath188 saturates at @xmath189 ( not shown ) .",
    "we now discuss in more detail the relaxation processes .",
    "already by looking at fig.4(b ) one can guess that in this case the dynamics does not involve only the states @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath172 ; if this was the case one would check that the occupations of these states sum up to 1 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the qd relaxation to the biexciton state @xmath172 activates some transient states ( ts ) .",
    "one can see for example that the @xmath190 spin - conserving relaxation drives the system to a final @xmath4-shell biexciton through the following paths : @xmath191 here the double ( simple ) arrow marks relaxation processes of holes ( electrons ) .",
    "since the hole relaxation is the fastest process the paths given in eq.([fast ] ) are more favorable and dominate the dynamics on short time scale ( this fact wil be confirmed by numerical results presented sligthly below ) .",
    "clearly the antiparallel triplet configurations @xmath192 become populated via hole triplet relaxation whereas @xmath193 are filled via slower electron triplet relaxation .",
    "note also that the hole relaxation within the @xmath5 shell ( i.e. @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) leads to the occupation of the states @xmath196 which will further relax to @xmath197 .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath198 as the sum of the occupations of the four transient states introduced above ( see the middle states in eqs.([fast ] ) and ( [ slow ] ) ) : @xmath199 the transient states @xmath192 are non - trivial due to the exchange - coupled electrons belonging to different shells .",
    "moreover , these states can be probed with pulses centered on the @xmath4-shell transition , which allows us to get information on their lifetime and occupation .",
    "we find that under a 3rd @xmath3 pulse the states @xmath192 couple to @xmath5-like skewed excitons @xmath200 ( the electronic @xmath5 character of these states comes from the dominant weight of @xmath201 ) .",
    "based on the above observations we simulate in fig.5 a three - pulse experiment for the optical probing of the transient states .",
    "the setup goes as follows : i ) the antiparallel @xmath0 biexciton is generated as before but now the 2nd pulse is turned off once the population @xmath179 reached its maximum ( i.e. at @xmath202ps ) .",
    "ii ) the system relaxes through ts without any optical driving .",
    "iii ) at @xmath203ps we tune a 3rd @xmath3 pulse to the transitions between ts and skewed excitons @xmath204 .",
    "the pulse frequency is set as @xmath205 .",
    "the dynamics of the system along this procedure is not difficult to read from fig.5 .",
    "first , the @xmath0 biexciton displays a clear exponential decay . from fig.5(a ) one notices that at @xmath203ps @xmath198 is around @xmath206 while the occupation of @xmath172 is only around @xmath207 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the ts are filled much faster than the @xmath4-shell biexciton , the latter being populated via slower electron relaxation .",
    "the optical response of the transient states is recorded as damped rabi oscillations for @xmath208ps .",
    "we also plot the total occupation of skewed states .",
    "the rabi oscillations damping comes obviously from the relaxation of the @xmath5-shell electrons .",
    "one should realize that in order to get a strong optical response of the transient states a certain delay @xmath209 between the 2nd and the 3rd pulses is needed in order to achieve a significant filling",
    ". typically one should consider @xmath210 ( in fig.5(a ) @xmath211ps ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath209 is sufficiently large the observed rabi oscillations will rather originate from the transition between the biexciton @xmath172 and the @xmath4-shell excitons .",
    "the resonant frequency @xmath212 .",
    "we illustrate this fact in fig.5(b ) where the 3rd pulse is applied at @xmath213ps ( @xmath214ps ) ) . at that instant",
    "the occupation of the ts considerably diminished and the @xmath4-type biexciton is the dominant configuration .",
    "the periodic oscillations can not be associated to ts as their occupation continues to decrease slowly and do not respond to the pulse .    on the other hand",
    "clear oscillations of the @xmath4-shell exciton develop .",
    "let us stress here that the frequencies @xmath215 and @xmath216 are actually very close ( see the values given in the caption of fig.5 for the present simulation ) .",
    "however , one can still identify the origin of the rabi oscillations from their aspect , i.e. damped ( when associated to transient states ) or not ( when given by pure @xmath4-shell configurations ) .     of transient states containing antiparallel @xmath0 electronic triplets for different hole relaxation times @xmath96 .",
    "( b ) the same quantity for different electron relaxation times @xmath97 . the slow total filling @xmath217 as function of @xmath96 ( c ) and @xmath97 ( d ) .",
    "note that in figs.(c ) and ( d ) the occupations are multiplied by 10 .",
    "@xmath218 and @xmath217 are defined in the text .",
    "other parameteres : @xmath153 nm , @xmath109 nm , @xmath219ps , @xmath154kv / cm . , scaledwidth=52.5% ]    the dynamics of the transient states was further investigated by performing numerical simulations for different relaxation times @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "we plot in figs.6(a ) and ( b ) the total occupation of the antiparallel triplet transient states @xmath220 which are filled through fast hole relaxation processes . for completeness",
    "we also present in figs.6(c ) and ( d ) the occupation @xmath221 of the slowly filled states .",
    "the setup is the same as in fig.5 , namely the 2nd pulse is turned off at @xmath222ps .",
    "the occupation @xmath218 exceeds by far the filling of the states @xmath193 which requires spin relaxation . the maximum of @xmath218 increases when @xmath96 decreases or if @xmath97 increases ( slower electron relaxation ) .",
    "the three curves shown in fig.6(a ) overlap for @xmath223ps as the spin relaxation time is the same .",
    "in contrast , the short time dynamics does not change with @xmath97 ( see fig.6(b ) ) , confirming that electron relaxation processes are not important in this regime .",
    "the slow states behave quite differently , namely their maximum increases if @xmath96 increases or when @xmath97 decreases .",
    "note that @xmath217 depends on @xmath96 at short times because of the triplet hole states @xmath224 .",
    "it is also clear that the fast transient states dominate the dynamics , the contribution of the slow ones being negligible and vanishing at longer times .",
    "the above results confirm that in the presence of hole relaxation one can not neither prepare a long - lived @xmath0 biexciton state nor achieve a high - efficiency c - not gate .",
    "we will show instead that the antiparallel @xmath0 triplet configuration of the transient states is more stable against intraband relaxation and can be therefore used as two - qubit electron state in further manipulation schemes .",
    "note that @xmath217 depends on @xmath96 at short times because of the triplet hole states @xmath224 .",
    "it is also clear that the fast transient states dominate the dynamics , the contribution of the slow ones being negligible and vanishing at longer times .     of antiparallel electronic @xmath0 triplet at different relaxation times @xmath97 .",
    "the occupation of the biexciton state @xmath172 increases faster when the electron relaxation time decreases .",
    "other parameters : @xmath153 nm , @xmath109 nm , @xmath219ps , @xmath154kv / cm . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the above results confirm that in the presence of hole relaxation one can not neither prepare a long - lived @xmath0 biexciton state nor achieve a high - efficiency c - not gate .",
    "we will show instead that the antiparallel @xmath0 triplet configuration of the transient states is more stable against intraband relaxation and can be therefore used as two - qubit electron state in further manipulation schemes .",
    "the main point is that the @xmath0 biexciton and the transient states differ only by the configuration of holes , whereas the electrons occupy one of the triplet states @xmath225 . as a consequence ,",
    "the time - dependent occupation of antiparallel triplet configuration is given by @xmath226 .",
    "we plot this quantity in fig.7 for different electron relaxation times .",
    "one observes that the occupation of the antiparallel triplet configurations in the conduction band is not significantly affected as long as the filling of the @xmath4-shell biexciton via electron relaxation processes is sufficiently small ( say less than @xmath227 ) . the latter is also shown in fig.7 for the same parameters . looking at fig.7",
    "we see that the probability of antiparallel configuration of the conduction band exceeds @xmath189 for few picoseconds at @xmath228ps , while for @xmath229ps @xmath230 is still large ( i.e @xmath231 ) even at @xmath203ps or @xmath232ps ( @xmath233 )",
    ".    otherwise stated , the proposed two - pulse sequence can be used to prepare antiparallel @xmath0 triplet configurations for electrons , without taking care of the hole configuration .",
    "let us mention here that the triplet state measured in ref .",
    "( ) appears only if the initial qd state is an excited one : there are two extra electrons in the conduction band and no holes ( full valence band ) . in our setup",
    "the initial state is the ground state ( empty conduction band and full valence band ) which allows a better control over the fast initialization of the triplet state .",
    "we stress that in the present two - color protocol the antiparallel triplet states appear due to electron - electron exchange interaction .",
    "according to the single - particle optical selection rules the 2nd @xmath3 pulse would only generate the electron - hole pair @xmath234 .",
    "this is actually the case if the @xmath3 pulse acts on the ground state .",
    "however , in our scenario the 2nd pulse finds the system in the exciton state @xmath235 and the exchange interaction instantaneously leads to the formation of antiparallel triplet state .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations for qds of different sizes and obtained similar results .",
    "finally we emphasize that the role of electron - electron exchange interaction in cdte qds can not be neglected , its value ( see e.g ref . ) being much larger than for inas / gaas qds ( few mev ) . in the latter case",
    "one can argue @xcite that if the pulse width exceeds the singlet - triplet splitting the exchange interaction effects are washed out .",
    "the setup studied here involves rather sharp pulses , the goal of the two - pulse protocol being to prepare a given non - trivial many - body state rather than probing the relaxation processes .",
    "we investigated fast conditional operations on @xmath0 biexcitons in cdte disk - shaped qds in the presence of intraband carrier relaxation .",
    "the single - particle spectral properties are obtained from the four - band @xmath1 theory , whereas the coulomb interaction is taken into account within the configuration - interaction method .",
    "the von neumann - lindblad equation is used to derive the time - dependent occupation of relevant exciton and biexciton states .",
    "the disk - shaped qds have a rich spectral single - particle structure which leaves its fingerprints on the exciton and biexciton states .",
    "in particular we find that the small gap within the @xmath5 shell leads to strong configuration mixing for both exciton and biexciton states .",
    "we focused on two - pulse manipulation schemes activating first an @xmath4-shell exciton and subsequently an @xmath0 biexciton .",
    "as expected , the exciton - biexciton rabi oscillations are strongly damped if the target biexciton state is made of triplet states with antiparallel spins . at short times",
    "the main source of decoherence comes from fast hole relaxation processes .",
    "more precisely , the relaxation from the @xmath0 state is mediated by transient states which then slowly deplete via electron relaxation in favor of the final @xmath4-shell biexciton state .",
    "the transient states are optically active and also lead to damped optical rabi oscillations under a 3rd probe pulse .",
    "our simulations show that the electronic antiparallel triplet configurations present in the transient states preserve a rather high purity for at least 5ps after the pump pulse is switched off .",
    "this suggests that appropriate two - color manipulation protocols can be used to initialize antiparallel @xmath0 triplet states in the conduction band .",
    "such states are no - trivial and may provide information on the dynamics of entangled electrons .",
    "it also turns out that in the presence of intraband relaxation the dynamics of the @xmath0 biexcitons can not be described by an effective @xmath6 evolution operator as it is usually the case in the study of pure @xmath4 type biexcitons @xcite or for two - qubit operations in coulomb - coupled quantum dots @xcite .",
    "this happens because the intraband relaxation activates configurations which are otherwise forbidden , increasing thus the fock subspace relevant for the qd dynamics .",
