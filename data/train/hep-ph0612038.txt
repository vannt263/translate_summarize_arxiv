    "the quark structure of hadrons at low momentum transfers can manifest itself in many physical phenomena .",
    "it is very important for their static properties as , e.g. , magnetic moments and mass relations which are reasonably well described by the constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "it can be used for description of the elastic amplitudes at low momentum transfers and spin effects in two - body processes @xcite . also , as it was suggested long time ago @xcite , and rediscovered recently @xcite",
    ", the quark structure of nucleon may be crucial in analysis of particle production from nuclear targets .    in most applications of the quark model to low - momentum transfer phenomena",
    "only single @xmath2 interactions are considered . in this case",
    "the possible correlations between constituents are unimportant .",
    "when multiple scattering is taken into account @xcite , however , the effects of correlations can not be neglected .",
    "scattering can be inferred from @xcite . ]",
    "one possibility to introduce correlations between the constituent quarks inside the nucleon is to combine two of the quarks into one object , a diquark @xcite .",
    "this is the possibility we explore in the present investigation : we discuss the elastic nucleon - nucleon scattering , assuming that the nucleon is composed of two constituents - a quark and a diquark .",
    "our main goal is to determine the properties of these two constituents by comparing the results of calculations with data .",
    "they are needed for the analysis of rhic data on particle production from nuclei @xcite in the  wounded  @xcite constituent model @xcite .    in its most general formulation ,",
    "the quark - diquark model assumes that the nucleon consists of two constituents ( quark and diquark ) , acting independently .",
    "this assumption must be , surely , supplemented by a more detailed description of the specific properties of constituents and of the distribution of constituents inside the nucleon .",
    "thus the model is rather flexible and one should not be surprised that it can be adjusted to describe correctly the data .",
    "the real interest is that , when confronted with data , the model can provide information on the details of nucleon structure at small momentum transfers .",
    "this is exactly the logic behind the present investigation .",
    "we first verify if the model can account for the data on low momentum transfer elastic proton - proton scattering at high energies .",
    "we found that this is indeed the case and that one obtains a really excellent description of data .",
    "this allows to discuss the main point of this paper : the properties of the two constituents and their distribution inside the nucleon .",
    "two formulations , differing by the treatment of the diquark structure , were considered .",
    "one treats the diquark as a single object , the second one as an object composed of two constituent quarks . both gave rather similar results , indicating that our conclusions are not sensitive to the details of the model .",
    "the most spectacular outcome is that the diquark turns out to be rather large , comparable to the size of the nucleon itself .",
    "other conclusions are discussed in the last section .    in the next section the general formulation of the model and its consequences for high - energy small momentum transfer scattering",
    "are described .",
    "two specific examples of the implementation of these general ideas are presented ( and the corresponding results discussed ) in sections 3 and 4 . in the last section our conclusions",
    "are listed and commented .",
    "we follow the standard point of view that the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude , dominating at high energy , is generated by the absorption of the incident particle wave , represented by the inelastic ( non - diffractive ) collisions .",
    "the inelastic proton - proton cross - section at a fixed impact parameter @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is calculated using the rules of the probability calculus .",
    "one writes@xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the distribution of quark and diquark inside the nucleon , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are transverse positions of the quarks and diquarks in the two colliding nucleons , and @xmath9 is the probability of interaction at fixed impact parameter and the transverse positions of all constituents taking part in the process .",
    "this configuration is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_pp ] .",
    "since the constituents act independently we have @xcite:@xmath10[1-\\sigma_{qd}(b+s_{d}^{\\prime}-s_{q}% ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   [ 1-\\sigma_{dq}(b+s_{q}^{\\prime}-s_{d})][1-\\sigma_{dd}(b+s_{d}^{\\prime } -s_{d})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 are inelastic differential cross - sections of the constituents ( @xmath12 denotes @xmath2 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) .        for the distribution of the constituents inside the nucleon",
    "we take a gaussian with radius @xmath15 : @xmath16 the second parameter , @xmath17 , has the physical meaning of the ratio of the quark and diquark masses @xmath18 ( the delta function guarantees that the center - of - mass of the system moves along the straight line ) .",
    "one expects of course @xmath19 .",
    "our strategy is to adjust the parameters of the model by demanding that ( i ) the total inelastic cross section ( ii ) the slope of the elastic cross section at @xmath20 ( iii ) the position of the first diffractive minimum in elastic cross section and ( iv ) the height of the second maximum in elastic scattering are in agreement with data .",
    "the unitarity condition implies for the elastic amplitude @xmath21 the elastic amplitude in momentum transfer representation @xmath22 is a fourier transform of the amplitude in impact parameter space:@xmath23 where @xmath24 is the bessel function .",
    "with this normalization one can evaluate the relevant measurable quantities .",
    "total cross section:@xmath25 elastic differential cross section ( @xmath26):@xmath27 slope of the elastic cross section ( at @xmath20):@xmath28    in the next sections we discuss two different choices for inelastic differential cross - sections of the constituents @xmath29 .",
    "as a first choice we parametrized @xmath29 using simple gaussian forms:@xmath30 the radii @xmath31 were constrained by the condition @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the quark or diquark s radius ( a natural constraint for the gaussians ) .",
    "this means that the quark and the diquark are treated on the same footing , their internal structures being described by one parameter , the radius ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) .    from ( [ pab ] )",
    "we deduce the total inelastic cross sections : @xmath36 . to reduce the number of parameters",
    ", we also demand that the ratios of cross - sections satisfy the condition:@xmath37 expressing the idea that there are twice as many partons in the constituent diquark than those in the constituent quark ( shadowing neglected ) .",
    "this allows to evaluate @xmath38 and @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40:@xmath41    one sees that the model in this form contains @xmath42 parameters @xmath15 , @xmath17 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath40 ( we expect @xmath40 to be close to @xmath43 ) .",
    "now the calculation of @xmath4 shown in ( [ sigma ] ) reduces to straightforward gaussian integrations .",
    "the relevant formula is given in the appendix .",
    "we have analyzed the data at all isr energies @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the model works very well indeed , thus it is flexible enough .",
    "note that this is not entirely trivial conclusion .",
    "for instance , an analogous calculation performed in the model with the assumption that the proton consists of three uncorrelated constituent quarks led to negative conclusions @xcite .",
    "four examples of our calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_a ] , where the differential cross section @xmath44 at the isr energies @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 gev , evaluated from the model , are compared with data @xcite .",
    "one sees an impressive agreement .",
    "note that we are adjusting the model to account only for the slope and the value at @xmath20 , and for the position of the minimum .",
    "nevertheless , one sees that the resulting curve follows very well the subtle structure of the cross - section between @xmath20 and the minimum .",
    "this indicates that the nucleon model with two very different constituents may indeed represent more than a simple parametrization of data .",
    "the values of the parameters at various energies are given in the table [ tab_a ] . and",
    "@xmath17 are correlated .",
    "those given in the table are obtained by demanding @xmath49 .",
    "] one sees some tendency for all radii to increase with increasing energy .",
    "given the experimental and theoretical inaccuracies the effect is barely significant .",

    "it is almost three times larger than the radius of the quark , and not very much smaller than the radius of the proton itself .",
    "it is interesting that this feature agrees with other estimates @xcite , based on rather different arguments .",
    "in this section we consider another option , treating the diquark as a system composed of the two constituent quarks . as before we parametrize @xmath51 using the same simple gaussian as in ( [ pab ] ) .",
    "@xmath52    to evaluate quark - diquark and diquark - diquark cross - sections we need the distribution of the quarks inside the diquark which we again take as a gaussian : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are transverse positions of the quarks in the diquark .",

    "the diquark is much larger than the quark ( confirming a weak binding ) , and the distance between quark and diquark even smaller than that in previous calculation .    from ( [ pqq ] ) , ( [ pdq ] ) and ( [ pdd ] )",
    "one can evaluate the total inelastic cross - section of the constituents .",
    "it turns out that the ratio of the cross - sections of the constituents satisfies : @xmath61 which is rather close to ( [ 124 ] ) , indicating a small amount of shadowing .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized in three points .",
    "\\(i ) the constituent quark - diquark structure of the nucleon can account very well for the data on elastic @xmath62 scattering at low momentum transfers and c. m. energies above @xmath63 gev .",
    "\\(ii ) the confrontation with data allows to determine the parameters characterizing the two nucleon constituents .",
    "\\(iii ) the radius of the constituent diquark turns out much larger than that of the constituent quark .",
    "it is comparable to the radius of the nucleon .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "\\(a ) it seems remarkable that our calculation reconstructs precisely the fine structure of the elastic scattering cross - section in the region before the first minimum .",
    "this indicates that , indeed , the two components of the proton with rather different radii are needed to explain the details of data .",
    "\\(b ) it is reassuring that our conclusion about the large radius of the diquark agrees with that obtained in @xcite from rather different arguments .",
    "\\(c ) we have verified that the quark - diquark model gives also a good description of the @xmath64 scattering .",
    "the discussion of this problem will be subject of a separate investigation @xcite .",
    "\\(d ) finally , we find it significant that the quark - quark and quark - diquark cross - sections obtained here , when used in the wounded constituent model @xcite , explain very well the rhic data on particle production in the central rapidity region .",
    "given all these arguments , it seems that the quark - diquark model of the nucleon structure at low momentum transfers does indeed capture the main features of this problem and thus deserves a closer attention .",
