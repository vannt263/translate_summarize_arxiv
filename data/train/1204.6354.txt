    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is one of the most ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy ( york et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "the sdss used a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope at apache point observatory , new mexico , equipped with two powerful special - purpose instruments .",
    "the 120-megapixel camera imaged 1.5 square degrees of sky at a time , about eight times the area of the full moon . over eight years of operations ( sdss - i , 2000 - 2005",
    "; sdss - ii , 2005 - 2008 ) , it obtained deep , multi - color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and created 3-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000 galaxies and more than 120,000 quasars .",
    "meanwhile , sdss is continuing with the third sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) , a program of four new surveys using sdss facilities .",
    "sdss - iii began observations in july 2008 and released its first public data as data release 8 to emphasize its continuity with previous sdss releases .",
    "sdss - iii will continue operating and releasing data through 2014 .",
    "sdss - ii carried out three distinct surveys : the sloan legacy survey , segue ( the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ) , the sloan supernova survey .",
    "sdss - iii builds on the legacy of the sdss and sdss - ii to generate high - quality scientific data and to make important new discoveries .",
    "sdss - iii has been designed to maximize understanding of three scientific themes : dark energy and cosmological parameters , the structure , dynamics , and chemical evolution of the milky way , the architecture of planetary systems .",
    "the creation of a good classifier depends on a complete and representive training sample",
    ". therefore careful preparation of training sample is of great importance . in this specific problem",
    ", we just care about separating quasars from stars and thus exclude extended sources ( galaxy ) .",
    "the training sets and test sets used in this method are produced from four data sets quasar catalogue v ( schneider et  al . 2010 ) , sdss dr7 ( abazajian et  at . 2009 ) , sdss dr8(aihara et  al .",
    "2011 ) and sdss - xdqso ( bovy et  al . 2011 ) . in this section",
    ", we simply introduce these four data sets and how to use them to construct the training set for each svm classifier in detail will be discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "based upon the sdss dr7 , quasar catalogue v contains 105,783 ( lowz_no 88201 , medz_no 14063 , highz_no 3519 ) spectroscopically confirmed quasars and represents the conclusion of the sdss - i and sdss - ii quasar survey . in the following ,",
    "lowz_qso , medz_qso and highz_qso are short for low - redshift quasars , medium - redshift quasars and high - redshift quasars , respectively .",
    "according to the paper ( bovy et  al .",
    "2011 ) , the definition of low - redshift , medium - redshift and high - redshift corresponds to @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , separately . for the several training sets in our svm classification system , nine tenths of quasars ( 95,202",
    "quasars including 79,421 lowz_qso , 12,610 medz_qso and 3,171 highz_qso ) of this catalogue are randomly sampled to construct them and the remaining one tenth of quasars ( 10,581 quasars including 8,780 lowz_qso , 1,453 medz_qso and 348 highz_qso ) will be used as test samples of quasars .",
    "the training sample of stars consists of three parts .",
    "the first part is from the spectral confirmed stars of sdss dr8 , the second part comes from the unidentified pointed sources with _ psfmag_i _",
    "@xmath5 in the subarea of stripe-82 , the third part is made up of the pointed sources with deredened @xmath6-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag in the same subarea of stripe-82 removing those predicted by sdss - xdqso as quasars ( the probability of quasars @xmath7 ) .",
    "the detailed information about the three parts is described as follows .",
    "the spectral confirmed stars used in training sets are produced from _ specphotoall _ table in sdss dr8 using the sql interface to catalog archive server ( cas ) mainly following the criteria described in section 3.2.1 of richards et  al .",
    "2002 . some records in the _ specphotoall _ table of sdss dr8 should be removed because the sky survey plan makes some sources to be duplicately observed several times and some spectroscopically identified objects do nt have photometric corresponding sources .",
    "we set the attribute _ class _ @xmath8 which means this record is a stellar object , _ scienceprimary _ @xmath9 which represents the best version of spectrum at this location , _ mode _ @xmath9 which denotes this record with the best photometric data and _ zwarrning _ @xmath10 to ensure the _ subclass _ of star more reliable .",
    "the records with fatal errors are excluded using _ flags _ such as bright , saturated , edge and blended .",
    "we also reject the objects whose magnitude errors are larger than 0.2 in all five optical bands . in addition , a very few records with the same _ objid _ are weeded out . finally , we get a catalog of 480,878 spectral confirmed stars from _ specphotoall _ table of sdss dr8 and randomly sampled out two thirds ( no .",
    "320584 ) of them for training and the rest ( no .",
    "160,294 ) of them for test .",
    "the sample of photometric stars without spectra is constructed from the _ photoobjall _ table in sdss dr8 using _ mode _ @xmath9 , _ type _",
    "@xmath11 , _ specobjid _ @xmath10 and _ psfmag_i _ @xmath12 .",
    "since sdss stripe-82 ( abazajian et  al . 2009 ) has been observed many times , the data from this area are reliable .",
    "the point sources in this area with the _ psfmag_i _",
    "@xmath12 can rarely be quasars , so these photometric sources are regarded as stars .",
    "actually , we select a subarea which covers 150 deg@xmath13 ( -@xmath14 and -@xmath15 ) and this area was also chosen by sdss - xdqso ( bovy et  al . 2011 ) .",
    "consequently , these are 115,010 photometric stars in this subarea of stripe-82 with the _ psfmag_i _ @xmath12 .",
    "sdss - xdqso method is one of methods which serve sdss - iii for targeting quasars .",

    ", it demonstrates a good performance to the faint objects .",
    "sdss - xdqso quasar targeting catalog contains 160,904,060 point - sources with dereddened @xmath6-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 mag in the 14,555 @xmath16 of imaging from sdsd dr8 . for our training sets",
    ", we just select the objects ( no .",
    "301,043 ) in the subarea of stripe-82 except those predicted as quasars by sdss - xdqso ( the probability of quasars @xmath7 ) .",

    "support vector machines ( svm ) , proposed by vapnik ( 1995 ) , is derived from the theory of structural risk minimization which belongs to statistical learning theory .",
    "the core idea of svm is to map input vectors into a high - dimensional feature space and construct the optimal separating hyperplane in this space .",
    "svm aims at minimizing an upper bound of the generalization error through maximizing the margin between the separating hyperplane and the data .",
    "basically , we are looking for the optimal separating hyperplane between the two classes by maximizing the margin between the classes closest points . in figure",
    "[ fig : sv ] points lying on the boundaries are called support vectors and it means that svm just uses the most representative points to construct a classifier not using all of them .        for a given training set belonging to two different classes",
    "is often called positive class and negative class ( or plus class and minus class ) , @xmath17 svm learns linear threshold functions of the type .",
    "@xmath18 each linear threshold function corresponds to a hyperplane in a feature space and the side of the hyperplane on which an example @xmath19 lies determines the classified result by the function @xmath20 .",
    "if the training data can be separated by at least one hyperplane @xmath21 , the optimal hyperplane with maximum margin can be found by minimizing    @xmath22    which subjects to @xmath23\\ge 1-\\xi_i \\qquad i=1,\\ldots , n\\ ] ] @xmath24    the factor @xmath25 is used to trade off training error against model complexity and @xmath26 are slack variables responding to the wrong prediction . in practice , we would like to penalize the errors on positive examples ( quasars ) stronger than errors on negative examples ( stars ) , because we are much more interested in quasars than stars and the quantity of stars is often much larger than that of quasars .",
    "morik et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) modified the eq .",
    "[ eq : soft_svms ] through minimizing @xmath27 which is constrained by @xmath23\\ge 1-\\xi_k \\qquad   k=1,\\ldots , n\\ ] ] we can use the both factors @xmath28 and @xmath29 to control the cost of false positives versus false negatives and get the result that we focus on .",
    "the books ( vapnik 1995 ; vapnik 1998 ) contain excellent description of svm and the article written by burges ( 1998 ) provides a good tutorial on it . in this paper",
    ", we adopt @xmath30 coded by joachims ( 2002 ) which is an implementation of svm in c language with many extensional and additional softwares , moreover this code provides various model parameters including kernel functions for us to tune .          in this chapter",
    ", we discuss how to use several svm models to build a svm classification system for selecting quasar candidates in detail .",
    "the input pattern of svm is a combination of photometric magnitudes and colors , just like the combination ( psfmag_u - psfmag_g , psfmag_g - psfmag_r , psfmag_r - psfmag_i , psfmag_i - psfmag_z , psfmag_r ) mentioned in gao et al .",
    "all magnitudes in this combination have been corrected by the map of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : svm - draft ] , we give the scheme of the svm classification system with four steps and eleven models .",
    "although many data mining algorithms have been successfully applied on this problem , most of them solved it only with one classifier .",
    "actually this is very hard for one model to include all information at the same time and limits the performance of a classifier .",
    "our idea is that we divide this task into several relative simple subtasks and conquer them respectively .",
    "the work of step_0 ( svm_0 ) is about eliminating the stars that are apparently different from quasars .",
    "step_1 ( svm_1 ) is mainly to separate quasars from the confusing stars .",
    "these two steps are the foundation of this system and many other authors combine the both together or just deal with one of them .",
    "the duty of step_2 ( from svm_20 to svm_25 ) is to divide the quasar candidates into three subclasses . finally , step_3",
    "( svm_30 , svm_31 and svm_32 ) can make a further clean of the quasar candidates of each subclass and improve the prediction accuracies of the subclasses much higher .    for constructing the classifier of svm_0 ,",
    "the above mentioned training samples of stars and quasars in section  [ sec : data ] will be used to build a classifier .",
    "the training samples of stars are adopted from two thirds of spectroscopically confirmed stars in sdss dr8 , photometric stars in sdss dr8 with dereddened @xmath6-band magnitude @xmath12 , photometric stars in sdss - xdqso with dereddened @xmath6-band magnitude between 17.75 and 22.45 and the probability - xdqso less than 0.5 .",
    "nine tenths of spectral identified quasars in schneider s catalog v are randomly sampled and taken as the training sample of quasars .",
    "considering the small sample of quasars , we do nt put constraint on quasars in the scope of the subarea of stripe-82 .",
    "generally when the completeness is higher , the efficiency is lower . since our primary goal in this session is to weed out most stars ( i.e. star_0 ) which are apparently different from quasars and easy to be eliminated , the low efficiency can be accepted . in table",
    "[ tab : tr_data ] , we list all training sets used in each classifier . many confusing stars will be mixed into our quasar candidates ( qso_0 ) of svm_0 in this step but we reserve quasars as many as possible .",
    ".the number of training data used in each svm model .",
    "positive and negative separately denote what role played by the corresponding quasars or stars for constructing a classifier .",
    "from svm_20 to svm_25 just use quasars as the positive and negative samples because their functions are to classify quasar candidates into the three subcategories : lowz_qso , medz_qso and highz_qso . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have put forward a classification system by using a hierarchy of several svm classifiers .",
    "the above experimental results demonstrate that single svm classifier can not well solve the problem of separating quasars from stars , however the combination of some svm classifiers gets a rather good performance .",
    "this method can help us to select a quasar candidate set with a relative high efficiency ( 93.21% ) , though some actual quasars ( 2.51% ) are missing in the whole process .",
    "the point we want to get across is that the performance of this system is based on the test sample and not on real data . in order to check the performance of this method applied on the unknown objects ,",
    "the result produced by the method has been compared with that of the xdqso technique .",
    "the comparison shows that most of quasar candidates selected by the svm system are also recovered by xdqso especially in the deredened i - band magnitude @xmath0 20.0 . in table",
    "[ tab : cof ] , actually the prediction of svm for subclasses of quasars also agrees with that of xdqso .",
    "this means that our method is an effective and feasible approach to construct the input catalog of quasars for large spectroscopic sky survey projects ( e.g. lamost , sdss ) .    in the future",
    ", we plan to adopt the similar method to the xdqso technique to exploit whether the magnitude errors influence the performance of the system , add the number of faint objects in the training sample increases to improve the performance of the system for the data set of faint objects ( deredened i - band magnitude @xmath31 20.0 ) . in the process of svm_1 where many actual quasars are missing , we can consider some other methods to make the completeness of quasars much higher . each technique for quasar candidate selection has its strongness and weakness .",
    "it is difficult to say which one is better . in terms of good efficiency ,",
    "the cross - result from different techniques to select quasar candidates is better chosen .",
    "however , given the completeness of quasar candidates , the combination of results from various techniques has better be employed .",
    "we will give a much more powerful method based on svm to select quasar candidates for lamost or other projects in the world .",
