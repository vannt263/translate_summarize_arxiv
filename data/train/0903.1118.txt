    "the standard model ( sm ) has so far proved remarkably successful . with the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "about to start operating , confirmation of its higgs sector or searches for new physics beyond the sm enter a new , interesting stage , when theoretical ideas and models advocated over the past three decades face the test of new experimental data . in this paper",
    "we consider current precision electroweak data and dark matter constraints and analyse their implications for a rather simple extension of the sm .",
    "this consists of the sm and a particular hidden sector that contains matter which interacts under a new confining gauge group , with an extra @xmath6 massive boson that couples to sm and hidden sector matter .",
    "it was partly motivated by novel lhc signatures and search strategies specific to this type of model .",
    "further interest in this class of models has also been triggered by attempts to explain the excesses in the positron spectrum measured by pamela  @xcite and atic  @xcite .",
    "hidden sectors are a common presence in model building beyond the sm , in models with branes in extra dimensions and in string and supersymmetric models , with many implications such as , for example , supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the physics of the hidden sector can in principle be probed by the mediating particles communicating between the hidden and visible sectors .",
    "while gravitational interactions are the usual standard mediators , renormalisable operators involving messenger fields such as new gauge bosons , scalars , neutralinos or messenger fermions may also be present .",
    "for this latter case , a special class of hidden sectors is that advocated in @xcite , also called `` hidden valley '' ( hv ) , where the hidden sector contains some light states in comparison to the energy scale of the mediator .",
    "if these light states are able to decay to sm states , the dynamics of the hv models can then produce some novel phenomenology @xcite , possibly relevant to the lhc . to select search strategies for such new physics , the restrictions that exist on these models from electroweak and dark matter constraints need to be well understood , and",
    "this is the main task of this paper .    in this paper",
    "we present the constraints on a ",
    "hidden valley \" extension of the sm with a new neutral gauge boson ( @xmath0 ) dominantly responsible for mediation between the sm and hv sectors . in section  [ hvm ]",
    "we present the hidden valley model considered , based on the construction of strassler @xcite , and define the parameters that will be constrained by current experimental data . in this model",
    "the hv matter is confined by a strong ( qcd - like ) interaction in the hidden sector .",
    "the physics of the confining theory is discussed and the spectrum and stability of the hv states determined . in section  [ cz ]",
    "we review the constraints on the @xmath0 from electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) and direct searches , leading to a _ lower mass bound _ for the mediator .",
    "the discussion and conclusions of this section are more general and independent of the physics of the hidden sector .",
    "the numerical limits presented allow for the possibility of arbitrarily large kinetic mixing between the hypercharge and @xmath1 gauge bosons .",
    "so far as we are aware , these are new results and apply to the case that the sm matter have @xmath7 @xmath1 charges . in section  [ dmc ] ,",
    "the consequences of a dark matter candidate in the hidden sector are considered , leading to constraints on the hv dark matter candidate .",
    "this will produce an _ upper mass bound _ on the @xmath0 mediator .",
    "we demonstrate that the lower and upper mass bounds can be simultaneously satisfied in a finite region of parameter space that we identify in detail .",
    "the appendix provides some calculations and results used in the text . in appendix  [ appendix0 ] additional details on neutrinos masses",
    "are provided , while in appendix  [ appendixa ] the gauge boson eigenstates are found after the addition of the local @xmath1 symmetry to the sm . in appendix  [ appendixb ]",
    "we list the perturbative gauge boson partial decay rates and spin-0 particle annihilation cross sections used in section  [ dmc ] . in appendix  [ appendixc ] , we discuss non - perturbative corrections to the matrix element for slow moving particles , and present the sommerfeld factor for p - wave multiparticle states in the presence of yukawa interactions used for the dark matter relic density calculations .",
    "here we construct a simple extension of the sm based on the construction in @xcite , which can lead to an interesting non - standard phenomenology .",
    "the choice of hidden valley matter content and symmetries is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "in addition to the non - supersymmetric sm particle content with right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath8 ) , four new weyl fermions ( @xmath9 ) are introduced that make up the hidden sector and a new scalar @xmath10 is added .",
    "the new states are singlets under the sm gauge group @xmath11 .",
    "an extra @xmath6 gauge group is also assumed under which both sm fields and hidden sector ones are charged , and so by construction the associated gauge boson mediates between the sm and hv sectors .",
    "@xmath12 & @xmath13 & @xmath14 & @xmath15 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath10 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 + @xmath23 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath24 & @xmath23 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 +    a simple way to ensure the cancellation of anomalies associated with the @xmath1 is to choose the @xmath1 charges for the sm fields to be those of the family independent @xmath32 subgroup of a @xmath33 gut , as shown in table  [ charges1 ] . as discussed in appendix  [ appendix0 ] this model",
    "may be considered a low energy realisation of a theory with @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "however , we do not restrict the analysis to be consistent with @xmath33 unification , but this may be recovered as a special case .",
    "it follows with the particle content and @xmath1 charge assignment in table  [ charges1 ] that the  un - unified \" hv model is still gauge anomaly free .",
    "other @xmath1 extensions are possible and will bring different numerical limits on the model parameters compared to those presented in sections  [ cz ] and  [ dmc ] .",
    "however , as we shall see , the qualitative features of the allowed parameter space found are universal .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath10 is responsible for generating a mass for the @xmath4 which we will find is of @xmath34 . to allow for right",
    "handed neutrinos masses we choose @xmath35 .",
    "one constraint on the hidden valley model which must be satisfied is the upper bound on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "this can be satisfied by ensuring that there is a sufficient mass gap for the new states that this model introduces . in the hidden sector",
    ", interactions other than @xmath6 that are restricted to this sector can also exist .",
    "we assume as in @xcite that there is a confining @xmath36 qcd - like interaction with the hv fermions in the fundamental representation and with a confinement scale @xmath37 . if @xmath38 , a sufficient mass gap would be provided to satisfy the bbn constraint .",
    "this hierarchy can naturally set the mass scale of the hv states to be significantly different from that of sm states , using arguments similar to those in technicolour models .",
    "the spectrum of bound states is discussed in section  [ qcdlike ] .    to allow current masses for the hv fermions via the higgs mechanism ,",
    "the condition @xmath39 must be satisfied .",
    "the field @xmath10 can then also act as a mediator between the sm and hv sector , via interactions with the sm higgs of the form @xmath40 .",
    "this term produces mass mixing terms between the scalars as well , after breaking the @xmath1 and electroweak symmetry .",
    "the use of a scalar mediator ( also known as the `` higgs portal '' ) has received recent attention in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we expect that mediation via the higgs portal is negligible due to small yukawa couplings , and the large mass for the @xmath10 , with the resultant small higgs-@xmath10 mixing , making the @xmath0 interactions dominant .",
    "indeed the higgs portal can be ignored completely in this model if the hv fermions current masses are entirely generated from instanton effects after spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . alternatively , if @xmath41 , mass terms for the hv fermions are unprotected by gauge symmetries and they do not couple directly to the fundamental scalar fields .",
    "the addition of the @xmath1 gauge boson to the sm introduces interesting physics by itself @xcite .",
    "the discussion here , and in section  [ cz ] for the limits on the @xmath0 from corrections to sm processes , is independent of the details of the hidden sector physics . in the most general case",
    ", the lagrangian can contain a term that leads to kinetic mixing between the abelian gauge fields @xmath42 and @xmath1 : @xmath43    the presence of kinetic mixing and mass mixing terms changes the currents coupling to the gauge fields from that expected in the sm . since the new scalar , @xmath10 , is a singlet under @xmath11 , the only unbroken abelian symmetry after @xmath1 and electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )",
    "is that associated with electric charge conservation , generating the usual structure for electromagnetism .",
    "thus , the physical photon has the same couplings as in the sm , and there is no milli-(electrically)-charged matter in this model at the tree level .",
    "after ewsb , an @xmath44 term is generated by loops .",
    "for @xmath1 couplings in the perturbative regime , this term is negligible for the following analysis .",
    "the currents @xmath45 , which include the relevant coupling constants , associated with the canonically normalised gauge boson mass and kinetic eigenstates of the model are related to sm and @xmath1 currents @xmath46 as follows ( see appendix  a for details ) : @xmath47 @xmath48 the @xmath49 angle accounts for the rotation necessary to diagonalise the mass matrix , after kinetic mixing has been removed by a field redefinition . note that if @xmath50 , the coupling to the physical @xmath51 is identical to the sm case , but the @xmath0 coupling still varies with the kinetic mixing @xmath52 .",
    "it is therefore not necessary for any sm particles to be charged under the @xmath1 for the physical @xmath0 to mediate between the sm and hv sectors as this could be achieved by the presence of kinetic mixing alone . in eq  ( [ jtrans ] ) ,",
    "the weinberg angle is defined as @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in eq  ( [ delta ] ) is the @xmath1 charge of the sm higgs field .",
    "the tree - level mass of the physical @xmath51 deviates from the sm prediction : @xmath55 the presence of a local @xmath1 symmetry thus affects  low energy \" electroweak physics whose parameters have been measured very accurately .",
    "the impact of experimental measurements on the mixing parameters , @xmath4 mass , @xmath1 coupling constant and matter charges are analysed in detail in section  [ cz ] .",
    "let us now address the details of the physics of the hidden sector .",
    "we consider the case that the hv matter is confined by the strong dynamics of an unbroken gauge symmetry in the hidden sector .",
    "we review the behaviour of such qcd - like theories where the elementary matter fields are vector - like pairs of fermions and note some possible differences with sm qcd phenomenology . here",
    "we focus on the lightest composite states since , if stable , these could be the dominant dark matter candidates .",
    "the experimental constraints on the hidden valley model with a dark matter candidate are discussed in section  [ dmc ] .",
    "the lagrangian with elementary fermions in the fundamental representation of a confining @xmath36 symmetry ( @xmath56 ) includes the terms : @xmath57 { \\cal{l}_{\\mbox{\\tiny hv fermion}}^ { } } & = &   \\bar{\\psi}_l^ { } \\ ,   i   ~ { \\ensuremath   \\raisebox{0.025cm}{\\slash}\\hspace{-0.32 cm } d}\\ , \\psi_l^ { } + \\bar{\\psi}_r^ { }   \\ ,   i ~ { \\ensuremath   \\raisebox{0.025cm}{\\slash}\\hspace{-0.32 cm } d}\\ , \\psi_r^ { } - \\bar{\\psi}_r^ { } \\ , m \\ ,   \\psi_l^ { } - \\bar{\\psi}_l^ { } \\ , m^\\dagger     \\ , \\psi_r^ { } \\label{hvf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the field strength of the hv - confined gauge field , and chiral multiplets ( @xmath59 ) have been formed out of the left- and right - handed weyl fermions ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "the effect of choosing a basis where the transformed mass matrix , @xmath63 , is real and positive semi - definite , is to shift the @xmath64 parameter : @xmath65 while in the sm sector , @xmath66 , in the present case nothing prevents @xmath67 from taking values of order @xmath7 .",
    "this term explicitly violates cp symmetry unless @xmath68 .",
    "the dynamics of the confined matter can be modelled using an effective theory built to possess the conserved and approximate symmetries , as detailed in the following .",
    "the kinetic terms of @xmath69 are invariant under independent transformations of the left- and right - handed multiplets .",
    "thus , there is a global @xmath70 symmetry , where @xmath71 is the number of hv fermion flavours .",

    "if the current masses are not degenerate , the final symmetry is @xmath73^{n}$ ] .",
    "if there were no fermion masses , the axial symmetry would be spontaneously broken by the v - quark condensate whilst still preserving the vector symmetries .",
    "thus , if there are @xmath74 fermions whose current masses are much smaller than the confinement scale , then it is a good approximation to assume that the chiral symmetry of the kinetic term is first explicitly broken to @xmath75^{(n - n^\\prime)}$ ] , and then spontaneously broken to @xmath76^{(n -   n^\\prime)}$ ] .",
    "the strong interaction is flavour blind in the limit of zero current masses , so does not spontaneously break the vector symmetry further .",
    "the pseudo - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the approximate axial symmetry are the analogues of the pions , kaons , eta and eta primed mesons in qcd .",
    "it is convenient to use chiral perturbation theory which is an expansion in terms of the explicit symmetry breaking parameter , @xmath77 , to model the pseudo - goldstone boson composite states .",

    "the lightest hv state was found to annihilate close to the @xmath0 resonance , restricting it to have an @xmath131(tev ) mass .",
    "future direct dark matter searches will also significantly probe the currently allowed dark matter parameter space .",
    "the inclusion of the sommerfeld effect for p - wave annihilations of the spin  0 dark matter via a spin  1 state brought a significant change to the annihilation cross section .",

    "recently , its importance has been pointed out for cosmological calculations of thermal relics , and the indirect detection of dark matter @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative physics can be thought of as the limit of perturbative feynman diagrams , with an infinite number of particle exchanges . for 2-body scattering",
    "this involves a  ladder \" diagram .",
    "the solution of the non - perturbative vertex function , @xmath277 , is given by the bethe - salpeter equation :        @xmath278 where @xmath279 are  compact \" vertices which do not involve any intermediate state composed solely of the scattering particles , and @xmath280 is the non - perturbative propagator .",
    "the inhomogeneous integral equation for @xmath277 can be solved to arbitrary accuracy , given that @xmath279 and the propagator are sufficiently well known from perturbative calculations .",
    "the finite ladders can be neglected when near the poles of the scattering states , which leads to the non - perturbative nature of this effect and a homogeneous integral equation . for an annihilation process as shown in fig  [ annpic ] , the matrix element for the diagram with the ladder is related to the one without a ladder as given below :        @xmath281 where the bethe - salpeter wavefunction , @xmath282 , is introduced in the centre of momentum frame , and the intermediate scattering particles are taken on - shell .",
    "it follows that for non - relativistic processes , the bethe - salpeter wavefunction is equivalent to the solution of the schrdinger equation with a potential that accounts for the scattering interactions @xcite . for central potentials ,",
    "the spherical harmonic basis is convenient for solving the schrdinger equation : @xmath283 the fourier transform of eq  ( [ sphh ] ) is determined below : @xmath284 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & y_{l m}^ { } ( \\theta_k^ { } , \\phi_k^ { } ) \\left [   i^{l }   \\ , 4 \\pi    \\int_0^\\infty r^2 \\ , j_{l}^ { } ( kr ) \\ , r_{el}^ { } ( r ) \\ , dr \\right ]    \\nonumber \\\\[9pt ] & \\equiv & y_{l m}^ { } ( \\theta_k^ { } , \\phi_k^ { } ) ~ f_{el}^ { } ( k)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is therefore useful to decompose the matrix element in the same orthonormal momentum space basis to calculate eq  ( [ mladd ] ) .",
    "the weighting of the components of the bethe - salpeter wavefunction with different ( @xmath285 ) quantum numbers is determined by the matrix element .",
    "if @xmath286 is expressed as a polynomial in @xmath287 , the result of integration of the wavefunction weighted by extra powers of @xmath287 needs to be found .",
    "this can be done by considering derivatives of the position space radial wavefunction and the inverse fourier transform relation : @xmath288 f_{e l}^ { } ( k ) ~dk\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using a series expansion of the spherical bessel function , then @xmath289 suppose the full matrix element is dominated by the contribution of one term in @xmath290 , where n is some non - negative integer . in this case , the cross section which accounts for the ladder is related by an overall factor to the cross section calculated from diagrams without the ladder @xmath291 , valid in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "@xmath292 is called the sommerfeld factor , with the value : @xmath293 it is common to ignore the effect present for non - zero angular momentum processes , arguing that the angular momentum barrier always suppresses higher partial wave processes .",
    "however , if s - wave interactions are small compared to higher partial wave processes , as when scalars annihilate via a heavy vector , this argument is not always applicable .      the reduced schrdinger radial equation for a two - body system of particles each with mass @xmath89 , and a coulomb potential is as follows : @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the speed of each particle when at infinite separation in the centre of mass frame .",

    "however , in the limit of small velocities ( large @xmath173 ) the sommerfeld factor for a coulomb interaction fixes each partial wave to have the same velocity dependence .",
    "the schrdinger equation with a yukawa potential is related to the coulomb case as follows : @xmath301 where @xmath302 is the mass of the mediator .",
    "the sommerfeld factor for the @xmath303 case has been presented by cirelli , strumia and tamburini  @xcite .",
    "figure  d - iii shows the @xmath304 case ( n=0 ) , where numerical simulations have been used to find the wavefunction .      for small @xmath133 , the sommerfeld factor gets closer to unity as the angular momentum increases .",
    "this is because as the interaction is screened beyond some short distance , the increased angular momentum barrier becomes more efficient at keeping the wavefunction away from this core . for a repulsive yukawa interaction",

    "so , although higher partial waves may be neglected at a perturbative level , this ladder effect could cause them to become significant or even dominant .",
    "however , for attractive interactions , the larger angular momentum processes are enhanced less , so higher partial wave terms which are negligible in the perturbative expansion stay negligible .",
    "there is always some reduction in the velocity dependent factor of the partial wave cross sections , in going to higher partial waves for non - zero @xmath295 , but the @xmath305 suppression is only found for large velocities . for the attractive yukawa potential , @xmath304",
    "bound states exist when @xmath306 .",
    "the system can be close to the breit - wigner tails of these resonances when the relative velocity is small , and the sommerfeld factor reflects this . in the limit @xmath307 , the coulomb potential is approached , so the discussion in the previous subsection is relevant .",
