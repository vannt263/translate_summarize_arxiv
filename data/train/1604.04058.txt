    "the study of the geometric and topological properties of extreme sample clouds in a high - dimensional space belongs to extreme value theory ( evt ) .",
    "indeed , over the last decade or so , many studies have provided geometric descriptions of multivariate extremes in view of point process theory , among them @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in particular ,",
    "poisson limits of point processes with a u - statistic structure were discussed in @xcite and @xcite , the latter also including a number of stochastic geometry examples .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite a recent extensive study of the general point process convergence of extreme sample clouds , leading to limit theorems for betti numbers of extremes , is reported .",

    "more formally , this ring - like structure is referred to as _ topological crackle _ , which was originally reported in @xcite .",
    "we remark also that there has been increasing interest in the limiting behaviors of random simplicial complexes , which are not necessarily related to extremes ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these papers derive various limit theorems for the betti numbers of the random ech complexes @xmath62 , with @xmath63 a random point set in @xmath0 and @xmath64 a threshold radius decreasing to @xmath8 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",

    "we observe that the nature of limit theorems for the lifetime sum of extremes depends crucially on the distance of the region of interest from the origin .",
    "the asymptotics of the lifetime sum exhibits completely different topological features according to the region examined .",
    "the persistent homology originated in algebraic topology , and thus , there are only a limited number of probabilistic and statistical studies that have treated it .",

    "this is , however , a little more technical and challenging , and therefore , we decided to concentrate on the simpler setup of an inhomogeneous poisson point process .",
