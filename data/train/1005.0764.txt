    "a spinfoam sum over a given two - complex @xmath0 , formed by faces @xmath1 joining along edges @xmath2 in turn meeting at vertices @xmath3 , is defined by the expression z_= _ j_f , i_e  _ f d_j_f  _ v a_v(j_f , i_e ) , [ z ] where @xmath4 is the  vertex amplitude \" and @xmath5 is the  face amplitude \" .",
    "the sum is over an assignment @xmath6 of an irreducible representation of a compact group @xmath7 to each face @xmath1 and of an intertwiner @xmath8 to each edge @xmath2 of the two - complex .",
    "the expression is often viewed as a possible foundation for a background independent quantum theory of gravity @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a vertex amplitude @xmath4 that might define a quantum theory of gravity has been developed in @xcite and is today under intense investigation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but what about the  measure factor \" given by the face amplitude @xmath5 ? what determines it ?",
    "the uncertainty in determining the face amplitude has been repeatedly remarked @xcite .",
    "one way of fixing the face amplitude which can be found in the literature , for example , is to derive the sum for general relativity ( gr ) starting from the analogous sum for a topological @xmath9 theory , and then implementing the constraints that reduce @xmath9 to gr as suitable constraints on the states summed over .",
    "for instance , in the euclidean context gr is a constrained @xmath10 @xmath9 theory .",
    "the state sum is well understood for @xmath10 @xmath9 theory : its face amplitude is the dimension of the @xmath10 representation @xmath11 .",
    "the simplicity constraint fixes this to be of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the barbero - immirzi parameter , and therefore d_j_f = ( 2j_++1)(2j_-+1)=(2_+j_f+1)(2_-j_f+1 ) .",
    "[ bffa ] however , doubts can be raised against this argument .",
    "for instance , alexandrov @xcite has stressed the fact that the implementation of second class constraints into a feynman path integral in general requires a modification of the measure , and here the face amplitude plays precisely the role of such measure , since @xmath15 .",
    "do we have an independent way of fixing the face amplitude ?    here",
    "we argue that the face amplitude is uniquely determined for any spinfoam sum of the form by three inputs : ( a ) the choice of the boundary hilbert space , ( b ) the requirement that the composition law holds when gluing two - complexes ; and ( c ) a particular  locality \" requirement , or , more precisely , a requirement on the local composition of group elements .",
    "we argue below that these requirements are implemented if @xmath16 is given by the expression z_=du_f^v   _ v a_v(u_f^v )  _ f  ( u_f^v_1 ...",
    "u_f^v_k ) , [ main ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the vertices surrounding the face @xmath1 , and @xmath19 is the vertex amplitude @xmath4 expressed in the group element basis @xcite .",
    "then we show that this expression leads directly to , with arbitrary vertex amplitude , but a fixed choice of face amplitude , which turns out to be the dimension of the representation @xmath20 of the group @xmath7 , d_j= dim(j ) .",
    "[ d ] in particular , for quantum gravity this implies that the @xmath9 face amplitude is ruled out , and should be replaced ( both in the euclidean and in the lorentzian case ) by the @xmath21 dimension d_j= 2j+1 .",
    "equation is the key expression of this paper ; we begin by showing that @xmath10 bf theory ( the prototypical spinfoam model ) can be expressed in this form ( section [ bfsec ] ) .",
    "then we discuss the three requirements above and we show that implements these requirements . ( section [ inputs ] ) .",
    "finally we show that gives with the face amplitude ( section iv ) .",
    "the problem of fixing the face amplitude has been discussed also by bojowald and perez in @xcite .",
    "bojowald and perez demand that the amplitude be invariant under suitable refinements of the two - complex .",
    "this request is strictly related to the composition law that we consider here , and the results we obtain are consistent with those of @xcite .",

    "then we can trivially rewrite as z_=dh_ve _ f  ( ( h_v_1e_1 h^-1_v_2 e_1 )  ...  ( h_v_k e_k h^-1_v_1 e_k ) ) .",
    "[ zbf3 ] now define the group elements u_f^v = h^-1_ve h_ve associated to a single vertex @xmath3 and two edges @xmath2 and @xmath27 that emerge from @xmath3 and bound the face @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . using these ,",

    "then we require that @xmath54 satisfies the composition law z__1_2=__2|w__1 , as discussed by atiyah in @xcite .",

    "similarly , the vertex amplitude can be expanded in the group element basis a_v(u_f^v)&=&_f^v|a_v [ va ] + & = & _ j_f^v , i_n^v ( dim(j_f^v ) )  _ j_f^v , i_n^v(u_f^v ) a_v(j_f^v , i_n^v).notice that here the group element @xmath55 and the spin @xmath56 are associated to a vertex @xmath3 and a face @xmath1 adjacent to @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the intertwiner @xmath57 is associated to a vertex @xmath3 and a node @xmath31 adjacent to @xmath3 .",
    "consider a boundary link @xmath30 that bounds a face @xmath1 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath18 be the vertices that are adjacent to this face .",
    "we say that the model is local if the relation between the boundary group element @xmath58 and the vertices group elements @xmath55 is given by u_l = u_f^v_1 ...  u_f^v_k .",
    "[ locality ] in other words : if the boundary group element is simply the product of the group elements around the face .",
    "notice that a spinfoam model defined by is local and satisfies composition law in the sense above .",
    "in fact , generalizes immediately to w_(u_l)&=&du_f^v   _ v a_v(u_f^v )  _ internal  f  ( u_f^v_1 ...",
    "u_f^v_k ) + & &  _ external  f  ( u_f^v_1 ... u_f^v_ku^-1_l ) .",
    "[ main2 ] here the first product over @xmath1 is over the (  internal \" ) faces that do not have an external boundary ; while the second is over the (  external \" ) faces @xmath1 that are also bounded by the vertices @xmath59 and by the the link @xmath30 .",
    "it is immediate to see that locality is implemented , since the second delta enforces the locality condition .",
    "furthermore , when gluing two amplitudes along a common boundary we have immediately that du_l  w__2(u_l)=z__1_2 because the two delta functions containing @xmath58 collapse into a single delta function associated to the face @xmath30 , which becomes internal .",
    "thus , is a general form of the amplitude where these conditions hold .    in @xcite , bojowald and perez",
    "have considered the possibility of fixing the face amplitude by requiring the amplitude of a given spin / intertwiner configuration to be equal to the amplitude of the same spin / intertwiner configuration on a finer two - simplex where additional faces carry the trivial representation .",
    "this requirement imply essentially that the amplitude does not change by splitting a face into two faces .",
    "it is easy to see that satisfies this condition .",
    "therefore satisfies also the bojowald - perez condition .",
    "finally , let us show that implies _ and _ . to this purpose , it is sufficient to insert into .",
    "this gives z_&=&du_f^v   _ v _ j_f^v , i_n^v ( dim(j_f^v ) )  _ j_f^v , i_n^v(u_f^v ) a_v(j_f^v , i_n^v ) + & &   _ f  ( u_f^v_1 ... u_f^v_k ) . [ main22 ] expand then the delta function in a sum over characters z_&=&du_f^v   _ v _ j_f^v , i_n^v ( dim(j_f^v ) )  _ j_f^v , i_n^v(u_f^v ) a_v(j_f^v , i_n^v ) + & &   _ f  _ j_fdim(j_f )  tr(r^j_f(u_f^v_1)r^j_f(u_f^v_k ) ) .",
    "we can now perform the group integrals .",
    "each @xmath55 appears precisely twice in the integral : once in the sum over @xmath56 and the other in the sum over @xmath6 . each integration gives a delta function @xmath60 , which can be used to kill the sum over @xmath56 dropping the @xmath3 subscript .",
    "following the contraction path of the indices , it is easy to see that these contract the two intertwiners at the opposite side of each edge .",
    "since intertwiners are orthonormal , this gives a delta function @xmath61 which reduces the sums over intertwiners to a single sum over @xmath62 .",
    "bringing everything together , and noticing that the @xmath43 factor from the group integrations cancels the one in the integral , we have z_=_j_f i_n  _ f dim(j_f )  _ v a_v(j_f^v , i_n^v ) .",
    "this is precisely equation , with the face amplitude given by .",
    "notice that the face amplitude is well defined , in the sense that it can not be absorbed into the vertex amplitude ( as any _ edge _ amplitude can ) .",
    "the reason is that any factor in the vertex amplitude depending on the spin of the face contributes to the total amplitude at a power @xmath63 , where @xmath63 is the number of sides of the face .",
    "the face amplitude , instead , is a contribution to the total amplitude that does not depend on @xmath63 .",
    "this is also the reason why the normalization chosen for the spinfoam basis does not affect the present discussion : it affects the expression for the vertex amplitude , not that for the face amplitude .    by an analogous calculation",
    "one can show that the same result holds for the amplitudes @xmath54 : equation follows from expanded on a spin network basis .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the general form of the partition function , which implements locality and the composition law , implies that the face amplitude of the spinfoam model is given by the dimension of the representation of the group @xmath7 which appears in the boundary scalar product ( [ n ] ) .    in general relativity , in both the euclidean and the lorentzian cases ,",
    "the boundary space is _ & = & l_2[su(2)^l , du_l ] , therefore the face amplitude is @xmath64 , and not the @xmath10 dimension , as previously supposed .",
    "notice that such @xmath65 amplitude defines a theory that is far less divergent than the theory defined by .",
    "in fact , the potential divergence of a bubble is suppressed by a power of @xmath20 with respect to . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the @xmath65 face amplitude yields a _ finite _ main radiative correction to a five - valent vertex if all external legs set to zero .",
