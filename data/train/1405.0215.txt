    "<S> this clearly demonstrates the effect due to feedback dynamics from photon - dressed electron - hole ( e - h ) plasma inside quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this unique observation in the scattering field spectrum is proven to be correlated with a resonant dip observed in the absorption spectrum@xcite of surface plasmon - polariton waves which can be directly attributed to an effect of the inter - band photon - dressing of electronic states .    </S>",

    "<S> the quantum kinetics of electrons in photo - excited quantum dots should be adequately described by the so - called semiconductor bloch equations@xcite which are a generalization of the well - known optical bloch equations in two ways , namely the incorporation of electron scattering by impurities , phonons and other electrons , as well as the many - body effects on dephasing in the photo - induced optical coherence .    for photo - excited spin - degenerate electrons ( holes ) in the conduction ( valence ) band , </S>",

    "<S> a dip is observed at resonance @xmath97 in the upper - left panel , which becomes deeper with decreasing amplitude @xmath21 of the spp wave in the strong - coupling regime due to a reduction of saturated absorption . </S>",
    "<S> however , this dip disappears when @xmath21 drops to @xmath98kv / cm in the weak - coupling limit due to the suppression of the photon dressing effect , which is accompanied by a one - order of magnitude increase in the absorption - peak strength . </S>",
    "<S> the dip in the upper - left panel corresponds to a peak in the scattering field , as may be seen from the upper - right panel of this figure . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering field increases with the frequency detuning away from resonance , corresponding to decreasing absorption . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , two local minima appear on both sides of resonance for the scattering field in the strong - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> maxwell - bloch equations couple the field dynamics outside a quantum dot with the electron dynamics inside the dot . at @xmath99kv </S>",
    "<S> / cm in the lower - right - hand panel , we obtain peaks in energy - level occupations at resonance , which are broadened by the finite carrier lifetime as well as the optical power of the spp wave . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , jumps in the energy level occupation may be seen at resonance due to rabi splitting of the energy levels in the dressed electron states . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of resonant phonon absorption also plays a significant role in the finite value of @xmath100 with energy - level separations @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath21 decreases to @xmath98kv / cm in the lower - left panel , peaks in the energy - level occupations are greatly sharpened and negatively shifted due to the suppression of the broadening from the optical power and the excitonic effect , respectively . additionally , jumps in the energy level occupations become invisible because the rabi - split energy gap in this case is much smaller than the energy - level broadening from the finite lifetime of electrons ( i.e. , substantially dampened rabi oscillations between the first electron and hole levels ) .    </S>",
    "<S> although the interband dipole moment of a quantum dot is isotropic in space , the scattering field ( see fig.[f2 ] with @xmath102kv / cm ) in the @xmath69 direction ( upper panel ) and in the @xmath103 direction ( lower panel ) are still different due to the presence of a metallic surface perpendicular to the @xmath103 direction in our system . </S>",
    "<S> however , this isotropic intensity distribution is mostly recovered at @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the scattering field in the @xmath103 direction is one order of magnitude larger than that in the @xmath69 direction . the field pattern in the lower panel tends to spread in the @xmath103 direction , while the pattern in the upper panel distributes in the @xmath69 direction . from this figure </S>",
    "<S> , we also find that the intensities in both panels follow the pattern of strong - weak - strong - weak - strong as the frequency detuning is swept across @xmath104 , which agrees with the observation of the scattering field at the quantum dot in the upper - right panel of fig.[f1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> color maps for the scattering field around a quantum dot displayed in fig.[f2 ] are for strong coupling between the dot and an spp wave . </S>",
    "<S> we present in fig.[f3 ] the scattering field maps in the weak - coupling regime , where the strong - weak - strong - weak - strong pattern in the strong - coupling regimes has been changed to a weak - strong - weak pattern . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spp - wave frequency for the resonant scattering field has been shifted from @xmath104 to @xmath105mev , demonstrating a positive depolarization shift of the optical excitation energy , as may be verified from the upper left - hand panel of fig.[f1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , this depolarization effect is completely masked by the occurrence of a local minimum at @xmath102kv / cm .    in conclusion , for a strong spp wave , we have demonstrated the unique effect of its resonant scattering by a dynamical semiconductor quantum dot very close to the metal / dielectric interface . </S>",
    "<S> we have also predicted correlation between a resonant peak in the scattering field spectrum and a resonant local minimum in the absorption spectrum of the spp wave .    in this letter , we only investigated the coupling between an spp wave and a single quantum dot for the simplest case . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism may be generalized in a straightforward way to include multiple quantum dots close to the surface of a metallic film . </S>",
    "<S> the open surface of the metallic film provides an easy solution to perform biochemical and biomedical tests under a microscope in a laboratory setting . </S>",
    "<S> if the quantum dots are further coated with specially - selected chemically - reactive molecules , they should be expected to be able to adhere to special target tissue if the chemical properties are matched with each other . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the spontaneous emission by electrons in these quantum dots may be employed non - invasively for near - field imaging of target tissue with very high brightness and spatial resolution .    additionally , instead of coupling to the lowest pair of e - h energy levels </S>",
    "<S> , we may choose the surface plasmon frequency for a resonant coupling to the next pair of e - h levels . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , optical pumping from the localized surface plasmon field may transfer a population inversion from the excited pair to the ground pair of e - h levels by exchanging thermal energy with lattice phonons , leading to a possible lasing action . </S>",
    "<S> such a surface plasmon based quantum - dot laser would have a beam size as small as a few nanometers ( not limited by its wavelength ) , which is expected to be very useful to spatially selective illumination of individual molecules ( neuron cells ) in low - temperature photo - excited chemical reactions ( optogenetics and neuroscience ) .    </S>",
