    "we consider a particle coupled to a model heat bath of the zwanzig form @xcite , described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are coordinate and momentum operators of the brownian particle , @xmath11 is the set of co - ordinate and momentum operators for the heat - bath oscillators , and @xmath12 is the harmonic confining potential .",
    "the potential @xmath13 arises from the external force field .",
    "the co - ordinate and momentum operators follow the usual commutation relations @xmath14 eliminating the reservoir degrees of freedom @xcite , we obtain the operator gqle corresponding to hamiltonian ( 1 ) : @xmath15 where noise operator @xmath16 , memory kernel @xmath17 and external force @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 our aim is to replace the exact gqle in operator form eq .",
    "( 3 ) by its @xmath6-number equivalent . to achieve this ,",
    "we follow the method of banerjee _ _",
    "@xcite and introduce product separable quantum states to describe the initial @xmath20 state of the particle and the bath oscillators , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes any arbitrary initial state of the particle and @xmath23 corresponds to the initial coherent state of the @xmath24th oscillator . here",
    "@xmath23 is given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is expressed in terms of the variables of the coordinate and momentum of the @xmath24th oscillator @xmath27 following @xcite and doing the quantum - statistical averaging starting from the intial product separable quantum state ( eq .",
    "7 ) , one obtains the @xmath6-number gqle : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are quantum fluctuation terms , given by : @xmath32 in order that @xmath33 be an effective @xmath6-number noise , we must have @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes statistical average over the initial distribution of the mean values of the momenta and co - ordinates of the bath oscillators . equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) imply that @xmath36 is centered around zero and satisfies the quantum fluctuation - dissipation relation , and are obtained if and only if the initial quantum mechanical mean values of momenta and co - ordinates of the bath oscillators have the following distribution @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , the average thermal phonon number at temperature @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the statistical average of any quantum mechanical mean value @xmath40 is defined as @xmath41 using equations ( 12 ) , ( 17 ) , and ( 18 ) , one can easily show the properties ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) of the c - number noise .",
    "@xmath42 is a canonical wigner distribution for a displaced harmonic oscillator and always remains positive @xcite .",
    "now , one can interpret equation ( 11 ) as a @xmath6-number gqle which is governed by a @xmath6-number noise @xmath33 originating from the heat bath characterized by the properties ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) .",
    "the two quantum fluctuation terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 originate from the nonlinearity of the confining potential @xmath45 and the externally applied rapidly oscillating potential @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "in this section , we discuss the derivation of the quantum terms @xmath47 and @xmath48 . based on the quantum nature of the system , one can write @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 . then , making a taylor series expansion around @xmath52 in eqs . ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , one obtains @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the @xmath56th derivatives of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 depend on the quantum factors @xmath57 whose evaluation is discussed below . + substituting eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 20 ) into eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 . +",
    "we now consider the case of a harmonic confining potential @xmath60 , in which case the derivatives in eq .",
    "( 21 ) vanish , implying @xmath61 . with rapid",
    "driving , excursions around the smooth part are small , so that for our purpose of deriving the leading order term , we may replace @xmath62 by @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes an average in the absence of driving .",
    "thus , we have @xmath65 equation ( 23 ) then reduces to @xmath66 equation ( 25 ) may be solved by laplace transformations , leading to @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the inverse laplace transforms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively given by @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the laplace transform of the frictional kernel @xmath17 . equation ( 26 ) then leads to @xmath74 let us choose initial conditions corresponding to minimum uncertainty states @xcite : , so that @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . in order to find @xmath69 and @xmath68 ( or equivalently @xmath71 and @xmath70 )",
    ", we need to know @xmath17 .",
    "we make the customary choice of an ohmic heat bath , which leads to @xmath78 and finally to an explicit forms for @xmath69 and @xmath68 . in the underdamped regime ( @xmath79 )",
    ", we find @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "for the overdamped case ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 becomes imaginary and @xmath69 and @xmath68 are modified to @xmath84 where @xmath85 . + with the ohmic condition for the heat bath , @xmath78 , the double integral in equation ( 30 ) can be evaluated with the result @xmath86 it reduces to a simple form for time large compared to @xmath87 : @xmath88 in the limit of weak damping ( @xmath89 ) , eq .",
    "( 35 ) reduces to @xmath90 while with strong damping ( @xmath91 ) , we obtain @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the euler s constant . when substituted in eq .",
    "( 24 ) , these answers for @xmath94 determine the leading order form of the quantum fluctuation term eq .",
    "in this section we show that on time scales larger than the period of driving , the leading order efffect is to produce an effective potential which has an additive quantum dissipative term @xmath0 whose form is derived below ( eq .",
    "+ for the harmonic confining potential and ohmic dissipative bath , we have seen that the operator gqle reduces to @xmath95 if @xmath33 is delta correlated as it is for an ohmic dissipative bath , one can show that the noise term does not enter the effective hamiltonian to leading order @xcite .",
    "now , following the kll approach @xcite one can write @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the slow coordinate and rapidly oscillating coordinate respectively . inserting eq .",
    "( 39 ) in eq .",
    "( 38 ) , we obtain @xmath99 equation ( 40 ) contains both slow and fast part and they must be separately equal .",
    "thus @xmath100 for @xmath101 , we may choose @xmath102 now , putting eq .",
    "( 42 ) in eq .",
    "( 40 ) and averaging over one time - period ( which is denoted by subscript @xmath103 ) of the external field , we obtain @xmath104 now , @xmath105 @xmath106 since the term in square bracket is independent of time ( see eq .",
    "( 35 ) ) , we obtain @xmath107 . in the same manner",
    "one can show that in the limit of large @xmath108 @xmath109 where we have replaced @xmath110 by its equilibrium value @xmath111 . finally , one can write down the effective equation of motion for the slow variable as follows @xmath112 where @xmath113 @xmath114 with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "finally , the quantum contribution is given by : @xmath117 equation ( 50 ) embodies the leading order quantum correction . in the classical limit ,",
    "@xmath0 vanishes and the effective potential reduces to @xmath118 , which is the result of @xcite .",
    "we also note that in the absence of dissipation @xmath119 , both @xmath4 and @xmath0 vanish and the effective potential reduces to @xmath120 , consistent with the results of @xcite . finally , in the limit of very high dissipation @xmath121 , the quantum correction is negligible as is evident from eq .",
    "thus , we conclude that the effects of quantum dissipative contribution are largest for intermediate values of damping .",
    "+ to illustrate the evolution of the form of @xmath122 as the damping is varied , we consider a system which is perturbed by an oscillatory potential with a gaussian profile i.e. @xmath123 .",
    "the effective potential then has the following parts : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the incomplete gamma function and @xmath126 .",
    "the above equations are expressed in terms of dimensionless variables @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "figures ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) depicts the effective potential profile in the low , intermediate and high damping cases respectively . as remarked in the previous paragraph",
    ", we see that the effects of @xmath0 are most pronounced at intermediate values of the damping .",
    "the presence of higher order derivatives of space dependent terms of forcing in the quantum dissipative part , @xmath0 , brings in some interesting changes in the qualitative form of the effective potential .",
    "it is evident from figure ( 1 ) that in the absence of dissipation the effective potential has two metastable minima and one stable minimum .",
    "but , on adding @xmath0 two metastable states become stable minima and the stable minimum becomes a maximum . +",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the properties of a quantum particle in a harmonic potential , coupled to a dissipative ohmic heat bath , in the presence of a space dependent rapidly oscillating field .",
    "starting from the usual heat - bath reservoir model , we obtained a @xmath6-number gqle from the operator equivalent by using a coherent state representation of bath oscillators @xcite .",
    "this enabled us to apply the kapitza idea of separating into a slow part and a fast part , which consists of the rapid oscillations around the slow motion .",
    "the resulting equation for the slow motion is treated perturbatively . to leading order",
    ", we find that the rapid forcing leads to an effective static potential which has a quantum contribution , @xmath0 , which adds to the classical result .",
    "this quantum contribution vanishes for both very small and very large values of the damping , but can have an appreciable and interesting effects for intermediate values .",
    "for instance , the number of stable minima in the effective potential can change , as illustrated by the case of a gaussian oscillating force , for moderate values of the damping .",
