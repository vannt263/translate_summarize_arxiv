    "all @xmath7-hadrons are produced at the tevatron ( unlike the @xmath7 factories ) , the drawback being the inelastic cross section which is 1000@xmath16 making online data selection crucial .",
    "the cdf  @xcite and d0 detectors  @xcite have been described elsewhere . in order to utilize the high @xmath11 production cross section clean signatures of @xmath7 hadron decays must be used when selecting data online . during run - i cdf",
    "used the clean signatures of @xmath17 and the decays of @xmath7 hadrons to high transverse momentum ( @xmath18 ) leptons .",
    "now the long lifetime of @xmath7 hadrons is being utilized at cdf , events containing @xmath192 tracks with high impact parameters ( @xmath20 ) consistent with being daughters of @xmath7 hadrons are selected using the silicon vertex trigger , events selected in this way are categorized as `` hadronic @xmath7 trigger '' or `` displaced track trigger '' events .",
    "another trigger used for @xmath7 selection selects events requires the presence of a single high @xmath18 lepton and a high @xmath20 track , this is called the `` lepton+svt trigger '' or `` lepton+displaced track trigger '' .",
    "the high @xmath20 triggers have allowed cdf to significantly advance its @xmath7 and charm physics capability , now cdf can reconstruct @xmath7 decays to fully hadronic final states as well as use the conventional @xmath21 and high @xmath18 lepton triggers .",
    "the d0 experiment utilizes the @xmath22 signature to select @xmath21s ( which may be prompt or long - lived  coming from @xmath7 hadrons ) .",
    "d0 triggers also use @xmath7 decays to high @xmath18 leptons . with the advent of a magnetic field and a completely new tracking system d0",
    "has acquired a whole new capability in @xmath7 physics and several @xmath23 decay modes have been observed during run - ii .",
    "the d0 experiment is on its way to introducing a hadronic @xmath7 trigger that uses online silicon pattern recognition to select tracks with high @xmath20 , this will be a welcome addition to d0 s already enhanced capability in @xmath7 physics .",
    "precise measurements of lifetimes of @xmath7 hadrons allow tests of the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) which predicts the following hierarchy for @xmath7 hadron lifetimes : @xmath24 . both cdf and d0 are working toward precision tests of this theory",

    "the final state is a mixture of cp eigenstates , and the @xmath2 cp even and odd eigenstates can have a difference in lifetime of upto 10 % as predicted by theory , by fitting a single lifetime in this mode an `` average '' lifetime has been determined .",
    "the relationship between splitting in width ( lifetime ) of the @xmath2 cp eigenstates and the @xmath2 mixing parameter is known in the standard model , therefore a measurement of the width ( lifetime ) difference and mixing parameter provides a test of new physics .",
