    "physics at the lhc is predominantly the physics of multi - particle processes .",
    "substantial efforts have been invested in developing the techniques for computing the amplitudes of such processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one of the difficulties in organizing such computations is in keeping track of all the necessary renormalizations .    in this paper",
    "we present a new approach for computing the multi - particle amplitudes .",
    "its major feature is a separation of the renormalization from the computation .",
    "the idea is that the renormalization is needed only for computing the basic processes involving not more than four particles .",
    "after computing the basic amplitudes , it should be possible to compute the multi - particle amplitudes combining the basic ones , and this combination should not involve any renormalization .",
    "let us compare the new approach to the well - known approach of effective action @xcite .",
    "within the effective action approach , the connected amplitudes are constructed not from the bare action of the model , but from the effective action , which is the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible amplitudes .",
    "the effective action involves nonlocal effective vertexes , and the connected amplitudes are composed from the effective vertexes with tree graphs .",
    "these tree graphs are generated with the inversion of the legendre transform .",
    "the edges of the graphs correspond to exact propagators .",
    "there are infinite sequence of the effective vertexes ordered by the number of external legs of the corresponding one - particle irreducible amplitudes .",
    "the uv renormalization is needed only for computing the effective vertexes and the exact propagators .",
    "in contrast , within the new approach , the connected multi - particle amplitudes are composed not from the bare action , or from the effective action , but from a nonlocal functional of fields which is the generating functional of connected amplitudes with the number of external legs bounded from above .",
    "the exact form of this bound is related to properties of the bare action of the model . in the case of the renormalizable field theories in four space - time dimensions , the connected amplitudes used as effective vertexes involve not more than four external legs .    to stress the difference between the new approach and the approaches employing various actions ,",
    "we call it the inaction approach , and the generating functional of the effective nonlocal vertexes of the new approach , the inaction functional . the inaction functional is a nonlocal polynomial of the fields .    like in the effective action approach",
    ", the uv renormalization is needed within the inaction approach only for computing the inaction functional and the exact propagators .",
    "also , like in the effective action approach , there is a procedure for composing the multi - particle connected amplitudes from the vertexes of the inaction functional and the exact propagator .",
    "this procedure is parallel to the inverse legendre transform of the effective action approach .",
    "we call it the quantum transform",
    ". a crucial difference between the effective action and the inaction approaches is that the quantum transform generates not only the tree graphs , but also graphs with loops .",
    "therefore non - trivial momentum integrations appear as an outcome of the quantum transform .",
    "the above comparison can be summarized as follows : the inaction functional is simpler than the effective action , but the quantum transform is more involved than the inverse legendre transform . in comparison with the bona fide perturbation theory based on the bare action ,",
    "the nonlocal inaction functional is more involved than the bare action , but the quantum transform is in some sense ( see below ) simpler than the conventional feynman rules .",
    "so , the inaction approach lies somewhere in between the bona fide perturbation theory and the effective action perturbation theory .",
    "now we describe the general idea behind the quantum transform . the starting point in deriving the quantum transform",
    "is the dominicis - englert duality between the bare action and the generating functional of connected green s functions @xcite . in particular",
    ", this duality implies that if the generating functional @xmath0 of connected green s functions is given , the bare action functional @xmath1 correponding to this @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of @xmath0 ( here @xmath2 denotes the multicomponent field of the model , and @xmath3 , its source ) .",
    "next , one can express restrictions on the models one considers in the form of the equation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a projector acting in the linear space of field functionals .",
    "substituting in this equation the expression of @xmath1 in terms of @xmath0 one obtains what we call _ an inaction equation _ for connected amplitudes .",
    "the inaction equation can be solved for the part of the generating functional of connected amplitudes in the range of the projector @xmath5 .",
    "the part of this generating functional in the kernel of @xmath5 is used to parameterise the theory .",
    "we called it above the inaction functional . within the inaction approach , the inaction functional can vary without restrictions inside the kernel of @xmath5 .",
    "the solution yields the part of the generating functional of connected amplitudes in the range of @xmath5 as the above quantum transform of the inaction functional .",
    "the quantum transform depends on the projector @xmath5 . requiring the physical results to be independent of",
    "the choice of @xmath5 leads to a particular formulation of the renormalization group equations .",
    "the inaction approach was suggested in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the approach was considered for @xmath6 . in particular",
    ", it was demonstrated that the evolution of the scalar mass described with the inaction renormalization group equation develops a landau pole in the running scalar mass .    in @xcite",
    "the inaction formulation was extended to gauge theories . in unpublished notes",
    "@xcite , a possibility to use the inaction approach beyond perturbation theory is discussed .    in this paper",
    "we consider a particular version of the inaction approach geared to description of multi - particle processes .",
    "it results from a particular choice of the projector annihilating the bare action of the theory .",
    "namely , in this paper , the projector nullifies all powers of the fields up to the fourth power inclusively .",
    "so , the inaction equation @xmath4 is satisfied for any model which bare action is a polynomial of the fields of the fourth power .",
    "accordingly , the inaction functional is a nonlocal polynomial of the fields of the fourth power , and the quantum transform expresses the connected amplitudes involving more than four particles in terms of the inaction functional .",
    "the quantum transform in this case can be represented as a sum of feynman amplitudes whose propagators are the exact propagators of the model , and the vertexes are the connected amplitudes with not more than four external legs .",
    "it implies certain rules for computing the combinatorial weight with which an amplitude contributes to the transform .    as mentioned above",
    ", loop amplitudes appear in the quantum transform . by construction ,",
    "the quantum transform is uv finite for the exact propagator and inaction functional corresponding to a renormalizble theory .",
    "practically , it is of importance to know the mechanism by which this uv finiteness is maintained .",
    "surprisingly , the simplest possible mechanism of this finiteness seems to be in action here : the combinatorial weights for uv dangerous amplitudes which we were able to check are simply zero .",
    "we stress that this fact is not proven as of this moment . below we detail the rules for computing the combinatorial weights appearing in the quantum transform , and give examples of disappearance of some uv dangerous amplitudes .    assuming that this convenient feature holds generally , we have the following rules for computing the multi - particle amplitudes : first",
    ", the propagators and the amplitudes involving not more than four particles are computed with the standard methods up to desired accuracy .",
    "next , the later are taken to be the vertexes , and the former , the lines of the effective feynman rules for computing the multi - particle amplitudes .",
    "last , all the uv divergent amplitudes are thrown away .",
    "we conclude that the quantum transform is simpler than the feynman rules , because it generates less amplitudes ( the uv divergent amplitudes do not appear ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the quantum transform . in the third section",
    ", we describe the combinatorial rules for computing the weights of individual feynman amplitudes in the quantum transform . in the fourth section ,",
    "we give an example of disappearance of the uv dangerous amplitudes in the quantum transform . in the last section ,",
    "we discuss and summarize the results .",
    "the exponential of the generating functional of connected green s functions @xmath0 is expressed in terms of the bare action @xmath1 by the functional fourier transform : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the normalization defined by the condition @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath1 is uv divergent , while @xmath0 is uv finite .",
    "then the exponential of the bare action is expressed in terms of @xmath0 with the inverse fourier transform : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is another normalization factor which we do not need to specify .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is the source for the deviation of the field from the vacuum value , and , consequently , there is no term linear in @xmath3 in the expansion of @xmath0 in powers of the source : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the matrix of exact propagators , and @xmath14 is the generating functional of connected green s functions with more than two external legs .",
    "with the standard functional tricks ( see @xcite ) , we rewrite the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ift ] ) as follows : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is yet another normalization factor , @xmath17 is the @xmath18-product , and @xmath19 is the generating functional of connected amplitudes with more than two external legs .",

    "this is a form of the dominicis - englert duality @xcite .",
    "we now define a projector @xmath5 acting in the linear space of functionals of the fields .",
    "let the arbitrary functional belonging to this space be @xmath24 then @xmath5 is defined as follows : @xmath25 this means that @xmath5 drops the first five terms in the expansion of @xmath26 in powers of @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider bare actions that are polynomials in the fields of the fourth power .",
    "that is @xmath4 .",
    "thus , acting on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) with @xmath5 gives the following inaction equation : @xmath27    it will be convenient to further transform this equation . to make this transformation , we notice that @xmath28 here @xmath29 and indeed @xmath30 .",
    "the meaning of this equation is that both @xmath18-product and the inverse @xmath18-product @xmath31 keep the kernel of @xmath5 intact .",
    "indeed , the kernel of @xmath5 consists of the field polynomials of the fourth power , and any polynomial of the fourth power is transformed to another polynomial of the fourth power by the action of @xmath18 and @xmath31 .",
    "( [ invariance ] ) implies that @xmath32    now , adding the last equation to eq .",
    "( [ i - eq ] ) we obtain the desired form of the inaction equation : @xmath33 this equation is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ i - eq ] ) , but it is preferable to the latter equation because in the linear approximation in @xmath21 its left hand side is just @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 of eq .",

    "( [ i - eq ] ) imposes on @xmath23 , it is useful to consider an analogous equation in a finite - dimentional case .",
