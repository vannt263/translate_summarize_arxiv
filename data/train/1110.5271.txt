    "boundary extensions of conformal maps play a key role in the solution of dirichlt problems for the domain @xmath0 .",

    "thus , sufficiently accurate approximations to a compact set allow one to plot it on a computer screen with arbitrarily high resolution .    whenever @xmath25 and @xmath26 are such that @xmath27 , let @xmath28 we call such a set a _",

    "so , let us use the term _ rational disk _ to refer to an open disk whose center is a rational point and whose radius is a rational number .",
    "we could approximate points by rational disks .",
    "however , rational rectangles have certain useful properties such that the intersection of two rational rectangles is a rational rectangle .",
    "a continuous function @xmath34 can thus be approximated by a finite set of pairs @xmath35 such that each @xmath24 is either a rational carleson rectangle or a rational disk whose center is the origin , @xmath36 , and such that @xmath37 \\subseteq v_j$ ] for each @xmath38 .",
    "rational rectangles could be used instead of carleson rectangles ; the choice is for the sake of convenience later .",
    "a key consequence of these approximation schemes is that from sufficiently good approximations to @xmath14 and @xmath39 one may compute arbitrarily good approximations to @xmath40 in a fairly direct manner .",
    "a more theoretical case for these approximation schemes is given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , let us agree to approximate a function @xmath9 by finite initial segments of @xmath17 .",
    "that is , a restriction of @xmath17 to a finite initial segment of @xmath6 .",

    "there is an algorithm that , from approximations to @xmath2 , @xmath1 , a point @xmath41 , and an approximation to a ulac function @xmath17 for @xmath1 , computes an approximation to @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm _ converges _ in that it yields arbitrarily good approximations to @xmath42 when provided with sufficiently good approximations to @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath14 , and @xmath17 .",
    "this appears to be the first general algorithm for computing boundary extensions of conformal maps .",
    "hence , the results herein evidence that it is possible to create software for computing boundary extensions of conformal maps .",
    "we note that no amount of differentiability of the domain boundaries is assumed ; all that is required is sufficient information about the local connectivity of the boundary . in @xcite ,",
    "p. hertling demonstrated the computability of the riemann mapping operator for simply connected domains .",
    "the proof is based on koebe s construction and the work of bishop and bridges @xcite , @xcite .",
    "algorithms such as those in @xcite and @xcite compute approximations to conformal maps of the unit disk onto jordan domains from approximations to the domain boundary . in @xcite , it is shown that the boundary extensions of such maps can _ not _ be computed from approximations to the boundary alone , and moreover that a ulac function for the boundary represents both the sufficient and necessary additional information required . in particular , there is a jordan domain @xmath0 whose boundary is computable but such that no conformal map of @xmath4 onto @xmath0 has a computable boundary extension .",
    "therefore , any weaker parameter than a ulac function would have to fail .    by the converse of the hahn - mazurkiewicz theorem ,",
    "when @xmath0 is a bounded and simply connected domain , @xmath1 is locally connected if and only if it is the image of a continuous map on @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "however , it follows from the results in @xcite that a ulac function for @xmath1 can not be computed from such a map .",
