    "the higgs mechanism plays a central role in gauge theories , and still remains one of the most indefinite part of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "however , we know that the sm is not considered as the ultimate theory since neither the fundamental parameters , masses and couplings , nor the symmetry pattern are predicted .",
    "these elements are merely built into the model .    on another hand ,",
    "the posibility of a gauge symmetry based on the following symmetry @xmath0 ( 3 - 3 - 1 ) @xcite is particularly interesting .",
    "the main motivations to study this kind of model are :    1",
    ".   the family number must be three .",
    "this result comes from the fact that the model is anomaly - free only if we have equal number of triplets and antitriplets , counting the @xmath1 colors , and further more requiring the sum of all fermion charges to vanish .",
    "however each generation is anomalous , the anomaly cancellation occurs for the three , or multiply of three , together and not generation by generation like in the sm .",
    "therefore triangle anomalies together with asymptotic freedom imply that the number of generations must be three and only three .",
    "this may provides a first step towards answering the flavor question ; 2 .",
    "it explains why @xmath2 is observed at the z - pole .",
    "this point come from the fact that in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite we have that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coupling constants , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , are related by @xmath7 hence , this 331 model predicts that there exists an energy scale , say @xmath8 , at which the model loses its perturbative character .",
    "the value of @xmath8 can be found through the condition @xmath9 , and according to recent calculation @xmath10 tev @xcite ; 3 .",
    "it is the simplest model that includes bileptons of both types : scalar and vectors ones .",
    "in fact , although there are several models which include doubly charged scalar fields , not many of them incorporate doubly charged vector bosons : this is a particularity of the 331 model of ref .",
    "@xcite ; 4 .",
    "the model has several sources of cp violation . in the 331 model",
    "@xcite we can implement the violation of the cp symmetry , spontaneously  @xcite or explicitly  @xcite . in models with exotic leptons",
    "it is possible to implement soft cp violation  @xcite ; 5 .",
    "the extra neutral vector boson @xmath11 conserves flavor in the leptonic but not in the quark sector .",
    "the couplings to the leptons are leptophobic because of the suppression factor @xmath12 but with some quarks there are enhancements because of the factor @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed the supersymmetric extensions of the 331 models @xcite .",
    "since it is possible to define the @xmath14-parity symmetry in both models , the phenomenology with @xmath14-parity conserved has similar features to that of the @xmath14-conserving mssm : the supersymmetric particles are pair - produced and the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "however , there are differences between this kind of models and the mssm with or without @xmath14-parity breaking .    in the case in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , there are doubly charged scalar and vector fields .",
    "hence , we have doubly charged charginos which are mixtures of the superpartners of the @xmath15-vector boson with the doubly charged scalars @xcite .",
    "this implies new interactions that are not present in the mssm , for instance : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes any doubly charged chargino .",
    "moreover , in the chargino production , besides the usual mechanism , we have additional contributions coming from the @xmath15-bilepton in the s - channel .",
    "due to this fact we have an enhancement in the cross section of production of these particles in @xmath20 collisors , such as the nlc  @xcite .    we will also have the singly charged charginos and neutralinos , as in the mssm , where there are processes like @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 denoting any slepton ; @xmath24 denotes singly charged chargino and @xmath25 denotes any sneutrino .",
    "the only difference is that in the mssm there are five neutralinos while in our model there are eight neutralinos .    in the case of model in ref .",
    "@xcite there is no double charged chargino .",
    "the mechanism of production of charginos and neutralinos are the same as in the mssm , but in the case of @xmath14-parity conservation there are fifteen neutralinos and six singly charged chargino in this model .",
    "the scalar sector of the minimal 331 model @xcite was studied on @xcite . while the scalar sector of the 331 model with right handed neutrinos is given at @xcite .",
    "recently it was presented the scalar sector of the supersymmetric 331 model with right - handed neutrinos @xcite . on this work",
    "we will analyse the scalar sector of the minimal supersymmetric 331 model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ psusy1 ] we review the minimal supersymmetric 331 model .",
    "the construction of the supersymmetric scalar potential is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sp ] , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraint ] we give the constraint equations . in [ sec : analyses ] the numerical analysis are given .",
    "finally , the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in the nonsupersymmetric 331 model  @xcite the fermionic representation content is as follows : left - handed leptons @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; left - handed quarks @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; and in the right - handed components we have @xmath31 , and the exotic quarks @xmath32 . while in the supersymmetric version of this model we have to add their supersymmetric partners @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the minimal scalar representation content is formed by three scalar triplets : @xmath40 ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and their supersymmetric partner @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "however , we have to introduce the followings extras scalars @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and their higgsinos @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    in the nonsupersymmetric 331 model to give arbitrary mass to the leptons we have to introduce one scalar antisextet @xmath52.we can avoid the introduction of the antisextet by adding a charged lepton transforming as a singlet .",
    "notwithstanding , here we will omit both the antisextet and the exotic lepton , because we have showed in @xcite that in this model the @xmath14-violating interactions give the correct masses to @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    the complete set of fields in the minimal supersymmetric 331 model ( msusy331 ) has been given in @xcite , see these articles to the complete lagrangian of the model . on this article",
