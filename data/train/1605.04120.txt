    "the population of oscillators split into two coexisting distinct , spatially separated domains : in one domain oscillators are oscillating coherently and in another domain neighboring oscillators randomly populate an oscillating state and a stable steady state .",

    "the strong current interest in chimeras may be attributed to their possible connection with several phenomena in nature , like unihemispheric sleep of dolphins and certain migratory birds @xcite , ventricular fibrillation @xcite , and power grid networks @xcite .",
    "recently , chimera patterns have been found in models from ecology @xcite , squid metamaterials @xcite , and quantum systems @xcite showing their omnipresence in the macroscopic as well as in the microscopic world .    in the studies on chimera",
    ", the coupling function always plays an important role .",
    "initially it was believed that to induce chimeras a nonlocal coupling is essential .",
    "later it has been found that global coupling @xcite and even local coupling @xcite may give rise to chimera states . in the nonlocal coupling ,",
    "one has two control parameters : coupling range and coupling strength .",
    "the former is controlled by the kernel of the nonlocal coupling function : in previous studies generally a trigonometrically or exponentially decaying function or a rectangular kernel have been used .",
    "in this paper we focus on a more general and universal coupling scheme which is motivated by many real - world systems , but has not been investigated in the context of chimeras .",
    "it is governed by a long range interaction obeying a distance - dependent power law . in the long range",
    "coupling each node in the network is connected to all other nodes with an _ effective interaction strength _ that decreases with increasing distance according to a _ power - law_. thus , the oscillators are subject to a long range interaction whose interaction strength is controlled by the _ power - law exponent _ ( denoted by @xmath0 ) .",
    "earlier the long range interaction obeying a power law has been considered in ferromagnetic spin models @xcite , biological networks @xcite , hydrodynamic interaction of active particles @xcite , coupled map lattices ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and phase oscillators @xcite in the context of _",
    "synchronization_. particularly , rogers and wille @xcite numerically showed that a one - dimensional ring of coupled nonlinear phase oscillators with frequency mismatch undergoes a phase transition from a synchronized to a completely desynchronized state as the range of interaction is decreased .",
    "the long range power - law interaction is an ubiquitous form through which natural systems interact in physical and biological sciences .",
    "take for example two fundamental physical interactions , namely the electromagnetic and gravitational interactions : both of them are long range in nature and obey an inverse square law of the force ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "these long range interactions are responsible for the organization of the universe on large scale ( like the formation of galaxies and planetary motion ) as well as on small scale ( like binding of atoms and molecules in matter ) . in the one - dimensional ising spin model with long range interaction of power - law type ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that ferromagnetism is not possible for power - law exponent less than a critical value ; similar critical power - law exponents exist in the one - dimensional spin - glass model @xcite . in the context of biology ,",
    "too , long range interaction plays an important role .",
    "long range interaction with a specific algebraic scaling that controls the connectivity among the neurons was found in the animal brain @xcite .",
    "in spatial ecology , dispersal of species between different habitat patches is common .",
    "the spatial movements of most organisms are restricted and even for long - distance migrants in large networks not all the patches are likely to be accessible from a particular patch due to dispersal mortality , e.g. , _ mites _ greatly suffer from dispersal mortality with increasing distance between patches @xcite . moreover , to estimate the density of long - distance dispersing populations it is useful to consider that a proportion of population is distributed to the other connecting patches via a continuous geometric function so that more distant populations receive less migrants ( e.g. , inverse power - law ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is observed that long - distance movements of butterflies _ euphydryas aurinia _ follow an inverse power - law @xcite .",
    "motivated by this reasoning , in this paper we show that long range interaction with distance - dependent power - law coupling can induce various chimera patterns , like amplitude chimeras and chimera death . at the same time tuning of the power - law exponent",

    "[ f : pp](a ) and [ f : pp](b ) one can observe the coexistence of several steady states and limit cycles of different amplitude ( and center of mass ) , which clearly indicates the presence of multistability in the network .    in the presence of coupling",
    ", multistability arises because the dynamical equation of each node is modified by a different coupling term depending upon the configuration of all other nodes , i.e. , now every node locally adopts one of these possible states .",
    "this is the origin of chimera states in our present network @xcite .",
    "note that the individual oscillators never become chaotic , rather , they remain periodic ( and in a few nodes they even are in a state with @xmath59 ) .",
    "thus , in the incoherent domain all the oscillators are temporally periodic but spatially chaotic @xcite .",
    "further , the occurrence of steady states with @xmath59 in the incoherent region has a broad ecological significance . since there is no dispersal among the vegetation ( v ) in different patches",
    "[ see eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ] , thus , once they become extinct in a certain patch ( or node ) they remain so .",
    "moreover , the carrying capacity ( @xmath40 ) determines the maximum population density that an ecosystem can support .",
    "hence , the maximum vegetation density that each patch can have is restricted by the value of @xmath40 . here in each patch",
    "the herbivore ( @xmath60 ) survives by consuming vegetation ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "however , in an ecological network , herbivores may move from one patch to another . in that case , as each patch has limited vegetation density ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) , in some of the patches vegetation @xmath61 is unable to survive ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) due to overexploitation by the herbivores .",
    "interestingly , we note that in the nodes where vegetation @xmath59 , herbivore @xmath63 [ see fig .  [",
    "f : pp](a ) ] : this is physically intuitive because dispersal occurs only in @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , even if @xmath61 in a certain patch becomes extinct , herbivores of that patch can harvest resources from the other patches present in the network and recolonize themselves in order to avoid local extinction .",
    "but , due to the finite coupling range ( determined by @xmath0 ) they only manage to get resources from a limited number of patches which makes their oscillation amplitude small [ see fig .  [",
    "f : pp](a ) ] . for stronger coupling strength and larger coupling range ( i.e. , smaller @xmath0 ) , dispersal through nonlocal coupling is sufficient to impose the chimera death state , i.e. , both @xmath61 and @xmath60 reach stable steady states .",

    "_ et al_. @xcite that a network of sl oscillators under nonlocal coupling exhibits amplitude chimera , in - phase synchronized states , and chimera death with proper choices of _ coupling range _ ( @xmath13 ) and _ coupling strength _ ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "here we show that under the distance - dependent power - law coupling we can induce those states by choosing suitable values of @xmath0 and @xmath12 while keeping @xmath13 fixed .",
    "we consider @xmath89 identical sl oscillators with @xmath80 . as",
    "before we take @xmath90 , i.e. , here @xmath91 .",
    "we integrate eq .",
    "( [ sl ] ) using the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm ( step size=0.01 ) .",
    "spatiotemporal dynamics of the network for different @xmath0 with @xmath79 are shown in fig .",
    "[ a : fig1 ] ( a - c ) , and the corresponding snapshots are shown in fig .",
    "[ a : fig1](d - f ) . for @xmath81",
    "we observe amplitude chimeras [ spatiotemporal plot in fig .",
    "[ a : fig1](a ) and snapshot in fig .",
    "[ a : fig1](d ) ] ; here , the incoherent domain shows a spatially random variation in amplitude ( for a detailed discussion on the properties of amplitude chimeras in sl oscillators , like their transient nature , finite size effect , effect of noise , etc .",
    "see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that all the oscillators have the same phase velocity but in the incoherent domain they have disparate amplitude and center of mass .",
    "this can be seen from the phase portrait shown in fig .",
    "[ a : fig1](g ) . a decrease in @xmath0 results in an in - phase synchronized state , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ a : fig1](b ) [ spatiotemporal plot ] and fig .",
    "[ a : fig1](e ) [ snapshot ] for @xmath1 .",
    "the chimera death pattern is observed at a relatively low @xmath0 , i.e. , in the limit of near - global coupling .",
    "figure  [ a : fig1](c ) shows the spatiotemporal dynamics of the chimera death pattern for @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding snapshot and phase portrait are shown in fig .",
    "[ a : fig1](f ) and [ a : fig1](h ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , we conclude that as we decrease @xmath0 from a higher value , we observe a transition from amplitude chimera to chimera death via an in - phase synchronized state .",
