    "in this paper we present multiwavelength observations of the galactic globular cluster m2 ( ngc  7089 ) .",
    "these observations are part of a large project aimed at characterizing the ultraviolet ( uv ) bright populations of old stellar systems and determining the impact of stellar dynamics on the cluster evolution by studying their `` exotic '' populations . as in our previous study of ngc  1904 ( lanzoni et al .",
    "2007b ) , we use hst high - resolution uv and optical data for the high density central region of the cluster and a combination of ground - based wide - field optical data ( megacam - cfht and emmi - ntt ) and uv data from the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) for the cluster outskirts . combining these samples",
    "allows an accurate determination of the center of gravity , the stellar density profile and the structural parameters . in this paper",
    "we focus on the blue straggler star ( bss ) population as tracers of the dynamical state of the host cluster and products of the interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics .",
    "we also discuss possible radial gradients in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and other stellar populations .",
    "we defer a discussion of the horizontal branch ( hb ) population to a future paper .    in the optical color - magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    "bsss are bluer ( hotter ) and brighter than the main - sequence ( ms ) stars , thus mimicking a stellar population significantly younger than the `` normal '' cluster stars .",
    "as shown by shara et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , bsss are more massive than normal stars , suggesting that some mass - increasing mechanism drives their formation .",
    "possible explanations involve mass transfer between binary companions , the merger of a binary system , and the collision between single and/or binary stars ( mccrea 1964 ; zinn & searle 1976 ) .",
    "clear differentiation among these possibilities is difficult , since primordial binaries can sink to the cluster center , where stellar collisions may significantly alter their evolution .",
    "similarly , gravitational interactions can generate new binary systems and possibly kick them out of the cluster core . with this caveat ,",
    "we define primordial binary bss ( pb - bss ) those formed by mass transfer processes ( possibly up to complete coalescence ) in primordial binaries which evolved in isolation in the cluster .",
    "collisional bss ( col - bss ) are those generated by mechanisms where stellar collisions played a major role .",
    "we therefore expect pb - bss to mainly populate the external regions of the cluster , where the collision probabilities are lower .",
    "col - bsss preferentially form in the central regions because of the higher stellar densities .",
    "these formation mechanisms may work simultaneously with different efficiency depending on the environment ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1993 ; ferraro et al . 1999 , 2003 ;",
    "bellazzini et al 2002 ) .    observed bss radial distributions have been particularly important in demonstrating the complex interplay of the various phenomena .",
    "typically the bss radial distributions have been found to be bimodal ( peaked in the clusters center and outskirts and with a dip at intermediate radii ; see references in dalessandro et al .",
    "2008a ; see also beccari et al .",
    "2008 for m53 ) .",
    "only two clusters deviate from this pattern : @xmath2  centauri ( @xmath2  cen , ferraro et al .",
    "2006b ) and ngc  2419 ( dalessandro et al .",
    "2008b ) . in those clusters",
    "the bss radial distribution is indistinguishable from that of the other cluster stars .",
    "simple dynamical simulations ( mapelli et al . 2004 , 2006 ; lanzoni et al .",
    "2007a ) suggest that the observed bimodality can be modelled assuming that pb - bsss and col - bsss co - exist in the same cluster with relative fractions that vary from one case to another .",
    "the radial distributions observed in ngc  2419 and @xmath2cen could be the observational evidence that mass - segregation processes have played a minor role in altering the bss radial distributions and that the observed bss population is mainly composed of pb - bsss .",
    "the present work is based on a combination of different high - resolution and wide - field data - sets .",
    "the high resolution set consists of a series of wfpc2 and acs images taken at various wavelengths ranging from the uv to the optical bands . the wfpc2 images ( prop 8709 , p.i .",
    "ferraro ) were obtained through the uv filters @xmath3 and @xmath4 with total exposure times @xmath5s and @xmath6s respectively , and through the optical filters @xmath7 and @xmath8 with exposure times @xmath5s and @xmath9s .",
    "the center of the cluster is located in the wf2 chip ( pixel scale @xmath10 ) .",
    "the photometric reduction of these data was performed using romafot ( buonanno et al .",
    "1983 ) a package developed to obtain accurate photometry in crowded regions and specifically optimized to handle under - sampled point spread functions ( buonanno & iannicola 1989 ) . the acs data - set is a series of images in @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) with @xmath15s and @xmath16s ( prop . 10775 , p.i .",

    "the reduction of    galex data was performed independently for each filter with    daophotii / allframe ( stetson 1987 ) .",

    "( 2001 , 2003 ) and a specific cross - correlation tool .",
    "all the stars in common with the galex , emmi and hst samples were then used as secondary astrometric standards in order to put all the catalogs in the same astrometric system .",
    "several hundred astrometric standards have been found in each step , allowing a very precise astrometry for each catalog . at the end of the procedure",
    "the estimated error in the absolute positions , both in right ascension ( @xmath38 ) and declination ( @xmath39 ) is about @xmath40    all the wfpc2 magnitudes ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) were calibrated in the stmag system using the equations and zeropoints listed in holtzmann et al .",

    "the galex instrumental @xmath33 and @xmath34 magnitudes were calibrated to stmag system using the stars in common with the wfpc2 .",
    "the center of gravity has been obtained following the procedure adopted in our previous work ( see for example lanzoni et al .",
    "a first estimate of the cluster center was performed by eye on the wf2 chip of the wfpc2 image , then the exact measure of @xmath45 was obtained by means of an iterative procedure that averages the absolute positions of stars lying within @xmath46 from the first guess center . in order to avoid biases and spurious effects , we considered two samples with two different limiting magnitudes ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath49 obtained with the two samples agree within @xmath50 .",
    "we adopt the mean value as the best estimate of @xmath49 : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this new determination is substantially different from the center reported by harris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) on the basis of the surface brightness profile and using photographic plates : our @xmath45 is located at @xmath53 west ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) from harris center .",
    "once all the data - sets have been photometrically homogenized and put in the same reference frame , and the cluster center has been determined , we have built a single catalog by combining the following sub - samples : _",

    "of course only a fraction of these stars also has galex magnitudes ) .",
    "the criteria used for these definitions have been chosen to sample the highly crowded central regions of the cluster with the highest spatial resolution and uv band data ( thus to maximally limit the effects of photometric errors and stellar blends ) , while covering the entire cluster extension by means of wide - field images .",
    "the maps of the adopted samples are shown in figures 1 and 2 . in fig .  3 the ( @xmath58 ) cmd of the wfpc2 sample is shown .",
    "we have determined the projected density profile of m2 by measuring the star counts over the entire cluster extension . only stars with @xmath59 in the combined sample , covering the cluster extension from @xmath45 to @xmath60 were considered ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the area was divided in 36 annuli all centered on @xmath45 .",
    "each annulus was divided into an adequate number of sub - sectors in which the stellar density has been calculated as the ratio between the number of stars and the sub - sector area . for each annulus",
    "the resulting density is given by the average of the corresponding sub - sector densities and the error is quoted as the square root of the variance of the sub - sector densities . in this procedure",
    "we have also taken into account the incomplete area coverage of the most external annuli and the largest ccd gap in the megacam fov .",
    "the observed density profile is plotted in fig .",
    "the sample nicely covers the entire cluster extension .",
    "the four outermost annuli ( with @xmath61 ) show a flattening of star counts giving a direct estimate of the stellar background in the cluster direction : for @xmath59 the background star density is @xmath62  stars / arcmin@xmath32 .",
    "the observed profile is well reproduced by an isotropic single - mass king model with concentration @xmath63 and core radius @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding tidal radius is @xmath65 . since there is an uncertainty of about 15@xmath66 in the determination of @xmath67 , in our analysis below we will consider all stars lying within @xmath68 .",
    "the newly determined cluster parameters are substantially different from those reported by harris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the luminosity center and the surface brightness distribution ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and from the even higher concentration model found by pryor & meylan ( 1993 ; @xmath71 and @xmath70 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "6 ( dashed line ) , a king model with the parameters quoted by harris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) does not reproduce the observed profile . on the contrary , a reasonable agreement ( within the errors )",
    "is found with the values estimated by mclaughlin & van der marel ( 2005 ; @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) . assuming a distance modulus @xmath74 and a reddening @xmath75 ( harris et al .",
    "1996 ) we find a real distance @xmath76kpc , and a core radius @xmath77pc .",
    "the best - fit model reproduces the observed profile out to @xmath78 very well , while at larger distances the observed star counts show an excess with respect to the model . while this discrepancy is not statistically significant , it deserves further investigation since it could be the signature of tidal distortion in the outer regions ( see leon et al .",
    "2000 for more details )",
    ". another interesting feature of density profile is that the innermost point seems to deviate from the canonical flat - core king model .",
    "this is also worthy of future investigation since similar features might be related to the presence of an intermediate mass - black hole ( e.g. miocchi 2007 , lanzoni et al .",
    "in this section we describe the procedure that we have followed to select the bss population and to construct the bss radial distribution in m2 . at the uv wavelengths , hot populations like bsss and extreme - hb stars are the brightest objects , while cool populations ( like red giant branch  rgb  stars ) appear quite faint ( see figs . 7 and 10 ) . because of this , we always prefer to use the uv - cmd as the reference plane for the bss selection . moreover , since the hst spatial resolution dramatically reduces problems connected with crowding and blends , we have primarily selected the bss population by considering the wfpc2 sample in the ( @xmath42 , @xmath79 ) plane . in order to avoid contamination from the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) stars , we selected only stars with @xmath80 , that is about 1 magnitude brighter than the turn - off ( to ) point ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the number of bss thus selected in the wfpc2 sample is 82 .    as in previous studies",

    "the total number of bss found in the acs sample is 20 . in the emmi catalog the bss",
    "have been selected in the ( @xmath18 , @xmath85 ) cmd , using the same cut in the @xmath18 filter as for acs sample .",
    "considering the quality of the diagram the color limit was set to @xmath86 to avoid spurious detections and blends from to and sgb stars : 9 bss have been selected in this way ( see fig .",
    "9 ) . in the most external region sampled by our observations ( @xmath87 ) the combination of the megacam and the galex samples",
    "allows the construction of an uv cmd .",
    "since both the galex @xmath34 and the hst @xmath42 magnitudes have been calibrated on the stmag photometric system ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) , we have used the same threshold ( @xmath88 ) adopted for the wfpc2 sample to define the selection box in the ( @xmath34 , @xmath89 ) plane . the result is shown in fig .",

    "2008a ) we also need to select a reference population which is representative of the `` normal '' cluster population . as in other works of this series , we have used the hb and rgb stars as reference populations .",
    "the selection of the rgb stars has been performed in the optical planes .",
    "for all of the samples a magnitude cut at @xmath92 has been adopted .",
    "however for our analysis only stars with @xmath93 were used in order to avoid saturated stars in the acs and megacam / galex sample ( fig .  8 and fig .",
    "the color limits of the selection boxes have been chosen to follow the rgb ridge mean line in each cmd while avoiding regions with high probability of field star contamination ( the selected rgb stars are marked with empty squares in fig .  8 , 9 and 10 )",

    "the magnitude range of the rgb reference population is the same as that adopted for the  faint  rgb discussed below .    in the wfpc2 and megacam / galex samples",
    "the hb stars have been selected on the basis of their positions in the ( @xmath42 , @xmath94 ) and ( nuv , nuv - v ) cmds respectively ( see left panel of fig .  10 for the wide - field sample ) .",
    "the positions in the optical megacam / galex plane of the selected hb stars ( fig .",
    "10 right panel ) have been used to define the selection box for the acs and emmi samples ( see figs .  8 and 9 ) . by cross - correlating our catalog with the catalogs of rr  lyrae stars found by lee & carney ( 1999 ) and lazaro et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we have identified all of the 42 known variables ( they are marked as asterisks in fig .  7 , 8 , 9 and 10 ) and",
    "we have included them in our hb sample .",
    "the total number of hb stars within @xmath68 is 875 ( 525 in wfpc2 , 184 in acs , 104 in emmi and 62 in megacam / galex samples ) .",
    "having defined the reference populations we can now examine the bss radial distribution . the bss cumulative radial distribution is shown in fig .  11 with the distributions of the hb and rgb stars shown for comparison .",
    "the bss population is more segregated in the central regions and less concentrated in the outer parts than either the hb and the rgb stars .",
    "the ks test gives a probability of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 significance level ) that the radial distribution of the bss is extracted from the same parent distribution of the reference population .    for a more quantitative analysis we computed the population ratios @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 is the number of stars belonging to a given population ) in 6 concentric annuli centered on @xmath45 .",
    "to do this we had to evaluate the impact of field star contamination on each population .",
    "the field stars predominantly lie in a vertical sequence at @xmath100 and dramatically affect the rgb population ( see fig  5 right panel ) .",
    "an estimate of the field star contamination can be directly obtained from our sample by considering an annulus at @xmath101 ( @xmath102 of which is sampled by the megacam data ) far beyond the tidal radius of the cluster ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we counted the number of field stars in this annulus lying within the bss , hb and rgb selection boxes shown in figs .",
    "8 , 9 , and 10 , and we derived the following values for their density : @xmath104  stars / arcmin@xmath32 , @xmath105  stars / arcmin@xmath32 , while no field stars have been found within the hb selection box .",
    "these values have been used to statistically decontaminate the star counts in each annulus .",
    "the star counts for each annulus are listed in table  2 .",

    "12 ) shows a flat distribution across the cluster extension , as expected for `` normal '' populations . as a further confirmation of the bss bimodality",
    ", we also computed the double normalized ratio as defined in ferraro et al .",
    "( 1993 ) :    @xmath109    where pop = bss , hb . the total sampled luminosity ( @xmath110 ) , as well as",
    "the luminosity sampled in each annulus ( @xmath111 ) , has been estimated from the king model by using the cluster structural parameters , distance modulus and reddening quoted in section 3.3 , and the central surface brightness reported by harris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . the incomplete spatial coverage due to the largest ( @xmath112 ) gap between the megacam ccds has been taken into account . as shown in fig .  13",
    ", @xmath113 is constant with a value close to 1 out to @xmath114 .",
    "this is just as expected : the fraction of hb ( as any post - ms ) stars is proportional to the fraction of sampled light , as shown in renzini & fusi pecci ( 1988 ) .",
    "conversely the radial distribution of the bss double normalized ratio ( @xmath115 ) confirms the bimodal behaviour : it is peaked in the central regions , decreases to a minimum value at about @xmath116 and then rises again in the cluster outskirts .",
    "the location of this minimum at @xmath117 can be related to the dynamical evolution of the cluster and in particular to the radius of avoidance ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "this parameter is defined as the radius within which all the stars as massive as @xmath119 ( the assumed mass for bsss ) have already sunk to the center because of mass segregation ( mapelli et al . 2004 , 2006 ) . using the dynamical friction time - scale formula ( e.g. mapelli et al .",
    "2006 ) under the assumption of a cluster age @xmath120gyr , a central velocity dispersion of @xmath121 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) , we obtained @xmath122 .",

    "beccari et al .",
    "( 2006a ) found a significant overabundance of agb stars in the very central regions of 47  tuc .",
    "this excess could be due to contamination of genuine agbs by massive ( 1.1@xmath123 ) objects in late evolutionary stages ( e.g. in the horizontal branch phase , as suggested by sills et al .",
    "presumably these objects arise from binary systems ( mainly bsss ) segregated in the cluster core because of dynamical effects . to search for a similar result in m2",
    ", we used the wfpc2 and the emmi sample where the brightest evolutionary sequences are well defined up to the rgb tip at @xmath124 .",
    "we selected agb stars in the ( @xmath18 , @xmath125 ) plane for the wfpc2 sample and in the ( @xmath18 , @xmath85 ) for the emmi sample as shown in fig .",
    "it was not possible to use either the acs or the megacam / galex samples because of saturation problems .    to study the radial distribution we divided the covered region into 5 concentric annuli centered on @xmath45 and counted the number of agbs and hbs lying in each annulus .",
    "it was not possible to do a statistical decontamination of the agb population because the megacam / galex sample saturates at @xmath126 .",
    "however , we would expect that in the central regions it does not appreciably affect the observed radial distribution .",
    "15 upper panel shows the behaviour of the population ratios @xmath127 as a function of the distance from the cluster center . as apparent from the figure , while the mean value of the 4 outermost annuli is @xmath128 , fully consistent with the value expected from the evolutionary timescales ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) , the ratio turns out to be higher ( @xmath129 ) in the outermost annulus ( corresponding to @xmath130 ) .",
    "this central overconcentration of the agb population corresponds to an excess of about @xmath131 ( or 9 - 10 more stars ) in the first annulus .",
    "this value is compatible with the life - times and populations ratios computed by sills et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for evolved collisional products , supporting the idea of a possible contamination by evolved bss .",
    "to further investigate this feature we also computed the double normalized ratio .",
    "the incomplete spatial coverage has been taken into account .",
    "the radial distribution of @xmath132 ( see fig . 15 bottom panel ) fully confirms this behaviour , showing a central peak ( @xmath133 ) within @xmath130 , while in the outer part the ratio remains constant at @xmath134 fully in agreement with @xmath113 .",
    "purely on the basis of small number statistics introduced by binning , the agb central peak is marginally significant ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "however the significance of the peak can also be evaluated with a ks test on the cumulative distribution , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ agb - dist ] .",
    "the probability that the agbs are drawn from a different distribution from the hbs is 93% ( @xmath136 ) . the bss distribution is also shown in fig .",
    "[ agb - dist ] . while agbs are more concentrated than hbs , they are less concentrated than bsss , with a 98% probability that they are extracted from a different parent family .",
    "in this respect they are different from the agbs in 47  tuc where agbs and bsss have similar radial distributions .",
    "sohn et al . ( 1996 ) , hereafter s96 , found that m2 has a radial color gradient , in the sense that the central regions are bluer than the outer parts , with a variation of about @xmath137 . to investigate this interesting feature we computed the ( @xmath125 ) integrated color within @xmath138 from @xmath45 which approximately corresponds to the region used by s96 .",
    "we divided the wfpc2 sample in 5 concentric annuli ( the first corresponding to @xmath130 ) , and computed the color of each annulus from the resolved stars by considering three different magnitude cuts : @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "17 ( upper panel ) we found that when only the brightest stars are included ( @xmath139 , black and open dots in fig .",
    "17 ) a color difference @xmath142 between the center ( bluer ) and the outer annuli is apparent .",
    "even if this is a less than @xmath143 result , it is consistent with the finding of s96 . when also fainter stars are included ( i.e. for @xmath141 ) , the color gradient decreases , and if the brightest stars are excluded ( @xmath140 ) it completely disappears and ( @xmath125 ) remains constant all over the considered radial range .",
    "to further investigate this behaviour we made the same computation for the acs sample using the ( @xmath82 ) color .",
    "in this sample saturation occurs at about @xmath144 , so the test is limited to the population with @xmath145 .",
    "no color gradient is visible in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "our results therefore indicate that the observed color gradient is due to the brightest stars and not to an over - concentration of bsss or blue faint objects .",
    "this seems in disagreement with the conclusion of s96 , who found the color gradient only when using resolved stars with @xmath139 .",
    "however , as already discussed by these authors , the poor seeing conditions and the spatial resolution of the instrument ( 0.56@xmath146 ) used in their analysis did not allow them to sample all the populations with acceptable photometric accuracy .",
    "to more deeply understand the origin of the detected color gradient , we further investigated the properties of the brightest populations in the very central regions of m2 . since the agb is 0.2 - 0.3 mag bluer than the rgb in ( @xmath125 ) , we first investigated whether the agb central excess ( sect.5.2 ) could account for the observed color gradient .",
    "we therefore artificially cancelled the agb central peak , by randomly excluding 10 stars from the innermost bin , and re - computed the central color : this still yields a center bluer than the exterior .",
    "very bright rgb stars therefore remain the only candidates . in order to test this hypothesis",
    "we compared the radial distribution of the brightest portion of the rgb ( @xmath139 ) in the wfpc2 sample ( see fig .",
    "14 , left panel ) to the faint ( @xmath147 ) one .",
    "the radial distributions of these populations clearly show that the brightest giants are less concentrated than the faintest ones , with a @xmath148 probability ( about @xmath149 ) that they are extracted from a different parent family ( see fig .",
    "16 and the upper panel of fig .",
    "we have therefore re - computed the central color after having artificially increased the number of bright rgbs in the innermost bin , thus to flatten the radial distribution of the bright - to - faint rgb ratio ( to this purpose , we have randomly extracted 25 bright rgbs from the observed luminosity function ) .",
    "this completely removes the color gradient ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "hence we conclude the the color gradient found by s96 and confirmed here is due to a deficit of bright rgb stars in the center rather than a surplus of fainter blue stars .",
    "the bss population of m2 can be characterized as what is emerging as _  normal  _ : a bimodal radial distribution with a minimum in the zone of avoidance , and with a value of the central bss specific frequency ( @xmath97 ) which is also typical .",
    "bimodal distributions are a very common feature of the galactic gc bss populations ( dalessandro et al .",
    "only two clusters , ngc  2419 and @xmath2cen , deviate significantly from this pattern .",
    "both of these systems are very large .",
    "there is even some doubt that @xmath2cen is a true gc ( bekki & freeman 2003 ) . of the bimodal clusters only two , ngc  6388 ( dalessandro et al . 2008a ) and ngc  5024 ( beccari et al .",
    "2008 ) , have minima in their bss radial distributions which differ significantly from @xmath150 .",
    "presumably this arises because of a lower efficiency of the dynamical friction in these two clusters , for reasons yet to be explained .    as beccari et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found for 47  tuc , we find an excess of agb stars in the center of m2 . because of the smallish sample size",
    ", the excess is only marginally significant , and unlike in 47  tuc , the agb population is not as concentrated as the bss one .    in agreement with s96",
    "we find that the integrated color of the central region of m2 is bluer that the exterior .",
    "we show that this color gradient is due to a deficit of bright rgb stars , and not to an excess of faint blue objects , such as bss or hb stars .",
    "a similar deficit of bright rgb stars has also been found in the very massive gc ngc  2808 ( sandquist et al .",
    "they do not explore the radial dependence of their result , and neither of the two mechanisms they discuss for producing a deficit ( neutrino losses and extra mass loss ) would have an obvious radial dependence .",
    "we view our agb surplus and bright rgb deficit as suggestive  given the short lifetime in these phases it is impossible to do better than @xmath1 in m2 or any single cluster .",
    "if similar results are found in other clusters , there would be interesting consequences for stellar evolution theory and stellar population studies . given this , it would be highly desirable that future photometric studies of gcs were designed in such a way that unsaturated photometry of the brightest stars was possible .",
