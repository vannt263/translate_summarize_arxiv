    "let us denote by @xmath4 the linear system of plane curves of degree @xmath2 with @xmath5 general points of multiplicity at least @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "this linear system has been under study for more than a century , and in general the computation of its dimension , which is the basic problem in multivariate hermite interpolation , is still an open problem .    for nine or fewer points the dimension",
    "is known , which is a classical result going back to castelnuovo @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "there is a set of related conjectures about this dimension due to segre , harbourne , gimigliano and hirschowitz ( see  [ sec : ghh ] ) and nagata ( see @xcite ) , which we will review in the next section .",
    "however , even in the _ homogeneous _ case with ten points , i.e. for the linear system @xmath8 , the dimension is not known ; it is expected to be @xmath9 and the conjectures , in this case , assert that the dimension is as expected . in this paper",
    "we prove the following result which supports the above conjectures .",
    "[ thm : main ] for every pair of integers @xmath0 with @xmath10 , the linear system @xmath8 has the expected dimension .",
    "our proof relies on a fairly complete understanding of linear systems on surfaces supporting an anticanonical curve ; in  [ sec : ghh ] we review the results we need , whereas we devote  [ sec : nagata ] to the connection between the conjecture of segre , harbourne , gimigliano and hirschowitz and the one of nagata .",
    "we note that the problem of computing the dimension of these linear systems may be formulated on the blow  up of the plane at the multiple points ; if @xmath11 is the blow  up of the point @xmath12 , then the system @xmath13 of plane curves corresponds to @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the blow  up of the plane , and @xmath16 is the pullback of the line class . in terms of the cohomology of this sheaf , the system is non  empty if @xmath17 , and has the _ expected dimension _ if @xmath18 : we say in this case that the system is _ non ",
    "special_.    in  [ sec : firstdeg ] we present a degeneration of the blown  up plane which we will use to begin the analysis of the @xmath19 .",
    "this degeneration has been introduced in @xcite and @xcite for similar purposes , and we will review it briefly .",
    "sections [ sec : throw ] , [ sec : computation ] and [ sect : gentrasv ] introduce technical tools that are used in the remaining sections , in which we discuss refinements of the degeneration , necessary to prove the theorem under various hypotheses for the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "the proof eventually consists in showing non  speciality in certain limit situations .",
    "the degenerations that we introduce can be considered to be inspired by the minimal model program in birational geometry ; we perform explicit modifications ( to the central fiber of our degeneration ) in order to make the limit bundle more nef .",
    "the basic technique can in principle be applied even beyond the bound @xmath21 .",
    "this would require however the understanding of more and more complicated degenerations , which , at the moment , seem difficult to handle .",
    "a corollary of our theorem is that the linear system @xmath22 is empty , which itself has been an open problem for about twenty years (  le cas inviol \" according to a. hirschowitz @xcite ) . in conclusion",
    ", we would like to stress that , more than this specific result , it is the success of the technique we introduce here which provides the strongest evidence to date for the truth of the conjecture , since , as we said , there seems to be no theoretical obstruction to carrying it further , but only computational complications .",

    "this cuts out a complete linear series on the cubic @xmath827 since the kernel linear system has dimension zero .",
    "hence again the transversality holds and we conclude that @xmath835 by .",
    "there is no matching possible between this @xmath587dimensional linear system of degree @xmath398 on @xmath51 , and the dimension @xmath267 linear system restricted from the @xmath456 side , by generality of the construction .",
    "the curve @xmath51 is a nodal rational curve , and we may embed its normalization into @xmath837 as a rational normal curve of degree @xmath398 ; we have the complete @xmath838 on it which is cut out by the hyperplanes in @xmath839 .",
    "let @xmath540 and @xmath541 be the two points on the curve that are identified to form the nodal curve @xmath51 . consider the chordal line passing through the two points .",
    "each point on this line gives rise to a complete @xmath840 which identifies the two points .",
    "the line minus the two points may be identified with the natural @xmath841 component of the picard group of @xmath51 .",
    "the two sublinear systems that we have correspond to a line and a plane meeting the chord , giving rise to a @xmath842 and @xmath843 identifying the points .",
    "the usual generality and transversality arguments as in ",
    "[ sect : gentrasv ] , imply that the above line and plane are general under the condition of meeting the chord . hence there is no hyperplane containing these both , and",
    "so there is no common restriction .            * the linear system on @xmath466 cremona reduces to @xmath846 , where the base points lie , as above , on @xmath581 , which has dimension 12 ; * the linear system on @xmath450 cremona reduces to @xmath847 , which has dimension 11 ; * the linear system on @xmath451 is composed with 8 conics plus a fixed line .",
    "all systems are non  empty and non  special , the transversality criteria all hold . indeed , from part ( ii ) of lemma [ lem : v4f ]",
    ", we see that the system of curves on @xmath611 cuts out a complete linear series on the double curve @xmath51 .",
    "moreover one directly verifies that @xmath470 cuts out complete linear series on the curves @xmath848 , for @xmath396 .",
    "therefore the dimension of the system on @xmath456 is 6 .",
    "similarly the dimension of the system on @xmath849 is 2 and moreover its restriction of the latter system to @xmath51 is injective .",
    "the restriction of the @xmath456 system to @xmath51 has dimension 3 . using the same analysis as in the previous case",
    ", we see that these two series on @xmath51 intersect in a linear series of dimension 1 , and this implies that the family of matching curves on the central fibre has dimension 4 .",
    "consider the fourth degeneration : this is necessary since the quartics split with multiplicity 2 from the bundle on @xmath456 in the third degeneration .",
    "then we have the following bundles ( see  [ sec:4 ] ) :    * @xmath854 , which is cremona equivalent to @xmath855^ 8)$ ] and the eight compound simple points lie four each on the two conics @xmath557 ; * @xmath856 which is cremona equivalent to @xmath857^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this is in turn cremona equivalent to a system of the form @xmath858 , where the six points of multiplicity @xmath816 are general , whereas the four points of multiplicity @xmath859 are not ; three of them are on the same line @xmath559 and two of these are infinitely near giving a compound @xmath860 $ ] point ; the line @xmath559 is the image of one of the curves @xmath245 , the other curve @xmath861 is contracted to the compound @xmath860 $ ] point ; * @xmath862 is cremona equivalent to @xmath863 ^ 2)$ ] ; * @xmath864 and @xmath865 fare trivial , for @xmath396 and @xmath866 .",
    "we fix @xmath867 .",
    "then @xmath868^ 8))=49 $ ] . in order to compute the dimension of @xmath869",
    ", we have to take into account the matching conditions with the self double curves .",
    "the usual transversality arguments tell us that this imposes at least 16 conditions , i.e. , 12 for the matching on @xmath248 and @xmath249 and 4 for the matching on the curves @xmath870 , @xmath578 ( see  [ sec:4 ] ) . hence we find @xmath871 . in addition , from part ( ii ) of lemma [ lem : v4f ] , we see that the system of matching curves on @xmath611 cuts out a complete linear series on the double curve @xmath51 .",
    "the system @xmath856 is cremona equivalent to @xmath872 .",
    "the base points are not general , but the above description implies that the system is non  special , of dimension 15 . the usual transversality gives us 14 more matching conditions along the curves @xmath546 , on each of which @xmath856 cuts out a complete linear series .",
    "hence the system on @xmath873 has dimension 1 .",
    "we claim that the dimension of the system of matching curves on @xmath874 is 24 .",
    "indeed such a curve can be constructed as follows : take any curve @xmath875 on @xmath856 , which depends on one parameter , and add any curve @xmath876 on @xmath615 such that @xmath875 and @xmath876 cut out the same divisor on @xmath51 . since @xmath51 is a rational curve of arithmetic genus 1 , @xmath877 , and the matching curves on @xmath611 cut out a complete linear series on @xmath51 , we see that @xmath876 varies with at most @xmath878 parameters .",
    "this proves our claim .    finally , adding the remaining surfaces @xmath879 for @xmath396 and @xmath866 does not increase the number of parameters of matching curves",
