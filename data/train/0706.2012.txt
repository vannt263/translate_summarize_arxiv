    "this instability , however , is _ very _ weak .",
    "the corresponding ordering momentum is extremely small , @xmath264 @xcite , translating into similarly tiny `` instability energy '' @xmath265 .",
    "moreover , this classical instability is overshadowed by a stronger quantum ( of collinear type ) ones , of the order @xmath21 @xcite . since our approximation",
    "is concerned with the features of the dynamical structure factor at energies of order @xmath20 and higher , we are allowed to disregard these weak instabilities .    _ anti - bound states _ are analyzed similarly .",
    "in this case , @xmath266 is above the 2-spinon continuum where @xmath267 , see .",
    "since @xmath268 continuously decreases in magnitude to zero but retains the same ( negative ) sign as @xmath13 in increased from @xmath269 to @xmath270 , the condition for the existence of an anti - bound state is simply @xmath271 .",
    "the anti - bound state therefore merges into the two - spinon continuum when @xmath272 . as @xmath64 is increased above this threshold",
    ", one can show that , because @xmath273 for @xmath274 @xcite , the anti - bound state energy scales as @xmath275 while its spectral weight scales as @xmath276 , similarly to the bound state situation discussed above .",

    "hence , @xmath279 and the triplon lineshape is in fact lorentian , see . however , the 4-spinon spectral weight is very small in the region between @xmath280 and @xmath281 boundaries @xcite , and we find that anti - bound states remain well defined , with the height - to - width ratio well above @xmath282 .",
    "being a collective excitation above the two - particle continuum , the anti - bound triplon here is very similar to the familiar zero - sound mode in a fermi - liquid , e.g. @xmath283he .",
    "the analogy is made much more precise by focusing on the region near @xmath284 point in the brillouin zone , where the 2-spinon continuum collapses onto a line : @xmath285 as @xmath286 . in this region",

    "<S> the search for elementary excitations with fractional quantum numbers is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility in a realistic model for several materials , the spin-1/2 spatially anisotropic frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions . by restricting the hilbert space to that expressed by exact eigenstates of the heisenberg chain </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an effective schrdinger equation valid in the weak interchain - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical spin correlations from this approach agree quantitatively with inelastic neutron measurements on the triangular antiferromagnet cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral features in such antiferromagnets can be attributed to two types of excitations : descendents of one - dimensional spinons of individual chains , and coherently propagating `` triplon '' bound states of spinon pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that triplons are generic features of spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets , and arise because the bound spinon pair lowers its kinetic energy by propagating between chains .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most dramatic effects of strong interactions in electronic materials is the emergence of particles with fractional quantum numbers , for example charge @xmath2 laughlin quasiparticles in the fractional quantum hall efect , and spin - charge separated excitations in one dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wires and carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , fractionalization is known to be quite generic in 1d conductors and magnets.@xcite in this case the spin excitation carrying a fractional quantum number , spin @xmath3 , is referred to as a spinon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in dimensions higher than one , the elementary excitation from a magnetically ordered states is known as a magnon and carries spin 1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , fractionalization caused by strong quantum fluctuations has been repeatedly identified theoretically as a possible phenomena underlying unusual experimental behavior of strongly correlated materials in two and three dimensions and zero magnetic field , such as high - temperature superconductors , heavy fermions , and frustrated quantum magnets . in these contexts , resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theories @xcite and slave - particle approaches @xcite have been developed to describe fractionalization in dimensions greater than one@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these approaches remain largely unproved . </S>",
    "<S> considerable effort has been devoted to the search for such exotic behaviors for decades @xcite , and only recently , experimental indications of fractionalized particles @xcite and disordered ground states @xcite have been observed in highly frustrated antiferromagnets in two dimensions ( 2d ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider how spinons may appear in a 2d magnet as descendents of their 1d counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> our focus is the spin-1/2 spatially anisotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg model defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath6 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath7 denotes the intrachain coupling , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are interchain couplings as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice ] . </S>",
    "<S> we take all the coupling constants positive , reflecting antiferromagnetic interactions , focusing on the frustrated situation @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper is a systematic method to calculate the _ inelastic _ </S>",
    "<S> magnetic structure factor @xmath12 _ for the full range of energy transfers _ with @xmath13 varying from essentially zero to large scales of several times @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is valid provided only @xmath14 is not too large , and indeed reveals characteristic features of spinon excitations .    one strong motivation to study this model comes from experiments on the material cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 , a spin-@xmath3 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a spatially anisotropic triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to eq . with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the _ measured _ </S>",
    "<S> anisotropy is @xmath17.@xcite the spectral weight in the dynamical structure factor , @xmath12 , measured in this compound is dominated by a broad continuum , extending up to energy above @xmath18 , with the usually strong magnon peak appearing uncharacteristically insignificant . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral tail for some directions in momentum space is well - fitted by a power - law form@xcite . following this observation </S>",
    "<S> , numerous theories have attributed the behavior to fractionalized excitations of exotic _ two dimensional _ critical and/or spin liquid states.@xcite other works have compared the data to anharmonic spin wave theory . though the latter calculations reproduce the _ shape _ of the observed dispersion of the ( broad ) peaks in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 , a substantial phenomenological renormalization of the exchange parameters must be included _ by hand _ to achieve quantitative agreement.@xcite however , numerical series expansion calculations using the un - renormalized measured @xmath19 values properly reproduce the experimental peak dispersion.@xcite    in this paper , we argue that the spectra in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 indeed reflect the presence of spinon excitations as originally suggested , but that these spinons are descendents of the 1d excitations of the chains formed by the strong @xmath7 bonds , and not characteristic of any exotic 2d state . a popular argument </S>",
    "<S> _ against _ this notion has been that the peak energy has substantial dispersion in the direction _ </S>",
    "<S> transverse _ to the chains . </S>",
    "<S> we show that contrary to nave expectations , such dispersion does appear in a quasi-1d approach . </S>",
    "<S> the basic physics involved is the _ binding _ of two spinons into a delocalized and dispersing spin-1 pair ( triplon ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is driven by kinetic energy , since only a pair of spinons may hop between chains . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is a lower dimensional analogue of anderson s interlayer tunneling mechanism of high temperature superconductivity , with spinon pairs replacing cooper pairs@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> triplon formation leads to specific signatures in the structure factor _ which are indeed present in the data on cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1_.    the appropriateness of the 1d approach is reinforced by several works . </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite demonstrated that it quantitatively reproduces most of the complex low temperature phase diagram observed in applied magnetic fields in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it also showed that the frustrated @xmath20 coupling is ineffective in establishing long - range order : the characteristic energy scale for ordering is only of order @xmath21 , much smaller than the bare @xmath20 inter - chain exchange energy . </S>",
    "<S> an early indication of this ineffectiveness appeared in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which a `` decoupled '' state was suggested . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the exact diagonalization study in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found that correlations between spins in neighboring chains remain extremely weak for @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the elementary excitations ( spinons ) of independent spin chains are a natural basis . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore _ project _ the hamiltonian in eq . into the subspace of eigenstates of the 1d decoupled chains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each eigenstate can be characterized by the _ number of excited spinons _ , which is always even for any physical state . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , truncating to the first non - trivial approximation of only zero- or two - spinon states reproduces the main features of the spectrum of such quasi - one - dimensional frustrated antiferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> note that the two - spinon approximation is _ not _ a low - energy one ( unlike the familiar and powerful `` bosonization '' technique ) as it includes spinons with energies reaching up to @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this is essential for comparison with inelastic neutron scattering data which extends over this full range.@xcite    the two - spinon states of a single chain are characterized by two continuous quantum numbers , which can be thought of either as the momenta @xmath24 of the individual ( unbound ) spinons , or equivalently , the total momentum @xmath25 and ( excitation ) energy @xmath26 of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> we use the latter notation for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> the spinon energy is given by des cloizeaux - pearson dispersion , @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the states can also be characterized by their total spin and @xmath28 quantum numbers . only the triplet ( @xmath29 ) states are relevant to the neutron structure factor , and one may specialize without loss of generality to the @xmath30 state , which we denote @xmath31 on chain @xmath32 . for the many - chain system , </S>",
    "<S> the unperturbed ground state and two - spinon basis states are given as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath35 denotes the ground state of the @xmath32-th heisenberg chain , of length @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose to work with eigenstates of the total 2d momentum vector @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> such @xmath38 eigenstates are superpositions : latexmath:[$|\\epsilon\\rangle_{\\bf k}\\equiv |k_x , k_y ; \\epsilon\\rangle\\equiv \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{l_y}}\\sum_y{\\rm e}^{{\\rm i } k_y y }    chains ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that , because the two spinons comprising any of the original basis states always live in the same chain , there is only one intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath38 and not two distinct spinon momenta in the @xmath32 direction . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is only a one parameter ( @xmath40 ) set of two - spinon states for each @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the eigenstates in this basis take the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the density of states of the heisenberg chain , divided by @xmath44 , at momentum @xmath45 and excitation energy @xmath40 @xcite ( @xmath46 denotes the step function ) . </S>",

    "<S> the wavefunction @xmath50 defines the spread of the eigenstate amongst this continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the condition that @xmath51 is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian in the 2-spinon subspace implies the schrdinger equation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the excitation energy above the ground state , and @xmath54 is the fourier transform of the interchain exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element @xmath55 , which is crucial for this study , was obtained exactly in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> we solved the integral equation , eq . </S>",
    "<S> , numerically by carefully discretizing @xmath40 to obtain a complete ( in the two spinon subspace ) set of eigenfunctions @xmath56 ( and corresponding states @xmath57 ) and energies @xmath58 , with @xmath59 . here we typically took the number of discretized energies @xmath60 to be several thousand , as large as necessary to ensure good resolution . knowing these eigenstates </S>",
    "<S> , we can directly evaluate their contribution to the zero temperature dynamical structure factor @xmath61 : @xmath62 for consistency , we approximate the ground state @xmath63 by its perturbative form to first order in @xmath64 , though the linear correction term has little effect on the results . </S>",
    "<S> details are given in the supplementary material .    </S>",
    "<S> somewhat unexpectedly , it is possible to show analytically that the structure factor obtained in this way has nearly the same form as found in the well - known random phase approximation ( rpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as shown in the supplementary material , when the @xmath65 correction to the ground state is neglected , @xmath66 ^ 2 + [ j'({\\bf k } ) \\chi_{1d}''(k_x,\\omega)]^2}. \\label{eq : rpa}\\ ] ] here @xmath67 is the two - spinon structure factor of a single chain @xcite , and @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this nearly coincides with the rpa expression , which is obtained by replacing our @xmath69 with the dynamic susceptibility of a single chain , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 differs from @xmath72 by a small contribution from @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the differences between the rpa and our two - spinon result , with or without the ground state correction , are very small in all situations of interest  see supplementary material .    </S>",
    "<S> we find three types of distinctive spectral features depending on the momentum , determined by the value of @xmath64 :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 : @xmath12 has a @xmath75-function peak below the continuous spectrum . a typical example is shown in fig .  [ fig : skw ]  ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , this peak arises from a triplon bound state of two spinons , @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the triplon dispersion @xmath77 is determined from the pole of where @xmath78 and @xmath79 outside the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the pole appears below @xmath80 because there @xmath81 is positive . </S>",
    "<S> the inter - chain dispersion of the triplon is due to the @xmath38-dependence of @xmath64 . in the weak interchain - coupling regime , the spectral weight @xmath82 and binding energy @xmath83 of the peak are small , and behave as @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( up to logarithmic corrections ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath86 : the spectral weight shifts upwards , and the peak is broadened in the continuum , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : skw ]  ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a suppression of spectral weight at the lower edge of the continuum occurs due to repulsion between the two spinons . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath87 is sufficiently large , a @xmath75-function peak appears _ above _ the two - spinon continuum . </S>",
    "<S> this peak corresponds to an anti - bound triplon state . </S>",

    "<S> mode of a neutral interacting fermi gas@xcite .    since in most cases , weakly coupled spin chains _ do _ eventually order at low enough temperature , it is important to understand the validity of our scheme in this situation . for this , it is crucial that we consider _ frustrated _ inter - chain couplings ( @xmath11 ) . in this case , the leading divergence associated with coupling neighboring chains  the strong tendency to nel order at @xmath90 within each chain  is removed because @xmath124 . without this condition , one obtains@xcite strong long - range nel order which influences spectral features on the scale of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> since this effect is comparable to those captured by the two - spinon approximation , the latter is unjustified without frustration . with frustration , </S>",
    "<S> any fluctuation - induced order has a much smaller characteristic energy scale@xcite , and can be neglected compared to the shifts of excited states captured by the present approach . of course </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of _ any _ long - range order , however weak , does modify some excitations in a qualitative manner . </S>",
    "<S> the triplon , when present , is expected to transform smoothly into a magnon as a consequence . in regions of momentum space where no bound state is present below the continuum , @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> , a magnon may weakly emerge as a consequence of long - range order .    </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous important directions for extensions and applications </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to compare with neutron measurements of cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 , which is isostructural and can be modeled similarly to cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 but with somewhat larger @xmath125@xcite , and to search for signs of the anti - bound triplon in either material . </S>",
    "<S> some theoretical extensions would be to include three - dimensional and dyzaloshinskii - moriya couplings , systematically treat higher - spinon states , to include thermal fluctuations at @xmath126 , and to take into account weak long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> a very interesting different direction is to apply analogous methods to spatially anisotropic strongly interacting _ conductors _ , modeled by hubbard or @xmath127-@xmath7 type hamiltonians . given the very small arsenal of theoretical techniques capable of reliably obtaining intermediate energy spectra in strongly interacting systems above one dimension , further investigation of such methodology seems highly worthwhile . </S>",
