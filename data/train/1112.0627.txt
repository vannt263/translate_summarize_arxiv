    "recently , a holographic version of wilsonian renormalization group ( hwrg ) has been proposed to describe field theories with a finite cut - off @xcite .",
    "the essential idea of hwrg is to integrate out the bulk field from the boundary up to some intermediate radial distance .",
    "the radial direction in the bulk marks the energy scale of the boundary theory and the radial flow in the bulk geometry can be interpreted as the renormalization group flow of the boundary theory@xcite . moreover ,",
    "some evidence has been presented in @xcite indicating that the membrane paradigm and the hwrg method are probably equivalent .    in @xcite and later in @xcite , it was shown that the diffusion coefficient for reissner - nordstrom - anti de sitter(rn - ads ) black holes can be calculated in the scaling limit without explicit decoupling procedure . in @xcite",
    ", the authors discussed the mixing effect between metric fluctuation and maxwell fluctuation in rn - ads spacetime .",
    "they firstly derived the diffusion constant through the mixed rg flow equations , and then turn to the standard hydrodynamic calculation on the cut - off surface by decoupling the equations of motion .",
    "it was found that the results through the rg flow approach match those through the hydrodynamic calculation in good agreements .    in this paper",
    ", we intend to apply these approaches to investigate the vector - type fluctuations in einstein - gauss - bonnet - maxwell theory .",
    "so far , the diffusion coefficient for charged black holes in this theory has not been computed in the previous literature .",
    "it is also interesting to study the electric conductivity , charge susceptibility and thermal conductivity of the dual fluid in this theory .",
    "unlike the rn - ads spacetime , the equations of motion , followed the method given in @xcite , are essentially failed to be decoupled because of the mixing of the gauss - bonnet coupling and the charge .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we intend to disclose one advantage of the membrane paradigm and the hwrg approach , which tell us that even the equations of motion can not be decoupled , one can still calculate the transport coefficients analytically .",
    "we will generalize the strategy presented in @xcite to calculate the cutoff - dependent diffusion constant @xmath0 when the gauss - bonnet terms are involved .",
    "we will also investigate the dc conductivity at an arbitrary radius by using the kubo formula without obtaining the decoupled matter equations as in @xcite .",
    "the charge susceptibility and the thermal conductivity are also evaluated .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the ratio of the conductivity to the susceptibility may obey a universal bound . in @xcite , it was shown that this bound is violated in the framework of general four - derivative interactions .",
    "we will extend this discussion in the gauss - bonnet gravity in this paper as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present our basic setup for the vector type perturbation following the notation in @xcite .",
    "we define the effective `` current '' and `` strength '' for the perturbation fields , and then rewrite the equations of motion in a form similar to the maxwell equation . in section 3 ,",
    "we first investigate the ac conductivity of the dual plasma with the use of the numerical analysis .",
    "then we study the dc conductivity flow at an arbitrary radius through the kubo formula . following the method developed in @xcite",
    ", we calculate the diffusion constant in the scaling limit .",
    "the resulting formula for the diffusion constant reproduces the old result from the membrane paradigm in the absence of the gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "we then provide a consistent check on the obtained diffusion constant by employing the brown - york tensor on the cutoff surface .",
    "conclusion and discussion are presented in section 4 .",

    "the charge density evaluated at the asymptotic boundary is @xmath28 .",
    "the constant @xmath29 in the metric ( [ metric ] ) can be fixed by requiring that the geometry of the spacetime should asymptotically approach to the conformaly flat metric at spatial infinity , i.e.  @xmath30 . since as @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 one can find @xmath29 to be @xmath33 without loss of generality , in the following of this paper we will mainly focus on five - dimensional case @xmath34 with @xmath35 . after introducing the coordinate as follows u= ,   h(u)=f(u ) ,   f(u)=(1- ) ,",
