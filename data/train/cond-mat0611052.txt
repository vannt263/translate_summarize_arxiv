    "heat transport in solids is often very sensitive to even weak disorder and is significantly influenced by phase transitions .",
    "that is why measurements of the thermal conductivity are an efficient experimental tool in solid state physics .",
    "several books and review articles were devoted to thermal conduction in solids.@xcite these previous authors usually discussed the heat transport by two species of itinerant quasiparticles only , i.e. , by considering the thermal conductivity by phonons ( @xmath0 ) and by itinerant charge carriers ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "even when dealing with magnetic systems , the influence of magnetic excitations is typically seen in a reduction of the phonon and electron thermal conductivities via scattering of these quasiparticles by magnons or magnetic impurities .",
    "the heat transport via the spin system itself was , to a large extent , neglected .",
    "one of the main reasons for this imbalance is that usually , it is very difficult to separate the spin contribution ( @xmath2 ) from the total measured thermal conductivity which , in most cases , is dominated by phonon heat transport .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for antiferromagnetic ( afm ) three - dimensional ( 3d ) materials where the linear dispersion of the spin excitations causes , at low enough temperatures , @xmath2 to adopt a @xmath3 dependence , the same as @xmath4 .",
    "a much more favorable situation is met in strongly anisotropic spin systems , such as spin - chain materials , where the exchange interaction along a particular direction is much stronger than perpendicular to it . since no thermal conductivity via spin excitations",
    "is expected perpendicular to the chain direction , investigating the anisotropy of the heat transport is an efficient method for the identification of @xmath2 .",
    "what really makes spin - chain materials very attractive objects for transport measurements is , however , the influence of quantum effects on their properties , which are most pronounced for low spin values ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .    unusual transport of energy and magnetization in certain 1d quantum spin systems was predicted long ago.@xcite more recent theoretical studies along these lines induced a revival of interest in unusual transport properties of integrable spin systems.@xcite during the last decade , many new results have been obtained for transport properties of various 1d quantum spin models , not only for the  simple  case involving an isotropic nearest - neighbor interaction , but also taking into account higher - order neighbor interactions , frustration effects and coupling to phonons . in addition , more complex 1d spin arrangements such as ladders and zig - zag chains were considered .",
    "the resulting theoretical progress was reviewed in recent articles .",
    "this progress , linked to recent advances in preparation of materials whose features seem to fulfill some of the assumptions of the various idealized models quite well , has led to a considerable activity in experimental studies of heat conduction in 1d spin systems .",
    "a corresponding summary of earlier activities was given in ref .  .",
    "in this article , we present a brief survey of recent experimental results on the thermal conductivity via excitations in 1d afm spin systems .",
    "heat transport in the 3d ordered spin state caused by weak yet unavoidable interchain interactions is not discussed here since it allows for a conventional description in terms of well - defined quasiparticles ( magnons ) .",
    "we do not attempt to provide a full account of all the published papers on thermal conductivity of spin - chain materials , but rather concentrate on several central topics where some experimental progress has recently been achieved .",
    "first , we discuss whether the observed thermal transport in spin - chain compounds indeed reflects the expectations that emerged from the mentioned theoretical work .",
    "then , we discuss what type of information on perturbations affecting the spin - mediated transport can be extracted from recent experimental data .",
    "since most of the model materials are insulators , the dominating influence is due to the interaction of the spin system with phonons as well as with magnetic defects .",
    "another issue that we address here is how the predicted relations between thermal conductivity and spin conductivity in low - dimensional spin systems were attempted to be verified in recent experiments .",
    "finally , we discuss some features of the thermal conductivity of spin chains in external magnetic fields .",
    "in the modern theoretical literature , the energy transport in 1d spin systems has been addressed employing either the boltzmann transport equation formalism or the linear response formalism .",
    "the former approach , which relies on the notion of quasiparticle modes with associated velocities and relaxation times , provides transparent results and is well suited for the analysis of experimental data .",
    "however , this quasiparticle picture is not always applicable for quantum many - body systems .",
    "thus , the most widely used approach was directed towards the calculation of transport coefficients via time - dependent current - current correlation functions , due to kubo.@xcite for the thermal conductivity at a finite frequency @xmath7,@xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy current and @xmath10 denotes the thermodynamic average .",
    "the real part of eq .",
    "( [ kappa_vs_w ] ) can be decomposed into @xmath11 where the weight of the singular part ( @xmath12 ) is the so - called thermal drude weight .",
    "the experimentally accessible quantity is the @xmath13 conductivity @xmath14 .",
    "a nonzero @xmath12 implies a non - decaying energy current and , thus , ballistic heat transport .",
    "since the energy current is one of the conserved quantities,@xcite the existence of a nonzero drude weight is often linked with the integrability of a system .",
    "the question whether @xmath12 may , for various spin systems , adopt a nonzero value and how it evolves under the influence of different perturbations are the central points of current theoretical studies of thermal transport in quantum spin systems .",
    "the thermal drude weight @xmath15 is as important for thermal transport as is the drude weight @xmath16 for electric transport where its value at @xmath17 distinguishes an ideal conductor ( @xmath18 ) from an insulator(@xmath19 ) , as was put forward by kohn.@xcite extending kohn s conjecture to heat transport and to nonzero temperatures,@xcite several cases can be distinguished : + ( a ) thermal insulators if @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; + ( b ) conventional thermal conductors if @xmath20 and @xmath22 ; + ( c ) ideal thermal conductors if @xmath23 for any value of @xmath24.@xcite    however , an experimentally observed , anomalously large @xmath13 thermal conductivity does not necessary imply a ballistic thermal transport ( case ( c ) ) .",
    "it is also possible that , even if @xmath25 ( case ( b ) ) , the low-@xmath7 part of @xmath26 may adopt anomalously large values for certain systems with slowly decaying energy currents .",
    "even if calculations for an idealized pure system suggest the existence of a nonzero drude weight , in any real system , perturbations such as phonons , 3d couplings , or defects may destroy the integrability of the system . as a result",
    ", the @xmath27-peak broadens into a lorentzian with a width inversely proportional to the relaxation time @xmath28 , the value of which depends on the type and strength of the perturbation , and the thermal conductivity is reduced accordingly .",
    "thus , only a comparison of experimental data with theoretical calculations , taking into account both the singular and the regular parts of the conductivity spectrum , provides a reliable judgement of the situation .",
    "real materials of current interest which may be regarded as reasonable physical realizations of model low - dimensional spin @xmath29 systems belong to three classes : @xmath5 chains , @xmath6 chains , and two - leg @xmath5 ladders .",
    "an often encountered case is the heisenberg @xmath5 xxz chain , for which the hamiltonian is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the intrachain nearest - neighbor exchange coupling and @xmath32 characterizes the anisotropy of the interaction .",
    "the excitations are pairs of @xmath5 quasiparticles ( spinons ) and the spectrum consists of a continuum with an upper and a lower boundary .",
    "it is gapless for @xmath33 but a spin gap opens for larger @xmath34 .",
    "the isotropic case @xmath35 is especially important because a number of model systems with @xmath36 ranging from quite high ( e.g. , sr@xmath37cuo@xmath38 with @xmath39  k)@xcite to rather low values ( cupzn with @xmath40  k)@xcite have been realized in appropriate material syntheses .",
    "systems which are described by eq .",
    "( [ ehamiltonian12 ] ) are integrable for @xmath41 ( easy plane ) as well as for @xmath35 ( isotropic ) . in several theoretical papers and using different methodical approaches it has unambiguously been demonstrated that at @xmath42 , the thermal drude weight is nonzero if @xmath43.@xcite other work established the thermal transport in @xmath5 chains in the gapped phases , such as xxz chains with ising - type anisotropy @xmath44,@xcite with next - nearest neighbor interactions,@xcite with three - spin interactions,@xcite with dimerization and frustrations.@xcite for @xmath45 , some calculations predicted a nonzero @xmath12 in the massive regime;@xcite other studies question this conclusion for dimerized and frustrated chains , however.@xcite    the same uncertainty about @xmath46 exists for @xmath6 chain systems .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the isotropic afm @xmath6 model has a large gap ; the system is nonintegrable .",
    "although earlier calculations provided support for a nonzero thermal drude weight at all temperatures,@xcite more recent work suggests that @xmath15 vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite in the latter case , the thermal conductivity of the spin system is expected to be completely governed by the regular contribution @xmath47 .",
    "a great deal of recent theoretical interest concentrated on the transport properties of two - leg @xmath5 ladders .",
    "this interest was stimulated by experimental observations of a rather large spin thermal conductivity along the ladder direction in variants of ( ca , sr)@xmath48cu@xmath49o@xmath50 which contains spin ladders as a structural element.@xcite the ladders are @xmath5 chains ( legs ) connected in pairs , with an exchange constant @xmath36 along the legs and @xmath51 perpendicular to the legs ( along the rungs ) .",
    "the interaction along the rungs is the integrability - breaking perturbation because for @xmath52 , the system is just a set of @xmath5 chains as described above . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the situation with the thermal drude weight is controversial , similar to other nonintegrable systems with spin gaps mentioned above : the nonzero thermal drude weight calculated for this system disagrees with more recent numerical calculations.@xcite    measurements of the thermal conductivity were made for several physical realizations of 1d spin systems . before discussing the experimental results for @xmath2",
    ", we wish to mention some aspects of ambiguity in the data analysis .",
    "the standard method of measuring the components of the thermal conductivity tensor @xmath54 relies on the fourier law of proportionality @xmath55 linking the heat flux @xmath56 and the temperature gradient @xmath57 . the heat flux is typically directed along one of the main crystallographic axes , e.g. @xmath58 , therefore we consider @xmath59 .",
    "the measured thermal conductivity always includes contributions from all delocalized excitations acting as heat carriers .",
    "therefore , separating the spin thermal conductivity @xmath2 from contributions of phonons @xmath0 , electronic quasiparticles @xmath1 etc .",
    ", is , in general , not straightforward .",
    "although @xmath1 is negligibly small or zero for most studied spin - chain compounds , the phonon contribution is always larger or , at least , of the same order of magnitude as @xmath2 . in principle",
    ", one may try to reduce @xmath0 by introducing some lattice defects which scatter phonons much stronger than spin excitations .",
    "this step has successfully been applied to the spin - ladder compounds ( sr , ca , la)@xmath48cu@xmath49o@xmath50.@xcite unfortunately , the deliberately introduced disorder produces some unavoidable additional scattering of spin excitations as well .",
    "the most widely used approach for establishing @xmath2 exploits the fact that , because of very weak interchain interactions , the spin contribution to the transport perpendicular to the chains is usually negligible . thus , for establishing the spin contribution one has to compare the thermal conductivity @xmath60 measured parallel to the chains ( which contains both @xmath61 and @xmath2 ) with the thermal conductivity @xmath62 perpendicular to the chains ( which contains only @xmath0 ) . still , because of the possible anisotropy of phonon transport , this method is , in some cases , only partly successful in avoiding substantial uncertainties in the evaluation of @xmath63 .",
    "this is especially the case in the vicinity of phase transitions , where the phonon scattering by critical fluctuations is often very strong and not necessarily isotropic .",
    "for example , the existence of thermal conduction via the spin system was discussed for the @xmath5 chain cuprate cugeo@xmath38.@xcite here the cu atoms are linked via superexchange with @xmath64=10.4  mev along the chain direction ( @xmath65 axis ) , while in the perpendicular directions , the coupling is at least an order of magnitude weaker ( @xmath66 and @xmath67).@xcite the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity @xmath68 along the chain direction exhibits a two - peak structure .",
    "it has been speculated that the higher - temperature peak is caused by the spin contribution to @xmath68 , while the lower - temperature peak is of phononic origin.@xcite however , the same features are also observed for @xmath69 , where @xmath2 is expected to be negligible.@xcite taking into account that the spin - peierls transition occurs exactly between the two peaks at @xmath70 , the two - peak feature may safely be attributed to phonon transport with enhanced scattering close to the transition.@xcite as a result , despite the large amount of experimental work on thermal transport in cugeo@xmath38 , the identification of spin - carried heat conduction in this material has not been established unequivocally .",
    "a similar situation is met for the s = 1/2 chain compounds kcuf@xmath38 and bacu@xmath37si@xmath37o@xmath71 . because of moderately weak interchain interactions , the 3d magnetic ordering sets in at relatively high temperatures ( 39.8  k and 9.2  k for kcuf@xmath38 and bacu@xmath37si@xmath37o@xmath71 , respectively ) and is reflected in the temperature dependences of @xmath0 and @xmath2.@xcite    only when the temperature dependences of the thermal conductivities perpendicular to the chains are smooth and featureless , they can be used for evaluating the phonon background parallel to the chains .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ ladchains ] .",
    "for the two materials , @xmath69 exhibits a single peak at low temperatures and , at elevated temperature , @xmath69 varies approximately as @xmath72 which is typical for phonon thermal conduction of non - magnetic insulators.@xcite in turn , the thermal conductivity parallel to chains @xmath68 shows , on top of the phonon contribution , a distinct additional feature at higher temperatures .",
    "these extra contributions were attributed to thermal transport via the spin system , represented by @xmath73 .",
    "the phonon background @xmath74 can be analyzed and subtracted from @xmath68 but it is obvious that the uncertainties in @xmath63 are large for temperatures where the phonon background dominates .",
    "if we now turn to the experimental results so far obtained for @xmath63 , the main question is whether these results are consistent with the ballistic heat transport expected for integrable systems .",
    "if we define ballistic transport as transport where the mean free path of the excitations is limited by the sample dimensions , then the answer would be negative .",
    "the mean free path @xmath75 of 1d spin excitations can roughly be evaluated using the kinetic equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the magnetic specific heat and @xmath78 is the mean velocity of spin excitations .",
    "the data for @xmath79 are available for @xmath5 chain materials , such as sr@xmath80cuo@xmath81,@xcite srcuo@xmath80,@xcite bacu@xmath37si@xmath37o@xmath71,@xcite cugeo@xmath81,@xcite yb@xmath82as@xmath38,@xcite as well as for the @xmath6 chain materials agvp@xmath37s@xmath83,@xcite and y@xmath37banio@xmath84,@xcite and some variants of the @xmath5 two - leg ladder compound ( ca , sr , la)@xmath48cu@xmath49o@xmath50.@xcite in all cases , @xmath75 was never larger than a few @xmath85   , much shorter than the lateral extensions of typical samples which were of the order of 1  mm .",
    "however , a more general definition of ballistic transport is provided by the presence of non - decaying contributions to the energy current which can be shown to be equivalent to the existence of a nonzero drude weight .",
    "this definition is more appropriate because it does not rely on the validity of the quasiparticle approach . applying this criterion in analyzing the experimental results of steady - state heat transport experiments ,",
    "the identification of the ballistic transport relies on demonstrating that the measured @xmath2 exceeds the values of the thermal conductivity provided by the regular contribution in eq .",
    "( [ rekappa ] ) .",
    "experimental data available in the literature indeed seem to support the theoretical predictions which claim ballistic thermal transport in @xmath5 uniform heisenberg chains and diffusive transport in @xmath6 chains . in fig .  [ de ] , we plot the spin - related energy diffusion constants @xmath86 that were calculated from experimental data of @xmath63 for several spin - chain compounds@xcite by using @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the specific heat of the spin chain and @xmath89 the lattice constant along the chains .",
    "for @xmath6 chains , the energy diffusion constant has recently been calculated from the regular contribution @xmath47 for high temperatures.@xcite the high - temperature limiting value @xmath90 is indicated by an arrow in fig .  [ de ] . for both @xmath6 compounds presented in fig .",
    "[ de ] the energy diffusion constants are clearly of the same order of magnitude as @xmath90 values .",
    "in contrast , @xmath91 for the @xmath5 chains are much larger than for the @xmath6 species , they exhibit a strong temperature dependence and do not scale with @xmath92 , as one would expect for diffusion that is governed by intrinsic interactions only . taking into account that the theory predicts @xmath93 for @xmath5 chains in the gapless regime , this comparison strongly suggests that intrinsic diffusion is the dominating process in @xmath6 chains but much less so in @xmath5 chains .",
    "a comparison between calculated values of @xmath26 and experimental results for @xmath63 has recently been made for two - leg spin ladders.@xcite this comparison suggests that the experimentally observed thermal conductivity via the spin system is governed by intrinsic diffusion .",
    "the emerging understanding of the dichotomy between diffusive and ballistic transport in 1d spin systems is that the thermal transport in systems with a spin gap , such as @xmath6 chains or @xmath5 even - leg ladders , is determined by intrinsic diffusion , while for @xmath5 spin chains with gapless spectra , the thermal transport is ballistic and limited by external perturbations .",
    "although most of the relevant theoretical work was based on the kubo formalism , the analysis of experimental data on the thermal conductivity of low dimensional spin systems is usually employing boltzmann s kinetic transport theory . in this approximation",
    "@xmath94    where @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath78 , and @xmath75 are , respectively , the distribution function , the energy , the velocity , and the mean free path of spin excitations with wavevector @xmath97 .",
    "the mean free path @xmath75 is related to the relaxation time @xmath98 as @xmath99 . assuming that several scattering mechanisms act independently of each other , in most cases a good approximation for the total mean free path is @xmath100 where each @xmath101 term corresponds to an independent scattering channel . in order to keep the analysis tractable ,",
    "in most experimental papers it is usually assumed that the scattering rates are @xmath97-independent , such that @xmath102 .",
    "this assumption is often questionable but largely dictated by the lack of properly developed theoretical formalisms describing the relevant scattering processes of spin excitations in 1d systems .",

    "there is no doubt that magnetic defects are very effective scatterers of spin excitations in 1d magnetic systems .",
    "however , the convenient assumption that @xmath105 is @xmath104- and @xmath97-independent , seems not to be justified in general .",
    "the scattering of spin excitations by impurities and disorder was addressed theoretically in refs .   for gapless @xmath5 chains .",

    "it was found that the lifetime of spin excitations is energy dependent for the single - impurity case , and the situation is even more complicated for higher concentrations of impurities .",
    "another species of scatterers needs to be taken into account in analyzing the data for the spin - ladder compound ( ca , sr)@xmath48cu@xmath49o@xmath50 where , depending on the chemical composition , different concentrations of mobile holes are present in the ladders . in ref .",
    "it was suggested that in sr@xmath106ca@xmath107cu@xmath49o@xmath50 ( @xmath108 ) the holes are the principal scatterers of magnons at high temperatures .",

    "the role of phonons is not restricted to serving as a reservoir for the exchange of energy and momentum with the quasiparticles of the spin system in the related scattering processes .",
    "first of all , a non - vanishing interaction between the lattice and the spin system is necessary for the very observability of @xmath2 in a typical thermal conductivity experiment , where the heat flux is first introduced into the phonon subsystem and then redistributed between phonons and spin excitations.@xcite since in an experiment probing the thermal conductivity , the spin excitations interact with phonons which are not in equilibrium but have a nonzero net momentum along the temperature gradient , these interactions lead to a redistribution of momentum between phonons and spin excitations .",

    "the concentration of magnetic defects was relatively high , leaving the possibility that intrinsic features of the thermal conductivity are masked . also for the probed spin - ladder materials , the experimentally observed large heat flow carried by spins does not seem to contradict the possibility of diffusive transport governed by intrinsic interactions . in order to clarify this situation ,",
    "more experimental work is needed .    concerning the integrable spin systems with gapless excitation spectra , the most important problem is to establish , how the spin thermal conductivity is affected by various possible integrability - breaking perturbations , such as dimerization , frustration , weak interchain coupling , next - nearest - neighbor interactions , anisotropic interactions , various types of disorder , and coupling to phonons .",
    "very little experimental work has been done in this direction . even for the most extensively studied case of scattering by defects ,",
    "the @xmath104 - and @xmath97-dependence of the corresponding scattering rate is not yet established unambiguously .",
    "for progress in this direction , model materials that allow for a controlled alteration of different perturbations are required .    in spite of the rich variety of phenomena predicted by theory ,",
    "very little experimental work has been done on the influence of magnetic fields on the spin - carried heat conduction in 1d spin systems .",
    "progress in this area requires materials with weak intrachain exchange and yet much weaker interchain interactions . besides variations in the thermal conductivity , a number of interesting new features in magnetothermal transport are expected to be observed .",
    "this paper is dedicated to professor hilbert von lhneysen on the occasion of his 60th birthday .",
