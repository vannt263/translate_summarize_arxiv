    "we consider a general system of @xmath0 chemical species @xcite inside a fixed volume with @xmath1 denoting the number of molecules .",
    "the stoichiometric matrix @xmath2 describes changes in the population size due to @xmath3 different reaction channels , where each @xmath4 describes the change in the number of molecules of type @xmath5 from @xmath6 to @xmath7 caused by an event of type @xmath8 .",
    "the probability that event @xmath8 occurs during the time interval @xmath9 equals @xmath10 , where the @xmath11 are called the transition rates .",
    "this specification leads to a poisson birth and death process described by the following stochastic equations @xcite    @xmath12    where the @xmath13 are independent poisson processes with rate 1 .    in order to define the contribution of the @xmath8th reaction @xmath14 to the variability of @xmath15",
    "we first define @xmath16 as the expectation of @xmath17 conditioned on the processes @xmath18 so that @xmath19 is a random variable where timings of reaction @xmath8 have been averaged over all possible times , keeping all other reactions fixed .",
    "therefore @xmath20 is a random variable representing the difference between the native process @xmath17 and a time - averaged process of the @xmath8th reaction . now",
    "the contribution of the @xmath8th reaction to the total variability of @xmath15 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the temporal average over all @xmath3 reactions .",
    "this definition is similar to the one proposed in @xcite to quantify the contributions of promoter states and mrna fluctuations , respectively , to the protein level variability .    in general , it is difficult to calculate or study properties of equation ( [ contrib_def ] ) using a poisson birth and death process framework ( [ kurtz_x ] ) . here",
    "instead we use the linear noise approximation ( lna ) , which allows us to model stochastic systems using wiener processes driven @xmath23 instead of poisson processes driven @xmath24 stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "the lna is valid if the number of interacting molecules is sufficiently large @xcite and decomposes the system s state , @xmath25 , into a deterministic part @xmath26 and a stochastic part @xmath27 @xmath28 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are described by the deterministic and stochastic differential equations @xmath29 respectively , and their coefficients are given by the following formulae @xmath30 the lna presents a simple way to compute contributions @xmath31 , and here we demonstrate how the total variance can be decomposed into the sum of individual contributions .",
    "we first write the explicit solution for the process @xmath32 as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fundamental matrix of the non - autonomous system of ordinary differential equations and @xmath36 instead of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath39 now it is straightforward to verify that @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 from ( [ sol_xi ] ) and ( [ xi_j ] ) we have @xmath46 with @xmath47 and the time derivative of @xmath48 we obtain for @xmath31 , @xmath49 with @xmath50 this is , of course , analogous to the fluctuation dissipation theorem , with the exception that the diffusion matrix contains zeros at all entries not corresponding to the @xmath8th reaction .",
    "now the fact that the total variance @xmath51 can be represented as the sum of individual contributions @xmath52 results directly from the decomposition of the diffusion matrix @xmath53 and the linearity of the equation for @xmath54 , given by the standard fluctuation dissipation theorem @xmath55",
    "with the decomposition ( [ sigmaj_sum ] ) it is in principle possible to detect reactions that make large contributions to the output variability of biochemical reactions .",
    "but even simple systems , for which analytic formulae exist , usually have complicated noise structures ; we can nevertheless prove two general propositions that assign surprisingly substantial contributions to the degradation of an output signal .",
    "we formulate them in this section ( proofs are in the _ appendix _ ) and illustrate them further below .",
    "consider a general system such as described at the beginning of the _ noise decomposition _ section .",
    "in addition , assume that the deterministic component of the system @xmath56 has a unique and stable stationary state ( all eigenvalues of matrix @xmath57 have negative real parts ) . if @xmath58 is an output of this system being produced at rate @xmath59 and degraded in the @xmath3th reaction at rate @xmath60 then the contribution of the output s degradation is equal to the half of its mean ; more specifically , @xmath61_{nn}=\\frac{1}{2 } \\langle x_n \\rangle.\\ ] ]      now consider again a general system but assume that reaction rates are of mass action form and that only three types of reactions are allowed :    production from source : : :    @xmath62 degradation : : :    @xmath63 conversion : : :    @xmath64 .",
    "to satisfy the openness assumption each species can be created and degraded either directly or indirectly ( via a series of preceding conversion reactions ) . as in _ proposition 1 _",
    "let @xmath58 be the output of the system .",
    "under this assumption the degradation of the output contributes exactly half of the total variance of the system s output , @xmath65_{nn}=\\frac{1}{2 }   \\left[\\sigma\\right]_{nn},\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is again the index of the output s degradation reaction .",
    "_ proposition 2 _ can be understood as a balance between production and degradation reactions .",
    "if we consider all reactions except @xmath3th as producing species @xmath58 , then production and degradation contribute the same amount of noise .",
    "usually , however , there is more than one production reaction , and therefore it is more convenient to interpret this result as the contribution of a single reaction .",
    "both propositions indicate that a substantial part of noise is a result of the signal s degradation reaction .",
    "this observation is particularly interesting as open conversion systems are often good approximations to important biochemical reactions such as michaelis - menten enzymatic conversions or linear signal transduction pathways , which we discuss below ; it suggests also that controlled degradation is an effective mechanism to decrease the overall contribution to variation in protein levels .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how our methods can be used to study origins of noise in biochemical systems and present consequences of the above propositions .      for illustrative purposes we start with a basic birth and death process , where molecules @xmath66 arrive at rate @xmath67 and degrade at rate @xmath68 .",
    "in the lna this process can be expressed by the following stochastic differential equation @xmath69 the stationary distribution of this system is poisson with the mean @xmath70 .",
    "therefore in the stationary state death events occur at rate @xmath71 which must be equal the birth rate @xmath67 .",
    "the noise terms in the above equation are equal at stationarity indicating that contributions of birth and death reactions are equal .",
    "using formula ( [ sigma_j ] ) it is straightforward to verify that the decomposition @xmath72 holds indeed .",
    "here we first focus on conversion pathways , where molecules @xmath73 are born at a certain rate @xmath74 and information is transmitted to molecules @xmath58 using ( possibly reversible ) conversion reactions .",
    "all molecules can degrade with arbitrary first order rates , and we assume that the final product @xmath58 is not the substrate of any conversion reaction . under these assumptions ,",
    "regardless of parameter values , length of the pathway , and degradation of intermediates , the degradation of the output @xmath58 , rather unexpectedly , contributes exactly half of the variance of the signalling output , @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "if information is transmitted not using conversion reactions , but each species catalyses the creation of the subsequent species , i.e. @xmath75 , then according to the _ proposition 1 _ , the contribution of the degradation of @xmath58 to the output s variance equals half of its mean regardless of the cascade length and parameter values .    in order to study contributions of intermediate reactions , we considered cascades of the length three ( see figure [ cascades_arrows ] ) and decomposed variances numerically for both conversion and catalytic cases .",
    "decompositions are presented in figure [ cascades ] . for conversion cascades we used two parameter sets corresponding to fast and slow conversions to demonstrate that increasing the rates of intermediate steps decreases their contribution as",
    "might intuitively be predicted ( top panel of figure [ cascades ] ) . for catalytic cascades increasing the rates of reactions at step two and three ( going from slow to fast )",
    "increases the contribution of reactions at the bottom of the cascades . for slow dynamics during steps two and three ,",
    "the relatively fast fluctuations at the start are filtered out ( low pass filtering ) .",
    "if the dynamics of all species occur at similar times scales then these fluctuation can efficiently propagate downstream ( bottom panel of figure [ cascades ] ) .",
    "michaelis - menten enzyme kinetics are fundamental examples of biochemical reactions ; substrate molecules ( @xmath76 ) bind reversibly to enzyme molecules ( @xmath77 ) with the forward rate constant @xmath78 and the backward rate constant @xmath79 to form a complex ( @xmath80 ) , which then falls apart into the enzyme and a product ( @xmath81 ) at rate @xmath82 : @xmath83 . to ensure existence of the steady state",
    ", we assume that substrate molecules arrive at rate @xmath84 and are degraded at rate @xmath85 . at the unique steady state , if the concentration of an enzyme is large compared to the substrate , the system is well approximated by a set of mono - molecular reactions : @xmath86 our theory therefore predicts that half of the noise in michaelis - menten kinetics operating in its linear range ( abundant enzyme ) is generated by degradation of the product molecules . in figure [ michaelis ]",
    "we have calculated the contributions of each of the four reactions to the variance of all four species for the full model ( without themonomolecular approximation ) .",
    "the contribution of the output degradation is as predicted by the monomolecular approximation .",
    "the canonical example of a linear catalytic pathway is the gene expression process , which can simply be viewed as the production of rna ( @xmath73 ) from source at the rate @xmath87 , and production of protein ( @xmath88 ) in a catalytic reaction at rate @xmath89 together with first order degradation of both species at rates @xmath90 , @xmath91._proposition 1 _ states that the part of the variance resulting from the protein degradation equals half of the protein mean .",
    "moreover , formula ( [ sigma_j ] ) allows us to derive the complete decomposition @xmath92 a similar decomposition was first presented by @xcite , however , only into contributions resulting from fluctuating species and without theoretical explanation ; the latter was provided later by @xcite .",
    "below we investigate two extensions of the above model .",
    "first , we assume that the promoter can fluctuate between `` on '' and `` off '' states ( similarly to @xcite ) and calculate contributions for different time - scales of these fluctuations .",
    "second , we assume that the protein is a fluorophore that undergoes a two - step maturation process before it becomes visible ( folding and joint cyclization with oxidation ) .",
    "figure [ promoter ] presents contributions for fast and slow promoter kinetics , showing that fast fluctuations are effectively filtered out ( contributing 10 % ) but remain a substantial contributor when they are slow ( contributing 40 % ) .",
    "variability in gene expression is often measured by means of fluorescent proteins that undergo maturation before becoming visible for detection techniques ; but the process of maturation @xcite itself is subject to stochastic effects , and can thus contribute significantly to the observed variability .",
    "we used typical parameters @xcite for fast and slow maturing fluorescent proteins and found that maturation contributed 4 and 25% , respectively ( figure [ maturation ] ) to the overall variability ; here our method allows for the rigorous quantification compared to the previous qualitative observations of @xcite .      in order to demonstrate that our methodology and predictions are valid also for more general out - of - steady state models we next focus on the p53 regulatory system which incorporates a feedback loop between the tumour suppressor p53 and the oncogene mdm2 , and",
    "is involved in the regulation of cell cycle and the response to dna damage .",
    "we consider the model introduced in @xcite and later analysed in @xcite that reduces the system to three molecular species , p53 , mdm2 precursor and mdm2 , denoted here by @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the model incorporates six reactions ( @xmath95 ) , and its deterministic version can be written in the form of the following ordinary differential equations @xmath96 using equation ( [ sigma_j ] ) we calculated the contributions of all of the six reactions present in the model .",
    "results are presented in figure [ p53_contrib ] .",
    "the contributions of each reaction oscillates over an approximately constant range over the course considered here , except for the reaction of @xmath97 degradation : the contribution of the @xmath97 degradation accumulates over time .",
    "this observation is consistent with our propositions which predict for the steady - state models that the contribution of output signal degradation is significant , and generally overrides the contributions of other reactions .",
    "in @xcite the authors studied the applicability of the lna for the analysis of oscillatory models and found that the approximation fails in this type of models when long time periods are considered . in these cases",
    "the total variance diverges to infinity with time .",
    "they also decomposed the total variance into an oscillatory and a diverging part ; the diverging part corresponds to the variability in the oscillation s period .",
    "the diverging part in figure [ p53_contrib ] results from the p53 degradation , indicating that stochasticity of this reaction is responsible for the variability of the period in this system .",
    "the propositions exemplified by the above models demonstrate that the noise resulting from degradation of an output is a substantial source of variability in biochemical systems . in a general system",
    "it contributes a fraction of the variance equal to the half of the mean output .",
    "here we show how controlling the degradation can reduce this contribution .",
    "we consider a simple birth and death process , but the same mechanism is valid for general system considered in the _ proposition 1_. if births and deaths occur at the state dependent rates @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , such a system is described by @xmath100 at equilibrium , we have @xmath101 , and using formula ( [ sigma_j ] ) we can calculate that contribution of degradation is @xmath102 for @xmath103 , @xmath104 this reduces , of course , to the previously discussed case @xmath105 .",
    "nevertheless , if functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 are of hill and michaelis - menten type , respectively , then the contribution is no longer directly related to the mean and can be reduced to an arbitrary low level according to the above formula .",
    "any decrease in the contribution compared to the mean is achieved by the reduction of the variance resulting from the reduced flux through both reactions and autoregulatory control effects .",
    "recent experimental work on protein degradation _ in vitro _ provides the evidence that degradation indeed exhibits michaelis - menten type kinetics @xcite , instead of the linear first order kinetics that are usually used to model degradation .",
    "the effect of autoregulation is depicted in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the noise decomposition method introduced here allows us to investigate in detail where and how noise enters biochemical processes , is propagated through reaction systems , and affects cellular decision making processes .",
    "we have shown analytically that in a wide class of systems the signal degradation reaction contributes half of the noise in a system s output regardless of parameter values .",
    "we have also carried out numerical study for a system that never reaches steady - state and confirmed the surprisingly important role of degradation in controlling stochasticity of the p53 system , as well as in a range of generic systems biology models .",
    "quite generally , the ability to dissect noise propagation through biological systems does enable researchers better to understand the role of noise in function ( and evolution ) , and will also enable synthetic biologists to either harness or dampen the effects of noise in molecular signalling and response networks .",
    "one of the central results that we found and report here is the crucial role of degradation of the signal on the overall noise levels .",
    "the relevance of degradation has not been studied before in the context of stochastic biochemical dynamics and to our knowledge our study is the first that draws attention to the importance of degradation .",
    "this is particularly important as this may indicate new therapeutic targets : in humans and other other sequenced organisms , certainly , the repertoire of proteins involved in protein degradation , in particular ubiquitin - ligases , is as rich and diverse as the repertoire of proteins regulating their activation , the kinases ( and phosphatases ) .",
    "thus targeting the degradation of proteins appears as important to biological systems as protein activation and offers an attractive and broad range of new potential therapeutic targets .",
