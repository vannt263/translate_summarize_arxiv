    "@xcite first pointed out hints for a bimodal distribution of @xmath2 ( taken to be the time interval within which fall @xmath3 of the measured grb s intensity ) drawn for 143 events detected in the konus experiment . a bimodal structure in the distribution of durations @xmath0 ( time interval from 5% to 95% of the accumulated fluence ) in batse ( burst alert and transient source explorer , onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory , @xcite ) 1b dataset , based on which",
    "grbs are nowadays commonly classified into short ( @xmath4 ) and long ( @xmath5 ) classes , was also found @xcite.while generally short grbs are of merger origin and long ones come from collapsars , this classification is imperfect due to a large overlap in duration distributions of the two populations @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a third peak in the duration distribution , located between the short and long ones , in the batse 3b catalog , and using multivariate clustering procedures independently the same conclusion was arrived at by @xcite .",
    "the statistical existence of the intermediate class was supported @xcite with the use of batse 4b data .",
    "the evidence for a third normal component in @xmath1 was found also in _",
    "swift_/bat data @xcite .",
    "other datasets , i.e. _ rhessi _ @xcite and _ bepposax _",
    "@xcite , were both in agreement with earlier results regarding the bimodal distribution , and the detection of a third component was established on a lower , compared to batse and _ swift _ , significance level .",
    "hence , four different satellites provided hints about the existence of a third class of grbs .",
    "contrary to this , durations as observed by _",
    "integral _ have a unimodal distribution , which extends to the shortest timescales as a powerlaw @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a re - examination of the batse current catalog and _ swift _ dataset @xcite , showed that a mixture of three gaussians fits the _ swift _ data better than a two - gaussian , while in the batse case statistical tests did not support the presence of a third component or a higher maximum log - likelihood , @xmath6 ) due to more freedom given to the model to follow the data , i.e. due to introducing more free parameters .",
    "the important question is whether this improvement is statistically significant , and whether the model is justified[fn1 ] . ] .",
    "only one dataset ( batse 3b ) was truly trimodal in the sense of having three peaks ( i.e. , three local maxima ) . in the rest (",
    "i.e. , batse 4b and current , _ swift _ , _ rhessi _ and _ bepposax _ ) a three - gaussian was found to follow the observations better than a two - gaussian , but those fits yielded only two peaks , so despite statistical analyses support the presence of a third normal _ component _ , the existence of a third physical _ class _ is not confirmed and may be ascribed to @xmath1 being described by a distribution different than a mixture of gaussians , particularly a mixture of skewed distributions @xcite .",
    "latest numerous release is due to _ fermi_/gbm observations @xcite and consists of @xmath7 grbs with computed durations @xmath0 .",
    "up to date , to the best of the author s knowledge , except @xcite , only @xcite , @xcite and @xcite conducted research on a _ fermi _ subsample , consisting of 425 bursts , from the first release of the catalog .",
    "it was proposed @xcite , in the light of @xcite , who suggested that the non - symmetry of the @xmath1 distributions is due to a non - symmetric distribution of the envelope masses of the progenitors , that a mixture of skewed distributions might be phenomenologically a better model than the commonly applied mixture of standard gaussians .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine whether mixtures of various skewed distributions ( skew - normal , sinh - arcsinh and alpha - skew - normal ) describe the duration distribution better than a mixture of standard gaussians . particularly , it is verified whether two - component mixtures of skewed distributions might challenge a commonly applied three - gaussian model .",
    "if this is shown to be true , the existence of the intermediate class in the duration distribution will be questioned .",
    "because the @xmath0 distribution is detector dependent @xcite , the analysis herein is not restricted to the _ fermi _ dataset as it was in @xcite , but also the batse and _ swift _ data are examined .",
    "these three datasets have been fitted to date with a mixture of standard gaussians , but to the best of the author s knowledge no other types of distributions were applied to the observed @xmath0 distributions .",
    "it may happen that due to instrument specification a three - component distribution might be a better description for some datasets , while for others a two - component one will be sufficient @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ data ] describes the datasets , fitting method , the properties of the distributions examined , and the method of assessing the goodness of fit . in section  [ res ] the results are presented .",
    "section  [ disc ] is devoted to discussion , and section  [ conc ] gives concluding remarks . the computer algebra system mathematica^^ v10.0.2 is applied throughout this paper .",
    "the datasets from _ fermi _ , batse , and _ swift _ are considered herein .",
    "the batse current catalog consists of 2041 grbs , and the _ swift _ dataset contains 914 events .",
    "_ fermi _ observed 1596 grbs , but a dataset of 1593 grbs is used .",
    "three durations that stand out ( two shortest and one longest ) were treated as outliers and excluded due to their significant separation from the remaining durations and a possibility of a strong influence on the outcome , especially on the tails of the fitted distributions ( if the data are binned according to any well established rule ( see section  [ data2 ] ) , the bins containing these three values are separated by empty bins from the rest of the distribution ) .",
    "whereas the durations @xmath0 are approximately log - normally distributed , herein their decimal logarithms , @xmath1 s , are employed ; for simplicity they will be referred to as _ durations _ too , and whenever a phrase _ normal distribution of durations _ is used , it is understood in the sense of _ normal distribution of logarithms of durations ( @xmath1 ) _ or , equivalently , _ log - normal distribution of durations @xmath0_. this notion applies also to other distributions examined throughout this paper .",
    "the rhessi and bepposax datasets are not examined here for the following reasons : _ i _ ) rhessi has no grb trigerring and only consists of grbs observed by other satellites ; _ ii _ )",
    "rhessi is a relatively small dataset ( 427 grbs , @xcite ) ; _ iii _ ) bepposax , due to its relatively long ( @xmath8 ) short integration time @xcite , does not contain many short grbs .      two standard fitting techniques are commonly applied : @xmath9 fitting and maximum likelihood ( ml ) method . for the first ,",
    "data need to be binned , and despite various binning rules are known ( e.g. freedman - diaconis , scott , knuth etc . )",
    ", they still leave place for ambiguity , as it might happen that the fit may be statistically significant on a given significance level for a number of binnings @xcite .",
    "the ml method is not affected by this issue and is therefore applied herein . however , for display purposes , the binnings were chosen based on the knuth rule .    having a distribution with a probability density function ( pdf ) given by @xmath10 ( possibly a mixture ) , where @xmath11 is a set of @xmath12 parameters , the log - likelihood function is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the datapoints from the sample to which a distribution is fitted .",
    "the fitting is performed by searching a set of parameters @xmath15 for which the log - likelihood is maximized @xcite .",
    "when nested models are considered , the maximal value of the log - likelihood function @xmath16 increases when the number of parameters @xmath12 increases .",
    "the following distributions are considered .    a mixture of @xmath17 standard normal ( gaussian ) @xmath18 distributions : @xmath19 being described by @xmath20 free parameters : @xmath17 pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 weights @xmath23 , satysfying @xmath24 .",

    "skewness of an sn distribution is @xmath28 where @xmath29 , hence the skewness @xmath30 is solely based on the shape parameter @xmath31 , and is limited roughly to the interval @xmath32 .",
    "the mean is given by @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath34 , the sn distribution is reduced to a standard gaussian @xmath18 due to @xmath35 .    a mixture of @xmath17 sinh - arcsinh ( sas ) distributions @xcite : @xmath36^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\times\\\\ \\textcolor{white}{f^{(\\mathcal{sas})}_k(x ) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k } \\times\\beta_i \\cosh\\left[\\beta_i\\sinh^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}\\right)-\\delta_i\\right]\\times \\\\ \\textcolor{white}{f^{(\\mathcal{sas})}_k(x ) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^k } \\times\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\sinh\\left[\\beta_i\\sinh^{-1}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu_i}{\\sigma_i}\\right)-\\delta_i\\right]^2\\right ] , \\end{array } \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] being described by @xmath37 parameters .",
    "it turns out that skewness of the sas distribution increases with increasing @xmath38 , positive skewness corresponding to @xmath39 .",
    "tailweight decreases with increasing @xmath40 , @xmath41 yielding heavier tails than the normal distribution , and @xmath42 yielding lighter tails . with @xmath43 and @xmath44",

    "skewness of a sas distribution is @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46.\\ ] ] here , @xmath47 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "the mean is given by @xmath48 .    a mixture of @xmath17 alpha - skew - normal ( asn ) distributions @xcite : @xmath49 described by @xmath27 parameters .",
    "skewness of an asn distribution is @xmath50 and is limited roughly to the interval @xmath51 .",
    "the mean is given by @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath53 the distribution is unimodal , and bimodal otherwise .      if one has two fits such that @xmath54 , then twice their difference , @xmath55 , is distributed like @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the difference in the number of parameters @xcite .",
    "if a @xmath12-value associated with the value of @xmath56 does not exceed the significance level @xmath31 , one of the fits ( with higher @xmath58 ) is statistically better than the other .",
    "for instance , for a 2-g and a 3-g , @xmath59 , and despite that , according to footnote  [ fn1 ] , @xmath60 holds always , twice their difference provides a decisive @xmath12-value .",
    "it is crucial to note that it follows from the above description that this method is not suitable for situations when the model with the higher @xmath58 has fewer parameters , i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , while all of the skewed distributions considered herein contain the standard gaussian as their special case , what makes them nested models , but e.g. the sas and sn distributions are not nested , hence no direct comparison can be performed for them with this approach .    for nested as well as non - nested models , the akaike information criterion ( @xmath63 )",
    "@xcite may be applied .",
    "the @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 a preferred model is the one that minimizes @xmath63 .",
    "the formulation of @xmath63 penalizes the use of an excessive number of parameters , hence discourages overfitting .",
    "it prefers models with fewer parameters , as long as the others do not provide a substantially better fit .",
    "the expression for @xmath63 consists of two competing terms : the first measuring the model complexity ( number of free parameters ) and the second measuring the goodness of fit ( or more precisely , the lack of thereof ) . among candidate models with @xmath65 ,",
    "let @xmath66 denote the smallest .",
    "then , @xmath67 where @xmath68 , can be interpreted as the relative ( compared to @xmath66 ) probability that the @xmath69-th model minimizes the @xmath63 .",
    "what is essential in assesing the goodness of a fit in the @xmath63 method is the difference , @xmath68 , not the absolute value value contains scaling constants coming from the log - likelihood @xmath6 , and so @xmath70 are free of such constants @xcite .",
    "one might consider @xmath68 a rescaling transformation that forces the best model to have @xmath71 .",
    "] of an @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath72 , then there is substantial support for the @xmath69-th model ( or the evidence against it is worth only a bare mention ) , and the proposition that it is a proper description is highly probable . if @xmath73 , then there is strong support for the @xmath69-th model . when @xmath74 , there is considerably less support , and models with @xmath75 have essentially no support @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that when two models with similar @xmath58 are considered , the @xmath70 depends solely on the number of parameters due to the @xmath76 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . hence ,",
    "when @xmath77 , the relative improvement is due to actual improvement of the fit , not to increasing the number of parameters only .",
    "finally , @xmath63 tries to select a model that most adequately describes reality ( in the form of the data under examination ) .",
    "this means that in fact the model being a real description of the data is never considered .",
    "first , a mixture of standard gaussians given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is fitted using the ml method , i.e. maximizing @xmath6 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the mixtures range from @xmath78 to @xmath79 components .",
    "the @xmath63 is calculated by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the preferred model is the one with the lowest @xmath63 , and it follows from figure  [ fig_aicplot ] that among the gaussian models examined , a mixture of three components is the most plausible to describe the observed distribution of _ fermi _ @xmath1 .",
    "the same conclusion is drawn for the batse and _ swift _ datasets . hence , as it is expected that the other pdfs [ sn , sas and asn given by eq .",
    "( [ eq6])([eq8 ] ) ] will be more flexible in fitting the data , the forthcoming analysis is restricted to two or three components for distributions being a mixture of unimodal pdfs ( sn and sas ) , and to one , two , or three components for asn , as its one bimodal component may turn out to follow the data well enough .     vs. number of components in a mixture of standard normal distributions .",
    "the minimal value corresponds to a three - gaussian . ]",
    "data gathered by _",
    "color dashed curves are the components of the ( black solid ) mixture distribution .",
    "the panels show a mixture of ( a ) two standard gaussians , ( b ) three standard gaussians , ( c ) two skew - normal , ( d ) three skew - normal , ( e ) two sinh - arcsinh , ( f ) three sinh - arcsinh , ( g ) one alpha - skew - normal , and ( h ) two alpha - skew - normal distributions . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      and relative probability ( @xmath80 ) for the _ swift _ models . ]",
    "since @xcite , fitting a mixture of standard ( i.e. , non - skewed ) gaussians to the duration distribution of grbs is a common practice .",
    "nearly all of the catalogs examined showed that a three - gaussian fit is statistically more significant than a two - gaussian .",
    "this has been the basis of justifying the possibility of a third , intermediate in duration , class of grbs , but might be ascribed simply to a higher flexibility of the fitted pdf due to a noticeably higher number of parameters . in many works ,",
    "a model consisting of three gaussians was called a trimodal , what is incorrect , as a trimodal distribution is characterized by three modes , hence three peaks recognized through local maxima @xcite .",
    "this was the case only in the batse 3b dataset @xcite , where 797 grbs were examined .",
    "however , in batse current catalog ( @xmath81 grbs ) no such structure was detected @xcite  it appears that the peak related to an intermediate class was smeared out when more data was gathered .",
    "other catalogs , e.g. _ swift _ , also exhibit a bimodal distribution , although apparently skewed .",
    "the presumed intermediate class was proposed to be linked to x - ray flares , or are related to long grbs through some physically meaningful parameters or set of parameters @xcite .",
    "recently it was suggested @xcite that the duration distribution corresponding to the collapsar scenario ( associated to long grbs ) might not be necessary symmetric , its reason being a non - symmetric distribution of envelope masses of the progenitors .",
    "therefore , mixtures of skewed distributions were tested herein , and it was found that a 2-sn ( having the minimal @xmath63 ) and 2-sas distributions are the best candidates to describe the observed @xmath1 distribution in the _ fermi _ sample .",
    "these two models yield @xmath82 , which implies a substantial support for the 2-sas model compared to a 2-sn model @xcite , corresponding to a probability of 37.7%",
    ". nevertheless , both of these two most plausible models are a mixture of only two skewed components .",
    "the model with the third smallest @xmath63 is a 3-g with @xmath83 , which gives strong support for the model , although somewhat weaker than the preferred 2-sn and 2-sas .",
    "the corresponding likelihood of the 3-g model is 21% .",
    "the model with the fourth smallest @xmath63 is a 2-g , with @xmath84 , which means considerably less support , corresponding to a likelihood of 10.8% .",
    "other models yielded probabilities not higher than 3.6% , hence are unlikely to describe the data well .    in the case of batse and",
    "_ swift _ , the results are slightly different .",
    "the best model for describing their duration distribution is indeed a 3-g , however a strong support ( @xmath85 ) for a and a 2-sn distributions indicates that models with two skewed components can not be ruled out , although despite being of complexity comparable to the 3-g distribution ( i.e. , having one parameter more and one less than the 3-g ) , they do not introduce a third component that might be thought to come from a third class .",
    "hence , these two - component models are of simpler interpretation , especially when the possibility that the distribution of envelope masses is non - symmetric is considered . moreover , for the batse dataset , a 2-asn and a 2-g are models with the third and fourth lowest @xmath63 , with a relative probability of 21.7% and 14.6% , respectively . for _ swift _ , a 2-sas has a favorable @xmath86 , while a 2-asn yielded a relative probability of 26.2% , both being a considerable support . in all cases ,",
    "the distributions fitted are bimodal , hence the existence of a third , intermediate in duration , grb class is unlikely to be present in these catalogs , as well as in the _ fermi _ sample .",
    "it is important to note that in _ fermi _ the sensitivity at very soft and very hard grbs was higher than in batse @xcite .",
    "soft grbs are intermediate in duration , and hard grbs have short durations .",
    "hence , an increase in intermediate grbs relative to long ones might be expected as a consequence of improving instruments , yet the third class remains elusive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "_ swift _ is more sensitive in soft bands than batse was , hence its dataset has a low fraction of short grbs .",
    "therefore , the group populations inferred from _ fermi _ observations are reasonable considering the characteristics of the instruments .",
    "mixtures of various statistical distributions were fitted to the observed grb durations of _ fermi _ , batse and _ swift_. it was found , based on the akaike information criterion , that for _ fermi _ the most probable among the tested models is a two - component skew - normal distribution . the second most plausible , with a relative probability of 37.7% , is a two - component sinh - arcsinh distribution ( 2-sas ) .",
    "a three - gaussian has a relative probability of 21% of being correct .",
    "it is concluded that an elusive intermediate grb class is unlikely to be present in the _ fermi _ duration distribution , which is better described by a two - component mixture of skewed rather than symmetric distributions , hence the third class appears to be a statistical effect , and not a physical phenomenon .    for batse and _ swift _",
    "a three - gaussian was found to describe the distributions best , however due to the small @xmath87 the preference of a 3-g over a 2-sas and a 2-sn , respectively , is not strong enough to rule out the latter models .",
    "also , a considerable support is shown by a 2-asn and a 2-g in the case of batse , and a 2-sas and a 2-asn in the case of _ swift_.",
    "this corroborates the possibility of a non - existence of a third , intermediate grb class , and gives evidence that the commonly applied mixture of standard normal distributions may not be a proper model , as some skewed distributions describe the data at least as well ( batse and _ swift _ ) , or considerably better ( _ fermi _ ) .",
