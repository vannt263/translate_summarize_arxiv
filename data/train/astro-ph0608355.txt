    "[ sec : introduction ] a striking property of the extrasolar planets known to date is the range of their orbital eccentricities , which is far wider than that of planets in the solar system .",
    "eccentricities are typically @xmath19@xmath20 , but very low and high values are also found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a variety of explanations have been proposed to explain the eccentricities .",
    "the high eccentricity cases may owe their explanation to the presence of a distant binary companion @xcite .",
    "in fact , the large eccentricity ( @xmath21 ) of hd  80606b could be the result of a three - body interaction process , known as `` kozai cycle '' @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerical experiments show that the observed distribution of orbital eccentricities for @xmath22 can be reproduced by assuming the action of a kozai - type perturbation @xcite .    for more typical eccentricities ,",
    "other processes are likely to be at work .",
    "planet - planet interactions involving scattering on dynamical timescales is a possibility @xcite .",
    "however , numerical experiments indicate that interactions between equal mass planets would produce more isolated planets on low - eccentricity orbits than those observed @xcite . secular interactions between planets is another possible means of eccentricity excitation @xcite .",
    "this mechanism assumes that the planets have appropriate initial separations for evolution to occur on secular timescales ( @xmath23 years ) .",
    "disk - planet interactions can also give rise to planetary eccentricities @xcite .",
    "the evolution of orbital eccentricity depends on a delicate balance between lindblad and corotation resonances .",
    "if the planet is massive enough to clear a gap , lindblad resonances promote eccentricity growth , while corotation resonances damp eccentricity .",
    "if the corotation resonances operate at maximal efficiency , they dominate over lindblad resonances by a slight margin , and the result is eccentricity damping @xcite .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed to weaken the effects of corotation resonances and thereby provide eccentricity growth .",
    "the first mechanism relies on a large enough gap about a planet s orbit to exclude the corotation resonances from the disk , while leaving a remaining lindblad resonance , the 1:3 outer resonance .",
    "this mechanism requires a massive enough companion and/or low enough viscosity to open a wide enough gap .",
    "such a mechanism has been demonstrated for binary stars @xcite .",
    "the second mechanism relies on the delicate nature of corotational resonances in their ability to weaken ( saturate ) when the disk viscosity is sufficiently small and the planet eccentricity sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "a small finite initial eccentricity , typically @xmath24 , is required for the eccentricity to grow by this mechanism . moreover ,",
    "a companion object on a circular orbit can drive eccentricity in a circumstellar disk .",
    "this process is believed to occur in disks involving @xmath25@xmath26 jupiter - mass ( @xmath2 ) companions @xcite and binary stars @xcite .",
    "the disk transfers eccentricity to the planet s orbit by exchanging energy and angular momentum .",
    "the disk - planet system undergoes a coupled eccentricity evolution .",
    "one goal of this paper is to determine whether the eccentricity growth by disk - planet interactions occurs .",
    "simulations by @xcite suggested that orbital eccentricity is excited when the mass of the embedded body is larger than about @xmath25@xmath26 jupiter - masses , while lower mass companions experienced eccentricity damping . by applying higher resolution and simulating over longer timescales",
    ", we aim to see whether eccentricity growth can occur for lower mass , planetary mass , companions .",
    "in addition , we are interested in the effects of eccentricity on planet migration .",
    "accretion of gas onto a planet is likely affected by the planet s orbit eccentricity .",
    "circumbinary disks surrounding eccentric orbit binaries undergo pulsed accretion on orbital timescales @xcite .",
    "a similar process could occur with eccentric orbit planets .",
    "the mean accretion rate could also be modified by the orbital eccentricity .",
    "another goal of this paper is to investigate this accretion process .",
    "g. dangelo , s. lubow , & m. bate we apply high - resolution hydrodynamical simulations to investigate disk - planet interactions over several thousand orbital periods . in section  [ sec : model_description ] we describe the physical model .",
    "the numerical aspects of the calculations are detailed in section  [ sec : numerical_issues ] .",
    "results on the growth of the disk eccentricity for a fixed planet orbit are presented in section  [ sec : disk_eccentricity ] .",
    "similar results on the growth of disk eccentricity were recently reported by @xcite .",
    "we describe results on the planet s orbital evolution in section  [ sec : orbital_evolution ] .",
    "results on the pulsed accretion are described in section  [ sec : planet_accretion ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "we assume that the disk matter and planet are in coplanar orbits . in order to describe the dynamical interactions between a circumstellar disk and a giant planet , we approximate the disk as being two - dimensional , by ignoring dynamical effects in the direction perpendicular to the orbit plane ( vertical direction ) .",
    "this approximation is justified by the fact that the disk thickness is smaller than the vertical extent of the planetary roche lobes for the cases we consider .",
    "comparisons between two- and three - dimensional models of jupiter - mass planets embedded in a disk indicate that the two - dimensional geometry provides a sufficiently reliable description of the system @xcite .",
    "we employ a cylindrical coordinate frame @xmath27 in which the disk lies in the plane @xmath28 and the origin , @xmath29 , is located on the primary .",
    "the reference frame rotates about the disk axis ( i.e. , the @xmath30-axis ) with an angular velocity @xmath31 and an angular acceleration @xmath32 .",
    "the set of continuity and momentum equations , describing the evolution of the disk , is written in a conservative form ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is solved for the surface density , @xmath33 , and the velocity field of the fluid , @xmath34 .",
    "the turbulent viscosity forces in the disk are assumed to arise from a standard viscous stress tensor for a newtonian fluid with a constant kinematic viscosity , @xmath35 , and a zero bulk viscosity .",
    "a locally isothermal equation of state is adopted by requiring that the vertically integrated pressure is equal to @xmath36 and that the sound speed , @xmath37 , is equal to the disk aspect ratio , @xmath38 , times the keplerian velocity . in this study",
    ", we use a constant aspect ratio throughout the disk .",
    "the gravitational potential of the disk , @xmath39 , is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass of the central star whereas @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mass and the vector position of the planet , respectively .",
    "the length @xmath44 represents a softening length that is needed to avoid singularities in the gravitational potential of the planet .",
    "the third term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : phi ] ) accounts for the acceleration of the origin of the ( non - inertial ) coordinate frame caused by the planet .",
    "we ignore disk self - gravity .",
    "for the disks we consider , the toomre-@xmath45 parameter never drops below @xmath46 during the simulations .",
    "the orbit of the planet evolves under the gravitational forces exerted by the central star and the disk material .",
    "non - inertial forces arising from the rotation of the reference frame also need to be taken into account .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion of the planet reads @xmath47 where the angular velocity and acceleration vectors of the rotating frame are defined as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . the second , third , and fourth terms on the right - hand side of the equation are the centrifugal , coriolis , and angular accelerations , respectively .",
    "the angular velocity of the reference frame relative to a fixed frame , @xmath50 , is chosen so as to compensate for the azimuthal motion of the planet .",
    "details of how this is achieved can be found in @xcite . since the azimuthal position of the planet is constant , a circular orbit reduces to a fixed point in the rotating frame . for a planet orbit with @xmath51 , the planet radially",
    "oscillates between the pericenter distance , @xmath52 , and the apocenter distance , @xmath53 . in this frame",
    ", the trajectory is a straight line of length @xmath54 with center at @xmath55 .",
    "this scheme has the advantage that the planet does not drift across the grid in the azimuthal direction .",
    "it always maintains a symmetric azimuthal position with respect to the zone centers ( where eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : phi ] ] , [ [ eq : a2 ] ] , and [ [ eq : a1 ] ] are evaluated ) while it moves radially .",
    "this method helps reduce artificially unbalanced forces that act on the protoplanet ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the last two terms in equation  ( [ eq : pme ] ) , which represent the forces per unit mass exerted by the disk material on the planet and the star , are @xmath56 and @xmath57 these two vectors are included in equation  ( [ eq : pme ] ) only when the disk back - reaction is accounted for and the protoplanet is allowed to adjust its trajectory in response to the disk torques . when these terms are applied , the integration in equations  ( [ eq : a2 ] ) and ( [ eq : a1 ] ) is performed over the disk mass comprised in the simulated domain , @xmath58 .      in these calculations ,",

    "the unit of time , @xmath60 , is defined such that @xmath61 .",
    "when we refer to the `` orbital period '' or `` orbit '' as length of time , we actually mean the initial orbital period @xmath62 .",
    "to provide estimates of various quantities in physical units , we adopt @xmath63 and @xmath64 , thus one orbit is @xmath65 years .    in order to treat the strong perturbations induced by giant protoplanets and limit the influence of the imposed radial boundaries , we considered an extended disk whose radial borders are at @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the disk extends over the entire @xmath68 radians in azimuth around the star . in physical units ,",
    "the disk models cover a region from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "the mass of the disk , in the absence of the planet , is @xmath71 within the radial limits of the simulated region .",

    "the unperturbed initial surface density is axisymmetric and scales as @xmath73 , which produces an unperturbed density , at @xmath74 , equal to @xmath75 .",
    "however , given the large planetary masses considered in this investigation , we also included an initial gap along the orbit of the planet that accounts for an approximate balance between viscous and tidal torques ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the initial gap profile is based on equation  ( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "the initial gap width is modified by a factor of @xmath76 , in order to account for the planet s initial orbital eccentricity , @xmath77 .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to study this balance , it is necessary to resolve the width of all the resonances involved in the process .",
    "the locations of first order eccentric lindblad resonances reside in a region that ranges radially from approximately @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , calculations on the saturation of isolated noncoorbital corotation resonances , performed by @xcite , suggest that a minimum resolution requirement to avoid spurious damping of eccentricity is that @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the azimuthal wavenumber and @xmath112 are coefficients of order unity given in @xcite .",
    "although nested grids provide a linear resolution @xmath113 in a region @xmath114 , the effects of these corotational resonances are not localized in azimuth , so the nested grids do not substantially improve their overall resolution . calculations that follow the orbital evolution of the planet were executed with grid systems gs1 and gs2 ( see table  [ tbl : grids ] for a description of all grid systems employed in this study ) . according to equation  ( [ eq : minres ] ) , the global radial resolution we apply @xmath115 could produce spurious damping in the outer disk for orbital eccentricities @xmath116 , with @xmath117 .",

    "although @xmath136 is much larger than the apocenter radii of the planets in the simulations , wave reflection was observed at the outer border in this case , especially when the planet orbit was eccentric .    in order to lessen the amount of wave reflection at the outer disk edge",

    "the flow is assumed to be keplerian around the central star .",
    "this choice could lead to some small - amplitude wave excitation at @xmath135 , since the fluid tends to orbit about the center - of - mass of the system , rather than around the central star ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig : globalsigma ] shows that the size of the truncation radius increases with planet mass and eccentricity , analogous to the case for circumbinary disks @xcite .",
    "in addition , a wave or wake propagates in the outer disk . the disk truncation also be seen in figure  [ fig : avsigma ] , which shows the azimuthally averaged surface density for various cases .",
    "the outer gap edge becomes less steep as the orbital eccentricity increases and does not change significantly over an orbital period , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : gapedge_inertial ] .",
    "after a few hundred orbits , the disk region near the planet becomes eccentric , even if the planet is on a circular orbit .",

    "the growth rate of the mass - weighted eccentricity is then @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the mass of the eccentric region and the sum is taken over the active eccentric lindblad resonances , and @xmath199 due to torque cut - off effects @xcite .",
    "the contribution of each resonance in the above sum for @xmath200 for a @xmath6 planet is shown in figure  [ fig : lam ] .",
    "we consider times beyond several hundred orbits , when the width of the eccentric region @xmath183 @xmath201 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lam ] shows that there is a weak contribution from the outermost resonance , the 1:3 resonance , corresponding to @xmath177 .",
    "even though the density at this resonance is the largest , a nearly complete cancellation occurs in @xmath202 , due to effects of the indirect term in potential @xmath203 .",
    "if only the @xmath177 resonance were involved , then the eccentricity growth timescale would be very long , @xmath204 orbits .",
    "the growth rate contributions from regions closer to the planet are weakened by the lower density , but strengthened by the larger values of @xmath205 . at a time of 500 orbits ,",
    "the density near the planet is small enough that the outermost resonances ( @xmath206 ) provide most of the growth rate . at a time of 500 orbits ,",

    "this requires a slightly different definition of @xmath158 than given by equation  ( [ eq : modemkl ] ) .",
    "when we apply that definition , we obtain eccentric disk evolution in the @xmath6 case that is similar to the @xmath209 results in figure  [ fig : s10_vs_t ] , except that the magnitude of @xmath158 in the innermost region is about a factor of 8 smaller .",
    "the average growth rate of @xmath158 in the innermost region is about the same over @xmath95 orbits .",
    "] at earlier times , the growth rate is higher because @xmath183 is smaller . we conclude that the disk eccentricity growth is possible over @xmath175 orbits in the case of planets because of contributions from several resonances that lie in the disk edge / gap region .",
    "this situation differs from the superhump binary case where only a single resonance is involved , since the disk extends relatively closer to the perturber in the planet case , due to its weaker tidal barrier .",
    "increased viscosity affects the disk eccentricity in multiple ways .",
    "it leads to further disk penetration of the planet s tidal barrier , which could lead to stronger eccentricity growth .",
    "on the other hand , viscosity also acts to unsaturate ( or strengthen ) the corotation resonances which act to damp eccentricity .",
    "furthermore , the viscosity acts to damp the non - circular motions associated with the eccentricity .",
    "at time @xmath94 ( between @xmath95@xmath96 orbits ) the planet was allowed to adjust its orbit in response to the gravitational forces exerted by the surrounding disk material .",
    "we generally neglected torques on the planet due to gas within a distance of @xmath210 from the planet .",
    "however , analyses of the torque distribution at the release time indicate that torques within the roche lobe do not dominate the orbital evolution of the planet .",
    "so we believe this procedure does not likely lead to major errors in the planet s orbital evolution .",
    "all calculations presented in this section employed grid gs2 , except for the @xmath6 cases on initially circular orbits ( @xmath211 ) , which employed grid gs1 . in order to analyze the orbital evolution of the planet after release , we calculated the osculating elements of the orbit each few hydrodynamics time - steps ( approximately every @xmath11 orbits ) . to remove short - period oscillations , we computed the mean orbital elements @xcite by using an averaging period of one orbit . throughout the paper ,",
    "the planetary orbital eccentricities and semi - major axes in the simulations refer to the mean orbital elements .",
    "simulations by @xcite showed that the interaction between an initially circular disk and a circular orbit planet with mass @xmath212 can lead to the growth of disk eccentricity and planetary orbital eccentricity .",

    "the average growth timescale is shorter than the standard type  ii migration ( or viscous diffusion ) timescale ( see   [ sec : radial_migration ] ) . over the last @xmath95 orbits of the simulation , the eccentricity of the @xmath6 planet increases very slowly , at a rate @xmath219 .    the model with @xmath137 and initial zero - eccentricity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : et_mp1vse ] , dashed line ) shows a much slower orbital eccentricity growth , reaching @xmath220 after @xmath8 orbits from the release time .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : eccentricity_growth ] , the eccentric perturbation induced by the planet on the disk is also rather weak compared to that excited by the @xmath5 planet . at the average growth rate @xmath221 , it would take on the order of the viscous diffusion timescale to reach @xmath222 .    in order to evaluate to the extent of orbital eccentricity growth , we used configurations with fixed non - zero planet eccentricities prior to release , @xmath77 .",
    "figure  [ fig : et_mp1vse ] also shows the orbital eccentricity evolution of a @xmath137 planet with @xmath223 . after release , @xmath141 oscillates about the initial value .",

    ", @xmath225 is of order the viscous diffusion timescale .",
    "we simulated several models with @xmath226 ( not plotted ) and found that there was generally a reduction of the orbital eccentricity , with some exceptions though .",
    "for example , in a model with a @xmath9 planet and @xmath227 , @xmath141 underwent small amplitude oscillations about the initial value , with periods of a few hundred orbits .",

    "radial migration of planets in the mass range considered in this study is expected to be in the standard type  ii regime , which is characterized by an orbital decay timescale @xmath229 @xcite .",
    "the type  ii migration rate depends only on the viscous timescale of the disk near the location of the planet and is independent of the disk density , provided the disk is locally more massive than the planet .",

    "the figure shows that the initial migration rate depends on the planet s mass , which is inconsistent with the type  ii prediction .",

    "we used the torque density per unit mass given in equation  ( 4 ) of @xcite .",
    "we checked that the results are insensitive to the details of the torque density , provided that it is large enough to produce a gap .",

    "we adopted the same disk and planet parameters as in the two - dimensional simulations with zero planet eccentricity . in short ,",
    "we find that the largest contributing factor to this non - type  ii behavior is the lack of a substantial inner disk in the two - dimensional calculations .",
    "there is also some effect due to the non - zero planet - to - disk mass ratio .",
    "a comparison of orbital migration between one - dimensional and two - dimensional models is shown in figure  [ fig : at_1dvs2d ] . in this comparison",
    "we used the azimuthal averaged surface density distributions in figure  [ fig : avsigma ] as initial conditions for the one - dimensional models .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : at_1dvs2d ] , the one - dimensional ( zero eccentricity ) migration rates , for a very low density inner disk , agree well with the two - dimensional rates at early times after release , while the planet eccentricity is small . for undepleted initial inner disks , we find that one - dimensional models have about the same migration rates for these two planet masses .",
    "it is possible that the two - dimensional simulations have an inner boundary @xmath232 that is too large to resolve the inner disk .",

    "as a planet s orbital eccentricity grows toward values of about @xmath233 , the rate of migration slows significantly ( see fig .  [",

    "the @xmath6 planet exhibits a migration speed @xmath234 per orbit , with a tendency towards further reduction .",

    "there is a clear trend towards slower migration rates for larger orbital eccentricities . in particular , when @xmath241 , the direction of migration is reversed . in all the calculations that show outward migration , the angular momentum of the eccentric orbit planet increases in time .",
    "we have conducted some preliminary investigations on the cause of this outward torque .",
    "one possibility is that it is due to the outer disk , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "when the planet eccentricity is large enough , the angular motion of the planet at apocenter can be slower than that of the inner parts of the outer disk , resulting in form of dynamical friction that increases the angular momentum of the planet .",
    "for the situation we wish to consider , it is not clear how the outer disk inner edge is maintained , when this model is applied .",
    "this disk material loses angular momentum from viscous torques and gains angular momentum from the planet , in the usual torque balance for a gap .",
    "the latter implies that the planet should lose , rather than gain , angular momentum .",
    "a preliminary analysis suggests that the outward torque may arise in the coorbital region .",

    "planet eccentricities of @xmath314 were found in the simulations over the course of a few thousand orbits for @xmath315 and @xmath312 planets .",
    "a similar eccentricity growth is obtained for a @xmath316 planet in a disk with viscosity @xmath317 .",
    "the planet and disk both acquire eccentricity as they interact , which may lead to complicated time - dependent behavior of their eccentricities .",
    "the planet eccentricity growth is likely aided by the disk eccentricity growth .",
    "the results suggest that the eccentric growth found for @xmath318 planets by @xcite also occurs for lower planet masses .",
    "the higher resolution achieved by our calculations may be playing a role in obtaining this growth .",
    "for circular orbit planets , migration occurs on roughly the local viscous timescale , as expected for type  ii migration .",
    "however , it is slowed for eccentric orbit planets .",
    "this result appears for several configurations with either dynamically determined ( fig .",
    "[ fig : at_mp123 ] and [ fig : eat_mp3vsnu ] ) or imposed planet eccentricities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : at_mpvse ] ) . for a @xmath5 case , even migration reversal ( outward migration )",
    "is found for a dynamically determined eccentricity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : at_mp123 ] ) .",
    "migration slowing or reversal would have important consequences for the planet formation process .",
    "the cause is not yet clear .",
    "it may involve torques from outer disk @xcite or instead from the coorbital region .",
    "some preliminary evidence suggests the latter .",
    "mass accretion both within a planet s roche lobe and through a gap can be strongly modulated with orbital phase for eccentric orbit planets or eccentric disks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avmpdot ] , [ fig : density_zoom ] , and [ fig : avmsdot ] ) .",
    "the modulation was largest for planet eccentricity @xmath319 .",
    "this pulsating accretion is similar to what is found for eccentric orbit binary stars embedded in a circumbinary disk @xcite , although the phasing is different .",
    "both disk and planet eccentricity also lead to enhanced accretion onto the planet .",
    "this enhancement likely helps planets achieve higher masses .",
    "the simulations lend support to the idea that disk - planet interactions cause planet eccentricity growth , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the simulations suggest that planet eccentricities are easier to achieve for higher mass planets ( @xmath320 ) .",
    "our results are subject to the usual limitations in approximate initial conditions , simulation time , radial range for coverage of the disk ( likely resulting in the lack of an inner disk ) , the @xmath81-disk model , and the use of various numerical devices .",
    "we also neglected disk self - gravity , which may affect migration especially for higher mass disks @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear that typical extra - solar planet eccentricities of @xmath287@xmath20 can be achieved through disk - planet interactions .",
    "the eccentricity growth at later times shows indications of slowing and possibly stalling for @xmath321 ( see fig  [ fig : eat_mp3vsnu ] . )",
    "perhaps higher eccentricities can be achieved for disks with different properties ( e.g. , lower viscosity and smaller disk s aspect ratio ) .",
    "eccentricity may be limited by damping due to high order eccentric inner lindblad resonances that lie outside a planet s orbit .",
    "simulations of eccentric orbit binary star systems suggest that little eccentricity growth occurs for @xmath322 @xcite .",
    "although the simulated planets do not achieve orbital eccentricities in excess of @xmath170 over the duration of the simulated evolution ( for configurations that start from circular orbits ) , the simulation times correspond to less than @xmath323 years .",
    "migration slowing and reversal may permit the planets to achieve higher eccentricities on longer timescales while avoiding orbit decay into the disk center / host star .",
    "we have not yet investigated eccentricity evolution of sub - jupiter mass planets .",
    "they may also provide important constraints .",
    "other simulations suggest that disks with standard viscosity have only mild gaps for smaller planet masses of @xmath324 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under those conditions , disk - planet interactions likely lead to eccentricity damping , due to the dominance of the coorbital lindblad resonance @xcite .",
    "the observational determination of eccentricities for small mass planets would help constrain these models .",
    "the planet around hd  49674 is close to this regime .",
    "it has a minimum mass of @xmath325 and a best - fit eccentricity of @xmath326 ( p.  butler , private communication ) .",
    "since it is close to the central star ( the period is @xmath327 days ) , it is possible that the eccentricity evolution could be more complicated , especially if it became trapped in a central disk hole .",
    "examples of isolated planets like this , but at longer periods would provide useful constraints .",
