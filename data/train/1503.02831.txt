    "free - space optical ( fso ) communication systems have recently attracted great attention within the research community as well as for commercial use .",
    "fso systems can provide ultra - high data rates ( at the order of multiple gigabits per second ) , immunity to electromagnetic interference , excellent security and large unlicensed bandwidth i.e. hundred and thousand times higher than radio - frequency ( rf ) systems , along with low installation and operational cost @xcite .",
    "the challenge in employing such systems is that fso links are highly vulnerable due to the detrimental effects of attenuation under adverse weather conditions ( e.g. fog ) , pointing errors and atmospheric turbulence .",
    "one method to improve the reliability of the fso link is to employ spatial diversity , i.e. multiple - lasers and multiple - apertures to create a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) optical channel .",
    "because of its low complexity , spatial diversity is a particularly attractive fading mitigation technique and performance enhancements have been extensively studied in many past research works in the field of fso communications @xcite .    in order to evaluate the impact of atmospheric turbulence on the performance of osm , accurate models for the fading distribution are necessary .",
    "for example the lognormal distribution is often used to model weak turbulence conditions whereas the negative exponential and the k - distribution are used to model strong turbulence conditions @xcite .",
    "other more general statistical models have also been proposed to model scintillation over all turbulence conditions , including the gamma - gamma @xcite , the lognormal - rice ( or beckmann ) @xcite the homodyned k distribution ( h - k ) @xcite and the i - k @xcite distributions .",
    "all these three models are based on the argument that scintillation is a doubly stochastic random process modelling both small and large scale turbulence effects .",
    "besides , they agree well with measurement data and simulations for a wide range of turbulence conditions .    in this paper , the h - k distribution is adopted to model turbulence - induced fading .",
    "the main reason for this choice is the fact that this distribution is based on a very general scattering model which is valid for a wide range of atmospheric conditions .",
    "it is also noted that the h - k distribution generalizes existing models such as the k - distribution .",
    "the h - k distribution models the field of the optical wave as the sum of a deterministic component and a random component , the intensity of which follows the rice ( nakagami-@xmath0 ) distribution .",
    "the average intensity of the random portion of the field is treated as a fluctuating quantity @xcite .",
    "it is important to underline that , to the best of our knowledge , in the open technical literature there have been no papers published analyzing and evaluating the performance of fso systems over such channels , because of the complicated mathematical form of their respective probability density functions ( pdf ) .",
    "depending on their detection , fso systems can be classified into two main categories , namely coherent ( heterodyne detection ) and non - coherent ( direct detection ) systems .",
    "coherent fso systems have the information bits encoded directly onto the electric field of the optical beam . at the receiver , a local oscillator ( lo )",
    "is employed to extract the information encoded on the optical carrier electric field . on the one hand",
    ", coherent fso systems can provide significant performance enhancements due to spatial temporal selectivity and heterodyne gain in comparison to direct detection systems .",
    "moreover , they are more versatile as any kind of amplitude , frequency , or phase modulation can be employed . on the other hand ,",
    "coherent receivers are more difficult to implement as the lo field should be spatially and temporally coherent with the received field .",
    "recently , the so - called optical spatial modulation ( osm ) has emerged as a power- and bandwidth - efficient single - carrier transmission technique for optical wireless communication systems @xcite .",
    "this spatial diversity scheme , initially proposed in @xcite and further investigated in @xcite , employs a simple modulation mechanism that foresees to activate just one out of several mimo transmitters at any time instant and to use the index of the activated transmitter as an additional dimension for conveying implicit information .",
    "it has been shown that osm can increase the data rate by base two logarithm of the number of transmit units @xcite .",
    "also , osm can increase the data rate by by a factor of 2 and 4 , respectively , as compared to on - off keying ( ook ) and pulse position modulation ( ppm ) @xcite .",
    "it is underlined that such performance gains are obtained with a significant reduction in receiver complexity and system design . because of the above mentioned advantages of osm over other more conventional transmission schemes and given the wide applicability of fso , it is of interest to investigate the potential performance enhancements obtained by incorporating osm in fso systems . however , in general this research topic has not been dealt within our research community .",
    "only recently , there have been papers published in the open technical literature dealing with performance analysis studies of fso systems employing spatial modulation and operating in the presence of atmospheric turbulence , e.g. see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "specifically , in @xcite , the combination of subcarrier intensity modulation and spatial modulation with receiver diversity was proposed to enhance the performance of intensity modulated direct detection ( im / dd ) fso systems . in @xcite ,",
    "another im / dd based system fso system which combines antenna shift keying with joint pulse position and amplitude modulations was considered .",
    "for this system , which was denoted as spatial pulse position and amplitude modulation ( sppam ) , the atmospheric turbulence channel was modeled as log - normal or gamma - gamma distributions and was evaluated , in terms of bounds , for uncoded and coded signals .",
    "abep performance evaluation results have shown that sppam offers a compromise between spectral and power efficiencies as well as a certain degree of robustness against atmospheric turbulence . despite these two papers which deal with non - coherent detection schemes ,",
    "the potential enhancements of osm on the performance of fso systems with coherent detection still remains an open research topic which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been addressed so far in the open technical literature .    motivated by the above , in this paper we present for the first time a generic analytical framework which can be used to accurately obtain the performance of outdoor osm with coherent detection in the presence of turbulence - induced fading .",
    "more specifically and within this novel analytical framework , the main novel research contributions of the paper are as follows :    * new analytical expressions for the abep of coherent osm under turbulence conditions modeled by the h - k distribution are derived . when the transmitter is equipped with two apertures the resulting analytical expressions are exact , whereas for an arbitrary number of transmit apertures tight upper  bounds can be obtained . *",
    "error probability performance bounds for coded osm systems are derived and the performance enhancements when channel coding is employed are presented and analyzed .    the error probability performance of osm is also compared to that of conventional fso schemes with transmit or receive diversity only , i.e. when maximal ratio combining ( mrc ) , selection combining ( sc ) or alamouti - type space - time block codes ( stbc ) are employed .",
    "it is noted that the theoretical analysis is substantiated by comparing the theoretical and equivalent simulated performance evaluation results obtained by means of monte carlo techniques .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , section  [ sec : model ] outlines the system and channel models . in section  [ sec : abep_analysis ]",
    "analytical expressions for the abep of uncoded osm systems are presented .",
    "asymptotic abep expressions are also derived , wherefrom the diversity gain of coherent osm can be readily deduced .",
    "the performance of coded osm systems is discussed in section  [ sec : coded ] . in section  [ sec : results ] the various performance evaluation results and their interpretations as well as comparisons are presented . finally , concluding remarks can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . _",
    "notations : _ a comprehensive list of all mathematical notations used in this paper can be found in table  [ tab : notations ] .",
    "in this section , a detailed description of the osm fso system model , i.e. transmitter , channel and receiver is provided . moreover , the h - k distribution is introduced and analytical expressions for its parameters in terms of equivalent physical parameters of the turbulence phenomenon , such as the refractive - index structure parameter , optical wave number , and propagation path length , are derived .",
    "let us consider a @xmath1 mimo fso system with @xmath2 transmit units ( lasers ) and @xmath3 coherent receivers .",
    "it is assumed that the receiving apertures are separated by more than a coherence wavelength to ensure the independency of fading channels .",
    "the basic principle of osm modulation is as follows @xcite :    \\i ) the transmitter encodes blocks of @xmath4 data bits into the index of a single transmit unit",
    ". such a block of bits is hereafter referred to as  message \" and is denoted by @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that the @xmath2 messages are transmitted with equal probability by the encoder and that the related transmitted signal is denoted by @xmath7 . during each time slot , only one transmitter @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is active for data transmission .",
    "the information bits are modulated on the electric field of an optical signal beam through an external modulator . during this particular time slot ,",
    "the remaining transmit lasers are kept silent , i.e. they do not transmit .",
    "\\ii ) at the receiver , the incoming optical field is mixed with a local oscillator ( lo ) field and the combined wave is first converted by the photodetector to an electrical one .",
    "a bandpass filter is then employed to extract the intermediate frequency ( if ) component of the total output current .",
    "finally , a @xmath3-hypothesis detection problem is solved to retrieve the active transmit unit index , which results in the estimation of the unique sequence of bits emitted by the transmitter .",
    "the received electric field at the aperture plane of the @xmath0-th receiver after mixing with a lo beam , can be expressed as @xcite @xmath10 in the above equation , @xmath11 is the transmit laser power , @xmath12 is the free space impedance , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the magnitude and the phase of the complex channel coefficient between the @xmath15-th transmit and the @xmath0-th receive aperture , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 denotes the power of the local oscillator , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the carrier and the intermediate radian frequencies , respectively .",
    "the output current of the @xmath0-th photodetector can be mathematically expressed as @xcite @xmath20 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the responsivity of the photodetector with @xmath22cb is the charge of an electron , @xmath23 is the planck constant , @xmath24 is the photodetector efficiency , and @xmath25 is the optical center frequency . expanding and ignoring the double - frequency terms that are filtered out by the bandpass filter , the resulting photocurrent can be expressed as @xmath26 in , @xmath27 is the dc component generated by the signal and local oscillator fields , respectively , @xmath28 is the ac component in the received photocurrent which , unlike for direct detection , contains information about the frequency and phase of the received signal .",
    "it is assumed that for coherent detection the intermediate frequency @xmath19 is nonzero , so that the signal power can be expressed as @xmath29    as in @xcite , we also consider that @xmath30 and thus , the dc photocurrent can be approximated as @xmath31 .",
    "the photodetection process is impaired by shot noise with variance @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the electrical bandwidth of the photodetector .",
    "it is also noted that because of the large value of @xmath34 the photocurrent due to thermal noise and the dark current can be ignored @xcite .    following @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the sufficient statistics at the @xmath0-th coherent receiver can be expressed as @xmath35 + z_{n}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and @xmath37 is the noise at the @xmath0-th receiver . assuming that the lo power is large and the receiver noise is dominated by lo related noise terms , the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) model can be employed as an accurate approximation of the poisson photon - counting detection model @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath38 can be modeled as a zero - mean unit variance complex gaussian random variable @xcite .",
    "similar to @xcite , it is assumed that the receiver has knowledge of the actual fading gains and that the total fading remains constant over one bit interval and changes from one interval to another in an independent manner . at the receiver ,",
    "the optimal spatial modulation detector estimates the active transmitter index , @xmath8 , at a given time slot according to @xcite @xmath39 where    * @xmath40 is an @xmath2-dimensional vector with elements corresponding to the electrical field @xmath41 that is transmitted over the optical mimo channel ; * @xmath42 is an @xmath43 optical mimo channel defined as @xmath44 \\\\ & \\triangleq \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } { { h}}_{11}(t)\\exp(\\jmath\\phi_{11 } )   & \\ldots & { { h}}_{1m}(t)\\exp(\\jmath\\phi_{1m})\\\\ { { h}}_{21}(t)\\exp(\\jmath\\phi_{21 } )   & \\ldots & { { h}}_{2m}(t)\\exp(\\jmath\\phi_{2m})\\\\ \\vdots   & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ { { h}}_{n1}(t)\\exp(\\jmath\\phi_{n1 } )   & \\ldots & { { h}}_{nm}(t)\\exp(\\jmath\\phi_{nm } ) \\end{array } \\right]\\ ; \\end{split}\\ ] ] * @xmath45 is the @xmath3-dimensional noise vector ; * @xmath46 is the pdf of @xmath47 conditioned on the transmitted vector @xmath40 and the channel @xmath48 ;      a discrete scattering model is considered , where the radiation field of an optical wave at a particular point is assumed to be composed of a number of scattered components that have traveled different paths . under the ricean assumption @xcite , the complex channel path gains @xmath49 between the @xmath50-th transmitter and the @xmath51-th photodetector can be expressed as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the radian frequency of the optical wave and @xmath54+r_{ij}(t)\\exp[\\jmath \\phi_{ij}(t ) ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the term @xmath55 is a deterministic component and @xmath56 is a circular complex gaussian random variable .",

    "the parameters of the h - k distribution are calculated from and assuming spherical wave propagation .",
    "following @xcite , it is further assumed that the operating wavelength is @xmath205 nm and @xmath206 .",
    "as expected , the error performance deteriorates as @xmath189 increases from @xmath207 m to @xmath208 m .",
    "moreover , it is evident that an increase in @xmath189 from 500 m to 1000 m results in a more severe performance deterioration than in the case where @xmath189 increases from 1000 m to 1500 m . in all cases",
    "considered , the analytical results obtained using are compared with the equivalent results obtained by means of monte - carlo computer simulations and again match very well .",
    "next we compare the proposed osm system with two alternative coherent fso systems that can provide performance enhancements by means of transmit ( miso ) or receive diversity ( simo ) .",
    "it is noted that for similar aperture configurations , a fair comparison between coherent and im / dd systems seems difficult as the same received laser power leads to different snrs for each of these schemes @xcite . on the other hand , in order to perform a fair comparison between osm and the alternative miso or simo systems under the same propagation channel conditions , the aperture configuration of the fso systems under comparison should be selected carefully .",
    "specifically , because of the fact that the diversity gain of osm equals to only the number of the receive apertures only , i.e. no transmit diversity gain is provided , the number of transmit or receive apertures of the alternative systems must be hence selected to be equal to the number of receive apertures of the osm system . to this end , for a fair comparison in our paper a @xmath209 osm system is compared with the following two alternative fso communication systems which also employ coherent detection : i ) a @xmath192 heterodyne fso communication system which employs differential phase shift keying @xcite and mrc or sc .",
    "\\ii ) a @xmath199 coherent fso system employing the alamouti scheme @xcite and binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) .",
    "the instantaneous snr at the output of the coherent mrc receiver assuming equal average snr per receiving aperture , @xmath181 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath210 whereas for sc is @xmath211 for mrc case , the abep can be deduced as @xcite @xmath212 for sc case , an analytical expression for the abep is more difficult to be deduced and , therefore , abep will be evaluated by means of monte carlo simulation only .",
    "as far as the alamouti scheme is concerned , the instantaneous snr at the input of the demodulator of the optical receiver has a similar form as @xcite . for this scheme ,",
    "the abep of bpsk can be evaluated as @xmath213 in order to simplify the underlying mathematical analysis , it is assumed that the pdf of @xmath214 is given by with the parameters @xmath215 being all zero , i.e. the pdf is the k - distribution .",
    "thus , @xmath216 can be readily obtained in closed form from by replacing @xmath118 with @xmath217 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrccomparison ] , the abep of @xmath218 mimo osm links is compared with the abep of @xmath219 coherent fso systems with dpsk . and identically distributed links are considered . in order to compare these systems under the same propagation conditions , it is assumed that @xmath220 , @xmath198 , @xmath194 and @xmath221 . as it can be observed , when either mrc or sc are employed ,",
    "although coherent dpsk performs worse than osm for values of @xmath193 up to approximately 1 , it outperforms osm at lower values of @xmath193 .",
    "moreover , although the osm outperforms the alamouti scheme for @xmath182 and 3 , it performs similarly for high snr values when @xmath222 . it is noted that for @xmath222 and lower values of @xmath193 the alamouti scheme yields the best performance of the considered osm schemes .",
    "when more transmit appertures are employed , however , this advantage is compensated by the superior spectral efficiency of osm and its lower hardware complexity as compared to coherent mrc .",
    "specifically , as pointed out in @xcite , osm offers increased spectral efficiency by a factor @xmath4 . moreover , as only one transmitting aperture is activated at any symbol duration , osm has a lower decoding complexity as compared to conventional mrc and alamouti schemes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : coded ] , upper bounds on the abep of convolutional coded @xmath223 and @xmath223 osm systems are depicted , assuming similar propagation conditions to those considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : abep2 ] .",
    "considering a convolutional code with rate @xmath224 and constraint length of 3 , its transfer function is given as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 8.2.6 ) ) @xmath225 = \\frac{d(\\theta)^6 n}{1 - 2nd(\\theta)^2}.\\ ] ] substituting to , a union bound on the abep can be obtained as @xmath226 the performance results of fig .",
    "[ fig : coded ] clearly show that , as expected , the incorporation of convolutional coding significantly enhances the performance of osm systems , even when a small number of receive apertures is employed , even for @xmath227 .",
    "in this paper , the use of spatial modulation technique for coherent fso communication systems has been proposed .",
    "we have provided a comprehensive analytical framework for error performance analysis in the presence of atmospheric turbulence scattering channel models which include the h - k distribution .",
    "the proposed framework reveals important information about the performance of osm over such turbulent channels , including the effect of fading severity and the achievable diversity gain .",
    "it also provides valuable insight into the impact of channel parameters on performance of osm .",
    "upper bounds for the abep performance of coded osm systems have also been derived , demonstrating that coding techniques can greatly enhance the performance of osm .",
    "extensive computer simulation performance evaluation results have been also obtained which have verified the accuracy of the analytical approach .",
    "important trends about the performance of osm for a variety of atmospheric turbulent scenarios and mimo setups have also been identified .",
    "for example , it was shown that osm can provide significant performance enhancements in the presence of atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the improvements are comparable to the ones offered by conventional coherent systems with spatial diversity , while outperforming the latter in terms of spectral efficiency and hardware complexity .",
    "besides , under specific propagation conditions , osm can yield better performance than conventional simo systems employing mrc or sc .",
    "we believe that the proposed framework is a useful tool for understanding the performance trend , important properties and tradeoffs of outdoor osm operating in the presence of atmospheric turbulence .",
