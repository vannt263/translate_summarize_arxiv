    "after searching for the higgs boson for decades , the recent discovery of a new state resembling the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  @xcite at the cern lhc  @xcite marks the dawn of the direct exploration of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) sector . in order to determine whether this new particle is indeed the higgs boson predicted by the sm we must determine its properties like spin , parity  @xcite , and couplings  @xcite , as well as keep searching for further states that might be connected to the ewsb sector .",

    "we will denote all these coefficients without the prime .      in the effective lagrangian framework",
    "not all operators at a given order are independent as they can be related by the use of the classical equations of motion ( eom ) of the sm fields .",
    "the invariance of the physical observables under the associated operator redefinitions is guaranteed as it has been proved that operators connected by the eom lead to the same @xmath10matrix elements  @xcite . in a top  bottom approach , when starting from the full theory and integrating out heavy degrees of freedom to match the coefficients of the higher dimension operators at low energies it is convenient not to choose a minimal set of operators in order to guarantee that the operators generated by the underlying theory can be easily identified  @xcite .",
    "however , in a bottom  up approach when we use the effective lagrangians to obtain bounds on generic extensions of the sm , we must choose a minimum operator basis to avoid parameters combinations that can not be probed .    in our case at hand",
    ", we have to take into account the sm eom which imply that not all the operators in eqs .",
    "( [ eff ] ) and ( [ eq : hffop ] ) are independent .",
    "in particular the eom for the higgs field and the electroweak gauge bosons lead to three relations between the operators : @xmath101 these constraints allow for the elimination of three operators listed in eqs .",
    "( [ eff ] ) and ( [ eq : hffop ] ) .    at this point",
    "we are faced with the decision of which operators to leave in the basis to be used in the analysis of the higgs data ; different approaches can be followed in doing so .",
    "again , in a top  bottom approach in which some _ a priori _ knowledge is assumed about the beyond the sm theory one can use this theoretical prejudice to choose the basis .",
    "for example if the uv completion of the sm is a given gauge theory , it is possible to predict whether a given operator is generated at tree level or at loop level  @xcite .",
    "one may then be tempted to keep those in the basis as larger coefficients are expected  @xcite . however , in the absence of such illumination it is impossible to know if the low energy theory would contain any tree ",
    "level generated operator ; for instance see ref .",
    "@xcite for a model whose low energy theory contains only loop induced operators .",
    "furthermore , caution should be used when translating the bounds on the effective operators into the scale of the new physics since after the use of eom coefficients of operators generated at loop level can , in fact , originate from tree level operators eliminated using the eom and vice  versa  @xcite .",
    "in fact , all choices of basis suffer from this problem !    in principle , given the proof of the equivalence of the @xmath10matrix elements the determination of physical observables like production cross sections or decay branching ratios would be independent of the choice of basis .",
    "nevertheless independent does not mean equivalent in real life .",
    "for this reason in this work we advocate that in the absence of theoretical prejudices it turns out to be beneficial to use a basis chosen by the data : `` power to the data '' . with this",
    "we mean that the sensible ( and certainly technically convenient ) choice is to leave in the basis to be used to study higgs results those operators which are more directly related to the existing data , in particular to the bulk of precision electroweak measurements which have helped us to establish the sm .",
    "first , let us notice that presently there is data on triple electroweak gauge boson vertices ( tgv )  @xcite that should be considered in the choice of basis .",
    "the operators @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath35 , and @xmath26 modify the triple gauge ",
    "boson couplings @xmath104 and @xmath105 that can be parametrized as  @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "in general these vertices involve six dimensionless couplings  @xcite @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 @xmath112 or @xmath113 . notwithstanding the electromagnetic gauge invariance",
    "requires that @xmath114 , while the three remaining couplings are related to the dimension  six operators @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath115 , and @xmath26 @xmath116    next we notice that the @xmath42 and @xmath43 couplings to fermions as well as the oblique parameters @xmath10 , @xmath45 , @xmath117 are in agreement with the sm at the per mil to per cent level  @xcite .",
    "these results impose severe constraints on the operators which modify these observables : @xmath118 and @xmath26 .",
    "for example @xmath35 and @xmath26 give a tree level contribution to @xmath10 and @xmath45  @xcite @xmath119 however , in order to take full advantage of these electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) we must be sure that there is no combination of the anomalous operators whose contribution at the tree level to ewpo cancels out , _",
    "i.e. _  we must avoid the existence of _ blind _",
    "directions  @xcite .    in order to illustrate this point",
    "let us analyze the dependence on the anomalous couplings of a subset of the ewpo that contains the @xmath43 mass ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath43 leptonic width ( @xmath120 ) , the @xmath42 width into charged leptons ( @xmath121 ) , the leptonic @xmath42 left - right asymmetry ( @xmath122 ) , and the invisible @xmath42 width ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "in general we can write the departures of the observables ( @xmath124 ) from the sm predictions as  @xcite @xmath125 where the matrix @xmath126 is given by @xmath127    it is easy to verify that the matrix @xmath126 exhibits two zero eigenvalues , indicating that 2 coupling constant combinations can not be determined .",
    "in general there are two blind directions even when we consider all lep observables . in our example , the blind directions are @xmath128 this means that there are two combinations of operators which do not contribute to these leptonic observables , these are any two linear combination of @xmath129 there is a deep relation between operators that do not lead to any tree level contribution to the ewpo and blind directions .",
    "in fact , if the elimination of one of these operators using the eom leads to a combination of operators that contribute at tree level to the ewpo , then this combination defines a blind direction because it has the same @xmath10 matrix element than the original operator that has no impact on the ewpo @xcite .",
    "for instance the bosonic operator @xmath27 does not contribute to the ewpo since it modifies only the higgs couplings , therefore , it is a blind operator . using the eom given in eqs .",
    "( [ rel1])([rel3 ] ) we can write that @xmath130 \\;\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the right hand side of the last equation defines a blind direction in the ewpo .",
    "in fact , only the operators @xmath35 and @xmath131 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fi2 ] ) contribute to the above leptonic observables , therefore the effect of @xmath27 is equivalent to , for these observables , @xmath132 that corresponds to the blind direction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : blindlep ] ) .    the relations ( [ rel1])([rel3 ] ) allows the elimination of three dimension  six operators from the basis .",
    "as just discussed , in order to take full advantage of the electroweak precision measurements we should avoid the existence of blind directions in the parameter space .",
    "this is achieved by using eom to eliminate operators that contribute at tree level to the ewpo in such way that the new form of the matrix @xmath126 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lepobs1 ] ) has a non - vanishing determinant . for example eliminating two combinations of @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "furthermore , we also remove @xmath28 using eq .",
    "( [ rel1 ] ) .",
    "notice that our choice for the operator basis allows us to take full advantage of the ewpo , as well as , of data on tgv . in brief ,",
    "the relevant operators for the higgs physics appearing in our dimension  six operator basis are @xmath135 except for @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "now we can easily use the available experimental information in order to reduce the number of relevant parameters in the analysis of the higgs data .    * taking into account the bulk of precision data on @xmath42 and @xmath43 fermionic currents and oblique corrections discussed above , the coefficients of all operators that modify these couplings are so constrained that they will have no impact in the higgs physics .",

    "six operators considered contribute to the higgs  gauge boson and higgs  fermion couplings at tree level .",
