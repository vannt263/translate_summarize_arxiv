    "a large class of dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) is based on manganese doping of iii - v or group - iv hosts having the zincblende , wurzite , or diamond structure .",
    "formally , mn is either a single or double acceptor , depending on whether it substitutes for a group - iii or -iv atom , respectively.@xcite aside from this difference , there are no simple guidelines for predicting how the magnetic behavior of the resulting dms depends on the choice of host semiconductor . elucidating such guidelines would be of great practical interest for efforts to control and optimize the magnetic properties of dms materials . in particular",
    ", it would be very helpful to understand how the resulting curie temperatures depend on the choice of host semiconductor .",
    "an important and early contribution was made by , who used a mean - field solution of the zener model to predict the curie temperatures for mn doping of a wide range of ii - vi , iii - v , and group - iv host semiconductors.@xcite mn ions with localized spin @xmath0=5/2 were assumed to substitute on the cation site , and to interact by an indirect exchange interaction mediated by holes .",
    "curie temperatures were calculated for fixed mn content @xmath1 and hole concentration @xmath2 @xmath3 using the mean - field result @xmath4 in this equation , the most direct dependence of @xmath5 on the host semiconductor comes from the density per unit volume of cation sites @xmath6 , which varies with the host lattice constant as @xmath7 . a much weaker dependence on the host arises from the density - of - states effective mass @xmath8 and the fermi wavevector @xmath9 .",
    "the remaining variables , i.e.  the @xmath10-@xmath11 exchange integral @xmath12 and the fermi - liquid parameter @xmath13 , were assumed not to depend on the host .    the full numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for different host semiconductors@xcite leads to values of @xmath5 that indeed track the prefactor @xmath7 quite closely.@xcite for example , the hosts with the largest lattice constants ( cdte , inas , ge ) lead to the smallest predicted curie temperatures ( below @xmath1475 k ) .",
    "likewise , the hosts with the smallest lattice constants ( zno , gan , c ) lead to the largest predicted values of @xmath5 ( well above room temperature ) .    diamond has the smallest lattice constant of all the semiconductors ( @xmath15  ) and , accordingly , the highest predicted curie temperature ( @xmath16 470 k ) .",
    "these extreme values make diamond a logical choice for examining some of the assumptions underlying the predictions of high curie temperatures for hosts having small lattice constants . in this paper",
    ", we use first - principles theoretical methods to test the assumption that mn occupies the substitutional site , with spin @xmath17 , in the diamond lattice .",
    "we find that substitutional mn has a low - spin @xmath0=1/2 ground state in diamond .",
    "moreover , because of diamond s small lattice constant , the substitutional site is energetically unfavorable relative to the much larger `` divacancy site , '' denoted @xmath18 , which we identify as the more likely mn impurity location .",
    "we analyze the electronic and magnetic structure of this divacancy mn impurity in diamond , and show that it is unlikely to lead to magnetic ordering at any reasonable temperature .",
    "most of the results reported in this article are for isolated mn impurities , which we simulate using a supercell of 64 carbon atoms in the diamond structure .",
    "all atomic positions were relaxed using total energies and forces calculated within the generalized - gradient approximation to density - functional theory ( dft ) , as implemented in vasp.@xcite carbon and mn ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used with a cutoff energy of 286 ev . for total energies , we used 2@xmath192@xmath192 monkhorst - pack sampling of the brillouin zone , and 4@xmath194@xmath194 sampling for convergence checks . in the discussion of the electronic structure of the isolated mn impurity at a divacancy site , eigenvalues at the zone center of a 128-atom supercell",
    "are reported in order that degeneracies are properly represented .    within the supercell formalism , the formation energy of a mn impurity is given by @xmath20 = e_t[{\\rm mn}^q ]                     - n_{\\rm c } \\mu_{\\rm c }                    - \\mu_{\\rm mn }                    + q e_f,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] is the total energy of a supercell containing @xmath22 carbon atoms and one mn impurity , with chemical potentials @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the charge state of the mn impurity , and @xmath26 is the fermi level . since the host crystal is elemental , the chemical potentials are simply the energy per atom in the diamond phase of carbon and the ground - state @xmath27mn .",
    "the electrical activity of a mn impurity is determined by its formation energy as a function of charge state .",
    "electrically active defects will have more than one stable charge state within the host band gap ; the value of @xmath26 for which two such charge states have equal formation energies is referred to as a `` charge transition level . '' the charge transition level between the neutral and @xmath28 states is the donor ionization energy , while the transition level between neutral and @xmath29 states is the acceptor ionization energy . in practice",
    ", the total energy of a charged supercell must be calculated by adding a uniform compensating background charge to the supercell .",
    "the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction then gives rise to a spurious madelung - like contribution to the total energy , which must be subtracted from the calculated total energy .",
    "this was done using a standard approach in which a multipole expansion of the defect charge ( up to quadrupole order ) was used to estimate the interaction energy analytically and then subtract it off.@xcite    the magnetic interaction between mn impurities in nearby divacancy sites was calculated using larger supercells of 128 carbon atoms .",
    "no relaxations were performed for these calculations ; tests for a few configurations confirmed that this approximation did not change the results significantly .",
    "the interactions are represented by numerically mapping the dft total energies into the heisenberg form . in practice",
    "this amounts to computing the difference in total energy between the parallel and antiparallel spin alignment of two mn impurities in a supercell .",
    "the mn impurity enjoys a special status as a dopant in dilute magnetic semiconductors such as mn@xmath30ga@xmath31as and mn@xmath30ge@xmath31 .",
    "it preferentially occupies the substitutional ( cation ) site , where it serves two roles : it is electrically active as an acceptor , and it contributes a localized spin @xmath17 . at sufficient mn concentrations ,",
    "holes are created in the host valence band ; these delocalized carriers mediate the ferromagnetic interaction between the localized spins.@xcite    gaas and ge have similar lattice constants , and since strain contributes to the impurity formation energy , it is instructive to note that the local strain around a substitutional mn impurity , denoted mn@xmath32 , is very small for both hosts  the nearest neighbors distort by less than 2% from their ideal positions .",
    "tetrahedrally coordinated interstitial mn impurities , denoted mn@xmath33 , have higher formation energies ( by 12 ev for neutral impurities ) ; interestingly , the atomic volume available at this site is the same as for the substitutional site , and consequently very little distortion is created by the mn interstitial in either host.@xcite    the lattice constant of diamond is 37% smaller than that of ge , and so it is not surprising that a substitutional mn impurity creates a much larger local strain in the lattice  within dft",
    "the nearest - neighbor distortion is 12% . because of the extreme stiffness of diamond",
    ", such a large strain is expected to lead to a relatively high formation energy .",
    "a similar distortion occurs for mn in the tetrahedral interstitial site .",
    "a simple way to relieve this strain is to place the mn impurity at a divacancy site  i.e .  to remove two neighboring carbon atoms and place the mn at their midpoint , as shown in fig .",
    "this doubles the atomic volume available , leading to a much reduced local strain ",
    "only 2% distortion of the nearest neighbors . even in its ground - state configuration , which includes a slight off - center relaxation of the mn ion as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the local lattice distortion around this mn@xmath34 impurity is very small .",
    "it is already widely believed that other large impurities  including si , p , ni , and co  preferentially occupy the divacancy site in diamond;@xcite hence our prediction that mn also prefers this site appears plausible .    to make the comparison between different sites quantitative we turn now to the formation energies calculated within dft . for neutral mn impurities ,",
    "we find the divacancy site is strongly preferred ( by 0.6 ev ) to the substitutional site ; the interstitial site is much less favorable than either ( by @xmath1410 ev ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the formation energies for divacancy and substitutional mn as a function of magnetic moment , calculated using the fixed - spin - moment method within dft . even in the preferred divacancy site ,",
    "the absolute formation is almost an order of magnitude larger for substitutional mn in gaas or ge , suggesting that standard methods for attaining high concentrations of magnetic dopants will probably not work for diamond .",
    "the equilibrium magnetic moments @xmath35 in the substitutional and divacancy sites are also quite different compared to substitutional mn in gaas and ge ( @xmath36 and 3 @xmath37 , respectively ) . in the substitutional site , mn adopts a low - spin @xmath38 state , with an extremely small energy gain ( 0.1 ev ) relative to the spin - unpolarized state .",
    "hence , we anticipate that even if mn could be forced into the substitutional site , its magnetic moment may not be sufficiently stable to facilitate magnetic ordering . in the divacancy site",
    "two nearly degenerate moments are found ( @xmath38 and 5 @xmath37 ) with an energy difference of only 0.05 ev ; the formation energy vs.  magnetic moment is symmetrical about @xmath39 3 @xmath37 .",
    "this peculiar feature of the mn@xmath34 impurity will be explained in section iv .",
    "the mn@xmath34 impurity has an energy - level structure that arises from the relatively weak interaction of atomic mn levels and host divacancy levels , as shown in fig .",
    "the host divacancy defect itself has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally , and is well understood.@xcite the removal of two carbon atoms from the host lattice leads to a defect with @xmath40 symmetry , and thus the six available dangling - bond orbitals must form linear combinations that transform under the irreducible representations @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44.@xcite for the neutral divacancy , six electrons are available to fill these levels . in an early theoretical study , coulson and larkins@xcite predicted the ground state one - electron configuration",
    "to be @xmath45 .",
    "later calculations confirmed this one - electron level ordering for both silicon and diamond , and we find it here too , as shown .    in fig .",
    "3 we consider separately the interaction of the majority and minority mn levels with the four divacancy levels . under the @xmath40 crystal field ,",
    "the 3@xmath11 level of mn splits into one @xmath41 and two @xmath44 levels .",
    "hence , hybridization is allowed only between mn and @xmath18 levels both having either @xmath41 or @xmath44 symmetry , but no mixing is allowed between mn levels and @xmath18 levels having either @xmath42 or @xmath43 symmetry . among the calculated majority mn@xmath46 levels we find very little mixing within any level , and therefore each has a clear parentage from either mn or @xmath18 orbitals , as indicated in fig .",
    "3 . for the minority mn@xmath47 levels",
    "there is strong mixing between the empty @xmath18 @xmath44 level and the empty mn @xmath48 level , so that the occupied bonding combination falls well below the diamond valence - band maximum ( vbm ) . considering for the moment",
    "only those levels that sit below the vbm , we find that seven electrons occupy majority levels and four electrons occupy minority levels .",
    "hence , these low - lying levels carry a net `` core '' magnetic moment @xmath49 .",
    "the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of the mn@xmath34 impurity has @xmath43 symmetry and , because it can not mix with mn states , is purely derived from the @xmath18 dangling - bond orbitals .",
    "the two electrons in this fourfold level form a spin triplet ( @xmath50 1 @xmath37 ) as shown , but the system is energetically indifferent to whether they are aligned parallel or antiparallel to the core spin ( fig .  3 shows the parallel alignment ; when the alignment is made antiparallel the spin - up and spin - down homo levels simply switch positions ) .    because of this weak coupling between the homo spin and the core spin , the total magnetic moment of mn@xmath34 can assume two possible low - energy values : either @xmath51 5 @xmath37 or @xmath52 1 @xmath37 for parallel or antiparallel alignment , respectively .",
    "moreover , there is an energy penalty for violating hund s rule by forcing the homo into a spin - singlet state ; this is the origin of the energy increase that occurs when the total moment is constrained to 3 @xmath37 ( the core moment alone ) .",
    "these two features  the weak core - homo spin coupling , and the hund s rule penalty for constraining the homo to a spin singlet  explain the unusual appearance , shown earlier in fig .  2 , of the mn@xmath34 formation energy vs.  total magnetic moment .",
    "4 we show the calculated formation energies of mn@xmath34 for charge states that are stable within the experimental 5.4-ev band gap of diamond . there are three such stable charge states ( @xmath53 ) , making mn@xmath34 formally a double acceptor . in principle",
    "this is similar to the case of substitutional mn in ge , which is also a double acceptor , and might suggest similar electrical activity for mn@xmath34 .",
    "quantitatively , however , the two cases are quite different .",
    "the first two acceptor ionization energies for mn in ge have been measured experimentally to be 160 and 370 mev , relative to the valence - band edge.@xcite for mn concentrations of several percent , the width of the resulting impurity band is sufficient to create overlap with the valence band and thus to allow the holes to delocalize .",
    "likewise , mn in gaas is a single acceptor with a measured acceptor level at 113 mev,@xcite which is accurately given by dft calculations as 100 mev .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , the predicted first acceptor ionization energy for mn@xmath34 in diamond is an order of magnitude larger , @xmath54 1.2 ev , suggesting that the holes will remain localized on the impurity sites for any reasonable mn concentration .",
    "for this reason alone , it appears very unlikely that there will be sufficient carriers to mediate a ferromagnetic interaction between the localized spins of mn@xmath34 impurities .",
    "the weak coupling between core and homo spins in the isolated mn@xmath34 impurity suggests that the effective coupling between spins of two impurities will also be weak .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in fig .  5 , where we show the results of our dft calculations for ( twice ) the heisenberg coupling constant between two mn@xmath34 impurities in a 128-atom diamond supercell .",
    "for comparison , we show the results of similar calculations for substitutional mn in ge and si .",
    "the results for substitutional mn in ge and si show a similar trend . when the two mn are nearest neighbors , there is a strong preference for antiparallel spin alignment . at larger separations",
    "the interactions vary in sign ( ge ) and/or magnitude ( si ) , a consequence of the crystallographic anisotropy that arises from the strong @xmath11 character of the acceptor wavefunction in substitutional mn .",
    "the largest ferromagnetic coupling strengths are in the range 0.1@xmath550.2 ev .",
    "( for si there is a shift of all the couplings toward more favorable ferromagnetic interactions ; since mn - doped ge is known to be ferromagnetic this suggests that mn - doped si might also be  perhaps with a higher curie temperature ) .",
    "the coupling between two mn@xmath34 impurities in diamond is substantially weaker : the largest ferromagnetic couplings are of order 1 mev , two orders of magnitude smaller than for mn in ge or si .",
    "hence , any ferromagnetically ordered phase involving mn@xmath34 impurities would be characterized by a curie temperature at most on this scale , i.e.  of order 10 k.",
    "we have shown theoretically that the mn impurity in diamond is energetically more favorable in the divacancy site than in the substitutional site .",
    "the magnetic properties of the divacancy mn impurity show nearly degenerate low - spin and high - spin configurations ; the degeneracy arises from the weak coupling of separate core and valence moments .",
    "divacancy mn is predicted to be a double acceptor with two hyperdeep levels , suggesting poor prospects for creating the delocalized holes in the valence band that are required to mediate a ferromagnetic interaction within the zener model",
    ". explicit calculation of the effective heisenberg coupling between mn in nearby divacancy sites confirms that mn - doped diamond shows little promise of ferromagnetism above a few kelvins",
    ".    our findings may not be unique to diamond : other semiconductors with predicted high curie temperatures have similarly small atomic volumes , which may likewise make the substitutional site unfavorable for mn doping .",
    "comprehensive calculations of the site energetics for gan , zno , and other host semiconductors would be of great interest .",
    "this work was supported by the office of naval research and the darpa spins in semiconductors program .",
    "computations were performed at the dod major shared resource centers at asc and navo ."
