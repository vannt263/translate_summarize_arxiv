    "planet transit searches promise to be the next big step forward for extrasolar planet detection and characterization .",
    "every transiting planet discovered will have a measured radius , which will provide constraints on planet composition , evolution , and migration history .",
    "together with radial velocity measurements , the absolute mass of every transiting planet will be determined .",
    "transiting planets can be discovered around distant stars and in a variety of environments . due to their special geometry",
    "many follow - up observations of transiting planets are possible , such as atmosphere transmission spectroscopy ( note the first extrasolar planet atmosphere detection by charbonneau et al .",
    "2002 ) , search for moons and rings ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) , and detection of oblateness and the corresponding constraint on rotation rate ( seager & hui 2002 ) .",
    "although no planet candidates discovered by the transit method have yet been confirmed by mass measurements , many searches are currently ongoing . the ogle - iii planet search ( udalski et al .",
    "2002 ) has observed numerous high - precision transit light curves from objects with small radii , including several potential planets .",
    "the explore search ( malln - ornelas et al .  2002 ; yee et al .  in preparation ) has four potential planet candidates based on both photometric light curves and follow - up radial velocity measurements ( malln - ornelas et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . the vulcan planet search ( borucki et al .",
    "2001 ) has some published results on transit candidates that , with radial velocity measurements , were determined to be eclipsing binary stars ( jenkins , caldwell , & borucki 2002 ) .",
    "follow - up mass determination by radial velocity measurements are needed for planet transit candidates because late m dwarfs ( @xmath1 ) , brown dwarfs ( @xmath2 ) , and gas giant planets ( @xmath3 ) are all of similar sizes .",
    "this is due to a coincidental balance between coulomb forces ( which cause @xmath4 ) and electron degeneracy pressure ( which causes @xmath5 ) .",
    "a high yield of confirmed planets from a list of planet candidates considered for mass follow - up is important , especially for planet searches with faint stars ( e.g. , fainter than 13th magnitude ) which require relatively long exposures on 8-m class telescopes ( e.g. , 2030 mins per star for a single radial velocity measurement ) .",
    "hence understanding the transit light curves before follow - up can be crucial if a given project has a large number of planet transit candidates .",
    "an analytical solution is always worthwhile to understand the general properties of a given physical system in an intuitive form .",
    "this is the case even when numerical fits are in practice the best way to determine the system parameters . in the case of a planet transit light curve we found that there is a unique solution for the five parameters stellar mass @xmath6 , stellar radius @xmath7 , companion radius @xmath0 , orbital distance @xmath8 , and orbital inclination @xmath9 , under some important assumptions",
    "this unique solution has several interesting applications  especially when the photometric precision and time sampling are high  including selection of the best planet candidates for follow - up mass measurements .",
    "selection of the best candidates is especially important if the tendency for planets with small orbital distances to have low mass ( zucker & mazeh 2002 )  and hence low radial velocity amplitudes  is generally true . in this case , on average , more effort to detect the planet mass via radial velocity variations of the parent star will be needed since the primary star s radial velocity amplitude scales linearly with planet mass .",
    "the unique solution to a light curve with two or more transits was first mentioned in malln - ornelas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where an approximate set of equations and a short description were presented .",
    "sackett ( 1995 ) briefly touches on the unique solution by outlining parameter derivation with a known stellar spectral type , including a mention of period determination from a single transit .",
    "we begin this paper by describing the assumptions necessary to determine the unique solution in  2 . in  3 , for the first time , we present both the general set of equations that describe a planet transit light curve and their analytic solution .",
    "we discuss the errors in the parameters , and hence the limiting photometric precision and time sampling needed for the applications outlined in this paper in  4 .",
    "the complications of limb - darkening are discussed in  5 . in ",
    "6 we present four interesting applications that are made possible by the unique solution to the planet transit light curve .",
    " 7 concludes this paper with a summary .",
    "the unique determination of the stellar mass @xmath6 , stellar radius @xmath7 , companion radius @xmath0 , orbital distance @xmath8 , and orbital inclination @xmath9 from a light curve with two or more eclipses requires the following assumptions : + @xmath10 the planet orbit is circular ; + @xmath10 @xmath11 and the companion is dark compared to the central star ; + @xmath10 the stellar mass - radius relation is known ; + @xmath10 the light comes from a single star , rather than from two or more blended stars .",
    "+ the unique determination also requires the light curve to fulfill the following conditions : + @xmath10 the eclipses have flat bottoms which implies that the companion is fully superimposed on the central star s disk ; + @xmath10 the period can be derived from the light curve ( e.g. , the two observed eclipses are consecutive ) .",
    "the first three assumptions are all reasonable for current extrasolar planet transit searches .",
    "circular orbits are expected for short - period planets due to their short tidal circularization timescale , and all but one of the currently known short - period planets ( @xmath12 days ) have eccentricities consistent with zero .",
    "all current ground - based transit searches are searching for or expecting to find mostly short - period planets which have the highest geometric probability to show transits .",
    "the stellar mass - radius relation is reasonably well - known for each separate class of stars ( e.g. , main sequence ) , and as we show later , the mass - radius relation is not needed for a derivation of all parameters . the only assumption that has a significant chance of being wrong is the presence of a blended star ( e.g. , from a physical stellar companion ) ; this situation and its possible identification",
    "are discussed in  [ sec - applications ] .",
    "the required conditions listed above are also all reasonable .",
    "flat - bottomed transits will appear in a band pass where limb darkening is negligible , such as @xmath13-band .",
    "several transit surveys are using @xmath13-band including ogle - iii ( udalski et al .",
    "2002 ) , explore ( malln - ornelas et al .",
    "2002 ) , and stepps ( c. j. burke et al . , in preparation ) , and follow - up measurements for other surveys could be taken in @xmath13-band or in even a redder color in order to exploit the unique solution discussed in this paper .",
    "( see  [ sec - ld ] for a discussion of limb darkening ) . for the rest of the paper we will work under the assumptions and conditions listed above , unless otherwise stated .",
    "there are five equations that completely describe the planet transit light curve .",
    "the first three equations ( equations ( [ eq : depthorig])([eq : durationorig ] ) ) describe the geometry of the transit in terms of transit depth , transit shape , and transit duration ( see figure  [ fig : schema ] ) . for a planet transit light curve which is due to two spheres passing in front of each other",
    ", the geometry is relatively straightforward ( see sackett ( 1995 ) for a derivation of the the transit duration equation  ( [ eq : durationorig ] ) ) .",
    "here we parameterize the transit shape by both @xmath14 , the total transit duration ( first to fourth contact ) , and by @xmath15 , the duration of the transit completely inside ingress and egress ( second to third contact ) .",
    "the three geometrical equations that describe the transit light curve depend on four observables : the period @xmath16 , the transit depth @xmath17 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 . see figure  [ fig : schema ] for an illustrative definition of @xmath17 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to the three geometrical equations there are two physical equations ( equations  ( [ eq : keplerorig])([eq : mrorig ] ) ) , kepler s third law and the stellar mass - radius relation . it is these physical equations that break the degeneracy of the mathematical description of two spheres passing in front of each other , by setting a physical scale .",
    "it is this physical scale , together with the geometrical description , that allows the unique solution .",
    "the equations are : the transit depth , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 defined as the total observed flux , @xmath19 the transit shape , described by the ratio of the duration of the `` flat part''of the transit ( @xmath15 ) to the total transit duration ( @xmath14 ) @xmath20^{1/2}\\right ) } } {   \\arcsin { \\left ( \\frac{\\rstar}{a}\\left [ \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\rplanet}{\\rstar } \\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{a}{\\rstar } \\cos i\\right)^2}{1 - \\cos^2 i}\\right]^{1/2}\\right)}};\\ ] ] the total transit duration @xmath21^{1/2}\\right)};\\ ] ] kepler s third law , assuming a circular orbit , where @xmath22 is the universal gravitational constant and @xmath23 the planet mass , @xmath24 and the stellar mass radius relation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant coefficient for each stellar sequence ( main sequence , giants , etc . ) and @xmath27 describes the power law of the sequence ( e.g. , @xmath28 for f  k main sequence stars ( cox 2000 ) ) .",
    "we ultimately wish to solve for the five unknown parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath31 from the five equations above .",
    "it is first useful to note that four combinations of physical parameters can be found directly from the observables ( @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) using only the first four equations above ( the three transit geometry equations and kepler s third law with @xmath32 ) ; this avoids any uncertainty from the stellar mass - radius relation .",
    "the four combinations of parameters are : the planet - star radius ratio which trivially follows from equation  ( [ eq : depthorig ] ) , @xmath33 the impact parameter @xmath34 , defined as the projected distance between the planet and star centers during mid - transit in units of @xmath30 ( see figure  [ fig : schema ] ) , and which can be derived directly from the transit shape equation  ( [ eq : shapeorig ] ) , together with equation  ( [ eq : depthdef ] ) , @xmath35^{1/2};\\ ] ] the ratio @xmath36 which can be derived directly from the transit duration equation  ( [ eq : durationorig ] ) , @xmath37^{1/2};\\ ] ] and the stellar density @xmath38 which can be derived from the above equation for @xmath39 and kepler s third law with @xmath40 ( equation  ( [ eq : keplerorig ] ) ) , @xmath41 \\left[\\frac { ( 1 + \\sqrt{\\delta f})^2 - b^2 ( 1 - \\sin^2 \\frac { t_t \\pi}{p } ) } { \\sin^2 \\frac { t_t \\pi}{p}}\\right]^{3/2}.\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath39 are dimensionless .",
    "the density can also be written with the first term on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : rhoorig ] ) replaced by @xmath42 , with @xmath16 in days .",
    "it is interesting to consider the geometrical and physical origin of these combinations of parameters .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath34 depends almost entirely on the transit shape ( parameterized by @xmath43 ) and ratio of planet and star sizes ( @xmath44 ) . to a lesser extent ( cf .",
    " [ sec - simpsoln ] ) @xmath34 depends mildly on the period .",
    "the term @xmath39 is the ratio of orbital distance to planet radius ; to first order it is related to the ratio of transit duration to total period .",
    "the term @xmath39 is also dependent on the impact parameter @xmath34 and planet - star size ratio , because these parameters affect the transit duration .",
    "the stellar density , @xmath38 , comes from kepler s third law and the transit duration @xmath14 ; kepler s third law describes how much mass is enclosed inside the planet s orbit and the stellar radius is described by the transit duration with a physical scale set by kepler s third law .",
    "again , @xmath38 is also dependent on the impact parameter @xmath34 and the planet - star size ratio , because these parameters affect the transit duration .",
    "the five physical parameters @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath0 can be derived from the above solution for @xmath45 , @xmath34 , @xmath46 , and @xmath38 by using one additional equation : the stellar mass - radius relation ( equation  ( [ eq : mrorig ] ) ) .",
    "to derive @xmath29 , consider equation  ( [ eq : rhoorig ] ) together with the stellar mass - radius relation in the form @xmath47 : @xmath48^{\\frac{1}{1 - 3x}}.\\ ] ] the stellar radius can be derived from the stellar mass by the stellar mass - radius relation , or from the density directly , @xmath49^{\\frac{x}{(1 - 3x)}};\\ ] ] the orbital radius @xmath8 can be derived from @xmath6 and from kepler s third law with @xmath11 , @xmath50^{1/3};\\ ] ] based on the definition of impact parameter ( equation  ( [ eq : borig ] ) ) , the orbital inclination is , @xmath51 and most importantly the planetary radius is @xmath52^{\\frac{x}{(1 - 3x ) } } \\sqdepth.\\ ] ] for main sequence stars @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in which case @xmath55 .",
    "the equations and five - parameter solution take on a simpler form under the assumption @xmath56 .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to @xmath57 ( from equation  ( [ eq : arorig ] ) ) , and has as its consequence @xmath58 ( from equation  ( [ eq : iorig ] ) ) .",
    "systems we are interested in generally have @xmath59 and likely @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 .",
    "mathematically this assumption allows @xmath62 and @xmath63 . under this approximation , @xmath64 .",
    "a comparison of these two terms is shown figure  [ fig : sinapprox]a ; for cases of interest the terms agree to better than 4% and much better in most cases . under the approximation @xmath57 , a second term of interest , @xmath65 . a comparison of this term as a function of @xmath66 ( figure  [ fig : sinapprox]b ) shows agreement to better than 2.5% for cases of interest .",
    "the simplified solution will allow us to explore useful applications analytically in  [ sec - applications ] .      under the approximations @xmath57 ,",
    "the transit shape ( equation  ( [ eq : shapeorig ] ) ) with @xmath67 becomes independent of @xmath16 , @xmath68 and the total transit duration , ( equation  ( [ eq : durationorig ] ) ) , with @xmath69 becomes @xmath70 the other three equations for transit depth ( equation  ( [ eq : depthorig ] ) ) , kepler s third law ( equation  ( [ eq : keplerorig ] ) ) , and the mass - radius relation ( equation  ( [ eq : mrorig ] ) ) , remain the same as in the exact solution",
    ". note that by substituting @xmath71 and @xmath72 the above equations take a very simple form .",
    "the solution to the simplified equations is more useful than the exact solution for considering the general properties of light curves because @xmath16 either cancels out of the solution or is a simple factor which can cancel out in parameter ratios .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath34 ( equation  ( [ eq : borig ] ) ) , under the approximation @xmath57 , becomes @xmath73^{1/2};\\ ] ] the ratio @xmath36 ( equation  ( [ eq : arorig ] ) ) becomes @xmath74 and the stellar density @xmath38 ( equation  ( [ eq : rhoorig ] ) ) becomes @xmath75 note that for @xmath76 and @xmath14 in days , the first factor on the right side of equation  ( [ eq : rhoapprox ] ) becomes @xmath77 .",
    "the equation for @xmath78 ( equation  ( [ eq : depthdef ] ) ) clearly remains the same as in the non - simplified case .",
    "the stellar mass , stellar radius , orbital distance , orbital inclination , and planet radius can be derived as before with equations  ( [ eq : morig])([eq : rporig ] ) .",
    "in principle the unique solution of @xmath38 and of the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath31 provides a powerful tool for understanding the transit light curve and more importantly for selecting the best transit candidates for radial velocity follow - up . in practice the usefulness of the unique solution",
    "is limited by errors caused by the limited photometric precision and time sampling of real data .",
    "the errors in the the star - planet parameters are very non - gaussian and often correlated so a simulation is necessary in order to estimate errors . to compute the errors as a function of photometric precision and time sampling",
    ", we generated one thousand simulated transits with added gaussian noise in the photometry for each of several combinations of photometric precision ( @xmath79 ) and time sampling ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "we considered values of @xmath79 of 0.0025 , 0.005 , 0.01 , and 0.015 mag and values of @xmath81 of 2.7 , 6 , and 12 minutes .",
    "note that the shortest time sampling and highest photometric precision are reachable by current transit surveys ( e.g. , malln - ornelas et al .",
    "we then fit the simulated transits for period , phase , depth , impact parameter , and stellar density with a @xmath82 minimization fit .",
    "additionally we solved for the planet radius using the main sequence stellar mass - radius relation with @xmath83 .",
    "for specificity we chose a star - planet model of @xmath84 days , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87% ( hence @xmath88 ) .",
    "limb darkening was not included ( see  [ sec - ld ] ) .",
    "we considered models with two different impact parameters ( @xmath89 which corresponds to @xmath90 and @xmath91 which corresponds to @xmath92 ) , because the errors are very sensitive to impact parameter of the input transit .",
    "although for specificity we have focused on a single model ( with two different impact parameters ) , for the purpose of error estimates changing @xmath14 ( by a change in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath8 ; see equation  ( [ eq : durationorig ] ) or ( [ eq : durationapprox ] ) ) is equivalent to a linear change in time sampling , and changing @xmath17 ( by a change in @xmath31 or @xmath30 ; see equation  ( [ eq : depthorig ] ) ) is equivalent to a linear change in photometric precision .",
    "thus errors in parameters from other models can be considered using the same computational results . here",
    "we focus on the two most interesting parameters , @xmath38 which can tell us if the star is on or close to the main sequence , and @xmath31 an obvious quantity of interest for selecting the best planet candidates .",
    "the errors in @xmath38 and @xmath31 are dominated by errors in the impact parameter @xmath34 , which we discuss first .",
    "figure  [ fig : bvstf ] shows that for a given @xmath17 there is a one - to - one correspondence between the impact parameter @xmath34 and the transit shape as parameterized by @xmath43 ; this one - to - one correspondence is one of the reasons for the existence of the unique solution . for",
    "`` box - shaped '' transits with large values of @xmath43 , a small change in @xmath43 can result in a very large change in @xmath34making it difficult to derive @xmath34 accurately from box - shaped transit light curves .",
    "this is not the case for transits with small @xmath43 ( i.e. , with very long ingress / egress times ) , where @xmath34 changes little even for a relatively large change in @xmath43 . in the case of noisy data",
    ", @xmath34 will be underestimated due to asymmetric errors resulting from the non - linear relation between @xmath34 and @xmath43 .",
    "an underestimate in @xmath34 corresponds to an overestimate in @xmath38 and an underestimate in @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "figures  [ fig : berror ] , [ fig : rhoerror ] and [ fig : rperror ] show the errors in @xmath34 and the fractional errors in @xmath38 and @xmath31 for the simulations on the specific transit model described above .",
    "results for @xmath93 are shown on the left panels , and results for @xmath94 are shown on the right panels .",
    "the top and middle panels respectively show the rms and the median of the difference between the fit results and the input parameter ( e.g. , the rms and median of \\{@xmath95 } , where the @xmath96 are the fit results from each of the 1000 simulated noisy light curves , and @xmath97 is the actual value used to create those light curves ) .",
    "the bottom panels show histograms of the fit results for each combination of photometric precision and time sampling .",
    "the vertical dotted lines indicate the correct value for the parameter in question ( 0.2 or 0.7 for @xmath34 , and 0 in the case of fractional deviation for @xmath38 and @xmath31 ) . from the median deviation plots and the histograms themselves ,",
    "notice the severe systematic underestimate of @xmath34 and the resulting over - estimate of @xmath38 and @xmath31 for cases with @xmath98  mag and @xmath94 .",
    "the rms fractional errors in @xmath38 are 10% for @xmath89 and 20% for @xmath91 for a photometric precision of 0.0025 and a time sampling of 2.7 minutes . for this photometric precision and time sampling ,",
    "the errors in @xmath31 are less than 10% ( neglecting uncertainty in the stellar mass - radius relation ) .",
    "the errors in @xmath31 are @xmath99% for time samplings @xmath100 minutes and photometric precision @xmath101 .",
    "these errors are quoted for the model used here , and as described above errors for models with different parameters ( with the exception of changes in @xmath34 ) can be derived by scaling @xmath80 and @xmath79 together with @xmath14 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that folded transits from multiple low - time - sampled transit light curves can be used for higher effective time sampling and are useful as long as the photometric precision is high enough .",
    "a main point of these error simulations is that the transit shape must be well defined by high photometric precision and high time sampling , because most star - planet parameters depend on transit shape .",
    "specifically a limiting factor is time sampling of ingress and egress and their start and end times to determine transit shape .",
    "the errors for different combinations of photometric precison ( @xmath79 ) and time sampling ( @xmath80 ) are related because the total s / n per transit is based on both @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in particular the total number of photons per transit goes roughly as : @xmath102 it is interesting to note that our simulations show that the same error distribution will result from @xmath80 and @xmath79 combinations that give the same total number of photons per transit .",
    "e.g. , compare the errors for a given @xmath80 and @xmath79 with those for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : rperror ] where the same errors and error distribution results for @xmath105 mins , @xmath106  mag and for @xmath107 mins , @xmath108  mag . taking this into account , an optimal strategy of time sampling and exposure time",
    "can be chosen for a given mirror size and detector read time .",
    "note that in practice , @xmath109  is required in order to reach reasonable errors in the derived parameters .",
    "the transit light curve equations , their solution , and applications described in this paper assume no limb darkening . for the framework used in this paper , @xmath15 ( see figure  [ fig : schema ] ) must be measureable from the light curve  this is only possibly at wavelengths where limb darkening is weak .",
    "figure  [ fig : ld ] shows that @xmath15 and @xmath14 are distinguishable for measurements at @xmath13-band . at bluer",
    "band passes limb darkening becomes significant and it is not clear when the ingress / egress ends and begins and when the planet is fully superimposed on the star .",
    "it is possible to incorporate limb darkening into the mathematical description of a planet transit light curve by parameterizing the transit shape by the slope of the ingress / egress instead of by @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "the slope of ingress / egress is given by the time derivative of the transit area equation , including a parameterization for limb darkening .",
    "figure  [ fig : ld ] shows that the slope of ingress / egress is similar for a planet transit in different colors ; the different slopes are generally equivalent within typical observational errors .",
    "this is because , for @xmath110 , the ingress / egress slope is mainly due to the time it takes the planet to cross the stellar limb . in addition , the depth of the transit is affected by limb darkening . as a consequence of these two additions the equations that describe the transit light curve",
    "take a cumbersome form and there is no longer a simple analytical solution .",
    "of course a model fit with limb darkening can still be used to determine the parameters of the system . however , for a quick parameter estimate and the applications described in  [ sec - applications ] an analytic solution is simple and practical ; @xmath13-band or redder observations can be used to circumvent the complications of limb darkening .",
    "the existence of a unique solution to a planet transit light curve has several applications .",
    "the first application is an analytic solution for planet - star parameters by using the equations in  [ sec - fivesoln ] with the values from  [ sec - foursoln ] or  [ sec - simpsoln ] .",
    "this analytical solution is useful for a quick parameter estimate . in this section",
    "we use the simplified analytic solution (  [ sec - approx ] ) to explore the usefulness of four additional applications .",
    "the density @xmath111 , as described analytically in equations  ( [ eq : rhoorig ] ) and ( [ eq : rhoapprox ] ) , is directly measurable from the light curve observables ( @xmath17 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) , together with kepler s third law .",
    "a measured density makes it possible to immediately distinguish between a main sequence star and a giant star from the transit light curve alone ( i.e. , without color data or spectra ) . knowing the stellar size to first order immediately is useful for an estimate of @xmath31 from the depth of the transit ( equation  ( [ eq : rporig ] ) ) .",
    "for example , eclipses of @xmath112% for a giant star would be caused by a stellar companion , not a planetary companion .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhovsmass ] shows the density as a function of spectral type .",
    "a density measurement would give a position on the @xmath113-axis only .",
    "as shown by the box in figure  [ fig : rhovsmass ] , f0v to m0v stars occupy a unique region of stellar density parameter space .",
    "hence a density measurement can tell us that a given star is in the vicinity of main sequence stars .",
    "the main sequence stellar spectral type can be estimated for a given @xmath38 by using the mass - radius relation for main sequence stars .",
    "the stellar type ( and hence @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) may not be identified with 100% certainty from @xmath38 alone due to confusion with stars slightly evolved off of the main sequence ; the unique density derivation clearly does not specify the actual stellar mass and radius . as main sequence stars begin to leave the main sequence they will evolve with constant mass to lower density as their radius increases ( on vertical downward lines in figure  [ fig : rhovsmass ] ) .",
    "these slightly evolved stars will fill in the box in figure  [ fig : rhovsmass ] to the lower left of the main sequence star diagonal line . nevertheless , for a given @xmath38 the corresponding @xmath30 of a main - sequence star will always be the upper limit of @xmath30 , whether or not the star is slightly evolved .",
    "thus , we can always determine an upper limit to @xmath30and hence to @xmath31from @xmath38 alone .",
    "furthermore , a lower limit to @xmath30 for a given @xmath38 can be derived with the consideration that stars with @xmath114 do not leave the main sequence in a hubble time .",
    "note that for densities corresponding f0v to m0v stars , the largest error in the radius estimation will occur for an evolved @xmath115 star with the density of an f0v star ; in this extreme scenario , the radius over - estimate of the evolved star is only 25% .",
    "beyond using the light curve alone , a derived surface gravity from a spectrum ( measured to @xmath116% precision for non - metal poor stars near the main sequence ( allende prieto et al .",
    "1999 ) ) can be used with @xmath38 derived from the transit light curve to determine @xmath29 and @xmath30 . note that highly evolved stars will never be confused with main sequence or slightly evolved stars , since @xmath38 will be significantly lower for highly evolved stars .",
    "the errors for @xmath38 are described in  [ sec - errors ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : rhoerror ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhovsmass ] shows a plot of density vs. main sequence spectral type , together with reference error bars . with an error in @xmath15 and @xmath14 of @xmath117 5 minutes , and errors in @xmath118% , the stellar density can be constrained to 10%20% depending on the transit shape ( see  [ sec - errors ] ) .",
    "a consequence of the unique solution of @xmath38 is that transit fitting codes which find equally good fits for different combinations of @xmath29 and @xmath30 actually find _ the same @xmath38 _ for these best fits .",
    "the five - parameter solution to a planet transit light curve with two or more transits is not unique if there is additional light from a blended star ( or indeed if any of the assumptions in  [ sec - assumptions ] are not fulfilled ) .",
    "a planet transit light curve can be mimicked by a stellar binary eclipsing system with contaminating light from a third , fully blended star .",
    "the additional light from the blended star causes an otherwise deep eclipse to appear shallow , and hence to mimic a planet transit light curve , as shown in figure  [ fig : blenddef ] .",
    "this confusion is possible only when the eclipsing system has a flat - bottomed light curve , meaning that the eclipsing companion is fully superimposed on its primary star .",
    "hereafter we call the eclipsing system plus the third fully blended star a `` blend '' .",
    "the true , or actual , star - planet parameters will be confused by the contamination of blended light from an additional star . for selecting planet candidates for radial velocity follow - up",
    "it is useful to consider how some of the derived star and planet parameters change in the presence of blended light . in the following discussion",
    "we compare star and planet parameters naively derived from a transit light curve assuming no blend against those parameters derived by assuming the maximum possible amount of blended light .",
    "the maximum amount of blended light for a given @xmath17 is computed by considering the largest possible companion consistent with a given ingress / egress duration .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming a central transit ( i.e. , @xmath119 ) , and computing the maximum @xmath17 possible for that given ingress / egress ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "specifically , using @xmath120 in equation  ( [ eq : shapeapprox ] ) , @xmath121 here the subscript @xmath34 refers to a blend ; the subscript @xmath122 refers to the eclipsing system parameters derived ignoring the presence of the third fully blended star whereas the subscript @xmath123 refers to the actual parameters of the eclipsing binary .",
    "the subscript @xmath124 refers to the quantities for the case of maximum possible blend ( defined for a given @xmath43 ) .",
    "@xmath125 is the eclipse depth as taken from the observed light curve , and @xmath126 is the actual eclipse depth ( i.e. , in the absence of the blended star ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath127 is shown in figure  [ fig : blendrp]a .",
    "it is useful to consider the maximum difference between the density derived from a transit light curve in the presence of a blend ( @xmath128 ) and the actual density of the eclipsed star ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "we do this by using the simplified equation for @xmath38 equation  ( [ eq : rhoapprox ] ) , to compute the ratio @xmath130 : @xmath131^{3/4}.\\ ] ] the stellar density is always underestimated from the light curve if a blend is present and ignored .",
    "a comparison of @xmath132 and @xmath128 is shown in figure  [ fig : rhovssp]b and is used in an application in subsection [ sec - blendslcsp ] .",
    "we can explore how the planet radius is affected by blends by considering how @xmath38 is affected by blends ( equation  ( [ eq : blendlimit ] ) ) together with the simplified solution for planet radius , equation  ( [ eq : rporig ] ) .",
    "the actual radius of the eclipsing companion , @xmath133 , is related to the radius naively derived from the transit light curve ignoring the presence of a blend , @xmath134 , by @xmath135 ^{\\frac{3x-2}{12x-4 } } \\leq \\left [ \\frac{\\delta f_{b , real , max}}{\\delta f_{b , obs } } \\right ] ^{\\frac{3x-2}{12x-4}},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the exponent in the stellar mass - radius relation ( equation  ( [ eq : mrorig ] ) ) . for main sequence stars , @xmath136 ( cox 2000 ) and",
    "the exponent in equation  ( [ eq : rpb ] ) becomes 0.071 , so @xmath137 is mildly dependent on the amount of blended light present .",
    "the fact that there is a maximum value for @xmath126 together with equation  ( [ eq : rpb ] ) implies that @xmath133 also has a maximum for a given @xmath43 and @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : blendrp]c shows @xmath138 as a function of transit shape parameterized by @xmath43 . in the presence of a blend , the actual radius of the eclipsing companion is always larger than the radius derived from the eclipsing light curve .",
    "thus this figure shows the importance of ruling out blends_the eclipsing companion in a blended case could be larger than expected for a close - in planet ( @xmath139 ) by 2050%_.      transits with short ingress and egress times ( box - shaped transits with large @xmath43 ) are least likely to be affected by blended stars and can be the best planet transit candidates for follow - up radial velocity mass measurements .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , less blended light can be hidden in a shallow transit with large @xmath43 than one with small @xmath43 .",
    "this is seen directly from the maximum value of @xmath140 given in equation  ( [ eq : maxblenddepth ] ) and shown in figure  [ fig : blendrp]a .",
    "the second reason why box - shaped transits are least likely to be affected by blended stars is because of the geometric probability for different transit shapes given random orientations of orbital inclinations .",
    "first it is useful to recognize that the unique solution to the planet - star parameters is in part possible because for a given @xmath17 there is a one - to - one correspondence between the impact parameter @xmath34 and the transit shape as parameterized by @xmath43 .",
    "this @xmath34 vs. @xmath43 relation is non linear , as shown in figure  [ fig : bvstf ] . for a random orientation of orbital inclinations , the cumulative probability @xmath141 that an unblended transit will have impact parameter @xmath34 _ smaller _ than some given value",
    "@xmath142 is proportional to @xmath142 ; the maximum value of @xmath34 for a transit is @xmath143 , where @xmath44 is the value for an unblended transit .",
    "thus , the cumulative probability that an unblended transit will have @xmath34 _ larger _ than @xmath142 is described by @xmath144 and is shown in figure  [ fig : probplanet]a .",
    "because of the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath34 and transit shape , we can also express the cumulative probability in terms of @xmath43 ( i.e. , transit shape ) , shown in figure  [ fig : probplanet]b . the cumulative probability in equation  ( [ eq : pc ] ) and",
    "figure  [ fig : probplanet ] can be used to show that for an ensemble of transits , there should be more `` box - shaped '' transits ( large @xmath145 ) than transits with very long ingress / egress times ( small @xmath43 ) .",
    "the s / n that must be reached to be able to completely rule out a possible blend can be determined from the maximum real eclipse depth @xmath146 .",
    "the light from the eclipsing primary star is always less than or equal to the total amount of light from the blended system , and has a minimum value given by the maximum blend : @xmath147 thus , the quantity @xmath148 gives a lower limit to the fraction of the observed light which comes from the primary star in the eclipsing system .",
    "this can be used to establish the data quality necessary to find or rule out a blend in a given case .",
    "the light from the eclipsing primary in the blend could be detected , for example , by cross - correlating spectra of the blend with a suite of stellar templates to see if two cross - correlation peaks are present , or by resolving the blend with high spatial resolution imaging ( e.g. , from space or adaptive optics ) .    to summarize this subsection : + @xmath10 box - shaped transits are the best planet candidates for radial velocity mass follow - up because ( 1 ) the least amount of blended light can be hidden in box - shaped transits and ( 2 ) for an ensemble of randomly oriented orbital inclinations",
    "there should be many more box - shaped transits with large @xmath43 than transits with small @xmath43 .",
    "+ @xmath10 in the presence of a blended star , the real planet radius is always larger than the naively derived planet radius ignoring the blend .",
    "+ @xmath10 the maximum brightness of a possible contaminating star can be derived from the transit light curve .      knowing the spectral type independently of the parameters derived from the transit light curve can be extremely useful in ruling out blends . with @xmath29 and @xmath30 determined from a spectral type , the system of equations  ( [ eq : depthorig])([eq : keplerorig ] ) is overconstrained .",
    "if the stellar density @xmath128 as derived from the light curve from equation  ( [ eq : rhoorig ] ) is very different from the density @xmath149 of the observed spectral type then something is amiss with the light curve assumptions in  [ sec - assumptions ] .",
    "a possibility is the case of a blended star discussed above . thus comparing @xmath150 with @xmath149",
    "is extremely useful for detecting the presence of a blend .",
    "for example the density can be overestimated a factor of up to 10 for @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the maximum density ratios on figure  [ fig : rhovssp]b can be compared directly with the actual stellar main sequence densities shown in figure  [ fig : rhovsmass ] .",
    "furthermore , by comparing @xmath150 and @xmath149 we can detect the presence of a blend to an upper limit determined by the fractional errors in the stellar density , @xmath153 . from equations  ( [ eq : primtot ] ) and ( [ eq : blendlimit ] ) we can see that it will be possible to detect blends with @xmath154 . note that the error in @xmath149 must account for the fact that the spectrum may be dominated by the blended star , rather than by the primary star in the eclipsing system .",
    "blended stars may be a common contaminant in transit searches ( d. latham , private communication 2001 ; malln - ornelas et al .",
    ", in preparation ) either due to very wide binaries or ,",
    "less likely in an uncrowded field , due to a chance alignment of a foreground or a background field star . in the presence of a third fully blended star",
    "some planet transits will be `` washed out '' and not detectable .",
    "hence it is important to know the blend frequency to determine the frequency of transiting planets . even without a measured stellar spectral type",
    ", the frequency of blends contaminating the sample of planet candidates can be determined statistically by considering all of the flat - bottomed eclipses of various depths in the following way . assuming the orbital inclination distribution is uniform , for a given @xmath17 light curves should have a certain distribution of @xmath43 ( see the probability discussion in  [ sec - blendslc ] ) .",
    "deviations from each expected distribution can be explained by eclipses being made more shallow than they should be by contaminating blended stars .",
    "the fraction of blended stars will also allow a statistical estimate of how many transits may be missed due to blends .      the period can be estimated for a light curve with only one transit if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are known from a measured spectral type .",
    "again , this is because the system of equations  ( [ eq : depthorig])([eq : keplerorig ] ) that describe the transit light curve are overconstrained when @xmath6 and @xmath7 are known .",
    "considering that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are known , and that the impact parameter is derived from equation  ( [ eq : borig ] ) , the period can be solved for from the following function of p : @xmath155^{3/2 } = \\frac{\\mstar}{\\rstar^3},\\ ] ] where the right hand side can be determined from the stellar spectral type . under the approximation @xmath57",
    "the period is simply given by @xmath156 for @xmath16 in days , the first term on the right hand side is @xmath157 .",
    "the error for this @xmath16 estimate is not easily derived because the errors in @xmath15 and @xmath14 are highly non - gaussian and are often correlated . the fractional error in the period , @xmath158 ,",
    "can be estimated for small errors in time sampling and photometric precision by noting that equation  ( [ eq : papprox ] ) is derived from the simplified equation for @xmath38 ( equation  ( [ eq : rhoapprox ] ) ) , and that @xmath29 and @xmath30 would be known from the spectral type .",
    "@xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the fractional error in @xmath38 derived from the transit light curve and @xmath161 is the fractional error in @xmath38 derived from the spectral type .",
    "thus , following the discussion in  [ sec - errors ] and assuming @xmath162 , the period can be determined to @xmath163 1520% ( depending on transit shape ) for @xmath164 minutes and @xmath165  mag .",
    "an upper limit to the period can be estimated even without knowing @xmath15 , @xmath166 this upper limit is valid even in the case of a blend where @xmath126 is larger than the observed @xmath17 .",
    "we have presented the equations that describe a light curve with two or more transits and have presented the unique solution for the impact parameter @xmath34 , the ratio of the orbital distance to stellar radius @xmath39 , and stellar density @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , with the stellar mass - radius relation we can uniquely derive the five parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath31 .",
    "this unique solution is only possible under the assumptions listed in  2 , most importantly that the light curve is from a single star ( i.e. not two or more fully blended stars ) , that the planet is dark and is in a circular orbit , and the light curve transits have flat bottoms ( which can be obtained at red or longer wavelengths ) .",
    "we have found : + @xmath10 a simple analytical solution that can be used to quickly estimate the planet - star parameters , most importantly @xmath38 and @xmath31 ; + @xmath10 the stellar density can be uniquely determined from the transit light curve alone .",
    "fitting codes that solve for star - planet parameters will find a number of best fits for different combinations of @xmath29 and @xmath30these best fits will have the same stellar density .",
    "+ @xmath10 for noisy data , the impact parameter @xmath34 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are underestimated and @xmath38 is overestimated due to a non - linear one - to - one correspondence for a given @xmath17 between @xmath34 and transit shape ( as parameterized by @xmath43 ) .",
    "the existence of the unique solution for the above parameters allows several interesting applications , including : + @xmath10 the stellar radius and the planet radius can be estimated based on @xmath38 ; + @xmath10 the likelihood that a shallow transit is due to contamination from a fully blended star can be estimated  with box - shaped transits being the least likely to be contaminated by blends ; + @xmath10 a comparison of @xmath38 as determined from the transit light curve with @xmath38 from a spectral type can help identify blended stars and hence indicate that shallow eclipses are not due to planet transits ; + @xmath10 in the presence of a blend the actual eclipsing companion radius is always larger than the radius derived from the light curve ; + @xmath10 the period from a single transit event can be estimated with a known spectral type .",
    "+ for most of these applications time sampling of @xmath164 minutes and photometric precision of @xmath167  mag are needed ( or more generally @xmath168mag@xmath169min ) . this time sampling and photometric precision",
    "is reachable with current planet transit surveys ( e.g. , malln - ornelas et al .",
    "the transit shape must be well defined by high photometric precision and high time sampling because most star - planet parameters depend on transit shape .",
