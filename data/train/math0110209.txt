    "our starting point is the following problem , which first appeared in the 1962 chinese mathematical olympiad @xcite .",

    "prove that there exists a circle which has 3 points of @xmath0 on its circumference , @xmath2 points in its interior , and @xmath2 in its exterior .",
    "following @xcite , we call such a circle _ point - splitting _ for the given set of points . for the rest of sections 1 and 2 , @xmath0 denotes an arbitrary set of @xmath1 points in general position in the plane , where @xmath4 is a fixed integer .",
    "there are several solutions to problem 1.1 .",
    "perhaps the easiest one is the following .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two consecutive vertices of the convex hull of @xmath0 .",
    "we claim that some circle going through @xmath5 and @xmath6 is point - splitting .",
    "all circles through @xmath5 and @xmath6 have their centers on the perpendicular bisector @xmath7 of the segment @xmath8 .",
    "pick a point @xmath9 on @xmath7 which lies on the same side of @xmath8 as @xmath0 , and is so far away from @xmath8 that the circle @xmath10 with center @xmath9 and going through @xmath5 and @xmath6 completely contains @xmath0 .",
    "this can clearly be done . now slowly ",
    "push \" @xmath9 along @xmath7 , moving it towards @xmath8 .",
    "the circle @xmath10 will change continuously with @xmath9 . as we do this",
    ", @xmath10 will stop containing some points of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , it will lose the points of @xmath0 one at a time : if it lost @xmath11 and @xmath12 simultaneously , then points @xmath13 and @xmath6 would be concyclic .",
    "we can move @xmath9 so far away past @xmath8 that , in the end , the circle will not contain any points of @xmath0 .",
    "originally , @xmath10 contained all the points of @xmath0 .",
    "now , as it loses one point of @xmath0 at a time , we can decide how many points we want it to contain .",
    "in particular , if we stop moving @xmath9 when the circle is about to lose the @xmath4-th point @xmath11 of @xmath0 , then the resulting @xmath10 will be point - splitting : it will have @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath11 on its circumference , @xmath2 points inside it , and @xmath2 outside it , as shown in figure 1 .     and @xmath11,width=240 ]",
    "the above proof hints that any set @xmath0 has several different point - splitting circles .",
    "we can certainly construct one for each pair of consecutive vertices of the convex hull of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the argument above can be modified to show that , for * any * two points of @xmath0 we can find a point - splitting circle going through them .",
    "the reader might find it instructive to work out a proof .",
    "this suggests that we ask the following question .",
    "what can we say about the number @xmath14 of point - splitting circles of @xmath0 ? at first sight , it seems that we really can not say very much about this number .",
    "point - splitting circles seem hard to  control \" , and harder to count",
    ".    we should be able to find upper and lower bounds for @xmath14 in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "right away we know that @xmath15 , since we can find a point - splitting circle for each pair of points of @xmath0 , and each such circle is counted by three different pairs .",
    "computing an upper bound seems more difficult .",
    "if we fix points @xmath5 and @xmath6 of @xmath0 , it is indeed possible that all @xmath16 circles through @xmath5 , @xmath6 and another point of @xmath0 are point - splitting .",
    "the reader is invited to check this .",
    "this is not likely to happen very often in a set @xmath0 , and we can get _ some _ upper bound out of this .",
    "however , it is hard to make this precise and get a non - trivial upper bound .",
    "when @xmath0 consists of 5 points , the situation is simple enough that we can actually show that @xmath17 always .",
    "this was done in @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed , but not chosen , as a problem for the 1999 international mathematical olympiad .",
    "notice that our lower bound above gives @xmath18 .    in a different direction ,",
    "problem 5 of the 1998 asian - pacific mathematical olympiad , proposed by the author , stated the following .",
    "* proposition 1.2 .",
    "* @xmath14 has the same parity as @xmath4 .",
    "this result follows easily from the nontrivial observation that , for any @xmath5 and @xmath6 in @xmath0 , the number of point - splitting circles that go through @xmath5 and @xmath6 is odd .",
    "the following result brings together the above considerations .",
    "* theorem 1.3 . *",
    "any set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points in the plane in general position has exactly @xmath3 point - splitting circles .",
    "theorem 1.3 is the main result of this paper . in section 2",
    "we prove that every set of @xmath1 points in the plane in general position has the same number of point - splitting circles . in section 3",
    "we prove that this number is exactly @xmath3 . in section 4",
    "we present some questions that arise from our work .",
    "at this point , we could go ahead and prove the very counterintuitive theorem 1.3 , suppressing the motivation behind its discovery . with the risk of making the argument seem longer , we believe that it is worthwhile to present a natural way of realizing and proving that the number of point - splitting circles of @xmath0 depends only on @xmath4 . therefore , we ask the reader to forget momentarily the punchline of this article .",
    "suppose that we are trying to find out whatever we can about the number @xmath14 . as mentioned in section 1",
    ", this number does not seem very tractable and it is not clear how much we can say about it . being optimistic , we can hope to be able to answer the following two questions .    *",
    "question 2.1*. what are the sharp lower and upper bounds @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath14 ?    * question 2.2*. what are all the values that @xmath14 takes in the interval @xmath21 $ ] ?",
    "question 2.1 seems considerably difficult . to answer it completely",
    ", we would first need to prove an inequality @xmath22 , and then construct suitable sets @xmath23 and @xmath24 which achieve these bounds . to see how difficult this is ,",
    "the reader is invited to try to construct _ any _ set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points for which the number @xmath14 can be easily computed .    at this point question 2.1",
    "seems very hard , so let us focus on question 2.2 instead",
    ". here is a first approach .",
    "intuitively , since the set @xmath0 can be transformed continuously , we should expect the value of @xmath14 to change  continuously \" with it .",
    "suppose we start with the set @xmath23 ( with @xmath25 ) and move its points continuously so that we end up with @xmath24 ( with @xmath26 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath14 should change  continuously \" as @xmath0 changes continuously . by ",
    "continuity \" we would guess that @xmath14 sweeps all the integers between @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath0 changes from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "right away , we know that this is not entirely true . by proposition 1.2 we know that the parity of @xmath14 is determined by @xmath4 , so @xmath14 will not sweep * all * the integers between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is not too surprising , since we havent made precise the meaning of the statement that the value of @xmath14 should change  continuously \" as @xmath0 changes continuously .",
    "the above guess assumed that the value of @xmath14 can only jump by 1 as @xmath0 is transformed continuously .",
    "( that is , if we have a set with @xmath29 point - splitting circles and we deform it continuously into a set with @xmath30 point - splitting circles , then somewhere in the middle we must have had a set with @xmath31 point - splitting circles . ) we have no reason to assume that .",
    "we can still hope that , as @xmath0 changes , @xmath14 sweeps all the integers * of the right parity * between @xmath27 and @xmath28 . to show this",
    ", we would have to show that the value of @xmath14 can only jump by 2 as @xmath0 is transformed continuously .",
    "this is a reasonable statement which we can try to prove .    in any case",
    ", the natural question to ask is what kind of  continuity \" the value of @xmath14 satisfies as @xmath0 changes continuously .",
    "we certainly expect that if two sets @xmath0 and @xmath32 look very very much alike , then the difference @xmath33 should be small .",
    "we have to find a way to make this statement precise .",
    "suppose we have sets @xmath34 and @xmath35 that achieve the upper and lower bounds for @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "now slowly transform @xmath23 into @xmath24 : first send @xmath36 to @xmath37 continously along some path , then send @xmath38 to @xmath39 continuously along some other path , and so on .",
    "we can think of our set @xmath0 as changing with time . at the initial time",
    "@xmath40 , our set is @xmath41 . at the final time @xmath42 ,",
    "our set is @xmath43 . in between",
    ", @xmath44 varies continously with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "how does @xmath46 vary  continuously \" with time ?",
    "how small can we make @xmath47 for small enough @xmath48 ?",
    "this is the question we need to ask .    *",
    "technical remark . * as we move from @xmath49 to @xmath50 continuously , it is likely that several intermediate sets @xmath44 , with @xmath51 , are not in general position . strictly speaking",
    ", we should only consider those times @xmath45 when @xmath44 is in general position ; when @xmath44 is not in general position , we should decree that @xmath44 is undefined , and have a discontinuity at @xmath45 .",
    "we shall see that we can go from @xmath49 to @xmath50 with only finitely many such discontinuous points .",
    "at such a discontinuity @xmath45 , we still need to know how small we can make @xmath52 for small @xmath48 .    for small enough @xmath48 ,",
    "the set @xmath53 is a very slight deformation of @xmath44 .",
    "what is missing is an understanding of what can make @xmath14 change as the set @xmath0 changes very slightly from @xmath44 to @xmath54 , and how small this change is .",
    "let us answer this question .",
    "notice that , in the way we defined the deformation from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , the points of @xmath0 moved only one at a time .",
    "let us focus for now on the interval of time where @xmath36 moves towards @xmath37 .",
    "suppose that the number @xmath14 changes between time @xmath45 and time @xmath55 . then it must be the case that for some @xmath56 and @xmath57 the circle @xmath58 contained ( or did not contain ) point @xmath59 at time @xmath45 , but at time @xmath55 it does not ( or does ) contain it . for this to be true",
    ", it must have happened that somewhere between times @xmath45 and @xmath55 , these four points must have been concyclic , or three of them must have been collinear . since @xmath36 is the only point that has moved , we can conclude that @xmath36 must have crossed a circle or a line determined by the other points ; this is what caused @xmath14 to change .",
    "we will call the circles and lines determined by the points @xmath60 the _",
    "boundaries_.    we can choose the path along which @xmath36 is going to move towards @xmath37 . to make things easier",
    ", we may assume that @xmath36 never crosses two of the boundaries at the same time .",
    "this can clearly be guaranteed : we know that these boundaries intersect pairwise in finitely many points , and all we have to do is avoid these intersection points in the path from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "we can also assume that @xmath48 is small enough that @xmath36 crosses exactly one boundary between times @xmath45 and @xmath61 .",
    "let us see how @xmath14 changes in this time interval",
    ".    it will be convenient to call a circle @xmath58 _ @xmath62-splitting _ ( where @xmath63 ) if it has @xmath64 points of @xmath0 inside it and the remaining @xmath65 outside it .",
    "for example , an @xmath66-splitting circle is just a point - splitting circle .",
    "crosses line @xmath67.,width=288 ]    first assume that @xmath36 crosses line @xmath67 , going from position @xmath68 to position @xmath69 . from the remarks made above , we know that only circle @xmath70 can change the value of @xmath14 by becoming or ceasing to be point- splitting .",
    "assume that circle @xmath71 was @xmath62-splitting .",
    "since @xmath36 only crossed the boundary @xmath67 when going from @xmath5 to @xmath6 , the region common to circles @xmath71 and @xmath72 can not contain any points of @xmath0 , as indicated in figure 2 .",
    "the region outside of both circles can not contain points of @xmath0 either . for circle @xmath71 to",
    "be @xmath62-splitting , the other two regions must then contain @xmath64 and @xmath65 points respectively , as shown .",
    "therefore , circle @xmath72 is @xmath73-splitting .",
    "it follows that @xmath71 was point - splitting if and only if @xmath72 is point - splitting ( if and only if @xmath74 ) .",
    "we conclude that the value of @xmath14 does nt change when @xmath36 crosses a line determined by the other points ; it can only change when @xmath36 crosses a circle .",
    "now assume that @xmath36 crosses circle @xmath58 , going from position @xmath68 inside the circle to position @xmath75 outside it .",
    "( the other case , when @xmath36 moves inside the circle , is analogous . )",
    "we can assume that @xmath36 crossed the arc @xmath67 of the circle that does nt contain point @xmath76 .",
    "notice that @xmath5 must be outside triangle @xmath58 if we want @xmath36 to cross only one boundary in the time interval considered .",
    "assume that circle @xmath71 was @xmath62-splitting .",
    "as before , we know that the only regions of figure 3 containing points of @xmath0 are the one common to circles @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and the one outside both of them .",
    "they must contain @xmath77 and @xmath65 points respectively , for circle @xmath71 to be @xmath62-splitting . in this case",
    ", the value of @xmath14 can change only by circles @xmath58 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath70 becoming or ceasing to be point - splitting .",
    "it is clear that circle @xmath58 went from being @xmath62-splitting to being @xmath80-splitting . the same is true of circle @xmath70 .",
    "crosses circle @xmath58.,width=384 ]    it is also not hard to see , by a similar argument , that circles @xmath78 and @xmath79 both went from being @xmath80-splitting to being @xmath62-splitting . again",
    ", the key assumption is that @xmath36 only crossed the boundary @xmath58 in this time interval .",
    "so , by having @xmath36 cross circle @xmath58 , we have traded two @xmath62-splitting and two @xmath80-splitting circles for two @xmath80-splitting and two @xmath62-splitting circles , respectively .",
    "it follows that the number @xmath14 of point - splitting circles remains constant when @xmath36 crosses a circle @xmath58 also .",
    "we had shown that , as we moved @xmath36 to @xmath37 , @xmath14 could only possibly change in a time interval when @xmath36 crossed a boundary determined by the other points .",
    "but now we see that , even in such a time interval , @xmath14 does not change !",
    "therefore moving @xmath36 to @xmath37 does nt change the value of @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , moving @xmath81 to @xmath82 does nt change @xmath14 either , for any @xmath83 .",
    "it follows that @xmath14 is the same for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , @xmath14 is the same for any set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points in general position !",
    "now that we know that the number @xmath14 depends only on the number of points in @xmath0 , define @xmath85 to be the number of point - splitting circles for a set of @xmath1 points in general position .",
    "we compute @xmath85 recursively .",
    "construct a set @xmath0 of @xmath1 points as follows .",
    "first consider the vertices of a regular @xmath16-gon with center @xmath9 .",
    "now move them very slightly to positions @xmath86 so that they are in general position",
    ". the difference will be so slight that all the lines @xmath87 still split the remaining points into two sets of equal size , and all the circles @xmath58 still contain @xmath9 .",
    "also consider a point @xmath12 which is so far away from the others that it lies outside of all the circles formed by the points considered so far .",
    "of course , we need @xmath12 to be in general position with respect to the remaining points .",
    "let us count the number of point - splitting circles of @xmath88 .",
    "first consider the circles of the form @xmath58 .",
    "these circles contain @xmath9 and do nt contain @xmath12 ; so they are point - splitting for @xmath0 if and only if they are point - splitting for @xmath89 .",
    "thus there are @xmath90 such circles .",
    "next consider the circles @xmath91 .",
    "it is clear that these circles contain at most @xmath92 other @xmath76 s .",
    "they do not contain @xmath12 , so they contain at most @xmath92 points , and they are not point - splitting .",
    "finally consider the circles that go through @xmath12 and two other points @xmath93 and @xmath94 of @xmath0 .",
    "circle @xmath95 splits the remaining points in the same way that line @xmath96 does .",
    "more specifically , circle @xmath95 contains a point @xmath11 of @xmath0 if and only if @xmath11 is on the same side of line @xmath96 that @xmath12 is .",
    "this follows easily from the fact that @xmath12 lies outside circle @xmath97 .",
    "therefore we have to determine how many lines determined by two of the points of @xmath98 split the remaining points of this set into two sets of @xmath2 points each .",
    "this question is much easier ; it is clear from our construction that the lines @xmath87 do this and the lines @xmath67 do not .",
    "it follows that the @xmath16 circles @xmath99 are point - splitting , and the circles @xmath100 are not .",
    "summarizing , the point - splitting circles of @xmath0 are the @xmath90 point - splitting circles of @xmath101 and the @xmath16 circles @xmath99 .",
    "therefore @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath103 , it follows inductively that @xmath104 this completes the proof of theorem 1.3 .",
    "* theorem 3.1 . * consider a set of @xmath1 points in general position in the plane , and two non - negative integers @xmath105 such that @xmath106 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath107 circles which are either @xmath62-splitting or @xmath73-splitting for the set of points .",
    "_ sketch of proof . _",
    "the argument of section 2 carries directly to this situation , to show that the number of circles in consideration , which we denote @xmath108 , only depends on @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore it suffices to compute it recursively , using the set @xmath0 above .",
    "it is essential in the proof that @xmath109 .    just as above , there are @xmath110 such circles among the circles @xmath58 . among the @xmath91",
    "there are exactly @xmath16 such circles , namely the circles @xmath111 ( taking subscripts modulo @xmath16 ) .",
    "there are also @xmath16 such circles among the @xmath112 , namely the circles @xmath113 .",
    "finally , there are no such circles among the @xmath99 . therefore @xmath114 .    repeating the above argument for @xmath115",
    ", we get that @xmath116 .",
    "if we combine this and the recursive relation obtained , theorem 3.1 follows by induction .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that theorems 1.3 and 3.1 are closely related to a beautiful result of d.t .",
    "lee , which gives a sharp bound for the number of vertices of an order @xmath117 voronoi diagram .",
    "the connection is obtained if we embed our set @xmath0 of points on the surface of a sphere .",
    "then the point - splitting circles of @xmath0 are put in correspondence with the  point - splitting planes \" of a three - dimensional convex polytope with @xmath1 vertices .",
    "these are known to be related to voronoi diagrams .",
    "see @xcite for more details on this , and a proof of a result essentially equivalent to theorems 1.3 and 3.1 .",
    "our work completely determines the number of point - splitting circles , as well as the total number of @xmath62-splitting and @xmath73-splitting circles for a set of points in general position in the plane .",
    "however , we know very little about these numbers for sets of points that are not in general position .",
    "the situation here is much more subtle .",
    "for example , the number of point - splitting circles of a set @xmath0 is not uniquely determined by the subsets of @xmath0 which are concyclic .",
    "consider the following example .",
    "let @xmath118 and @xmath119 be the two sets of seven points shown in figure 4 .",
    "both of them are almost in general position ; the only exception is that , for each of the two sets , there is a circle going through four points of the set . in @xmath118 ,",
    "this circle @xmath120 contains exactly one point of @xmath118 inside it . in @xmath119 ,",
    "this circle @xmath121 contains no points of @xmath119 inside it . in analogy with theorem 1.3 , where it did not matter which points were inside which circles",
    ", we might hope that @xmath118 and @xmath119 have the same number of point - splitting circles .     and",
    "@xmath122.,width=384 ]    unfortunately this is not the case .",
    "if we move @xmath123 or @xmath124 very slightly to put @xmath118 in general position , the resulting set will have @xmath125 point - splitting circles by theorem 1.3 .",
    "it is easy to see that exactly two of @xmath126 and @xmath127 are among these circles .",
    "when we deform the set back to @xmath118 , these @xmath125 circles will still be point - splitting , but two of them will deform into @xmath120 .",
    "so @xmath118 has @xmath128 point - splitting circles .",
    "similarly , if we move @xmath129 or @xmath130 very slightly to put @xmath119 in general position , the resulting set will have @xmath125 point - splitting circles .",
    "but now we can see that when we deform the set back to @xmath119 , none of these circles will deform into @xmath121 , because @xmath121 contains no points of @xmath119 .",
    "therefore @xmath119 has @xmath125 point - splitting circles .",
    "even if the number of point - splitting circles is not constant , we might be able to say something about it .",
    "as a small example , consider all sets of seven points which are almost in general position , except that four of them are concyclic .",
    "it is possible to show , by an argument similar to the above , that such a set can only have @xmath128 or @xmath125 point - splitting circles .",
    "it seems reasonable that , in general , one might be able to define some measure of how far a set @xmath0 is from being in general position , and to obtain bounds for @xmath14 in terms of that measure .",
    "the results in this article were first presented by the author at dan kleitman s 65th birthday conference at the massachusetts institute of technology in 1999 . the author wishes to thank dan kleitman and richard stanley for useful discussions on this subject during the conference .",
    "he also wishes to thank timothy chow , who took an interest in this result and mentioned it to several people .",
    "it is due to his efforts that the author became aware of the equivalent result in @xcite and the connection with voronoi diagrams ."
