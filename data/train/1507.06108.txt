    "as shown in fig . [ fig1](a ) , an nv center , composed of a substitutional nitrogen atom and an adjacent vacancy in diamond lattice , is coupled to an mtr with a wgm .",

    "the optical transition is allowed between the ground state @xmath4 and the excited state @xmath10 owing to the total angular momentum conservation @xcite .",

    "the average readout fidelity of the nv electron spins is @xmath111 @xcite . by using isotopically purified diamonds and polarizing the nitrogen nuclear spin",
    ", we can reduce the microwave manipulation imperfection .",
    "the spin decoherence may also reduce the fidelity of our schemes . in our schemes , the single photons",
    "are successively sent into the devices , the time interval @xmath61 between two photons should be less than the electron - spin coherence time @xmath62 . in experimental cases ,",
    "the spin relaxation time @xmath112 of nv centers in diamond scales from microseconds to seconds at low temperature and the dephasing time @xmath113 is about 2 ms in an isotopically pure diamond @xcite .",
    "the electron - spin coherence time @xmath62 is @xmath114 ms @xcite , which is much longer than the photon coherence time @xmath115 ns and the subnanosecond electron - spin manipulation control @xcite .    for the practical operations , the photon loss due to absorption and scatting , the mismatch between the input pulse mode and mtr , and the inefficiency of the detectors will bring ineffectiveness to our schemes . interestingly",
    ", the photon loss will just affect the success efficiency , rather than the fidelity .",
    "the present experimental technology can generate 300000 high - quality single photons within 30 s @xcite .",
    "another key ingredient of our protocols is the coupling between nv centers and mtrs . in realistic experiments , the strong coupling between the nv centers and the wgm has been demonstrated in different kinds of microcavities @xcite .",
    "the coupling strength between nv centers and the wgm can reach @xmath116ghz @xcite .",

    "relax the difficulty of their implementation in experiment as it is not difficult to generate the @xmath0 phase shift in single - sided nv - cavity systems .",
    "moreover , single - sided nv - cavity systems have a long coherence time even at the room temperature ( 1.8 ms ) @xcite , different from quantum - dot - cavity systems . the first hbsa scheme by sheng , deng , and long @xcite is achieved with cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "it is perfect in theory . at present , a clean cross - kerr nonlinearity in the optical single - photon regime is still a controversial assumption with current technology @xcite . the second hbsa scheme by ren _",
    "@xcite with single - sided quantum - dot - cavity systems requires the @xmath0 phase difference of the faraday rotation between a hot cavity and an empty cavity , and it is not easy to acquire the phase difference with only one nonlinear interaction between a photon and a quantum dot .",
    "compared with the work by wang , lu , and long @xcite , our schemes do not require that the transmission for the uncoupled cavity is balanceable with the reflectance for the coupled cavity .",
    "moreover , the coherent manipulation of the spin of a single nv center to accomplish quantum information and computation tasks at room temperature has been presented @xcite , which provides the basis for the current schemes .    in summary ,",
