    "gas and dust in disk galaxies are intimately linked to almost all aspects of their evolution , dynamics , and appearance .",
    "for example , the interstellar medium ( ism ) influences star formation and evolution , while these processes in turn have an effect on the distribution and turbulence of the ism .",
    "one of the most important links is that between the molecular clouds , which provide the fuel for star formation , and the location and rate of star formation .",
    "however the underlying physical process that drives this relation is still poorly understood @xcite .",
    "a recent detailed study by @xcite , using the high resolution hi maps from things @xcite , found that many of the commonly used prescriptions do not predict the star formation well .",
    "all _ components of the ism across a wide variety of galaxies can lead to a greater understanding of the physics of the star formation process , its dependence on the properties of the host galaxy s ism , the evolution of galaxies , and the distribution of dark matter .",
    "one of the limiting factors in understanding the physics of star formation is our ability to trace the molecular gas clouds within galaxies .",
    "much work has been done recently to examine the molecular gas within individual and small samples of nearby galaxies using various molecular transition lines that trace different gas densities and temperatures .",
    "the most extensive observations thus far have used the millimeter @xmath0co@xmath1=1 - 0 transition to map molecular gas , including large surveys of nearby galaxies with single - dish telescopes and interferometers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this transition is most sensitive to cold , lower density molecular gas , which does not appear to trace star formation on a one - to - one basis @xcite .",
    "recent studies such as @xcite have found that higher order transitions such as the @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 line more closely follow global star formation , nearly linearly over five orders of magnitude .",
    "the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) is a 15  meter single dish submillimeter telescope operated by the joint astronomy centre ( jac ) on mauna kea , hawaii , which after a recent major upgrade is undertaking the jcmt legacy survey ( jls ) a series of seven surveys from planetary to cosmological scales .",
    "one of these , the jcmt nearby galaxies legacy survey ( ngls ) , is the first large submillimeter survey of nearby galaxies at @xmath215 spatial resolution . taking advantage of new instrumentation on the jcmt",

    "the ngls data set will be a powerful tool for studying the physics of the dusty ism in galaxies as well as the interplay between star formation and the ism . with a large , well - selected sample , we will be able to search for variations in the physical properties of the ism as a function of galaxy type , metallicity , star formation rate , mass , and environment . by having limited our sample galaxies to distances closer than 25  mpc",

    "as with the other ancillary data , we convolved the hi intensity ( 0th moment ) maps to match the jcmt resolution .    unlike the hi intensity maps , we can not directly convolve the beams of the velocity fields ( 1st moment ) and velocity dispersion ( 2nd moment ) maps from the things survey for comparison to our @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 moment maps .",
    "so instead , we obtained the naturally weighted things hi data cubes for the three galaxies , convolved the cubes to a 145 circular beam , and then created moment maps from the resulting cubes ( using a similar procedure to the creation of the @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 maps ) .",
    "while this also produced 0th moment maps , we prefer to use the convolved version of the things maps in this case as their moment map production procedure has been refined for their data set .",

    "[ fig : ngc0628]d shows the @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 velocity dispersion map ( moment 2 map ) for ngc628 .",

    "the median velocity dispersion is 3.2  kms@xmath15 .",
    "these velocity dispersions are similar to the internal velocity dispersions seen in giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) in the milky way @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the main contribution to velocity dispersion in the molecular gas for ngc628 is internal dispersion within gmcs , rather than inter - cloud velocity differences .",
    "alternatively , @xcite also looked at the velocity dispersion of molecular gas in this galaxy , using iram 30  m telescope observations at @xmath0co@xmath1=1 - 0 and @xmath0co@xmath1=2 - 1 ( 23 and 12 resolution , respectively ) , and finding a near constant velocity dispersion as a function of radius of @xmath26  kms@xmath15 they conclude that cloud - cloud velocity dispersions dominate over internal dispersions . without resolving the clouds themselves",
    "however we can not tell for certain which components contribute most to the velocity dispersion measured within our beam .",
    "we would expect contributions from the rotation velocity gradient across our beam to be minimal beyond the center of the galaxy given the low inclination .",
    "the integrated @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 intensity maps for ngc3521 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ngc3521]a , b ) show that its molecular gas is concentrated towards the inner regions of the optical disk , with a slight central dip forming a torus - like structure in the inner @xmath21 ( @xmath23  kpc along the major axis ) .",
    "the high inclination angle of the galaxy makes it difficult to identify other structures within the molecular gas disk .",
    "the detected @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 disk extends along the major axis out to a radius of @xmath2130 , or @xmath26.7  kpc , which is about one third of the optical radius @xmath24 .",
    "there are two peaks in the map on either side of the central dip ( @xmath2530 from the center along the major axis in both directions ) that are of about equal intensity in our @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 data , with the northern peak at @xmath26  kkms@xmath15 and the southern at @xmath27  kkms@xmath15 .",

    "a brief examination of position - velocity slices through the cube for ngc3521 , along and parallel to the major axis , showed no significant detections of molecular gas with anomalous velocities , and that the rotation curve appears to flatten out within the radius of the disk detected in @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 .",

    "the ngls started taking science data using the 16 element harp - b array with the backend spectrometer acsis @xcite .",
    "since that time there has been approximately one dedicated jls run per month that the three surveys share .",
    "observations for the three galaxies we are examining here , ngc628 , ngc3521 , and ngc3627 , were taken over multiple jls runs between november 2007 and march 2008 .",
    "the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) is a 15  meter single dish submillimeter telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "it is currently the largest single dish submillimeter telescope in the world .",
    "harp - b is a 16-element sparsely filled array of heterodyne receptors operating in the submillimeter window centered at 850  @xmath3 m ( 350  ghz ) .",
    "the receptors are arranged in a 4@xmath574 pattern and separated by 30 , approximately two beam - widths ( @xmath2145 at this wavelength ) .",
    "see fig  [ fig : harp ] for the basic layout of the array ( with two receptors that were missing during observing marked ) . to produce a fully sampled map we need to set up a minimum schedulable block ( msb ) that either scans or jiggles the array around the field .",
    "for all three galaxies in this paper , which have fields larger than the array footprint of 2 , we used a raster scanning technique for mapping .",
    "the default harp - b raster scanning mode is to rotate the array by @xmath491404 to the scan axis and to scan along the long axis of the field , which produces scan rows at 72761 intervals . on the outer edges of the field coverage",
    "is sparse where half the array receptors start already within the target field , so we added an additional 60 to the start and end along the direction of the scan to account for this .",
    "there are significant variations in signal - to - noise between receptors in the array , which can produce striping in raster maps where different rows have different sensitivity . to reduce this effect and produce maps with more even sensitivity coverage we used a ` basket weave ' technique , scanning along both the major and minor axes of the field .",
    "additionally , we found in the science verification phase of the survey that missing and bad receptors in the array caused large variations in our completeness across the target field , and even holes in our coverage where missing / flagged scans crossed in the basket weave . to counter this problem ,",
    "we used a half - step scan method , only moving half an array step ( 582 ) between scan rows / columns . in this way , each position was covered by two receptors in both scan directions . however , using the half - step method does require that an additional 60 be added at either end _ perpendicular _ to the scan direction so that all points within the target field have the same integration time . with the previous addition of 60 along the scan axis",
    ", we are adding 60 around all four sides of the field for both scan directions .    each galaxy s msb was set up with a sample time per position of 2.5  seconds , so with the half - step basket weave pattern each pointing will have 10  seconds integration time per msb ( if none of the receptors that contribute to that pointing are flagged or missing ) .",
    "we repeated these msbs up to seven times until we reached the survey s target rms ( 19  mk after binning to 20  kms@xmath15 resolution ) .",
    "the backend spectrometer acsis was set up with a bandwidth of @xmath21  ghz and a resolution of 488.28 khz ( 0.423  kms@xmath15 at the frequency of the observations ) , centered at the systemic velocity for the galaxy being observed ( where the @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 line rest frequency is 345.79  ghz ) .",
    "appropriate pointing and calibration observations were taken during observing nights . individual setup and observing details for the three galaxies in this paper",
    "are in summarized table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "data reduction and most of the analysis were carried out with recent jac maintained versions of the starlink software collection ( initially the humu version , and later lehuakona ) .",
    "most of the starlink tasks we used in the reduction were in the kappa ( most reduction and analysis tasks ) and smurf ( cube making ) packages , with some tasks in cupid ( clump finding ) and convert ( file exporting ) also used .",
    "the visualization programs gaia and splat were used to inspect the raw and processed data .",
    "additionally , analysis tasks in miriad were used after the creation of cubes and moment maps .",
    "the general reduction procedure was to inspect the raw data files , flag poor data where necessary , combine the raw data into a cube , subtract a baseline from the cube , and collapse it into moment maps .",
    "details of these steps follow .    throughout the period that the survey observations were taken , the state of the 16 receptors in the array varied .",
    "two receptors ( h03 and h14 ) were unavailable for the duration of the project and for the most part were automatically flagged at the telescope , while several other receptors had various , mostly intermittent problems that led to bad baselines , spikes , and false lines .",
    "we used the task chpix ( kappa ) to flag such receptors where required .",
    "additionally , almost all scans contained a narrow interference spike that was also flagged .",
    "this spike occurred at the same frequency on all receptors ( with varying strength ) throughout a scan , and would remain at that frequency over the course of a night or even over several runs .",
    "some scans taken for ngc3521 were excluded when pointing observations taken straight after showed significant pointing errors ( @xmath485 ) , while all data for ngc628 taken on 11 january 2008 were excluded due to poor baselines and high noise on virtually all receptors .",
    "other observations that did not meet the survey quality assurance criteria ( such as high @xmath58 or many receptors with bad baselines ) were included , but often with heavy flagging of poor receptors .",
    "after flagging , the raw data were combined into cubes using the task makecube ( smurf ) .",
    "we produced cubes with 72761 pixels , and trimmed the velocity axis to the central @xmath2800  kms@xmath15 of the bandpass .",
    "we used a @xmath59 ( ` sincsinc ' ) kernel in makecube for the pixel weighting function .",
    "the resulting cube was then trimmed to remove the leading and trailing scan ends outside the target field where our scan coverage is incomplete . after removing a simple first order polynomial baseline ( fit to the line - free ends of the bandpass ) and binning to @xmath220  kms@xmath15",
    ", this cube was examined for further bad baselines and to check if we had reached our target depth for the survey . if necessary the process of flagging and cube making was repeated until we were satisfied that the poor baselines had been removed .    to produce a more accurate fit to the baseline level",
    ", we used a method in which we masked out emission in the cubes , and then fit third order polynomial baselines to the unmasked data . to make the baseline mask , we first smoothed the cube with a [ 3 pixel , 3 pixel , 25 channel ] box filter , and then used the task mfittrend ( kappa ) to make a mask of all of the features in the smoothed cube . in automatic mode , the ` method ' parameter in mfittrend allows the choice of several masking methods that have varying success at picking up broad and narrow line features . as the galaxies we are looking at contain a mixture of narrow and broad @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 lines , it was important to produce a mask that contains all emission features .",
    "individual methods can miss some emission , such as the default ` single ' method that picks up narrow lines well , but can often miss broad features . to produce a better mask , we combined the results of two of these methods , ` single ' and ` global ' ( which does a better job on broad lines , but picks up more noise especially at the line - free ends of the bandpass ) .",
    "we altered this combined mask to leave the line - free regions at the ends of the bandpass unmasked ( determined by considering the published width of the hi line and visual examination of the cube ) .",
    "additionally , for ngc3521 and ngc3627 , which have broad lines in their centers , we included a block mask over a small central region for the full width of the line so that only the line - free ends would be used for the baseline fit .",
    "the block mask for ngc3521 was split into overlapping northern and southern components that cover different velocity ranges .",
    "the final combined masks were applied to the original cube , and a third - order polynomial was fit to the masked cube to produce the baseline fit .",
    "these baselines were subtracted from the original cube to make the final baseline subtracted cube .",
    "moment maps of the galaxies were made from the baseline subtracted cubes using the starlink implementation of the clumpfind algorithm @xcite , the cupid task findclump , to identify emission above 3@xmath60 .",
    "sensitivity varied across the field , particularly in the regions outside the target field ( see above ) , so before running it through the moment map procedure we first scaled the cubes by the noise level in order to better identify real clumps . to do this , we produced a map of the standard deviation in the line - free channels of the cube ( using the baseline mask we previously made ) , and divided the cube by this map .",
    "this scaling was removed again after producing the maps so that the units were correct .",
    "as with the baseline mask steps , we made a smoothed cube with a [ 3,3,25 ] box filter . using the baseline mask previously made for the baseline fit , we calculated the rms in the line free regions of the cube .",
    "we then used findclump ( cupid ) on the smoothed cube to find all emission greater than 3@xmath60 , and create a mask to exclude the regions without emission .",
    "the clump mask was then applied to the original baseline subtracted cube , and the result was collapsed into two dimensional moment maps using collapse ( kappa ) .",
    "we produced maps of the integrated intensity ( moment 0 ) , the intensity weighted velocity co - ordinate ( moment 1 , the velocity field ) , and the intensity weighted dispersion ( moment 2 , the velocity dispersion ) .",
    "we converted the @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 data from corrected antenna temperature ( @xmath16 ) to the main beam temperature scale by dividing by @xmath17 .",
    "this correction is different from the value of 0.67 used in paper  i , and all @xmath0co@xmath1=3 - 2 measurements from that paper used here are corrected for this difference .",
