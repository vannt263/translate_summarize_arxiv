    "since the original discovery in 1995 , the subject of bose - einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases has become a major field of research  @xcite .",
    "even though these systems consist of a very dilute vapor , they exhibit robust collective oscillations which are strongly influenced by mean - field interactions and collisions between the atoms .",
    "there has been considerable theoretical work devoted to describing the collective modes of a trapped gas at very low temperatures in terms of the solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for the macroscopic wavefunction of the condensate . as discussed in several recent reviews @xcite",
    ", there is excellent agreement between experimental observations for @xmath0 and theoretical calculations based on the @xmath1 gp equation .",
    "at elevated temperatures where the condensate is appreciably depleted by thermal excitations , one enters a more complex regime in which collisions between the atoms must be considered .",
    "two limiting cases for the dynamics of the gas correspond to the collisionless and hydrodynamic regimes  @xcite . in the collisionless regime ,",
    "the main effect of the non - condensate component appears to be a shift in the collective mode frequencies as a result of the change in the condensate _ number _ , and to the appearance of landau damping .",
    "there have been several studies of this collisionless region in trapped gases where dynamic mean fields dominate the physics ( we refer to the review articles in ref .",
    "the second regime arises when collisions between atoms are rapid enough to establish a state of dynamic local equilibrium in the non - condensate gas .",
    "this collision - dominated hydrodynamic regime is the subject of this paper . to be in this regime the collective modes of frequency @xmath2",
    "must satisfy the condition @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is some appropriate relaxation time for reaching local equilibrium . as a rough estimate",
    ", we can take @xmath4 to be the collision time @xmath5 for a classical gas . here",
    "@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the low energy quantum mechanical cross - section for bosonic atoms and @xmath8 is the average thermal velocity  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a high density and/or a large atomic scattering cross - section are favorable for reaching the hydrodynamic region .",
    "experiments which can probe this region in trapped bose gases are now feasible and promise to provide much new physics .",
    "one finds in the hydrodynamic regime that the dynamics of the condensate and non - condensate components can _ both _ be described in terms of a few macroscopic ( coarse - grained ) variables ( such as the local densities and velocities of the two components ) .",
    "the coupled equations of motion for these local quantities will be referred to as the two - fluid hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the microscopic basis of these two - fluid equations rests on a generalized gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate atoms and a quantum kinetic equation for the non - condensate atoms .",
    "these two components are coupled through mean - field interactions as well as collisions between the atoms .",
    "the authors have recently given a detailed derivation and discussion of such a two - fluid hydrodynamics for trapped atomic gases at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "these equations were derived for temperatures where the dominant thermal excitations in the trap can be treated as atoms moving in a self - consistent hartree - fock field .",
    "in particular , the original zgn hydrodynamic equations derived in ref .",
    "@xcite were generalized in refs .",
    "@xcite to include collisions between condensate and non - condensate atoms .",
    "this allows for the possibility of treating the situation in which atoms of the non - condensate are in local thermodynamic equilibrium among themselves but are _ not _ in diffusive equilibrium with the condensate atoms .",
    "the resulting zgn@xmath9 hydrodynamic equations  @xcite involve a characteristic relaxation time @xmath10 which is the time scale on which local diffusive equilibrium is established .",
    "this equilibration process leads to a novel damping mechanism which is associated with the collisional exchange of atoms between the two components .",
    "the zgn@xmath9 equations are briefly reviewed in section ii .    in section iii",
    ", we further generalize the zgn@xmath9 equations by considering the effects of deviations from local equilibrium within the non - condensate . at the finite temperatures of interest , this deviation from local equilibrium gives rise to damping associated with the thermal conductivity and the shear viscosity .",
    "this generalization has already been discussed in section v of ref .",
    "@xcite starting from the zgn hydrodynamic equations .    in the limit that the two components are in complete local equilibrium with each other",
    ", our two - fluid hydrodynamic equations reduce to those first derived by landau in 1941  @xcite .",
    "the landau two - fluid equations give an excellent description of the low frequency response of superfluid @xmath11he  @xcite .",
    "as noted by several authors , the landau theory is also valid for bose - condensed gases .",
    "the thermal conductivity and shear viscosity were first derived for a uniform bose - condensed gas at finite temperatures in a pioneering paper by kirkpatrick and dorfman  @xcite .",
    "their results were used by gay and griffin  @xcite to evaluate the temperature - dependent damping of first and second sound as predicted by the landau two - fluid hydrodynamic equations .",
    "our present results are consistent with both of these early papers in the appropriate landau limit , namely when @xmath12@xcite .",
    "however it is important to point out that our generalized two - fluid hydrodynamic equations provide a more complete description than the original landau version since they can be used in situations in which the superfluid and normal fluid are _ not _ in local diffusive equilibrium with each other .    to illustrate the physics",
    ", we use our zgn@xmath9 equations in section iv to study the hydrodynamic normal mode spectrum of a uniform bose gas in the presence of hydrodynamic dissipation .",
    "in particular , we show how first and second sound modes are affected by viscosity and thermal conduction , and also discuss how the new relaxational mode exhibited in refs .",

    "the approximate analytic expression in ( 45 ) is useful in that it shows clearly that below @xmath107 , the relaxational mode is strongly coupled to thermal diffusion which arises from the deviation from local equilibrium of the non - condensate distribution function .",
    "indeed , one may view this damped mode as a renormalized version of the well - known thermal diffusion mode found above @xmath107  @xcite . in the classical high - temperature limit",

    "this is the well - known classical gas result for the thermal diffusion mode  @xcite .    in the zgn limit ( @xmath184 ) , ( 45 )",
    "shows that the damping rate of the relaxational mode is mainly due to the finite thermal conductivity ( if we set @xmath185 , we obtain the zero frequency mode discussed in section v of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the opposite landau limit of the zgn@xmath9 equations ( @xmath186 ) ,",
    "the width of this mode is dominated by @xmath176 , associated with the @xmath41 collisions which bring about diffusive equilibrium between the condensate and non - condensate components ( see fig .",
    "( 45 ) is in complete agreement with the qualitative picture sketched at the end of section v of ref .",
    "the mode spectrum which the coupled zgn@xmath9 equations in ( 44 ) imply below @xmath107 is different from the usual landau two - fluid hydrodynamics  @xcite . in the latter theory ,",
    "the thermal diffusion mode above @xmath107 does not persist as a relaxational mode below @xmath107 .",
    "rather , the thermal diffusion mode is interpreted as being replaced by two damped second sound modes ( @xmath187 ) below @xmath107 .",
    "4 also shows that the width of the relaxational mode increases sharply ( over and above the spurious jump at @xmath107 noted above ) as the temperature passes from above to below @xmath107 , as a result of the onset of @xmath41 collisions .",
    "this increased width of a mode peaked at @xmath188 will be a useful experimental signature of the new physics implied by the extended zgn@xmath9 hydrodynamic equations derived in the present paper .",
    "of course , all of the above analysis says nothing about the relative weight of the first sound , second sound and relaxational modes below @xmath107 .",
    "this requires the evaluation of a specific response function , such as the dynamic structure factor @xcite .",
    "further calculations along these lines are in progress .",
    "in this paper , we have extended our recent derivation @xcite of two - fluid hydrodynamic equations ( referred to as the zgn@xmath9 equations ) to include the effects of a small deviation from local equilibrium of the non - condensate atoms .",
    "this brings in the usual kind of hydrodynamic damping due to the thermal conductivity and shear viscosity of the thermal cloud . in calculating these transport coefficients",
    "we have only taken into account the deviations from local equilibrium due to the @xmath48 collision integral but have neglected the contribution coming from the @xmath41 collision integral .",
    "this limits the validity of the present calculations to the vicinity of the transition temperature .",
    "the damping due to hydrodynamic dissipation is in addition to that due to the equilibration of the condensate and non - condensate components already contained in the original zgn@xmath9 equations , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for illustration",
    ", we presented some numerical results for a _ uniform _ bose gas . in this case , we find damped first and second sound modes ( @xmath189 ) and a purely relaxational mode @xmath190 .",
    "the latter mode is not exhibited by the usual two - fluid hydrodynamic equations which assume that the condensate and non - condensate are in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the overall effect of @xmath105 and @xmath106 on the zgn@xmath9 predictions in ref .",
    "@xcite is to introduce additional damping of all three modes . above @xmath107 ,",
    "the relaxational and second sound modes @xmath191 merge into a single thermal diffusive mode .",
    "the relaxational mode below @xmath107 may therefore be viewed as the superfluid analogue of the normal thermal diffusion mode .    in another paper  @xcite",
    ", we shall use these zgn@xmath9 equations with transport coefficients to discuss the damping of hydrodynamic modes in a _ trapped _",
    "in general this is a more complex situation , since one must contend with the fact that the local equilibrium solution becomes invalid as a starting point in the low density tail of the thermal cloud  @xcite .",
    "however , one can derive general expressions for the damping and renormalization of the hydrodynamic modes as given by the zgn equations .",
    "in particular , we shall show that the damping of the out - of - phase dipole oscillation of the condensate and non - condensate components in a trapped bose - condensed gas is only weakly affected by the non - condensate transport coefficients . as a result , the damping of this mode is entirely due to the collisions between the condensate and non - condensate atoms which are responsible for bringing these two components into diffusive equilibrium .",
