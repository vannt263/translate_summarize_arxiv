    "in a recent paper [ @xcite , hereafter paper i ] , we proposed a novel mechanism for producing misalignment between the spin axis of a protostar and the normal vector of its circumstellar disc .",
    "our work was motivated by recent measurements of the sky - projected stellar obliquity using the rossiter - mclaughlin effect in transiting exoplanetary systems , which showed that a large fraction of the systems containing hot jupiters have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the planetary angular momentum axis [ see @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "additional evidence for nonzero stellar obliquity came from the statistical analysis of the apparent rotational velocities ( @xmath0 ) of planet - bearing stars @xcite .    the basic mechanism ( `` magnetically driven misalignment '' ) for producing spin  disc misalignment in accreting protostellar systems can be sumarized as follows ( paper i ) .",
    "the magnetic field of a protostar ( with @xmath1  g ) penetrates the inner region of its accretion disc .",
    "these field lines link the star and the disc in a quasi - cyclic fashion ( e.g. , magnetic field inflation followed by reconnection ; see  @xcite and  @xcite for observational evidence ) .",
    "differential rotation between the star and the disc not only leads to the usual magnetic braking torque on the disc , but also a warping torque which tends to push the normal axis of the inner disc away from the spin axis .",
    "hydrodynamical stresses in the disc , on the other hand , tend to inhibit significant disc warping .",
    "the result is that , for a given disc orientation imposed at large radii ( e.g. , by the angular momentum of the accreting gas falling onto the disc ) , the back - reaction of the warping torque can push the stellar spin axis toward misalignment with respect to the disc normal vector .",
    "planets formed in the disc will then have a misaligned orbital normal axis relative to the stellar spin axis , assuming that no evolution mechanism occurring after the dissipation of the disc forces the alignment of the system .",
    "the process of planetary system formation can be roughly divided into two stages @xcite . in the first stage , which lasts a few million years until the dissipation of the gaseous protoplanetary disc , planets are formed and undergo migration due to tidal interactions with the gaseous disc [ @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ] .",
    "the second stage , which lasts from when the disc has dissipated to the present , involves dynamical gravitational interactions between multiple planets , if they are produced in the first stage in a sufficiently close - packed configuration @xcite , and/or secular interactions with a distant planet or stellar companion @xcite .",
    "the eccentricity distribution of exoplanetary systems and the recent observational results on the spin  orbit misalignment suggest that the physical processes in the second stage play an important role in determining the properties of exoplanetary systems .",
    "nevertheless , the importance of the first stage can not be neglected as it sets the initial condition for the possible evolution in the second stage .",
    "our result in paper i shows that at the end of the first stage , the symmetry axis of the planetary orbit may be inclined with respect to the stellar spin axis .    at first sight",
    ", it may seem strange that the magnetic field effects can drive the stellar spin axis toward misalignment with respect to the disc symmetry axis , given that the spin angular momentum of the star ultimately comes from the disc and the disc contains a large reservoir of angular momentum .",
    "the key to understand this is to realize that when the gas reaches the magnetosphere boundary , its angular momentum is much smaller than in the outer disc ( the specific angular momentum of the disc is @xmath2 for a keplerian disc ) , and any magnetic torque , which in general can break the axisymmetry of the system , is of the same order of magnitude as the accretion torque on the star .",
    "a key assumption adopted in paper i for the calculation of the magnetic torque on the star from the disc is that the disc is flat .",
    "this is a nontrivial assumption .",
    "indeed , the magnetic coupling between the star and the disc operates only in the innermost disc region ( e.g. , between the inner radius @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , and this region has a much smaller moment of inertia than the star .",
    "therefore , if there were no coupling between this inner disc region and the outer disc , the inner disc would be significantly warped on a timescale much shorter than the timescale for changing the stellar spin @xcite .",
    "if there is any secular change in the stellar spin direction , the inner disc warp would then follow the varying spin axis . clearly , in order to determine the long - term spin evolution of the star , it is important to understand the dynamics of the warped disc , taking into account the magnetic torques on the inner disc and the hydrodynamical coupling between different disc regions .",
    "this is the goal of our paper .    to be more specific",
    ", there is a hierarchy of timescales related to the combined evolution of the stellar spin and the disc warp :    \\(i ) the dynamical time @xmath5 associated with the spin frequency @xmath6 , disc rotation frequency @xmath7 and the beat frequency @xmath8 .",
    "this is much shorter than the effects ( steady - state disc warping and spin evolution ) we study in this paper .",

    "we will study the evolution of the disc warp on timescales ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath13 , and the evolution of the stellar spin direction on timescales of order @xmath24 .",
    "it is important to note that we are not interested in disc warpings that vary on the dynamical timescale @xmath5 in this paper . in general , when the stellar dipole axis is inclined with respect to the spin axis , there will be periodic vertical forces at the rotation frequency of the star acting on the inner disc .",
    "these periodic forces will lead to the warping of the disc , particularly for low - viscosity discs in which bending waves propagate @xcite . indeed , there is observational evidence for such magnetically - warped discs . for example",
    ", the recurrent luminosity dips observed in the classical t tauri star aa tauri has been attributed to the periodic occultation of the central star by a warped inner disc @xcite . however , such dynamical disc warps average exactly to zero over a rotation period and have no effect on the secular evolution of the system .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : analytic ] , we summarize our analytical model of magnetopshere  disc interaction and derive the equation for the evolution of the stellar spin axis when the disc is warped . in section 3",
    "we present theoretical formalisms for determining the steady - state and time evolution of warped discs , for both high - viscosity regime ( where warps propagate diffusively ) and low - viscosity regime ( where warps propagate as bending waves ) .",
    "an approximate analytical expression for the steady - state linear warp is also derived ( see section 3.2.2 ) . in section 4",
    "we present numerical results for the steady - state disc warp profiles under various conditions and in section 5 we study the time evolution of disc warps .",
    "we examine in section 6 how the inner disc warp and the stellar spin evolution respond to variations of the outer disc , and discuss in section 7 how this could , in principle , lead to anti - aligned planetary orbits , even for discs with initial angular momentum nearly aligned with the stellar spin .",
    "we conclude in section 8 with a discussion of our results .",
    "the interaction between a magnetic star and a disc is complex ( see references in paper i ) .",
    "however , the key physical effects of this interaction on the disc can be described robustly in a parametrized manner .",
    "the model used throughout this paper is detailed in paper i. here , we will limit ourselves to a brief summary of the magnetic torques acting on the disc .",
    "the stellar magnetic field disrupts the accretion disc at the magnetospheric boundary , where the magnetic and plasma stresses balance . for a dipolar magnetic field with magnetic moment @xmath19",
    ", we have = ( ^4gm_m^2)^1/7 , [ alfven]where @xmath25 is a dimensionless constant somewhat less than unity ( @xmath26 according to recent numerical simulations ; see long et al .",
    "2005   and @xmath27 corresponds to the solution for spherical accretion ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath3 to be the inner edge of the disc . before being disrupted",
    ", the disc generally experiences nontrivial magnetic torques from the star ( lai 1999 ; paper i ) .",
    "consider a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath28 , with the vertical axis oz orthogonal to the plane of the disc .",
    "the magnetic torques are of two types : ( i ) a warping torque @xmath29 which acts in a small interaction region @xmath30 , where some of the stellar field lines are linked to the disc in a quasi - cyclic fashion ( involving field inflation and reconnection ) .",
    "these field lines are twisted by the differential rotation between the star and the disc , generating a toroidal field @xmath31 from the quasi - static vertical field @xmath32 threading the disc , where @xmath33  @xcite and the upper / lower sign refers to the value above / below the disc plane . since the toroidal field from the stellar dipole @xmath34 is the same on both sides of the disc plane , the net toroidal field @xmath35 differs above and below the disc plane , giving rise to a vertical force on the disc .",
    "while the mean force ( averaging over the azimuthal direction ) is zero , the uneven distribution of the force induces a net warping torque which tends to push the orientation of the disc angular momentum @xmath36 away from the stellar spin axis @xmath37 ( see paper i for a simple model for this effect , involving a metal plane in an external magnetic field ) .",
    "( ii ) a precessional torque @xmath38 which arises from the screening of the azimuthal electric current induced in the highly conducting disc .",
    "this results in a difference in the radial component of the net magnetic field above and below the disc plane and therefore in a vertical force on the disc .",
    "the resulting torque tends to cause @xmath36 to precess around @xmath39 . in paper",
    "i , we parametrized the two magnetic torques ( per unit area ) on the disc as _ w & = & -(r^2 ) _ w ( _ s),[eq : torquew ] + * n*_p&=&(r^2 ) _ p _ s , [ eq : torque]where @xmath40 is the surface density , @xmath41 the rotation rate of the disc , and @xmath42 is the disc tilt angle ( the angle between @xmath43 and the spin axis @xmath39 ) .",
    "the warping rate and precession angular frequency at radius @xmath44 are given by & & _ w ( r)=^2 _ , [ eqn : gamma_w ] + & & _ p ( r)=f ( _ ) , [ eqn : omega_p ] where @xmath10 is the angle between the magnetic dipole axis and the spin axis , and the dimensionless function @xmath45 is given by @xmath46 if the stellar vertical field is entirely screened out by the disc , the parameter @xmath47 ; if only the time - varying component of that field is screened out , we get @xmath48 . in reality",
    ", @xmath49 lies between 0 and 1 .",
    "the magnetic torque formulae given above contain uncertain parameters ( e.g. , @xmath12 , which parametrizes the amount of azimuthal twist of the magnetic field threading the disc ) ; this is inevitable given the complicated nature of magnetic field  disc interactions .",
    "also , while the expression for the warping torque [ eq .  ( [ eq : torquew ] ) ] is formally valid for large disc warps , the expression for the precessional torque was derived under the assumption that the disc is locally flat [ eq .  ( [ eqn : omega_p ] ) is strictly valid only for a completely flat disc @xcite ] ; when this assumption breaks down ( i.e. , when @xmath50 is large ) , we expect a similar torque expression to hold , but with modified numerical factors ( e.g. the function @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : omega_p ] ) will be different ) . in the application discussed in the following sections , we find that the condition @xmath51 is always satisfied .",
    "thus we believe that our simple formulae capture the qualitative behavior of accretion discs subject to magnetic torques .",
    "it is also worth noting that the expressions  ( [ eq : torquew]-[eq : torque ] ) for the torques only correspond to the zero - frequency component of the magnetic forces acting on the disc .",
    "the time varying components of these forces can also have significant effects .",
    "in particular , @xcite discussed how the components of the magnetic forces varying at the stellar spin frequency and at twice that frequency can excite bending waves in discs , while @xcite showed that if the star has a dipole field misaligned with its rotation axis , magnetic effects create a steady - state warp in a frame corotating with the star .",
    "however , these `` dynamical waves '' average to zero over the stellar rotation period and do not affect the secular evolution of the stellar spin . in this paper",
    ", we concern ourselves only with long - term effects , effectively studying a disc profile averaged over multiple stellar rotations .      the effects of the magnetic torques on the evolution of the star  disc system are twofold .",
    "first , they will cause the orientation of the disc @xmath43 to deviate from a flat disc profile @xmath52 , set at the outer disc radius @xmath53 .",
    "these deviations will be studied in details for different disc parameters in sections 3 - 5 .",
    "second , the back - reaction of the torques will change the orientation of the stellar spin axis on a longer timescale .",
    "the secular evolution of the stellar spin under the combined effects of matter accretion and star  disc interactions is explored in paper i in the case of flat discs .",
    "here we generalize the basic formulae derived in paper i to warped discs .",
    "in general , the spin angular momentum of the star , @xmath54 , evolves according to the equation ( j_s_s)== _ l+_s+_w+_p .",
    "[ spin]here @xmath55 represents the torque component that is aligned with the inner disc axis @xmath56 .",

    "all these effects are parametrized by the parameter @xmath60 .",

    "disc systems can thus be divided in two classes with very different long - term spin evolution ( see fig .",

    "from these results , we can see that , according to the flat - disc approximation , if @xmath61 a misaligned configuration is strongly favored .",

    ", we will show that for most ( but not all ) realistic choices of the free parameters in our model , using equation  ( [ eq : flatspinevol ] ) instead of equation  ( [ eq : warpedspinevol ] ) does not significantly change our qualitative description of the long term behavior of the system .",
    "we will measure deviations from the flat - disc approximation through the parameter @xmath93 defined by [ eq : paramangevol ] = ( ) _ flat , where the left - hand side is computed using the first line of equation  ( [ eq : warpedspinevol ] ) .",

    "we describe our method to calculate the evolution and steady - state of warped discs .",
    "systematic theoretical study on warped discs began with the work of @xcite and @xcite , who showed that there are two dynamical regimes for warp propagation in linear theory ( for sufficiently small warps ) .",

    "the viscosity , on the other hand , affects the disc warp amplitude as predicted by equations  ( [ eq : deltal ] ) and  ( [ eq : approxwarp ] ) : the warp is proportional to @xmath212 , with the amplitude @xmath333 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : approxwarp ] ) to within a factor of two .",
    "in the previous section , we have studied the time evolution of warped discs under the assumption that the orientation of the outer disc is fixed . however , a protoplanetary disc is formed inside the star forming core of a turbulent molecular cloud [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "thus in general we expect the outer orientation of protoplanetary discs to have some variations in time . in this section ,",
    "we study how the warped disc and particularly the inner disc orientation respond when the outer disc orientation varies by some finite amplitude ( chosen to be @xmath334 ) over a period of time short compared to the evolution timescale of the disc , and how such variations affect the secular evolution of the stellar spin direction .       for @xmath186 and @xmath309 , when the outer disc orientation is changed from @xmath335 at @xmath336 to @xmath337 at @xmath338 , with @xmath339 .",

    "the outer disc orientation varies by @xmath334 over @xmath343.,width=302 ]    the same type of evolution can also be studied for low - viscosity discs .",

    "we see that a bending wave created at the outer boundary propagates inward , until it reaches the inner edge of the disc where it is reflected .",
    "the total time required for the disc to reach a new steady - state is thus twice the crossing time of the bending wave , @xmath346 . for low - viscosity discs ,",
    "the condition for the steady - state approximation to be valid when the orientation of the outer disc is allowed to change over time is thus t_spin 4000 yrs . as @xmath347",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tspin ] ) ] , this condition is easily satisfied . also note that the evolution equations of bending waves adopted in our analysis are based on the flat - disc approximation .",

    "our calculations in sections 3 - 5 show that for the most likely physical parameters that characterize a magnetic star  disc system , the disc warp is small .",
    "therefore the long - term evolution of the stellar spin is generally well - described by equation  ( [ eq : flatspinevol ] ) , as long as the orientation of the outer disc is kept constant . according to  ( [ eq : flatspinevol ] ) , three types of spin evolution trend are possible , depending on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions ( paper i ) . if @xmath349 , the stellar spin and the disc axis will always align ( given enough time ) regardless of their initial relative inclination .",
    "if @xmath350 , misalignment between the disc and the stellar spin will develop , evolving towards one of the two possible final states : either @xmath351 , or a perfectly anti - aligned configuration .",
    "the second configuration can only be reached if the initial disc has a retrograde rotation with respect to the stellar spin , with @xmath352 . in this case , to explain the observed expolanetary systems with retrograde orbits relative to the stellar spin @xcite , we have to require that the disc rotates in a very different direction from the stellar rotation axis during the time of planet formation .",
    "as discussed in paper i [ called scenario ( 2 ) in section 5 of paper i ] , this is certainly possible if we consider the complex nature of star formation in molecular clouds and in star clusters [ see also  @xcite ]",
    ".    in paper i , we describe another potential pathway to create retrograde exoplanetary systems [ called scenario ( 1 ) ] starting from prograde - rotating discs .",
    "if the disc axis and stellar spin axis are initially nearly ( but not perfectly ) aligned , and the magnetic torques are such that the aligned configuration is unstable , then the misalignment angle will tend towards @xmath79 , and no retrograde planets can be produced . however , this is only true if the orientation of the outer disc does not vary .",
    "if instead we assume that the outer disc experiences a change of its orientation @xmath353 over a timescale @xmath354 sufficiently long that this change can propagate to the inner disc , but short enough that the stellar spin direction does not significantly evolve over @xmath354 , then the star ",
    "disc inclination can jump to @xmath355 , and continue to evolve towards anti - alignment .",
    "these conditions can be summarized as : & > & _ - - _ + = 180 ^ -2 ^ -1 , + t_disc & & t t_spin , where the disc warp evolution time @xmath356 if @xmath357 ( high - viscosity disc ) and @xmath358 for @xmath359 ( low - viscosity disc ) . as we have seen in sections 6.1 - 6.2 , the second and third conditions are fairly easy to satisfy , as @xmath13 is at most of order @xmath360 for a viscous disc with @xmath361 ( and @xmath13 would be significantly shorter for a smaller outer disc radius ) , while @xmath362 for typical parameters [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tspin ] ) ] .",
    "the potential to satisfy the first condition , on the other hand , will depend on the fraction of the disc angular momentum which is accreted by the star ( the parameter @xmath86 in equation  [ eq : nl ] ) and the magnetic warp efficiency ( the parameter @xmath363 ) . if the star only accretes a small fraction of the angular momentum ( @xmath364 ) , then the angles @xmath365 are both close to @xmath366 , and small variations of the outer disc are sufficient to allow the system to jump to the retrograde state and eventually evolve towards the anti - aligned configuration .",
    "the main finding of our paper is that although magnetic interactions between a protostar and its disc have a strong tendency to induce warping in the inner disc region , internal stresses in the disc tend to suppress the warping under most circumstances .",
    "the result is that in steady - state , the whole protoplanetary disc approximately lies in a single plane , which is determined by the disc angular momentum at large radii ( averaging out the dynamical warps which vary on timescales of order the stellar rotation period  such dynamical warps do not affect the secular evolution of the stellar spin ) .",
    "the reason for the small steady - state disc warp is that the effective viscosity acting to suppress disc warp , @xmath367 , is much larger than the viscosity ( @xmath368 ) responsible for angular momentum transfer within the disc @xcite .",
    "in fact , our anaylsis of the steady - state magnetically driven disc warp shows that , in the linear regime , the disc inclination angle ( relative to the stellar spin axis ) varies from the outer disc to inner disc by the amount [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cosbeta ] ) and ( [ eq : approxwarp ] ) ] |_in-_out|~ ( t_vis_w2)_in ~^2(2_in)^7/2 . where @xmath369 is the viscous time and @xmath370 is the warping rate due to the magnetic torque .",
    "this result is valid regardless of whether the warp perturbations propagate diffusively ( for @xmath105 , high - viscosity discs ) or as bending waves ( for @xmath103 , low - viscosity discs ) .",
    "thus , for the preferred values of the parameters @xmath371 , @xmath33 , we find @xmath180 for @xmath372 .",
    "moreover , our analysis of the time evolution of warped discs shows that , starting from a generic initial condition , the steady - state can be reached quickly , on a timescale shorter than the characteristic timescale for the evolution of the stellar spin orientation .",
    "overall , our study of magnetically driven warped discs presented in this paper justifies the approximate analysis ( based on the flat - disc approximation ) of the long - term evolution of spin - disc misalignment presented in paper i. nevertheless , we note that even relatively small disc warps can modify the `` equilibrium '' spin",
    " disc inclination angles @xmath243 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) from the flat - disc values , thereby affecting the `` attractors '' of the long - term evolution of the spin  disc inclination angle .",
    "if we allow for more extreme parameters ( but still reasonable by physical considerations ) for the disc  star systems , much larger disc warps become possible and qualitatively different evolutionary trends for @xmath298 may be produced ( see figs .",

    "dynamical processes ( e.g. , planet - planet scatterings and kozai interactions ) in the second stage , if they exist , would further change the spin  orbit misalignment angle . more work is needed to determine the relative importance of the two stages in shaping the properties of planetary systems .",
    "currently , the orbital eccentricity distribution of exoplanetary systems suggests that the second stage is important ( e.g. , juric & tremaine 2008 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as noted in paper i , the @xmath373 misalignment between the ecliptic plane of the solar system and the sun s equatorial plane may be explained by the magnetically driven misalignment effect studied in this paper . also , the recent discovery of kepler-9 ( holman et al .",
