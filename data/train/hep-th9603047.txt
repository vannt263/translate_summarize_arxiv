    "0.5truecm    instantons are expected to play a central role in the semiclassical anaysis of non - perturbative phenomena in non - linear field theories .",
    "both the electroweak and the strong interactions are described by the dynamics of the yang - mills(ym ) model and hence the @xmath3 instantons@xcite of the relevant ym models on @xmath1 in each case are expected to be employed . unfortunately , this programme turned out to be less successful than it was hoped .",
    "one of the main obstacles encountered was the infrared problem arising from large instanton effects in the tunneling between topologically distinct vacuua .",
    "this problem arises directly as a consequence of the scale invariance of the ym model on @xmath1 , which results in the dependence of the instanton solution on an _ arbitrary _ scale parameter .",
    "the introduction of an _ absolute _ scale would overcome this problem , and this is the original motivation of the present work .",
    "the most natural way of introducing an _ absolute _ scale is by the introduction of higgs fields , so that the dimensional parameter representing the non - zero vacuum expectation value in the higgs self- interaction potential can set the _ absolute _ scale of the would be theory .",
    "a related but additional feature of the presence of a higgs field is the _ exponential localisation _ of the instanton solution , which results in the possibility of constructing a multi - instanton field configuaration in which the individual instantons overlap only asymptotically .",
    "this is what would enable the construction of a _ dilute gas _ of instantons .",
    "furthermore with the appropriate asymptotic behaviour of these instantons , it may become possible to construct a dilute gas of instantons which interact non- trivially to yield a coulomb gas in the appropriate dimensions . by a coulomb gas",
    "we understand a gas where the contribution to the _ action _ coming from the interactions is given by the inverse of the laplacian in terms of the mutual distances of the constituents of the gas .",
    "it is our aim in the present work to propose a gauged higgs model on @xmath1 which acheives the objectives just stated .",
    "the construction of such a coulomb gas for a higgs model on @xmath4 was performed long ago by polyakov@xcite .",
    "the higgs model there@xcite consisted of the @xmath3 ym field interacting with an @xmath5 valued higgs field and the usual symmetry breaking higgs potential .",
    "firstly , the well known monopole@xcite solution of this model was taken to be the _ exponentially _ localised instantons in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "secondly , a coulomb gas of these instantons was constructed using the asymptotic fields of the monopole@xcite .",
    "our plan in the present work is to propose a gauged higgs model which supports instanton solutions with the requisite asymptotic properties capable of describing a coulomb gas on @xmath1 .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to this first task here , and defer the second technically complicated task of constructing the resulting dilute gas action to a future work . before proceding we",
    "make a remark aimed at putting the task at hand in perspective : polyakov s construction@xcite of the coulomb gas of instantons on @xmath4 is the @xmath7 dimensional analogue of the @xmath8 dimensional coulomb gas of instantons contructed previously by berezinsky and by kosterlitz and thouless@xcite employing the @xmath9 model on @xmath10 , while the present work proposes the corresponding instanton field configuration on @xmath1 .",
    "our sole task in this paper is to find the instanton solution of a particular higgs model satisfying the above stated criteria .",
    "we shall not attempt to compute the action of the corresponding coulomb gas .",
    "our plan is based on the @xmath7 dimensional example@xcite , namely to construct an appropriate gauged higgs model in contrast with the non - gauged model employed in the @xmath8 dimensional example@xcite .",
    "section * 2 * will be concerned with the instanton solution of the basic @xmath11 higgs model proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we will make a detailed numerical study of this solution and find out that inspite of the instanton in question being exponentially localised , the asymptotic properties do not permit the construction of a dilute gas whose inter - instanton interactions support a coulomb gas . then in section",
    "* 3 * we shall propose two extended versions of the basic model and will verify the existence of unit topological charge instantons by numerical techniques .",
    "these extended models are designed specially to support a non - trivial dilute coulomb gas on @xmath1 . finally in section",
    "* 4 * we will summarise our results and give a brief discussion of the outlook for the extended models .",
    "first we briefly describe the @xmath0 model introduced in ref.@xcite and then procede to subsections * 2.1 * , * 2.2 * and * 2.3 * where we give the asymptotic solutions , the numerical solutions and , an analysis of the inter - instanton interactions , respectively .",

    "is , that at high momenta or small distances when the magnitude of the higgs field is negligible with respect to the dimensional constant @xmath40 , the system is dominated by the term with the highest power of @xmath40 .",

    "thus the model ( [ 1 ] ) can be regarded as the corresponding effective action density .",
    "there are two other physically relevant properties of the system ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the first is that the gauge group @xmath31 leads to a chirally symmetric dynamics , hence does not fit in with electroweak theory .",
    "the other is that at low momentum or large distances , the gauge field dynamics is dominated by the 4-form curvature @xmath43 whose propagation properties again do not fit in with electroweak dynamics .",
    "we must therefore conclude that the model ( [ 1 ] ) is not suited to be a prototype for an electroweak theory , but it is consistent with the features strong interaction dynamics both at high and low momenta . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath18 connection @xmath17 in the gauge field multiplet @xmath44 is irrelevant and can consistently be suppressed .",
    "we have left @xmath17 in the definition of @xmath45 in ( [ 1 ] ) , because that is the most general@xcite model descending from the @xmath46 dimensional member of the yang - mills hierarchy that can support instantons , and also because when we restrict to the spherically symmetric configuration below the imposition of this symmetry will eliminate this @xmath18 field .    in view of the above reasoning",
    ", we will study the properties of this model in the context of strong interaction dynamics at low momentum , and in particular will attempt to construct a dilute gas of instantons that satifies the properties of a coulomb gas in @xmath1 , analogously to polyakov s work@xcite in @xmath4 . as the title states however , this programme will not be completed but we will restrict henceforth to the study of the classical instanton solutions of this model and its extensions .    when the values of @xmath47 respect the following restrictions : @xmath48 for each @xmath49 , then the action density ( [ 1 ] ) is bounded from below by the topological charge density @xmath50 , expressed as the divergence of the chern - simons form @xmath51 given by@xcite @xmath52 @xmath53 } \\phi \\ }   -   \\frac{1}{6 } \\phi ( \\ { ( \\eta^2 + \\phi^2),\\hat f_{\\rho \\sigma } \\ } + \\hat   d_{[\\rho } \\phi \\ : \\",

    "this restriction is quite adequate since instanton configurations of all chrges can be attained by considering the collection of arbitrarily many @xmath55 intantons , since as we shall see below these overlap only asymptotically .",
    "the reason is the presence of the higgs field which introduces the absolute scale with respect to which the instantons will be localised .",

    "if the extension consists of a positive definite quantity , then it would be expected that the topological lower bound given by the surface integral of ( [ 2 ] ) remains valid and hence that the new instanton will be classically stable .    to orient ourselves we reconsider the situation in the _ basic _ model .",
    "there the curvature decays with an inverse square power like the monopole@xcite on @xmath4 and like the latter the asymptotic connection behaves as @xmath196 with @xmath197 , and@xmath198 . after passing to the dirac - string gauge the only term in ( [ 1 ] ) which contributes , namely @xmath199 , decays with",
    "the _ eighth _ power of @xmath66 and hence the @xmath165-dimensional integral of it decays with the _ fourth _ power of @xmath66 .",
    "it is clear why this decay is too strong to result in a coulmb potential since the latter is characterised by its _",
    "inverse square _ behaviour in @xmath165-dimensions .",
    "this leads us unambiguously to the criterion that the extension to our _ basic _ model must include a term decaying with the _ sixth _ power of @xmath66 , and since we expect the asymptotic properties of the _ extended _ model to be the same as those of the _ basic _ model ( [ 12 ] ) , i.e. _ inverse square _ decaying curvature , the extension must include the _ third _ power of the curvature .",
    "inevitably this means that a new dimensional constant different from the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath40 must be introduced .",
    "we shall refer to this as criterion ( a ) below .",
    "the other criterion , ( b ) , which we shall require is that the density in question involve no higher powers of the velocity fields than the _ second_. in other words , for fixed @xmath200 and @xmath201 , no higher powers of @xmath202 should occur in the new density .",
    "this criterion is respected by all skyrme - like models , including the skyrme model@xcite as well as the hierarchy of yang - mills models@xcite and their descendents@xcite . in the context of some more phenomenologically motivated considerations",
    ", this criterion could be relaxed , but this is not the case in the present work .",
    "the reason for requiring this criterion is that in its absence the definition of the canonical momentum - fields would lead to problems in , say the collective coordinate quantisation and more specifically in the analysis of the fluctuation spectrum when this is eventually performed .",
    "while this analysis is beyond the scope of the present work , we envisage that it should in principle be accessible and hence insist here on this criterion ( b ) .",
    "having stated our main criteria ( a ) and ( b ) for the extension , we introduce the other criteria .",
    "obviously this density must be both lorentz invariant , and gauge invariant .",
    "in addition it would be an advantage from the viewpoint of esablishing the existence of the instanton of the extended model , if this density was positive definite by construction . as we shall see below",
    ", it will not be possible to satisfy this last criterion .",
    "subject to the constraints of lorentz and gauge invariances , criterion(a ) narrows the choices for candidates down to the following three densities : @xmath203 the last of these is equivalent to the non - local effective action density for low momentum gluons@xcite@xcite @xmath204 ,",
    "while the other possible term @xmath205 with the required dimensions is related to the two of the above listed terms through @xmath206 invoking the criterion ( b ) eliminates all but the first of these three candidates , namely the extension to our basic model ( [ 1 ] ) must be uniquely    @xmath207    where @xmath208 is the new constant with the same dimensions as @xmath40 .",
    "this particular dynamical model ( [ 34 ] ) defined on @xmath209 , has appeared previously in the literature@xcite@xcite in a different context where self- dual solutions are found@xcite@xcite and their stability is examined@xcite . in particular , the fact that criterion ( a ) is satisfied by ( [ 34 ] ) was discussed in some detail in ref.@xcite . in the present context on @xmath1 , it was first proposed in ref.@xcite .    anticipating a result of the next subsection , namely that the extension of ( [ 1 ] ) by the density ( [ 34 ] ) will result in a _ power _",
    "decay for the gauge connection function @xmath79 which in its absence had decayed _ exponentially _ according to ( [ 16 ] ) , we introduce a second extension to be added to the first one ( [ 34 ] ) with the aim of rectifying this situation .",
    "this second extension , which will introduce yet another dimensional constant , is    @xmath210    where @xmath211 is this second constant with the dimensions of @xmath40 , and @xmath212 is an unimportant dimensionless constant which will be set equal to @xmath38 below .",
    "the density ( [ 35 ] ) is immediately recognised as the usual quadratic higgs kinetic term plus the usual symmetry breaking potential . this term , being entirely @xmath39 dependent , will have no effect on the inter - instanton interactions and is introduced merely to restore exponential decay .",
    "clearly it is not possible to add the usual ym term @xmath213 term to ( [ 35 ] ) as this will render the action logarithmically divergent and would invalidate the instanton solution .",
    "we note here that the optional criterion of positive definiteness is _ not _ satisfied by ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "this will necessitate some detailed asymptotic and numerical analysis of the extended systems carried out below , because the lack of positive definiteness of the extension means that the topological stability of the instanton of the _ basic _ model ( [ 1 ] ) does not automatically guarantee the same for the extended model .",
    "indeed , if the coupling constant @xmath208 in ( [ 34 ] ) is allowed to be large , its lack of posititvity will destroy the stability of the instanton in the extended model .",
    "thus it is imperative that this constant @xmath208 be taken to be small .",
    "what small means in this context will be determined according to quantitative criteria to be applied in subsection * 3.2 * where the numerical integrations are described , and the extent to which these criteria are met will be discussed in detail in section * 4*. here , in justification the extension ( [ 34 ] ) , we suffice to note that the value of the this density remains positive as long as the asymtotic conditions ( [ 12 ] ) are respected as we shall find to be the case in the subsection * 3.1 * immediately below .",
    "summarising , we propose two related extensions of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the first is obtained by the addition of ( [ 34 ] ) to ( [ 1 ] ) , anmely @xmath214 , and the second by the addition of ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) to ( [ 1 ] ) , namely @xmath215 .",
    "the one - dimensional subsystems @xmath216 and @xmath217 arising from the imposition of spherical symmetry on the extensions @xmath218 and @xmath219 , analogous to the one - dimensional subsystem ( [ 9 ] ) of ( [ 1 ] ) are , respectively    @xmath220    @xmath221    it is important to note that the one dimensional density @xmath216 remains positive provided that the asymptotic conditions ( [ 12 ] ) are satisfied by the solution , inspite of not being a positive definite quantity by construction .",
    "we shall find this to be the case below when we solve the euler - lagrange equations @xmath222 and @xmath223 in the region @xmath74 .",
    "this will be the justification of employing ( [ 34 ] ) as an extension .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations @xmath224 for ( [ 36 ] ) , and , @xmath225 and @xmath226 for ( [ 37 ] ) , are given respectively by    @xmath227    @xmath228    @xmath229    to start with we dispose of the question of the asymptotic solutions in the @xmath75 region , to both the extended models @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "we have verified that the additional terms do not change the behaviours ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) for the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "there then just remains to find the asymptotic behaviours in the @xmath74 region .",
    "consider first the extended system @xmath232 .",
    "the @xmath233 equations of its one - dimensional subsystem are unchanged and are given by ( [ 11 ] ) , while the @xmath234 equations are now given by ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) .",
    "linearising the latter around the asymptotic value of @xmath106 we find    @xmath235    which has a power _ decay _ solution yielding @xmath236 provided that @xmath237 .",
    "this is not physically unreasonable since the constant @xmath40 is expected to be large , while @xmath208 can be taken to be small . in practice",
    "we have set @xmath238 in all our numerical computations and , taken @xmath239 to be of the order of unity , while @xmath208 must be taken to be sustantially smaller than unity if the lack of positive definiteness of @xmath218 ( [ 34 ] ) is not to predjudice the instanton solution of the _ basic _ model .",
    "thus , for the parameters employed in our numerical computations , the conditions for ( [ 41 ] ) to imply a rapid decay are met .    notwithstanding the fact that we expect a rapid decay ( [ 41 ] ) for the function @xmath79 , it would be desirable to extend the model in such a way that like the function @xmath80 , the function @xmath79 also decays exponentially .",
    "this is because the validity of the approximations that will be made in an eventual application of the instanton solutions found here to the construction of a dilute instanton gas , rely on the strong localisation of the instantons and the best way of meeting this requirement is by exponential localisation .    to this end",
    ", we consider the extension @xmath240 . in this case , the one - dimensional euler - lagrange equations @xmath241 and @xmath242 are given by ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 38 ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "linearising these around their asymptotic values @xmath106 and @xmath243 we find @xmath244 @xmath245 where we have used the dimensionless rescalings @xmath246 and @xmath247 of the radial variable @xmath66 .",
    "note that the notations @xmath248 and @xmath143 in ( [ 42 ] ) and ( [ 43 ] ) are different from those in ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) . from the fourth power of @xmath248 in the last term of ( [ 42 ] ) it is clear that this equation can not be brought to the form of a modified bessel equation so we evaluate its asymptotic solution directly , yielding @xmath79 in the @xmath74 region to be @xmath249 which is clearly exponentially localised .",
    "equation ( [ 43 ] ) on the other hand can be brought to the form of a bessel equation with the solution @xmath250 yielding    @xmath251    in summary , we see that in the extended model @xmath252 , the function @xmath80 is exponentially localised according to ( [ 17 ] ) , while the function @xmath79 is power localised according to ( [ 41 ] ) . in the extended model @xmath253 both functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are exponentially localised according to ( [ 44 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) respectively .",
    "we see that the function @xmath80 is exponentially localised according to ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) for both the extended models @xmath252 and @xmath253 , respectively , while the fuction @xmath79 is power localised according to ( [ 41 ] ) for the model @xmath232 and exponentially localised according to ( [ 44 ] ) for @xmath240 .",
    "perhaps the most important result of this subsection is , that the asymptotic behaviours of the function @xmath79 in both extended models given respectively by ( [ 18]),([41 ] ) , and , ( [ 18]),([44 ] ) , ensure that the one dimensional density ( [ 36 ] ) does not become negative .      for the purposes of numerical integrations",
    "we have employed the following two values of the coupling constant @xmath208 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 in([34 ] ) , which result in appropriately small quantitative extensions of the _ basic _ model .    for the extended model @xmath256 given by ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 34 ] ) , we have integrated equations @xmath257 and @xmath233 given respectively by ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 38 ] ) , and by ( [ 11 ] ) , numerically , starting with the functions ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) near @xmath105 and choosing the numerical values of the constants @xmath32 and @xmath119 so that @xmath79 and @xmath80 reach their asymptotic values given by the second members of ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "we have performed this integration only for the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath258 .",
    "the numerical values of the pair of constants @xmath128 are fixed by the numerical integrations , and are listed in the first and second colums of table 2 .",
    "the profiles of the functions @xmath79 for this extended model are not given since they are qualitatively the same as those in figure 1 , while the function @xmath80 is the same as that for the _ basic _ model and is given by the @xmath131 curve in figure 2 .",
    "the numerical values of the total actions @xmath259 and @xmath259 pertaining to these two solutions are listed in the third column of table 2 .",
    "for the extended model @xmath260 given by ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) , we have employed the same two values of the coupling constant @xmath261 as above and for each of these the values of the coupling constant @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "we have integrated the two second order equations @xmath264 given by ( [ 10 ] ) ( [ 38 ] ) and ( [ 38a ] ) , and , @xmath265 given by ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "again we have performed this integration only for @xmath266 , and the values of the pair of numerical constants @xmath267 are fixed by the numerical integration and are listed in the first and second columns of table 3 .",
    "again the profiles of the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not exhibited since they are qualitatively the same as those in figures 1 . and 2 .",
    "the numerical values of the total actions pertaining to these two solutions are @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "since the density @xmath218 ( [ 34 ] ) is * not * positive definite , the stability of the instantons of both the models decsribed by the densities @xmath270 and @xmath271 are not guaranteed by the stability of the instanton of the _ basic model_. we argued above however , that if the coupling constant @xmath208 is small enough , the instantons of the extended models will nevertheless be stable . to this end , the values of the total actions corresponding to each instanton given above are relevant .",
    "quantitatively , we seek to demonstrate that the addition of the extension densities ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) to the _ basic _ density ( [ 1 ] ) does * not * result in an appreciable change in the value of the action integrals .",
    "the detailed comparisons are deferred to section * 4*.    before proceding to section * 4 * however , we must perform one further numerical operation . from the viewpoint of these quantitative comparisons , the difference of the extended model @xmath230 from the _ basic _",
    "model is just the non - positive density @xmath218 and hence the interesting quantity is the difference of their action integrals .",
    "the extended model @xmath271 however is the result of the addition of the non - positive density @xmath218 to the positive definite density @xmath272 and not to the _ basic _ density alone .",
    "the interesting quantity in this case therefore is the difference of the action integral of @xmath271 from that of the system described by @xmath273 , which we have not studied numerically hitherto .",
    "this we now do by integrating the euler - lagrange equations @xmath274 given by ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 38a ] ) , and @xmath275 given by ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "we have performed the numerical integrations for the value of @xmath276 only , and for the values of the coupling constant @xmath277 and @xmath263 .",
    "the numerical values of the constants @xmath278 for these solutions are listed in the first and secon columns of table 4 , while the values of the total action arelisted in the third column of table 4 .",
    "we do not plot the profiles of the functions @xmath79 and @xmath80 in this case because they are qualitatively the same as those in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "we have made a detailed numerical study of _ unit _ topological charge instanton solutions of the @xmath0 higgs model@xcite and its extensions@xciteon @xmath1 .",
    "the extensions to the _ basic _ model are devised such that the dynamics of the extended model would in principle be capable of supporting a dilute coulomb gas of interacting instantons .",
    "this construction however is deferred to future work , and in the present work we have restricted ourselves to establishing the existence of the classical instanton solutions using numerical methods .    in section * 2 * , we have studied the spherically symmetric instanton solution of the basic models ( [ 1 ] ) parametrised by a set of dimensionless constants @xmath279 , for four different such sets @xmath280 listed in table 1 .",
    "the results are exhibited in table 1 and figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the unusual feature of the system ( [ 1 ] ) is that for the case @xmath281 , namely for @xmath282 , where the lower bound on the action is saturated by the bogomolnyi equations ( [ 3])-([5 ] ) , the only solution is the trivial constant asymptotic values of the fields .",
    "that equations ( [ 3])-([5 ] ) are overdetermined can clearly be seen by inspection of their spherically symmetric restrictions ( [ 21])-([24 ] ) , which are four constraints on two functions .",
    "this feature is shared with the usual skyrme model@xcite , in which case however the departure of the soliton solution from the self - dual field configuration is fixed by the absolute scale there . here by contrast",
    "this departure is depends on the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath283 , and in this sense our model is more akin to the abelian higgs model@xcite on @xmath10 which even though it _ does _ support self- dual solutions , the departure from self - duality depends on the value of the dimensionless coupling strength @xmath284 multiplying the higgs potential .",
    "@xmath284 in that case is the analogue of @xmath285 here . in both models",
    "the value of the action integral increases with an increase in the value of these dimensionless coupling strength(s ) .",
    "this is seen to be the case from the third column of table 1 , where all the action integrals @xmath286 are larger than the topological lower bounds .",
    "in particular the action integral @xmath287 is larger than the lower bound @xmath38 in that case , while the actions @xmath286 for @xmath288 are each larger than their respective lower bounds @xmath289 . to demonstrate more quantitatively the departute from the self dual configuration , we have plotted the profiles of the one - dimensional restriction of the stress - tensor @xmath134 for each solution in figure 4 .    in section * 3 * we have given some arguments in favour of our choice of extended models and proceded to study these numerically .",
    "it turns out that our choice for an extension of ( [ 1 ] ) is narrowed down to the cubic density ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "this density being non positive definite , there is no guarantee that its addition to ( [ 1 ] ) will not invalidate the topological lower bound . in that case",
    "the extended model would not support an instanton solution .",
    "we have argued that for small enough coupling of this term , the instanton solution persists in the extended model is the dynamics of the basic model is robust enough .",
    "the numerical data pertaining to this extended model @xmath230 is given in table 2 .",
    "we can see that the action of @xmath230 does not differ appreciably from the action of the basic model , by comparing the actions @xmath290 in table 2 with the action @xmath291 in table 1 .",
    "indeed , this difference is smaller for the case with the smaller value of the coupling constant @xmath208 , thus justifying our claim that for small enough modifications of the basic model we can expect to have intanton solutions .",
    "the function @xmath80 parametrising the instanton of the extended model @xmath230 is localised exponentially according to ( [ 17 ] ) , but the function @xmath79 is power localised according to ( [ 41 ] ) .",
    "this has motivated us to consider yet another extension , for which both functions @xmath80 and @xmath79 are both exponentially localised .",
    "this is the model @xmath271 which results from the further addition of the density ( [ 35 ] ) to @xmath292 and whose exponentially decaying solutions are given by ( [ 44 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) .",
    "the numerical data for this model is given in table 3 .",
    "to carry out the corresponding quantitative checks as in the previous case , we need to compare the values of the actions @xmath293 with the action integral of the positive definite density defined by the sum of ( [ 1 ] ) and the positive definite density @xmath219 defined by ( [ 35 ] ) .",
    "we have denoted this system by @xmath294 and listed the numerical data pertaining to it in table 4 .",
    "we must therefore compare the actions @xmath295 in table 3 with the corresponding actions @xmath296 in table 4 .",
    "the qualitative conclusions are exactly the same as those for the extended model @xmath292 , namely that the action in the extended model @xmath271 is close enough to that of the basic model , that @xmath271 also supports instanton solutions .",
    "quantitatively , the differences @xmath297 and @xmath298 are practically equal , implying that the system ( [ 1 ] ) is equally robust against the addition of ( [ 34 ] ) as against the addition of ( [ 34 ] ) and ( [ 35 ] ) , even though in the second case the exponential decay was better satisfied .",
    "evidently , this means that the value chosen for the coupling constant @xmath208 was sufficiently small so that the extended systems arising from the addition of the non - positive definite @xmath2 term ( [ 34 ] ) result in new systems that also support instanton solutions . to test the validity of this criterion , consider the differences of the corresponding actions for the extended models with a larger value of the coupling constant @xmath208 .",
    "thus @xmath299 and @xmath300 , which are again nearly equal to each other but are very considerably larger than the former pair of differences .",
    "this completes our justification of the extended models @xmath301 and @xmath260 .",
    "having established that the _ extended _ models also can support instantons with the same asymptotic properties as the instantons of the _ basic _ model , the remaining task is to compute the volume integral      in the dirac string gauge .",
    "clearly @xmath303 in ( [ 46 ] ) is the * only * nonvanishing contribution to the action due to inter - instanton interactions since in the dirac string gauge the asymptotic contributions of all higgs dependent terms vanish and the density of the only other higgs independent term in either extended action density coming from @xmath304 also vanishes according to our arguments at the end of subsection * 3.2 * , namely ( [ 33 ] ) .",
    "the integrand in ( [ 46 ] ) , which is readily calculated by substituting ( [ 27 ] ) in ( [ 46 ] ) , is a quantity of considerable complexity and since we will not perfom the integration here we do not write it down .",
    "if one set any two of the summation indices @xmath189 , in ( [ 46 ] ) the same , namely restricted to `` two neighbour '' interactions , then the integrand would become singular at the origin in the usual way .",
    "thus the interaction term will have to take account of `` three neighbour '' interactions .",
    "this situation may be changed by replacing the cubic extension term ( [ 34 ] ) in ( [ 46 ] ) by the alternative density @xmath305 appearing in ( [ 34z ] )      which is a `` two neighbour '' interaction .",
    "the details of these contributions to the action as well as their consequences in the resulting effective theory of strong interactions will be investigated and given elsewhere .",
