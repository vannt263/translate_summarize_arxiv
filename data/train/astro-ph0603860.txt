    "nearby galaxies have proven to be important laboratories for the study of the basic properties and evolutionary histories of all galaxies .",

    "the nature of far - infrared emission in other local group dwarf galaxies has primarily been inferred from spatially unresolved iras observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , due in large part to our previous inability to perform sensitive wide - field , high - resolution imaging at these wavelengths .    of particular interest in these infrared images",
    "is the emission attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "emission from these macro - molecules has been detected in numerous massive galaxies , often highlighting the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) surrounding large  regions @xcite .",
    "this morphological coincidence is normally attributed to the hard radiation field inside the  region dissociating the molecules @xcite , while outside the pdr there are insufficient uv photons to excite pahs into emission .",
    "however , pahs have also been found in the quiescent ism , as reported by @xcite in their detection of pahs in an isolated cirrus cloud illuminated only by the typical interstellar radiation field of the solar neighborhood .",
    "what is not well understood is the dust and pah content in lower mass , lower metallicity systems .",
    "it is assumed that these systems will exhibit less pah emission due to the ability of the interstellar radiation field to penetrate through lower dust column densities ( due to potentially lower dust - to - gas ratios in low - metallicity environments ) dissociating or destroying the pahs @xcite . however , sensitivity has limited previous mid - infrared studies to massive galaxies and starburst systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these types of studies have also been performed with  @xcite , including studies of lower mass , lower luminosity objects @xcite .",
    "however , for quiescent dwarf irregular galaxies the dependence of hot dust / pah emission on galaxy properties such as metallicity or current star formation rate remains relatively unexplored .",
    "the unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution of  for the first time enables us to directly image the spatial distribution of the hot dust / pah population in these low surface brightness systems .",
    "in addition , the close proximity of these galaxies allows us to discern the diffuse dust emission from the underlying stellar population , which is still not possible in more distant systems .    in this paper",
    "we present /infrared array camera ( irac ) 4.5 and 8.0  images of 15 local group and nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "the continuum subtracted 8  images are sensitive to both the 7.7  pah feature as well as any hot ( @xmath0350 k ) dust present in these objects .",
    "our galaxy sample spans a range of over one dex in metallicity , 8.5 mag in absolute b magnitude , and three orders of magnitude in current star formation rate to which we can compare the diffuse 8  flux . in  [ observations ]",
    "we describe the observations , data reduction , and continuum subtraction procedures . in  [ individual ] we present our images and discuss interesting features of individual objects . in  [ discussion ] we investigate correlations of diffuse 8  flux with other galaxy properties and compare these results with similar studies and discuss possible causes for the drop of diffuse 8  flux at low metallicity .",
    "we summarize our findings in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "our galaxy sample was chosen from the list of all dwarf galaxies judged by mateo to be potential local group members ( as reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) ) based on heliocentric radial velocities and an estimate of the local group zero - velocity surface .",
    "we have selected all the irregular and transition ( dirr / dsph ) galaxies that are more than 20@xmath1 above or below the galactic plane and that were not already listed in the  reserved object catalog .",
    "the data were acquired with the irac camera @xcite on the  space telescope @xcite as part of a guaranteed time program ( pid # 128 , p.i .",
    "gehrz ) that consists of imaging and spectroscopy of 16 local group and nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "while irac is capable of imaging at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  ( hereafter channels 1 - 4 respectively ) , the field of view of channels 1 and 3 is offset from that of channels 2 and 4 . in this exploratory program",
    ", we chose to image our targets in only channels 2 and 4 , since these bandpasses allow us to detect both the stellar population ( channel 2 ) and the hot dust / pah ( channel 4 ) components simultaneously .",
    "for all targets in both channels , we performed five dither positions with exposure times of 200 seconds each , except for ngc  55 and wlm which had exposure times of 100 seconds per dither position .",
    "a single 5@xmath2 @xmath3 5@xmath2 pointing was used for all targets except wlm , ngc  55 , ngc  3109 , and ic  1613 .",
    "wlm , ngc 3109 , and ic  1613 were mosaicked in array coordinates using 1 @xmath3 3 , 1 @xmath3 2 , and 2 @xmath3 2 pointing grids respectively ( see table [ sample ] ) .",
    "ngc  55 was mosaicked in sky coordinates using a 1 @xmath3 3 pointing mosaic .",
    "the data were reduced using the mopex reduction package version 2004 october 15 .",
    "detector artifacts such as column pull - down and muxbleed were corrected with the ` cosmetic ' program .",
    "these corrected data were then used as the input images for the ` overlap ' routine which matches the backgrounds of individual frames to create a smooth background in the final mosaic .",
    "outlier detection , image interpolation , and image co - addition were done with the ` mosaic ' task ; this program also produced the final mosaics with a pixel scale of 0.86 , which was motivated by @xcite .",
    "some of our channel 4 data were strongly affected by persistent images resulting from bright sources imaged in the program immediately before our data were taken .",
    "subtracting a background - subtracted median - combined image from each frame proved very effective at removing these artifacts .",
    "we then created the ` continuum - subtracted ' images . while a single fiducial image frame was used to create all four irac mosaics , the image alignment was still not adequate .",
    "an additional translation for each galaxy ( typically 0.5  -  1.2 pixels in x and y ) was required to align the channel 2 and channel 4 images .",
    "the channel 2 image was aligned with the channel 4 image by calculating the centroids of point sources in both channel 2 and channel 4 images , and shifting the channel 2 image to align it with the coordinates measured in channel 4 .",
    "the channel 2 image was then convolved with a psf kernel to attempt to reproduce the channel 4 psf .",
    "extensive tests were performed , including aperture photometry on the residual ` diffuse ' image .",
    "we found no evidence for systematic differences between the modeled and observed channel 4 psf compared to the overall flux uncertainty in the images .",
    "next , we subtracted the background value from the convolved channel 2 image , which we determined by taking the mode of non - crowded regions in the image . and finally , we multiplied the channel 2 image by a scale factor ( listed in table [ data ] ) and subtracted it from the channel 4 image to study the diffuse emission at 8 .",
    "this scale factor was determined empirically by finding the value that removed the majority of the underlying point sources without leaving residual peaks or holes .",
    "this process is inherently uncertain since adopting one color for the entire stellar population is a rather poor approximation .",
    "the errors associated with this method are also exaggerated because we are typically dealing with a few tens to hundreds of resolved point sources , as opposed to the smooth stellar population in unresolved galaxies .",
    "we find in general that the best value for the scale factor was 0.4 , which is consistent with the studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this consistency is notable , since in our low - metallicity systems the ratio of m - type agb stars to carbon stars is significantly higher than in more metal - rich systems . because agb stars constitute the majority of the point sources we detect in channel 4 , this would lead us to expect , on average , redder sources than in the more metal - rich sources studies by the former authors . indeed , the average channel 2 - 4 color of point sources for the galaxy wlm is 1.07 ( jackson et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) , yet applying the scale factor that corresponds to this color ( 0.95 ) produces an extreme over - subtraction for a large fraction of the sources and a negative total diffuse 8  total flux for the galaxy ( please note , throughout this work all magnitudes are vega - relative ) .",
    "further , we find a different scale factor for ngc  55 ( 0.7 ) , which is the most metal - rich object in our sample .    for all of the galaxies in our sample",
    "we adopt a 3@xmath4 scale factor error of 50% .",
    "this value was chosen because tests showed adopting a scale factor 50% higher would result in a negative total diffuse 8  flux for the four galaxies in our sample with the lowest current star formation rate , and therefore the least expected diffuse 8  emission . the total flux uncertainty in the channel 2 and channel 4 images of all the galaxies is assumed to be 10% @xcite .",
    "the photometric uncertainty we report for the diffuse 8  fluxes were calculated using the error propagation equation , which included the total flux uncertainties from the channel 2 and channel 4 images and the uncertainty in the scale factor .",
    "we include no independent error due to foreground star contamination , since foreground stars are treated in the same manner as stars in their host galaxy in the continuum subtraction process and are therefore included in the scale factor error estimation .    the images were trimmed to remove the low signal - to - noise edges that result from the dithering pattern we chose",
    ". otherwise the entire images were used to derive the fluxes except in the case of sextans  a , which has an extremely bright foreground star in the field . the flux calculation for this object",
    "is described in  [ sextans_a ] .",
    "for all of the objects except sextans  a , we calculated the diffuse 8  flux by finding the sum of the residual flux with ` imstat ' in iraf , applying the correction for an infinite aperture , and subtracting the total background .",
    "as an example of the complexity in interpreting diffuse 8 emission in galaxies , @xcite have found spatially variable pah emission strengths in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705 ; mid - ir spectra of two regions , with the same nebular metallicity , show very different pah to continuum ratios .",
    "since we are unable to distinguish between pah emission and thermal continuum from hot dust in our broadband images , we make no color - correction in calculating the 8 fluxes . also because of the ambiguity between pah and thermal dust continuum emission",
    ", we will refer throughout this paper to the sum of these components as ` diffuse 8  emission . '",
    "future irs spectra from regions of bright 8  emission in these objects will be necessary to distinguish between pah and hot dust emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in the following sections we briefly describe the relationships between diffuse 8  emission ( for the objects we detect ) and observations at other wavelengths . images of the galaxies in which we detect prominent diffuse 8  emission are shown in figure [ n55 ] ( for ngc  55 ) and figure [ 3detect ] ( for ic  5152 , ngc  3109 , and ic  1613 ) .",
    "objects with only low surface brightness emission are shown in figure [ split1 ] ( for wlm and sextans a ) and figure [ split2 ] ( for sextans b and ddo  216 ) .",
    "the objects with no detected diffuse 8  emission ( antlia , ddo  210 , gr  8 , leo  a , lgs  3 , phoenix dwarf irregular , and ugca  438 ) are shown in figure [ nodetect ] .",
    "this low - luminosity galaxy has very weak h@xmath5 emission , as there are only one compact h  ii region and one diffuse h  ii region known @xcite .",
    "most of the diffuse 8  emission in the dwarf galaxy is concentrated about the two h  ii regions , coincident with the peak of the h  i distribution @xcite .",
    "the measured present - day star formation rate is very small ( @xmath6 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 ; @xcite ) , and is much lower than the mean star formation rate over the lifetime of the galaxy . with",
    "_ stellar photometry , @xcite showed that the star formation rate was elevated by a factor of a few about @xmath0 1  gyr ago compared to the present day star formation rate .",
    "@xcite obtained deep _ hst _ photometry of stars in an outer field of the galaxy , and demonstrated that the star - formation rate @xmath0 35 gyr ago was enhanced by roughly a factor of two compared to the present - day star - formation rate .",
    "most of the diffuse 8  emission is roughly coincident with the complex of h@xmath5 bubble- , loop- , and filamentary - structure in the northeast part of the galaxy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath5 complex contains a well - studied supernova remnant ( snr ; @xcite ) , labeled h  ii region # 49 ( @xcite ; also known as sandage 8 or s8 ) .",
    "this snr has been studied recently by @xcite and @xcite , the latter of which showed that the superbubbles have dynamical ages of @xmath0 12  myr .",
    "they also suggested that the snr is partly hidden by dust , because the snr is located near the intersection of two to three large h@xmath5 shells ( r4 , r9 , and r10 in @xcite ) , in which there appears to be material with high obscuration .",
    "in fact , the peak of the 8  emission appears to be located between the snr and an h  ii region just to the northwest ( h  ii # 39 in @xcite ) .",
    "the location is near the east - west midpoint of the obscuration ridge seen in h@xmath5 velocity maps by @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that most of the 8  emission is found near the locations of the h@xmath5 bubbles , where there may be a concentration of molecular and dusty material .",
    "we should point out that two additional very faint patches of diffuse 8  emission are coincident with the positions of the bright h  ii regions # 37 near the southeast corner of the galaxy and # 13 towards the western side of the galaxy .      despite the relative isolation , modest luminosity , and relatively low gas - phase metallicity",
    ", this dwarf contains regions of bright 8  emission which lie in the mid - plane of the galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , there is no published h@xmath5 map available for comparison . however , a bright 8  peak on the eastern side appears to correspond to h  ii region `` a , '' whose optical spectrum was measured by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the diffuse 8  peak near the center of the galaxy appears to correspond to a large grouping of bright ultraviolet point sources @xcite , which are likely o- and b - type stars ; their corresponding optical sources ( though unresolved ) were noted by @xcite .",

    "the variety of structure and intensity seen in diffuse 8  emission appears to match similarly with those in h@xmath5 .",
    "for example , the shell - like structure to the northeast in 8  at @xmath9 ( j2000 ) = @xmath10 corresponds in h@xmath5 with the u - shaped structure and h  ii region h5 in @xcite .",
    "this shell , another similar shell immediately to the south , and the central emission regions correspond to similar features seen at 24  @xcite .",
    "there is also a large faint shell in 8  ( centered roughly at @xmath11 ) just southwest of the center ( `` below '' the midplane ) of the galaxy .",
    "this feature is seen as a chain of h  ii regions and bubbles in @xcite .",

    "the `` frothy '' infrared emission to the east is related to the diffuse h@xmath5 emission @xcite .",
    "sextans  a is a dwarf irregular galaxy in the antlia - sextans group . with _",
    "_ photometry of the resolved stellar population , @xcite and @xcite showed that ( 1 ) a region with star - formation activity in the last 50  myr coincided with the brightest h  ii regions and the peak in the h  i distribution @xcite , and ( 2 ) that the pattern of star formation was occurring in a stochastic manner throughout the galaxy .",
    "the most recent star formation activity was shown to be about a factor of ten higher than the average star - formation activity over a hubble time .",
    "@xcite obtained an upper limit for the co molecular gas .",
    "the extremely bright foreground star along the line of sight to sextans  a causes significant problems in our  data , since the continuum subtraction of this object leaves broad negative wings across the image .",
    "however , we detect low level diffuse 8  emission coincident with the bright h  ii region # 17 @xcite in the southeastern corner of the galaxy . to minimize the effect of the foreground star",
    ", we only summed the diffuse 8  flux from this region .",
    "consequently , the measured flux is plotted as a lower limit in figures [ 3corr ] and [ 3groups ] , since we are not sensitive to any emission outside this region .",
    "sextans  b is a another dwarf irregular galaxy in the antlia - sextans group , and has properties closely resembling that of sextans  a. however , @xcite argue that there may be a spatial inhomogeneity in the h  ii region oxygen abundance by 0.3  dex over a length scale of about 0.6  kpc .",
    "the low surface brightness emission at 8  appears to coincide with h  ii regions # 1 , # 5 , and # 10 from @xcite .",

    "@xcite derived a total present - day star formation rate ( based on the h@xmath5 flux ) of about @xmath17 @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , and @xcite presented low upper limits to the total amount of co gas in the galaxy .",
    "_ hst _ photometry of the resolved stellar populations @xcite suggests that increased star - formation , mostly in the bar of the galaxy , has taken place recently in the last @xmath18 1  gyr .",
    "diffuse 8  emission is mostly associated with the two dominant h  ii regions hm  7 and hm  9 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that there could be excess dust or regions of higher extinction near the second h  i peak in the southeast portion of the galaxy , which may explain the small compact regions of 8  emission .",
    "however , the spectroscopic line - of - sight reddening values ( near zero ) from the latter author derived from the balmer decrement for the bright h  ii regions hm  7 and hm  9 can not explain the presence of 8  emission .",
    "iso observations revealed , for the first time , the scarcity of pah emission in low - metallicity systems @xcite . more recently",
    "though , similar studies with  have been carried out by @xcite , and @xcite , among others .",
    "the observations presented here are different in that the galaxies in our sample are well - resolved , which allows us to address the spatial distribution of the diffuse 8  emission in these galaxies .",
    "it is important to note that we are required to treat our data differently than the studies mentioned above .",
    "this is because the highly resolved nature of our images allows us to determine that a substantial fraction of the 8  emission in our images comes from the stellar population ( both foreground and in the galaxies themselves ) .",
    "consequently , we found it necessary to subtract the continuum from the images prior to summing the 8  flux .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite each address the expected stellar flux at 8.0 and conclude no continuum subtraction is necessary for their samples .    in table",
    "[ data ] we list the diffuse 8  fluxes along with other galaxy properties . of the 15 targets observed for this program",
    "only ngc  55 , ic  5152 , ic  1613 , and ngc  3109 have prominent diffuse emission at 8 , while ddo  216 , sextans  a , sextans  b , and wlm show only low surface brightness emission .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have shown that there are correlations of the diffuse 8  emission with both host galaxy metallicity and current star formation rate .",
    "we will investigate the physical processes that are responsible for these correlations later in this section .",
    "first , however , we wish to examine the null hypothesis , which is that the lack of diffuse 8  emission in galaxies with low metallicity and low star formation rate is simply an artifact of the correlations of metallicity and star formation rate with galaxy mass . that is to say ,",
    "are the systems which seem to be deficient in diffuse 8  emission simply smaller systems that we would expect to have less total ism , including pahs and dust ?",
    "figure [ lumin ] shows the diffuse 8  luminosity scaled by the total stellar mass as a function of host galaxy metallicity ( a ) and current star formation rate ( b ) .",
    "the total stellar mass was inferred from the 4.5 luminosity as described in @xcite , and the adopted distances to the galaxies in our sample are from @xcite .",
    "the diffuse 8  fluxes for our sample are plotted in all figures regardless of if diffuse 8  emission is obvious in the images .",
    "this figure shows that lower metallicity systems do in fact have disproportionately less diffuse 8  than more metal - rich objects .",
    "figure [ 3corr ] shows the diffuse 8  absolute magnitudes versus absolute b magnitude , nebular metallicity , and current star formation rate ( sfr ) as measured by their h@xmath5 fluxes [ adopting distances and sfrs from @xcite and a channel 4 magnitude zero point of 64.1 jy ; @xcite ] for each target in our sample .",
    "all three quantities are correlated with the diffuse 8  flux . in figure",
    "[ 3groups ] we plot the absolute diffuse 8  magnitude versus oxygen abundance and current star formation rate , along with the data of @xcite and @xcite .    to date",
    ", the outstanding question has been whether it is the decreasing metal content or the decreasing number of high energy photons capable of heating / exciting the dust and pah molecules into emission that is responsible for the decrease in hot dust / pah emission .",
    "spatially resolved observations here indicate that both of these effects are important .",
    "for example , ic  1613 and wlm have very similar gross properties . despite these systems having the same current star formation rate , ic",
    "1613 shows prominent diffuse 8  emission , while wlm has only low surface brightness emission .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the current star formation is spread over a large area in wlm , while it is concentrated in a single  region in ic  1613 .",
    "this points to the fact that even though these objects have the same sfr , the density of uv radiation in the star forming region of ic  1613 must be higher than in those of wlm .",
    "thus , we observe prominent diffuse 8  emission in ic  1613 and not in wlm , even though the nebular metallicity of wlm is 0.2 dex higher .    in comparison , sextans  a appears to have even weaker diffuse 8  emission than wlm , although the foreground star in sextans  a makes a numerical comparison impossible .",
    "again , these objects have nearly the same gross properties ( sextans  a has a slightly lower sfr , but the distribution of  regions are similar ) , however , sextans  a has a significantly lower metallicity , which is likely the cause of the difference in diffuse 8  emission between these two objects",
    ".      there is evidence to suggest that there may be more factors involved than just the radiation field and metallicity of these objects .",
    "@xcite found dust - to - gas ratios in dwarf galaxies to vary by as much as a factor of 10 _ at a given metallicity_. while we do not want to over - interpret dust mass estimates derived from a single - temperature blackbody fit to two data points , their data suggest a large variation in the dust content between galaxies with very similar gross characteristics .",
    "perhaps it should come as no surprise then , that we also see a large variation in the hot dust / pah emission .",
    "still , the issue of what is responsible for the general drop in hot dust / pah emission in low - metallicity systems remains .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed mid - ir spectroscopy of the very low - metallicity galaxy sbs 0335 - 052 .",
    "@xcite conclude that pah emission is not seen in this galaxy because it is extremely young and the stars that will eventually become agb stars and enrich",
    "the ism with carbon have not yet evolved .",
    "the same explanation for other galaxies was offered by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "while a young galaxy age may explain the lack of pah emission in sbs 0335 - 052 and some other systems , this can not be true for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "since all of the objects in our sample formed the bulk of their stars over 2 gyr ago @xcite , the agb has been well populated and therefore the lack of agb stars can not be responsible for the absence of pah emission in local group dwarfs .",
    "a possibility proposed by @xcite for the dearth of hot dust / pah emission in low metallicity systems is that the gravitational potential of these systems is not sufficiently large to retain dust and pah molecules against the effects of vigorous star formation .",
    "we are able to address this possibility directly , since high - resolution  imaging has been performed for the majority of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "high - resolution  imaging has been published for 10 of the 15 targets in our sample [ @xcite for ddo  210 , ddo  216 , leo  a , lgs  3 , and gr  8 ; @xcite for ic  1613 ; @xcite for lgs  3 and phoenix ; @xcite for ngc  3109 ; @xcite for ngc  55 ; @xcite for sextans  a ] and lower - resolution imaging has been done on two additional galaxies [ wlm @xcite and antlia @xcite ] .",
    "it has been established by the high - resolution studies that the  distribution of irregular galaxies tends to be clumpy and irregular in nature , with these clumps not spatially correlated particularly well with the stellar populations of these systems .",
    "also , two of the largest , most massive systems in our sample ( ngc  55 and ngc  3109 ) both exhibit warps in their  disks , which have been attributed to interactions with other nearby dwarf galaxies . in only two of the galaxies in our sample is there any evidence that the stellar population is responsible for expelling the ambient ism .",
    "@xcite found a double - peaked structure in the distribution of wlm , which they believed might be due to a partial blowout , but high - resolution  imaging is required to confirm this result .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected multiple  clouds near phoenix and @xcite concluded one of these components was likely associated with the galaxy .",
    "this was confirmed by optical velocity measurements by @xcite and @xcite who both suggested the  was blown out , though the loss of  by ram - pressure stripping was also possible .",
    "other than the evidence for these two objects , we have no reason to believe blowouts have occurred in the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the removal of ism from a galaxy by a burst of star formation certainly occurs in some systems .",
    "there is ample evidence from ly@xmath5 absorption features in the spectra of distant quasars @xcite that metals have been ejected from galaxies into the intergalactic medium .",
    "there are also many direct observations of galaxies currently undergoing this type of event ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "however , there are also numerous observations that pose serious problems to outflows of this kind _ commonly _ occurring in dwarfs . @xcite and @xcite describe these observations in detail .",
    "the observations presented in this work propose an additional question : if blowouts are responsible for the lack of dust / pahs in low - mass galaxies , how did these blowouts manage to remove the dust / pahs _ without having any impact on the  _ . or alternatively , if our sample is unique in that these galaxies have not experienced blowout , how can our diffuse 8 luminosities fit the correlations observed by others so well ? based on the sum of this evidence",
    "we conclude that blowouts can not solely be responsible for the lack of diffuse 8  emission in the dwarfs in our sample .",
    "our results are consistent with models by @xcite of intermediate- and low - mass galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation which show that a significant fraction of the gas will be removed only in galaxies with m@xmath19 @xmath15 10@xmath20 m@xmath21 .",
    "because this very low gas mass is more consistent with ism - deficient ` transition galaxies ' than with typical dwarf irregulars we do not believe this process is _ generally _",
    "responsible for the lack of hot dust / pah emission in star forming dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "more recently , in their study of starburst galaxies @xcite find a strong anti - correlation between the [ ] / [ ] ratio ( which can be a tracer of supernova activity ) and pah luminosity .",
    "they attribute this anti - correlation to the destruction of pah molecules by supernova shocks , and postulate that quiescent ( i.e. , star - forming but non - bursting ) dwarf galaxies such as those in our sample may have stronger pah emission than in starburst galaxies .",
    "since this prediction is not confirmed by our observations , we have considered what physical mechanisms other than the destruction of pahs by supernova driven shocks could lead to the strong anti - correlations between [ ] / [ ] and both pah strength and metallicity .",
    "we note that a strong correlation also exists between [ ] / [ ] and [ ] / [ ] which is understood simply as the change in the ionization fraction of ne in the warm ism as a function of metallicity .",
    "this correlation can easily explain the two other correlations observed . however , the destruction of pahs and dust grains by supernova shocks could help partly explain the lack of pah and hot dust emission in these systems .    an important issue in understanding the diffuse emission at 8 is the actual growth site of pah molecules and dust grains in the ism .",
    "the idea that dust grains must predominantly be grown through processes in the ism rather than in the winds of individual evolved stars has been discussed for some time @xcite .",
    "their calculations show that in the galaxy , the mean timescale of a metal atom in a grain ( @xmath22 ) is of order 3@xmath310@xmath23 yr , while the mean ` residence time ' of a metal atom in the ism ( @xmath24 ) is @xmath010@xmath25 yr . the ratio @xmath22/(@xmath26 ) describes the fraction of stardust that would be found in the original stardust particle ( a value of 1 means all of the atoms in a grain have been there since the creation of the grain in the stellar wind , while a value of 0 means the grain has been completely rebuilt in the ism ) . using galactic values",
    ", @xcite finds a ratio of 0.2 , meaning only 20% of the atoms will be found in their original stardust particle .",
    "accordingly , the question becomes how does this value depend on the metallicity of the host galaxy ?",
    "we can not directly compare the result of the @xcite calculation to the galaxies in our sample because of a lack of simulations on the effects of supernovae and other energetic processes in low - metallicity dwarf galaxies .",
    "this lack of detailed simulations is quite understandable , given how little is known about the content of the ism ( especially dust and molecular gas ) in these objects .",
    "however , studies on the evolution of the multi - phase ism give us some insight into possible causes of the drastically different dust content observed between massive spirals and dwarfs .",
    "simulations by @xcite show the formation of molecular gas and giant molecular clouds is suppressed below metallicities of z @xmath0 0.03  -  0.1 z@xmath27 ( or roughly 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.1 - 7.7 , assuming a solar value of 12 + log(o / h ) = 8.66 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suppression is due to species such as c , o , and co not being sufficiently abundant to cool the gas to temperatures necessary to form molecular hydrogen .",
    "additionally , observations show an abrupt drop in co content with metallicity , with no co having been detected in any galaxy with 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath28 7.9 @xcite .",
    "the lack of co in low - metallicity systems is normally attributed to the inability of low - metallicity systems to self - shield against dissociating radiation , which shrinks the co core of a molecular cloud , but leaves the h@xmath29 unaffected @xcite .",
    "this results in the increase of the co - to - h@xmath29 conversion factor ( x@xmath30 ) that has been observed in local group dwarfs @xcite .    together",
    ", these studies point to a fundamental change in the phase and content of the ism below 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath0 8 ( or roughly 20% of solar metallicity ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is the value @xcite find to be the dividing line between systems with pah features detected compared to the continuum , and those without . if at low - metallicity",
    ", c , o , and co are not sufficiently abundant to provide cooling for molecular cloud formation , and co is also more easily dissociated due to the lack of dust to shield it , then the overall content or filling - factor of molecular gas should decrease in lower - metallicity systems . consequently , because grain growth in the ism can only take place in cool , dense , molecular clouds @xcite , the timescale to regrow grains must be significantly longer in low - metallicity systems .",
    "in contrast , there is no corresponding change with metallicity in the stellar population , which is primarily responsible for grain destruction .",
    "therefore , if dust grains are predominantly grown in the ism rather than in the winds of individual stars , we would expect a much lower total dust mass ( compared to the total galaxy mass ) at low - metallicity than in the galaxy .",
    "given a long timescale to regrow grains , the lack of diffuse 8  emission could be due to the destruction of dust by not just recent supernovae , but supernovae occurring throughout the evolution of a galaxy .",
    "future far - ir imaging of the dust distributions of dwarf galaxies as well as galex uv imaging will help elucidate how the radiation fields and overall dust distributions relate to the diffuse 8  emission observed , as well as the evolution of dust grains .",
    "however , ir spectra are also needed to determine whether we are in fact seeing the emission from hot dust , pahs , or both .",
    "we have shown the spatially resolved distributions of diffuse 8  emission for 15 local group and other nearby galaxies .",
    "we detect prominent emission from ngc  55 , ic  5152 , ngc  3109 , and ic 1613 , low surface brightness emission from ddo  216 , sextans  a , sextans  b , wlm , and in the remaining systems ( antlia , ddo  210 , gr  8 , leo  a , lgs  3 , phoenix , ugca  438 ) we observe no diffuse emission .",
    "these data are the first spatially resolved images of diffuse 8  emission from such low - metallicity objects ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath07.5 for sextans  a and sextans  b ) .",
    "we find that both the nebular metallicities and the strength of the uv radiation field appear to play important roles in the generation of this emission .",
    "still , other galaxy properties such as the total dust content and the fact that the global current star formation rate is not necessarily a good tracer of the strength of the uv radiation field in individual star forming regions may complicate matters .",
    "further , we propose that the lack of emission from hot dust and pahs may be due to the combined effects of their destruction by supernova shocks , coupled with their inability to be regrown in the ism .    finally , our ability to highly resolve these objects at other wavelengths allows us to rule out some physical causes for the lack of diffuse 8  emission .",
    "the presence of a solely young stellar population that has not had enough time to produce the necessary ism components is ruled out by detailed star formation histories which show that all of the galaxies in our sample formed the bulk of their stars over 2 gyr ago .",
    "likewise , blowout of the ambient ism by vigorous star formation can not be responsible for the lack of diffuse 8  emission in our sample of galaxies , since  studies of these objects show no evidence of this .",

    "<S> we present  space telescope 4.5 and 8.0  imaging of 15 local group and nearby dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the diffuse 8 micron emission is spatially correlated with regions of active star formation in these spatially resolved galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our sample spans a range of more than one dex in nebular metallicity and over three orders of magnitude in current star formation rate , allowing us to examine the dependence of the diffuse 8  emission , originating from hot dust and pahs , on these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we detect prominent diffuse 8  emission in four of the most luminous galaxies in the sample ( ic  1613 , ic  5152 , ngc  55 , and ngc  3109 ) , low surface brightness emission from four others ( ddo  216 , sextans  a , sextans  b , wlm ) , and no diffuse emission from the remaining objects . </S>",
    "<S> these data are the first spatially resolved images of diffuse 8  emission from such low - metallicity objects ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath07.5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe general correlations of the diffuse 8  emission with both the current star formation rate and the nebular metallicity of the galaxies in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also see exceptions to these correlations that suggest other processes may also have a significant effect on the generation of hot dust / pah emission . </S>",
    "<S> these systems all have evidence for old and intermediate age star formation , thus the lack of diffuse 8  emission can not be attributed to young galaxy ages . also , we find that winds are unlikely to explain the paucity of diffuse 8  emission , since high resolution imaging of the neutral gas in these objects show no evidence of blowout . additionally , we propose the lack of diffuse 8  emission in low - metallicity systems may be due to the destruction of dust grains by supernova shocks , assuming the timescale to regrow dust grains and pah molecules is long compared to the destruction timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely explanation for the observed weak diffuse 8  emission is at least partly due to a general absence of dust ( including pahs ) , in agreement with their low metallicities . </S>"
