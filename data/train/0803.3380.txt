    "however , the results for ho(co@xmath13al@xmath14)@xmath5 reveal a much stronger dependence of @xmath10 on the lattice parameter ( fig.[t - dcorr]a ) , implying that some additional factor is responsible for the narrowing of the peak width and increase of @xmath11 .",

    "this indicates , in agreement with our results , that lattice expansion can not be the main cause for the magnetic enhancement of the alloys . on the other hand , the 3_d _ band de - population model",

    "the results show that the mechanism , which causes the decrease of @xmath7 in non - magnetic compounds ( or increase of @xmath11 in the magnetic ones ) does depend at small _ x _ neither on the type of substituting element nor on the lattice expansion . what all above mentioned alloys have in common , is disorder within the co - sublattice due the substitution of co by other elements .",
    "we therefore conclude , that the principal reason for the narrowing of the 3_d _ band in ho(co@xmath13al@xmath14)@xmath5 for low al contents , is the increasing localization of the 3_d _ electrons caused by disorder within co - sublattice .",
    "experimental results on transport in y(co@xmath13al@xmath14)@xmath5 alloys has led us to a similar conclusion @xcite .",
    "a different situation takes place when the impurity element has unfilled 3_d_-shell , like ni and fe , in that case the effects of the change of 3_d _ electron concentration play a dominant role @xcite .    of course",
    ", one can not exclude a change of the 3_d _ electron concentration upon the co - substitution in ho(co@xmath13al@xmath14)@xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the decrease of @xmath9 values in the paramagnetic temperature region , as will be demonstrated later , implies such a change .",
    "it also follows from literature that the behavior of y(co@xmath13_m_@xmath14)@xmath5 alloys at large _",
    "( above about 0.1 ) , such as the stabilization of a ferromagnetic ground state , depends on the kind of substituting elements , suggesting a hybridization of _ s  p _ and 3_d _ states .",
    "however , our analysis shows that the change of the 3_d _ electron concentration does not play major role in magnetic enhancement of diluted alloys .    to summarize this part ,",
    "our experimental results on transport properties of ho(co@xmath13al@xmath14)@xmath5 alloys and analysis of the results , reported in the literature , led us to the conclusion that the principal mechanism , responsible for the increase of @xmath11 in magnetic alloys , or a decrease of @xmath7 in paramagnetic alloys , is the narrowing of the 3_d _ dos peak due to localization of co 3_d _ electron states , induced by disorder in co sublattice of the alloys .",
    "the rapid increase of the residual resistivity and the modest variation of high temperature resistivity with al content are the most characteristic features observed in the resistivity of the alloys .",
    "the temperature dependent part of the resistivity systematically decreases with _ x _ as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ tdepr ] .",
    "we should note that such behavior is common for many _ r_co@xmath5 - based alloys @xcite , which include both , _ r_(co@xmath13_m_@xmath14)@xmath5 and y@xmath13_r_@xmath14co@xmath5 systems .",

    "however , there has been no commonly accepted model , able to account for the observed variation of the temperature dependent resistivity .",
    "the independence of the phenomenon on the constituents of the alloys implies a common mechanism . as in the case of the above",
    "discussed co - localization , disorder and metamagnetism of the magnetic co subsystem are the natural candidates .",
    "baranov et al .",
    "@xcite were probably the first to emphasize the important role , which disorder can play in _ r_co@xmath5 - based alloys . in a certain range of alloy composition",
    ", 3_d _ magnetic subsystem can be in `` partially '' ordered ground state , i.e. in the alloy there are spatial regions with high and low 3_d _ magnetization .",
    "this static magnetic disorder originates from a combination of fluctuating exchange field ( in ( y@xmath34_r_@xmath14)co@xmath6 alloys ) , or fluctuating local susceptibility ( in _ r_(co@xmath13_m_@xmath14)@xmath5 alloys ) , and of the metamagnetism of 3_d _ electron system .",
    "scattering of conduction electrons of this static magnetic disorder gives contribution to the alloy resistivity , which is comparable to the high temperature limit of 3_d _ spin fluctuation ( sf ) resistivity ( the resistivity due to scattering on dynamic , i.e. temperature - induced , fluctuations of local 3_d _ magnetization ) in _ r_co@xmath5 compounds @xcite .",
    "the static magnetic disorder can be viewed as `` frozen '' sf .",
    "when temperature increases this frozen disorder melts and is replaced by the dynamic disorder . since the corresponding contributions to resistivity",
    "are of similar magnitude , the temperature variation of the total resistivity is considerably reduced .",

    "the kind of the phase transition at curie point is changed from first to second order around @xmath11=@xmath10 .",
    "this is another manifestation that @xmath10 is an essential physical parameter , directly reflecting dos features .",
    "the relation between @xmath10 and the change of the transition order follows from the model of the metamagnetic transition of co subsystem @xcite as a consequence of the temperature smearing of dos features at the fermi level @xcite .",

    "essentially the same mechanism leads to the development of the minima in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "there is , however , an alternative theoretical model , in which the order of a magnetic phase transition depends basically on the lattice constant value @xcite . since the width of the dos peak ( and",
    ", therefore , @xmath10 ) is determined in pure _ r_co@xmath5 compounds by the lattice parameter , @xmath39 represents a more general condition for the boundary between second and first order phase transition in these compounds .",
    "the magnitude of the resistivity drop at the curie temperature @xmath40 decreases as @xmath11 approaches @xmath10 .",

    "[ resrel ] .",
    "the resistivity drop at @xmath11 of heavy _ r_co@xmath5 compounds , which exhibit a first - order transition , has been attributed to a sudden suppression of sf by strong molecular field of the ordered 4_f _",
    "moments @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not explain the decrease of @xmath40 with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "we propose that the origin of this decrease is the same as the origin of resistivity saturation of nearly magnetic compounds at high temperatures @xcite . in the model ,",
    "put forth in @xcite by ueda and moriya , the sf contribution to the resistivity ( @xmath41 ) is determined by the _",
    "d _ band dynamical susceptibility , which is enhanced due to _ d _ band sf .",
    "it has been shown that the saturation tendency , which is characteristic for the temperature dependent resistivity of nearly magnetic materials , originates from the strong decrease of the _ d _ band enhancement owing to interactions among sf at high temperatures .",
    "we use here a very simplified model with a rectangular approximation for the co 3_d _ dos ( fig .",

    "result in fluctuations of local magnetization , i.e. sf . according to @xcite the magnitude of the local magnetization fluctuations @xmath42 increases with temperature",
    ", however it saturates at a constant value in a high temperature limit .",
    "both , the saturation value and cross - over temperature , are determined by the 3_d _ band parameters .    in magnetic _ r_co@xmath5 compounds the 3_d _ system at _",
    "t_=0  k is in high magnetization state . in the following we consider 3_d _ band in this case as fully polarized by the exchange field of ordered 4_f _ moments , as it schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ mdos]*b * , with saturation magnetic moment @xmath43 . as temperature increases",
    ", there will be also temperature - induced fluctuations of the 3_d _ magnetization around this polarized state .    for our qualitative model",
    "we assume that the sf resistivity is determined by the spin ",
    "spin correlation function @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the local 3_d _ magnetization at lattice point with coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , and @xmath49 is distance of order of conduction electron ( s  electron ) mean free path .",
    "the scattering magnitude of conduction electron by a magnetic fluctuation is proportional to its squared magnitude , measured relative to the local background at a distance of order of conduction electron mean free path .",
    "therefore , the most effective will be the scattering on correlated magnetic fluctuations with largest difference of local magnetization at points @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
