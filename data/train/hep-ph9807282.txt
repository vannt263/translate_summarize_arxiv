    "one may try to invent arguments in order to avoid the upper bound on the neutrino flux by hypothesizing strong magnetic fields , which would affect the propagation of cosmic - ray protons , either in the neutrino source or in the inter - galactic medium between the source and the earth .",
    "we show in this section that magnetic fields in the source can not affect the upper bound , and that observational constraints on inter - galactic magnetic fields imply that proposed field scenarios also do not affect the upper bound .",
    "one might try to argue that the upper bound @xmath24 can be avoided even for sources with small photo - meson optical depth , if protons are prevented from escaping the source by magnetic confinement .",
    "however , a photo - meson interaction producing a charged pion also converts the proton to a neutron , which is not magnetically confined and will escape a source with small photo - meson optical depth before decaying to a proton .",
    "a neutron of high energy @xmath38 propagates a distance @xmath57 prior to its decay .",
    "thus , magnetic fields within the neutrino source can not be used to evade the upper bound given in eq .",

    "the existence of uniformly distributed inter - galactic magnetic fields may limit the propagation distance of protons and therefore prevent their arrival at earth from distant sources .",
    "however , imposing a limit on the propagation distance of cosmic - rays will not affect any of the arguments presented in this paper .",
    "compare , e.g. , the case where protons propagate on straight lines to the case where cosmic rays are confined by magnetic fields to their place of origin . in the former case , the present proton flux is obtained by integrating the contribution of distant sources over redshift , while in the latter case it is obtained by integrating the contribution from local sources over cosmic time .",
    "for a homogeneous universe both procedures yield the same result [ e.g. the integration in eq .",
    "( [ zint ] ) may be interpreted as integration over redshift or over time ] .",
    "thus , limiting the cosmic - ray propagation distance may affect the upper bound @xmath24 only if propagation is limited to a distance @xmath58 over which the cosmic ray production rate , averaged over a hubble time , is inhomogeneous . in this case , if the cosmic - ray production rate in our local region of size @xmath58 is lower than the universe average , the observed cosmic - ray flux would be lower than average and the neutrino flux , which is homogeneous throughout the universe , may exceed a bound based on the local cosmic - ray flux .",
    "however , the magnetic fields required to make such a scenario viable , i.e. to confine cosmic rays to small enough @xmath58 to significantly affect @xmath24 , are large and are inconsistent with observations .    consider a proton of energy @xmath38 propagating through an intergalactic magnetic field of strength @xmath59 and correlation length @xmath60 .",
    "propagating a distance @xmath60 the proton is deflected by an angle @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the larmor radius . for the parameters of interest ( see below ) the deflection angle is small , and propagating a distance @xmath63 the proton is deflected by an angle @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we may define an effective mean free path , the propagation distance over which large deflection occurs , by @xmath65 and a diffusion coefficient for proton propagation , @xmath66 . for a propagation time @xmath67 , protons are confined to a region of size @xmath68 . for @xmath69  yr , we have @xmath70  gpc .",
    "the propagation distance is determined by the product @xmath71 .",
    "the upper limit on the intergalactic magnetic field implied by qso faraday rotation measurements , @xmath72 @xcite , implies @xmath73  gpc .",
    "we conclude that the existence of a uniformly distributed inter - galactic magnetic field would have no effect on @xmath24 .",
    "the discussion in the previous subsections shows that magnetic field in the source or a uniformly distributed inter - galactic field would not affect the upper bound @xmath24 .",
    "could magnetic fields associated with large scale galaxy structures , i.e. clusters , filaments and sheets , affect the upper bound ?",
    "let us first consider galaxy clusters , where inter - galactic fields had been detected .",
    "the analysis of rotation measures of radio sources lying in the background of rich clusters implies the existence of strong fields between galaxies , @xmath74 g with @xmath75  kpc , in the central @xmath76  mpc , cluster region @xcite .",
    "however , confinement of high energy protons in the cores of rich clusters would have little effect on our results , unless most of the high energy neutrino sources reside in the centers of rich clusters , which is not the case for either the hypothesized agn or grb neutrino sources .",
    "moreover , high - energy protons can not be confined even in the central regions of a rich cluster , since for @xmath74 g and @xmath75  kpc we have @xmath77  mpc over a hubble time .",
    "we next turn to large - scale filaments / sheets .",
    "@xcite has recently suggested that magnetic fields could be amplified by turbulence associated with the formation of large scale filaments and sheets to near equipartition with turbulent kinetic energy . for characteristic turbulent velocities of @xmath78 on @xmath79  mpc scale , and characteristic filament / sheet densities of @xmath80 ,",
    "this scenario predicts magnetic fields @xmath81 in the high density large scale filaments / sheets , with coherence length @xmath82  mpc , comparable to the filament ( sheet ) diameter ( thickness ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the suggested scenario for increase in magnetic field strength and coherence length to equipartition with the largest turbulent eddies can be realized .",
    "furthermore , even for a turbulent velocity of order several hundreds km per sec , the turn - around time of a @xmath83  mpc eddy is longer than the hubble time , and it is therefore not clear whether equipartition with the largest scale is achievable .",
    "nevertheless , we consider this scenario here since it is consistent with the upper limit , @xmath84 , implied for a field coherent over @xmath79  mpc inside high density large scale structures by qso rotation measures @xcite .",
    "although the larmor radius of a @xmath85  ev proton is smaller than @xmath82  mpc , confinement of particles would require a special field configuration .",
    "even if such a configuration is produced by the random turbulent motions , which seems unlikely , variation of the field over scale @xmath86 gives rise to particle drift velocity , @xmath87 , and therefore to the escape of particles on time scale @xmath88  yr .",
    "since @xmath89 , the hypothesized large - scale structure magnetic fields can not affect the bound on neutrino flux .",
    "finally , we note that several authors have recently considered cosmic - ray proton propagation in an hypothesized large scale magnetic field , associated with our local super - cluster , of @xmath90 strength and 10 mpc coherence length corresponding to a hypothetical local turbulent eddy of comparable size @xcite . for these parameters as well we have @xmath89 , and therefore even this field structure would not affect the neutrino bound .",
    "nevertheless , two points should be made .",
    "first , if cosmic - rays are confined to our local super - cluster , one would expect the local cosmic - ray flux to be higher than average ( since the production rate averaged over hubble time should be higher than average in over - dense large scale regions ) , implying that the upper bound on the neutrino intensity is lower than @xmath24 derived here .",
    "second , it is hard to understand how the hypothesized magnetic field structure could have been formed .",
    "the overdensity in the local super - cluster is not large and an equipartition magnetic field of strength @xmath90 therefore corresponds to a turbulent velocity @xmath91 .",
    "a turbulent eddy of this velocity coherent over tens of mpc is inconsistent with local peculiar velocity measurements ( e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "moreover , the corresponding eddy turn around time is larger than the hubble time .",
    "we consider in this section some popular models for neutrino production in which high - energy neutrinos are produced in the jets of active galactic nuclei @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the flux of high - energy neutrinos received at earth is produced by `` blazars '' , agn jets nearly aligned with our line of sight . since the predicted neutrino intensities for these models exceed by typically two orders of magnitude the upper bound , eq .",
    "( [ fmax ] ) , based on observed cosmic ray fluxes , it is important to verify that the models satisfy the assumption on which eq .",
    "( [ fmax ] ) is based , i.e. optical depth @xmath92 to @xmath7 interaction .",
    "the neutrino spectrum and flux are derived in agn jet models on the basis of the following key considerations .",
    "it is assumed that protons are fermi accelerated in the jet to high energy , with energy spectrum @xmath93 . for a photon spectrum @xmath94 , as typically observed , the number of photons with energy above the threshold for pion production is proportional to the proton energy @xmath95 ( the threshold energy is inversely proportional to @xmath95 ) .",
    "this implies that the proton photo - meson optical depth is proportional to @xmath95 , and therefore , assuming that the optical depth is small , that the resulting neutrino spectrum is flatter than the proton spectrum , namely @xmath96 , as shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum extends to a neutrino energy which is @xmath97 of the maximum accelerated proton energy , which is typically @xmath13ev in the models discussed .",
    "the production of charged pions is accompanied by the production of neutral pions , whose decay leads to the emission of high - energy gamma- rays .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that the observed blazar emission extending to @xmath98  tev @xcite supports the hypothesis that the high - energy emission is due to neutral pion decay rather then to inverse compton scattering by electrons .",
    "thus , the normalization of the neutrino flux is determined by the assumption that neutral pion decay is the source of high - energy photon emission and that this emission from agn jets produces the observed diffuse @xmath99-ray background , @xmath100 @xcite . under these assumptions",
    "the total neutrino energy flux is similar to the @xmath99-ray background flux ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in the agn jet models discussed above ,",
    "the proton photo - meson optical depth @xmath101 at @xmath102ev is smaller than unity .",
    "this is evident from the neutrino energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "1 , which is flatter than the assumed proton spectrum at @xmath102 , as explained above . in fact",
    ", it is easy to see that these models are constrained to have @xmath103 at @xmath104ev .",
    "the threshold energy of photons for pair - production in interaction with a 1  tev photon is similar to the photon energy required for resonant meson production in interaction with a proton of energy @xmath105  ev .",
    "emission of @xmath79  tev photons from blazars is now well established @xcite , and there is evidence that the high - energy photon spectrum extends as a power - law at least to @xmath98  tev @xcite .",
    "this is the main argument used @xcite in support of the hypothesis that high - energy emission from blazars is due to pion decay rather than inverse compton scattering .",
    "the observed high - energy emission implies that the pair - production optical depth for @xmath79  tev photons is small , and that @xmath106 , since the cross section for pair production is @xmath107 times larger than the cross section for photo - meson production .",
    "this result guarantees that the upper bound @xmath24 on the neutrino intensity is valid for agn jet models .",
    "in the grb fireball model for high - energy neutrinos , the cosmic ray observations are naturally taken into account and the upper limit on high energy neutrino flux is automatically satisfied .",
    "in fact , it was the similarity between the energy density in cosmic ray sources implied by the cosmic ray flux observations and the grb energy density in high energy protons that led to the initial suggestion that grbs are the the source of high energy protons .",
    "just as for agn jets , the grb fireballs are optically think to @xmath99- p interactions that produce pions but  unlike the agn jet models  the grb model predicts a neutrino flux that satisfies the cosmic - ray upper bound discussed in section ii .      in the grb fireball model @xcite , which has recently gained support from grb afterglow observations @xcite , the observed",
    "gamma rays are produced by synchrotron emission of high - energy electrons accelerated in internal shocks of an expanding relativistic wind , with characteristic lorentz factor @xmath109 @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "observed gamma - ray flux variability on time scale @xmath110 is produced by internal collisions at radius @xmath111 that arise from variability of the underlying source on the same time scale @xcite . in the region where electrons are accelerated , protons are also expected to be shock accelerated , and their photo - meson interaction with observed burst photons will produce a burst of high - energy neutrinos accompanying the grb @xcite . if grbs are the sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic - rays @xcite , then the expected grb neutrino intensity is @xcite @xmath112 here , @xmath113 is the fraction of energy lost to pion production by high - energy protons .",
    "the derivation of @xmath113 and @xmath114 and their dependence on grb model parameters is given in the appendix [ eqs .",

    "@xcite we neglected the logarithmic correction @xmath116 of eq .",
    "( [ ecr ] ) .    the grb neutrino intensity can be estimated directly from the observed gamma - ray fluence .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) measures the grb fluence @xmath117 over a decade of photon energy , @xmath118mev to @xmath79mev , corresponding to half a decade of radiating electron energy ( the electron synchrotron frequency is proportional to the square of the electron lorentz factor ) .",
    "if electrons carry a fraction @xmath119 of the energy carried by protons , then the muon neutrino fluence of a single burst is @xmath120 .",
    "the average neutrino flux per unit time and solid angle is obtained by multiplying the single burst fluence with the grb rate per solid angle , @xmath121 bursts per year over @xmath122  sr . using the average burst fluence @xmath123",
    ", we obtain a muon neutrino intensity @xmath124 .",
    "recent grb afterglow observations typically imply @xmath125 @xcite , and therefore @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the neutrino intensity estimated directly from the gamma - ray fluence agrees with the estimate ( [ jgrb ] ) based on the cosmic - ray production rate .",
    "the neutrino spectrum ( [ jgrb ] ) is modified at high energy , where neutrinos are produced by the decay of muons and pions whose life time @xmath128 exceeds the characteristic time for energy loss due to adiabatic expansion and synchrotron emission @xcite .",

    "this , and the fact that the adiabatic loss time is independent of energy and the synchrotron loss time is inversely proportional to energy , imply that synchrotron losses are the dominant effect suppressing the flux at high energy .",

    "the neutrino intensity and spectrum produced in the external shock are given by equations ( [ jgrb],[fpi],[sync ] ) with @xmath152s .",

    "the neutrino flux predictions of agn jet models are based on two key assumptions , namely that agn jets produce the observed gamma - ray background and that high - energy photon emission from agn jets is due to decay of neutral pions produced in photo - meson interactions of protons accelerated in the jet to high energy . since the neutrino flux predicted by these assumptions is two orders of magnitude higher than the upper bound allowed by cosmic ray observations ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , at least one of the key assumptions is not valid , presumably the assumption that high - energy photon emission from agn jets is due to photo - meson interactions .",
    "this conclusion is supported by multi - wavelength observations of the blazar mkn 421 , which show contemporaneous strong variability at tev and x - ray energies with little evidence for gev and optical variability @xcite .",
    "this behavior suggests that the high - energy photon emission is due to inverse - compton scattering by relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "even if agns produce part of their high energy emission through @xmath167 interactions , the upper bound derived here implies an upper bound of @xmath79 detected agn neutrino per year in a high - energy neutrino telescope with an effective area of @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "the discussion in this paper shows that there is no observational motivation that would lead one to expect that the flux of high - energy neutrinos from agns will be measurable in a @xmath169 telescope .",
    "the upper bound eq .",
    "( [ fmax ] ) also applies to the intensity of high - energy neutrinos that may be produced through the decay of charged pions created by @xmath170 ( rather than @xmath7 ) interactions , as long as the @xmath171 optical depth in the source is not large . at present , predictions of high - energy neutrino flux based on such models are not available in the literature .    the cosmic - ray flux below @xmath172  ev is steeper than at higher energy .",
    "this is most likely due @xcite to a contribution to the cosmic - ray flux at lower energy from galactic sources of heavy ions .",
    "this view has recently gained support from the detection in the fly s eye data of a small but statistically significant enhancement of the flux of cosmic - rays in the energy range of @xmath173  ev to @xmath172  ev along the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "extra - galactic sources of cosmic - rays may therefore exist that produce cosmic - rays with energy @xmath174ev at a rate higher than given by eq .",
    "( [ ecr ] ) . while we have no observational evidence for the existence of such sources , we can not rule them out based on cosmic - ray observations , and they may produce a flux of @xmath175  ev neutrinos which is higher than the upper limit implied by eq .",
    "( [ fmax ] ) .",
    "note that this argument does not affect the validity of the upper bound ( [ fmax ] ) for agn models , since the neutrino emission from these sources peaks at @xmath36  ev .",
    "the neutrino flux predicted by the grb model is consistent with the upper bound derived here .",
    "the intensity estimate we give here , eq . ( [ jgrb ] ) , is @xmath115 times smaller than that we gave in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the logarithmic correction of eq .",
    "( [ ecr ] ) was neglected .",
    "the intensity calculated here implies a detection rate of @xmath176 neutrino induced muons per year for a @xmath177 detector ( over @xmath122  sr ) . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", one may look for neutrino events in spatial and temporal coincidence ( on a time scale of seconds ) with grbs .",
    "the grb neutrino spectrum is consistent with the secondary - particle cooling constraints derived by rachen & mszros @xcite",
    ". the neutrino flux above @xmath165ev is suppressed , but this is also consistent with the acceleration of protons to @xmath178ev ( see section vc ) .",
    "finally , we note that the grb neutrino flux discussed here is the flux produced in situ , i.e. within the source .",
    "the energy loss of high - energy protons , @xmath179  ev , through photo - meson production in interaction with microwave background photons would lead to a background neutrino intensity ( which will not be temporally associated with grbs ) comparable to the upper bound shown in fig . 1 at @xmath180  ev .",
    "this flux of high - energy neutrinos should exist regardless of the nature of the high - energy proton sources ( assuming that these sources are indeed extragalactic , see @xcite ) .",

    "the characteristic frequency of synchrotron emission is determined by the characteristic energy of the electrons and by the strength of the magnetic field .",
