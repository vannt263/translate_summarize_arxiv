    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are believed to be highly obscured by dusty dense gas , and this contributes to huge radiative energy in some ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) @xcite .",
    "the central engines of type-2 seyfert galaxies are also likely obscured by optically thick molecular gas , for which a torus - like geometry is often assumed .",
    "however , detailed structures of the ism in deep centers of ulirgs and seyfert galaxies are still unclear .",
    "there are some indirect ways to infer their geometry and distribution using x - ray spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , optical / infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in comparison with model sed assuming the geometry of the torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and optical / infrared absorption lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "( 2004 ) searched the 4.7 @xmath3 m fundamental ro - vibrational band of co in 31 bright local agns , but found no clear signature of absorption features , even in a compton - thick seyfert 2 nucleus , like ngc 1068 . recently , the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) revealed vibration - rotation absorption bands of gaseous c@xmath4h@xmath4 , hcn , and co@xmath4 as well as silicate absorption toward deeply obscured ( u)lirg nuclei @xcite .",
    "the absorption lines of c@xmath4h@xmath4 and hcn suggest the presence of warm ( @xmath5 k ) and dense ( @xmath6 @xmath2 ) gas @xcite .",
    "they suggest that this gas occupies only a small fraction of the nuclear region ( @xmath7 0.01 pc ) near the intrinsic mid - infrared source .",
    "the co absorption features observed in ulirgs are not resolved into individual lines , except iras 08572 + 3915 , therefore the kinematics and structure of the absorbed material are still an open question .",
    "@xcite have found a broad co absorption line toward iras 08572 + 3915 nw using ukirt / cgs4 .",
    "the observations revealed the following features : 1 ) there are several blue - shifted components with @xmath8 km s@xmath9 for the high @xmath10 lines ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 km s@xmath9 and @xmath13 km s@xmath9 and for the low @xmath10 lines ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",

    "3 ) mean temperature of the warm blue - shifted component is about 200 k.    @xcite have also detected the co absorption in iras 08572 + 3915 nw using subaru / ircs .",
    "their results are consistent with those of @xcite , showing a blue - shifted component ( -160 km s@xmath9 ) with the temperature @xmath18 k and cold gas at @xmath19 k at the systematic velocity , assuming lte .",
    "they also claim that there is a red - shifted component ( + 100 km s@xmath9 ) seen in high @xmath10 ( @xmath20 ) lines , implying higher temperature gas ( @xmath21 k ) .",
    "column density of the warm component is @xmath22 @xmath17 .",
    "these observations suggest that the absorption features do not simply arise from a smooth rotating molecular torus , which has been often postulated to explain the type-1 and type-2 agns . however , it is hard to determine the geometry and internal structures of the ism in the central region of the galaxy from this observational information alone .",
    "theoretical models used for sed fitting are phenomenological without kinematical information , therefore we can not compare them with the absorption line observations .    in this paper , we investigate how the observational features suggested by the co absorption in iras-08572 + 3915 nw can be understood in the context of a three - dimensional hydrodynamic model of the ism around a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with nuclear starbursts @xcite ( hereafter wn02 ) .",
    "this is currently a unique model of the obscuring material around a smbh on a several tens pc scale , characterized by a highly inhomogeneous , multi - phase , and turbulent ism with a globally stable , geometrically thick structure .",
    "three - dimensional radiative transfer calculations for this model revealed that co luminosity distribution is also highly non - uniform @xcite .",
    "although this is not a confirmed theoretical model applicable to the obscuring matter in all types of agns , it is worth verifying whether the features observed in the co absorption lines in the ulirg can be explained by the full 3-d hydrodynamic models .",
    "in the wn02 model , mass , momentum , and energy conservation equations with the poisson equation are numerically solved with energy feedback from supernovae in a fixed gravitational potential .",

    "we use @xmath26 cartesian grid points covering a @xmath27 pc@xmath28 around the galactic center ( i.e. the spatial resolution is 0.25 pc ) .",

    "the initial condition is an axisymmetric and rotationally supported thin disk ( the scale height is 2.5 pc ) with a uniform radial density profile and a total gas mass of @xmath29 .",
    "random density and temperature fluctuations , which are less than 1 % of the unperturbed values , are added to the initial disk .",

    "the average sn rate is @xmath30 0.8 yr@xmath9 .",
    "the energy of @xmath31 ergs is instantaneously injected into a single cell as thermal energy .",
    "thus the three - dimensional evolution of blast waves driven by the sne in an inhomogeneous and non - stationary medium with a global rotation is followed explicitly , taking into account the radiative cooling .",
    "wn02 showed that a globally stable concave `` torus '' , in which the gas is highly turbulent and inhomogeneous , is formed ( see also figure 6 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] is a phase - diagram of the ism in the torus at a quasi - steady state .",
    "three dominant phases present : hot gases around @xmath32 k caused by sne , warm gases around @xmath33 k , and cold , dense gases at @xmath34 k. in terms of the observed co absorption in iras 08572 + 3915 , we are interested in kinematics and spatial location of the cold , dense media .",

    "this difference actually reflects a fact that near / mid - infrared flux is originated from inner a few pc region of the dusty material around the agn .",
    "in fact , a recent 3-d radiative transfer model assuming clumpy dust tori for ngc 1068 @xcite suggests that the outer radius of the torus that fits sed of ngc 1068 is 56 pc , while their h- , k- , and n - band images show their radii are 2.0 - 2.7 pc . in terms of ulirgs , @xcite suggested observed deep absorption features in mid - infrared indicate obscuration on scales of a few 100 pc . probably the obscuring material in the central region of agns and ulirgs",

    "if this is the case , we can expect to observe high velocity , warm components as well as low velocity , cold components as absorption against the background continuum source , whose size is smaller than @xmath54 pc .",
    "the high density gases in those regions have various velocity components , as shown in figure [ fig : vlos - temp ] .",
    "thus it is not necessary to observe only blue - shifted gas .",
    "in fact , @xcite also found a red - shifted gas component ( + 100 km s@xmath9 ) in high-@xmath10 transition , suggesting gas warmer than the blue - shifted component .",
    "one should note that geometry of the `` torus '' in the present model depends on the supernovae rate , total gas mass , and the mass of a smbh , since it is determined from a balance between energy input and dissipation rates under the effect of gravitational potential ( wn02 ) .",
    "therefore , the absolute locations ( i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) of the warm , dense gas around an agn should depend on these parameters .",
    "in the present model of the torus , the high density ( @xmath57 @xmath2 ) gases have both red- and blue - shifted velocity for a line - of - sight .",
    "since a volume fraction of these dense gases is expected to be very small ( see discussion below ) , and the background continuum is emitted from a small region in the vicinity of the central engine , the chance to observe a dense blob with a particular velocity component by an absorption line should be very small .",
    "for example , as shown in figure [ fig : vlos - temp ] , the blue - shifted component around @xmath58 km s@xmath9 exists in about 1/500 of the total volume of the torus whose radius is about 30 pc .",
    "therefore , one possible explanation about the observed blue - shifted component is that the line - of - sight toward the agn happens to graze the high - density clump which is approaching us",
    ". if this is the case , since the motion in the torus is highly turbulent ( wn02 ) , we have nearly equal chance of observing red - shifted warm gas , too .",
    "the red - shifted warm gas found by @xcite may be explained by this picture , but observed samples are still too small to further compare with the model .",
    "recently @xcite proposed a simple statistical theory of the structure of the inhomogeneous gas disk in galactic disks , which is caused by non - linear development of gravitational and thermal instabilities . using three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "they show that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of density @xmath59 in a globally stable , inhomogeneous ism is well represented by a single log - normal function over a wide density range , that is @xmath60 } d \\ln \\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the characteristic density and @xmath62 is the dispersion .",
    "the simulations show that the dispersion of the log - normal pdf is larger for more massive systems . using the pdf , it is straightforward to calculate a volume fraction of high density gas ( @xmath63 ) above a given critical density ( @xmath64 ) : @xmath65\\right)\\;. \\label{eq : fc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dispersion @xmath62 is then related to the average density , @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 it is also suggested that characteristic density @xmath61 is not very sensitive for changing the total gas mass .",
    "suppose the column density toward the continuum source is @xmath68 @xmath17 and the size of the ` torus ' is 30 pc , the average density would be @xmath69 @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , using equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , we have @xmath70 for @xmath71 @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 @xmath2 and @xmath75 @xmath2 , respectively . with this small volume - filling factor of the high - density gas in an obscuring material",
    ", it might be reasonable to expect there is a small chance of detecting a high - density clump with a particular velocity by absorption lines .",
    "@xcite observed 196 agns and ulirgs using _",
    "spitzer_/irs , and found that quasars are characterized by silicate features in emission and seyfert2s are dominated by weak silicate absorption , while ulirgs are characterized by strong silicate absorption .",
    "@xcite suggest that this difference in near - infrared spectra reflects a different geometry of the dusty material .",
    "they claim that clouds dominate the obscuration of seyfert 1s and 2s , while on the other hand , central sources of ulirgs are obscured mainly by smooth , geometrically and optically thick material with a steep temperature gradient . according to @xcite , @xmath76 for the nucleus of iras 08572@xmath773915 estimated by infrared spectra obtained by _",
    "spitzer _ is @xmath78 @xmath17 .",
    "if the scale of the obscuring material is about 30 ( 100 ) pc , the average number density is @xmath79 @xmath2 . using the log - normal density pdf in  3.1",
    ", we can estimate that the volume filling factor of those gases is about 20 ( 30 ) % , suggesting that the dusty gas that contributes to the silicate absorption is more smoothly distributed in the obscuring material than the warm , dense gas found by co absorption .",
    "our result presented here is that at least the co absorbed feature of iras 08572 + 3915 is not inconsistent with a model characterizing a dense clumpy medium around an agn .",
    "since the velocity field of the ism is highly turbulent in the model , if individual high density clumps are not resolved , a broad absorption feature originating in dense gases with various velocity components can be expected in the obscuring material .",
    "if this is the case , the reason why co absorption is not observed in seyfert-2 @xcite can be understood by the low filling factor of the warm , dense gas in the obscuring material . as discussed in  3.1 ,",
    "if average gas density of the obscuring material around agns is smaller in seyfert galaxies than in ulirgs , a fraction of high - density clumps becomes small .",
    "this seems to be inconsistent with the result by @xcite , but probably dusty `` clouds '' in the obscuring material responsible for the near / mid - infrared sed are much more diffuse than those causing the co absorption ( see discussion above ) .",
    "the ism around agns in ulirgs and seyfert galaxies are more or less inhomogeneous , and if so its density pdf is expected to be approximately log - normal .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising , if the `` smooth '' distribution of dusty gas that is preferable to the sed fitting would include higher - density clumps with a smaller volume - filling factor .      in the present hydrodynamic model ,",
    "heating due to the radiation from the agn to dust is not taken into account .",
    "temperatures of optically thick clouds at a distance of a few pc from an agn with @xmath80would be 300 - 1200 k @xcite .",
    "therefore the warm clouds near the surface of the clumpy `` torus '' might be warmer than @xmath81 k , which is a result of the present model .",
    "effects of x - rays are not included in the model either , which would be especially important for chemistry of molecules @xcite .",
    "for highly inhomogeneous media like those seen in figure [ fig : torus ] , hard x - rays could affect not only chemistry of the gas in the vicinity of the central source , but also the clouds inside the `` torus '' , because the column density and the ionization rate are not simply related to the distance from the central source ( wn02 ) .",
    "the effects of x - rays on the abundance and line intensities of co and other molecules are investigated using the present hydrodynamic model and 3-d non - lte radiative transfer calculations ( yamada , wada , & tomisaka , in preparation ) .    as an alternative interpretation of the blue - shifted warm gas",
    "could be originated in outflows from an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole . using two - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", @xcite found that an outflow is driven by radiation force due to a luminous accretion disk .",
    "however , the outflow velocity is extremely large ( @xmath82 ) , and its temperature is @xmath83 k , therefore the outflow from the accretion disk itself does not explain the warm , blue - shifted gases discussed here .",
    "it might be possible however that , the hot outflow gas propagates outward , and it then cools and forms warm , dense cloudlets by the thermal instability at a few pc from the accretion disk",
    ". unfortunately long - term evolution of the outflow from the accretion disk and its interaction with the ism on several tens pc scale is still an open question .",
    "based on the analysis presented here , we could conclude that the blue - shifted , warm , dense molecular gas in iras 08752 + 3915 nw suggested by recent high - resolution observations by subaru / ircs can be caused by high - density clumps in the inhomogeous inter stellar matter around a supermassive black hole .",
    "the small possibility of observing the co absorption in ulirgs and seyfert 2 galaxies could be simply interpreted as indicating that the high density regions occupy a very small volume fraction ( @xmath84 ) in the obscuring material with a turbulent velocity field .",
    "this is naturally expected if the inhomogeneous material is caused by non - linear development of instabilities and random processes ( e.g. stochastic explosions of supernovae and interaction with inhomogeneous ism ) in a globally quasi - stable system .",
    "however , this model is still a presumption until the absorbed features in near infrared spectra of many ulirgs and seyfert 2 galaxies are resolved and details of the kinematics of the obscuring material are clarified by future observations .",
    "it is also necessary to improve numerical models of the ism in the central region of active galaxies by taking into account more realistic treatment of chemical reactions of molecular gas and radiative transfer in terms of agns and star forming regions .",
