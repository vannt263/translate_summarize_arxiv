    "the question of the origin and time evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe is an interesting and so far at best partially resolved problem in cosmology .",

    "@xcite or ref .",
    "a central question then is whether these magnetic fields could evolve with time and transport some of their energy content to large scales to account for the recently claimed detection of intergalactic magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "many attempts to study the evolution of primordial magnetic fields have been performed in the past @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are problematic as they lack the resolution required to give reliable predictions .",
    "a further complication in the study of the evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe is the enormous cosmic expansion between a putative magnetogenesis scenario and the present , such that the smallest errors in extrapolation lead to large changes in the final prediction .    in this paper",
    "we take a semianalytic approach which derives the main time evolution equations from first principles of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , employing some fairly generic assumptions .",
    "our analysis follows a similar procedure as has been already applied to , for example , the solar wind @xcite or the galactic dynamo problem @xcite .",
    "two of us @xcite have recently , for the first time , applied such an approach to the evolution of primordial magnetic fields .",
    "considering only the most important large @xmath3 velocity - magnetic field mode - mode coupling source term to generate magnetic fields on small @xmath3 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and building on the result of banerjee and jedamzik @xcite , it has been established that cosmic expansion seems slow enough to allow for the generation of large - scale magnetic fields with a white noise , i.e. , @xmath5 , or even shallower spectrum , also in the absence of initial magnetic and velocity fields on such large scales @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis is far from complete as the role of back - reaction of the turbulent medium onto the magnetic fields has not been accounted for . here",
    "we present the full analysis including all source and sink terms for nonhelical fields .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : timehomoisomhd ] we give the evolution equations for the magnetic and turbulence fields in the general framework of homogeneous and isotropic noncompressible mhd .",
    "an outline of the lengthy derivation of these equations is delegated to appendix [ app : calc ] , whereas a different form more suitable for numerical integrations is presented in appendix [ app : alternative ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : earlyuniverse ] this is then extended to the situation in the early universe with the results and conclusions from these considerations finally presented in secs .  [",
    "sec : results ] and [ sec : conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "the equations describing the time evolution of the two main observables of magnetohydrodynamics , the velocity field of the turbulent medium @xmath6 and the magnetic field @xmath7 , are , for an incompressible fluid ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) , given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . here",
    "@xmath11 is the conductivity ( which is assumed to be very large in the following ) and @xmath12 the mass density of the fluid , while @xmath13 is some viscous density force .",
    "note that for most part of the evolution of the early universe incompressibility is an excellent assumption due to the large speed of sound in the relativistic plasma .",
    "our main interest lies in the average buildup of magnetic and kinetic energy density , respectively , taken over an ensemble of cosmic realizations ( denoted by chevrons @xmath14 ) , i.e. , @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the magnetic spectral energy defined through @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the kinetic spectral energy given by @xmath19 for both expressions @xmath20 denotes the volume and we have assumed cosmic homogeneity and isotropy which implies that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are functions only of the magnitude @xmath23 of the wave vector @xmath24 . furthermore , parseval s theorem has been used in both cases in order to obtain a @xmath23 integral where a hat denotes the fourier transform normalized by @xmath25 ( cf .",
    "appendix [ app : calc ] ) . with these assumptions",
    "the spectral energy densities are therefore    @xmath26    and @xmath27    by performing the calculations which are presented in appendix [ app : calc ] , we obtain a very general result for the homogeneous and isotropic case which for ( [ dtmdtu ] ) are given by    @xmath28 \\bigg\\ } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and @xmath29 \\bigg\\ } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 , @xmath23 and @xmath30 are the magnitudes of the wave vectors @xmath31 , @xmath24 and @xmath32 , respectively , and @xmath33 is the angle between @xmath31 and @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath34 . equations ( [ dtmqfinalkj ] ) and ( [ dtuqfinalkj ] ) are a set of well - defined equations since they ensure conservation of energy , momentum and mass density to the lowest nontrivial order in @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "in order to study the time evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe we include expansion . for the following considerations it is convenient to introduce the scale factor @xmath36 as the time evolution parameter which in this work is normalized such that it is @xmath37 for the initial conditions , i.e. , at the magnetogenesis era",
    ". the focus here will be on the long radiation dominated period in the early universe where most of the nontrivial evolution occurs .",
    "the derivation of the mhd equations in an expanding universe has , for example , been presented in @xcite .",
    "these equations contain redshifting terms proportional to powers of the scale factor , properly accounting for , e.g. , the physical decrease of magnetic fields , i.e. ,  @xmath38 due to flux - freezing .",
    "these terms are not taken into account in eqs .",
    "( [ dtmqfinalkj ] ) and ( [ dtuqfinalkj ] ) and have to be included now . however , it is known that with a proper scaling of variables ( cf .",
    "appendix b in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ,    @xmath39    the mhd equations in an expanding radiation - dominated universe are form - invariant to the corresponding equations in a static background .",
    "our master equation is therefore also valid in the early universe when these _ comoving _ ( denoted above by a superscript `` c '' ) variables are used .",
    "it is convenient to change the time derivative to a scale factor derivative @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are cosmic time and hubble parameter at the initial magnetogenesis period , respectively .",
    "it is noted here that due to our definition of the fourier transform given in appendix [ app : calc ] , the comoving fourier transforms for @xmath43 and @xmath44 are given by @xmath45 this implies that @xmath46 and @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constant during the expansion of the universe , when dynamical evolution is excluded . in what follows ,",
    "the superscript @xmath50 is dropped and all variables are comoving , unless specifically noted otherwise .",

    "finally , a choice for @xmath35 has to be made .",
    "following methods applied in molecular chaos we choose @xmath35 to be the smallest of all _ eddy _ turnover times , i.e. ,  @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the effective fluid and alfvn velocities on the scale @xmath1 .",

    "note that the first timescale in the brackets of eq .",
    "( [ dt ] ) is supposed to ensure causality , in practice , however , our results are independent of this condition .",
    "with this at hand it is now possible to analyze the time development of both the spectral magnetic and kinetic energy including back - reaction by numerically integrating eqs .",
    "( [ dtmqfinalkjk2 ] ) and ( [ dtuqfinalkjk2 ] ) .",

    "the last result holds even for the case where a @xmath70 , i.e. , an initial white noise turbulent spectrum is assumed .",
    "thus the conclusion concerning the small @xmath3 magnetic tail seems very robust . below analytical arguments are given to support all these results .",
    "the simulations follow very well the proposed evolution of the peak ( i.e. , _ integral _ ) scale @xmath71 with scale factor @xmath36 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if the spectral energy has a slope proportional to @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) for @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 where @xmath76 can be either @xmath77 or @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ( i.e. , @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) is the normalization constant given by the corresponding initial value at @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 for the time dependent integral scale , @xmath82 being determined by @xcite @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the value of the corresponding spectral energy at @xmath0 . here , for initial equipartition with @xmath86 , it has been assumed that @xmath87 .",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    one of the main results from these considerations is the fact that for @xmath99 both the magnetic and the kinetic spectral energies have a steep spectrum which is proportional to @xmath68 or @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath101 , where @xmath1 is the scale of the corresponding field ( in this context a power - law spectrum with this specific slope is also called a batchelor or von krmn spectrum ) .",
    "this would correspond to a behavior of the form @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the scale dependence of the magnetic and the turbulence fields on large scales , respectively .",
    "for the former this would be in good agreement with the analytical considerations in refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as with the numerical results in ref .",
    "@xcite , which predict the same scaling . for the turbulent field",
    "it is an important result which is also confirmed by simulation as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevolution ] : fairly independent of the initial conditions , even starting off with the total energy being concentrated on only one scale , a @xmath68 slope for the spectral energies forms .",
    "it is important to estimate the scale factor @xmath36 at which the batchelor spectrum can be built up .",
    "to do so , as initial conditions we assume a sharp peak with power - law slopes on both sides of the peak , for both @xmath78 and @xmath77 , i.e. , for @xmath37 we have @xmath104 the exponent @xmath105 determining the width of the peak . assuming furthermore that at @xmath106 for ( [ dt ] ) we have @xmath107 , ( [ dtmqfinalkjk4 ] ) becomes @xmath108 integrating this equation at @xmath109 from @xmath37 ,",
    "when @xmath110 , to @xmath111 , the scale factor at which the final configuration , i.e. , ( [ qslope ] ) , is approximately established , gives @xmath112 using @xmath113 and @xmath114 as stated above , this gives the upper limit @xmath115 a relative full width at half maximum of @xmath116 corresonds to @xmath117 and gives @xmath118 which implies that the @xmath68 slope builds up after a rather short time .",
    "furthermore , the system tends to achieve equipartition quite accurately .",
    "a simple argument for this at large scales can be extracted from ( [ dtmqfinalkjk4 ] ) and ( [ dtuqfinalkjk4 ] ) : assuming that the magnetic and kinetic spectral energies have similar values at @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 as discussed before , we obtain @xmath121 which means that the time evolution of both is the same to the fourth order in @xmath3 .",
    "this is a crucial result since it means that equipartition is indeed possible or at least that at some point , even for the case that @xmath16 and @xmath18 do not have the same magnitude , the time development of both at large scales will qualitatively be the same .      to estimate the magnetic field strength @xmath122 at some scale @xmath123 we use @xmath124 and , with ( [ kint])-([eint ] ) , obtain @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the effective magnetic field for @xmath86 , i.e. , the speed of light , for the initial equipartition of radiation and magnetic energies which would correspond to @xmath127 . if we now acknowledge the integral scale to be the coherence scale of the magnetic field , then for the magnetic field strength at @xmath128 we get , using ( [ kint ] ) and ( [ eint ] ) , @xmath129 and therefore for @xmath67 and @xmath120 it is @xmath130 and hence @xmath131 for the qcd phase transition .",
    "it is hard to imagine how causally generated magnetic fields in the early universe could yield a larger remnant field than quoted above , unless they are generated with substantial helicity .",
    "starting from first principles and reasonable assumptions about homogeneous and isotropic magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence , evolution equations for the spectral magnetic and kinetic energy densities have been derived . after adapting these equations to the use in an expanding universe they were numerically integrated for a number of assumed initial conditions , as possibly resulting during an early magnetogenesis period .",
    "it has been found that , seemingly independent of initial conditions , a @xmath132 tail on scales @xmath133 always develops .",
    "this magnetic field spectrum may therefore be regarded as the natural one for nonhelical cosmic magnetic fields ( cf . also to ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time",
    "most of the energy is concentrated on the integral scale which allows a rather generic prediction of coherence scale and strength of causally created primordial magnetic fields .",
