    "we begin by considering a network made of @xmath0 nodes and characterised by the @xmath1 adjacency matrix @xmath2 : the entry @xmath3 is equal to one if nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) are connected , and it is zero otherwise . if the network is undirected , the matrix @xmath2 is symmetric .",
    "consider then two interacting species and label with @xmath7 their respective concentrations on node @xmath4 .",
    "a general reaction - diffusion system defined on the network takes the form :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the diffusion coefficients of , respectively , species @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; @xmath13 and @xmath14 are nonlinear functions of the concentrations and stand for the reaction terms ; @xmath15 is the network laplacian , where @xmath16 refers to the connectivity of node @xmath4 and @xmath17 is the kronecker s delta .",
    "imagine now that system ( [ eq : reac_dif ] ) admits an homogeneous fixed point , which we label @xmath18 .",
    "this implies @xmath19 .",
    "we also require that the fixed point is stable , namely that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the jacobian of ( [ eq : reac_dif ] ) evaluated at @xmath18 and @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath24 ) denotes the derivatives of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath11 ( resp .",
    "@xmath12 ) , and similarly for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "patterns arise when @xmath18 becomes unstable with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations . to look for instabilities",
    ", one can introduce a small perturbation ( @xmath28 , @xmath28 ) to the fixed point and linearise around it . in doing so",
    ", one obtains eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) ( see methods ) . for regular lattices ,",
    "the fourier transform is usually employed to solve this linear system of equations . when the system is instead defined on a network",
    ", a different procedure needs to be followed @xcite . to this end",
    ", we define the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian operator : @xmath29 when the network is undirected , the laplacian is symmetric .",
    "therefore the eigenvalues @xmath30 are real and the eigenvectors @xmath31 form an orthonormal basis .",
    "this condition needs to be relaxed when dealing with the more general setting of a directed graph , which we will discuss in the next subsection .",
    "the inhomogeneous perturbations @xmath28 and @xmath32 can be expanded as :    @xmath33    the constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on the initial conditions . by inserting the above expressions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : linear ] ) ( see methods ) one obtains the dispersion relation @xmath36 which characterises the response of the system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reac_dif ] ) to external perturbations . here",
    "@xmath37 is the modified jacobian matrix , accounting for diffusion contributions .",
    "this quantity is defined in the methods section .",
    "we use @xmath38 and @xmath39 to label respectively the real and imaginary parts of @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 , the fixed point is unstable and the system exhibits a pattern whose spatial properties are encoded in @xmath30 .",
    "these are the celebrated turing patterns , stable nonhomogeneous spatial motifs , that result from a resonant amplification of an initial perturbation of the homogeneous fixed point .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is the analogue of the wavelength for a spatial pattern in a system defined on a continuous regular lattice . in this case",
    "@xmath42 , where @xmath43 labels the usual spatial fourier frequency .",
    "it can be proved that , for symmetric graphs , @xmath30 is negative .",
    "hence , @xmath44 . for the instability to manifest ,",
    "it is therefore sufficient that @xmath45 , a condition that can be met only if :    @xmath46    when the above quantity is negative , the turing instability on a regular lattice , or on a complex symmetric network , can not take place .",
    "one can further elaborate on the implications of equation ( [ condtur ] ) , by recalling that @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the instability can only set in if @xmath48 and @xmath49 have opposite signs . without losing generality",
    ", we shall hereafter assume @xmath50 , and consequently @xmath51 , with @xmath52 so to have @xmath53 .",
    "in practical terms , the first species , whose concentration reads @xmath11 , acts as an activator , while the second , @xmath12 , is the inhibitor .    working in this setting , it is instructive to consider the limiting condition @xmath54 : only the activators ( @xmath55 ) can diffuse . the necessary condition ( [ condtur ] ) reduces to @xmath56 , which is never satisfied since @xmath51 . in principle , the instability can instead develop if the inhibitors are mobile , @xmath57 , and the activator fixed @xmath58 , but only if the system is defined over a discrete spatial support . )",
    "is positive for @xmath59 .",
    "if the spatial support is discrete , only a finite number of eigenmodes can be destabilised .",
    "the eigenmode associated to the largest eigenvalue @xmath60 guides the instability and the patterns can develop . at variance , in the continuum case the instability involves smaller and smaller spatial scales .",
    "it is therefore not possible to delimit a finite window in @xmath43 for which @xmath61 is found to be positive , and , consequently , the turing instability is prevented to occur . in conclusion ,",
    "a two species system where only one species can migrate , can not undergo a classical turing instability , if the spatial support is assumed continuum . ]",
    "we end this section with an important remark .",
    "since @xmath62 , it is clear from equation ( [ disp_rel ] ) , that it is not possible to satisfy the condition for the instability @xmath63 , and have , at the same time , an imaginary component of the dispersion relation , @xmath39 , different from zero .",
    "this is instead possible when operating in a generalised setting which accommodates for specific long - range couplings in the reaction terms @xcite or when considering at least three mutually interacting species @xcite .",
    "a system unstable for @xmath64 and with the corresponding @xmath65 is said to undergo a wave - instability and the emerging patterns have the form of travelling waves @xcite . as we will discuss in the following , the general scenario that we have outlined here , changes drastically when the reaction - diffusion system operates on a directed graph , rather that on a symmetric network .",
    "we now turn to considering the case of a directed graph . in this case",
    "the adjacency matrix @xmath2 is no longer symmetric and its entries @xmath3 , if equal to one , indicate the presence of an edge directed from node @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "now , @xmath66 refers to the outdegree of node @xmath4 , defined as the number of exiting edges from node @xmath4 .",
    "the associated laplacian operator can be defined as @xmath15 , as it is customarily done in cooperative control applications @xcite , as e.g. intelligent transportation systems , routing of communications and power grid networks .",
    "the spreading of physical or chemical substances , rather than information content , requires imposing mass conservation , which results in a different formulation of the laplacian operator @xcite , where @xmath3 is formally replaced by @xmath67 in the definition of @xmath68 , as it can be readily obtained from a simple microscopic derivation .",
    "clearly , the two operators coincide , when defined on a symmetric network .    for a directed graphs",
    ", the eigenvalues of both laplacian operators , will in general be complex , @xmath69 .",
    "this property requires the development of a generalised theory of the instabilities , extending the analysis outlined in the previous section . as usual",
    ", we will assume a stable homogeneous fixed point , , while no additional hypothesis on the structure of the spatial support are to be made when the operator @xmath15 is assumed to hold . ] and indicate with @xmath22 the associated jacobian matrix .",
    "the stability of the fixed point implies @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in order to proceed with the linear stability analysis",
    ", we must ensure that the eigenvectors are linearly independent .",
    "this is not always the case when the underlying graph is directed .",
    "for this reason , the diagonalisability of the laplacian matrix will be a minimal requirement to satisfy , in our analytical treatment of the stability problem .",
    "introducing an inhomogeneous perturbation ( @xmath72 ) and linearising around it , one eventually obtains a dispersion relation , formally identical to equation ( [ disp_rel ] ) , where now @xmath30 is a complex quantity . for simplicity , and with obvious meaning of the notation",
    ", we write @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , since the laplacian matrix spectrum falls , according to gerschgorin circle theorem @xcite , in the left half of the complex plane .",
    "a simple algebraic manipulation yields the following preliminary relations :    @xmath75 \\label{notation}\\\\ ( \\textrm{det}\\textbf{j}_{\\alpha})_{\\textrm{im } } & = & ( j_{11}d_{\\psi}+j_{22}d_{\\phi})\\lambda^{(\\alpha)}_{\\textrm{im}}+2d_{\\phi}d_{\\psi } \\lambda^{(\\alpha)}_{\\textrm{re } } \\lambda^{(\\alpha)}_{\\textrm{im } } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 select respectively the real and imaginary parts of the quantity in between brackets . to study the dispersion relation ( [ disp_rel ] ) , we shall make use of an elementary property of the square root of a complex number @xmath78 , namely that @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the standard sign function . in light of this consideration",
    ", the dispersion relation can be cast in the form :    @xmath81+\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ ( \\textrm{tr}\\textbf{j}_{\\alpha})_{\\textrm{im } } + \\delta\\right]i , \\label{disp_rel_comp}\\ ] ]    where : @xmath82 and :    @xmath83 ^ 2-\\left[(\\textrm{tr}\\textbf{j}_{\\alpha})_{\\textrm{im } } \\right]^2 - 4(\\textrm{det}\\textbf{j}_{\\alpha})_{\\textrm{re } } , \\nonumber\\\\   b&= & 2 ( \\textrm{tr}\\textbf{j}_{\\alpha})_{\\textrm{re } } ( \\textrm{tr}\\textbf{j}_{\\alpha})_{\\textrm{im } } -4 ( \\textrm{det}\\textbf{j}_{\\alpha})_{\\textrm{im}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the dispersion relation can now contain an imaginary contribution , which bears the signature of the imposed network topology .",
    "travelling waves can in principle materialise for a two species reaction - diffusion model on a directed network , at variance with what happens when the system is defined on a symmetric spatial support . for the instability to occur , @xmath84 must be greater than zero , which is equivalent to setting @xmath85 , as it follows immediately from equation ( [ disp_rel_comp ] ) .",
    "a straightforward , although lengthy , calculation which involves relations ( [ notation ] ) , allows us to rewrite the condition for the instability in the compact form :    @xmath86 ^ 2 \\leq -s_1(\\lambda^{(\\alpha)}_{\\textrm{re } } ) , \\label{instability}\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are polynomials in @xmath89 , of fourth and second degree respectively .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomials are model dependent , as specified in eqs .",
    "( [ c0 ] ) , ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) in the methods .",
    "given the model , one can construct a class of graphs , namely those whose spectral properties match condition ( [ instability ] ) , for which the instability takes place . here",
    "we are particularly interested in models that can not develop the instability when defined on a symmetric , hence undirected , graph . in this case",
    "@xmath90 , by definition , and the generalised condition of instability ( [ instability ] ) can not be met . on the contrary ,",
    "when the graph is made directed , @xmath91 and the examined models can experience a topology - driven instability , as governed by relation ( [ instability ] ) .",
    "recall that we are linearising around a stable fixed point , hence @xmath92 and , in addition , @xmath93 . because of the first inequality , the setting with both @xmath48 and @xmath49 positive is , as expected , ruled out a priori .",
    "consider instead the dual scenario , where both @xmath48 , @xmath49 are taken to be negative .",
    "hence , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are positive , as it can be immediately appreciated by direct inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) in the methods , , @xmath94 , @xmath95 are negative , while @xmath96 , @xmath97 are positive . recalling that @xmath74 , it is straightforward to conclude that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are indeed positive quantities . ] and the instability condition ( [ instability ] ) can not be achieved . in conclusion , and in agreement with the standard theory of pattern formation on a regular symmetric lattice ( network ) , @xmath48 and @xmath49 must have opposite signs , for the instability to develop .    in analogy with the preceding discussion , we assume that the reaction - diffusion scheme is such that @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "we imagine here that the necessary condition ( [ condtur ] ) for the instability to set in , is not satisfied .",
    "no patterns can therefore develop , according to the classical paradigm .",
    "under this assumptions , while @xmath87 is still a positive definite quantity , @xmath88 can take negative values , since @xmath98 . the generalised condition ( [ instability ] ) can then be satisfied and one can expect topology - driven instabilities to develop on directed graphs , as we shall demonstrate in the forthcoming section .    as an additional point",
    ", we wish to emphasise that patterns on a directed network can also emerge when the inhibitors are prevented from diffusing ( @xmath54 , in our notation ) , at odds with the conventional vision .",
    "furthermore , travelling waves are always found for a two species model , the imaginary part of the dispersion relation @xmath99 being at all times different from zero , inside the instability domain .",
    "however , as we will demonstrate in the next section , when @xmath100 , the system evolves towards a stationary inhomogeneous pattern , reminiscent of the turing instability . in conclusion , a two species reaction - diffusion system on a directed graph can display a rich variety of instabilities , beyond the conventional scenario which applies to symmetric , hence undirected , spatial supports .      to challenge the theoretical analysis carried out in the previous section , we here focus on a specific system , the so called brusselator model , a paradigmatic example of autocatalytic reactions .",
    "details of this model are presented in the methods section .",
    "it is worth stressing that the brusselator model has been selected for demonstrative purposes and due to its pedagogical value : the techniques here developed , and the conclusions that we shall reach , are nevertheless general and apply to a wide range of models . as an example , in the appendix we will repeat the same analysis for a version of the fitzhugh - nagumo scheme , that serves as a toy model for inspecting the coupled dynamics of neurons .",
    "we will start by considering the first formulation of the laplacian operator , @xmath15 , which , as previously mentioned , is employed in cooperative control applications @xcite .",
    "to proceed , we should also specify the characteristics of the networks that define the spatial backbone for the explored systems .",
    "two different strategies for generating the graphs will be considered .",
    "on the one side , we will follow the watts - strogatz ( ws ) approach @xcite , modified in order to make the network directed .",
    "we will also implement an alternative generation strategy , the so - called newman - watts ( nw ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "both approaches are described in the methods section .",
    "when @xmath101 is assumed instead , the directed networks are created with the additional prescription to balance the number of incoming and outgoing connections per node .    in the following",
    "we will report the emergence of topology - driven instabilities , defined on directed networks assembled via the two strategies mentioned here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     .",
    "the nodes are ordered as per the original lattice and the reaction parameter values are given in the caption of fig .",

    "<S> the results presented here could impact on the diverse range of disciplines where directed networks are found , such as neuroscience , computer networks and traffic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> self - organised structures can spontaneously emerge from a complex sea of microscopically interacting constituents . </S>",
    "<S> this is a widespread observation in nature , now accepted as a paradigmatic concept in science , with many interdisciplinary applications ranging from biology to physics . </S>",
    "<S> hence , pinpointing key processes that yield macroscopically ordered patterns is a fascinating field of investigation , at the forefront of many exciting developments .    </S>",
    "<S> for example , the turing instability @xcite constitutes a universal paradigm for the spontaneous generation of spatially organised patterns . </S>",
    "<S> it formally applies to a wide category of phenomena , which can be modelled via reaction - diffusion schemes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are mathematical models that describe the coupled evolution of spatially distributed species , driven by microscopic reactions and freely diffusing in the embedding medium . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion can potentially seed the instability by perturbing the homogeneous mean - field state , through an activator - inhibitor mechanism , resulting in the emergence of a patched , spatially inhomogeneous , density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the most astonishing examples are perhaps encountered in the context of morphogenesis , the branch of embryology devoted to investigating the development of patterns and forms in biology @xcite . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> spatial patterns of cortical activation observed with eeg , meg and fmri have been argued to originate from the spontaneous self - organisation of interacting populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons @xcite . in this case , travelling waves can also develop following a symmetry breaking instability of a homogeneous fixed point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the models are usually defined on a regular lattice , which is either continuous or discrete , and the emphasis is placed on the specific form of the nonlinear interactions which are ultimately responsible for the occurrence of the instability .    for a large class of problems , including applications to neuroscience , </S>",
    "<S> the system under scrutiny is instead defined on a complex network , rather than on a regular , spatially extended lattice . in a seminal paper @xcite , nakao and </S>",
    "<S> mikhailov investigated the effects of the embedding graph structure on the emergence of turing patterns in nonlinear diffusive systems , paving the way for novel discoveries in an area of widespread interest . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for the deterministic instability are derived following a linear stability analysis , which requires expanding the perturbation on the complete basis formed by the eigenvectors of the discrete laplacian . </S>",
    "<S> travelling waves can also develop via a completely analogous mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to date , symmetric ( undirected ) networks have been considered in the literature . again , the instability is driven by the non - trivial interplay between the nonlinearities , which are accounted for in the reaction parts , and the diffusion terms . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the space defines the relevant directions for the spreading of the perturbation , but can not impact on the onset of the instability . </S>",
    "<S> consider for instance a reaction - diffusion system defined on a regular lattice and assume that it can not experience a turing - like instability : the system can not be made unstable when placed on top of a symmetric network . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the underlying graph can not destabilise an otherwise stable scheme : the inherent ability of the model to self - organise in space and time is determined by the reaction terms .    in real applications , however , networks are not symmetric or , as they are called , undirected . </S>",
    "<S> it is often the case that a connection between two distinct nodes is associated with a specific direction , which means that the resulting graph is directed . </S>",
    "<S> think for instance of the human mobility flow patterns with their immediate consequences for urban planning , transportation design and epidemic control . </S>",
    "<S> several routes can be crossed in one direction only , so losing the symmetry between pairs of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the internet and the cyberworlds , networks that we explore on a daily basis , are also characterised by an asymmetric routing of the links . </S>",
    "<S> traffic symmetry typically does not hold for network locations beyond intranet and access links @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the map of the neural connection in the brain is also asymmetric , due to the physiology of neurons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in connectome models @xcite , coarse grained maps of the brain , revealed by mri experiments , which reflects this asymmetric arrangement of connections at different scales of resolution .    motivated by this observation , we will show that topology - driven instabilities can develop for reaction - diffusion systems on directed graphs , even when the examined system can not experience a turing - like or wave instability if defined on a regular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this is at odds with the behaviour of symmetric networks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the characteristics of the spatial support that hosts the interacting species play a role of paramount importance , often neglected and under appreciated in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the obvious consequence of our analysis is a paradigmatic shift in the conventional approach to dynamical modelling of any given natural phenomenon </S>",
    "<S> . the dynamical rules of interactions , on which the attention of the modellers has been so far solely devoted , are not the only instigators in the complex interactions that yield the rich variety of self - organised patterns seen in real - world applications . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of the space is also important , and significantly influences the conditions that yield the dynamical instability . </S>",
    "<S> this novel perspective might also hint at the causes that seem to favour an evolutionary selection of network - like structures in the organisation of living matter at different scales . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the excitatory and inhibitory dynamics of neurons , and their specific spatial arrangement are two ingredients that can not be trivially decoupled , the first being probably optimised to serve the global functioning of the brain , given the peculiar structure of the second .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organised as follows . in section  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : results ] we will start by briefly discussing the mathematics of reaction - diffusion on a network , to provide some background for what is to follow . then , we will turn to developing the generalised theory of patterns formation on a directed network . </S>",
    "<S> we will test the adequacy of the theory , for specific reference models , for different choices of the underlying networks and employing two plausible definitions of the laplacian operator . </S>",
    "<S> travelling waves and stationary inhomogeneous patterns will be obtained , by changing the topological characteristic of the graphs , while fixing the parameters to values for which the patterns can not emerge when the model is defined on a symmetric spatial support . in section  [ sec : concl ] </S>",
