    "understanding of the equation of state ( eos ) for dense matter is important to clarify compact astrophysical phenomena . for instance , neutron stars are composed of the core with supra - nuclear densities and crust with subnuclear densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mass and radius of neutron stars are mainly determined by the eos at core . nevertheless , the crust is also important to account for some phenomena such as the pulsar glitches @xcite or the quasi - periodic oscillations in giant flares emitted by highly - magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the range of densities required to investigate neutron stars is enormous .",
    "furthermore , to study supernova explosions , protoneutron stars ( nascent neutron stars from supernovae ) , or binary neutron star mergers , we need an eos with not only a wide - density range but also finite temperatures .    at present , there are a few types of nuclear eoss which has been widely used in astrophysical simulations .",
    "one of the most popular eoss is calculated with the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory for uniform nuclear matter and the thomas - fermi model for nonuniform matter @xcite .",
    "the eos of @xcite , which is based on skyrme - type nuclear interactions and the compressible liquid - drop model , has also been used over the past decade . moreover ,",
    "recently , several eoss based on the rmf model have been opened to the public ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "incidentally , there is an attempt to establish the eos with the cluster variational method for nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , these eoss do not include hyperons . according to terrestrial nuclear experiments such as heavy - ion collisions in j - parc and gsi - fair ,",
    "there are many evidences of existing hyperons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "since the mass differences between hyperons and nucleons are comparable to the nucleon fermi energy in neutron stars , hyperons should be considered in an eos for neutron stars .",
    "these days , thanks to advances in observations , it would become possible astrophysically to get some information on the properties of nuclear matter . in particular , the discovery of a so - called two - solar - mass neutron star ( psr j1614 - 2230 , @xmath2 ) puts a severe constraint on the eos for nuclear matter @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "the inclusion of other degrees of freedom , such as hyperon admixture , meson condensation and quark matter , softens an eos , and the maximum mass of neutron stars is thus reduced ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the mass of j1614 - 2230 can not be accounted for extending the eos of @xcite to a hyperon inclusion @xcite or a hadron - quark phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus , it is urgent to construct an eos which is consistent with both of the terrestrial nuclear experiments and the astrophysical observations .    to solve the `` hyperon puzzle '' , one of us ( t.m . )",
    "introduced the framework based on the hartree - fock calculation in rmf theory @xcite .",
    "an eos becomes stiff due to the exchange ( fock ) term , which is not taken into account in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "they showed that it is possible to make an eos with hyperons which is consistent with the mass of j1614 - 2230 , using the hyperon interaction based on the experimental hyperon potentials @xcite and hyperon - nucleon scattering data @xcite . among the models proposed in @xcite , they recommended the chiral quark - meson coupling ( cqmc ) model which was shown as case ( d ) in table  8 of their paper . in this model , the internal structure of baryons",
    "is considered based on the quark degrees of freedom and the quark - quark hyperfine interactions , and its modification in the nuclear medium is effectively taken into account as a density dependence of an interaction .",
    "hereafter , we denote this model as kms12 .",
    "we extend the eos of kms12 for use in astrophysics . as a first step , in this paper",
    ", we fix the model which is consistent with the experimental data on atomic nuclei . here",
    "we readjust the coupling constants in kms12 so as to reproduce the gross feature of nuclear mass data with the thomas - fermi calculation , as done in @xcite . lately",
    ", finite nuclei are dealt within the framework of rmf model .",
    "nevertheless , the final goal of us is an eos for a wide range of parameters including finite temperatures .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation is applicable for this purpose @xcite , and we adopt it also for the calibration of the coupling constants self - consistently .",
    "moreover , in this paper , we construct the eos for low - density nonuniform matter at zero temperature and apply the result to neutron stars including hyperons .",
    "consequently we can account for a neutron star with @xmath1 , which lies in the @xmath3 limit on the mass of j1614 - 2230 @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ eos ] ,",
    "a brief review of the formalism for the hartree - fock calculation in rmf theory with the cqmc model is presented .",
    "we show the method to determine the coupling constants from the experimental data of atomic nuclei and hypernuclei in section  [ cplcnst ] .",

    "recently , @xcite pointed out that low @xmath84 models , or eoss with @xmath192  mev , would be preferred to account for the observed frequency from sgr 1806 - 20 . note that , the results for @xmath189 are again similar between bbp and this study .",
    "nuclei melt into uniform matter of neutrons and protons in the neutron star core . in this region ,",
    "not only electrons but also muons reside achieving the charge neutrality and @xmath110-equilibrium under weak processes . here",
    "we treat them as non - interacting fermions .",
    "furthermore , hyperons are also generated at higher densities . in figure",
    "[ fig : composition ] , we show the particle fractions , @xmath193 , from the crust region to the core region as functions of the total baryon number density , @xmath194 , where @xmath195 represents the number density of particle @xmath196 . as already stated ,",
    "there are dripped neutrons in the inner crust .",
    "note that , the fraction of nuclei ( @xmath109 ) increases artificially near the transition density to the uniform matter , @xmath187 , because the radius of nuclei , @xmath197 , gets closer to that of wigner - seitz cell , @xmath173 , in equation  ( [ profcrust ] ) . not the spherical nuclei assumed here but the pasta nuclei may reside in this region .    we show the particle fractions of the uniform neutron star matter in figure  [ fig : composition - core ] . in the rhf calculation of this study ,",
    "since the fock contribution enhances the repulsive effect mainly through @xmath22 mesons at supra - nuclear densities , the hyperon creation is suppressed .",
    "therefore the threshold densities of hyperons rise .",
    "in contrast , the creation of @xmath0 is promoted by the inclusion of the tensor coupling with @xmath43 mesons @xcite .",
    "in fact , the critical density of @xmath0 creation in this study is higher than kms12 .",
    "since the value of @xmath198 is fixed and the coupling relation in equation  ( [ eq : su6 ] ) is assumed both in our model and kms12 , the value of @xmath199 is kept . therefore our model has a smaller absolute value of @xmath200 comparing with kms12 ( see also table  [ eosdata ] ) , which is consistent with the difference in the critical density between two models .",
    "note that @xmath13 hyperons do not interact with @xmath43 mesons due to @xmath201 in equation  ( [ eq : lagrangian - interaction ] ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that the @xmath131 hyperons feel a repulsive interaction at high densities and , hence , they can not appear . as a result , among the hyperons taken into account , only @xmath0 appears and the others are not produced below 1.2  @xmath182 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eos ] , we show the eos for neutron star matter from the crust region to the core region .",
    "the pressure is given as @xmath202 in this study , the boundary between the crust and core is determined self - consistently comparing the energy density of nonuniform matter with that of uniform matter .",
    "therefore , our eos continues smoothly from the crust to the core .",
    "in contrast , the previous eos of kms12 adopts bps model @xcite for the outer crust and bbp model @xcite for the inner crust . in the inner crust region ,",
    "the size of nuclei is quite different between our model and bbp model as shown in figure  [ crustzx ] , and it is reflected in eos . on the other hand , in the core region ,",
    "our model is stiffer than the eos of kms12 while they are barely distinguishable in the figure .",
    "this is consistent to the fact that , as shown in table  [ eosdata ] , our eos has large incompressibility @xmath118 than the eos of kms12 . in the higher density region , we can see the softening of eos due to the mixture of @xmath0 hyperons .",
    "note that , our eos satisfies the causality even at high densities because it is based on the relativistic framework .",
    "incidentally eoss constructed by nonrelativistic theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sometimes cause the causality violation , which corresponds to the region above the line of @xmath203 in figure  [ fig : eos ] .    in figure  [",
    "fig : tov ] , the neutron star radii @xmath204 are shown as functions of masses @xmath205 .",
    "the result of kms12 is drawn for comparison , as well as that of the model in which the core eos is the same as our model and bps and bbp models are adopted as the crust eos .",
    "it is known that the inclusion of hyperons generally reduces the maximum mass of neutron stars drastically @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fock contribution prevents the hyperon appearance in our model , and the resultant maximum mass is high as @xmath206 .",
    "this value is within the mass range of recently observed massive neutron star j1614 - 2230 , @xmath2 @xcite . in the @xmath3 limit .",
    "their analysis depends on the model of the companion white dwarf and further investigation is important .",
    "] incidentally , the maximum mass of our model is higher than that of kms12 ( @xmath207 ) for the two reasons .",
    "the first one is because the critical density of @xmath0 creation is higher for our model .",
    "for the second reason , as already stated , our eos is stiffer than the eos of kms12 . in our model , @xmath0 hyperons",
    "are included in the core of neutron stars more massive than @xmath208 , and the maximum - mass neutron star has the baryon number density of 1.01  @xmath182 ( @xmath209  g  @xmath184 in baryon mass density ) at the center .",
    "the mass - radius relation of neutron stars is determined by eos .",
    "we examine the dependence of the maximum mass on the @xmath22-@xmath139 coupling constants , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ hypot ] . as for @xmath150 and @xmath151",
    ", we adopt the values suggested by the esc model , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , in our reference model . here",
    "we investigate the dependence on the coupling ratio @xmath212 , which is defined as the ratio of couplings to esc values , @xmath213 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : tova ] , we show the variation in mass - radius relations of neutron stars with the coupling ratio .",
    "as the coupling ratio increases , the creation densities of @xmath0 become higher and the maximum mass of neutron stars gets larger .",
    "furthermore , for the cases with @xmath214 , hyperons do not appear even in the core of maximum - mass neutron star .",
    "therefore , the maximum mass does not become larger than @xmath215 in our models .",
    "note that , there is no @xmath212 dependence of the low density eos including the crust region .    in our model ,",
    "the radii of neutron stars are around 12 - 13  km for typical values of the neutron star mass .",
    "the difference between our eos and kms12 comes mainly from the core region . on the other hand ,",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : tov ] , the crust eos also affects the radius at about 1% .",
    "when a neutron star radius is observationally determined in high precision , we may be able to study not only the core eos but also the crust eos .",
    "furthermore , as for the crust thickness @xmath216 , the impact of crust eos is comparable with that of core eos . to see this more clearly",
    ", we show @xmath216 as functions of neutron star masses in figure  [ crustthickness ] .",
    "the variation is about 10% among the different eos models .",
    "incidentally , the pulsar glitches are thought to associate with the superfluidity of dripped neutrons in the inner crust and the averaged rate of spin - reversal due to glitches depends on the moment of inertia of superfluid neutrons @xcite . to determine the neutron star structure and composition",
    "precisely , the crust eos is important as well as the core eos .",
    "we have constructed the eos for neutron star matter at zero temperature including nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core . for the eos of uniform nuclear matter , the framework of the cqmc model based on the rmf theory , which was proposed in @xcite , has been adopted . in this study , the @xmath21-@xmath16 , @xmath22-@xmath16 and @xmath43-@xmath16 couplings",
    "have been determined so as to reproduce the gross feature of nuclear mass data with thomas - fermi calculation .",
    "the @xmath21-@xmath139 couplings have been determined to fit the potential depth in symmetric nuclear matter from the recent analyses of hypernuclei and hyperon production reactions .",
    "the @xmath22-@xmath139 and @xmath44-@xmath10 couplings have been taken from the esc model based on the hyperon - nucleon scattering data .",
    "the @xmath43-@xmath139 couplings have been determined through the su(6 ) spin - flavor relations .",
    "the tensor couplings have been determined from scaling of the esc model .",
    "due to the calibration from the mass data , the resultant symmetric energy is consistent with the current implications .    to construct the neutron star eos , we have dealt with not only high - density uniform matter in the core but also low - density nonuniform matter in the crust within the thomas - fermi approximation . in our method , the neutron drip and transition to uniform matter",
    "are described self - consistently .",
    "although all octet baryons are taken into account in the core region , only @xmath0 appears and the other hyperons are not generated below 1.2  @xmath182 .",
    "the resultant maximum mass of neutron stars is @xmath1 , which is consistent with the mass range of recently observed massive neutron star j1614 - 2230 , @xmath2 @xcite . as a future work , we will extend this study to finite temperatures for use in astrophysics .",
