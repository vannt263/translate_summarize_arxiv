    "after more than a decade of study , the fundamental parameters of brown dwarfs remain poorly constrained . unlike hydrogen - burning stars , whose effective temperatures and luminosities are approximately age - independent ( at a fixed mass and composition ) on the main sequence , brown dwarfs cool and dim continuously as they age .",
    "only one of the fundamental sub - stellar parameters , luminosity , can be estimated independently of the others , through the use of trigonometric parallax and empirically determined bolometric corrections .",
    "any attempts to resolve the remaining degeneracies among temperatures , ages , masses , and radii rely on the fortuitous discovery of brown dwarfs in association with stars or clusters of known age . in such cases ,",
    "brown - dwarf ages can be inferred by demonstrating the physical association of the brown dwarfs , usually as common proper motion secondaries or as members of stellar associations , with stars that have known ages .",
    "brown - dwarf masses can be measured from orbital astrometry and radial - velocity monitoring of close ( @xmath7510  au ) binary systems , in which at least one component is sub - stellar .",
    "finally , brown - dwarf radii , and hence , effective temperatures and surface gravities , can be measured in sub - stellar eclipsing binaries .",
    "the union of these three fortuitous cases , eclipsing brown - dwarf binaries associated with stars , offers the best opportunity for empirical determination of sub - stellar parameters",
    ". however , such unusual systems are extremely rare ",
    "the first one , 2massj  053521840546085 , has only recently been reported @xcite . in all other cases involving brown dwarfs ,",
    "the estimation of their properties relies to various degrees on the use of theoretical models of sub - stellar evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , sub - stellar evolution models remain , for the most part , empirically unconfirmed .",
    "partial tests have been carried out for systems other than the ideal eclipsing double - line systems . @xcite and @xcite used astrometric measurements of the multiple system ab  dor a / b / c to test the mass  age ",
    "luminosity relation at the stellar / sub - stellar boundary .",
    "the two analyses offer examples of how sub - stellar evolution models can be tested without considering all degenerate sub - stellar parameters  in this case , excluding effective temperature .",
    "we note , however , that the conclusions of the two teams differ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for further discussion ) , in part because the stellar parameters themselves ( in particular , the stellar ages ) , although used as a reference in either study , may often not be known to the desired or believed level of accuracy . in a separate example ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite tackle the full set of degenerate sub - stellar parameters using high - resolution spectroscopic observations of brown dwarfs in the upper scorpius and taurus associations .",
    "their studies rely on model spectra of brown - dwarf photospheres , constructed independently of sub - stellar evolutionary models , to resolve the mass  effective temperature  luminosity degeneracy .",
    "even though model - dependent , they allow a self - consistent comparison between sub - stellar cooling and photospheric models in the context of empirical data .    in the present paper we take a similar approach and discuss the degeneracies among sub - stellar age , luminosity , and effective temperature ( i.e. , excluding mass ) in the context of models of sub - stellar evolution .",
    "we address these fundamental properties with the help of a new brown dwarf that we discovered as a common proper motion companion to the 130400  myr - old main - sequence g8  v star hd  203030 ( hip  105232 ;  [ sec_observations ] ) . the companion , hd  203030b , has a spectral type of l7.5 , and thus lies very near the transition between l- and t - type sub - stellar photospheres , characterized by the settling of dust and the appearance of methane absorption in the near - ir spectra of brown dwarfs . because dust - settling occurs over a very narrow range of effective temperatures , 15001300  k ( spectral types l6t4 ) , a fact inferred both theoretically @xcite and semi - empirically @xcite , the effective temperature of hd  203030b is expected to be constrained very well . given the known age and luminosity of hd  203030b , we can find its radius and thus offer a constraint on the theory (  [ sec_properties ] ) .",
    "our approach is not fully empirical , because it relies on the semi - empirical results of @xcite and @xcite ; both studies rely on evolution models for the sub - stellar age  mass",
    " radius relations .",
    "however , by adopting the same theoretical evolution models @xcite as in these two studies , our analysis provides a test of the self - consistency of the theoretical models (  [ sec_lt_teff ] ) .",
    "hd  203030b was discovered in the course of a direct imaging ao survey for sub - stellar companions conducted at the palomar 5  m and keck  ii 10  m telescopes .",

    "we briefly describe aspects relevant to hd  203030 .",

    "palao allows diffraction - limited ( 0@xmath009 at @xmath8-band ) imaging in the near - ir with @xmath8-band strehl ratios routinely above 50% for natural guide stars brighter than @xmath9  mag .",

    "we used a 0@xmath097-diameter opaque coronagraphic spot in pharo to occult the primary in deep ( 60  sec ) exposures .",
    "hd  203030 was imaged at palomar on three occasions : 28 august 2002 , 16 july 2003 , and 26 june 2004 ( table  [ tab_observations ] ) . during the first ( discovery ) epoch",
    ", we obtained a total of 24 individual 60-sec exposures of the primary with the coronagraph .",
    "subsequent epoch imaging was shorter ( 612  min ) , as dictated by the necessity to obtain only astrometric follow - up of the already discovered candidate companions .",
    "in addition to the deep coronagraphic exposures , at each of the three epochs we obtained shallow ( 210  sec ) non - coronagraphic @xmath8-band exposures of hd  203030 in a five - point dither pattern , to use as references for photometry and astrometry .",
    "we also took five two - second @xmath11- and @xmath12-band unocculted exposures at first epoch , to measure the colors of the brightest candidate companions .",
    "a 1% neutral density ( nd ) filter was placed in the optical path in pharo during the second and the third imaging epochs to prevent the primary from saturating in the unocculted @xmath8-band exposures .",
    "the short @xmath13 exposures from the first epoch , however , were unattenuated and the primary was saturated .",
    "a final ( fourth ) set of @xmath14 imaging observations was obtained with the keck ii ao system @xcite on 12 july 2005 . on keck",
    "we used the near - ir camera nirc2 ( k.  matthews et al .",
    ", in preparation ) in its 20  mas  pix  scale and with a 1@xmath00-diameter partially transmissive coronagraph .",
    "both ao systems were employed in natural guide star mode , using hd  203030 ( @xmath15  mag ) itself as the guide star , which allowed @xmath8-band strehl ratios around 50% for all observations .",
    "the reduction of the imaging data followed the standard steps of sky - subtraction , flat - fielding , and bad - pixel correction , as described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the individual processed images were median - combined to produce a final high signal to noise image . the final first - epoch image of hd  203030 is shown in figure  [ fig_hd203030_image ] .",
    "a total of seven candidate companions are visible in the pharo fov , only one of which , hd  203030b ( indicated with an arrow near the eastern edge of the image ) , was confirmed as a bona - fide proper - motion companion . the brightest field object ( `` object  1 '' in fig .  [ fig_hd203030_image ] ) was a background star that was visible also in the short exposures and was used to bootstrap the relative photometry and astrometry of hd  203030b .",
    "measurements of the relative position of hd  203030b with respect to that of hd  203030a were obtained at all four imaging epochs .",
    "whenever possible , relative astrometry was obtained from images showing both the primary and the companion : the unocculted palomar images from the first epoch , in which the primary was saturated , and the occulted keck images from the last epoch , during which we used the partially transmissive nirc2 coronagraph . by fitting gaussians to the psfs of hd  203030a ( or to its wings , if saturated ) and of hd  203030b , we could measure each of their positions with 25  mas ( 0.040.10  pix ) precision .",
    "this was not possible for the images taken during the second and third palomar epochs . because we used the pharo nd filter for the short exposures at these epochs , the companion was not visible in the exposures in which the primary was unocculted . and",
    "because the pharo coronagraph is opaque , the primary was obscured in the deep coronagraphic exposures , in which the secondary was visible . in the latter cases we estimated the position of the occulted primary by either : ( 1 ) bootstrapping its position in the coronagraphic images from the position of `` object  1 '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hd203030_image ] ) visible in the shallow exposures taken at the same epoch , or ( 2 ) inferring its position from the peak of the two - dimensional cross - correlation of the central @xmath16  pix section of the coronagraphic image with a copy of itself inverted around its central pixel .",
    "the latter technique takes advantage of the fact that the extended psf halo of the primary is the dominant source of signal in the image , and that the halo is approximately radially symmetric on angular scales larger than the radius of the coronagraph . using either of these two approaches we constrained the position of the primary behind the coronagraph to within 13  mas ( @xmath60.5  pix ) .    at this precision level of astrometry ,",
    "the dominant uncertainty is no longer measurement error , but systematic errors from the astrometric calibration . in particular , accurate knowledge of the focal plane distortion on the detector",
    "is required .",
    "the distortions of the pharo 25  mas  pix  and nirc2 20  mas  pix  cameras were mapped to high precision in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we applied the respective distortion corrections to the measured pixel coordinates , and calibrated the absolute pixel scales and orientations of the two detectors at each epoch from observations of wds  18055 + 0230a binary star with a well - known astrometric orbit from the sixth catalog of orbits of visual binary stars @xcite .",
    "the four epochs of astrometry spanning nearly three years confirmed hd  203030b as a common proper motion companion of hd  203030a . at first epoch ,",

    "moreover , our estimate of the spectral type of hd  203030b does not depend on co and h@xmath37o absorption indices , but on the ch@xmath40 index , which , in the lack of methane absorption , measures the slope of the continuum at 2.2  @xmath38far from any co and h@xmath37o bandheads .",

    "accuracy of the theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "we critically address each of these issues below .    1 .",
    "if hd  203030b was older than the primary , the theoretical estimate of its radius could be sufficiently small ( @xmath250.9  ) to drive its mean effective temperature ( corresponding to its mean age and luminosity ;   [ sec_age ] , [ sec_l ] ) above 1330  k and to make it consistent with the effective temperatures of l / t dwarfs in the field .",
    "however , the physical association of hd  203030b with its primary was already demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt in  [ sec_astrometry ] . while the possibility remains that hd  203030b is an old field brown dwarf captured by a younger hd  203030a , it is highly unlikely .",
    "an overestimate of the apparent brightness of hd  203030b by @xmath410.3  mag would be sufficient to resolve the effective temperature discrepancy .",
    "this remains a possibility , especially given that precise ( @xmath240.1  mag ) ao photometry is notoriously difficult to obtain because of variations in the quality of the ao psf on time - scales of seconds .",
    "our observations on 28 august , 2002 , benefitted from photometric conditions and relatively stable ao performance , with @xmath8-band strehl ratios ranging between 40% and 60% .",
    "furthermore , our choice of wide ( @xmath68  fwhm ) photometric apertures alleviates the effect of variations in the total enclosed power that might be caused by changes in the ao correction .",
    "both of these factors contributed to the high degree of self - consistency of our @xmath8-band ao photometry : @xmath240.05  mag among individual exposures (  [ sec_phot ] ) .",
    "we therefore believe that a systematic error in our photometry is not the culprit for the inferred discrepancy in the effective temperature . +",
    "even though the photometry may be accurate , any of hd  203030a , hd  203030b , or hd  13531a ( the photometric reference ) , could be variable by @xmath410.3  mag at @xmath8 , and thus possibly account for the fact that hd  203030b appears cooler than expected ( because of being under - luminous ) .",
    "indeed , hd  203030a and hd  13531a are both young ( @xmath240.5  gyr ) stars and therefore expected to be variable to some extent . furthermore , variability amplitudes as high as 0.5  mag have been observed in l / t transition dwarfs on time - scales of 0.33  hours @xcite .",
    "however , as already pointed out (  [ sec_phot ] ) , the _ hipparcos _ photometry of hd  13531 shows no variability , hence hd  13531 appears to be an adequate photometric standard .",
    "in addition , our differential photometry between hd  203030b and `` object  1 '' from the individual 60  sec @xmath8-band coronagraphic exposures spanning 1.3  hours on aug 28 2002 does not exhibit deviations larger than 0.1  mag from the mean ( r.m.s .",

    "barring the highly unlikely scenario in which hd  203030b and `` object  1 '' follow photometric variations of similar magnitudes , periods , and phases , we infer that hd  203030b is not strongly variable , and therefore its low effective temperature can not be explained by a period of low intrinsic luminosity .",
    "spectral classification of l dwarfs in the near - ir is still not as well established as in the visible .",
    "optically - typed l dwarfs do not follow a unique and monotonic spectral sequence in the near - ir , indicating that the two wavelength regions probe different photospheric physics @xcite .",

    "a 13% error in the _ hipparcos _ parallax could account for the observed discrepancy in effective temperatures .",
    "we note that this would be of the same relative magnitude and sense as the error in the _ hipparcos _ distance to the pleiades @xcite .",
    "it is possible that such systematic zonal errors of similar magnitude exist also in other parts of the sky ( e.g. , the coma cluster ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the inferred _ hipparcos _ systematic error leading to the pleiades distance problem is of order 1  mas .",
    "this would result in only a @xmath64% error in the parallax ( 24.48  mas ) of hd  203030 : too small to explain the effective temperature discrepancy .",
    "the existence of an unresolved binary companion to hd  203030b , a hypothetical hd  203030``c '' at @xmath254  au from the secondary , would change the inferred bolometric luminosity of the secondary .",

    ", a companion to hd  203030b would have the opposite effect : it would decrease the bolometric luminosities of the individual components ( hd  203030b and `` c '' ) , without much affecting their spectral types , and would thus exacerbate the problem . 7 .   in estimating the absolute @xmath8-band magnitude of hd  203030b we used bolometric corrections from @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the bolometric corrections is limited by the presently small amount of data on l and t dwarfs and by the even smaller body of knowledge of the non - raleigh - jeans ir spectral energy distributions of brown dwarfs at @xmath43  @xmath38 .",
    "only recently has _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectroscopy over 5.538@xmath38 confirmed that the bolometric corrections of @xcite are accurate to within 0.10  mag @xcite , albeit for a small number of l and t dwarfs .",
    "regardless , systematic uncertainties in the @xmath2-band bolometric corrections of l and t dwarfs do not affect our comparison of effective temperatures in relative terms , because both studies that calibrate l and t spectral types vs.  effective temperature @xcite use the same scale of bolometric corrections as adopted by us .",
    "finally , our calculation of the effective temperature for hd  203030b hinges on the accuracy of the sub - stellar evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "without further observational constraints ( e.g. , dynamical mass , surface gravity ) it is not possible to empirically test the accuracy of these theoretical predictions .",
    "however , the radii of the brown dwarfs in the studies of @xcite and @xcite are also estimated based on these models .",
    "our approach in estimating the effective temperature of hd  203030b from its bolometric luminosity and age is therefore fully consistent with the methods employed in these two studies .",
    "having considered and rejected all possible factors that may have lead us to underestimate the effective temperature of hd  203030b ( @xmath5  k ) in comparison to the temperature expected from its l7.5@xmath30.5 spectral type ( @xmath77  k ) , we conclude that hd  203030b is indeed cooler than late - l dwarfs in the field .",
    "we pointed out in  [ sec_discussion_reliability ] that the discrepantly low effective temperature of hd  203030b arises mostly from the larger sub - stellar radius adopted for hd  203030b , because of its younger age but similar luminosity compared to older brown dwarfs of the same spectral type .",
    "having established the robustness of our age and luminosity determinations of hd  203030b (  [ sec_discussion_reliability ] ) , we conclude that either : ( 1 ) the effective temperatures of brown dwarfs across the l / t transition in @xcite and @xcite have been over - estimated on average by 240  k because of unresolved binarity , ( 2 ) the ages of l / t transition dwarfs in the field have been over - estimated , or equivalently , their radii under - estimated ( and hence , their effective temperatures over - predicted ) by theoretical models , or ( 3 ) the range of effective temperatures over which the l / t transition occurs extends to cooler temperatures than found in the empirical studies of @xcite and @xcite , e.g. , due to variations in surface gravity .",
    "we address each of these possibilities in turn below .",
    "the effective temperatures of field brown dwarfs at the l / t transition may have been over - estimated if the majority of these brown dwarfs are unresolved close binaries , i.e. , if they appear over - luminous .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that @xmath2950% of late - l to early - t dwarfs turn out to be binaries when imaged at high angular resolution ( e.g. , with ao , or with _ hst _ ) , including one of the l / t brown dwarfs considered in the studies of @xcite and @xcite , sdss  j042348.57041403.5 .",
    "we test if unresolved binarity is a factor by focusing only on these l / t transition dwarfs that have been imaged at high angular resolution .",
    "seven of the l7l8 dwarfs in @xcite have a priori known multiplicity from _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 @xcite , i.e. , they have either been resolved into binaries , or have remained unresolved .",
    "the mean effective temperature of these is @xmath82  k. it is similar to , if not somewhat higher than , the mean effective temperature , @xmath83  k ( both sets of errors denote standard deviations ) , of the remaining four l7l8 dwarfs that have not been observed at high angular resolution .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that unresolved binarity has lead to a significant over - estimate of the effective temperatures across the l / t transition .    the second hypothesis ( overestimated ages leading to underestimated radii ) is not directly testable with the existing observational data , as the radii of l and t dwarfs have not been measured empirically .",
    "nevertheless , following our discussion in ",
    "[ sec_teff ] , we construct an indirect test , by comparing the effective temperatures of all known l7l8 dwarf companions to stars ( with known ages and distances ) to the effective temperatures of field late - l dwarfs with known trigonometric parallaxes from the studies of @xcite and @xcite given a self - consistent application of the theoretical models @xcite , the two sets of late - l dwarfs , companions vs.  free - floating , should have identical effective temperatures .",
    "the inferred model - dependent effective temperatures of all l7l8 companions to stars ( gj  584c , @xcite ; gj  337c , @xcite ; hd  203030b , this paper ) are all @xmath241345  k , which is @xmath41100  k below the mean for field l7l8 dwarfs with known trigonometric parallaxes (  [ sec_teff ] ; * ? ? ?",

    "equivalently , this translates into a factor of 1.52 over - estimate of the adopted ages for late l dwarfs in the field , according to the models .",
    "indeed , the mean ages of the three l7l8 companions ( ranging between 0.3 and 2.0  gyr ) are a factor of @xmath841.5 smaller than the 2.9 gyr mean statistical age of late - l dwarfs in the field ( @xcite ; also based on models from @xcite ) .",

    "a similar age overestimate is inferred when using the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "that is , the result does not hinge on peculiarities in either set of models .",
    "thus , sub - stellar cooling rates may have been under - predicted , or effective temperatures in the initial conditions may have been over - estimated , in both the arizona and the lyon models .",
    "however , given the strong reliance of this result on the ages of two isolated stars , which are not determined as accurately as the ages of stars in stellar associations , we can not claim to have discovered any inaccuracy in the theoretical models with certainty .",
    "the hypothesis needs to be re - visited once accurate bolometric luminosities are determined for a larger number of sub - stellar objects with well - known ages , e.g. , in open clusters .",
    "the last hypothesis ( that the l / t transition extends to cooler temperatures ) is the default one , as it reconciles previous determinations of the effective temperature at the l / t transition with the present data , without seeking constraints on the underlying physics .",
    "a physical interpretation may nonetheless focus on the role of metallicity and surface gravity in the l / t transition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity of hd  203030b may be assumed to be the same as that of the primary , for which @xcite measure @xmath85}=-0.01 $ ] , i.e. , solar , and likely not very different from that of most field l dwarfs . however , as already discussed (  [ sec_sptype ] ) , the gravity of the @xmath29250  myr - old hd  203030b is expected to be @xmath60.5  dex lower than the gravities of @xmath41  gyr - old field brown dwarfs , as corresponding to its 1015% larger adopted radius . while we determined that gravity has not affected our estimates of the effective temperature and luminosity of hd  203030b in a systematic way , its effect on photospheric chemistry in brown dwarfs is unknown .",
    "we note that , among stars , late - type giants have 200600  k lower effective temperatures than dwarfs of the same spectral type ( c.f .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , a similar trend among sub - stellar objects is not at all unlikely . a dependence on surface gravity in the effective temperature at which the l dwarf sequence merges onto the t dwarf sequence is indeed predicted by the `` unified cloudy model '' of @xcite .",
    "these authors propose such a dependence to explain the observed brightening of early - t dwarfs at @xmath11 band @xcite , arguing that the brighter early - t dwarfs have lower surface gravities because they are younger .",
    "we note that @xcite s theory does not agree with the fact that the young hd  203030b is not brighter than its older late - l counterparts in the field (  [ sec_l ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite have recently demonstrated that the @xmath11-band brightening across the l / t transition is not an age - spread effect , but a real feature of brown dwarf evolution , as might be explained by disruption of condensate clouds at a fixed effective temperature @xcite .",
    "still , with hd  203030b we have now shown that the effective temperatures of different l / t transition objects may not be identical .",
    "it therefore remains an open question whether surface gravity may have a role in setting the effective temperature at the l / t transition .",
    "planned optical and @xmath11-band spectroscopy of hd  203030b , combined with theoretical modeling of gravity - sensitive alkali , metal - hydride , and vo features will attempt to address this issue .",
    "unfortunately , the magnitude of the effect that we will be trying to measure is of order of the accuracy with which of modern models of sub - stellar photospheres can match gravity - sensitive features in brown - dwarf spectra .",
    "the role of gravity on the effective temperatures of l dwarfs at a fixed spectral type may thus be better addressed with younger ( albeit earlier - type ) objects , such as the recently discovered 2massw  j1207334393254b @xcite and 2mass  j014158234633574 @xcite .",
    "we have discovered a proper motion sub - stellar companion to the 130400  myr - old sun - like star hd  203030 .",
    "the companion , hd  203030b , is 11@xmath09 away from the primary , at a projected orbital separation of 487  au . assuming coevality with the primary star , sub - stellar evolution models place the companion mass at @xmath1 . from @xmath2-band ao spectroscopy",
    ", we determine a spectral type of l7.5@xmath30.5 for hd  203030b .",
    "the brown dwarf is thus near the spectroscopic l / t transition , characterized by diminishing amounts of dust in sub - stellar photospheres . because of its association with a main - sequence star of a known age and heliocentric distance , hd  203030b offers a rare chance to probe the l / t transition in a setting in which most of the degeneracies characteristic of sub - stellar models are resolved .",
    "we find that the bolometric luminosity of hd  203030b is comparable to that of @xmath41  gyr - old field dwarfs of similar spectral types , despite the @xmath60.5  dex lower gravity anticipated at the young age of hd  203030b . as a result ,",
    "theoretical models of sub - stellar evolution predict a @xmath6240  k cooler effective temperature for hd  203030b compared to the effective temperatures of its older counterparts in the field .",
    "we consider three hypotheses for the discrepancy : ( 1 ) that the bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures of late - l dwarfs in the field have been over - estimated because of unresolved binarity ; ( 2 ) that the effective temperatures of late - l dwarfs in the field may have been over - estimated ( equivalently , their radii under - estimated ) because theoretical models may have over - predicted their ages ; and ( 3 ) that the spectral type  effective temperature for late - l dwarfs is not age- and gravity - independent . based on multiplicity studies of field brown dwarfs from high - angular resolution observations with _",
    "hst _ and ao , we do not find a significant discrepancy between the effective temperatures ( or luminosities ) of brown dwarfs with known and unknown multiplicities , and rule out the first possibility .",
    "we test the second hypothesis by comparing the effective temperatures of late - l secondaries of main - sequence stars ( with known ages and distances ) to late - l dwarfs in the field .",
    "we find evidence that the late - l companions are @xmath41100  k cooler and @xmath291.5 times younger than their isolated counterparts .",
    "however , because ages of individual stars can not be claimed with such accuracy , the significance of this result is only marginal .",
    "the last hypothesis is a compromise between the discrepant effective temperatures of hd  203030b and late - l dwarfs in the field , and draws a parallel with the dependence of spectral type and effective temperature on surface gravity in stars @xcite .",
    "both remaining hypotheses await testing from larger samples of brown dwarfs with known distances and ages , either as members of known stellar associations or as companions to stars .",
