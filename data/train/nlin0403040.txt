    "this paper expands upon our previous work  @xcite where an outline of the general theory of the bushes of modes  @xcite was presented in connection with the fpu - chain dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , it seems reasonable to recapitulate here some basic notions and ideas .",
    "bushes of modes can be considered as a new type of _ exact _ excitations in _ nonlinear _ systems with discrete symmetries , such as molecules and crystals .",
    "the simplest way for introducing this concept can be described as follows .",
    "let us have an @xmath2-particle hamiltonian system characterized by a symmetry group @xmath3 in its equilibrium state .",
    "let us also assume that this system permits the harmonic approximation and , therefore , we can introduce a complete set of normal modes .",
    "note that every normal mode possesses its own symmetry group @xmath4 which is a subgroup of the group @xmath3 .",
    "let us now excite only one normal mode at the initial instant by imposing the appropriate initial conditions .",
    "we call this mode by the term `` root mode '' .",
    "normal modes are independent of each other in the harmonic approximation .",
    "however , if we take into account some anharmonic terms of the hamiltonian , the excitation will transfer from the root mode to a number of other normal modes with zero amplitudes at the initial instant , so - called `` secondary modes '' .",
    "because of certain _ selection rules _ for the excitation transfer between modes of different symmetry , the number of the secondary modes can often be rather _",
    "small_.    _ definition_. the complete collection of the root mode and all secondary modes , corresponding to it , forms a _ bush of normal modes_. the number of modes in this collection is the _ dimension _ of the given bush .    to avoid any misunderstanding at this point , let us note that one can consider normal modes , determined for a linear system , as a basis for a decomposition of different dynamical regimes in the nonlinear system ( for more details , see below ) .",
    "the energy of the initial excitation turns out to be trapped in the bush simply because of the above definition .",
    "the number of modes in the bush does not change in time while the amplitudes of these modes do change .    for many systems , we can find one - dimensional , two - dimensional , three - dimensional and so on bushes of modes .",
    "note that one - dimensional bushes can be treated as the _ similar nonlinear normal modes _ introduced by rosenberg forty years ago  @xcite .",
    "every bush possesses its own symmetry group @xmath5 which is a _ subgroup _ of the symmetry group of the hamiltonian of the considered system . in the above discussed case ,",
    "when the bush is excited by perturbing the root mode , the symmetry group @xmath5 of the bush coincides with that of this root mode .",
    "the symmetries of all other modes of the bush are _ greater _ than or _",
    "equal _ to its full symmetry @xmath5 .",
    "the development of the above ideas leads to the following important statement of the general theory  @xcite :    _ proposition_. different nonlinear dynamical regimes of a physical system can be classified by subgroups of its symmetry group @xmath3 ( so - called `` parent '' group ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the considered bushes of modes are _ symmetry determined _ objects : the sets of their modes _ do not depend _ on the interparticle interactions in the physical system .",
    "taking into account the specific character of these interactions can only _ reduce _ the dimension of the bush .      in general case",
    ", we must speak about bushes of _ symmetry - adapted _ modes rather than normal modes .",
    "indeed , we consider the symmetry determined bushes whose finding does not need any information about the interactions in the system .",
    "the symmetry - adapted coordinates are the _ basis vectors _ of the _ irreducible representations _ ( irreps ) of the parent symmetry group @xmath3 and they can be found by group - theoretical methods only , without any information about the interactions .",
    "in contrast , the normal coordinates , used for construction of normal modes , must be obtained , generally , by diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix and , therefore , the interparticle interactions must be taken into account .    in the geometrical sense ,",
    "a bush of modes is an _ invariant manifold",
    "_ singled out by its symmetry and decomposed into the basis vectors of the irreducible representations of the appropriate parent symmetry group .",
    "this decomposition plays a very important role in our approach .",
    "indeed , different irreps describe the transformation properties of the dynamical variables corresponding to _ different physical characteristics _ of the considered system . for example , some irreps are active in the infrared or raman experiments , while others are nonactive in optics , but play the essential role in neutronographics , etc .    in this paper , we discuss bushes of _ vibrational _ modes describing the time - dependent displacements of the particles of nonlinear chains from their equilibrium positions . speaking about the symmetry group of a single mode or of the bush as integral object , we mean the specific symmetry of the _ patterns _ of the instantaneous displacements of all particles which correspond to the mode or to the bush . considering the symmetry group of the displacement pattern and the collection of the normal modes contained in a given bush",
    ", we deal with the _ geometrical _ aspect of the bush .",
    "this aspect is independent of the interparticle interactions in the chain .    on the other hand",
    ", we deal with the _ dynamical _ aspect of the bush when consider the differential equations describing the time - dependence of the amplitudes of the bush modes . in this sense ,",
    "the given bush represents a _ reduced _ dynamical system whose dimension is , in general , less ( often , considerably less ! ) than the dimension of the original physical system . obviously , the dynamical aspect of the bush , in contrast to the geometrical aspect , depends essentially on the interparticle interactions .",
    "the modes of the bush are coupled by the so - called `` force interactions '' , while their coupling to all other modes is brought about by `` parametric interactions ''  @xcite .",
    "the latter interactions can lead to a loss of stability of the bush , if the amplitudes of its modes become sufficiently large  @xcite , because of the phenomenon similar to the well - known parametric resonance . in this case",
    ", the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry of the system s vibrational state takes place and , as a consequence , the given bush transforms into a bush of larger dimension .",
    "precisely this mechanism of stability loss by the bushes of the fpu chains is discussed in this paper .",
    "the other mechanisms of the loss of bush stability will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the general concept of bushes of modes for physical systems with discrete symmetry was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "actually , this concept appeared as a generalization of the notion of the complete condensate of primary and secondary order parameters , whose theory was developed in our papers devoted to phase transitions in crystals  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of properties of bushes of modes , the group - theoretical methods for their construction , some theorems about the bush structure can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the bushes of modes for different classes of mechanical systems with point and space symmetry were investigated in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , let us mention the investigation of     all possible `` irreducible bushes '' and symmetry determined similar nonlinear normal modes for the mechanical systems with any of the 230 space groups  @xcite ;     low - dimensional bushes for all point groups of crystallographic symmetry  @xcite ;     bushes of vibrational modes for the fullerene @xmath6 ( `` buckyball '' structure )  @xcite ;     bushes of modes and their stability for the octahedral structure with lennard - jones potential  @xcite .",
    "a review of the group - theoretical methods and the appropriate computer algorithms for treating the condensates of order parameters and bushes of modes can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable computer program ` isotropy ` by stokes and hatch , capable to deal with many group - theoretical methods of crystal physics and , in particular , with bushes of modes , is now available on the internet as free software  @xcite .    in  @xcite , poggi and",
    "ruffo revealed some exact solutions for the fpu-@xmath1 chain dynamics , by analyzing the appropriate dynamical equations , and investigated their stability .",
    "these solutions correspond to certain subsets of normal modes ( so - called `` subsets of i type '' ) `` where energy remains trapped for suitable initial conditions '' .    in  @xcite",
    ", we showed that these subsets are the simplest cases of the bushes of modes for the monoatomic nonlinear chains and that they can be found without taking into account the information about the specific interactions in the fpu-@xmath1 model .",
    "we discussed there the symmetry - determined bushes of modes with respect to the translational group @xmath7 , in detail , and the bushes with respect to the dihedral group @xmath8 , partially .",
    "also , in the paper  @xcite , the stability of the former bushes for the fpu-@xmath0 chain was studied .    in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "bob rink developed a method for finding all possible symmetric invariant manifolds for the monoatomic chains . in spite of the fact that this paper was carried out independently of our approach , based on the concept of bushes of modes , and that it is written in a more rigorous mathematical style , the main idea and the group - theoretical method are very similar to those in our previous papers",
    ". actually , bob rink found all symmetry - determined bushes of modes for the monoatomic chains with respect to the dihedral symmetry group .",
    "moreover , he revealed some bushes for the fpu-@xmath1 chain which are brought about by the additional symmetry of this mechanical system connected with the evenness of its potential ( hereafter we call them `` additional bushes '' ) . however , let us note that the general idea of the classification of the symmetric manifolds ( bushes of modes ) by the _ subgroups _ of the symmetry group of the hamiltonian was not emphasized explicitly in this paper .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on two papers by shinohara  @xcite , devoted to finding `` type i subsets of modes '' ( bushes , in our terminology ) in nonlinear chains with fixed endpoints .",
    "the author does not use any symmetry - related method and prefers to analyze the specific structure of the dynamical equations ( practically , in the manner similar to that of poggi and ruffo in  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , he writes that the `` approach , which relies on the direct analysis of the mode - coupling coefficients , is much simpler '' than the one based on the group - theoretical methods .",
    "in contrast to this opinion , we think that the situation is quite the opposite !",
    "in particular , we have tried to demonstrate in the present paper that the symmetry - related methods are much simpler and much more transparent than those based on investigating the structure of the dynamical equations .",
    "this simplicity becomes especially apparent when one deals with physical objects more complex than monoatomic chains , such as molecules and crystals characterized by nontrivial symmetry groups .",
    "note that comparing our results and those from  @xcite , one must take into account that we use periodic boundary conditions , while shinohara discusses the nonlinear chains with fixed endpoints ( the former boundary conditions are more general , since the latter conditions can be considered as their special case ) .",
    "we would also like to note that the stability problem for the bushes of modes ( invariant manifolds or `` modes subsets of i type '' ) is not considered in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", this problem seems to be important for treating the induction phenomenon discussed in those papers .      in section  2",
    ", we consider a simple crystallographic method for obtaining bushes of modes in the space of atomic displacements which differ from that in our previous paper  @xcite and in the paper  @xcite by bob rink .",
    "a major advantage of this method is its remarkable clarity .",
    "actually , we obtain the invariant manifolds corresponding to the subgroups of the dihedral group and then decompose them into the normal modes of the monoatomic chain . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the discussion of one- and two - dimensional bushes only ( about other bushes see  @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical description of the bushes of normal modes is presented briefly in section  3 .    the general approach to analyzing the parametric stability of the bushes of normal modes",
    "is discussed in section  4 .",
    "5 is devoted to investigation of the stability of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bushes in the fpu-@xmath0 and fpu-@xmath1 chains .",
    "only one 1d bush , b@xmath9 $ ] , can be obtained for the monoatomic chain with an even number of particles$ ] in the paper  @xcite . ] , if the translational group @xmath7 is considered as the appropriate parent group of this mechanical system .",
    "the stability of the bush b@xmath9 $ ] was studied for the fpu-@xmath0 and fpu-@xmath1 chains in the papers  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .-",
    "mode , was also discussed in  @xcite .",
    "] however , we obtain some additional one - dimensional bushes considering the dihedral group @xmath8 as the parent symmetry group  @xcite . moreover , as was already mentioned ,",
    "there exist still more 1d bushes for the fpu-@xmath1 model because of the evenness of its potential  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to compare the regions of stability of all these bushes in both fpu-@xmath0 and fpu-@xmath1 models .",
    "we perform such a comparison in this section .",
    "an exceptional case is represented by the bush b@xmath10 $ ] for the fpu-@xmath0 chain for which the threshold of stability loss is exactly equal to zero ( this result can be proved analytically ) .",
    "we discuss here the stability of 1d bushes not only for the fpu chains with the finite number of particles  ( @xmath2 ) , but for the continuum limit ( @xmath11 ) , as well .    in section  6",
    "we discuss the shape of the stability regions of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) bushes for the fpu-@xmath0 and fpu-@xmath1 chains .",
    "indeed , thresholds of the loss of stability of the 1d bushes depend only on their energy , while the similar thresholds for multi - dimensional bushes depend on the complete set of the initial conditions for the dynamical equations of the bush .",
    "we demonstrate , with the aid of the appropriate plots , how nontrivial the stability regions of the 2d bushes for the fpu chains can be .",
    "the dependence of these regions on the total number of particles in the chains is partially discussed .    in conclusion",
    "7 ) , the obtained results are summarized and some new directions for the bush theory are outlined .",
    "we consider the longitudinal vibrations of @xmath2-particle monoatomic chains with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "let the @xmath2-dimensional vector @xmath12 describe all the displacements , @xmath13 , of the individual particles ( atoms ) from their equilibrium states at the instant @xmath14 . in accordance with the above - mentioned periodic boundary conditions , we demand for arbitrary time @xmath14 : @xmath15    in the equilibrium state , a given chain is invariant under the action of the operator @xmath16 which shifts the chain by the lattice spacing @xmath17 .",
    "this operator generates the translational group @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the identity element and @xmath2 is the order of the cyclic group  @xmath7 .",
    "the operator @xmath16 induces the cyclic permutation of all particles of the chain and , therefore , it acts on the `` configuration vector '' @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21      the complete set of all products @xmath24 of the pure translations @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) with the inversion @xmath22 forms the so - called dihedral group @xmath8 which can be written as a direct sum of two cosets @xmath7 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 the dihedral group is non - abelian group induced by two generators ( @xmath16 and @xmath22 ) with the following generating relations @xmath29    let us consider the geometrical interpretation of the symmetry elements of the dihedral group @xmath8 . for simplification , we will use the reflection @xmath30 in the mirror plane orthogonal to the chain instead of the inversion @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , the actions of @xmath30 and @xmath22 on the vectors of the one - dimensional space are equivalent to each other ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "then we can use the well - known theorem of crystallography : `` any mirror plane and the translation @xmath32 orthogonal to it generate a new mirror plane , parallel to the former plane and displaced away from it by @xmath33 '' .    let the number of particles in the chain ( @xmath2 ) be an _ even _ integer .",

    "remember that two subgroups @xmath112 and @xmath113 of the same group @xmath5 ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) are called conjugate to each other ( @xmath116 ) , if there exists at least one element @xmath117 of the group @xmath5 which transfers @xmath112 into @xmath113 by the transformation @xmath118 it can be easy checked the following conjugations : @xmath119\\sim\\left[\\hat{a}^4,\\hat{a}^2\\hat{i}\\right],\\quad \\left[\\hat{a}^4,\\hat{a}\\hat{i}\\right]\\sim\\left[\\hat{a}^4,\\hat{a}^3\\hat{i}\\right ] .",
