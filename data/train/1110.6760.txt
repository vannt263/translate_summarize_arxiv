    "suspended resonant nano- and micro - electro - mechanical systems ( nems and mems ) find use in versatile applications , such as ultra - sensitive mass detectors , rf filters , and switching devices @xcite . as device miniaturization advances , optimization of the overall characteristics in high - frequency mems / nems resonators becomes increasingly complex and linked with various mechanical , electrical , thermal and optical parameters of the system and its environment .",
    "this compounds their seemingly superior sensitivity to environmental conditions , such as the pressure , temperature and chemical composition of the surrounding gas .    in the characterization of nems and mems under periodic electrical actuation , vibration profile ( vp ) measurements are important in conjunction with frequency - domain spectral studies @xcite . while the latter yield important mechanical properties , the former can be useful in many applications , including optimization of the excitation parameters , aiding the identification of sites most effective for localized functionalization to enable sensing , and in studies of dissipation effects such as intrinsic and pressure - dependent damping @xcite .",
    "space - domain profiling is crucial in the presence of significant nonlinearities where boundary conditions become critical @xcite .",
    "for instance , in typical capacitive electrical drive configuration , the force between the grounded substrate and a device fabricated by patterned suspended poly - crystalline silicon ( polysi ) film ( serving as an electrode ) is inherently nonlinear with the drive amplitude and film stress @xcite .    with interferometric reflection - mode optical transduction @xcite , thermoacoustic effects",
    "can significantly modify the effective device stiffness or induce autoparametric optical drive @xcite .",
    "we observe all these effects to be significant in nems / mems devices defined on films with low compressive residual stress under applied loads near to the euler critical value @xcite . at the critical point ,",
    "mems devices are most sensitive to changes induced by stress variations in chemically - reactive coatings @xcite . of additional practical interest",
    "are possible non - uniformities of mechanical and electrical film properties across the wafer , originating from growth processes and application of anisotropic etch , which directly affect each circumferentially - clamped microresonator ( @xmath0r ) @xcite .",
    "fast space - domain visualization of resonant vps serves as a direct means to study the physics of all these effects on the single device micro - scale during its actuation .",
    "vps in mems are traditionally imaged optically with vibrometric @xcite , interferometric @xcite , or stroboscopic @xcite microscopy . recently ,",
    "spatiotemporal evaluation of resonant vps in high - frequency mems @xmath0rs was demonstrated using resonant realtime synchronous imaging ( rsi ) with a pulsed low duty - cycle nanosecond laser @xcite .",
    "the main feature of stroboscopic imaging is a rapid production of time - resolved interference pattern movies and static profiles , as well as the fast evaluation of vps , thus supplanting scanned motorized probes that are expensive and inherently slow .",
    "this technique is applicable with mechanical resonant frequencies up to @xmath1ghz . in this paper",
    ", we use rsi @xcite in averaging mode to rapidly characterize the vps in bridge @xmath0rs close to critical stress as a function of the drive amplitude and ambient pressure .",
    "the effects of high drive nonlinearity and air damping on the resonator vps are directly monitored .",
    "@xmath0rs are fabricated by standard top - down micromachining methods , where bridges are defined photolithographically on compressively - stressed n+ doped polysi films , deposited by low pressure chemical vapor deposition over a sacrificial oxide layer and wet - etch released . upon release of doubly clamped bridges",
