    "suppose we are given _ two different _ evolution vector fields @xmath5 and @xmath15 over two different rings @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "the question is , how do such homomorphisms interact with extensions ? clearly , unless the map @xmath100 is invertible  and thus an isomorphism  only _ some _ vector fields on @xmath94 can be pushed forward by @xmath100 ; hence , we are in the realm of alternatives ( _ a _ ) and ( _ b _ )  and possibly ( _ d _ )  but not ( _ c _ ) .    now ,",

    "an interesting situation appears when @xmath100-related fields @xmath5 and @xmath15 are extended tangently , by linearization ( see section  2 ) : @xmath106 the general theory [ 13 , 14 ] then guarantees that the extended fields @xmath16 ( [ 4.7 ] ) and @xmath17 ( [ 4.8 ] ) are related by the extended homomorhpisms @xmath107 , acting as @xmath108 ( the general theory also guarantees that the map @xmath109 ( [ 4.9 ] ) is hamiltonian provided the map @xmath97 is .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the duality involution in general destroys extended homomorphisms  unless they are of timid type ( [ 4.5 ] ) .",
    "the tangent point of view , in this sense , is vastly richer than the cotangent one  an inversion of the natural order of physics .",
    "the importance of extended homomorphisms can not be overestimated , for they are the most effective organizing principle in studying and classifying extensions .",
