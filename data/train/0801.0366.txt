    "bars are a very common feature of disc galaxies . in a sample of @xmath0",
    "spirals drawn from the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey , eskridge _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) find that @xmath1 of the galaxies in the near infrared are strongly barred , while an additional @xmath2 are weakly barred .",
    "a large fraction of barred galaxies show two clearly defined spiral arms ( e.g. elmegreen & elmegreen @xcite ) , often departing from the end of the bar at nearly right angles .",
    "this is the case for instance in ngc  1300 , ngc  1365 and ngc  7552 .",
    "deep exposures show that these arms wind around the bar structure and extend to large distances from the centre ( see for instance sandage & bedke @xcite ) .",
    "almost all researchers agree that spiral arms and rings are driven by the gravitational field of the galaxy ( see toomre @xcite and athanassoula @xcite , for reviews ) .",
    "in particular , spirals are believed to be density waves in a disc galaxy ( lindblad @xcite ) .",
    "toomre ( @xcite ) found that the spiral waves propagate towards the principal lindblad resonances of the galaxy , where they damp down , and thus concludes that long - lived spirals need some replenishment .",
    "there are essentially three different possibilities for a spiral wave to be replenished .",
    "first , it can be driven by a companion or satellite galaxy . a direct , relatively slow , and close passage of",
    "another galaxy can form trailing shapes ( e.g. toomre @xcite ; toomre & toomre @xcite ; goldreich & tremaine @xcite , @xcite ; toomre @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they can also be excited by the presence of a bar .",
    "several studies have shown that a rotating bar or oval can drive spirals ( e.g. lindblad @xcite ; toomre @xcite ; sanders & huntley @xcite ; schwarz @xcite , @xcite ; huntley @xcite ) .",
    "the third alternative , proposed by toomre ( @xcite ) , is the swing amplification feedback cycle .",
    "this starts with a leading wave propagating from the centre towards corotation . in doing so",
    ", it unwinds and then winds in the trailing sense , while being very strongly amplified .",
    "this trailing wave will propagate towards the centre , while a further trailing wave is emitted at corotation and propagates outwards , where it is dissipated at the outer lindblad resonance .",
    "the inwards propagating trailing wave , when reaching the centre will reflect into a leading spiral , which will propagate outwards towards corotation , thus closing the feedback cycle .",
    "danby ( @xcite ) argued that orbits in the gravitational potential of a bar play an important role in the formation of arms .",
    "he noted that orbits departing from the vicinity of the equilibrium points located at the ends of the bar describe loci with the shape of spiral arms and can be responsible for the transport of stars from within to outside corotation , and vice versa .",
    "unfortunately , he did not set his work in a rigorous theoretical context , so that it remained purely phenomenological .",
    "he also investigated whether orbits can be responsible for ring - like structures , but in this case , he did not consider orbits departing from the ends of the bar as he previously did when accounting for the spiral arms .",
    "strongly barred galaxies can also show prominent and spectacular rings or partial rings .",
    "the origin of such morphologies has been studied by schwarz ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , who followed the response of a gaseous disc galaxy to a bar perturbation .",
    "he proposed that ring - like patterns are associated to the principal orbital resonances , namely ilr , cr , and olr .",
    "there are different types of outer rings .",
    "buta ( @xcite ) classified them according to the relative orientation of the ring and bar major axes .",
    "if these two axes are perpendicular , the outer ring is classified as @xmath3 .",
    "if the two axes are parallel , the outer ring is classified as @xmath4 .",
    "finally , if both types of rings are present in the galaxy , the outer ring is classified as @xmath5 .    in romero - gmez",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , we propose that rings and spiral arms are the result of the orbital motion driven by the invariant manifolds associated to periodic orbits around unstable equilibrium points . in romero - gmez _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , we fix a barred galaxy potential and we study the dynamics around the unstable equilibrium points .",
    "we give a detailed definition of the invariant manifold associated to a periodic orbit .",
    "for the model considered , the invariant manifolds delineate well the loci of an @xmath6 ring structure . in romero - gmez _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , we construct families of models based on simple , yet realistic , barred galaxy potentials . in each family , we vary one of the free parameters of the potential and keep the remaining fixed . for each model",
    ", we numerically compute the orbital structure associated to the invariant manifolds . in this way",
    ", we are able to study the influence of each model parameter on the global morphologies delineated by the invariant manifolds .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : mod ] , we first present the equations of motion and the galactic models used in the computations . in sect .",
    "[ sec : inv ] , we give a brief description of the dynamics around the unstable equilibrium points . in sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] , we show the different morphologies that result from the computations . in sect . [",
    "sec : dis ] , we compare our results with some observational features and conclude .",
    "we model the potential of a barred galaxy as the superposition of three components , two of them axisymmetric and the third bar - like .",
    "the last component rotates anti - clockwise with angular velocity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a constant pattern speed .",
    "the equations of motion in this potential in a frame rotating with angular speed @xmath9 in vector form are @xmath10 where the terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the coriolis and the centrifugal forces , respectively , and @xmath13 is the position vector .",
    "we define an effective potential @xmath14 then eq . ( [ eq - motvec ] )",
    "becomes @xmath15 and the jacobi constant is @xmath16 which , being constant in time , can be considered as the energy in the rotating frame .",
    "the axisymmetric component consists of the superposition of a disc and a spheroid .",
    "the disc is modelled as a kuzmin - toomre disc ( kuzmin @xcite ; toomre @xcite ) of surface density @xmath17 and the spheroid is modelled using a density distribution of the form @xmath18 : @xmath19 the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 set the scales of the velocities and radii of the disc , respectively , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 determine the concentration and scale - length of the spheroid . in our models ,",
    "we use three bar potentials to compare the results obtained .",
    "the first bar potential is described by a ferrers ( @xcite ) ellipsoid whose density distribution is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 determine the shape of the bar , @xmath26 being the length of the semi - major axis , which is placed along the @xmath28 coordinate axis , and @xmath27 being the length of the semi - minor axis .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 measures the degree of concentration of the bar and @xmath30 represents the bar central density .",
    "we also use two ad - hoc potentials , namely a dehnen s bar type , @xmath31 , ( dehnen @xcite ) and a barbanis - woltjer ( bw ) bar type , @xmath32 , ( barbanis & woltjer @xcite ) : @xmath33{0cm}{1.cm}\\\\ \\displaystyle \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{r}\\right)^n , & r\\ge \\alpha.\\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{1.cm } \\end{array}}\\right .",
    "\\qquad \\phi_2(r,\\theta)=\\hat{\\epsilon}\\sqrt{r}(r_1-r)\\cos(2\\theta ) \\label{eq : adhoc}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath34 is a characteristic length scale of the dehnen s type bar potential , and @xmath35 is a characteristic circular velocity .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 is related to the bar strength .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is a characteristic scale length of the bw bar potential and the parameter @xmath38 is related to the bar strength .",
    "for our calculations we place ourselves in a frame of reference corotating with the bar , and the bar semi - major axis is located along the @xmath28 axis . in this rotating frame",
    "we have five equilibrium lagrangian points ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ myfig1 ] ) .",
    "three of these points are stable , namely @xmath41 , which is placed at the centre of the system , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which are located symmetrically on the @xmath44 axis . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are unstable and are located symmetrically on the @xmath28 axis . the surface @xmath45 ( @xmath46 defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - energy ] ) ) is called the zero velocity surface , and its intersection with the @xmath47 plane gives the zero velocity curve .",
    "all regions in which @xmath48 are forbidden to a star with this energy , and are thus called forbidden regions .",
    "the zero velocity curve also defines two different regions , namely , an exterior region and an interior one that contains the bar .",
    "the interior and exterior regions are connected via the equilibrium points ( see middle panel of fig .  [ myfig1 ] ) . around the equilibrium points there",
    "exist families of periodic orbits , e.g. around the central equilibrium point the well - known @xmath49 family of periodic orbits that is responsible for the bar structure .    the dynamics around the unstable equilibrium points is described in detail in romero - gmez _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , here we give a brief summary . around each unstable equilibrium point there",
    "also exists a family of periodic orbits , known as the family of lyapunov orbits ( lyapunov @xcite ) . for a given energy level ,",
    "two stable and two unstable sets of asymptotic orbits emanate from the periodic orbit , and they are known as the stable and unstable invariant manifolds , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath50 the stable invariant manifold associated to the periodic orbit @xmath51 around the equilibrium point @xmath52 .",
    "this stable invariant manifold is the set of orbits that tends to the periodic orbit asymptotically . in the same way we denote by @xmath53 the unstable invariant manifold associated to the periodic orbit @xmath51 around the equilibrium point @xmath52 .",
    "this unstable invariant manifold is the set of orbits that departs asymptotically from the periodic orbit ( i.e. orbits that tend to the lyapunov orbits when the time tends to minus infinity ) , see right panel of fig .",
    "[ myfig1 ] .",
    "since the invariant manifolds extend well beyond the neighbourhood of the equilibrium points , they can be responsible for global structures .    in romero - gmez",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) , we give a detailed description of the role invariant manifolds play in global structures , in particular , in the transfer of matter .",
    "simply speaking , the transfer of matter is characterised by the presence of homoclinic , heteroclinic , and transit orbits .",
    "homoclinic orbits correspond to asymptotic trajectories , @xmath54 , such that @xmath55 .",
    "thus , a homoclinic orbit departs asymptotically from the unstable lyapunov periodic orbit @xmath51 around @xmath56 and returns asymptotically to it ( see fig .  [",
    "myfig2]a ) .",
    "heteroclinic orbits are asymptotic trajectories , @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 .",
    "thus , a heteroclinic orbit departs asymptotically from the periodic orbit @xmath51 around @xmath56 and asymptotically approaches the corresponding lyapunov periodic orbit with the same energy around the lagrangian point at the opposite end of the bar @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ myfig2]b ) .",
    "there also exist trajectories that spiral out from the region of the unstable periodic orbit , and we refer to them as transit orbits ( see fig .  [ myfig2]c ) .",
    "here we describe the main results obtained when we vary the parameters of the models introduced in sect . [",
    "sec : mod ] . in order to best see the influence of each parameter separately , we make families of models",
    "in which only one of the free parameters is varied , while the others are kept fixed .",
    "our results in romero - gmez _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) show that only the bar pattern speed and the bar strength have an influence on the shape of the invariant manifolds , and thus , on the morphology of the galaxy .",
    "we have also studied the influence of the shape of the rotation curve .",
    "we make models with either rising , flat or falling rotation curve in the outer parts .",
    "our results also show that the morphologies obtained do not depend on the bar potential we use , but on the presence of homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits .",
    "thus , if the model does not have either heteroclinic nor homoclinic orbits and only transit orbits are present , the barred galaxy will present two spiral arms emanating from the ends of the bar .",
    "the outer branches of the unstable invariant manifolds will spiral out from the ends of the bar and they will not return to its vicinity . if the transit orbits associated to the @xmath61 intersect in configuration space with the transit orbits associated to @xmath62 , then they form the characteristic shape of @xmath4 rings . that is , the trajectories outline an outer ring",
    "whose principal axis is parallel to the bar major axis .",
    "if heteroclinic orbits exist , then the ring of the galaxy is classified as @xmath6 .",
    "the inner branches of the invariant manifolds associated to @xmath63 and @xmath64 outline a nearly circular inner ring that encircles the bar .",
    "the outer branches of the same invariant manifolds form an outer ring whose principal axis is perpendicular to the bar major axis .",
    "the last possibility is if only homoclinic orbits exist . in this case , the inner branches of the invariant manifolds for an inner ring , while the outer branches outline both types of outer rings , thus the barred galaxy presents an @xmath5 ring morphology .",
    "the family of lyapunov orbits is unstable and becomes stable only at high energy levels ( skokos _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the invariant manifolds of lyapunov orbits in the range of energies in which they are unstable . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ myfig3 ] , we plot the invariant manifolds for two different energy levels of a given model .",
    "we find that the locus of the invariant manifolds is independent of the energy . as the energy increases ,",
    "however , the size of the lyapunov orbits also increases and thus the size of the invariant manifolds . nevertheless , as we consider more energy levels , we find that the density in the central part is higher ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ myfig3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the thickness of the ring observed is smaller than the thickness of the invariant manifold of higher energies .",
    "we also compute the radial and tangential velocities on the galactic plane and in a non - rotating reference frame along the ring and we observe that they are small perturbations of the circular velocity . the maximum deviation from the typical circular velocity of @xmath65",
    "is @xmath66 ( athanassoula _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    in the case of the spiral arms , we compute the density profile on two different angles , namely one near the beginning of the arm and one at the end .",
    "we find that the first cut has a narrow and high density profile , while the second cut , has a wide and low density profile .",
    "this is the typical behaviour of the grand design spiral arms , namely they are denser and brighter near the bar ends and then they become more diffuse ( athanassoula _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .    to summarise ,",
    "our results show that invariant manifolds describe well the loci of the different types of rings and spiral arms .",
    "they are formed by a bundle of trajectories linked to the unstable regions around the @xmath67 equilibrium points .",
    "the study of the influence of one model parameter on the shape of the invariant manifolds in the outer parts reveals that only the pattern speed and the bar strength affect the galaxy morphology .",
    "the study also shows that the different ring types and spirals are obtained when we vary the model parameters .",
    "we have compared our results with some observational data . regarding the photometry",
    ", the density profiles across radial cuts in rings and spiral arms agree with the ones obtained from observations .",
    "the velocities along the ring also show that these are only a small perturbation of the circular velocity .",
