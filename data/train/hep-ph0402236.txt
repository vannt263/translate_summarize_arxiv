    "the five structure functions are associated with the rate ( @xmath8 ) , single spin effects ( @xmath9 for the muon , @xmath10 for the electron ) and spin - spin correlation effects ( @xmath11,@xmath12 ) .",
    "the complete @xmath0 solution of the @xmath13decay problem consists in calculating all five structure functions at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in differential and integrated form keeping @xmath14 .    in most previous calculations",
    "the strategy of calculating the radiative corrections to the five structure functions was characterized by the statement `` put the electron mass to zero whenever possible '' , keeping the mass dependence only in logarithmic factors involving @xmath15 .",
    "this holds true for the first correct calculation of the unpolarized spectrum function @xmath8 given in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath14 result can be extracted with a little bit of labour from the papers of @xcite .",
    "putting the electron mass to zero ( whenever possible ) is really quite adequate for most of the electron spectrum since the ratio @xmath16 is quite small .",
    "this is no longer true for the threshold region where electron mass effects become important for @xmath17values smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "this will be discussed later on when we calculate the longitudinal polarization of the electron . moreover , after the discovery of the @xmath19lepton it was not so clear to what extent the mass of the final state lepton could be neglected since in the case @xmath20 the mass ratio @xmath21 is not really very small .",
    "historically , the program of calculating the @xmath0 corrections to the five structure functions proceeded in several steps .",
    "here one has to distinguish between results for the differential energy distributions which are characterized by the spectrum functions @xmath22 , and the fully integrated results which are characterized by the rate functions @xmath23 .    concerning the spectrum functions",

    "he used a different route to obtain the integrated rate .",
    "he started with the differential @xmath28-distribution calculated in @xcite and then obtained the total rate by @xmath28integration . because semileptonic heavy quark decays have a structure similar to leptonic @xmath13decays in the standard model his results apply also to leptonic @xmath1decays .",
    "the @xmath14 polarized rate functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 were again obtained by arbuzov @xcite and by us @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is not quite clear what caused the long delay from 1958 to 2003 to complete the missing @xmath0 pieces in leptonic @xmath1decays .",
    "part of the reason is that the necessary calculations are quite involved and therefore had to wait for the advent of modern computers with their symbolic computation facilities",
    ".    for us calculating the complete @xmath14 @xmath0 radiative corrections to @xmath1decay was a natural outgrowth of corresponding @xmath31 polarization calculations that we had done for the semileptonic quark decays @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite which , in the standard model , have a structure similar to leptonic @xmath1decay .",
    "these calculations had been done keeping the full mass dependence of the final state quark .",

    "is given by @xmath93 similar to eq.([matrix - squared - split ] ) it is instructive to split the integral into a transverse contribution @xmath94 and a longitudinal / scalar contribution @xmath95 .",

    "technically , the integration is best done by changing to the variable @xmath102 via @xmath103 in order to get rid of the square root factor in the photon energy @xmath104 .",

    "setting @xmath92 in the total contribution ( [ irintegral ] ) gives the same result in agreement with the arguments presented before .",
    "they then obtain ( using their notation ) @xmath110 it is obvious that the result ( [ sirlin ] ) differs from the true transverse contribution ( [ transverse ] ) .",
    "apparently , behrends , finkelstein and sirlin committed two mistakes in their 1956 paper @xcite .",
    "first , they considered only the transverse contribution of the massive photon instead of including also its longitudinal part .",
    "second , they did not correctly calculate the transverse contribution by erraneously setting @xmath92 in the matrix element .",
    "kinoshita in a recent talk given on the occasion of the 70th birthday of sirlin identifies only the first mistake @xcite .",
    "the two mistakes were corrected in the 1959 paper @xcite of kinoshita and sirlin by adding a compensation term @xmath111 ( their notation ) to their 1956 result , where @xmath112    why so much ado about a mistake done many years ago ?",
    "well , the mistake is in some sense historical since the 1956 result violates the so - called kinoshita  lee ",
    "nauenberg theorem formulated a few years later on @xcite .",
    "the kinoshita ",

    "nauenberg theorem .",
    "the correct result is obtained by setting the square bracket in ( [ 56rate ] ) to zero which shows that the correct result does in fact satisfy the kinoshita ",
    "nauenberg theorem .",
    "in fact , the observation that there is no logarithmic mass dependence in the leptonic @xmath1 decay rate was very likely a progenitor of the celebrated kinoshita  lee  nauenberg theorem .",
    "in this section we concentrate on one interesting aspect of the @xmath1decay problem , namely on the so  called anomalous spin - flip contribution which , even in the chiral limit , flips the helicity of the final  state lepton at nlo .",
    "collinear photon emission from a massless fermion line can flip the helicity of the massless fermion contrary to naive expectation .",
    "this has been discussed in a variety of physical contexts ( see e.g. references in @xcite ) .",
    "this is a `` @xmath114 '' effect where the @xmath115 in the numerator is a spin flip factor and the @xmath115 in the denominator arises from the collinear configuration . in the limit @xmath53 the helicity flip contribution survives whereas it is not seen in massless qed .",
    "we shall discuss this phenomenon in the context of the left ",
    "chiral @xmath116 transition . at the born term level an electron emerging from a weak @xmath117 vertex",
    "is purely left  handed in the limit @xmath118 . naively , one would expect this to be true also at @xmath119 or at any order in @xmath120 because in massless qed photon emission from the electron is helicity conserving .",
    "let us take a closer look at the anomalous helicity flip contribution in leptonic @xmath116 decays by considering the unnormalized density matrix element @xmath121 of the final state electron which is obtained by setting @xmath122 in ( [ diffrate ] ) ( remember that @xmath50 vanishes for @xmath53 , and @xmath123 in the standard model ) .",
    "one has      contrary to naive expectations one finds non  vanishing right  handed @xmath125 contributions which survive the @xmath53 limit when one takes the @xmath53 limit of the nlo contributions to ( [ plusplus1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , one finds      the result is rather simple .",
    "in particular , it does not contain any logarithms or dilogarithms .",
    "the simplicity of the right  handed contribution becomes manifest in the equivalent particle description of @xmath127decay where , in the peaking approximation , @xmath127decay is described by the two  stage process @xmath128 followed by the branching process @xmath129 characterized by universal splitting functions @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "the symbols @xmath131 and @xmath132 stand for a helicity non - flip and helicity flip of the helicity of the electron . in the splitting process @xmath133 is the fractional energy of the emitted photon .",
    "the off  shell electron in the propagator is replaced by an equivalent on  shell electron in the intermediate state .",
    "since the helicity flip contribution arises entirely from the collinear configuration it can be calculated in its entirety using the equivalent particle description .",
    "the helicity flip splitting function is given by @xmath134 , where @xmath135 , and where @xmath136 is the energy of the emitted photon .",
    "@xmath137 and @xmath138 denote the energies of the initial and final electron in the splitting process .",
    "the helicity flip splitting function has to be folded with the appropriate @xmath118 born term contribution .",
    "the lower limit of the folding integration is determined by the soft photon point where @xmath139 .",
    "the upper limit is determined by the maximal energy of the initial electron @xmath140 .",
    "one obtains    @xmath141 & = &     \\frac{\\alpha}{2 \\pi }     \\int_x^1 dx ' \\frac{1}{x ' }     \\frac{d \\gamma^{{\\mathrm { born } } } ( x ' ) }      { dx ' }      ( 1 - \\frac{x}{x ' } ) \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] & = &     \\frac{\\alpha } { \\pi } \\gamma_0     \\int_x^1 dx ' ( x ' - x )     \\big ( 3 - 2 x ' \\big ) \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] & = &     \\frac{\\alpha}{6 \\pi } \\gamma_0     \\big ( ( 1 - x)^2 ( 5 - 2 x ) \\big ) \\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath144function expresses energy conservation in the splitting process .",
    "the integration over @xmath83 shifts the lower boundary of the @xmath145 integration from 0 to @xmath146 because of the @xmath144function .",
    "the final result exactly reproduces the result ( [ plusplus2 ] ) .",
    "numerically , the flip spectrum function is rather small compared to the @xmath119 no - flip spectrum function .",
    "however , when averaging over the spectrum the ratio of the @xmath119 flip and no - flip contributions amounts to a non - negligible @xmath147 , due to cancellation effects in the @xmath119 no - flip contribution .",
