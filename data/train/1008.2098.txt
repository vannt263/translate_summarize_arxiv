    "it often occurs that a physical problem can be treated by means of rather different mathematical approaches .",
    "problem of pair creation from vacuum by electric field was first considered on the basis of the first quantized relativistic theory in the context of the klein paradox , i.e. scattering at electrical potential barrier @xcite .",
    "later on , this problem was studied in the framework of quantum field theory by the effective action technique @xcite , by explicit construction of @xmath0-matrix in the non - stationary gauge @xcite and by semiclassical methods @xcite , see also the monographes @xcite for review of these and some other approaches .",
    "more recently , there appeared yet another approach to pair creation effect in external field @xcite , which is based on equations that bear strong resemblance to kinetic equations widely used in plasma physics and other non - equilibrium problems .",
    "following the authors of these papers , let us call it the quantum kinetic equation ( qke ) approach .",
    "the obvious benefits of the qkes are simple implementation of numeric calculations @xcite and ability of natural inclusion of account for back reaction to the external field @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are also several disadvantages , including ( at least , currently ) restriction to homogeneous fields only and seemingly non - gauge invariant form , non - ability of finding exact analytical solutions even for the problems that knowingly admit such solutions , and , as we are demonstrating in this paper , delusive physical interpretation of the basic quantities involved in qke .",
    "obviously , synthesis of different approaches may be very helpful for further development of the theory .",
    "the qkes had been rigourously derived from the first principles of qed for a specific case of homogeneous time - variable electric field for creation of both scalar @xcite and fermion @xcite pairs .",
    "therefore , this approach must be manifestly equivalent to other exact methods mentioned above . surprisingly , to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no attempts were made in the literature to establish this equivalence explicitly until the recent paper @xcite .",
    "moreover , let us mention the attempts to contrast the results obtained by qke to those obtained by more traditional approaches @xcite with finding difference among them , and to derive the different source term for qke starting from the @xmath0-matrix approach @xcite .",
    "as for the paper @xcite , though it have stated for the first time the aforementioned equivalence , explicit correspondence was provided only for scalar pair production and , in addition , in the form which is not best suited for practical purposes ( e.g. , for testing the numerical routines with the exact solutions ) .    in order to simplify the qke ,",
    "several ad hoc approximations had been suggested , such as , e.g. , the markovian and the low - density approximation @xcite .",
    "however , expectations that these approximations can be justified under some conditions are based on the analogies with the properties of more usual kinetic equations .",
    "an important point here is that the function satisfying the qke does not actually possess the meaning of particle distribution as long as particle creation process goes on .",
    "rather , this function accounts for a `` quantum soup '' of real particles and vacuum fluctuations .",
    "these ingredients can not be separated in principle owing to the uncertainty relations .    in the present paper , after a brief review of the qke approach in the section [ sec:1 ] , we provide the explicit bilinear ansatz that converts qke to the ( dimensionally reduced ) klein - gordon or dirac ( sec .  [ sec:2 ] ) equation .",
    "our ansatz allows to adopt the known exact analytical solutions of the pair creation problem in the qke context . in particular , we illustrate our correspondence in more details for the paradigmatic case of constant electric field . in the sec .",

    "the plots @xmath18 obtained by direct numerical integration of qke can be found on figs .  2 and 3 of the ref .",
    "it is clear from the figures , that the curves are starting from zero at @xmath21 in accordance with our initial conditions and are tending to some asymptotic values at @xmath78 .",
    "these asymptotic values are @xmath79 ( for both scalars and fermions ) and @xmath80 ( for bosons and fermions , respectively ) and agree with the results obtained by other , e.g. , @xmath0-matrix , methods .",
    "however , this transition is not monotonous but is accompanied with oscillations in some transient region of width @xmath81 around @xmath82 , which in fact essentially coincides to the commonly accepted `` coherence length '' ( or formation time ) @xcite for a pair production process .",
    "both estimations are compatible with our calculations .",
    "for the purposes of the present paper , this difference is not important . ] .",
    "it can be also observed from the figures that the magnitude of oscillations is relatively much larger ( compared to the corresponding asymptotic values ) in the case of large values of @xmath83 , i.e. for subcritical pair production .",
    "these oscillations can not be attributed to instant increase in particle production itself , because the notion of particles and antiparticles can not be defined rigorously in the transient region .",
    "this must be clear already from the @xmath84 commutation relation @xmath85=\\frac{\\dot\\omega}{\\omega}\\left(v - v^\\dagger\\right)\\ ] ] which follows from the eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", we have the uncertainty relation @xmath86 similar uncertainty relation can be derived for fermions . in virtue of ( [ ur ] )",
    ", oscillations in the transient region are accompanied with quantum fluctuations . similarly to @xmath49 , the quantity @xmath87 on the rhs also oscillates with frequency @xmath88 .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 characterizes simultaneously the real particles and the vacuum perturbations and there is no way to extract information relevant for the particles alone .",
    "hence , it is rather more accurate to use the term `` quasiparticles '' instead of `` particles '' in this context . only outside the transient region , where @xmath89 varies slowly",
    ", quasiparticles turn into the real particles .",
    "this means that , in contradiction with the claims of some other authors , particle creation process can not be resolved on the temporal and spatial scales of the coherence length .",
    "we ll come back and give more comments on this peculiarity in the sequel .",
    "the total number of pairs created in a unit volume during the time period @xmath90 can be obtained as usually by summing over all the excited modes of the field . for scalar field , this quantity can be computed as @xmath91 where we have taken into account that only particles with @xmath92 are being created in the time interval under consideration . for fermion case ,",
    "the pair production yield is twice larger due to additional summation over the spin index of the modes .",
    "these results are well known , of course , and had been obtained previously by other methods , though in some modern papers the pair production yield is sometimes incorrectly identified with the doubled imaginary part of the heisenberg - euler - schwinger effective action .",
    "the latter is related in fact to the vacuum - vacuum transition probability and has no exact relation to the pair production yield .",
    "the qkes ( [ qke_osc ] ) , ( [ qke_ferm ] ) look very complicated , in particular they possess non - marcovian character .",
    "the latter means that the rhs of the qke depends on the history .",
    "of course , this dependence arises just for elimination of the equations ( [ da ] ) , ( [ da_ferm ] ) , so that the problem admits an equivalent formulation in local terms .",
    "nevertheless , it may be useful in some problems to deal with qke on its own footing , without reference to differential equations that lie in its origin .",
    "several attempts were made in order to simplify the qke , including the markovian ( taking the factor @xmath93 outside the sign of the integral over @xmath94 ) and the low - density ( neglecting @xmath49 on the rhs ) approximations @xcite .",
    "intuitively , they would be reasonable if @xmath49 was large and monotonously increasing , or essentially small , respectively .    however , the occupation numbers are actually not large and , besides , the oscillatory behavior discussed in the preceding section generally contradicts both assumptions . in practice ,",
    "it was shown by direct numerical integration in the papers cited above , that the markovian approximation does not provide good accuracy ( though , of course , gives the correct order ) in the whole range of the field strength , whereas it is believed that the low - density approximation works good for weak fields . in this section ,",
    "we evaluate the total pair production rate within the low - density approximation analytically for weak constant field and explicitly estimate its accuracy .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us illustrate the line of computations using the eq .",
    "( [ qke_osc ] ) and later come back to the fermion case . within the low - density approximation ,",

    "we attribute this discrepancy to contribution of oscillations in the course of pair creation that have been discussed previously .",
    "we have demonstrated that the quantum kinetic equation ( qke ) approach to pair production problem is equivalent to the known for a long time @xmath0-matrix approach by establishing explicit correspondence between them for both scalar and fermion fields .",
    "this equivalence has been already declared recently @xcite , though not proved for the fermion case . as an illustration",
    ", we have applied our correspondence to obtain the exact solution for both scalar and fermion qkes in the constant field .",
    "of course , exact analytical solutions for qkes can be now constructed for other situations that are known to be exactly solvable by conventional methods , e.g. for @xmath114 .    at the same time , any attempt to perturb the kqes by applying some kind of approximation procedures ( e.g. , by imposing the markovian , or the low - density approximations ) inevitably destruct the correspondence .",
    "we have demonstrated it on the example of the low - density approximation which was believed to be well justified in the weak field limit . in contradiction with these expectations ,",
    "we have proved that for the case of constant field its accuracy all the same tends to @xmath115 even under the optimal conditions .",
    "it could seem that , being equivalent to the conventional approaches and looking more complicated , the qkes are useless for pair creation problems with the possible exception of arranging the algorithms for numerical computations .",
    "this is not the case , however , since the qke approach admits simple incorporation of backreaction on the external field @xcite .",
    "in addition , the form of the kinetic equation is very pleasant in principle for incorporation of the secondary processes in the resulting electron - positron plasma @xcite , such as annihilation , hard photon emission , compton scattering , etc . by simple inclusion of the appropriate collision terms on the rhs .    at the same time , in our opinion , at the present stage of development of qke approach the latter attempts are too hasty , at least in the high - intensity laser problems .",
    "the first reason is that the spatial and temporal scales of variation of the laser field are of the same order , so that spatial variation of the field should be taken into account as well .",
    "up to now , this has never been done starting from the first principles of qed , though some phenomenological conjectures had been given .",
    "the second reason is delusive physical interpretation of the occupation number participating qkes at the time scales of the order of the formation time of pair creation process .",
    "as we have shown in the paper , the situation here is quite similar to the attempts to resolve the trajectory of a particle with the accuracy exceeding the limits imposed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "we believe that the true kinetic equations for pair creation , which can be treated by the commonly accepted methods , must contain some sort of averaging over the fine scale of formation for the pair creation process .",
