    "early investigations of black hole accretion flows indicated that tenuous flows can develop a two - temperature structure , with proton temperature sufficient to produce a significant @xmath0-ray luminosity above 10 mev through @xmath9 production ( e.g.  dahlbacka , chapline & weaver 1974 ) .",
    "the two - temperature structure is an essential feature of the optically - thin , advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) model , which has been extensively studied and successfully applied to a variety of black hole systems ( see , e.g. , reviews in yuan 2007 , narayan & mcclintock 2008 , yuan & narayan 2013 ) over the past two decades , following the work of narayan & yi ( 1994 ) .",
    "mahadevan , narayan & krolik ( 1997 ; hereafter m97 ) pointed out that @xmath0-ray emission resulting from proton - proton collisions in adafs may be a signature allowing to test their fundamental nature .",
    "the model of m97 relied on a non - relativistic adaf model and their computations were improved by oka & manmoto ( 2003 ; hereafter om03 ) who used a fully general relativistic ( gr ) model of the flow . however , both m97 and om03 neglected the doppler and gravitational shifts of energy as well as gravitational focusing and capturing by the black hole , which is a major deficiency because the @xmath0-ray emission is produced very close to the black hole s horizon . furthermore",
    ", both works neglected the internal absorption of @xmath0-ray photons to pair creation , which effect should be important in more luminous systems .",
    "adafs are supposed to power low - luminosity agns , like fanaroff - riley type i ( fr i ) radio galaxies or low - luminosity seyfert galaxies , and a measurement , or even upper limits on their @xmath0-ray emission , may put interesting constraints on the properties of the source of high - energy radiation in such objects .",
    "m97 and om03 considered only the _",
    "cgro_/egret source in the direction of the galactic center for such an analysis .",
    "significant progress in exploration of the @xmath0-ray activity of agns which has been made after their works , thanks to the _ fermi _ mission , motivates us to develop a more accurate model of the hadronic @xmath0-ray emission from adafs .",
    "detections of @xmath0-ray emission from objects with misaligned jets ( e.g.  abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) are most relevant for our study .",
    "their @xmath0-ray radiation is usually explained as a jet emission ; we show that emission from an accretion flow may be a reasonable alternative , at least in some fr is .",
    "we focus on modelling of radiation in 100 mev  10 gev energy range , relevant for the _ fermi_-lat measurements of the fr i radio galaxies ( abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) and over which the upper limits in seyfert galaxies are derived ( ackermann et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0-ray luminosity on the black hole spin parameter makes a particularly interesting context for such an investigation .",
    "already a rough estimate by shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 ) indicated a strong dependence of the @xmath0-ray luminosity from a two - temperature flow on the spin of the black hole and , then , they suggested that this effect may serve as a means to measure the spin value ( see also eilek & kafatos 1983 and colpi , maraschi & treves 1986 ) .",
    "om03 , who made gr calculations for the modern adaf model , found a dramatic dependence of the @xmath0-ray luminosity on the spin value in models with thermal distribution of proton energies , however , they concluded that the dependence is weak if protons have a nonthermal distribution . in this work",
    "we extend the analysis of this issue and clarify some related properties .",
    "we find global solutions of the hydrodynamical adaf model , which follows manmoto ( 2000 ) , and use them to compute the @xmath0-ray emission . similarly to m97 and om03 we take into account emission resulting from thermal and nonthermal distribution of proton energies ; we use similar phenomenological models , with some modifications which allow to illustrate separately effects due to local distribution of proton energies and to radial profile of @xmath0-ray emissivity .",
    "we also use our recently developed model of global comptonization ( niedwiecki , xie & zdziarski 2012 ; hereafter n12 , see also xie et al .",
    "2010 ) to compute the x - ray emission , which allows to investigate the internal absorption of @xmath0-ray photons to pair creation in the flow .    in our computations",
    "we assume a rather weak magnetic field , with the magnetic pressure of 1/10th of the total pressure , supported by results of the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations in which amplification of magnetic fields by the magneto - rotational instability typically saturates at such a ratio of the magnetic to the total pressure ( e.g.  machida , nakamura & matsumoto 2004 , hirose et al .",
    "2004 , hawley & krolik 2001 ) .",
    "we investigate the dependence on the poorly understood parameter in adaf theory , @xmath10 , describing the fraction of the turbulent dissipation that directly heats electrons in the flow .",
    "we take into account only one value of the accretion rate , but the considered ranges of the spin and @xmath10 parameters yield a rather large range of bolometric luminosities of @xmath11 to @xmath12 of the eddington luminosity . in our paper",
    "we present both the spectra affected by @xmath13 absorption and those neglecting the absorption effect ; the latter may be easily scaled to smaller accretion rates , for which the @xmath13 absorption becomes unimportant .",
    "we consider a black hole , characterised by its mass , @xmath14 , and angular momentum , @xmath15 , surrounded by a geometrically thick accretion flow with an accretion rate , @xmath16 .",
    "we define the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the gravitational radius and @xmath22 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "most results presented in this work correspond to @xmath23 , in fig [ fig:6]a we present also results for @xmath24 .",
    "we consider @xmath25 and three values of the spin parameter , @xmath26 , 0.95 and 0.998 .",
    "the inclination angle of the line of sight to the symmetry axis is given by @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the density distribution is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the scale height at @xmath30 .",
    "we assume the viscosity parameter of @xmath31 and the ratio of the gas pressure ( electron and ion ) to the total pressure of @xmath32 .",
    "the fraction of the dissipated energy which heats directly electrons is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "our calculations of hadronic processes are based on global solutions of the fully gr hydrodynamical model of two - temperature adafs , described in n12 , which follows closely the model of manmoto ( 2000 ) . here",
    "we recall only the ion energy equation , which is most important for the present study : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the coulomb rate , the compressive heating and the advection of the internal energy of ions , respectively , are given by @xmath35 and the viscous dissipation rate , per unit area , is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the ion pressure , @xmath39 is the electron pressure , @xmath40 is the ion adiabatic index , @xmath41 is the angular velocity of the flow , @xmath42 is the lorentz factor of the azimuthal motion and @xmath43 .",
    "the form of the energy equation given in equation ( [ eq : ions ] ) is standard in adafs theory , although actually it should include an additional term describing the direct cooling of protons to pion production , @xmath44 . in our calculation of hadronic processes",
    "we find that @xmath44 is approximately equal to @xmath34 at @xmath45 . at @xmath46 ,",
    "considered in this work , both @xmath44 and @xmath34 are much smaller , by over 3 orders of magnitude , than the effective heating @xmath47 and the heating is fully balanced by the advective term , @xmath48 .",
    "this justifies our neglect of the direct hadronic cooling .",
    "the only difference between our gr model and that of manmoto ( 2000 ) involves the simplifying assumption of @xmath49 adopted in the latter ; we do not follow this simplification and an exact @xmath50 profile is considered in all our hydrodynamic equations .",
    "we note that the simplification has a considerable effect in the central part of the flow , e.g.  it results in an underestimation of the proton temperature by a factor of @xmath51 within the innermost @xmath52 .",
    "applying the above simplifying assumption we get exactly the same flow parameters as manmoto ( 2000 ) ; note , however , that manmoto ( 2000 ) assumed an equipartition between the gas and plasma pressures , with @xmath53 , which in general gives a smaller proton temperature than @xmath54 assumed here . in particular , for @xmath26 and @xmath55 , models with @xmath54 give the proton temperature larger by a factor of @xmath56 , close to the horizon , than models with @xmath53 .",
    "this underlies also the differences in the @xmath0-ray luminosity levels between the thermal models of oka & manmoto ( 2003 ) and ours , as discussed in section 3 .    to obtain global transonic solutions we have to adjust the specific angular momentum per unit mass accreted by the black hole , for which the accretion flow passes smoothly through the sonic point , @xmath57 .",
    "we note that this condition permits for two kinds of solutions , below referred to as a standard and a superhot solution .",
    "the latter ( superhot ) has much larger proton temperature and density , furthermore , the sound speed is large and the sonic point located in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon , e.g.  @xmath58 for @xmath59 . in the standard solutions the sonic point",
    "is located at larger distances , @xmath60 .",
    "taking into account rather extreme properties of the superhot solutions ( specifically , a very large magnitude of @xmath61 illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and discussed in section [ sec : diss ] ) we neglect them in this work and for all values of @xmath8 we consider only the standard solutions which are consistent with solutions of the model investigated in several previous studies ( e.g.  manmoto 2000 , yuan et al  2009 , li et al .",
    "note , however , that in our previous works ( n12 , niedwiecki , xie & beckmann 2012 ) we considered the superhot solution with @xmath59 , then , the results for @xmath59 discussed in those works correspond to flows with larger proton temperature and density ( both by a factor of @xmath62 ) than these considered in the present study .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the dependence on the black hole spin of some parameters from our solutions which are crucial for the hadronic @xmath0-ray production .",
    "rotation of the black hole stabilizes the circular motion of the flow which yields a higher density ( through the continuity equation ) .",
    "furthermore , the stabilized rotation of the flow results in a stronger dissipative heating giving a larger proton temperature for larger @xmath8 .",
    "all these differences are significant only within the innermost @xmath63 .",
    "the hydrodynamical solutions set the proton density , @xmath64 , and temperature , @xmath65 , as a function of radius . in principle , this should allow to determine the @xmath0-ray emissivity , resulting from neutral pion production in proton - proton collisions and their subsequent decay into @xmath0-ray photons , in the rest frame of the flow .",
    "however , details of this process are subject to an uncertainty related to the distribution of proton energies , which is unlikely to be thermal in optically thin flows ( see discussion in section [ sec : protons ] ) . following m97 and om03",
    "we assume that the temperature from the global solution functions as a parameter specifying the average energy of protons in the plasma which , however , does not have to have a thermal distribution .",
    "we consider several phenomenological models which must satisfy the obvious requirements that at each radius ( 1 ) the number density of protons equals @xmath66 , determined by the global adaf solution and ( 2 ) the average energy of protons equals the average energy @xmath67 of the maxwellian proton gas with temperature , @xmath68 , determined by the global adaf solution , where @xmath69 and we use the simplified ( cf .",
    "gammie & popham 1998 ) relativistic form of @xmath70 .",
    "we consider models involving various combinations of thermal @xmath71 ,   \\label{eq : thdist}\\ ] ] and power - law @xmath72 distributions of proton energies , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the local densities of these two populations . the thermal model ( model t ) assuming a purely maxwellian distribution of protons and the nonthermal model ( model n , same to nonthermal models of m97 and om03 ) , assuming that the total energy is stored in the power - law distribution of a small fraction of protons , allow us to estimate the _ minimum _ and _ maximum _ level of @xmath0-ray luminosity , respectively , for a given set of ( @xmath14 , @xmath75 , @xmath8 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "mahadevan ( 1999 ) and om03 considered the model involving the mixture of the thermal and power - law distributions , with the radius - independent parameter characterizing the fraction of energy that goes into the two distributions .",
    "deviations of such a model from model n are trivial , with the @xmath0-ray luminosity linearly proportional to the fraction of energy going to the power - law distribution . in this work",
    "we consider a different hybrid model ( model h ) with the radius dependent normalization between the power - law and the thermal distribution , which allows us to illustrate some additional effects .",
    "the detailed assumptions on the parameters of these models are as follows ( @xmath66 and @xmath68 denote values given by the global adaf solution ) :    * model t * assumes a purely maxwellian distribution of protons , equation ( [ eq : thdist ] ) , with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "* assumes that a fraction @xmath80 of protons form the power - law distribution , equation ( [ eq : pldist ] ) , with the radius - independent index @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the remaining protons are cold , with the lorentz factor @xmath83 ( @xmath84 is assumed in the computations ) .",
    "the radius - dependent fraction @xmath80 is determined by @xmath85 .",
    "\\label{psi1}\\ ] ]    * model h * assumes that an efficient nonthermal acceleration operates only within the central @xmath86 , where the average proton energies resulting from the adaf solutions become relativistic .",
    "specifically , we assume that at each radius at @xmath87 a fraction of protons form a thermal distribution at a subrelativistic temperature of @xmath88 k ( @xmath89 ) , and the remaining form a power - law distribution ( equation [ eq : pldist ] ) with a constant ( i.e.  radius - independent ) index @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the relative normalization of these two distributions is determined by @xmath90 , \\label{psi2}\\ ] ] ( where the factor @xmath91 results from equation ( [ eq : uth ] ) with @xmath92 ) . at @xmath93 , where @xmath94 k , there are no non - thermal protons in this model , which then results in a negligible pion production at such distances , similar as in model t. the chosen value of @xmath88 k gives a smooth transition between a purely thermal and a hybrid plasma at @xmath95 , however , radiative properties of model h are roughly independent of the specific value of the temperature of the subrelativistic thermal component .",
    "we remark also that @xmath96 k is close to the limiting temperature above which the pion production prevents thermalization of protons ( see stepney 1983 , dermer 1986b )    the efficiency of pion production by protons with the power - law distribution increases with the decrease of the power - law index @xmath81 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction @xmath80 decreases with decreasing @xmath81 , roughly as @xmath97 .",
    "these two effects balance each other yielding the largest luminosity in 0.110 gev range , @xmath98 , for @xmath99 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath81 is weak ; for @xmath101 , @xmath98 is by a factor of @xmath102 smaller than for @xmath103 . to estimate the maximum value of @xmath98 that can be produced in a flow with given parameters , in our computations for models n and h we use @xmath103 . for all values of @xmath8 ,",
    "@xmath104 , and also @xmath105 in models h and n with @xmath103 , within the innermost several @xmath106 .    in our solutions of the flow structure",
    "we assume that protons are thermal and we use the thermal form of the gas pressure",
    ". then , our models n and h with non - thermal proton distributions are not strictly self - consistent , as their pressure may deviate from the thermal prescription",
    ". however , this is a rather small effect , e.g.  the pressure of the purely non - thermal distribution ( model n ) differs by 2030 per cent from the pressure of a thermal gas with the same internal energy .    for a given distribution of proton energies",
    "we determine the @xmath0-ray spectra in the flow rest frame , strictly following dermer ( 1986a,1986b ) , in a manner similar to m97 and om03 ; however , we do not apply the following simplification underlying their nonthermal model .",
    "as argued in m97 , the fraction of nonthermal protons should be small , @xmath107 , and , therefore , interactions of nonthermal protons with other nonthermal protons may be neglected ; hence , only interaction of nonthermal protons with cold protons are taken into account in their computations .",
    "we remark that such an approach underestimates the @xmath0-ray luminosity , e.g.  by a factor of @xmath102 in model n with @xmath108 and @xmath103 ( for which @xmath109 in the innermost region ) . in all our models",
    "we take into account interaction of protons with all other protons .    to compute the @xmath0-ray luminosity and spectra received by distant observers we use a monte carlo method similar to that described in niedwiecki ( 2005 ) .",
    "we generate @xmath0-ray photons isotropically in the plasma frame , make a lorentz transformation from the flow rest frame to the locally non rotating ( lnr ) frame and then we compute the transfer of @xmath0-ray photons in curved space - time ; see , e.g. , bardeen et al .",

    "we define @xmath61 integrated over the whole body of the flow as the total dissipation rate , @xmath192 , in our solutions and compare it to the dissipation rate in a keplerian disc for the corresponding value of @xmath8 , @xmath193 , given by the novikov & thorne model .",
    "obviously , @xmath192 does not need to match @xmath193 closely .",
    "the latter value is calculated under the assumption that the shear stress vanishes at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , which condition is not applicable to geometrically thick adafs and its release should lead to stronger dissipation . on the other hand ,",

    "our @xmath192 does not differ significantly from @xmath193 , however , the efficiency of dissipation in our model comparatively increases with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , @xmath194 for @xmath26 , @xmath195 for @xmath108 and @xmath196 for @xmath59 . note that in an adaf with a large value of @xmath8 most of the dissipation occurs very deep in the potential , where relativistic effects strongly reduce the energy escaping to infinity , whereas in a keplerian disc the dissipation is less centrally concentrated and its radiation is subject to less severe reduction .",
    "for example , the gravitational redshift alone ( neglecting , e.g. , the photon capture under the event horizon ) would give similar luminosities received by distant observers ( @xmath197 ) both in our adaf and in novikov & thorne models with @xmath59 , if all of the dissipated energy were converted into radiation .",
    "obviously , in optically thin adafs only a small part of the dissipated energy is radiated away and most of it is accreted by the black hole , so the radiative efficiency is much smaller than 0.3 .    as we mentioned in section",

    "the superhot solution has an extreme dissipation , with @xmath198@xmath199 .",
    "this is not necessarily an unphysical property ( note that @xmath192 is defined in the rest frame of the flow ) , as the observed luminosity of such flows does not exceed the accretion rate of the rest mass energy .",

    "such mhd simulations support some properties of our model , e.g.  the @xmath200 prescription of viscous heating ( ohsuga et al .",
    "furthermore , the gr mhd simulations have shown that flows cross the isco without any evidence that the shear stress goes to zero , which leads to the increase of the radiative efficiency , and the deviations from novikov & thorne model increase with increasing @xmath202 ratio ( e.g.  noble , krolik & hawley 2009 , penna et al .",
    "we could not , however , quantitatively compare our models with such simulations , as the published results have a much smaller aspect ratio than our solutions ( @xmath203 ) .",

    "we note that their results indicate a similar in magnitude stabilizing effect of the rotation of black hole .",
    "as pointed out by mahadevan & quataert ( 1998 ) , coulomb collisions are too inefficient to thermalize protons in optically thin flows and the proton distribution function is determined by the viscous heating mechanism , which is poorly understood",

    "assuming an acceleration rate @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the elementary charge and @xmath213 is the acceleration efficiency ( @xmath214 ) , we find that the maximum lorentz factor limited by the synchrotron energy loss is @xmath215 , depending on @xmath30 .",

    "the cross - section for both channels of proton - photon interactions is by over two orders of magnitude smaller than the cross - section for proton - proton interaction , making the photo - hadronic production of secondary particles negligible .",

    "the constraint of @xmath249 derived for this object in ackermann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) can still give interesting information if the spectral model constrains the parameters of the inner hot / outer cold accretion system ( in particular , the distance of transition between the two modes of accretion ) .",
    "the constraint of @xmath250 , or even @xmath251 for some objects , found for other seyfert galaxies by ackermann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is not strongly constraining for the spin value , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ( note that @xmath252 is by a factor of a few , depending on @xmath253 , larger than @xmath171 ) , especially for large x - ray luminosities ( and hence strong @xmath13 absorption ) characterising most of objects analysed in that paper .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0-ray emission resulting from proton - proton interactions in two - temperature adafs .",
    "our model relies on the global solutions of the gr hydrodynamical model , same as om03 , but we improve their computations by taking into account the relativistic transfer effects as well as the @xmath13 absorption and by properly describing the global comptonization process .",
    "we have found that the spin value is reflected in the properties of @xmath0-ray emission , but the effect is not thrilling .",
    "the speed of the black hole rotation strongly affects the @xmath0-ray emission produced within the innermost @xmath52 .",
    "if emission from that region dominates , the observed @xmath0-ray radiation depends on the spin parameter noticeably ; the intrinsic @xmath0-ray luminosities of flows around rapidly - rotating and non - rotating black holes differ by over a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "however , if the @xmath0-ray emitting region extends to larger distances , the dependence is reduced . in the most extreme case with protons",
    "efficiently accelerated to relativistic energies in the whole body of the flow , the regions within and beyond @xmath52 give comparable contributions to the total emission , reducing the difference of @xmath0-ray luminosities between high and low values of @xmath8 to only a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "the radial emissivity profile of @xmath0-rays is very uncertain ( as the acceleration efficiency may change with radius ) , then , the level of the @xmath0-ray luminosity can not be regarded as a very sensitive probe of the spin value .",
    "still , it may be possible to assess a slow rotation in a low luminosity object by putting an upper limit on the @xmath0-ray luminosity at the level of @xmath254 of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "the presence of nonthermal protons may be easily assessed from the @xmath0-ray spectrum as for a purely thermal plasma the total @xmath0-ray emission would be observed only at energies lower than 1 gev .",
    "we have considered the accretion rate of @xmath46 , for which our model gives the bolometric luminosities between @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "such @xmath75 , with the corresponding range of @xmath257 , seems to be favoured for investigation of the hadronic @xmath0-ray emission , with the related effects of the space - time metric , because the internal @xmath0-ray emission is large and its attenuation by @xmath13 absorption is weak .",
    "flows with @xmath258 can produce observable @xmath0-ray radiation only if the emitting region extends out to a rather large distance of several tens of @xmath106 .",
    "we have found the x - ray to @xmath0-ray luminosities ratio as a function of the black hole spin and the efficiency of the direct heating of electrons .",
    "the @xmath180 ratios reaching @xmath259 , with the corresponding levels of the @xmath0-ray luminosities which may be probed in nearby agns at the current sensitivity of _ fermi_-lat surveys , encourage to consider contribution from an accretion flow to the @xmath0-ray emission observed in low - luminosity objects .",
    "we point out that such a contribution should be strong at least in cen a.    the @xmath0-ray luminosity decreases rapidly ( @xmath260 ) with decreasing @xmath75 .",
    "m87 and sgr a@xmath224 are the obvious , however possibly also unique , objects for which the @xmath0-ray emission from the flow can be searched at @xmath261 . obviously , contribution from other @xmath0-ray emitting sites should be properly subtracted to establish the luminosity of an accretion flow , which may be particularly difficult in sgr a@xmath224 . the adaf model with a hard ( acceleration index @xmath262 )",
    "nonthermal proton distribution can explain the @xmath0-ray detections of both sgr a@xmath224 ( above 100 gev ) and m87 , however , it does not allow for strong reduction of the accretion rate by outflows .",
    "nevertheless , it seems intriguing that in both nearby , low accretion - rate objects , in which the @xmath0-ray radiation is not suppressed by @xmath13 absorption , observations reveal very high energy components , consistent with predictions of such a model . in both objects",
    "the model requires a large black hole spin .",
    "the luminosity ratio should decrease rather slowly ( @xmath263 , as the radiative efficiency of hot flows varies as @xmath264 at small @xmath75 ; cf .",
    "xie & yuan 2012 ) with decreasing @xmath75 .",
    "the presence of the @xmath0-ray signal in low - luminosity agns is often considered as the evidence for the origin of their radiation in a jet ( see , e.g. , takami 2011 ) .",
    "we note that such a diagnostic is not valid because accretion flows may produce a similarly strong @xmath0-ray emission as jets in such objects .",
