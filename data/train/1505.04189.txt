    "macroscopic objects from our daily experience can have a total angular momentum , @xmath0 , larger than their total mass , @xmath1 , squared : @xmath4 in fact , in view of the si values of newton s constant @xmath5 and of the speed of light , @xmath6 , this is inevitable for objects with @xmath7 . for such objects",
    " for instance , a spinning football ",
    "@xmath8 is many orders of magnitude above unity .",
    "in essence , this is because electromagnetic interactions , rather than gravity , keep the object s structure .",
    "by contrast , self - gravitating _ compact _ objects , for which the total energy is dominated by gravitational binding energy , should have @xmath9 . indeed , considering one such object with radius @xmath10 , and requiring that the magnitude of the gravitational binding energy @xmath11 should not be smaller than the object s rotational energy @xmath12",
    ", implies that @xmath13 .",
    "thus , if the system has a dimension of the order of its gravitational radius @xmath14 , then @xmath9 .",
    "this agrees with what is inferred from the most general vacuum , stationary , asymptotically flat , four - dimensional black hole ( bh ) solution of general relativity , the kerr metric  @xcite .",
    "this solution obeys the _ kerr bound _ , @xmath15 .",
    "as argued in the misner - thorne - wheeler treatise  @xcite  it seems likely that in any collapsing body which violates this constraint , centrifugal forces ( ... ) will halt the collapse before a size @xmath16 is reached \" .    the above heuristic arguments make plausible that any physically reasonable bh solution should obey @xmath17 as a ballpark estimate . for the kerr bh",
    "the bound is actually _ strict _ , @xmath15 , a result that has been extended to vacuum , _ dynamical _ , axi - symmetric and asymptotically flat bhs  @xcite .",
    "is , thus , this strict kerr bound a fundamental relation for _ any _ four dimensional , asymptotically flat and physically reasonable bh ?",
    "to answer the above question it suffices to exhibit a bh solution violating the kerr bound . a sharp example , discovered recently , corresponds to kerr bhs with scalar hair ( kbhssh )  @xcite .",
    "these are solutions for a free complex scalar field with mass @xmath18 , minimally coupled to einstein s gravity .",
    "they describe asymptotically flat , spinning bhs in equilibrium with scalar  hair \" around them . both the geometry and the scalar field",
    "are regular on and outside the horizon , and the solutions interpolate continuously between ( a subset of ) vacuum kerr bhs and horizonless gravitating solitons called _ boson stars _  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite it was observed that kbhssh violate the kerr bound - fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left panel ) , a result very recently independently confirmed  @xcite .",
    "this observation was made in terms of the adm mass @xmath1 and angular momentum @xmath0 ; these take into account both the bh mass @xmath19 and angular momentum @xmath20  which can be computed as komar integrals on the horizon  as well as the mass , @xmath21 , and angular momentum , @xmath22 , stored in the scalar field outside the horizon .",
    "it is possible for these bhs to compute these individual contributions  @xcite : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and therefore it is legitimate to ask if the kerr bound violation remains in terms of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , a question not yet addressed .",
    "this point is clarified in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right panel ) , where it is shown that the kerr bound is also violated in terms of horizon quantities for kbhssh ; indeed @xmath25 takes values greater than one for some of the  hairy \" solutions .",
    "having established that the _ strict _ kerr bound is not general , it is pertinent to ask if there is any universal bound on bh rotation .",
    "one bound was suggested in  @xcite for axi - symmetric , possibly dynamical and non - vacuum , spacetimes .",
    "it was formulated in terms of quasi - local quantities of an apparent horizon : its area @xmath26 and @xmath20 .",
    "the bound reads @xmath27 .",
    "we have checked that this bound is verified by the solutions described in section 2 .",
    "this bound , however , as the kerr bound , is not truly a bound on bh _ rotation _ , but rather on the bh s angular momentum , which is not the same .",
    "indeed there are both rotations with zero total angular momentum  for instance a cat malevolently dropped from rest upside down and which lands on its feet  , and objects with total non - zero angular momentum which have no rotation .",
    "both situations can be illustrated in bh physics , albeit higher dimensional , in the black saturn system  @xcite . here",
    ", we shall look for a bound on bh rotation , instead .",
    "a detour through elementary physics is suggestive .    in rigid body mechanics , the angular momentum for rotations around a principal axis of inertia",
    "is related to the angular velocity @xmath28 by the moment of inertia @xmath29 : @xmath30 .",
    "a peripheral point , at distance @xmath10 from the axis has a linear velocity @xmath31 . imposing special relativity , @xmath32",
    ", one obtains a bound on the angular momentum @xmath33 .",
    "the moment of inertia is related to the total mass @xmath1 of the rigid body and the different scales of the object .",
    "referring all of the latter to @xmath10 gives @xmath34 .",
    "the constant @xmath35 is smaller than one if @xmath10 is the largest scale of the body , but it may be larger than one if larger scales exist .",
    "thus @xmath36 . finally , imposing @xmath10 to be of the order of the gravitational radius leads , again , to an approximate kerr bound : @xmath37 .",
    "there are two suggestions from these heuristic arguments ( even though a bh spacetime is _ not _ a rigid body ! ) .",
    "firstly , that one may interpret a violation of the strict kerr bound as due to a change in the rotational inertia of the system .",
    "this will be expanded in section  6 . secondly , that an approximate kerr bound also results from limiting linear velocities by @xmath38 .",
    "this indicates it may be useful to define a _",
    "horizon linear velocity _ for rotating bhs .",
    "we define a horizon linear velocity for asymptotically flat , stationary and axi - symmetric spacetimes as follows .",
    "let @xmath39 be the killing vector field associated with the @xmath40 axi - symmetry",
    ". on a spatial section of the event horizon one computes the proper length of all closed orbits of @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the maximum of all such proper lengths , which is finite , since the spatial sections of the horizon are compact and the orbits of @xmath39 are closed .",
    "then we define the _ circumferencial radius _ , @xmath42 , as @xmath43 the horizon linear velocity , @xmath3 , is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the horizon , as usually defined by the killing vector for which the event horizon is a killing horizon ( see @xmath46  @xcite ) .",
    "if one introduces coordinates adapted to the @xmath40 symmetry , such that @xmath47 , @xmath48 , then @xmath3 is simply computed as @xmath49 \\omega_h \\ .\\ ] ] for @xmath50 invariant bh solutions , @xmath41 should occur at the @xmath50 invariant point , @xmath51 , on the equator .",
    "this is the typical case , but our definition allows for non - typical cases as well .",
    "we propose that for any four dimensional , stationary and axi - symmetric , asymptotically flat , rotating bh @xmath52",
    "to test the bound ( [ vhbound ] ) we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] @xmath3 @xmath53 @xmath8 ( left panel ) and @xmath3 @xmath53 @xmath54 ( right panel ) for kbhssh ( blue shaded region ) and also for the kerr solution ( red solid line ) , in which case @xmath55 .",
    "the plots show that the @xmath3 bound is always verified , even when the kerr bound is violated for kbhssh .",
    "moreover , the @xmath3 bound is only saturated for the extremal kerr solution .    we have also confirmed ( [ vhbound ] ) for the kerr - newman bh and other charged rotating solutions in general relativity .",
    "one interpretation for @xmath56 even when @xmath57 is the aforementioned variation in the rotational inertia .",
    "` dirty ' bhs , @xmath58 with surrounding matter , have additional ballast in their rotational motion , hence a larger  moment of inertia \" .",
    "they are therefore able to accommodate more specific angular momentum than a vacuum kerr bh , since for comparable horizon charges they have a lower horizon linear velocity .",
    "toll of heavy dragging \" has been proposed in  @xcite based on the analysis of exotic solutions .",
    "kbhssh are a clean example that supports the idea .",
    "perhaps methods used in establishing bounds for quasi - local quantities , @xmath46  @xcite , can be used to _ demonstrate _ ( [ vhbound ] ) . on the other hand , it has not escaped our attention that this bound does not apply straightforwardly to higher dimensional bhs .",
    "generalizations that apply to this case will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "finally , it is inspiring that , 100 years after general relativity was formulated , one is unveiling the basic postulate of _ special _ relativity in answering the question posed as the title of this essay and concerning the ( arguably ) most fascinating object predicted by general relativity : _ the rotation of a bh can not exceed the speed of light_.",
