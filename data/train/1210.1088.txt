    "the notion of quantum entanglement is one of the main current research subjects in quantum information theory as well as quantum physics , where the fundamental question is , of course , how to distinguish entangled states from separable ones @xcite .",
    "one of useful criteria is to use the notion of partial transpose , as it was observed by choi @xcite and peres @xcite : the partial transpose of a separable state is still positive , that is , positive semi - definite , but the converse is not true . even though we have a more complete criterion using positive linear maps @xcite , it is not so easy to apply this criterion due to the current stage of poor understanding on positive linear maps .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the convex set of all separable states on @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the algebra of all @xmath7 matrices over the complex field .",
    "a state is called separable if it is a convex combination of pure product states .",
    "therefore , every separable state is of the form @xmath8 with unit product vectors @xmath9 and positive numbers @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 .",
    "a non - separable state is called entangled .",
    "the partial transpose @xmath12 of a state @xmath13 is obtained by taking the transpose in the first component .",
    "then the partial transpose of a separable state in ( [ sep ] ) is given by @xmath14 which is still positive , where @xmath15 denotes the vector whose entries are the complex conjugates of the corresponding entries of the vector @xmath16 .",
    "the product vector @xmath17 is called the partial conjugate of @xmath18 .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the convex set of all states whose partial transposes are positive .",
    "the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion tells us that the relation @xmath20 holds .",
    "these two convex sets coincide if and only if @xmath21 , as it was shown by woronowicz @xcite , choi @xcite and horodecki s @xcite .",
    "we note that the boundary between separable states and entangled ones consists of faces of the convex set @xmath4 , and so it is very important to understand the whole facial structures of @xmath22 .",
    "first of all , we note that every extreme point of @xmath4 is a pure product state @xmath23 .",
    "the next step to understand the facial structures of @xmath4 is naturally to find faces of @xmath4 which are affinely isomorphic to simplices .",
    "we call those _ simplicial faces_. we recall that a convex subset @xmath24 of a convex set @xmath25 is said to be a face of @xmath25 is the following property hold : @xmath26 we note that every point @xmath27 in a convex set determines a unique face in which @xmath27 is an interior point with respect to the relative topology given by the affine manifold generated by the face .",
    "this is the smallest face containing the point @xmath27 . by definition of face , it is clear that the following two statements for a separable state @xmath13 of the form ( [ sep ] ) are equivalent :    * @xmath13 determines a simplicial face . *",
    "the decomposition ( [ sep ] ) of @xmath13 is unique .",
    "it was shown by kirkpatrick @xcite that if @xmath28 is pairwise distinct up to constant multiplications and @xmath29 is linearly independent then the decomposition ( [ sep ] ) is unique .",
    "this result was also found by alfsen and shultz @xcite independently in the context of facial structures .",
    "see also @xcite for further progresses .",
    "recently , chen and djokovi @xcite extended this result to show that if product vectors in ( [ sep ] ) with @xmath30 satisfy a suitable linear independence condition for each subsystem then they are linearly independent and @xmath31 are the only product vectors in the span of them .",
    "this clearly implies that the separable states determined by these vectors have unique decompositions .",
    "we note that this result covers the cases when the ranks of separable states do not exceed @xmath32 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to search for separable states with unique decompositions whose ranks exceed the number @xmath32 .    in the two - qutrit case",
    ", it is well known that generic five dimensional subspaces of @xmath33 have exactly six product vectors @xmath34 , and their orthogonal complements have no product vectors .",
    "we show that these six product vectors give rise to a simplicial face isomorphic to the @xmath35-simplex @xmath36 whose interior consists of separable states of rank five .",
    "the interiors of the six maximal faces , isomorphic to the @xmath37-simplex @xmath38 , also consist of separable states of rank five .",
    "the interiors of the next fifteen maximal faces , isomorphic to the @xmath39-simplex @xmath40 , consist of separable states of rank four , and so on .",
    "we consider the set @xmath24 of all ppt states whose ranges are contained in the span of @xmath34 such that the ranges of partial conjugates are contained in the span of @xmath41 .",
    "this is a face of the convex set @xmath19 consisting of all ppt states @xcite .",
    "if the partial conjugates of six product vectors also span the @xmath35-dimensional space , then we see that the face @xmath36 ( we use the same notion with the simplex itself ) is inscribed in @xmath24 so that fifteen faces @xmath40 are located on the boundary of @xmath24 . with a mild additional condition",
    ", we also show that the interior of six maximal faces @xmath38 are contained in the interior of @xmath24 .",
    "remaining boundary of @xmath24 consists of ppt entangled edge states of rank four , which are extreme points of @xmath24 .",
    "we also show that every edge state of rank four arises in this way . from this , we see that every ppt entangled edge state of rank four is the difference of scalar multiples of two separable states with rank five .",
    "we have another byproducts with this picture .",
    "we see that if we take two boundary points of @xmath24 so that they are outside   of different maximal faces , then the convex sums of these two points intersect separable states in @xmath36 .",
    "this gives an affirmative answer to the problem 1 in @xcite which asks if a sum of two extreme ppt entangled states may be separable . for a given entangled state , it is an important problem to find the nearest separable state .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for generic @xmath0 ppt entangled states of rank five , our picture gives a simple method to find the nearest separable state within the face of ppt states determined by @xmath13 .    in the above discussion",
    ", it may happen that the partial conjugates of six product vectors span the @xmath42-dimensional space .",
    "in this case , we also have a simplicial face isomorphic to the @xmath35-simplex @xmath36 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the interior points @xmath13 of this face have unique decompositions but have asymmetric ranks : @xmath43 .",
    "it turns out that the convex combinations of them and the edge states of rank five constructed in @xcite give rise to ppt states @xmath13 of type @xmath44 , that is , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "ppt states of such type were missing in a numerical search @xcite , but the existence has been noticed in @xcite . we give explicit examples of such states .",
    "the _ length _ of a separable state @xmath13 is defined by the minimum number @xmath47 for which the expression ( [ sep ] ) is possible .",
    "horodecki @xcite showed that the length of an @xmath48 separable state does not exceed @xmath49 .",
    "the notion of length was defined in @xcite , where it was shown that the length is invariant under the operation of partial transpose , and so the length may be strictly greater than the rank of the state .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "our picture also gives concrete examples .",
    "any separable state @xmath13 in the interior of @xmath36 has length six , while rank of @xmath13 is five .",
    "the rank of @xmath12 may be five or six .",
    "therefore , there exists a state @xmath13 whose length is greater than the rank of the state even in the case of @xmath50 .",
    "but the lengths of these examples do not exceed @xmath51 .",
    "now , it is natural to ask if there exists an @xmath48 separable state of length exceeding the number @xmath51 . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "chen and djokovi showed that such a separable state exists when @xmath52 , and conjectured ( * ? ? ? * conjecture 10 ) that a certain number may be the maximum length . by this conjecture",
    ", the length of @xmath0 separable states do not exceed @xmath53 .",
    "we note that the face @xmath36 of @xmath4 is induced by the face @xmath24 of @xmath19 , in the sense that @xmath36 is the intersection of @xmath4 and a face @xmath24 of @xmath19 .",
    "we call such faces of @xmath4 _ induced _ ones , as it was introduced in @xcite .",
    "note that the maximal faces @xmath38 are not induced .",
    "we construct a simplicial face isomorphic to the @xmath53-simplex @xmath54 with ten extreme points .",
    "this face is turned out to be non - induced .",
    "our construction gives an example of a @xmath55 separable state whose length is @xmath56 , to disprove the conjecture mentioned above .",
    "we note that a face of a face is again a face .",
    "therefore , we have simplicial faces with arbitrary affine dimensions less than @xmath56 , considering faces of @xmath54 ,    in the @xmath57 cases , the results in @xcite give us simplicial faces isomorphic to the @xmath58-simplex .",
    "we show for @xmath59 that @xmath60 choices of vectors in @xmath61 also give rise to simplicial faces isomorphic to the @xmath62-simplex @xmath63 , under suitable linear independence assumption . in this case",
    ", we do not have the pictures as in the @xmath0 case , since there is no ppt entangled states outside of @xmath64 .",
    "we note that the convex hull of @xmath65 is a simplex if and only if they are linearly independent in the _ real _ vector space of all hermitian matrices .",
    "it should be noted that this convex hull need not to be a face .",
    "in this context , we begin this paper to search for conditions on the family @xmath34 for which @xmath66 is linearly independent in the next section . in section [ sec : qutrit ] , we consider the @xmath0 case to describe the picture explained above , and construct separable states with unique decompositions which have asymmetric ranks in section [ spa ] .",
    "we explain the notion of induced faces of @xmath4 in section [ indeced_face ] , and construct a @xmath0 separable state which determines the face isomorphic to the @xmath53-simplex @xmath54 .",
    "finally , we consider the @xmath67 cases in section [ sec : qubit - qudit ] , and discuss briefly higher dimensional cases and related problems in the final section .",
    "in this section , we investigate to what extent pure product states may be linearly independent . for this purpose ,",
    "the notions of _ generalized unextendible product basis _ and _ general position _ are very useful .",
    "these two notions play central roles for the description of @xmath0 ppt entangled states of rank four , as it was developed independently by skowronek @xcite , and chen and djokovi @xcite .",
    "a finite family of product vectors @xmath34 is said be a generalized unextendible product basis if there is no product vector in the orthogonal complement of the span of @xmath34 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the set @xmath68 with @xmath69 is a generalized unextendible product basis if and only if for any partition @xmath70 , at least one of @xmath71 or @xmath72 spans the whole spaces .",
    "on the other hand , a family of product vectors @xmath73 is said to be in general position if for any @xmath74 with @xmath75 the set @xmath76 is linearly independent , and for any @xmath77 with @xmath78 the set @xmath79 is linearly independent , where @xmath80 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that product vectors @xmath82 with @xmath69 in general position form a generalized unextendible product basis .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath83 then they are in general position if and only if they form a generalized unextendible product basis .",
    "therefore , two notions are equivalent for five product vectors in @xmath84 . for six product vectors in @xmath84",
    ", there exists a generalized unextendible product basis which is not in general position .",
    "see the last paragraph of section [ sec : qutrit ] for such a concrete example . therefore , these two notions are different in general .",
    "it was shown in lemma 28 of @xcite that if @xmath85 with @xmath30 is in general position then they are linearly independent and @xmath86 are the only product vectors in the span of them .",
    "it is clear that if a set of product vectors is linearly independent then the corresponding pure product states are also linearly independent , but the converse is not true .",
    "therefore , this result tells us that they determines a simplicial face . in the @xmath0 case , this gives us a simplicial face isomorphic to the @xmath39-simplex @xmath40 , as it was explained in introduction .",
    "focusing on the linear independence , we have the following :    [ prop : prod_vec ] let @xmath87 . if @xmath47 product vectors @xmath88 are in general position in @xmath89 , then they are linearly independent .",
    "we may assume that @xmath90 .",
    "suppose that @xmath91 . for any vector @xmath92 in the orthogonal complement of the space @xmath93",
    ", we see that @xmath94 since product vectors @xmath86 are in general position .",
    "we define a linear map @xmath95 from @xmath89 to @xmath96 by @xmath97",
    ". then we have @xmath98 note that @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath100 vectors @xmath101 are linearly independent and @xmath102 for @xmath103 , we see that all @xmath104 for @xmath103 .",
    "this implies that @xmath105 , and thus we see that @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "consequently , we get @xmath106 for all @xmath108 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we note that a @xmath55 ppt entangled edge state with rank four has the @xmath35-dimensional kernel which has six product vectors in general position by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the number @xmath109 in proposition [ prop : prod_vec ] is the best choice at least for the case of @xmath110 .",
    "we have seen that product vectors in general position give rise to linearly independent pure product vector states whenever the number of vectors is less than @xmath111 .",
    "the following proposition extends this .",
    "[ prop : simplex ] let @xmath112 . if @xmath47 product vectors @xmath113 are in general position in @xmath89 , then the corresponding pure product states are linearly independent .    from proposition  [ prop : prod_vec ] ,",

    "so we may assume that @xmath115 .",

    "this completes the proof .    as for the product vectors which form a generalized unextendible product basis",
    ", we have the following :    [ 3x3 ] suppose that six product vectors @xmath129 in @xmath33 are pairwise distinct , and form a generalized unextendible product basis .",

    "consider two sets @xmath131 and @xmath132 from product vectors . by assumption ,",
    "at least one of them , say @xmath133 , spans the whole space @xmath134 . then , we see the following @xmath135 for each @xmath136 , by assumption . therefore , for each @xmath136 , we can choose two vectors @xmath137 and @xmath138 in @xmath139 such that @xmath140 .",

    "consequently , we see that @xmath158 from the following equation @xmath159 finally , we see that @xmath160 . this completes the proof .",
    "very recently , it was shown in @xcite that if a separable state @xmath13 in ( [ sep ] ) is not uniquely decomposed then there exists a subset @xmath161 with the cardinality @xmath162 satisfying @xmath163 if @xmath30 then this inequality is very useful to infer unique decomposition of a separable state .",
    "indeed , if @xmath30 and @xmath164 in ( [ sep ] ) is in general position then every subset @xmath165 violates this inequality , and so we get the unique decomposition .",
    "this recovers the result in @xcite . on the other hand , if @xmath166 then the value of the left hand side of ( [ cohen - inq ] ) is @xmath111 in most cases , and the inequality is not violated in these cases .",

    "we will concentrate on the rank five separable states , since states of rank up to four are covered by the results in @xcite , as it was discussed already .",
    "we begin with the following simple observation , as it was discussed in introduction .",

    "similarily , we can show that @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , @xmath172 is a face of @xmath4 .",
    "we note that generic four dimensional subspaces of @xmath33 have no product vectors , and their orthogonal complements have exactly six product vectors @xmath180 and proposition [ prel ] , we see that a convex combination of product states @xmath181 with @xmath182 has a unique decomposition , and determines a face @xmath36 of the convex set @xmath4 of all separable states .",
    "this face is affinely isomorphic to the @xmath35-simplex with six extreme points . the state @xmath183 is located at the center of the simplicial face @xmath36 .",

    "existence of such separable states has been claimed in @xcite without explicit construction .    from now on throughout this section",
    ", we suppose that the partial conjugates of ( [ 6-prod ] ) also span the @xmath35-dimensional space .",

    "if three of them , say @xmath452 , span a @xmath453-dimensional space @xmath454 of @xmath134 , then @xmath455 is contained in @xmath456 , and so the face determined by @xmath457 contains already infinitely many extreme points by theorem [ 2xn_thm ] ( i ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath167 must be in general position .    in the case of @xmath440 ,",
    "all pairs of subspaces giving nontrivial faces are classified in @xcite .",
    "the possible pairs @xmath458 of natural numbers arising from non - trivial faces are listed by @xmath459 if we take an interior point @xmath13 of the face @xmath308 then these numbers are nothing but @xmath460 .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath461 case gives rise to the @xmath462-simplices consisting of single points . for the @xmath463 case ,",
    "we take an interior point @xmath464 with product vectors @xmath465 .",
    "then we see that this face is simplicial if and only if @xmath466 is in general position .",
    "if this is the case , then we have @xmath467-simplices .",
    "we show that these are all possible cases . to do this ,",
    "suppose that a state @xmath13 with expression ( [ sep ] ) is an interior point of a simplicial face @xmath308 .",
    "the case @xmath468 is split into two subcases : either both @xmath469 and @xmath303 are spanned by product vectors @xmath470 and @xmath471 , respectively , or both of them are spanned by non - product vectors . in the first case , it is clear that there are infinitely many extreme points . in the second case , we note that three product vectors are in general position if and only if they form a generalized unextendible product basis .",
    "therefore , we see that there are also infinitely many extreme points in this case by theorem [ 2xn_thm ] ( i ) . in the @xmath472 case , @xmath469 is spanned by a product vector , and we see that there are infinitely many product vectors in @xmath473 by lemma 10 of @xcite .",
    "all of them give rise to extreme points of the face of @xmath308 .",
    "we turn our attention to the @xmath441 case . in this case",
    ", we have the following possibilities : @xmath474 by @xcite . here",
    ", we list up the cases @xmath274 with @xmath475 by the symmetry .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 of the form ( [ sep ] ) determines a simplicial face isomorphic to the @xmath47-simplex .",
    "if @xmath476 , then this face must be of type @xmath477 by the above list .",
    "we next consider the case @xmath478 . in this case",
    ", @xmath479 is in general position by proposition [ cor-2xn ] , and so their partial conjugates are also in general position .",
    "therefore , both @xmath480 and @xmath481 are linearly independent by proposition [ prop : prod_vec ] .",
    "this show that the face must be of type @xmath482 , and a face of type @xmath472 is never a simplicial face . in most @xmath482 cases",
    ", they actually determines a simplicial faces isomorphic to the @xmath39-simplex by theorem [ 2xn_thm ] ( ii ) . for a face @xmath308 of type @xmath483",
    ", we consider product vectors @xmath484 and @xmath485 for @xmath486 , where @xmath487 is the third root of unity .",
    "it is simple to check that these five product vectors satisfy the conditions in proposition [ prop : induced_face ] .",
    "therefore , we have a simplicial face isomorphic to @xmath36 . for the @xmath488 and @xmath288 cases",
    ", we also refer to lemma 10 of @xcite to see that there are infinitely many extreme points .",
    "in a recent preprint @xcite , it was shown in lemma 10 that if @xmath489 for subspaces @xmath473 and @xmath302 of @xmath61 then there are infinitely many product vectors in @xmath473 whose partial conjugates belong to @xmath302 .",
    "therefore , it is a simple consequence of this result that there is no simplicial face of type @xmath278 .",
    "we analyzed the convex geometry of the convex set @xmath4 consisting of all @xmath0 separable states to compare with the convex set @xmath19 consisting of ppt states . with this geometric reasoning",
    ", we could show that every ppt entangled edge state of rank four arises as the difference of two separable states of rank five .",
    "for the higher dimensional cases , we recall that the maximal dimension of subspaces in @xmath168 without product vector is given by @xmath490 and generic @xmath491-dimensional subspaces contain exactly @xmath492 numbers of product vectors up to scalar multiplications .",
    "see @xcite . in the @xmath0 case",
    ", we exploited the strict inequality @xmath493 to get the picture shown in figure 1 . in the @xmath494 case",
    ", we have @xmath495 and @xmath496 .",
    "if these ten product vectors are in general position then they give rise to a simplicial face isomorphic to the @xmath53-simplex by proposition [ prop : simplex ] .",
    "six of them must be linearly independent by proposition [ prop : prod_vec ] , but we could not determine if seven of them are linearly independent in general or not . if @xmath497 , then the the number @xmath498 exceeds eventually the whole dimension @xmath499 .",
    "therefore , we can not expect linear independence of corresponding product states as in proposition [ prop : simplex ]",
    ". it would be interesting to know to what extent our approach may work .",
    "we also have constructed separable states with unique decompositions , but with asymmetric ranks . as an application",
    ", we constructed an explicit example of a @xmath55 ppt entangled state of type @xmath273 . in the @xmath67 cases ,",
    "the situations go in a very different way , because @xmath500 for these cases . even though we found simplicial faces with @xmath60 vertices ,",
    "these do not give the pictures as in figure 1 , because the corresponding product vectors are already linearly independent .",
    "this may explain why it is very difficult to construct ppt entangled edge states of various types in the @xmath67 cases .",
    "in fact , it is still open if there exists a @xmath501 ppt entangled edge state of type @xmath502 .",
