    "their renormalization prescription is such that this leading term can be compared directly to ours .",
    "the subleading terms in ( [ kr - answer ] ) are scheme dependent , except for a universal logarithmic term @xcite .",
    "the agreement with our result ( [ dm - answer2 ] ) is striking . because of the divergence as @xmath43 , for plotting purposes it is useful to extract the overall factor of @xmath122 . in figure [ fig8 ]",
    "we plot our result ( [ dm - answer2 ] ) , rescaled by a factor of @xmath120 , compared with the konoplich - rubin thin - wall approximation answer ( [ kr - answer ] ) , also rescaled by a factor of @xmath120 .",

    "the @xmath96 prescription provides simple renormalization structures , but we can also use a `` physical '' renormalization prescription .",
    "for example , we may impose the following normalization condition to the one - loop effective potential , ( u_cl+u_eff)|_=_1= ( 3_1 ^ 2-a^2 ) , ( u_cl+u_eff)|_=_1= 3 .",
    "[ normal ] in ( [ normal ] ) , @xmath123 is the solution of the one - loop modified field equation ( u_cl+u_eff)|_=_1=0 .",
    "these normalization conditions can be satisfied when we change the renormalized parameters by finite amounts as @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a simple and practical technique for evaluating the prefactor determinant in the expression for the metastable decay rate in scalar field theories .",
    "the technique for computing the determinant is based on the gelfand - yaglom formula @xcite for computing the determinant of a one - dimensional ( here , radial ) differential operator in terms of the asymptotic boundary value of an associated differential equation with initial value boundary conditions .",
    "this technique is extremely easy to implement for any given partial wave , but the naive sum over partial waves is divergent .",
    "thus the direct application of the gelfand - yaglom formula to higher dimensions is not possible .",
    "however , this divergence can be regulated in various ways . here",
    "we propose using the _ angular momentum cutoff _ regularization and renormalization scheme , which has been used previously to compute the explicit mass dependence of the fermion determinant in qcd for massive quarks in an instanton background @xcite . in this approach",
    "the contribution of the low partial waves is computed numerically using the gelfand - yaglom formula , while the contribution of the high partial waves is computed analytically using radial wkb , which is a good approximation for large @xmath56 .",
    "the merging of these two parts involves renormalization and we have illustrated our technique using an @xmath96 scheme in order to compare with the work of baacke and lavrelashvili @xcite , who also use the gelfand - yaglom technique , also with an @xmath96 prescription , but with a different regularization technique .",
    "we have shown that the two techniques agree , and have argued that the one presented here is somewhat easier to implement as it is purely _ local _ in the numerically determined fluctuation potential .",
    "the conversion to other renormalization shemes can be done using conventional field theory techniques , and corresponds to including finite polynomial terms in the effective potential .",
    "in an appendix we have derived a simple new formula for the @xmath65 determinant with the zero modes removed , solely in terms of the asymptotic values of the bounce solution .",
    "the goal of this work has been to reduce the computation of field theoretic one loop fluctuation determinants to a straightforward numerical exercise . as a by - product",
    ", we have found in ( [ dm - answer2 ] ) a simple extension of the gelfand - yaglom result to higher dimensional radially separable problems .",
    "there are many possible further applications of this technique , as there are many semiclassical problems where the classical solution , about which one is computing the quantum fluctuations , has radial symmetry .",
    "closely related possible applications include : ( i ) metastable decay in theories with more than one field @xcite , where analytic and approximate approaches to the prefactor are quite difficult , but a direct numerical approach might be more useful ; ( ii ) models in dimensions other than 4 , which have been studied in and beyond the thin - wall approximation @xcite ; ( iii ) an extension to finite temperature , where the high temperature limit is essentially a dimensionally reduced 3d radial problem @xcite , but for intermediate temperatures the explicit summation over matsubara modes is necessary .",
    "this technique for computing precisely the fluctuation contribution may also be useful for a set of fascinating questions concerning the validity of langer s homogeneous nucleation picture itself , as well as the semiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "more generally , our technique for extending the gelfand - yaglom formula to higher dimensions can also be applied to other symmetric semiclassical configurations such as vortices and monopoles ( instantons were considered already in @xcite ) .",

    "in this appendix we present a derivation of the expression ( [ zmformula ] ) for the factor contributed by the @xmath65 zero modes .",
    "we adapt a method of mckane and tarlie @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "first , add a small quantity , @xmath126 , to the operator possessing the zero mode , and to the corresponding free operator ( although this latter addition is not important in the end ) .",
    "then for small @xmath126 the existence of the four zero modes for @xmath127 [ we suppress the @xmath128 subscript ] implies that ~(k^2)^4 , k^20 .",
    "[ addk ] the result ( [ theorem ] ) means we can evaluate the lhs of ( [ addk ] ) for arbitrary but small @xmath126 as = ( _ r ( ) ) ^4 , [ zmratio ] where @xmath129 satisfies -_k^2 ^ -_k^2^+(+1+k^2+v(r))_k^2&=&0 , + _ k^2(0)=0 ; ^_k^2(0)=1 .",
    "& & [ psik ] note that for @xmath65 we can express the @xmath130 boundary conditions ( [ r0bc ] ) in this initial value form .",
    "the function @xmath131 satisfies the same equation and boundary conditions as in ( [ psik ] ) , but with the potential @xmath132 set to 0 .",
    "so , one possible approach , as suggested in @xcite , to computing @xmath133 is to compute the derivative of @xmath134 as @xmath135 .",
    "but a more direct and accurate method is as follows .",
    "define the function @xmath136 to be the solution of ( [ psik ] ) with @xmath137 . then by elementary integration by parts it follows that 0&=&_0^r dr r^3 _ 0 \\{-(r^3 _ k^2^)^+(+1+k^2+v(r))_k^2 } + & = & ^r_0 + k^2 _ 0^r dr r^3 _ 0 _ k^2 .",
    "[ byparts ] applying the boundary conditions at @xmath33 we obtain _ k^2(r)(1-)=k^2 .",
    "[ magic ] the important observation now is that @xmath136 is actually the normalizable zero mode of @xmath127 , and decreases exponentially as @xmath138 at large @xmath30 . on the other hand , for arbitrarily small but nonzero @xmath126 , the solution @xmath139 _ increases _ exponentially as @xmath140 at large @xmath30 .",
    "thus at large @xmath141 and arbitrarily small but nonzero @xmath126 , the identity ( [ magic ] ) implies that the leading @xmath126 dependence at small @xmath126 is : _",
    "k^2(r)~k^2 , k^20 .",
    "[ magic2 ] then ( [ zmratio ] ) leads to the following expression for the determinant with zero mode removed : = ( ) ^4 .",
    "[ zeroremoved ]    to simplify this general expression further , recall that the zero mode @xmath142 can be expressed in terms of the classical bounce solution : _ 0(r)= .",
    "[ bouncezm ] this has two important implications .",
    "first , the numerator on the rhs of ( [ zeroremoved ] ) can be expressed in terms of the classical bounce action : _",
    "0^dr r^3 _ 0 ^ 2&= & d^4 x ( ^)^2 + & = & 4 s_cl [ ] [ innerproduct ] since @xmath143 is raised to the power @xmath50 on the lhs of ( [ zmformula ] ) , we see that the @xmath144 $ ] factors cancel .",
    "the second important implication of ( [ bouncezm ] ) is that the leading large @xmath141 behavior of @xmath145 is determined by the coefficient @xmath47 in ( [ backwardstart ] ) .",
    "since @xmath146 , the denominator in ( [ zeroremoved ] ) is & ~ & -2 r^3 ( ) ^ |_r = r ( ) + & & -8 , r. [ zmr ] thus we obtain the simple formula ( ) ^2 ( ) ^-1/2 = ^2 .",
    "[ zmf ] the final result ( [ zmformula ] ) follows by noting that @xmath147 may be expressed in terms of @xmath148 using the bounce differential equation ( [ bounceeq ] ) and the boundary condition ( [ bca ] ) .",
    "we stress that the final expression ( [ zmformula ] ) only requires knowing the two asymptotic constants , @xmath47 and @xmath148 , each of which is determined to great precision in the course of finding the classical bounce solution numerically , as described in section [ prefactor ] .      j.  s.  langer , `` theory of the condensation point , '' annals phys .   * 41 * , 108 ( 1967 ) ; `` statistical theory of the decay of metastable states , '' annals phys .   * 54 * , 258 ( 1969 ) .",
