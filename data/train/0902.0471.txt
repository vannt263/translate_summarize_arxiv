    "it is well known that grover s search algorithm for searching an item in a quantum data base of length @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the length of the quantum register made up of n - qubits , provides a quadratic speed up with respect any classical search algorithm  @xcite .",
    "some applications of this algorithm have already been done  @xcite , and its physical implementation has been made for few qubits  @xcite .",

    "this simulations use rf - pulses to implement quantum gates  @xcite , and the @xmath0-method  @xcite to control the non resonant transitions in the system . at the moment",
    ", there has not been a physical realization of this quantum computer . however , since the full hamiltonian can be explicitly written for this system , several useful analytical and numerical studies have been made  @xcite where the results can be extrapolated to other solid state spins quantum computers . on the other hand ,",
    "one important aspect of the simulation or implementation of a quantum algorithm is the effect that the noise can cause to the performance of this algorithm which may arise from error in the quantum parameters or from the interaction with the environment , or both .",
    "this noise may disrupt the algorithm ( decoherence ) and , eventually , destroy it .",
    "previous studies of the effect of noise on a realisation of grover s quantum search algorithm have been based on description in terms of abstract gates , which have been turned into noisy gates  @xcite and/or the introduction of dissipation and decoherence within the born - markov approximation  @xcite . by contrast , the present model is based on a definite quantum system , with a specific hamiltonian , where unitary errors and noise have a clear physical interpretation . in our model ,",
    "unitary errors arise from non - resonant transitions , whereas noise arises from fluctuations in the external fields  either the constant magnetic field or the radio - frequency pulses .    in a previous paper  @xcite , we studied unitary errors in the realisation of grover s quantum search algorithm on our quantum computer model .",

    "@xmath31 , this produces an equidistant spectrum ; for @xmath32 this guaranties a spectrum without any degeneracies .",
    "such a choice of the larmor frequencies would destroy the scalability of the present system as a model for quantum computation .    however , as it turns out degeneracies are not really a problem .",

    "but this can be savely avoided by choosing the spacing between neighboring larmor frequencies much larger than the coupling constants : @xmath43 .",

    "for our case , grover search algorithm  @xcite requieres three qubits to prepare the `` enquiry '' states and a single qubit ( `` ancilla '' ) required by the oracle to communicate its answer . starting from the ground state , @xmath50 , a superposition state with the qubits @xmath51",

    "the larmor frequencies @xmath6 for @xmath69 depend on a static magnetic field in @xmath70-direction with a strong field gradient : @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the strength of the static magnetic field at the location of the @xmath7th - paramagnetic nucleus of spin one - half .",

    "the environment or imperfections in the magnetic field produce noise which , in turn , will produce variations in the above parameters .",

    "this is @xmath9 the coupling between second nearest neighbors .",
    "besides the amplitude also the frequencies of the noise fluctuations are important .",
    "it makes a difference whether the variation of the larmor frequencies ( rabi frequency ) happen on a time scale which is of the order of the duration of the whole algorithm ( low frequency noise ) or of the duration of a single rf pulse . to investigate this issue",
    ", we consider two types of noise ( errors ) : _ static noise _ , where the respective frequencies are detuned for each realization , but kept fixed during the whole algorithm .",
    "_ random noise _ , where the respective frequencies are detuned anew for each rf - pulse .",

    "[ [ fidelity ] ] fidelity + + + + + + + +    in order to measure the effect of noise on the realisation of grover s quantum search algorithm , we use the fidelity ( or quantum loschmidt echo )  @xcite .",
    "we perform averages over @xmath88 repetitions ( where @xmath88 is of the order of 100 ) of the algorithm .",
    "this effectively turns the final state of the quantum computer into a mixed state @xmath89 .",
    "the fidelity is computed by projection of @xmath89 on the outcome of the ideal realisation of the algorithm : @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the final states obtained from the algorithm taking into account the random detuning of the respective frequencies .",
    "when analysing the final fidelity , there are two options : we can compare the final state after the evolution in the presence of noise and unwanted transitions with the final state obtained from an error - free execution of the quantum protocol , or we can compare the final state with the desired target state .",
    "these two options are not the same , because the grover protocol arrives at the desired target state only with a final probability , which is close to but still different from one  @xcite .",
    "both options yield very similar results for the behavior of fidelity . for the results presented in this paper , we chose the first option .",
    "we chose @xmath92 ( one order of magnitude smaller than the spacing between the larmor frequencies ) and @xmath93 ( one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath8 ) . in this way , made sure that the dominant source for errors were the near resonant transitions with detunings of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "these parameters are all frequencies  see eq .",
    "( [ a : defho ] )  given in units of @xmath94 .",
    "note however that since the model depends only on their relative values , we may also choose any other unit . unless stated otherwise , we choose the rabi frequency as @xmath95 according to the @xmath0-condition , such that near resonant transitions due to the second - neighbor coupling are efficiently suppressed .",
    "the evolution of the quantum state in the qubit - register is calculated numerically by solving the time - dependent schr \" odinger equation in the interaction picture .",
    "for that we have to solve a first order ordinary differential equation , where the state vector is represented by @xmath1 complex amplitudes . in view of the rapidly oscillating right hand side ( the interaction matrix ) ,",
    "any sophisticated adaptive stepsize routine is of limitted use .",
    "we therefore applied a simple 4th order runge - kutta algorithm to solve the differential equation , where we fixed the stepsize @xmath96 according to the largest larmor frequency @xmath97 which is the largest frequency in the problem : @xmath98 .",
    "the computation time depends mainly on the time needed to evaluate the right hand side of the differential equation .",
    "we have to calculate the components of an @xmath99-dimensional vector , and for each component we have to sum over the @xmath2 non - zero matrix elements of the interaction matrix .",
    "this means that the time needed for the evaluation of the right hand side scales as @xmath100 with the number of qubits .",
    "in addition , more qubits require a larger pulse sequence to apply the grover algorithm .",
    "ultimately , the length of the pulse sequence would scale with @xmath101 as explained for instance in ref .",
    "this would mean that overall , the computation time scales as @xmath102 .",
    "the simulation presented in this work are done on standard single processor machines . with our hardware",

    "thus , we normally set @xmath103 for the calculations with four qubits and in addition @xmath104 for the 5-qubit calculations .",
    "however , before settling for these values we compared the errors in different schemes ( exponential increase , avoiding any degeneracies in @xmath20 , quadratic increase , and the present linear increase ) .",

    "we expect the fit function eq  ( [ n : fit ] ) to work well .",
    "however in the case of static noise ( panel ( a ) ) we clearly need a different fit function to account for the apparently algebraic decay . in an attempt to maintain the general structure of the fit function as much as possible",
    ", we choose the new fit function of the form @xmath138 the following two tables contain the results of the fits for static and dynamic rabi frequency noise .    * static noise : for the fit function @xmath139 from eq .",
    "( [ n : fit2 ] ) one obtains the following fit values for the three cases considered : @xmath140 * dynamic noise : here , we use the same fit function @xmath141 from eq .",
    "( [ n : fit ] ) as in the case of larmor frequency noise , and we obtained the following fit values : @xmath142    the statistical uncertainties of the fit values are given in parenthesis .",
    "they refer to the last two digits of the respective fit value .",
    "finally , we may again ask which kind of noise , static or random , is leads to a larger loss of fidelity . while in fig .  [",
    "s : fig2 ] ( larmor frequency noise ) it was the random noise , here in fig .",
    "[ f : rabi ] the situation is more or less undecided .",
    "we note however that in the case of static noise ( panal ( a ) ) the different cases lead to a considerable spreading between the results in contrast to random noise ( panel ( b ) ) , where the corresponding curves are very close together .",
    "we may also note that the @xmath124-qubit case in panel ( a ) shows initially the fastest drop in fidelity .",
    "it therefore has the correct tendency if we believe that for more qubits and more grover steps , the static errors should lead to lower fidelities  @xcite .",
    "using the near resonant approximation , the numerical studies on rabi frequency noise can be performed very efficiently .",
    "this would allow us to consider the grover search algorithm in a larger quantum register with more qubits .",
    "we would need longer pulse sequences and more complex gate sequences for the implementation of the oracle .",
    "however , the main obstacle in considering more qubits are the unitary errors of our pulse sequence . without additional error reduction ( _ e.g. _ along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the unitary errors alone would already reduce the final fidelity @xmath126 so much that the effects of additional noise could not be analysed .",
    "we studied the effect of noise on the performance of grover s search algorithm implemented on a nuclear spin quantum computer with four spins coupled via first- and second - neighbor ising interactions .",
    "starting from the ground state , the quantum search algorithm attempts to build - up the target state in the quantum register , using the information obtained from inquieries of a quantum oracle .",
    "we used the fidelity to quantify the effect of noise on the final state , _",
    "i.e. _ the result of the algorithm .",
    "we considered different types of noise : ( i ) noise affecting the larmor frequencies which would be due to fluctuations in the static magnetic field , and ( ii ) noise affecting the rabi frequency , which would be due to fluctuations in the intensity of the radio - frequency pulses .",
    "we simulate the noise by randomly detuning the respective frequencies from their nominal values . for both cases ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) we considered two types of noise , systematic and random errors . in the case of systematic errors , the resepective frequencies are randomly chosen at the beginning of the algorithm and then kept fixed during the whole protocol .",
    "by contrast , in the case of random errors , the respective frequencies are randomly chosen for each radiofrequency pulse .",
    "we found that the threshold of this amplitude for still having good performance of the algorithm is @xmath143 for larmor - frequency noise and @xmath144 for systematic error on rabi - frequency .we also found that this algorithm is much more sensitive to systematic errors than random errors which behave like an exponential and gaussian decay respectively .",
    "one may say that this gaussian behavior corresponds to the robustness of the algorithm . as we mentioned before",
    ", computing time increases very much with the number of qubits , making the increasing of the number of grover steps not feasible within our model ."
