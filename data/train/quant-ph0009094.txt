    "at the moment , the most popular model of a quantum computer consists of the @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 of ` @xmath0 qubits ' as its memory space , and some one- and two - qubit gates as its set of basic transformations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are several reasons for taking one- and two - qubit gates as the basic ones : firstly , from the pure mathematical point of view , it is quite natural to look for a subset of the lie group of unitary transformations on the hilbert space @xmath3 generating the whole group .",
    "obviously , one - qubit operations do not generate the whole lie group , the set of two - qubit gates does @xcite .",
    "hence there is no reason for taking more complicated transformations like three - qubit unitary operators as basic ones .",
    "secondly , the model of two - qubit gates might be considered as the attempt to develop quantum computation in strong analogy to the theory of classical devices : building complex logical networks from two - bit gates is a successful concept of classical computation .",
    "the third reason stems from physics .",
    "unfortunately it is only ` a little bit ' convincing : from the fundamental point of view , @xmath0 particles interact always in the form of pair - interactions , i.e. , the total hamiltonian @xmath4 of the system can be decomposed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a self - adjoint operator acting on the joint hilbert space of particle @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the free hamiltonian of particle @xmath10 ( without loss of generality , we can drop the second sum , by reckoning it to the first part ) .",
    "pair - interactions @xmath6 are the infinitesimal versions of two - qubit gates : every unitary of the form @xmath11 for @xmath12 is a two - qubit gate . on the one hand",
    ", this seems to be an important justification for two - qubit gates , since it refers to the form of the fundamental forces of nature , on the other hand , the argument is not really correct : in general there is no obvious correspondence between the time evolution @xmath13 and any finite sequence of two - qubit gates .",
    "however , there is an obvious simulation by two - qubit gates in an _ approximative _ sense given by the well - known trotter formula : @xmath14 this example shows , that the simulation of the time evolution caused by a time - independent pair - interaction hamiltonian might require an _",
    "infinite _ number of two qubit gates .",
    "hence it seems to suggest that a definition of complexity based on two - qubit gates does _ not _ take into account the most natural form of dynamics of many - particle quantum physics .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that the number @xmath15 of gates required to simulate the right hand side of ( [ trotter ] ) up to an error @xmath16 is only growing with @xmath17 . despite the fact that infinite accuracy requires",
    "an infinite number of gates , the _ time _ for implementing the growing number of unitaries does not tend to infinity if one assumes that the implementation of @xmath18 requires the time @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) . taking this assumption",
    ", we will show that the running time of a discrete quantum algorithm for simulating the dynamics given by ( [ stetig ] ) is determined by the chromatic index of the interaction graph .",
    "this turns out to be true even for time - dependent pair - interactions .",
    "one might reformulate this result by saying that the running time depends on ` the complexity of the interaction ' .",
    "the relevance of this result is twofold : in case realizations of future quantum computers are based on two - qubit gates , it gives exact statements about the complexity of simulating non - autonomous quantum dynamics resulting from pair - interaction hamiltonians . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first exact analogue between complexity measures of discrete and continuous quantum algorithms .",
    "secondly , our result is relevant for the simulation of arbitrary pair - interaction dynamics by a dynamic with restricted interaction graph : we derive statements about the efficiency for simulating time evolutions based on pair - interactions with _ high chromatic index _ by other evolutions with interactions of _ lower index_.",
    "in our model of discrete quantum computers , two - qubit gates acting on disjoint pairs of qubits can be implemented simultaneously .",
    "we define :    a * discrete quantum algorithm * @xmath20 * of depth * @xmath7 is a sequence of @xmath7 steps @xmath21 where every step consists of a set of two qubit gates @xmath22 acting on disjoint pairs @xmath23 of qubits .",
    "every step @xmath24 defines a unitary operator @xmath25 by taking the product of all corresponding unitaries in any order .",
    "the product @xmath26 is the ` unitary operator implemented by @xmath20 ' .",
    "the following quantity measures the deviation of a unitary operator from the identity :    the * angle * of an arbitrary unitary operator @xmath27 is the smallest possible norm denotes the operator norm given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 runs over the unit vectors of the corresponding hilbert space . ] @xmath30 of a selfadjoint operator @xmath31 which satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "it coincides with the time required for the implementation of @xmath27 if the norm of the used hamiltonian is 1 .",
    "this term allows us to formulate a modification of the term ` depth ' which will later turn out to be decisive in connecting complexity measures of discrete and continuous algorithms :    let @xmath33 be the maximal angle of the unitaries performed in step @xmath24 .",
    "then the * weighted depth * is defined to be the sum @xmath34 .",
    "assuming that the implementation time of a unitary is proportional to its angle , the weighted depth is the running time of the algorithm .",
    "since this coincidence is based on a possibly unrealistic assumption we will prefer the term ` weighted depth ' in formulating exact mathematical statements .",
    "now we want to formalize the notion of quantum algorithms based on time dependent hamiltonians .",
    "such continuous algorithms have already been considered in the literature ( e.g. see @xcite ) , but in our approach the hamiltonians are explicitly restricted to pair - interactions in many - particle systems :    [ calg ] a * continuous quantum algorithm @xmath20 of running time * @xmath35 is a piecewise lipschitz continuous function @xmath36 from the interval @xmath37 $ ] into the set of those self - adjoint operators acting on @xmath3 which can be decomposed into @xmath38 where every @xmath6 is a self - adjoint operator acting on the qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath39 and the sum runs over the unordered pairs .",
    "we say ` @xmath20 implements @xmath27 ' if @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the solution of the non - autonomous differential equation @xmath42 with @xmath43 .    as already mentioned above",
    ", the weighted depth of a discrete algorithm for simulating the evolution ( [ stetig ] ) is finite .",
    "more precisely , it is at most @xmath44 if @xmath15 is the number of pairs @xmath45 with the property that @xmath46 .",
    "but , if one has additional information about the interactions , one can make further statements about possible parallelization .",
    "this is illustrated by the following examples : in case all the pairs @xmath45 with @xmath46 are disjoint , we can perform all the unitaries @xmath18 simultaneously and get the running time @xmath47 . in case of the nearest - neighbor interaction in a one dimensional spin chain",
    ", we have only pairs of the form @xmath48 .",
    "hence we can perform all the transformations @xmath49 simultaneously and the operations @xmath50 as well .",
    "here , parallelization allows to decrease the running time down to @xmath51 .",
    "we show that the graph theoretical concept of chromatic index offers the appropriate terminology for determining the degree of possible parallelization .",
    "@xcite[chr ] the * chromatic index * of a graph with vertices @xmath52 is the least number of colors required for coloring the edges in such a way that there are no edges with the same color having a common vertex .    for every time @xmath47 during the running time of the continuous algorithm we define a family of undirected graphs :    for every non - negative real number @xmath53 and every time @xmath54 $ ] we define the * interaction graph * @xmath55 as follows : take the qubits @xmath52 as vertices and let the edges be all the pairs @xmath45 with the property @xmath56 .",
    "the following quantity turns out to be decisive for the degree of possible parallelization of the discrete simulation :    let @xmath57 be the chromatic index of @xmath55 .",
    "for any time @xmath54 $ ] of a continuous algorithm we define the * weighted chromatic index * @xmath58 as @xmath59    furthermore we will need the time integral of @xmath60 :    the * integrated chromatic index * of the quantum algorithm is defined to be @xmath61 where @xmath35 is the running time of the continuous algorithm .",
    "actually , the terminology ` integrated weighted chromatic index ' would be appropriate .",
    "we preferred the short terminology .",
    "the following theorem suggests that the simulation of an interaction with high integrated chromatic index generically requires a discrete algorithm with high weighted depth .",
    "more precisely , it shows that the complexity of a unitary transformation can equivalently be defined as the infimum over the values of the weighted depth of all possible discrete implementations or the infimum over the values of the integrated chromatic index of all possible continuous implementations :    [ haupt ]    \\a ) every arbitrary unitary operator @xmath27 acting on n qubits which can be implemented by a discrete quantum algorithm with weighted depth @xmath62 can also be implemented by a continuous quantum algorithm with integrated chromatic index @xmath62 .",
    "\\b ) if there is a continuous algorithm with integrated chromatic index @xmath62 implementing @xmath27 then there is a sequence of discrete algorithms @xmath63 implementing the unitaries @xmath64 such that @xmath65 and the corresponding values of the weighted depth converge to @xmath62 .",
    "statement a ) is almost trivial : let @xmath20 be a discrete quantum algorithm of depth @xmath7 with the maximal angles @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the set of qubit pairs which are addressed in the step @xmath10 and @xmath68 the corresponding set of unitary transformations .",
    "define a continuous algorithm with running time @xmath7 as follows : for @xmath69 we define the constant hamiltonian @xmath70 . since the angle of a unitary operator @xmath27 is the norm of @xmath71",
    ", we have @xmath72 .",
    "hence , for every @xmath47 in the interval @xmath73 we have @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 otherwise .",
    "obviously we have @xmath77    for statement b ) take a partition of @xmath37 $ ] into small intervals on which @xmath4 is continuous .",
    "let @xmath78 be one of those intervals .",
    "let @xmath79 be the positive numbers @xmath80 in its canonical ordering .",
    "furthermore define @xmath81 .",
    "obviously , the function @xmath82 takes constant values @xmath83 on every interval @xmath84r_{j-1},r_{j}]$ ] for @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 be a partition of the set of edges of @xmath87 given by an allowed coloring ( in the sense of definition [ chr ] ) of the edges corresponding to the chromatic index @xmath83 .",
    "for every @xmath88 we proceed as follows : for every @xmath89 define a step of a discrete algorithm by the set of unitaries @xmath90 since @xmath91 runs from @xmath92 to @xmath83 we obtain @xmath83 steps for the discrete algorithm .",
    "every step has at most the angle @xmath93 .",
    "the weighted depth of these @xmath83 steps is at most @xmath94 .",
    "doing this for every @xmath88 , we obtain a sequence of @xmath95 steps which substitutes the continuous algorithm on the interval @xmath78 up to an error in the order of @xmath96 . the weighted depth of this sequence is at most @xmath97 without loss of generality we will assume the weighted depth to be _ equal _ to the terms in equation ( [ weighted ] ) since we can blow up the algorithm by transformations which cancel each other out . if the total discrete algorithm is defined by combining the sequences for every interval of the form @xmath98 we get a simulation of the continuous algorithm with an error in the order of @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore the total weighted depth converges to @xmath99 for @xmath100",
    ".    one can consider discrete quantum algorithms as special cases of continuous quantum algorithms in the sense of the proof of part a ) of theorem [ haupt ] .",
    "then the discrete quantum computer is obtained by restricting the hamiltonians @xmath101 to those with chromatic index one and norm one for each non - vanishing component @xmath102 . in this sense ,",
    "part a ) of theorem [ haupt ] is a special case of the general principle that continuous time algorithms can be simulated by other continuous time algorithms with lower chromatic indices and the same strength of the pair - interactions where the running time is increased by the quotient of the chromatic indices .",
    "we sketch this simple observation in a not too formal way :    at time @xmath47 we have the interaction @xmath103 where @xmath23 runs over the edges @xmath104 of the graph @xmath105 . for @xmath106 take @xmath7 such that @xmath107 .",
    "take a partition of the edges of @xmath105 into @xmath7 subsets such that the subgraphs with the set of edges @xmath108 have chromatic indices less or equal to @xmath15 .",
    "substitute the small time interval @xmath78 of the original algorithm by the @xmath7 time intervals @xmath109 with @xmath110 in which the hamiltonian @xmath111 is switched on .",
    "the difference of the unitary operators implemented by the substituted algorithm and the original one is of second order in @xmath16 for every subinterval .",
    "hence the total error tends to zero for @xmath112 .",
    "this observation justifies in some sense our point of view that one might think of the chromatic index as the complexity of the interaction .",
    "this raises the question whether bounds can be given on the required integrated chromatic index necessary for preparing certain entangled quantum states from an initial product state .",
    "in @xcite we gave lower bounds on the depth required for preparing certain states with large - scale entanglement ( some of those bounds are easy conclusions from @xcite ) for large qubit numbers @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , one can show the following : let @xmath113 be a family of arbitrary self - adjoint operators where every @xmath114 acts on qubit @xmath10 and has operator norm 1 . for product states ,",
    "the variance of the observable @xmath115 grows with @xmath116 .",
    "values of the variance in the order of @xmath117 indicate large - scale entanglement for pure states @xcite . in a state obtained by a discrete algorithm with depth",
    "@xmath7 we could show @xcite the variance to be less or equal to @xmath118 .",
    "hence the emergence of large - scale entanglement in the sense described above requires a depth in the order of @xmath119 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether similar bounds can be shown for the _ weighted _ depth and the integrated chromatic index .",
    "however , below we present a proof for such a bound .",
    "in contrast to the discrete definition of depth the bound is asymptotically independent on @xmath0 in the limit @xmath120 . whether this is a lack of our estimations or whether it is a hint for a fundamental difference between complexity measures of continuous and discrete algorithms is unclear .",
    "we have :    [ entan ] let @xmath121 be a continuous quantum algorithm with integrated chromatic index @xmath62 implementing the unitary @xmath27 .",
    "let the quantum computer start in the product state @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath123 be the state obtained by the algorithm .",
    "then for the variance of any observable @xmath31 of the form ( [ meanfield ] ) in the state @xmath124 we have @xmath125 with @xmath126    due to theorem [ haupt ] we can restrict the proof to the case that @xmath4 is of the same form as that one constructed in the proof of theorem [ haupt ] a ) , i.e. , @xmath101 is for every @xmath47 a sum of pair - interactions acting on disjoint pairs .",
    "furthermore we will assume without loss of generality that the norm of every non - vanishing pair - interaction is one .",
    "then @xmath62 coincides with the running time @xmath35 .",

    "for every @xmath168 with @xmath154 we have at most @xmath136 elements of the form @xmath167 since for each vertex @xmath181 there can be at most one @xmath182 such that @xmath170 has @xmath183 as a vertex ( remember that the corresponding graph @xmath184 has chromatic index 1 ) . if @xmath185 the statement @xmath186 can only be true if @xmath187 .",

    "since the norm of every @xmath192 is zero or one by assumption , the norm of @xmath193 can never exceed @xmath194 .",
    "hence we get @xmath195 since the integration is carried out over a simplex of size @xmath196 we obtain : @xmath197 this power series converges for @xmath198 .",
    "since @xmath199 we have : @xmath200    theorem [ entan ] shows that for huge @xmath0 the variance of the measurement results of any mean - field observable can only grow in the order of @xmath117 if the integrated chromatic index @xmath62 is at least @xmath201 .",
    "hence @xmath202 is a necessary condition for the particular class of large - scale entangled states considered in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the running time of a discrete algorithm simulating the evolution defined by a time - dependent schrdinger - equation with pair - interaction hamiltonians is given by the time integral over the chromatic index of the interaction graph .",
    "this result suggests to take this time integral as a complexity measure for continuous time algorithms and it seems natural to ask for the complexity for the preparation of highly entangled states in many - particle systems .",
