    "the distance from the sun to the galactic center , @xmath0 , provides the basic calibration for a wide range of methods used for distance determination , both on galactic and extragalactic scales .",
    "calculations of many physical parameters , including of the distances , masses , and luminosities of galactic objects , as well as the galaxy s integrated mass and luminosity , depend directly on @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , most luminosity and a large number of mass estimators scale as distance squared , while masses based on total densities or orbital modeling scale as distance cubed .",
    "this dependence could involve adoption of a galactic mass and/or rotation model , in which case we also need to know the sun s circular velocity accurately .",
    "as @xmath0 estimates are refined , so are the estimated distances , masses , and luminosities of numerous galactic and extragalactic objects , as well as our best estimates of the rate of galactic rotation and the size of the milky way . in addition , a highly accurate direct galactic center distance determination would immediately allow reliable recalibration of the zero points of numerous secondary distance calibrators , including of cepheids , rr lyrae , and mira variable stars , which would consequently reinforce the validity of the extragalactic distance scale ( e.g. , olling 2007 ) . in turn",
    ", this would enable better estimates of globular cluster ages , the hubble constant , as well as a lower limit to the age of the universe ( monelli et al .",
    "2015 ) , and place tighter constraints on a range of cosmological scenarios ( e.g. , reid et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "it is no surprise , therefore , that determinations of the galactic center distance have been the subject of many studies ever since the first attempt by harlow shapley in 19141918 .",
    "however , the importance of determining an accurate @xmath0 value , combined with the large number of studies undertaken to achieve this goal , have led to speculations that some degree of publication bias ( also known as ` observation bias ' or a ` bandwagon effect ' ) may have affected subsequent galactic center distance determinations ( e.g. , reid 1989 , 1993 ; nikiforov 2004 ; foster & cooper 2010 ; malkin 2013a , b ; francis & anderson 2014 ) .    in de grijs et al .",
    "( 2014 , henceforth paper i ) , de grijs & bono ( 2014 ; paper ii ) , and de grijs & bono ( 2015 ; paper iii ) , we embarked on large - scale data mining of the nasa / astrophysics data system ( ads ) to explore whether distance determinations to , respectively the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the m31 group , and the small magellanic cloud had been polluted by such bandwagon effects . in this paper , we extend our series of papers by adding a similar analysis of distance estimates to the galactic center . our ultimate aim is to provide a self - consistent distance framework that can serve as a benchmark for the structure of the local group of galaxies ( see , e.g. , table 4 in paper ii , combined with the recommended distance to the small magellanic cloud from paper iii ) .    to achieve our aim , in section 2",
    "we discuss our approach to mining the nasa / ads database , eventually resulting in the most complete and most comprehensive database of galactic center distances published , starting from shapley s ( 1918 ) distance estimate , published in october 1918 , until early june 2016 . in section 3 ,",
    "we review three different types of galactic center distance indicators , including direct distance measurements as well as centroid- and kinematics - based galactic center distance determinations .",
    "this is followed in section 4 by a detailed discussion of the validity of and the uncertainties affecting the ` best ' measurements , which we also place in the context of the most recent progress in the field .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes and concludes the paper .",
    "the distance to the galactic center has long been a subject of intense scrutiny . since the mid-1970s",
    ", it has become standard practice in meta - analyses of the galactic center distance to publish compilations of previously published values ( e.g. , harris 1976 ; de vaucouleurs 1983 ; kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ; reid 1993 ; nikiforov 2004 ; perryman 2009 , his table 9.1 ; malkin 2013a , b ) .",
    "although the latest such compilation dates only from 2013 , upon close examination it transpired that malkin s ( 2013a , b ) compilation of 53 galactic center distance estimates published between 1992 and 2011 is incomplete : our own perusal of the literature from this same period revealed an additional 32 papers with newly derived or updated galactic center distance estimates .",
    "since gaps in the data may mask or , alternatively , artificially suggest the presence of publication bias ( for a discussion , see paper i ) , we decided to compile our own database of galactic center distances that is as complete as possible until the present time .",
    "we followed a similar two - pronged approach as employed in papers i , ii , and iii .",
    "first , we scanned all 23,516 papers until and including february 2016 tagged with the ` galactic center ' keyword in the nasa / ads for potential new or rederived galactic center distance determinations . at the same time",
    ", we carefully followed the reference trail : where a paper referred to the provenance of the galactic center distance adopted by its authors , we made a note of the original reference and double checked that the latter was actually included in our final database .",
    "this approach led to a final database containing a total of 273 galactic center distance measurements since shapley s ( 1918 ) first attempt at determining the centroid of the galaxtic globular cluster distribution known at that time .",
    "as for papers i  iii , the full database is available at http://astro-expat.info/data/pubbias.html , where we provide our compilation of galactic center distances both as a function of publication date and by tracer , supported by full bibliographic information .",
    "we compiled the extinction - corrected distance moduli , as well as their statistical and systematic uncertainties , if available .",
    "only 25 authors published their systematic uncertainties separately ; in addition , five papers specified that their published error bars include the systematic uncertainties . for the remaining galactic center distance measurements ,",
    "the uncertainties refer to the statistical errors only . as in papers",
    "i  iii , instead of combining individual values based on different assumptions or input parameters , we have included all ( final ) galactic center distance measurements published in a given paper .",
    "the range spanned by such alternative values provides a valuable estimate of the systematic uncertainty inherent to the distance determined , although we note that these values are often highly correlated .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an overview of the data as published in the original articles , i.e. , without having homogenized or recalibrated the various measurements .",
    "we show both the full data set in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a and subsets selected according to their provenance , i.e. , direct measurements ( statistical parallaxes , galactic center orbital modeling , galactic center cepheids ) , centroid determinations ( @xmath6 scuti , rr lyrae , cepheids , and mira variables , red clump stars ) , and determinations involving adoption of a kinematic disk model ( cepheids , rr lyrae , miras , open clusters ) .",
    "we have also included the galactic center distance values recommended by the international astronomical union ( iau ) . at its xii@xmath7 general assembly held in hamburg ( germany ) in 1964 , the iau released its first formal recommendation for the value of @xmath8 kpc .",
    "this was subsequently amended to @xmath9 kpc ( kerr & lynden - bell 1986 ) , a value that has been in force since 1986 . nevertheless , even a casual comparison of the galactic center distances in our database ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) with the current iau recommendation reveals that the latter value is well above the mean of most current and recent determinations of @xmath0 . as such",
    ", the community has called for a further adjustment of the iau recommendation , but this would need to be done in tandem with adjustments of the galactic rotation rate at the solar circle as well as of the oort constants , which all depend on one another .",
    "our final database is significantly more comprehensive than any previously published compilation of galactic center distance estimates .",
    "we will demonstrate this by comparison of our data set with those of three benchmark papers , kerr & lynden - bell ( 1986 ) , reid et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and malkin ( 2013a ) .",
    "the latter paper was selected for this comparison since it is the most recent large compilation .",
    "as already addressed earlier in this section , we added 32 papers ( containing 42 new galactic center distance estimates ) to malkin s ( 2013a ) compilation of 53 articles published between 1992 may and 2011 july .",
    "the review by reid ( 1993 ) has long been used as the ` gold standard ' in the field of galactic center distance determinations .",
    "it includes 37 @xmath0 values published between 1972 june and 1992 april , taken from 38 articles .",
    "our compilation , by contrast , includes 20 additional galactic center distance estimate , found in 17 papers not included by reid ( 1993 ) . finally , the current iau recommendation for the value of @xmath0 is based on the compilation of 26 estimates by kerr & lynden - bell ( 1986 ) . again",
    ", our own perusal of the literature published in the period spanning from 1973 august to 1986 may revealed nine additional galactic center distance determinations .",
    "based on observations taken since 1914 , shapley ( 1918 ) used the light curves and , hence , the period  luminosity relation of cepheid variables in 69 galactic globular clusters to visualize the spatial distribution of the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "he eventually extended his analysis to include all 93 galactic globular clusters known at that time .",
    "he subsequently determined the centroid of the three - dimensional globular cluster distribution to determine the first ever distance to the galactic center , @xmath10 kpc .",
    "armed with our current understanding of the structure of the milky way , it is clear that this distance estimate was considerably too large .",
    "in fact , the period ",
    "luminosity relation he applied was @xmath111 mag too faint , while he used population ii cepheids ( w virginis stars)combined with the 25 brightest stars in his seven sample clusters ( since population ii cepheids were only known in a limited number of clusters)instead of the population i cepheids he thought he had observed .",
    "population ii cepheids are some 2 mag fainter than their population i counterparts , while it appears that shapley ( 1918 ) may also have made calibration errors regarding the absolute magnitudes of the brightest stars and the associated reddening corrections ( sandage 2004 , pp .",
    "301302 ) , thus offsetting the error introduced by his use of an incorrect period ",
    "luminosity relation to some extent . as a consequence , shapley s ( 1918 )",
    "distance scale was off by @xmath111 mag , corresponding to a factor of @xmath111.6 .",
    "note that the implicatiom of shapley s ( 1918 ) results based on his approach of using both population ii cepheids and his clusters brightest stars may suggest that the difference between classical and population ii cepheids only applies to a limited number of clusters .",
    "while shapley s ( 1918 ) galactic center distance determination now seems a mere historical curiosity , the fact remains that this was the first viable ` centroid ' approach to estimate the galactic center s distance .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to compare shapley s ( 1918 ) result with the most recent @xmath0 determination based on the globular cluster centroid .",
    "nikiforov & smirnova ( 2013 ) found that the globular clusters composing the galaxy s metal - rich and metal - poor subsystems separately form bar - like structures that closely resemble the galactic bar as a whole .",
    "they conclude that only non - axisymmetric models can provide sufficiently strong constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , these authors found evidence for an extinction component associated with the galactic bar which affects the observational incompleteness of globular clusterss on the far side of the galactic center , a selection effect that must be considered seriously in determining @xmath0 .    in this section , we will focus on the ` modern ' period since 1990 to distinguish among three different types of galactic center distance determinations in order of decreasing accuracy , i.e. , direct ( geometric ) methods , centroid - based methods , and distance determinations based on observations of tracer objects at some distance from the galactic center , combined with a kinematic model of the galactic disk .",
    "we will also address the uncertainties inherent to each of the methods applied .",
    "the current - best , ` direct ' ( geometric ) estimates of @xmath0 are based on astrometric orbit determinations of the so - called s stars in the galactic center region .",
    "two competing groups are leading efforts in this field , i.e. , genzel et al . versus ghez and collaborators",
    ": see table [ gcdirect.tab ] .",
    "figure [ fig1]b shows the run of these determinations as a function of publication date ( black points ) .",
    "the latest result from the genzel group is @xmath12 kpc ( gillessen et al .",
    "2013 ) , while the ghez group published @xmath13 kpc ( yelda et al . 2011",
    "; but see morris et al .",
    "2012 for a rather surprising downgrade ) .",
    "we will return to a discussion of these direct measurements in section [ discussion.sec ] .",
    "the next best direct galactic center estimates come from statistical parallax measurements of the nuclear star cluster .",
    "these measurements are also included in table [ gcdirect.tab ] .",
    "taking the straight mean and standard deviation of all such measurements gives @xmath14 kpc .",
    "however , this approach does not do full justice to the published results .",
    "systematic uncertainties related to the dynamical cluster models affect the resulting distance determinations .",
    "assuming uniform , isotropic , and fully phase - mixed systems ( e.g. , eisenhauer et al . 2003 ; do et al .",
    "2013 ) seems to yield systematically smaller @xmath0 values than adopting anisotropic , spherical jeans models ( e.g. , do et al .",
    "the current - best results are based on joined - up analyses of both the nuclear star cluster s stellar velocity dispersions and s - star orbital modeling .",
    "the latter lead to @xmath15 kpc ( do et al .",

    "suggests that any differences are negligible . ]",
    "if this small distance differential between the nuclear cepheids and the actual galactic center is real , this may imply that the former objects are seen in projection onto the galactic center .",
    "in fact , matsunaga et al .",
    "( 2011 ) do not claim precise coincidence with the galactic center , but merely that their projected positions are consistent with their presence in the thin disk - like structure of the nuclear bulge .",
    "these authors point out that their mean distance estimate suffers from an additional , systematic uncertainty of approximately 0.3 kpc , which is predominantly driven by the uncertainties inherent to the extinction law applied ( i.e. , the total - to - selective extinction ratio ) and by scatter among the prevailing period ",

    "this is indeed consistent with their earlier suggestion .",
    "finally , we note that some authors have suggested that the distances to different galactic center tracers affected by significant extinction should be adjusted upward , for instance by adopting a non - standard or variable extinction law toward the galactic center ( e.g. , collinge et al . 2006 ; vanhollebeke et al . 2009 ; pietrukowicz et al . 2012 ; nataf et al . 2013 ; nataf et al . 2016",
    "; but see francis & anderson 2014 ) .",
    "in addition , the effects of population differences ( ages and metallicities ) may cause certain tracer objects  such as red clump stars  to be redder in the galactic bulge than their solar neighborhood equivalents ( e.g. , girardi & salaris 2001 ) , which thus implies that significant systematic uncertainties likely remain in the zero - point calibrations of many ` standard ' secondary distance tracers .      since the pioneering effort by shapley ( 1918 )",
    ", many authors have attempted to determine @xmath0 based on the centroids of the distributions of a variety of tracers , including globular clusters , cepheid , rr lyrae , and mira variables , red clumps stars , and even delta scuti stars and planetary nebulae .    while fig .",

    "such behavior may lead to a ` bandwagon effect , ' more commonly referred to as publication bias ( for background , see paper i ) .    in the context of galactic center distance determinations ,",

    "the underlying assumption of keplerian motion of the s stars around sgr a*. first , newton s shell theorem , which posits that the gravity inside a spherical shell is unimportant , provides only an approximate solution to characterize the real , three - dimensional distribution of matter in the nuclear disk and central bar of the milky way .",

    "( 2009 ) are based on the assumption that this precession arises in the schwarzschild metric , whereas one should instead adopt the kerr metric associated with a relativistically rotating central black hole . in turn",
    ", this leads to ` frame dragging ' ( also known as the lense  thirring effect ) , which is predicted to affect both the s stars orbits and the light paths into the line of sight .",
    "neither zucker et al . ( 2006 ) nor gillessen et al . (",
    "2009 ) considered these effects ( for a detailed discussion , see francis & anderson 2014 ) . yet , in 2002 , when the star s2 was near its pericenter and relativistic effects were most significant , both zucker et al .",

    "( 2009 ) point out that their new values for @xmath0 are consistent within the errors with the eisenhauer et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) results , and that adding more stars to the orbital solutions does not change the results significantly .",
    "they assert that their main improvement is owing to the more rigorous treatment of the systematic errors .",
    "in fact , it appears that this change is indeed not driven by publication bias , nor did their consideration of relativistic effects have a significant impact .",
    "the latter statement is supported by comparing the zucker et al .",
    "( 2006 ) galactic center distance estimate with the earlier determinations of eisenhauer et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) . instead , the gillessen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) galactic center distance is more robust than their previous results , given that it is based on astrometric observations of much higher quality ( affected by smaller astrometric uncertainties ) and covering a significantly longer time span .    the latest results obtained by both genzel s group ( gillessen et al .",
    "2009 , 2013 ) and ghez collaboration ( ghez et al . 2008 ; yelda et al .",
    "2011 ) are indeed fully mutually consistent , as also expected from the @xmath0 values resulting from combining the data of both groups ( gillessen et al .",
    "2009 ) . indeed , the low value of @xmath277 kpc derived by morris et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , members of the ghez group , is an odd one out .",
    "these latter authors only commented that this estimate corresponds to their current best fit to the observational data from 19952011 .",
    "they did not discuss their discrepant result , other than by pointing out that the uncertainty in their estimate is highly correlated with the uncertainty in the mass of the black hole .",
    "indeed , the same degeneracy affects the central values ( e.g. , gillessen et al .",
    "2009 ) . in conclusion",
    ", we have not unearthed any evidence of possible publication bias in the galactic center distances resulting from s - star orbital modeling .",
    "careful assessment of the @xmath0 values obtained from statistical parallax measurements of the nuclear star cluster also show broad consistency during the 20 years leading up to 2015 ( for a brief discussion , see section [ direct.sec ] ) .",
    "therefore , the current - best distance determination to the galactic center is , arguably , based on appropriate combined direct observations of both the s - star orbits and the galactic center s statistical parallax properties .",
    "( 2013 ) and chatzopoulos et al .",
    "( 2015 ) both attempted such a combination , yielding @xmath278 kpc and @xmath279 kpc , respectively .",
    "however , other recent direct galactic center distance measurements yield somewhat smaller distances ( e.g. , trippe et al . 2008 , 2011 ;",
    "yelda et al .",
    "2011 ; gillessen et al . 2013 ) .",
    "at the present time , we therefore advocate a benchmark galactic center distance of @xmath280 kpc , where the uncertainty is the statistical error resulting from combination of the do et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and chatzopoulos et al .",
    "( 2015 ) ` combined ' values .",
    "the additional , systematic uncertainty , which should be added in quadrature , is of order @xmath281 kpc .",
    "the latter estimate follows from consideration of the full set of updated values of @xmath0 in table [ gcdirect.tab ] , where the variety of assumptions made is reflected in the spread of the central values ( see also the discussion in section [ direct.sec ] ) .",
    "the unprecedented volume of our catalog of galactic center distance determinations has allowed us to conclude that the globular cluster , cepheid , and red clump centroids suggest smaller galactic center distances than the direct distances estimates , while the rr lyrae and mira variables result in larger galactic center centroid distances ( see , e.g. , table [ gccentroids.tab ] ) .    indeed , it has been suggested that some tracers , and in particular the ( @xmath282 gyr ) old tracers ( i.e. , the rr lyrae stars ) might or might not follow the galactic bar ( e.g. , zoccali & valenti 2016 ) .",
    "this implies that distance determinations based on these tracers might depend on the line of sight of the adopted sample .",
    "moreover , we do not yet have similarly robust identifications of rr lyrae stars located in the galactic center center as we do for the galactic center cepheid sample .",
    "this suggests that rr lyrae variables might be more prone to possible systematic effects ( e.g. , zoccali & valenti 2016 ) .",
    "in addition , there are reasons to believe that the red clump results might also be affected by large systematic uncertainties . in fact , if a metallicity gradient is present from the galactic center to the outer bulge ( e.g. , zoccali et al .",
    "2008 ; pietrukowicz et al .",
    "2012 , 2015 ; uttenthaler et al .",
    "2012 ) , this also means that the mean magnitude and color of red clump stars change when approaching the galaxy s inner core .",
    "a separate concern regarding systematic effects introduced by our homogenization is the following .",
    "if , as we have done for many rr lyrae - based galactic center distance determinations , we adopt any of the prevailing @xmath283 versus [ fe / h ] relations , we have to deal with a strong dependence on the reddening correction and the metallicity distribution of rr lyrae in the central galaxy .",
    "specifically , we have adopted @xmath104 mag . if the original papers quoting galactic center distance determinations used any other absolute magnitude calibration ( see table [ gccentroids.tab ] ) , we converted the @xmath0 value to a distance modulus , corrected it for the difference in calibration used , and eventually converted it back to a linear distance . if we were to adopt the @xmath50-band magnitudes for our calibration instead",
    ", the dependence on metallicity and on the reddening uncertainties is smaller .",
    "however , in this case we would introduce a dependence on the pulsation period , since rr lyrae exhibiting longer periods are brighter .",
    "where appropriate , we have also assumed that @xmath57 } = -1.0 $ ] dex for rr lyrae in the bulge ( e.g. , bono et al .",
    "if we assume that a typical mean period for a fundamental rr lyrae in the bulge is around 0.550.60 days and the mean metallicity is around [ fe / h]@xmath284 , @xmath285 mag ( marconi et al . 2015 ) . at the present time , we have access to too few @xmath50-band calibrated rr lyrae distance measurements to the galactic center ( only two such calibrations are available : carney et al .",
    "1995 ; dambis 2009 ) .",
    "overall , the adjustments thus made take into account the metallicity dependence of the rr lyrae distance scale to the best of our current ability .    finally , we explored whether any of the centroid tacers or those used for the kinematics - based galactic center distance estimates exhibited statistically significant trends in the modern , post-1990 era . in the context of exploring possible bandwagon effects ,",
    "one should , of course , only consider the _ original _ galactic center distance estimates , before homogenization .",
    "the significant scatter among the data points pertaining to any of the kinematics tracers precludes us from resolving any such trend . among the centroid tracers",
    ", we do not have sufficient numbers of data points for the globular clusters , planetary nebulae , or cepheids spanning a sufficiently long time span to draw statistically justifiable conclusions either ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    for all other tracers",
    "we only find statistically _ insignificant _ ( @xmath286 ) trends of @xmath0 as a function of publication date , both for the full 19902016 time span and for the more recent period since 2005 .",
    "however , we find that in general the uncertainties have been steadily decreasing for all tracers , which largely owing to improvements in the calibration approaches used and access to new and larger samples of tracer objects ( for a related discussion , see paper i ) . in conclusion , neither the centroid- nor the kinematics - based galactic center distance tracers published since 1990 suggest the presence of any significant trends of @xmath0 with publication date .",
    "aiming at deriving a statistically well - justified galactic center distance based on a large variety of tracers and reducing any occurrence of publication bias , we embarked on an extensive data - mining effort of the scientific literature , eventually yielding 273 new or revised @xmath0 estimates published since records began in october 1918 until june 2016 .",
    "our large database of galactic center distance estimates , a fully linked version of which is made available to the scientific community , allowed us to explore the pros and cons of a variety of different approaches used to determine the distance to the galactic center .",
    "we separated our compilation into direct and indirect distance measurements .",
    "the former include distances such as those based on orbital modeling of the so - called s stars orbiting sgr a * , the closest visual counterpart of the milky way s central supermassive black hole , as well as those relying on statistical parallaxes of either the nuclear star cluster or the stellar population in the inner galactic core .",
    "careful assessment of the body of published galactic center distances based on these methods resulted in our galactic center distance recommendation of @xmath287 kpc .",
    "a much larger body of galactic center distance determinations is based on indirect methods , either those relying on centroid determinations for a range of different tracer populations ( e.g. , globular clusters , cepheid , rr lyrae , or mira variables , or red clump stars ) or measurements based on kinematic observations of objects at the solar circle , combined with a mass and/or rotational model of the milky way .",
    "the latter approaches are affected by significantly larger uncertainties than the former , while the central , mean galactic center distances based on the kinematic methods are systematically smaller than those based on centroid determinations .",
    "most centroid - based distances are in good agreement with those resulting from the direct methods .",
    "we did not find any conclusive evidence of the presence of a bandwagon effect in the post-1990 galactic center distance measurements , neither among the direct distance estimates nor among those based on centroid determinations .",
    "our set of kinematics - based distance measurements can not be used to explore this issue given the significant uncertainties associated with the latter methods . however",
    ", these latter measurement can indeed be used to constrain the galaxy s rotation velocity at the solar galactocentric distance using the @xmath264 ratios employed by their respective authors .",
    "we found a gradual increase in the mean value of @xmath2 from @xmath288 km s@xmath5 in the 1990s to @xmath289 km s@xmath5 more recently .",
    "( both values represent the means of the distributions of rotation speeds ; their standard deviations are of order 2030 km s@xmath5 . )",
    "our results thus imply that the iau - recommended galactic center distance ( @xmath290 kpc ) needs a downward adjustment , while the recommendation for the galactic rotation velocity at the solar circle ( @xmath4 km s@xmath5 ) requires an upward revision .",
    "finally , in view of the recent _ gaia _ data release 1 ( lindegren et al . 2016 ) , this is an opportune time to consider the impact on galactic center distance determinations of the improved parallax measurements of upwards of a billion stars that the mission will provide by the end of its nominal five - year duration .",
    "the final _ gaia _ catalog will map a significant fraction of the galactic volume , with particularly high ( distance - dependent ) parallax precision for stars in the solar neighborhood , gradually decreasing toward the galactic center .    because of the high extinction and significant crowding in the galaxy s inner regions , _ gaia _ s optical ( @xmath291-band ) measurements will reach the galaxy s central regions , but not the center itself .",
    "it is anticipated that _ gaia _",
    "s direct distance determinations of stars near the galactic center will be accurate to approximately 20% , i.e. , significantly worse than the distance estimates provided by any of the direct methods discussed in section [ direct.sec ] or the cepheid - based result of matsunaga et al .",
    "however , _",
    "gaia s _ homogeneous and extensive final catalog will undoubtedly facilitate a significantly improved _",
    "statistical _ determination of @xmath0 based on kinematic measurements at as well as inside the solar circle . in addition , _ gaia _ will provide improved distance measurements to large numbers of standard candles , thus almost certainly improving their zero - point accuracies , which in turn will allow us to test for the effects of population differences associated with the use of secondary distance tracers .    _",
    "gaia _ is currently among the best - placed facilities to resolve the remaining uncertainties in the galactic distance scale , which is no longer seriously affected by statistical uncertainties .",
    "the prevailing uncertainties preventing us from determining a more accurate distance to the galactic center are systematic in nature . among the latter , the effects of not just variations in the extinction , but of possible variations in the prevailing extinction _ law _",
    "are among the most important stumbling blocks .",
    "the data set analyzed in this paper is , unfortunately , unsuitable for systematic studies of the uncertainties introduced by variations in the extinction law ( e.g. , nishiyama et al . 2009 ; nataf et al .",
    "2016 ; and references therein ) .",
    "this is particularly so , because the vast majority of the individual data points retrieved from the literature have been extinction - corrected by their respective authors using the most appropriate approaches available at the time of their analyses .",
    "this implies the inherent presence of intrinsic inhomogeneities in the extinction corrections , which are impossible to fully correct for at the present time .",
    "in addition , we point out that current empirical estimates of reddening laws in the local universe are mainly based on optical and near - infrared photometry . to further constrain possible systematic effects , independent approaches based on either analyses of diffuse interstellar bands ( e.g. , munari & zwitter 1997 ; wallerstein et al . 2007 ; munari et al . 2008 ; kashuba et al . 2016 ) or",
    "spectroscopic studies ( e.g. , kudritzki et al . 2012 ) may shed new light on this long - standing problem .",
    "indeed , detailed , large - scale studies such as that of nataf et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , perhaps combined with high spatial resolution observations of carefully selected , homogeneous samples of galactic center objects at near- to mid - infrared wavelengths ( such as those anticipated to result from _ wfirst _ operation or from campaigns with the next generation of 30 m - class ground - based telescopes ) , seem most promising to overcome the remaining systematics in the reddening laws .",
