    "it has become clear , after @xmath2 and @xmath3 results , that x - ray observations of seyfert galaxies are key to verifying the predictions and , thus , the validity of unified models of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "they are clearly also crucial to test the applicability of standard accretion disk theories down to the lowest ( l@xmath4=10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 l@xmath7 ) nuclear luminosities .",
    "hard x - ray samples of nearby seyfert galaxies available to date ( e.g. from @xmath8 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; smith & done 1996 , turner et al . , 1998 , bassani et al .",
    "1999 ) have been necessarily biased towards the most x - ray luminous , and less absorbed agns .",
    "however , studies by maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and risaliti , maiolino and salvati ( 1999 ) suggest the existence of a large fraction ( @xmath950 - 60% ) of highly obscured agns in the local universe .",
    "other recent studies by ho et al .",
    "( 2001 ) with @xmath10 have made possible , for the first time , the detection of point - like nuclear sources in a large sample of nearby galaxies at unprecedented low luminosities ( down to less than 10@xmath11 erg / s ) , and such studies seem to suggest that the standard unified model for seyfert galaxies ( antonucci 1993 ) may not hold down to these very low luminosities .    with the aim of sorting out the questions raised by the above observations , here new results obtained with the epic ccds on - board @xmath0 are presented .",
    "we are now completing a survey of all known northern seyfert galaxies with d@xmath1222 mpc using the revised - ames catalog of bright galaxies ( sandage & tamman 1981 ) spectroscopically classified by ho , filippenko & sargent ( 1997 ) .",
    "the final sample contains 28 galaxies ( see table 1 in cappi et al . , 2002 ) and is the deepest and most complete local sample of seyfert galaxies in the optical energy band .",
    "compared to previous studies , the strenght of using @xmath0 rests on two main facts : its high - throughput ( especially at e@xmath132 kev ) allows to search spectral components with absorption columns up to @xmath14 @xmath1 10@xmath15 - 10@xmath16 @xmath17 , and its spatial resolution ( hpr@xmath187 arcsec ) allows to minimize any strong contamination from off - nuclear sources to the soft ( e@xmath12 2 kev ) and/or hard ( e@xmath132 kev ) energy band .      about 250 ksec of epic guaranteed time ( di cocco et al . , 2000 )",
    "have been given to our team to perform this survey .",
    "to date , 20 out of 28 seyfert galaxies have been observed , and the data analyzed .",
    "exposures of 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 ks , were requested in order to obtain @xmath11000 source counts per galaxy .",
    "spectra were fitted using data from the 3 ccd detectors ( mos1 , mos2 and pn ) simultaneously .",
    "data were fitted between 0.3 - 10 kev for mos1/2 and between 0.5 - 10 kev for the pn .",
    "every spectrum has been fitted using a set of standard models : a single power - law model with galactic absorption plus either i ) free absorption , or ii ) a warm - absorber , or iii ) a single soft - scattered component , or iv ) a single soft thermal component , or v ) a scattered plus thermal soft component .",
    "we then added a narrow fek emission line if detected .",
    "six examples of such spectra are shown in figures 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 to illustrate the data available and some of our early results .",
    "best - fit spectra and model parameters will be reported elsewhere ( cappi et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "figure 1.1 shows two examples of seyfert 1.5 galaxies ( ngc5273 and ngc3227 ) that do have significant ionized absorption ( with ionized columns equivalent to @xmath1 1 and 7 @xmath19 10@xmath15 @xmath17 , respectively ) .",
    "figure 1.2 shows two examples of seyfert 2 galaxies ( ngc4725 and ngc4168 ) that do not have significant absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "figure 1.3 ( left ) illustrates a case of an underluminous seyfert 2 galaxy ( l@xmath20 @xmath1 5 @xmath19 10@xmath11 erg / s , to be compared to an expected value , based on the observed l@xmath21 , that is @xmath1 40 times larger ) .",
    "figure 1.3 ( right ) shows the single clear case ( ngc3079 ) yet in our sample of a compton thick source , that is evidenced by the strong fek line ( with ew@xmath11.9@xmath220.5 kev ) .",
    "in addition to the high - quality @xmath0 images available , we also checked the @xmath10 snapshot observations ( available for 12 sources out of the 20 analyzed yet ) to check for possible bright off - nuclear point sources that may have contaminated the @xmath23 spectra .",
    "we estimate that off - nuclear point - sources and/or diffuse emission may contaminate both the soft and hard emission in less than @xmath1 1/5@xmath24 of the sources , while up to @xmath1 1/3@xmath25 of the sources could be contaminated in the soft band only .",
    "further work is under way to quantify and take this effect into account in the scientific analysis .",
    "\\i ) three out of the five seyfert 1/1.5 present in the sample do show heavy ( @xmath110@xmath15 @xmath17 ) ionized absorption in x - rays , in agreement with what found also in higher - luminosity type 1 agns ( e.g. reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "\\ii ) most seyfert 1.9@xmath262 are underluminous in x - rays with respect to what expected from their h@xmath27 luminosities ( cappi et al . , in preparation ) , in agreement with what was found by ho et al . ( 2001 ) and terashima et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "\\iii ) most seyfert 1.9/2 do not show neither strong absorption , nor strong fek lines . in some sources , the low absorption could be due to the extra contribution in soft x - rays from nearby off - nuclear sources .",
    "we estimate however that this effect is not relevant in the majority of the cases studied so far .",
    "the possibility that such sources might be compton - thick appears also unlikely given the absence of a strong fek line ( except for ngc3079 ) .",
    "if confirmed , these results appear to be in contrast with the simplest version of unified models ."
