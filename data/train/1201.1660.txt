    "particle acceleration to the energies @xmath9  gev is now firmly established from the  band observations of all the three types of objects @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the required power could be provided by acceleration process which operates at the distance and time scales scales larger than individual supernova remnants , e.g. in superbubbles @xcite and/or even continuously throughout the galaxy ( ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "evidence in favor of such scenario is found from the study of chemical composition of the low - energy cosmic ray flux @xcite and from the direct association of gev band extended emission with particle acceleration in cygnus superbubble @xcite .",
    "clarification of the physical mechanism responsible for the cr production requires localization of the cr sources in space .",
    "this could , in principle , be done using  observations .",
    "this possibility arises because crs confined in the source could interact with low - energy particles producing s and neutrinos .",

    "we further argue that the presence of the young pulsars inside most of the degree - scale extended sources points to the possibility that crs with energies above 1  tev are injected by the pwn or by the composite snr ( shell - like snr confining a pwn ) systems , while distributed acceleration of cosmic rays in shocks produced by multiple supernovae and stellar wind bubbles might be most important at lower energies .",

    "the observed degree - scale extended emission could be produced by both the proton / nuclear crs and electrons / positrons escaping from the sources .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the two contributions based on the  data only .",
    "we suggest that the two contributions could be distinguished based on the complementary observations in the infrared band and in the vhe neutrino channel .",

    "<S> we consider a possibility of identification of sources of cosmic rays ( cr ) of the energy above 1  tev via observation of degree - scale extended  emission which traces the locations of recent sources in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> such emission in the energy band above 100  gev is produced by cr nuclei and electrons released by the sources and spreading into the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we use the data from the fermi  telescope to locate the degree - scale 100  gev   sources . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the number of such sources and their overall power match to those expected when crs injection events happen every @xmath0  yr in portions of @xmath1  erg . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the sources are associated to pulsars with spin down age less than @xmath2  kyr and hence to the recent supernova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the hypothesis of supernova origin of galactic crs . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the degree - scale extended emission does not surround shell - like supernova remnants without pulsars . based on this observation </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the presence of the pulsar is essential for the cr acceleration process . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that a significant fraction of the degree - scale sources should be detectable as extended sources with km@xmath3-scale neutrino detectors . </S>"
