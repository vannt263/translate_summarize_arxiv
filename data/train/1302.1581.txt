    "unlike the optical , x - ray , and @xmath12-ray sky , which have been systematically studied in the time domain in the search for supernovae ( sne ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , the wide - field uv time domain is a relatively unexplored parameter space .",
    "the launch of the _ galex _ satellite with its 1.25 deg diameter field of view , and limiting sensitivity per 1.5 ks visit of @xmath023 mag in the @xmath13 ( @xmath14  ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath15  ) @xcite , enabled the discovery of uv variable sources in repeated observations over hundreds of square degrees for the first time .",
    "the uv waveband is particularly sensitive to hot ( @xmath16 k ) thermal emission from such transient and variable phenomena as young core - collapse sne , the inner regions of the accretion flow around accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , and the flaring states of variable stars .",

    "m dwarf flare stars have strong magnetic activity that manifests itself in flares of thermal uv emission on the timescale of minutes @xcite .",
    "rr lyrae stars have periodic pulsations which drive temperature fluctuations from @xmath17 to 8000 k that cause periodic variability in the uv on a timescale of @xmath18 d @xcite .",
    "core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) remain bright in the uv for hours up to several days following shock breakout , depending on the radius of the progenitor star @xcite , and the presence of a dense wind @xcite .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and quasars demonstrate stronger variability with decreasing wavelength and longer timescales of years @xcite .",
    "uv variability studies of _ galex _ data observed as part of the all - sky , medium , and deep imaging baseline mission surveys ( ais , mis , dis ) from 2003 to 2007 , yielded the detection of m - dwarf flare stars @xcite , rr lyrae stars , agn , and quasars @xcite , and flares from the tidal disruption of stars around dormant supermassive black holes @xcite . serendipitous overlap of 4 _ galex _ dis fields with the optical cfht supernova legacy survey , enabled the extraction of simultaneous optical light curves from image differencing for 2 of the tidal disruption event ( tde ) candidates @xcite , and enabled the association of transient uv emission with two type iip supernovae ( sne ) within hours of shock breakout @xcite . chance overlap of _ galex _ observations with the survey area of the optical palomar transient factory ( ptf ) detected a type iin sn whose rising uv emission over a few days was interpreted as a delayed shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium @xcite .",
    "motivated by the promising results from the analysis of random repeated _ galex _ observations , and the demonstrated value of overlap with optical time domain surveys , we initiated a dedicated _ galex _ time domain survey ( tds ) to systematically study uv variability on timescales of days to years with multiple epochs of @xmath2 images observed with a regular cadence of 2 days .",

    "_ galex _ tds and ps1 mds are well - matched in field of view , sensitivity , and cadence ( shown in table [ tdsmds ] ) . here",
    "we present the analysis of 42 _ galex _ tds fields which intersect with the ps1 mds footprint , for a total area on the sky of 39.91 deg@xmath1 , which were monitored over a baseline of 3.32 years ( february 2008 @xmath19 june 2011 ) . in this paper",
    "we use ps1 mds deep stack catalogs to characterize the optical hosts of _ galex _ tds sources .",
    "simultaneous uv and optical variability of _ galex _ tds sources culled from matches with the ps1 transient alerts @xcite will be presented in future papers .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : galex ] we describe the _ galex _ tds survey design , and in  [ sec : stats ] we describe our statistical methods for selecting uv - variable sources and characterizing their uv variability . in  [ sec : opt ] we describe the multiwavelength catalog data used to identify the hosts of the uv - variable sources , including archival optical data , a deep ps1 mds catalog , and archival redshift and x - ray catalogs . in  [ sec : class ] we describe our sequence of steps for classifying the _ galex _ tds sources , in  [ sec : disc ] we summarize our classification results , and the uv variability properties of our classified sources . in  [ sec : conc ] we conclude with implications for future surveys .",
    "_ galex _ tds monitored 6 out of 10 total ps1 mds fields , with 7 _ galex _ tds pointings ( labeled ps__fieldname__mos_pointing _ ) at a time to cover the ps1 7 deg@xmath1 field of view . during the window of observing visibility of each _ galex _ tds field ( from @xmath20 weeks , @xmath21 times per year ) ,",
    "they were observed with a cadence of 2 days , and a typical exposure time per epoch of 1.5 ks ( or a 5@xmath4 point - source limit of @xmath22 mag ) , with a range from 1.0 to 1.7 ks .",
    "the @xmath2 detector developed a problem on 2010 may 4 during observations of ps_elaisn1 , and so we do not include epochs observed between this time and when the the instrument was fixed on 2010 june 23 in our analysis .",

    "the median number of epochs per field is 24 .",
    "ps_cdfs_mos00 is an exception with 114 epochs , because it was monitored with a rapid cadence ( @xmath24 hours ) over a period of 10 days in 2010 november .",
    "some offsets in the _ galex _ pointings from the footprint of the ps1 mds fields were necessary in order to avoid uv - bright stars in the field of view that would violate the detector s bright - source count limits .",

    "the _ galex _",

    "since most galaxies are unresolved by the _ galex _ @xmath2 5.3 arcsec full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) point spread function ( psf ) , we can use simple aperture photometry instead of image differencing to measure variability .",
    "we create a master list of unique source positions from the pipeline - generated catalogs @xcite for all the individual epochs , as well as deep stacks of all the epochs , using a clustering radius of 5 arcsec .",
    "this radius is chosen such that for the typical astrometry error of _ galex _ of @xmath30 , the bayesian probability that the match is real is larger than the bayesian probability that the match is spurious @xcite .",
    "the final master list includes 419,152 sources .    in order to select intrinsically variable sources in our survey ,",
    "we first need to characterize the photometric errors .",
    "although the _ galex _ images are poisson - limited , the poisson error underestimates the total error in the _ galex _ catalog magnitudes by a factor of @xmath31 @xcite . this discrepancy is attributed to systematic errors such as uncertainties in the detector background and flat - field .",
    "thus , we measure the photometric error _ empirically _ by calculating the standard deviation of aperture magnitudes in bins of mean magnitude , @xmath32 .",
    "we only include objects in the pipeline - generated catalogs that are detected in all or @xmath3310 epochs . in each bin of @xmath34 objects with @xmath35 ( each bin typically has @xmath34 = 50 to 1000 sources ) , we calculate for each epoch @xmath36 of a total of @xmath37 epochs ,    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the magnitude ( in the ab system ) given by @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the background - subtracted flux in a 6 arcsec radius aperture , @xmath42 = 20.08 , the aperture correction is @xmath43 mag @xcite , and we correct for galactic extinction using the values for @xmath23 listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we use 3@xmath4 clipping to remove outliers in the calculation of @xmath44 which can arise from artifacts .",
    "the astrometric precision depends on the signal - to - noise of the source , thus we also _ empirically _ measure a magnitude - dependent clustering radius .",
    "we do so by measuring the cumulative distribution of spatial separations between the position in each epoch and the mean position for sources in bins of @xmath32 , and record @xmath45 , the value for which 95% of sources have a separation less than or equal to that value .",
    "the resulting value for @xmath46 is a strong function magnitude , increasing from @xmath0 1 arcsec for @xmath47 mag to @xmath0 4 arcsec for @xmath48 mag .",
    "figures [ fig : sig ] and [ fig : dist ] show @xmath44 and @xmath45 for an example _ galex _ tds field ps_cosmos_mos23 , a quadratic fit to the median function for all epochs in that field , and the median function fit over all fields .    in our master list of source positions",
    ", we include all sources detected , including sources detected in only one epoch , and fix the centroid to the epoch for which the source is detected with maximum flux .",
    "we measure forced aperture magnitudes at the positions of each source in epochs where the source was not detected by the pipeline or the spatial separation of the matched source is greater than @xmath45 . when the aperture magnitude is fainter than @xmath49 in an epoch , it is flagged as an upper limit and replaced with @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , where @xmath51 counts s@xmath11 pixel@xmath11 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the exposure time of that epoch in seconds .",
    "we select sources that have at least one epoch for which @xmath54 , where @xmath32 is calculated only from epochs that have a magnitude above the detection limit of that epoch .",
    "we use this selection method to be sensitive to short - term and long - term variability , as well as transients .",
    "this 5@xmath4 selection is quite conservative , and requires variability amplitudes increasing from @xmath55 mag for @xmath56 mag up to @xmath57 mag for @xmath58 mag .",
    "we make the following cuts to the @xmath59 variable source sample to remove artifacts :    )    we remove sources with pipeline artifact flags indicating window bevel reflections or ghosts from the dichroic beam splitter .",
    "we remove the brightest objects , with @xmath60 , due to the large area subtended by the psf which causes uncertainty in the background subtraction .",
    "we select sources within a radius of @xmath61 deg of the center of the field , in order to avoid glints and psf distortions , which are more prominent on the edges of the image , from un - corrected spatial distortions of photons recorded by the detectors .",
    "we do not include objects that are within 1.5 arcmin of a @xmath62 mag source , to avoid regions affected by the bright source s psf and ghost artifacts .",
    "ghost artifacts can appear within @xmath63 arcsec above and below a bright source in the y detector direction .",
    "ghosts are point - like , and thus can only be identified from their y detector position relative to a bright source . while ghosts do not usually appear in the _ galex _ pipeline catalogs , we apply this cut since our forced aperture photometry could mistake ghosts for transient sources .",
    "we veto objects for which in the epoch of maximum @xmath64 or maximum flux , the aperture flux ratio of the object has @xmath65 , where @xmath41 is the 6.0 arcsec radius aperture flux , @xmath66 is the 3.8 arcsec radius aperture flux , and @xmath67 is the maximum cumulative aperture flux ratio measured for 90% of the sources in the reference source sample used to calculate @xmath44 in that epoch .",
    "this cut removes fluctuations in the background due to reflections from bright stars just outside the field - of - view , as well as epochs where the psf is distorted due to a degradation in resolution which sometimes occurs in the y detector direction .",
    "this also vetoes cases when the pipeline shreds a source into multiple sources , and the source is detected as variable because the center of the aperture is off - center from the peak source flux .",
    "finally , we visually inspect all of the remaining variable sources to remove any remaining artifacts that passed through the cuts above .",
    "figure [ gallery ] shows a gallery of good sources and vetoed variable sources from our automated cuts ( for a bright reflection in panel a , an off - center source in panel b , and a likely ghost in panel c ) and manual cuts ( for a diffuse reflection in panel d ) .",
    "our final _",
    "tds 5@xmath4 variable sample after the cuts listed above has a total of 1078 sources .",
    "we characterize the variability of each 5@xmath4 variable uv source using several statistical measures .",
    "we measure the structure function ( following @xcite ) , @xmath68    where brackets denote averages for all pairs of points on the light curve of an individual source with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the 2 day cadence of the observations combined with the seasonal visibility of the fields results in a distribution of time intervals between observations ( shown in figure [ fig : delta ] ) that fall into 6 characteristic timescale bins : @xmath71 = @xmath72 d , @xmath73 = @xmath74 d , @xmath75 = @xmath76 d , @xmath77 = @xmath78 d , @xmath79 yr , and @xmath80 yr .",

    "these catalogs include 894 uv variable sources ( @xmath134 mag in the @xmath2 ) selected from an analysis of archival _ galex _ ais , mis , dis , and guest investigator ( gi ) fields with repeated observations . with a cross - matching radius of 4 arcsec",
    ", we find a match with 36 guvv sources .",
    "for the 15 matches that have guvv classifications , are all classified by guvv as active galaxies ( agn or quasars ) , which are in agreement with our _ galex _ tds classifications .",
    "of the 21 matches without guvv classifications , we find 5 sources classified by _",
    "galex _ tds as rr lyrae , 9 classified as active galaxies ( agn or quasars ) , 6 with optical point - source hosts , and 1 with a galaxy host .",
    "the remaining 302 unclassified sources include 91 with optical point - source hosts , which are likely stars , quasars with non - standard colors ( high - redshift or reddened ) , or unresolved galaxies , 190 with galaxy hosts , and 21 orphans .",
    "the 190 galaxy hosts may either be faint agn with poorly constrained uv light curves , or hosts of uv - bright extragalactic transients . in figure",
    "[ fig : delmax_unclass ] we show the maximum @xmath89 in the @xmath2 as a function of low - state @xmath2 magnitude of the remaining unclassified sources .",
    "the unclassified uv source with the most extreme amplitude , elaisn1_mos15 - 09 with @xmath135 mag , was spectroscopically confirmed to be from the nucleus of an inactive galaxy at @xmath136 , and its uv / optical flare detected by _ galex _ tds and ps1 mds was attributed to the tidal disruption of a star around a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "also in this sample is a uv transient spectroscopically confirmed to be a type iip sn 2010aq at z=0.086 ( cosmos_mos26 - 29 ) , whose uv / optical light curve from _ galex _ tds and ps1 mds was fitted with early emission following sn shock breakout in a red supergiant star @xcite .",
    "both of these spectroscopically classified extragalactic transients are labled in figure [ fig : delmax_unclass ] .",
    "our 5@xmath4 selection criteria translates to a limiting sensitivity to transients in a host galaxy with a magnitude @xmath137 of a magnitude of @xmath138 which ranges from @xmath139 mag for @xmath140 mag to @xmath141 mag for @xmath142 mag .",
    "thus , our variability selection threshold is less sensitive to transients in host galaxies with bright @xmath2 fluxes . on the red sequence of galaxies , where @xmath143 @xcite , this selection effect is not as much of an issue , since already for @xmath144 one gets @xmath137 @xmath145 22 mag .",
    "however , star - forming galaxies on the blue sequence are 2.5 mag brighter in the @xmath2 , and thus the host galaxy brightness can be a factor in reducing the senstivity to faint transients .",
    "for example , our _ galex _ tds 5@xmath4 sample does not include sn 2009kf , a luminous type iip sn in a star - forming galaxy at @xmath146 which we reported our _ galex _ tds detection of in @xcite .",
    "this source varied at only the 4.25@xmath4 level in the @xmath2 during its peak .",
    "however , because this transient was selected from a spatial and temporal coincidence with a ps1 transient alert , we could lower our threshold for variability selection in the uv .",
    "the systematic selection of sn and tde candidates from the joint _ galex _ tds and ps1 mds transient detections will be presented in future papers .",
    "figure [ fig : pie ] shows a pie diagram of the source classifications . out of the total of 1078 _ galex _ tds sources , 62% are classified as actively accreting supermassive black holes ( quasars or agn ) , and 10% as variable and flaring stars ( including rr lyrae , m dwarfs , and cvs ) . note that the relative fraction of the different classes of sources is sensitive to both their intrinsic magnitude distribution , and the magnitude - dependent variability selection function of the sample .",

    "fig : dens_mag ] we show the cummulative surface density distribution of classified uv variable sources as a function of peak magnitude ( high(nuv ) ) and maximum amplitude ( max(@xmath150 ) ) . for the variable uv sources ,",
    "these correspond to total surface densities of @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 deg@xmath8 for quasars , agns , and rr lyrae , respectively . for the transient source",
    ", we can calculate a total surface density rate , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the effective survey time at the cadence that matches the characteristic timescale of the transient . for extragalactic transients such as young sne and tdes ,",
    "which vary on a timescale of days , we use the time intervals for which the fields were observed with a cadence of @xmath156 days . if we include all flaring or transient _ galex _ tds sources with a galaxy host , this yields a surface density rate of @xmath157 deg@xmath8 yr@xmath11 for extragalactic transients . for m",
    "dwarfs which vary on timescales shorter than an individual observation , we use the total exposure time for each epoch .",
    "if we assume a survey with a cadence of 2 days and @xmath158 ksec , this translates to a surface density rate for m dwarfs of @xmath159 deg@xmath8 yr@xmath11 .      various optical studies of rest - frame uv variability in high redshift quasars have demonstrated that the variability of agn increases with decreasing rest wavelength @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : sig_int ] , we show histograms of @xmath148 for the uv variable sources with classifications .",
    "quasars show a distribution of @xmath160 with a mean that is @xmath31 times larger than measured at optical wavelengths from the sdss stripe 82 sample from @xcite .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced in the magnitude of the structure function on years timescales ( s@xmath161 ) , which has a mean that is @xmath162 times larger than the mean measured in the @xmath97-band ( @xmath163 from @xcite .",
    "this trend is consistent with the wavelength dependent rise in variability amplitude observed in the structure function for quasars in the rest - frame uv @xcite and observed uv @xcite .",
    "the fact that agn become bluer during high states of flux @xcite has been attributed to increases in the characteristic temperature of the accretion disk in response to increases in the mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the color variability observed in _",
    "individual _ quasars in their sdss stripe 82 sample is stronger than expected from just varying the accretion rate ( @xmath164 ) in accretion disk models . in a future study , we will use simultaneous uv and optical light curves from _ galex _ tds and ps1 mds for our 358  individual quasars to test this result with a larger dynamic range in wavelength .    for the subsample of 95 quasars with archival redshifts ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) , in figure [ fig : sig_abs ] we plot @xmath148 vs. the low - state @xmath2 absolute magnitude , and find a steep negative correlation fitted by @xmath167 , where @xmath168 , in excellent agreement with the trend for increased variability in lower luminosity quasars seen from optical observations with @xmath169 @xcite , and shallower than expected for a poissonian process which has @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "we also show the subset of 68 agn with archival redshifts ( @xmath171 , @xmath172 ) , which clearly do not show a relation between @xmath160 and low - state @xmath2 absolute magnitude .",
    "this is most likely a result of dilution of the variability amplitude from the contribution of the host galaxy in the @xmath2 .",
    "the largest values of @xmath89 ( plotted in figure [ fig : delmax ] ) are found in rr lyrae and m dwarfs , with a tail of large amplitude variations reaching up to @xmath173 mag in rr lyrae and up to @xmath5 mag in m dwarfs . in the optical ,",
    "the rr lyrae structure function is very weakly dependent on timescale , with an amplitude of @xmath174 mag @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 structure function also shows a weak dependence of amplitude on timescale when comparing the structure function on days to years timescales , however , with an amplitude that is @xmath03 times larger in the @xmath2 than in the optical .",
    "this wavelength dependence on variability amplitude can be explained if the variability is driven by variations in surface temperature from pulsations of the stellar envelope , where higher states of flux are associated with higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "we provide a catalog of over a thousand uv variable sources and their classifications based on optical host properties , uv variability behavior , and cross - matches with archival x - ray and redshift catalogs .",
    "this yields a sample of 53  m dwarfs , 37  rr lyraes , 358  quasars , and 305  agn .",
    "we find median intrinsic uv variability amplitudes in rr lyrae and quasars that are factors of @xmath175 larger than at optical wavelengths , consistent with the expectation for higher temperatures during higher states of flux . the regular cadence and wide area of _ galex _ tds enables us to systematically discover persistent and transient ( i.e. tidal disruption of a star ) accreting supermassive black holes over wide fields of view , study the contemporaneous uv and optical variability of variable stars , and catch young core - collapse supernovae within the first days after explosion .",
    "the overlap of the _ galex _ tds with ps1 mds and multiwavelength legacy survey fields will continue to be helpful for classifying transient sources in these heavily observed fields .",
    "we also measure the surface densities of variable sources and the surface density rates for transients as a function of class in the uv for the first time .    with _ galex _ tds we are only scratching the surface of uv variability .",
    "our 5@xmath4 sample of 1078 sources is less than 0.3% of the 419,152 uv sources in the field ( with an average density of @xmath176 uv sources per square degree down to @xmath177 mag ) .",
    "looking to the future , the discovery rate for uv variable sources and uv transients could increase by _ several _ orders of magnitude with the launch of a space - based uv mission with a wide field of view ( several deg@xmath1 ) , a survey strategy of daily cadence observations over @xmath178 deg@xmath1 , and detectors with an order of magnitude improved photometric precision relative to _ galex_. in the optical sky , 90% of quasars vary with @xmath179 mag on the timescales of years @xcite .",
    "given the factor of @xmath31 larger @xmath160 observed for quasars in the @xmath2 , one could achieve a nearly complete sample of low - redshift quasars with photometric errors of @xmath180 mag . in coordination with a ground - based optical survey , such as pan - starrs2 @xcite or lsst",
    ", this could yield the simultaneous uv and optical detection of @xmath16 variable quasars and @xmath181 rr lyrae and m dwarfs , as well as increase the discovery rate of uv - bright extragalactic transients ( young sne and tdes ) by a factor of @xmath182 .",
