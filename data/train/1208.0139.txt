    "in spite of the recently increased research activity in the field , we still do not have a satisfactory model for the phenomenon of the light - curve modulation of rr  lyrae stars , the so - called blazhko effect , that would be consistent with the wide variety of the ever increasing collection of observations . to find such a model , not only the phenomenology of the light - curve variation",
    "have to be known ; the modulational changes in the atmospheric physical parameters of these stars also impose constraints on the potential blazhko models .",
    "the brightness variations of blazhko rr  lyrae stars can be studied with unprecedented detail and precision through the data of _ corot _ and _ kepler _ space telescopes in a single photometric band , and these studies led to new explanations of the phenomenon with the detection of half - integer frequencies @xcite . however , to derive physical parameters , standard multicolour or spectroscopic observations are needed .",
    "since the modulation periods of blazhko stars span a wide range from about one week to many hundred days , detailed spectroscopic studies with sufficiently large - aperture telescopes are rather difficult to attain .",
    "therefore , moderate - size earth - based multicolour photometric telescopes still have an important role in studying the blazhko effect .    in the context of the konkoly blazhko survey i and ii @xcite",
    ", we have obtained multicolour light curves of bright , northern , fundamental - mode blazhko rr  lyrae stars .",
    "these data have already been successfully utilized to derive the variations in the atmospheric parameters of six modulated stars ( see sect . 6 in @xcite and references therein ) .    according to the explanation of @xcite ,",
    "the blazhko effect is ` a direct consequence of a gradual strengthening and weakening of turbulent convection in the stellar envelope ' . though this model has been seriously criticized on theoretical grounds by @xcite and @xcite , it is also important to confront the predictions of the stothers - model with observational results .",
    "the model predicts that the phase relation between the amplitude and period changes depends on the mean physical properties of the star and it is also in direct connection with the phase relations of the physical parameter variations during the blazhko cycle .",
    "the present paper aims to test if there is any connection between the phase relation of the amplitude and period ( phase ) variations and the mean physical parameters and their variations during the blazhko cycle as proposed by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have selected two stars to study their blazhko modulation in detail , xy  and ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2  d , @xmath3  d ) and uz  vir ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6  d , @xmath7  d ) , which show different phase relations between their amplitude and period ( phase ) variations .",
    "xy  and and uz  vir were extensively observed in the course of the konkoly blazhko survey i @xcite , but the data and the results of the light - curve analysis have not been published yet .",
