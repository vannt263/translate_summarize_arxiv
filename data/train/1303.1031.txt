    "observation of pulsating variable stars is a unique approach to study internal stellar structures and evolutionary status across a broad range of stellar types @xcite .",
    "typical examples of pulsating variables are hydrogen - rich da white dwarfs , cepheids , rr lyraes , @xmath0 scutis and @xmath3 doradus stars .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 scuti stars ( hereinafter , @xmath0 sct stars ) have attracted much attention in recent years because of their great number of radial and non - radial pulsation modes , driven by the @xmath4 mechanism that mostly works in the he ii ionization zone ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they are located at the lower part of the instability strip occupied by main sequence ( ms ) , pre - ms and more evolved stars , and characterized by relatively short - period and low - amplitude variability .",
    "it is well known that periods of classical @xmath0 sct stars are in the range of 0.020.25 days , with amplitudes between 0.003 and 0.9 magnitudes in @xmath5 band .",
    "note that the lower side of these amplitude values is just an observational limit of the ground - based surveys .",
    "kepler have detected a large number of @xmath0 sct stars whose amplitudes are lower than 0.003 magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "also classical @xmath0 sct stars have masses between 1.6 and 2.4 @xmath6 for near solar - metallicity stars , and between 1.0 and 1.3 @xmath6 for metal - poor ( @xmath7 [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) stars @xcite",
    ". there are numbers of detailed reviews describing @xmath0 sct stars and associated issues ( e.g. , see @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .    in order to update statistical view of pulsational and physical characteristics of galactic @xmath0 sct stars",
    ", we collected a large sample of @xmath0 sct stars from ( 1 ) the catalog of @xmath0 sct - type variables ( @xcite , hereinafter r2000 ) , ( 2 ) the catalog of sx phe type variables in globular clusters @xcite and ( 3 ) other individual findings after r2000 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that we compiled @xmath0 sct stars that appeared in the literatures published before 2011 .    not surprisingly , the quantitative increase of @xmath0 sct stars is due to an increasing number of long - term variability observations that surveyed a large fraction of sky .",

    "the general properties of the x - ray and uv - only counterparts are summarized in table [ tab : table5 ] and table [ tab : table6 ] , respectively .    among the x - ray counterparts of @xmath0 sct stars , two algol - type binaries ( rz cas and r cma )",

    "the x - ray origin of these systems are thought to be chromospheric coronal activity of the subgiant star @xcite .",
    "another two of them are known cataclysmic variable stars ( cv ) , and were spectroscopically confirmed as binary system that consist of a white dwarf and @xmath0 sct companion @xcite .",

    "no photometric variability was reported until the wide field infrared explorer ( wire ) satellite @xcite .",
    "the dominant source of x - ray emission is thought to be related to altair s coronal activities @xcite .",
    "although most of the x - ray counterparts do not have information about their x - ray origin , they are all interesting objects for further observations and studies because of their rare characteristics which show @xmath0 sct pulsation and x - ray emission at the same time .",
