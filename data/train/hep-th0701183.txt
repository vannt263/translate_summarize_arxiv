    "sen s construction @xcite of bps and non - bps branes as solitons inside higher dimensional branes and the gutperle / strominger extension to the timelike case @xcite showed the existence of a class of space - like objects in string theory , as spacelike - extended analogs of ordinary ( timelike - extended ) branes , references include @xcite-@xcite . up to now",
    "however s - branes have been rather mysterious as their role and properties have not been fully understood .    in this paper , we argue for a new possible lesson to draw from this class of time dependent solutions . namely we demonstrate how a class of s - brane gravity solutions have time - dependent scaling limits corresponding to charged bubbles of nothing and that s - branes have properties related to black hole thermodynamics .    to understand this statement",
    ", we recall that s - branes type solutions as well as other time dependent solutions including bubbles of nothing @xcite-@xcite can be obtained from ( multi-)black hole solutions via analytic continuation . starting with the @xmath5-dimensional schwarzschild black hole @xcite",
    "as the canonical example @xmath6 and performing the analytic continuation @xmath7 and @xmath8 we obtain the bubble of nothing metric @xmath9 the spatial @xmath10 circle coordinate is compactified with radius @xmath11 to avoid a conical singularity at @xmath12 .",
    "taking @xmath13 we find that bubble solutions are spatially asymptotic to flat space @xmath14 times @xmath15 which is the compact circle direction @xmath10 .",
    "the fact that the spatial asymptotics are fixed means the bubble will continue to expand outward eventually annihilating the entire spacetime .",
    "a fixed time sketch of the bubble is given in fig .",
    "[ wbubble ]    originally bubbles of nothing were found to arise as a semi - classical instability of kaluza - klein spacetime .",
    "later they were also examined as interesting time - dependent systems in their own right .",
    "an interesting question arises however if we consider the role of charged bubble solutions which certainly do not just represent the decay of kaluza - klein spacetimes due to the extra gauge fields present .",
    "horowitz @xcite has recently argued that a class of charged bubbles of nothing are a possible decay product of black holes / strings / branes in quantum gravity .",
    "if true this would be a new , unsuspected and disastrous endpoint of quantum black hole dynamics .",
    "the relationship between bubbles and quantum string decay was argued to arise for string theory on compact circles where there exists a quantum tachyonic instability due to the presence of a winding string mode .",
    "this instability causes the circle radius to pinch off thereby changing the spacetime topology see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bubbles of nothing are relevant to this decay since they are precisely an example of a smooth pinching off of the circle direction .    in this paper , we find that a class of charged bubbles are embedded in previously studied four dimensional s - brane solutions which are future asymptotic to flat space . in a sense",
    "there is a mechanism which allows the compact circle of the bubble to expand , thus forcing the bubble growth to correspondingly slow .",
    "we interpet this behavior as an example demonstrating that closed string tachyon condensation on compact dimensions might not necessarily lead to the destruction of spacetime .",
    "more precisely this paper contains further analysis of the interesting class of solutions discussed in ref .",

    "we show the power of these methods by applying them to subextremal s - dihole solutions which are shown to be bubble boundary changing solutions ( bbcs or bubble dj vu @xmath16 universes ) .",
    "time - dependent gravitational solutions , including s - branes and expanding bubbles , are often related to stationary - exterior solutions by analytic continuation .",
    "the wick rotated coordinates are not necessarily killing directions and the complexified manifold can have time - dependent real sections .",
    "we present an analysis of the toplogy and conformal structure by examining the penrose diagrams of these s - dihole spacetimes .",
    "furthermore these s - branes were originally constructed in order to better understand imaginary d - branes so we discuss how to uplift these four dimensional solutions to m - theory and examine the singularity structure of these solutions over a complexified two dimensional plane @xmath17 .",
    "motivated by the card diagram we also propose a way to define a finite area for these s - branes and relate this result to black hole thermodynamic properties . in section 4",
    "we discuss the related @xmath18-universes which represent two connected , simultaneous s - branes in an s - dipole or @xmath19 universe .",
    "conclusions are then presented and more general relationships between time dependent backgrounds and black holes are outlined .    in appendix  a we compute s - charges when possible and discuss global structure of the s - dihole . in appendix  b we review and relate the bonnor transformation to kaluza - klein reduction , discuss the nontrivial nature of the bonnor transformation and its applications , and we also outline similarities between ring and ergosphere singularities in bonnor - transformed geometries .",

    "ergosphere singularities ' ( which are mapped from the kerr ergosphere via the bonnor transform ) and their properties are described ; their intersection with edge of the card , @xmath20 , generates extremal black holes or sources at imaginary time .      in this subsection",
    "we provide a short review of the card diagrams constructed in refs .",

    "the essential idea of the card diagram is to fully examine weyl solutions in @xmath5 spacetime dimensions which are defined to have @xmath21 killing vectors .",
    "all features of the spacetime are parametrized by two non - trivial coordinates and when these two coordinates are drawn many important geometric properties and causal connectedness can be easily visualized .",
    "the construction of the card diagrams can involve subtleties including understanding how to connect the square root branches which arise and the analytic continuation of solutions over the complex plane .",
    "each spacetime has a particular weyl card diagram and to illustrate this we will review the construction of the schwarzschild black hole card diagram in four dimensions . in this construction",
    "although the usual form of the black hole metric is    @xmath22    it is not explicitly written in weyl form . converting it to the weyl form of the metric    @xmath23",
    "is straighforward however using the relations @xmath24 .",
    "the exterior of the black hole , @xmath25 , is mapped to the region , @xmath26 , and , @xmath27 , so these coordinates form a half plane . in this weyl",
    "form the functions @xmath28 depend only on the two coordinates @xmath29 .",
    "explictly the functions @xmath28 are defined as @xmath30    it was well known before that in weyl coordinates black holes could be drawn as a half infinite plane and that the the black hole horizon corresponded to the line @xmath31 and @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "one of the results of the work in refs .",
    "@xcite was to extend these previous weyl descriptions of black holes so as to examine the spacetime inside the horizon .",
    "the first step is to realize for @xmath33 the coordinate @xmath34 should be analytically continued to @xmath35 . to draw this",
    "we take the initial exterior of the black hole to be a horizontal half plane and draw the interior of the black hole in a two dimensional vertical plane . as we extend @xmath34 in the complex plane",
    "there is a second subtlety which is that the metric is defined through the functions @xmath36 which is a square root function of @xmath34 .",
    "the functions @xmath36 are equal to zero along @xmath37 and beyond this region we must change the sign of the branch by changing the overall sign of @xmath38 .",
    "each of these branches is a region which looks like a 45 - 45 - 90 degree triangle with hypotenuse of length @xmath39 .",
    "there are four such sign choices for the branches @xmath40 and combining these together we find that the interior of the black hole corresponds to a vertical square of length @xmath39 in the @xmath41 plane .",
    "the lower edge corresponds to the black hole horizon , the top horizontal edge corresponds to the black hole singularity and the two vertical sides of the square correspond to the coordinate boundaries @xmath42 .",
    "just like we peformed the analytic continuation @xmath43 which takes us from the exterior of the black hole to the interior , we can perform this analytic continuation again . by this procedure",
    "we find @xmath44 and that this new region is the known kruskal extension of the black hole . in weyl",
    "coordinates the kruskal extension of the black hole into a second asymptotically flat region is very simple and corresponds to a sign change . finally by a further analytic continuation , @xmath45",
    ", we find the second black hole interior corresponding to its white hole initial singularity .",
    "the construction of this region is identicaly to the construction of the first black hole interior . in",
    "all there are four regions of the black hole card diagram which are related by analytic continuation of the coordinate , @xmath34 .",
    "the four pieces of the card diagram can be mapped to the four distinct regions of the the penrose diagram of a black hole as in fig .  2 .",
    "the black magnetic dihole @xcite is the bonnor transform of the kerr black hole .",
    "for any @xmath46 and @xmath47 the dihole consists of two oppositely charged , extremal ( degenerate horizon ) four - dimensional black holes the solution degenerates to the singular non - isotropic vacuum darmois solution @xcite . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the solution is flat space , although in general a bonnor transform of flat space is not flat as we show in the appendix . ] .",
    "we write the dihole metric in the inherited boyer - lindquist coordinates as @xmath49 the black hole horizons appear where the `` ergosphere , '' which is @xmath50 , and horizon function , @xmath51 , intersect ; this is specified in boyer - lindquist coordinates by @xmath52 equivalently in the weyl half - plane @xmath53 the black hole horizons are at ( @xmath31 , @xmath54 ) .",
    "the black holes horizons are in this coordinate system represented by two points on the @xmath55-axis as shown in the left - hand diagram of fig .",

    "the dihole has a conical singularity which can be represented in two ways . for @xmath56",
    ", there is a conical excess strut on the @xmath55-axis between the horizons ; one can also recompactify @xmath57 to eliminate this in favor of conical deficit strings for @xmath58 .",
    "we will see that generally , bonnor transforms of ergospheres @xmath59 are singular when on the interior of cards , but here the ergosphere @xmath50 only intersects the weyl half - plane at the horizons , and is in fact responsible for them .",
    "if one passes through the extremal black hole horizon at @xmath54 , one must change the sign of @xmath60 in the weyl form of the dihole solution @xcite , and the @xmath61 ` ring singularity ' gives the black hole singularity in the ensuing horizontal card .",
    "we now proceed to extend the above diagram to a diagram showing the complexified properities of a weyl spacetime .",
    "since the horizon function @xmath62 with roots @xmath63 is quadratic for kerr / dihole , the weyl coordinates ( and card diagrams ) for these solutions are intimately related to the spherical prolate coordinates @xmath64 and complexified affine coordinates @xmath65 .",
    "we can extend the above diagrams to affine diagrams to show different regions of the complexified geometry .",
    "for the dihole define @xmath66 and set @xmath67 , allowing @xmath68 and @xmath69 to give @xmath70",

    "if we extend the diagram and examine when both @xmath78 or both are @xmath79 , these are vertical card ( time - dependent ) regions .",
    "we know from card diagrams that these regions are cut into triangles by the special null lines corresponding to where @xmath80 ( see figs .  [ sdiholefig2],[sdiholefig5 ] ) .",
    "although the coordinates @xmath81 are complexified , there still exist two dimensional real sections of the complexified spacetime which can be plotted .",
    "we study the ergosphere , @xmath50 , and ring , @xmath82 , singularity loci in terms of affine coordinates @xmath81 for the complex plane @xmath17 .    for the dihole the family of polynomials",
    "@xmath83 vanish to define @xmath84 in terms of the complex affine coordinates .",
    "the locus @xmath85 is only algebraically singular for @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath86 , or for @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 . these vertices can be seen in figs .",
    "[ sdiholefig2],[sdiholefig5 ] .",
    "killing circles become null or vanish at @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath89 or @xmath74 .",
    "the real manifold s card diagram , with four cards attaching at a horizon , is in some sense a square - root - fold over those @xmath86 which serve as horizons .    for the dihole ,",
    "the ring singularity is @xmath90 which is a reducible polynomial in the reals : the singularity cuts the diagram as two lines across the real @xmath91 diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sdiholefig2 ] .",
    "again we emphasize that this diagram is the two dimensional real section of the spacetime over complex coordinates and hence the diagram represents physical spacetimes .",
    "note then that the top region i is free of singularities , being the exterior to both black holes .",
    "the bottom region iv has two singularities , each cutting off its black hole horizon ( @xmath86 vertex ) from the negative - mass complement .",
    "the side regions ii and iii each have one ring singularity locus , cutting off the appropriate black hole interior from the negative - mass complement of the black hole .",
    "the ergosphere is the hyperbola @xmath92 .",
    "this hits the vertices @xmath86 and does not enter the horizontal card regions i , ii , iii , iv .",
    "thus the only effect on the ` ergosphere singularity ' on the physical black dihole spacetime is to pierce the real weyl half - planes at vertices @xmath54 , @xmath31 and to create the extremal horizons . in the limit where the parameter @xmath93 goes to zero , the charge of the solution also goes to zero .",
    "one might wonder if this is a schwarzschild black hole , but as we have noted earlier , it is the singular darmois solution . in our analysis",
    "this fact corresponds to the fact that when @xmath94 the ring singularity degenerates to the double line @xmath95 , and the ergosphere becomes two lines , @xmath73 .",
    "the darmois solution therefore can be interpreted as a non - spherically symmetric superposition of a schwarzschild solution and an ergosphere singularity .    for the dihole and related solutions ,",
    "it is satisfying that many features of the geometry admit a simple description in terms of hyperbolas and intersecting lines , and that distinguished points occur at the intersection with special surfaces @xmath20 , or at algebraically singular points .",
    "further discussion of these singularity loci is given in section 3 , and in appendix [ characterappendix ] .",
    "previously a class of solutions , which we now call s - dihole , were found by the present authors .",
    "these solutions in fact constitute a collection of different einstein - maxwell solutions related by analytic continuation .",
    "we will focus on a particularly interesting class of the solutions which are boundary changing solutions representing two formations and decays of a ( momentarily expanding ) bubble of nothing .",
    "these spacetimes we name the bubble dj vu or @xmath16 universes . related simultaneous s - branes or @xmath19 universes are discussed in sec .",
    "[ euniversessec ] .    it is a new phenomenon to see a bubble of nothing decay and so we begin with some introductory remarks to describe how this seems to arise . from the work of horowitz@xcite , and adams et al @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the effect of the closed string tachyon mode on a compactified circle direction in the presence of anti - periodic fermions is to shrink the circle and cause it to undergo a topology changing pinch .",
    "the bubble of nothing is a gravitational solution showing such a pinching off of the circle .",
    "one can ask however what happens if we take the t - dual of this solution around the circle direction . in this case",
    "the region of the circle which pinched to zero , now goes to infinity instead . following the effect of t - duality ,",
    "we are lead to conclude that kk momentum modes can cause extra dimensions to become large . while winding modes shrink a circle , momentum modes cause a circle to expand .",
    "if a solution has momentum or pressure along the circle direction this will cause the kaluza - klein circle to grow which in turn slows the bubble of nothing .",
    "one key tool which we use to better understand these non - trivial geometries is the weyl card diagram .",
    "the power of these diagrams is that they allow for a clear and accurate geometric visualization of the spacetimes and their analytic continuations .",
    "simultaneously understanding the analytic continuations and the original spacetimes allows us to properly investigate the nature of the singularities which include imaginary black holes and d - branes .",
    "also , these diagrams clearly mark near horizon scaling limits and prove useful in uncovering some novel relationships between s - branes and black hole thermodynamics .",
    "we first write down the subextremal s - dihole solution , and analyze how the cards on the affine diagram can be arranged into the six s - dihole universes . the s - dihole is gotten from the black dihole ( [ diholesol ] ) by @xmath97 here , the @xmath98-flip of @xcite means we flip the sign of the @xmath99 non - killing metric in ( [ diholesol ] ) or equivalently , we change the sign of the entire metric and continue @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath98-flip procedure preserves the reality of the magnetostatic gauge field .",
    "the solution is then @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "changing to spherical prolate coordinates by setting @xmath105 , we obtain @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "s - dihole has the horizon function @xmath108 and in the subextremal case @xmath109 , its spherical prolate diagram ( fig .",

    "for @xmath423 s north pole , flat space is written on the horizontal card @xmath426 as @xmath427 the corresponding instanton ( @xmath428 ) has a self - dual nut @xcite at @xmath429 for the killing vector @xmath430 .",
    "the point is then that since the bonnor transform relies on ( i ) a choice of two killing directions to put the metric in weyl - papapetrou form and ( ii ) and choice of one of those two killing directions to be ` time . ' as this choice is not unique , and we can even have a nontrivial bonnor transform of flat space . in the present example , the near - north - pole limit of @xmath423 , with its killing time @xmath259 and azimuth @xmath57 , transforms to give us the s - rn solution in poincar / parabolic coordinates @xcite , where @xmath431 is reduced and @xmath57 becomes the bubble euclidean circle .",
    "kerr s ergosphere has become the s - rn singularity .",
    "the ergosphere singularity of a dilatonized version of s - melvin was found and discussed in @xcite . just as dilatonized melvin can be obtained by twisting a completely flat kk direction with an azimuthal angle @xcite , dilatonized s - melvin",
    "can be obtained by twisting a completely flat kk direction with a boost parameter .",
    "the ergosphere singularity is then where the twisted kk direction becomes null .",
    "on one side of the ergosphere singularity ( small @xmath34 on the horizontal card ) , the twisted kk direction is spacelike whereas on the other side ( large @xmath34 on the horizontal card ) it is timelike yielding a kk ctc .",
    "actually , this is a general feature of ergosphere singularities in einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory : the singularity occurs where the kk killing direction goes null .",
    "this also occurs in the bonnor transformation ( see appendix [ characterappendix ] ) .",
    "we wish to emphasize the following connection : the ` ergosphere , ' where a timelike killing direction of say kerr becomes null and switches to spacelike , maps via the bonnor transformation to an ergosphere singularity of say the s - dihole @xmath340 , where a dilatonized version has a kk circle changing signature .",
    "the precise connection is that the bonnor transformation can be understood from the kk perspective in reducing from five to four dimensions .",
    "if we take a magneto - weyl ( mw ) solution ( [ bonnortrans ] ) and dilatonize it with @xmath225 @xcite we get @xmath432 lifting to 5 dimensions @xcite , we get @xmath433 and the killing @xmath434 becomes completely flat .",
    "it may be dropped and the resulting 4d solution is a kerr - type instanton . upon continuing @xmath435 and @xmath436 ,",
    "the @xmath437 direction becomes kerr time .",
    "hence @xmath437 and @xmath438 change signature on the same complexified locus , the ` ergosphere . '    for a time - dependent weyl - papapetrou geometry , we can add a trivial _ space _ direction and then kk reduce along a different space direction , and undilatonize .",
    "there is no analytic continuation in this case and this is why s - dihole , as the bonnor transform of s - kerr , does not have @xmath439 relative to it .",
    "the bonnor transform is related to @xmath440 kk reduction and weyl dilatonization procedures .",
    "these dilatonization procedures will not change spacetimes with simple card diagrams , but will destroy the interesting structure of those card diagrams where the special null line serves as conformal null infinity , such as the @xmath16-type and @xmath18-type universes .",
    "we give a brief characterization of ergospheres and their bonnor - transforms , and compare them with the ` ring ' singularity .",
    "the bonnor transform of ergospheres and ring ( i.e. usual curvature ) singularities in fact are shown to have identical properties .    given a @xmath99 killing metric in the weyl - papapetrou form ( [ wpform ] ) with the understanding that @xmath441 is a distinguished direction for an ensuing bonnor transformation , we can define its ergosphere locus to be the nonsingular locus where the function @xmath442 vanishes .",
    "then @xmath421 must have a pole like @xmath443 so that @xmath444 where we have nondegeneracy away from @xmath20 . in the interior of a card , from ( [ wpform ] )",
    "we see that @xmath445 to keep the coefficient of @xmath446 finite .",
    "thus in the bonnor - transformed geometry ( [ bonnortrans ] ) we see that the coefficients of @xmath447 and @xmath446 vanish like @xmath448 , the coefficient of @xmath449 blows up like @xmath450 , and the magnetic potential @xmath391 blows up like @xmath443 .",
    "( at the card boundary @xmath31 , we have seen for the dihole that instead , the ergosphere gives nonsingular extremal black holes which are locally ads@xmath451 . )",
    "this characterization of ergosphere singularities will help us to identify them  because upon dilatonization and a kk lift to 5d , they are resolved as noted in the previous subsection ..    when the weyl - papapetrou geometry is singular , we do not have much to say in general , but we will look at the bonnor transform of the kerr ring singularity and find a surprise . there , @xmath452 blows up , and @xmath453 stays finite .",
    "then , the bonnor - transformed geometry has non - killing @xmath446 as well as @xmath449 vanish like @xmath450 and the @xmath447 direction blows up like @xmath448 .",
    "also , one can compute the electric em - dual potential for the black dihole : @xmath454 and this blows up like @xmath442 .",
    "( it is not surprising that the electric potential blows up at the curvature singularity of a charged black hole . )",
    "thus the bonnor transform of a ring singularity is just like that for an ergosphere , but with the roles of @xmath57 and @xmath259 exchanged .",
    "it them seems possible that @xmath61 could be made nonsingular with the right inverse transform . in the present dihole case ,",
    "the locus intersects the real spacetime at a vertex point where it is algebraically singular , and also is a subset of the ergosphere singularity .",
    "unfortunately there are no immediately new nonsingular geometries from this idea .",
    "we review the dihole fluxbrane wave solution of @xcite . it is gotten from the dihole ( [ diholesol ] ) by sending @xmath455 , @xmath456 .",
    "then @xmath457 , and shifting @xmath391 to remove the dirac string , the solution is @xmath458 periodically identifying @xmath459 eliminates the conical singularity at @xmath332 .",
    "the analytic continuation @xmath456 is equivalent to @xmath460 , where @xmath461 and @xmath462 is a symmetric line ( just like @xmath213 was a symmetric line ) but there is no other distinguished @xmath463 .",
    "we draw a spherical prolate diagram ( fig .",
    "[ sdiholefig3 ] ) .",
    "the dihole wave occupies region i , where time points right .    in weyl coordinates , one obtains the dihole wave by @xmath464 , @xmath455 .",
    "the card diagram is a vertical half - plane @xmath465 , @xmath466 .",
    "the sources ( the extremal black hole horizons , which appear as points in weyl coordinates ) are located at @xmath31 and @xmath467 .",
    "these are interpreted as the intersection of @xmath20 with the nonsingular ergosphere hypersurface @xmath50 ( see appendix [ kerrappendix ] ) .    the continuation to get",
    "the dihole wave is very similar to that to get the kerr @xmath468-bubble @xcite , which is @xmath469 , @xmath470 , @xmath439 ; there is then a twisted circle closing at @xmath332 .",
    "we can think of the dihole wave as the bonnor transform of the kerr bubble ( there is no relative @xmath439 between them , since the associated 5d killing submetrics have signature @xmath471 ; see sec .",
    "[ kkinterpsec ] ) .    further discussion of the wave - like character of this solution , the asymptotic fall - off on a null line on the card diagram , scaling limits of the fluxbrane wave including the melvin universe and the cone can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "like the dihole wave fall off , we can also examine the s - schwarzschild solution @xmath472 and our approach will be to examine the physical properties of this solution and evaluate the s - brane in a different coordinate patch . the main question is what does the parameter @xmath347 represent . in the case of the black hole",
    "this represents the mass or energy of the black hole due to a massive source .",
    "now let us examine the wick rotation process from the black hole to the s - brane .",
    "this changes the time direction to a spatial direction @xmath55 and as a consequence the energy of the original black hole is now interpreted not as an energy but as a pressure source .",
    "if we add an electric charge , @xmath473 , to the black hole then there is a stress tensor for the spacetime with @xmath474 now let us examine the wick rotation process from the black hole to the s - brane which changes the time direction to a spatial direction @xmath475 and the radial direction to a time direction @xmath476 . therefore the energy of the original black hole is now interpreted not as an energy but as a pressure @xmath477 .",
    "the pressure is clearly identified in the case of the electromagnetic contribution to the s - brane and likewise the same should hold for the uncharged s - brane using an adm type of definition of the pressure .",
    "clearly the pressure should be and is positive for consistency if we want the @xmath478direction to contract .",
    "a negative parameter @xmath347 should then correspond to negative pressure and this is exactly in accordance with the cosmological use of s - brane solutions for cosmology .",
    "the parameter @xmath347 we then interpret as a pressure of the s - schwarzschild solution . in general one could call an s - brane a `` pressure''-brane .",
    "we next use the schwarzschild panleve coordinate which foliates the spacetime into flat three dimensional slices at every point in time @xmath479 performing the usual wick rotation in this coordinate system gives the s - brane @xmath480 further transforming this milne coordinate to the usual slicing of minkowski gives @xmath481 and we see that for fixed @xmath55 coordinate values we get three dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the evolution of this spacetime is a mixture of ingoing and outgoing waves centered along @xmath482 which hit / emit from a timelike singularity and spread out in the @xmath55-direction ; the singularity is null in the @xmath483-directions but has a timelike component coming from the z - direction .",
    "travel purely in the radial direction gives flat space .",
    "the null singularity however is to be expected any time there is a spacelike singularity source at @xmath330 and the horizon at @xmath484 is the relativistic effect .",
    "the @xmath55-direction represents the extension of the s - brane although in this coordinate system it is clear that there is no linear mass in the system along the @xmath55-direction unless the angular coordinate @xmath57 has a conical deficit corresponding to an orbifold of the original hyperbolic slicing .",
    "however this linear direction gets squeezed by the pressure of the system caused by the mixture of traveling momentum .",
    "what is unusual however is that there is no asymptotic region @xmath485 where we can see the conical string since we are bounded by the singularity ; the conical singularity is only visible locally . in this sense",
    "this solution appears as a singular birth and death of a universe .",
