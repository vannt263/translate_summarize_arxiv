    "mergers of gas - rich galaxies are likely to play a key role in the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) through accretion , particularly in the triggering of quasar phases @xcite .",
    "quasars may also represent an important phase in the evolution of galaxies due to radiative feedback @xcite .",
    "this sequence of events is a potential scenario linking the evolution of galaxies and the growth of smbhs @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both the merger and quasar phases can manifest themselves as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with double - peaked narrow emission lines in their spectra . specifically , during a galaxy merger , when the smbhs are separated by @xmath51 kpc and are actively accreting as a dual agn @xcite they will each produce doppler - shifted emission from their narrow line regions ( nlrs ) , resulting in a double - peaked profile in the integrated spectrum . in the feedback scenario ,",
    "radiation from a single quasar can drive bi - conical outflows of the nlr @xcite , producing similar emission line profiles @xcite .",
    "agn whose spectra exhibit double - peaked narrow emission lines ( i.e. they are best fit by two components ) represent a sub - class of the agn population",
    ". extended , offset and double - peaked line profiles have been observed in the narrow emission lines of agn since the earliest studies of agn nlrs @xcite .",
    "these complex narrow line profiles are observed in both type 1 and type 2 agn @xcite , and they are generally most pronounced in forbidden transition lines of high ionization potentials ( i.p.s ) . in particular ,",
    "such observations have often focused on the 5007  transition line of [ ]  ( @xmath6 ev ) since it is a relatively intense emission line produced by the ionizing continuum of agn and is accessible in optical spectra ( see @xcite and @xcite for examples ) . however , there is even variation among the high - ionization lines , with those of the highest ionization potentials , such as [ ]  ( @xmath7 ev ) , and [ ]  ( @xmath8 ev ) , displaying the largest velocity offsets @xcite .    in the dual agn scenario ,",
    "the two emission line peaks are produced by the orbital motion of two agn within a single merger remnant galaxy .",
    "this interpretation is intriguing since smbhs reside in the bulges of galaxies , and dual smbhs ( kpc - scale separations ) are a stage of galaxy mergers before the smbhs coalesce .",
    "the existence of dual agn has been confirmed observationally in several serendipitous cases , most notably in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies as pairs of x - ray point sources @xcite .",
    "systematic searches for dual agn in large spectroscopic databases , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and deep2 @xcite have involved identifying agn with double emission line systems @xcite .",
    "promising results are being obtained through follow - up observations in the form of high - resolution optical imaging @xcite , near - infrared ( nir ) adaptive optics imaging @xcite , spatially resolved spectroscopy @xcite , hard x - ray observations @xcite , radio observations @xcite , and diagnostics deduced statistically from longslit spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "a sample of dual agn will be useful in studying the connection between galaxy interactions / mergers and agn activity @xcite , and for refining the galaxy merger rate @xcite .    in the outflow scenario , offset or double - peaked narrow emission lines are often attributed to radially flowing nlr gas driven by energy from the agn .",
    "furthermore , this effect is also thought to produce a stratification of the nlr since the incident ionizing flux and electron density should diminish with increasing distance from the nuclear source .",
    "this will result in the production of different lines in varying proportions as a function of radius from the agn @xcite .",
    "observationally , luminous quasars are known to have extended nlrs driven by energy from the agn coupled to the interstellar medium gas @xcite , and powerful radio galaxies often show complex , spatially extended nlrs with multiple components aligned along the radio axis .",
    "models for this alignment include reflection of the agn emission @xcite or material entrained in a radio jet @xcite . in agn with sufficiently high eddington ratios , radiation pressure acting on gas and dust @xcite or a hot wind that entrains the nlr clouds @xcite are possible mechanisms capable of driving the line splitting .",
    "whichever mechanism is the dominant driver of outflows in an individual source , they may represent cases of agn feedback , which might be important in quenching star formation in galaxies following a merger and in establishing the observed correlations between smbh masses and host galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "whether agn with double - peaked emission lines represent dual agn or powerful agn outflows , they have proven useful for investigating several aspects of agn evolution , including agn triggering and feedback",
    ". systematic searches for double - peaked agn have primarily utilized the [ ] @xmath4  emission line and have therefore been limited to below redshifts of @xmath9 since [ ] @xmath4  is not accessible in optical spectra at higher redshifts .",
    "however , there is evidence that at high redshifts galaxy mergers were more prevalent , and agn outflows might have played an important role in the evolution of galaxies at @xmath10 , including massive radio galaxies @xcite . furthermore , there is significant controversy over the role that galaxy mergers play in agn activity and smbh growth at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "therefore , a sample of high redshift double - peaked narrow line agn will be important for investigating these questions .",
    "so far only one such candidate dual agn has been identified above @xmath11 as a serendipitous discovery at @xmath12 through double - peaked uv and optical emission lines , particularly evident in [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this discovery , we have conducted a systematic search for additional agn at high redshift ( @xmath13 ) with double - peaked [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2  emission lines .",
    "these emission lines have relatively high ionization potentials and trace the gas photoionized by the agn continuum .",
    "furthermore , they are likely to originate in the inner ( more highly ionized ) portion of the nlr , allowing for the identification of agn driven outflows at @xmath0",
    ". this study will also serve as a first attempt at extending the identification of candidate dual agn to higher redshifts .    in section [ analysis ]",
    "we describe our parent sample and how we selected our final sample and low - redshift comparison sample . in section [ redshifts ]",
    "we describe the systemic redshifts we will use throughout the paper . in section [ sec : offsets ] we describe the general properties of our sample and our estimates of selection completeness . in section [ kinematics ]",
    "we investigate several correlations among the emission line properties that aid in illuminating the origin of the double - peaked line profiles . in section [ radio ] we describe the radio properties of our sample and compare them to our parent sample . in section [ interpretation ]",
    "we discuss the most likely physical mechanisms driving the line - splitting , particularly focusing on the scenarios of agn outflows and dual agn . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize our main conclusions . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to the maximum likelihood cosmology from the combined wmap+bao+h0 results from the wmap 7 data release of @xcite .",
    "our parent sample consists of archival spectra drawn from the quasar catalog of the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) which is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the typical resolution of the sdss spectra is @xmath192000 . in short ,",
    "inclusion in the catalog requires luminosities brighter than @xmath20 , at least one emission line with fwhm @xmath21 km s@xmath22 or complex absorption features , apparent magnitudes fainter than @xmath23 , and have highly reliable redshifts ( see section [ redshifts ] for a discussion of the redshifts ) .",
    "we restricted the lower redshift limit of the sample to @xmath24 to only include sources _ not _ in the parent samples of [ ] -selected double - peaked emitters from the sdss @xcite since our intention is to select sources which are not identifiable by their methods .",
    "additionally , we required that at least [ ] @xmath1  be accessible in the sdss wavelength range ( @xmath25   ) , which imposes an upper limit of @xmath26 .",
    "we did not make any selection cuts based on the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) .",
    "this resulted in a parent sample of 39,876 sources .",
    "+      our initial selection involved visually identifying quasars from the parent sample ( section [ sample ] ) with detectable double emission line peaks in [ ] @xmath1  and/or [ ] @xmath2 .",
    "these two lines were used since they are accessible in the sdss optical wavelength range at @xmath27 , are relatively strong narrow lines in quasar spectra , and are not severely blended with any other strong lines .",
    "we did not require that two explicit peaks be detectable in both of those emission lines for two reasons : 1 ) the ionizing continuum may be such that [ ] @xmath1  is too weak to be detected whereas [ ] @xmath2  is detectable ; and 2 ) a difference in line ratios and/or velocity - splittings between the two lines may result in one pair being more blended than the other .",
    "therefore , since the purpose of this analysis is to investigate the origin of the double - peaked emission lines , we did not want to exclude those sources which show variations among the line properties .",
    "while [ ] @xmath28  is another strong emission line accessible in most of our parent sample , we did not select sources based on this line since [ ] @xmath28  is a doublet ( @xmath29   ) with @xmath5200 km s@xmath22 separation between the transition wavelengths and is difficult to discern from true peaks , particularly with the limited spectral resolution of the sdss ( see @xcite for a similar discussion ) . in sources where the double peak detections are ambiguous in each line , corresponding peaks in both [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2  are needed for confirmation . out of the parent sample , our visual selection process resulted in 181 preliminary sources .",

    "this modeling proceeded in two stages : 1 ) continuum modeling , and 2 ) emission line modeling .",
    "the continuum was modeled by masking all detectable emission lines and simultaneously fitting a power - law function ( @xmath32 ) for the underlying agn contiuum radiation plus a pseudo - continuum of broadened   emission lines from the empirical templates of @xcite ( @xmath33   ) and @xcite ( @xmath34   ) which were developed from the spectrum of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy",
    "i zw 1 . due to the use of two separate  templates ,",
    "the powerlaw function was allowed to have a break at 3500   , and the  normalization allowed to vary independently below and above the break wavelength .",
    "the  pseudo - continuum is composed of many blended  transitions which are generally believed to originate in or near the classical broad line region ( blr ) , and as such the redshift and broadening of the   emission should be comparable to that of the broad emission lines . therefore ,",
    "in our modeling the  emission was fixed at the redshift of the quasar being modeled ( see section [ redshifts ] for a detailed discussion of the redshifts ) ; we broadened the  template by convolving with a gaussian of @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 km s@xmath22 .",
    "use of this template necessarily limits the minimum @xmath38 best - fit to 900 km s@xmath22 , though this was not a problem since these sources were in the quasar catalog based on the presence of broad lines with @xmath39 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the lower rest - wavelength end of the continuum+  fitting window was 2750   and the upper rest - wavelength end was 3950    ( just redward of [ ]",
    "@xmath2 ) if accessible , or otherwise the red end of the spectral coverage .",
    "this fitting window allowed proper detection of the   emission since it has a relatively large equivalent width near @xmath40 .",
    "we allowed @xmath41 to vary in steps of 100 km s@xmath22 , and in general , the solutions are in the range @xmath52000 - 9000 km s@xmath22 , though in most cases the quality of the fits were not strongly dependent on the broadening .",
    "+      we fit each emission line ( [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2 ) with both a single and a double gaussian model , and required that sources in our final sample have fits to at least one of these two lines significantly improved by the double gaussian model ( @xmath42 ) . in seven individual line models ,",
    "an additional broad component of line width @xmath43 km s@xmath22 was required for a satisfactory fit .",
    "three of the [ ] @xmath1  fits required such a component , where in two of those cases the broad component is consistent with the blue narrow peak ( j074242.18 + 374402.0 : @xmath44 km s@xmath22 ; and j105035.57 + 190544.2 : @xmath45 km s@xmath22 ) , and in the third case it is consistent with the red narrow peak ( j150243.93 + 281739.9 : @xmath46 km s@xmath22 ) .",
    "four of the [ ] @xmath2  fits required a broad component , where in three of those cases it is consistent with the blue narrow peak ( j105035.57 + 190544.2 : @xmath47 km s@xmath22 ; j105634.56 + 121023.5 : @xmath48 km s@xmath22 ; and j145659.27 + 503805.4 : @xmath49 km s@xmath22 ) and in one those cases it is located between the blue and red peaks ( j085205.91 + 183922.2 : @xmath50 km s@xmath22 ) . we note that in only one of these sources ( j105035.57 + 190544.2 ) is a broad component seen in both [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2 , and it is consistent with the blue peak .",
    "properly accounting for the contribution of flux from  emission is often important in determining the profiles of the emission lines of interest in this wavelength range . in particular",
    ", there is a local peak in the broadened  emission just blueward of [ ] @xmath1 , between 3390    and 3410   , which has the potential to complicate the isolation of the blue [ ] @xmath1  component .",
    "therefore , careful attention was paid to the modeling in this region , and any sources for which the model was ambiguous were not admitted into the final sample . however , there is no significant  emission near [ ] @xmath2 , and only a small local peak redward of [ ] @xmath28  but with which it is not blended",
    ".    from our spectral modeling , there are 38 sources in our sample for which we have measured robust double - peaks in _ both _ [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2 , 42 sources for which we have _ only _ robust [ ] @xmath1  measurements , and 51 sources for which we have _ only _ robust [ ] @xmath2  measurements .",

    "we chose this sample because , as opposed to other double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  samples , it includes type 1 agn which were selected from the sdss quasar catalog .",
    "therefore , it provides a @xmath3 sample which can be used for direct comparison . for the measurements on the [ ] -selected sample , we selected those with robust [ ] / [ ]  double - peaks in the same way as for our high - redshift sample , and likewise modeled the spectra as described above .",

    "if outflows are a common mechanism for driving line - splitting in nlrs , then this should naturally result in a stratified nlr since lines of greater i.p . and",
    "@xmath240 will be preferentially produced nearer to the agn where they are accelerated to higher velocities relative to lines of lower i.p and @xmath240 .",
    "the relative origins and velocities of emission lines in the stratification scenario are illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon ] , where [ ] @xmath1  originates closer to the smbh than [ ] @xmath2 .",
    "we examined this scenario by looking at the relationship between the velocity - offsets of [ ] @xmath1   and [ ] @xmath2   in section [ variation ] . in that analysis ,",
    "figure [ fig : strat]a shows that 60% of the sources have a significantly larger blue velocity offset in [ ] @xmath1  compared to [ ] @xmath2 , suggestive of a stratified nlr .",
    "we are only seeing the projected velocity - offsets , so this percentage might represent a lower limit on the number of sources with stratified nlrs when accounting for random orientations of the outflow axes .",
    "we note that in figure [ fig : strat ] the largest stratifications are seen at the largest velocities .",
    "this could also be a result of projection effects , since orientations which reduce the radial velocity components will also reduce the observed stratification .",
    "however , this trend may also be due , in part , to the physical effect of stronger outflows ( larger velocities ) producing larger stratifications .    for most of the sources in our sample we can only place upper limits on the fluxes and velocity offsets of blue [ ] @xmath28   components .",
    "this is partly due to the blending of the @xmath29   doublet ( section [ sec : initial ] ) .",
    "however , if the double emission line components are driven by outflows and the nlr is stratified , one might expect that [ ] @xmath28 , with a relatively small ionization potential of @xmath278 ev and critical density of @xmath279 @xmath242 , will be strongest in a portion of the nlr relatively further from the central agn . as a result , it will not be accelerated to high velocities , resulting in a small line - splitting .",
    "with the outflow axis oriented at some angle intermediate to edge - on or face - on , the redshifted nlr emission will consequently be more attenuated than the blueshifted emission , as illustrated by the ` obscuring ism ' labeled in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "the portions of the nlr with the largest line of sight velocity components will be most obscured .",
    "conversely , the portions with the smallest line of sight velocity components will be the least obscured .",
    "the result is that , in the presence of such attenuation , the most redshifted portion of the emission lines will obscured , moving the observed position of the red emission peak closer to the systemic , i.e. non - doppler shifted , redshift . in this case",
    "the red component resembles the ` classical ' nlr .",
    "this is consistent with observations in which offset narrow emission lines in agn are usually blueward of the systemic velocity , indicating that we are able to view the outflowing component moving toward the observer , while the component moving away from the observer is obscured by a larger column of dust .",
    "for example , from figure [ offsets ] it appears that the mean magnitude of the red component velocity - offsets from the systemic redshift are generally smaller than those of the blue components , consistent with the notion that the red components are less dominated by outflows .",
    "note that in figure [ fig : cartoon ] , with sufficient attenuation even the nlr emission which is least doppler - shifted will be obscured , resulting an apparent blueshifting of the red component , as is occasionally seen in some of our sources and in other studies @xcite .",
    "for example , the blue [ ] @xmath1  component may be emitted from a portion of the nlr on the observer s side which is closest to the central source and moving at the greatest velocity ( e.g. white dots in figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) , while the red [ ] @xmath1  component is from a portion which is further from the central source ( e.g. grey dots in figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "we did find in section [ ledd ] evidence for a mild positive correlation between the red line offsets and the quasar eddington ratio .",
    "this suggests that , while the red system tends to represent the ` classical ' nlr , it is still effected by the radiation pressure since it must originate close enough to the central source where the ionizing flux is sufficient .",
    "additionally , figures [ fig : strat]b and [ fig : strat]c show that there is some evidence for stratification of the red systems ( though much less significant than for the blue systems ) .",
    "it is possible that some of the sources in our sample may host two smbhs following a galaxy merger . in this case",
    ", the double - peaks may be from two distinct nlrs that each accompanies its own active smbh , or perhaps two nlr peaks are influenced by the orbital motion of two smbhs @xcite .",
    "so far there are only a handful of known plausible merger remnants hosting two agn at redshifts comparable to our sample : @xmath280 @xcite , @xmath281 @xcite , and @xmath282 @xcite .",
    "since galaxy mergers were more frequent at higher redshifts , we would like to investigate the dual agn scenario for the sources in our sample .",
    "the two [ ] -selected confirmed dual agn for which we measured double peaks in [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2  are consistent with no apparent ionization stratification ( figure [ fig : strat ] ) .",
    "additionally , there is only one candidate dual agn identified through the double - peaked profile of [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2 , and it is also consistent with no apparent ionization stratification @xcite . in these sources , the evidence for outflowing nlr material is less compelling , and the line - splitting may instead be produced by orbital motion of two agn about each other .",
    "likewise , the @xmath283 percent of our sources plotted in figure [ fig : strat ] with no apparent ionization stratification may include cases where the double - peaks are the result of two smbhs following a galaxy merger .",
    "additionally , we see explicit double [ ] @xmath28  peaks for a subset ( 11 ) of our sources which perhaps suggests that the outflow scenario is less likely in these sources since [ ] @xmath28  should originate at a greater distance from the central agn , as mentioned in section [ outflows ] .",
    "we note , however , that the lack of an apparent ionization stratification does not preclude the possibility of an outflow , or general gas kinematic origin of the double - peaked emission lines .",
    "for example , the two extended nlr agn from @xcite have no measurable ionization stratification but the double emission components are known to be produced by the nlr around a single agn based on integral - field spectroscopy and high - resolution imaging .",
    "conversely , a stratified nlr ( or two stratified nlrs ) does not preclude the presence of two agn .",
    "for example , as discussed in section [ variation ] , our measurement of [ ] /[]@xmath2   in the confirmed dual agn sdss j150243.1 + 111557 shows some evidence for a stratification .",
    "+      as is evident from figure [ offsets ] and discussed in section [ sec : offsets ] , the velocity - splittings in our sample are generally larger than those from [ ] -selected samples , which might tend to select against likely dual agn candidates at kpc - scale separations since they would not be bound to the merging galaxy system with such large velocities .",
    "most strong dual agn candidates have @xmath226s less than @xmath284 km s@xmath22 : @xmath285 km s@xmath22 @xcite , @xmath233 km s@xmath22 @xcite , @xmath286 km s@xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath287 km s@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "however , there are several candidates with velocities @xmath288 km s@xmath22 : @xmath289 km s@xmath22 @xcite and @xmath290 km s@xmath22 @xcite . additionally , the dual agn hypothesis could be allowed for larger @xmath226s if the agn pairs are at small separations . for example",
    ", @xcite find in their simulations that large @xmath226s ( @xmath288 km s@xmath22 ) are often associated with dual agn at sub - kpc separations during pericentric passages . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath291 of our sample have @xmath292 km s@xmath22 , @xmath293 have @xmath294 km s@xmath22 , and @xmath295 have @xmath296 km s@xmath22 , with a maximum of @xmath297 km s@xmath22 . therefore , though a fraction of our sample exhibit @xmath226s higher than expected for dual agn , @xmath298 fall in the range expected for either kpc or sub - kpc separation agn pairs .",
    "we note that recent numerical simulations suggest dual activation of the smbhs following a galaxy merger is most likely to occur at separations smaller than 1 - 10 kpc @xcite . therefore , under this picture of dual activation , the correlation between eddington ratio and line - splitting seen in figure [ fig : ledd ] would naturally emerge for a sample of dual agn .",
    "as discussed in section [ redshifts ] , for dual agn with sufficiently large orbital velocities the broad emission line profiles may be significantly broader than expected if both components are type 1 agn . to test for such additional broadening ,",
    "we have compared the @xmath40  fwhms with those of , but find no evidence for systematically broadened @xmath40  compared to .",
    "furthermore , a k - s test does not indicate a significant difference between the @xmath40  fwhm distribution of our sample and that of the parent sample .",
    "however , we note that the mean @xmath255 value for our sample ( 4740 km s@xmath22 ) is slightly larger than that of the parent sample ( 4580 km s@xmath22 ) which is perhaps suggestive of additional @xmath40  broadening .",
    "in section [ sec : dynamics ] we tested a dynamical argument for the presence of dual agn in our sample .",
    "the results are generally consistent with the theoretical expectation for a binary , keplerian orbit ( figure [ fig : flux_shift ] ) . however , to understand the extent to which we can interpret this result , we must also strongly consider the role of alternative physical scenarios in producing such a correlation .",
    "first , we note that for both [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2 , based on the spearman rank test , the comparison sample shows slightly stronger correlations than for our sample .",
    "if this is an indication that the comparison sample shows stronger evidence for dual agn , it would be consistent with the notion that larger velocity - splittings are less likely to be associated with dual agn since our sample has larger velocity - splittings than the comparison sample .",
    "second , it is worth noting that the coefficients for the best - fit linear relations of [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2  are in disagreement .",
    "this is consistent with the correlation being produced by outflows ( or at least some of the sources experiencing outflows ) since the red component of [ ] @xmath2  would originate at a greater distance from the observer ( compared to the red [ ] @xmath1  component ) and therefore be even more obscured relative to the blue component ( figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) . in this case",
    ", the @xmath266 ratio should be even larger for [ ] @xmath2 , making the slope shallower as observed .    however , it is possible that if our sample contains some combination of outflows and dual agn then the outflows are responsible for deviations from the theoretical binary relation .",
    "for example , as discussed in section [ sec : dynamics ] many of the sources at the low @xmath266 , high @xmath269 portion of figure [ fig : flux_shift ] are offset above the theoretical relation .",
    "these sources may be more likely to represent outflows since they are trending in the same direction as the outflow relation . additionally , they have large @xmath269 ratios because the red component is near the systemic redshift , consistent with attenuation of the redshifted outflow component .",
    "lastly , the @xmath266 ratios are smaller , indicating that the red component is stronger , and the blue component is a lower luminosity , extended wing as is often seen in outflows and is seen a few of our sources . if these deviant sources are most likely to be outflows , then the remainder would be more consistent with the theoretical relation . additionally , the remainder would have a @xmath266 distribution consistent with @xmath267 , similar to the result of @xcite .",
    "we note that an additional source of scatter in the correlation could be due to stochastic accretion , such that the luminosity ratio does not accurately reflect the true mass ratio .",
    "this effect could be particularly significant when the smbhs are at larger separations when gas is less efficiently funneled to the nuclear regions .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath299 , the 3  fiber diameter of the sdss spectrograph corresponds to @xmath522 - 25 kpc , so that our sample may contain such early - stage mergers .      while the completeness of our selection process as discussed in section [ sec : offsets ]",
    "suggests that there is a significant number of double - peaked emitters that we have missed , especially at small @xmath226s , we can not correct for the true number since we do not know the shape of the underlying distribution",
    ". however , at the least we can use our [ ] -selected comparison sample to estimate what fraction of [ ] @xmath4  double - peaked emitters that we missed based on selection through [ ] @xmath1  or [ ] @xmath2 .",
    "of the 57 type 1 agn from @xcite , we could reliably measure double [ ] @xmath2  peaks for @xmath300 ( we note that this fraction is consistent with the comparison between our completeness estimates and those of @xcite in section [ completeness ] ) . based on this fraction , we arrive at a corrected number of 195 double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  sources and a double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  agn fraction of @xmath301 at @xmath0 .",
    "this fraction is likely to be a lower estimate because the double - peaked [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2  lines of the [ ] -selected sample were not selected in exactly the same way ( i.e. we had a prior knowledge of the double - peaked separation ) .",
    "therefore , the double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  agn fraction at @xmath0 is likely to be larger , potentially making it consistent with the fraction of @xmath302 found by @xcite at @xmath3 .    to actually estimate the expected fraction of dual agn in our sample we need the true fractions of double - peaked agn and of dual agn out of all agn at @xmath0 ,",
    "neither of which are known .",
    "however , we may make several reasonable assumptions that provide a rough estimate .",
    "first , in order to determine the true fraction of double - peaked agn out of all agn at @xmath0 , we need to correct for both our selection incompleteness and random projection effects .",
    "this fraction was estimated by @xcite in which they determined that the fraction of detectable double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  agn is only @xmath303 of the actual number of agn with double [ ] @xmath4  components . correcting our estimated double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  fraction of @xmath304 yields a ` true ' double [ ] @xmath4  fraction of @xmath52.5% at @xmath0 .",
    "the influence of inclination and phase angle for selection of dual agn through double - peaked emission line profiles was also investigated by @xcite in which they found that , at a phase angle of @xmath305 , we miss at least 50% of all agn with double emission components .",
    "we note that this 50% correction is a lower limit since it does not account for instrumental resolution , and that applying additional corrections based on our completeness estimates would likely make the correction estimated in this manner similar to that of @xcite .",
    "finally , if we take the dual agn fraction at @xmath306 to be @xmath307 @xcite , then we estimate the fraction of dual agn out of double - peaked agn at @xmath0 to be @xmath308 .",
    "this fraction is several times smaller than the results of @xcite ( 4.5 - 12% ) and @xcite ( @xmath309 ) which were obtained from follow - up observations of double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  agn .",
    "however , the difference can be attributed , at least in part , to the small expected number of dual agn at @xmath306 estimated by @xcite which is due to the redshift evolution of galaxy morphology in their analysis which yields more late - type galaxies with smaller initial smbh masses at higher redshift .",
    "a direct test of this through follow - up observations is therefore crucial in understanding the frequency of galaxy mergers at redshifts @xmath13 and their role in agn triggering .",
    "for example , nir spectroscopy will be capable of accessing the redshifted [ ] @xmath4  emission line for sources in our sample , allowing for a direct comparison with the @xmath3 samples of double - peaked agn .",
    "this was done with the @xmath12 dual agn candidate cxoxbj142607.6 + 353351 in @xcite which was initially selected through double - peaked [ ] / [ ]  but for which follow - up nir spectroscopy provided access to [ ] @xmath4 .",
    "the additional spatial information of [ ] @xmath4  provided by 2d longslit spectroscopy would enable one to determine if any of these sources are strong dual agn candidates .",
    "follow - up high - resolution imaging , such as radio observations , would be capable of resolving the two agn cores , if present .",
    "we have compiled a sample of 131 quasars at @xmath299 which show double emission line components in either of the high - ionization narrow lines [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this search was to identify high - redshift analogs of the double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  sources found in several previous studies .",
    "those double - peaked [ ] @xmath4  sources are believed to represent complex gas kinematics , large - scale outflows , or in a few cases dual agn . given the increased frequency of galaxy mergers at higher redshifts and their importance in models of galaxy evolution , we have investigated these phenomena at higher redshifts using our sample , with the following conclusions :    * there is a clear bias towards selecting double - peaks with large velocity - splittings .",
    "this bias was made apparent by our comparison of the velocity - offsets of the blue and red components in our sample to those of [ ] -selected samples , and it is corroborated by the results of our completeness simulations .",
    "this selection bias is not surprising , and it is imposed by the relatively weaker intensities of [ ] @xmath1  and [ ] @xmath2  compared to [ ] @xmath4 .",
    "* we have found two results suggesting that both the blue and red systems are influenced by kinematics in the nlr .",
    "first , the line - widths of both the blue and red components are strongly correlated with the line - splittings , suggesting a common origin .",
    "second , we find that the individual offsets for both the ` blue ' and ` red ' systems are positively correlated with the quasar eddington ratio , suggesting that the smbh accretion rate and therefore the radiation pressure is responsible for driving the line - offsets in the blueward direction for both line components .",
    "* we find evidence suggesting that the observed kinematics are strongest in the blue systems .",
    "this is suggested because the blue systems have larger velocity shifts from the quasar redshift , those velocity offsets show the strongest correlations with the eddington ratio , and the blue systems show the highest degree of ionization stratification .",
    "this further suggests that the red outflowing components are generally more obscured .",
    "* we have found that a significant fraction ( @xmath310 ) are radio loud , compared to the @xmath311 radio loud fraction of the parent sample .",
    "taken together , the previous conclusions paint a picture in which the blue systems originate in a portion of the nlr much closer to the agn where they are accelerated by the accretion disk radiation pressure or radio jets to high velocities .",
    "this explains the large blueshifts , the stronger correlation with eddington ratio and the pronounced ionization stratification .",
    "the red system originates further from the agn where it is not accelerated to the high velocities of the blue system but is nevertheless close enough so it s bulk velocity offset is also influenced by the agn radiation pressure .",
    "this explains the smaller velocity offsets , the much weaker correlation with eddington ratio , and the relatively less pronounced ionization stratification compared to the blue systems .",
    "a generalized schematic of this scenario in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "the enhanced radio loud",
    "fraction relative to the parent sample also suggests that radio jets may be another mechanism which is capable of accelerating the nlr clouds to produce the line offsets .",
    "this sample can be used to study outflows from luminous agn at relatively high redshifts when agn feedback may have been an important factor in the growth of massive galaxies .",
    "there are several interesting results which leave open the possibility for dual agn in the sample .",
    "in particular , several of our correlations can be thought of as consistent with the dual agn scenario , and even suggest that the sample is likely to include dual agn : +    * the correlation between velocity - splitting and eddington ratio , while consistent with the picture of radiatively - driven outflows , could plausibly be consistent with orbiting smbh pairs in which enhanced accretion is more likely to occur at smaller separations where the smbh orbital velocities will be largest .",
    "* we have found that a subset of our sample ( @xmath283 ) are consistent with no measurable ionization stratification between [ ] @xmath1   and [ ] @xmath2 , similar to other dual agn and strong candidate dual agn .",
    "* we have found that our sample shows a correlation between the velocity - offset ratio and the luminosity ratio of the blue and red components .",
    "this correlation is broadly consistent with the theoretical expectation for a binary , keplerian orbit , though our sample seems to be systematically offset above the relation .",
    "we have shown how this deviation could be produced in a sample which includes a combination of agn outflows and dual agn . +",
    "* we have estimated the fraction of dual agn out of double - peaked agn that we expect at @xmath0 , finding a fraction ( 2% ) which is smaller than that estimated at lower redshifts .",
    "however , we caution that a significant - and perhaps the primary - reason for this lower fraction is the small estimated number of high redshift dual agn that we adopt .",
    "follow - up nir observations to access the [ ] @xmath4   line in our sources would allow for a direct comparison with the [ ] @xmath4   velocity and spatial profiles of the @xmath312 samples , allowing for a more robust assessment of the origin of the double - peaks in the high - ionization narrow emission lines .",
    "therefore , this sample represents an initial step toward extending the study of double - peaked emission line agn to higher redshifts .",
