    "it is well and long ago known that at @xmath12 gev@xmath6 the @xmath13 differential cross - section grows with energy . on the contrary , at @xmath14",
    "gev@xmath6 they clearly decrease[1 ] .",
    "recent lhc data confirm these both trends .",
    "this circumstance may impose a speculation that there could exist between these two regions of @xmath15 a point @xmath16 where differential cross - section does nt change with energy at all .",
    "the stationary points of the differential cross - sections were discussed _ en passant _ many years ago in refs . [ 2],[3 ] but did nt find any conceptual development .",
    "we , thus , assume that there exists a fixed ( energy independent ) point @xmath17 where    @xmath18/ds \\approx 0 $ ]    at `` high enough energies '' .",
    "the thorough inspection of the available data shows that such a point seems to exist indeed . at fig.1 the energy evolution of @xmath19 at various fixed values of @xmath15",
    "is presented .",
    "fig.1 bears an evidently qualitative character .",
    "we believe , however , that it demonstrates our point quite well .",
    "certainly , the exact value of the stationary point @xmath16 , which we believe at the moment is near @xmath20 gev@xmath6 , may slightly change after more detailed analysis . as we can see below ,",
    "the effect in question is possible only for the processes with asymptotically growing cross - sections .",
    "that is why we have considered the data starting from the isr where @xmath21 begin to grow .    formally , it is easy to invent a model amplitude which exhibit such a property .",
    "let us consider a single regge - pole amplitude of the form @xmath22 . if the regge - trajectory @xmath23 intersect the line @xmath24 at some negative @xmath25 then the differential cross - section defined by such an amplitude is stationary at @xmath26 .",
    "this is possible for the pomeron trajectory only with @xmath27 .",
    "however , there are arguments that the pomeron trajectory is non - linear and never intersects the level @xmath24 at negative @xmath15 [ 4 ] .",
    "sure , the genuine scattering amplitude is much more complicated than this simplistic model . notwithstanding the plethora of `` realistic '' models which describe the data with varied success , we estimate the differential cross - section at the stationary point with help of a simple quasi - classical expression    @xmath28 .",
    "uncertainty relations imply that    @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "hence , we get the estimate of the differential cross - section at the stationary point    @xmath31    after having inspected the available data we choose , as a trial value of @xmath16 , the value @xmath32 gev@xmath33",
    ". then    @xmath34 .",
    "it is bizarre that such a primitive evaluation lies so close to the data which we estimate at the level @xmath35 [ 5]-[8 ] ( c.f .",
    "let us rewrite the differential cross - section in the form    @xmath36 , $ ]    where    @xmath37    and    @xmath38)/dt $ ]    is the local slope .",
    "existence of the stationary point means that at @xmath39 , which we take as before at @xmath32 gev@xmath6    @xmath40 = 7.5 \\mathrm{\\ , mb}/\\mathrm{gev}^{2 } .$ ]    this quantity is , by our assumption , energy independent therefore the growth of @xmath41 is to be compensated by the decrease of @xmath42 .",
    "taking use of the mean value theorem we have    @xmath43 .$ ]    we obtain    @xmath44/({-t_{\\ast } } ) , $ ]    or    @xmath45 , $ ]    where @xmath46 .",
    "to estimate @xmath47 we take use of the parametrization suggested in [ 9 ] which gives @xmath48 at @xmath49 tev and @xmath50 .    from these values",
    "we can envisage that    @xmath51 .",
    "we have shown , at a tentative level , that it is quite probable that there exists a stationary , energy independent value @xmath52 gev@xmath33 where the value of @xmath53 remains constant with the energy growth .",
    "we have some reasons to believe that one another stationary point lies near @xmath54 gev@xmath33 .",
    "it seems natural to investigate other channels : @xmath55 . at the moment we have no physical explanation of the phenomenon considered above .",
