    "1 , it is evident that as the dispersion ( frequency ) becomes larger ( smaller ) , it also becomes easier for @xmath20 to go over the classical potential barrier . there is an inevitable restriction of the gaussian approximation . in the presence of leaking into the right",
    "well the wave - function can not be described by the gaussian . due to this restriction",
    ", we can not effectively describe tunnelling process . to remove this restriction",
    ", one needs double gaussian ( appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite ) or other approximations , which is out of scope of the present paper .",
    "if @xmath67 becomes time - dependent , the dynamics can not be understood simply by the effective potential , and the equations of motion should be considered explicitly .    as an explicit dynamical example",
    ", we consider the slow rolling ( @xmath82 for @xmath83 ) potential . the equipotential curves are shown in fig .",
    "an interesting features of this effective potential is that the unstable equilibrium point at @xmath80 disappears .    to understand the dynamics of this system , we write down the equation of motion for @xmath84 explicitly : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is given by eq .",
    "( [ veff:1 ] ) .",
    "let a gaussian wave - function prepared at @xmath80 with velocity @xmath87 starts to evolve . in the case of slow rollover , the evolution",
    "is divided into three phases ; the slow - rolling , rolling , and oscillating phases .",

    "@xmath88 , @xmath73 increases slowly until @xmath89^{1/6}$ ] , which is the variational minimum of the potential in @xmath73 at @xmath80 , because @xmath90 and @xmath91 . this time ( @xmath92 ) ,",

    "( [ a : sr ] ) , which gives @xmath101 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath96 is given by the sum of the time taken by @xmath93 to increase to the variational value , @xmath92 , and the variational time for the remaining part of @xmath20 , @xmath102 , which will be shown shortly .",
    "the variational effective potential is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 satisfies @xmath105 therefore , in the variational approach , @xmath106 and the duration of slow - rolling phase is @xmath107 .",
    "note that the duration ( @xmath108 or @xmath109 ) of the slow - rolling phase in both of the scenario is considerably larger than the time determined by the variational method @xmath102 .    for @xmath110 , the wave - packet runs into the rolling phase .",
    "in this phase , the equation of motion becomes too difficult to get exact answer without numerical analysis . in this paper",
    "we simply outline the evolution without giving explicit solution .",
    "if @xmath111 is a constant for @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is smaller than @xmath114 , one gets @xmath115 from the elliptic integral @xmath116 where @xmath117 .",
    "however , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ ddx:2 ] ) , @xmath73 grows quickly during the period @xmath118 , which lasts until @xmath119 .",
    "once @xmath73 or @xmath20 grows enough and fails to satisfies the condition , @xmath118 , @xmath73 goes into the oscillating phase .",
    "after @xmath20 reaches to the potential minima , it starts to oscillate around the minimum of the potential , which is the last stage .",
    "we do not restrict to the slow rolling case in the calculation of this stage .",
    "we simply assume that the final wave - packet resides around the true vacuum , which is determined by @xmath120 . for a slow rolling potential",
    ", there is a unique point which satisfies this condition .",
    "now , we series expand the potential around the true vacuum : @xmath121 the solutions for the equation of motion for this @xmath122 are given by two frequency series expansion in general : @xmath123,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is determined from the differential equation  ( [ ddx:2 ] ) up to its scale , and @xmath125 is the normal mode frequencies of @xmath126 .",

    "we now turn our attention to the calculation of @xmath135 .",

    "explicitly , we have shown that the invariant annihilation operator can be expressed as a linear combination of the creation and annihilation operators of true vacuum .",
