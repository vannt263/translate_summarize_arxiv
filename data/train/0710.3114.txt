    "what has become astec started its development in cambridge around 1974 .",
    "the initial goal was to provide an improved equilibrium model for investigations of solar stability , following earlier work by @xcite .",
    "however , with the initial evidence for solar oscillations and the prospects for helioseismology @xcite the goals were soon extended to provide models for comparison with the observed frequencies . given the expected accuracy of these frequencies , and the need to use them to uncover subtle features of the solar interior , more emphasis was placed on numerical accuracy than was perhaps common at the time .",
    "the code drew some inspiration from the eggleton stellar evolution code @xcite , which had been used previously , but the development was fully independent of that code .",
    "an early description of the code was given by @xcite , with further extensive details provided by @xcite ; many aspects of this still stand and will only be summarized here . with the increasing quality and extent of the helioseismic data the code",
    "was further developed , to allow for more realistic physics ; a major improvement was the inclusion of diffusion and settling @xcite .",
    "this led to the so - called model  s of the sun @xcite which has found extensive use as reference for helioseismic investigations and which at the time provided reasonably up - to - date representations of the physics of the solar interior . in parallel",
    ", extensions have been made to the code to consider the evolution of stars other than the sun ; these include the treatment of convective cores and core overshoot , attempts to model red - giant evolution and the inclusion of helium burning .",
    "this development is still very much under way .    for use in asteroseismic",
    "fitting a version of the code has also been developed in the form of a subroutine with a reasonably simple calling structure which also includes the computation of adiabatic oscillation frequencies as part of the computation .",
    "the combined package is available as a single tar file , making the installation relatively straightforward , and the code has been successfully implemented on a variety of platforms .",
    "nevertheless , it is sufficiently complex that a general release is probably not advisable .",
    "the equations of stellar structure and evolution are written with @xmath0 as independent variable , where @xmath1 is logarithm to base 10 ; here @xmath2 is the mass fraction where @xmath3 is the mass interior to the point considered and @xmath4 is the photospheric mass of the star , defining the photosphere as the point where the temperature is equal to the effective temperature . the equations are written on the form @xmath5 here @xmath6 is distance to the centre , @xmath7 is density , @xmath8 is pressure , @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 is temperature , @xmath11 is the luminosity at @xmath6 , @xmath12 is the energy generation rate per unit mass , @xmath13 is enthalpy per unit mass , @xmath14 is the mass fraction of element @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the rate of change of @xmath14 due to nuclear reactions , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the diffusion and settling coefficients for element @xmath15 . also , the value of @xmath19 depends on whether the region is convectively stable or not . in the case of a convectively stable region , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radiation density constant , @xmath22 is the speed of light , and @xmath23 is the opacity .",
    "the factor @xmath24 is discussed following eq .",
    "[ eq : ttau ] below .",
    "the calculation of the temperature gradient in convective regions is discussed in section  [ sec : conv ] . in eq .",
    "[ eq : dif ] the derivatives with respect to @xmath3 should obviously be expressed in terms of derivatives with respect to @xmath25 .    as discussed below ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the diffusion velocity on the form @xmath26 then eqs  [ eq : dif ] can be written as @xmath27 here @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the natural logarithm .",
    "( in the code @xmath30 is used as variable . ) for elements where diffusion and settling are ignored the original form , eq .",
    "[ eq : dif ] , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 set to zero is obviously used .",
    "the centre , @xmath31 , is obviously a singular point of eqs [ eq : radius ]  [ eq : energy ] .",
    "as discussed in considerable detail by @xcite , this is treated by expanding the variables to second significant order in @xmath6 to obtain the required conditions at the innermost point in the numerical solution .",
    "these are written in the form of expressions of the @xmath3 and @xmath11 at the innermost mesh point in terms of the other variables .",
    "the treatment of diffusion and settling has yet to be included consistently in this expansion ; currently , conditions are imposed that essentially set the @xmath32 to zero at the innermost meshpoint .",
    "the outer boundary of the solution of the full evolution equations is taken to be at the photosphere , defined as the point where @xmath33 , the effective temperature .",
    "consequently an obvious boundary condition is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . to obtain a second condition ,",
    "a expression is assumed for the dependence of @xmath10 on optical depth @xmath36 , conveniently written as @xmath37^{1/4 } \\ ; . \\label{eq : ttau}\\ ] ] based on this the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , on the form @xmath38 can be integrated assuming , currently , a constant gravitational acceleration @xmath39 .",
    "the surface boundary condition @xmath40 based on an approximate treatment of the outer parts of the atmosphere , is applied at the top of the atmosphere , @xmath41 , typically taken to be @xmath42 .",
    "the boundary condition is obtained by equating the pressure resulting from integrating eq .",
    "[ eq : atmohydro ] to the pressure in the interior solution .    the @xmath43 relation and eq .",

    "[ eq : radgrad ] .",
    "as indicated in eqs [ eq : radius ]  [ eq : dif ] and [ eq : difx ] , [ eq : dify ] , the dependent variables on the left - hand sides of the equations are expressed in terms of the set @xmath46 here the index @xmath15 runs over all the abundances considered , whereas the index @xmath47 runs over those elements for which diffusion is included . in the solution of the equations ,",
    "the computation of the right - hand sides is the heaviest part of the calculation and hence needs to be optimized in terms of efficiency . as discussed below",
    ", this may involve expressing the thermodynamic state in terms of a different set of variables @xmath48 , related to the @xmath49 by a non - singular transformation .",
    "using also the reformulation , eqs [ eq : difx ] and [ eq : dify ] , of the diffusion equation , the combined set of stellar - evolution equations consists of equations of one of the following three types : @xmath50 the equations of type iii are obviously relevant to the evolution of abundances of elements for which diffusion is not taken into account .",
    "to this must be added the transformation @xmath51 in practice , @xmath52 for @xmath53 ; the choice of @xmath54 depends on the specific equation of state considered .",
    "the equations are solved on the interval @xmath55 $ ] , with boundary conditions that can be expressed as @xmath56    the equations are solved by means of the newton - raphson - kantorovich scheme ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the stellar - evolution context known as the henyey scheme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we introduce a mesh @xmath57 in @xmath25 and consider two timesteps @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where the solution is assumed to be known at timestep @xmath58 .",
    "also , we introduce @xmath60 with a similar notation for @xmath61 , as well as for quantities at timestep @xmath59 .",
    "then eqs [ eq : typei ]  [ eq : typeiii ] are replaced by the following difference equations : @xmath62   ( z_i^{n+1,s+1}-z_i^{n+1,s})/\\delta t^s \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{i=1}^i \\left [ \\theta_p \\lambda_{pi}^{n , s+1 } + ( 1 - \\theta_p ) \\lambda_{pi}^{n , s}\\right ] ( z_i^{n , s+1}-z_i^{n , s})/\\delta t^s \\large\\ } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad n = 1 , \\ldots , n-1 \\ ; ; \\quad p = i_1 + 1 , \\ldots i_1 + i_2 \\ ; , \\label{eq : dtypeii } \\\\ & & y_u^{n , s+1 } - y_u^{n , s } = \\delta t^s \\left [ \\theta_u f_u^{n , s+1 } + ( 1 - \\theta_u ) f_u^{n , s } \\right ] \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad n = 1 , \\ldots , n \\ ; ; \\quad u = i_1 + i_2 + 1 , \\ldots i_1+i_2+i_3 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : dtypeiii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath63 and @xmath64 . also , the parameters @xmath65 allow setting the centralization of the difference scheme in time , @xmath66 corresponding to time - centred differences and @xmath67 to a fully implicit scheme .",
    "the former clearly provides higher precision but potentially less stability than the latter ; thus time - centred differences are typically used for processes occurring on a slow timescale , such as the change in the hydrogen abundance , whereas the implicit scheme is used , e.g. , for the time derivatives in the energy equation where the characteristic timescale is much shorter than the evolution time and hence short compared with the typical step @xmath68 in time .",
    "the algebraic equations [ eq : dtypei ]  [ eq : dtypeiii ] , together with the boundary conditions , eqs  [ eq : bca ] and [ eq : bcb ] , are solved using newton - raphson iteration , to determine the solution @xmath69 at the new time step ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "given a trial solution @xmath70 the equations are linearized in terms of corrections @xmath71 and the resulting linear equations are solved using forwards elimination and backsubstitution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this process is repeated with the thus corrected solution as trial , until convergence .",
    "the initial zams model is assumed to be static and with a prescribed chemical composition .",
    "thus in this case only eqs  [ eq : dtypei ] are solved .",
    "time evolution is started with a very small @xmath68 for the initial non - zero timestep .",
    "the number @xmath72 of meshpoints is kept fixed during the evolution , but the distribution of points is varied according to the change in the structure of the model .",
    "the mesh algorithm is based on the first - derivative stretching introduced by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , taking into account the variation of several relevant variables . an early version of the implementation was described by @xcite , but this has subsequently been substantially extended and is still under development . in particular , a dense distribution of points is set up near the boundaries of convection zones , although so far points are not adjusted so as to be exactly at the edges of the zones . after completing the solution at each timestep the new mesh is determined and the model transferred to this mesh using , in general , third - order interpolation ; linear interpolation is used near boundaries of convective regions and in other regions where the variation of the variables is not smooth .",
    "having computed model at timestep @xmath59 the next timestep is determined from the change in the model between timesteps @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; this involves a fairly complex algorithm limiting the change in , e.g. , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 at fixed @xmath3 . to compensate for the fairly crude treatment of the composition in a possible convective core",
    ", the change of @xmath75 in such a core is given higher weight than the general change in @xmath75 .",
    "the algorithm correctly ensures that very short steps in time are taken in rapid evolutionary phases . in typical simple calculations , assuming @xmath76 to be in nuclear equilibrium , roughly 35 ( 100 ) timesteps are needed to reach the end of central hydrogen burning in models without ( with ) a convective core , and 100 ( 200 ) steps to reach the base of the red - giant branch .",
    "calculations with more complex physics or requiring higher numerical precision obviously require a substantially higher number of timesteps .",
    "evolution up the red giant branch typically requires a large number of timesteps owing to the rapid changes at fixed @xmath3 in the hydrogen - burning shell although the timestep algorithm has options to reduce the weight given to this region .",
    "as the code has developed over the years a number of options have been included for the microphysics , although not all of these have been kept up to date or properly verified . as a general principle ,",
    "the code has been written in a modular way , so that replacing , for example , routines for equation of state or opacity has been relatively straightforward .",
    "it should be noted that the use of a different set @xmath77 of dependent variables on the right - hand side of the equations yields additional flexibility in the replacement of aspects of the physics .",
    "@xcite provided a review of the treatment of the equation of state and opacity in stellar modelling .",
    "a review of nuclear reactions in the solar interior , of relevance in the more general stellar case , was provided by @xcite .",
    "the original version of the code used the @xcite equation of state and that remains an often used option . in this case",
    "@xmath78 , where @xmath79 , introduced by eggleton et al . and related to the electron - degeneracy parameter , is used as one of the thermodynamic variables ; this allows explicit calculation of partial ionization and hence a very efficient evaluation of the required thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the formulation also includes a crude but thermodynamically consistent implementation of ` pressure ionization ' ( which actually results mainly as a result of the high density in deep stellar interiors ) which provides apparently reasonable results .",
    "the fact that the whole calculation is done explicitly makes it entirely feasible , if somewhat cumbersome , to evaluate analytical derivatives . up",
    "to second derivatives of pressure , density and enthalpy are provided in a fully consistent manner , whereas third derivatives , required for the central boundary condition , assume full ionization .",
    "partial electron degeneracy is included in the form of expansions that cover all levels of degeneracy and relativistic effects .    as an upgrade to the basic eff formulation @xcite",
    "included coulomb effects , in the debye - hckel formulation , following @xcite ; unlike some earlier treatments of the coulomb effect this ensured that thermodynamic consistency was maintained ; as a result , a substantial effect was found also on the degrees of ionization of hydrogen and helium , resulting from the change in the chemical potential .",
    "the computation of the coulomb effects consequently requires some iteration , even if the eff variables are used , and hence some increase in computing time .",
    "however , the resulting equation of state captures major aspects of the more complex forms discussed below .",
    "more realistic descriptions of the equation of state require computations that are currently too complex to be included directly in stellar evolution calculations .",
    "thus interpolation in pre - computed tables is required .",
    "the first such set to be included was the so - called mhd equation of state @xcite , based on the _ chemical picture _ where the thermodynamic state is obtained through minimization of an expression for the free energy including a number of contributions .",
    "application of this formulation to a comparison with observed solar oscillation frequencies showed a very substantial improvement in the agreement between the sun and the model @xcite .",
    "further updates to the mhd equation of state have been made but they have so far not been implemented in astec .",
    "an alternative description is provided by the so - called opal equation of state @xcite , based on the _ physical picture _ where the thermodynamic state is obtained from an activity expansion .",
    "this has been the preferred equation of state for solar modelling with astec , used , e.g. , in model  s.    the early versions of both the mhd and opal equations of state suffered from a neglect of relativistic effects in the treatment of the electrons @xcite .",
    "this has since been corrected @xcite .",
    "also , the opal formulation suffered from inconsistencies between some of the variables provided ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; effects of the inconsistency on the computation of adiabatic oscillations are discussed by @xcite .",
    "this has been improved in the latest version of the opal equation of state , which has also been implemented in astec .",
    "interpolation in the opal tables uses quadratic interpolation in @xmath7 , @xmath10 and @xmath75 .",
    "typically , a single representative value of @xmath80 is used , even in cases with diffusion and settling of heavy elements , although the code has the option of using linear interpolation between two sets of tables with different @xmath80 .",
    "the early treatment of the opacities used tables from @xcite and @xcite with an interpolation scheme developed by @xcite .",
    "a major improvement was the implementation of the opal opacity tables @xcite . with various updates of the tables",
    "this has since been the basis for the opacity calculation in the code .",
    "the most recent tables , including a variety of mixtures of the heavy elements , are based on the computations by @xcite .",
    "atmospheric opacities must be supplied separately ; here tables by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite have been used , with a smooth matching to the interior tables at @xmath81 .",
    "electron conduction may be included based on the tables of @xcite .",
    "interpolation in the opal tables is carried out with schemes developed by g. houdek ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the tables are provided as functions of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "for interpolation in @xmath84 two schemes are available .",
    "one uses a minimum - norm algorithm with interpolating function defined in a piecewise fashion over triangles in the @xmath85 plane @xcite .",
    "the second scheme uses birational splines @xcite . in practice",
    "the latter scheme has been used for most of the model calculations with astec .",
    "interpolation in @xmath75 and @xmath86 is carried out using the univariate scheme of @xcite .",
    "note that the relative composition of @xmath80 is assumed to be fixed ; thus differential settling or changes in heavy - element composition resulting from nuclear burning are not taken into account .",
    "the code includes flexible ways of modifying the opacity , to allow tests of the sensitivity of the model to such modifications .",
    "an extensive survey of the response of solar models to localized opacity changes , specified as functions of @xmath74 , was made by @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the nuclear reaction rates is based on the usual approximations to the reaction integrals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using a variety of coefficients @xcite .",
    "electron screening is computed in the @xcite approximation .",
    "electron capture by @xmath87 is treated according to @xcite .",
    "the nuclear network is relatively limited and is one of the points where the code needs improvement .",
    "this is to some extent a heritage of its origin as a solar - modelling code , as well as a consequence of the fact that pre - main - sequence evolution is not computed . in the pp chains",
    "@xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath87 are assumed to be in nuclear equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "the code has the option of following the evolution of @xmath76 , although in many calculations it is sufficient to assume @xmath76 to be in nuclear equilibrium . to simulate the evolution of the @xmath76 abundance @xmath90 during the pre - main - sequence phase the initial zero - age main - sequence mode assumes the @xmath90 that would have resulted from evolution over a specified period @xmath91 at constant conditions , as described by @xcite but generalized to allow a non - zero initial abundance .",
    "a typical value is @xmath92yr .    in the cno cycle",
    "the cn part is assumed to be in nuclear equilibrium and controlled by the rate of the @xmath93 reaction .",
    "in addition , the reactions @xmath94 and @xmath95 are included ; these play an important role in ensuring the gradual conversion of @xmath96 to @xmath97 and hence increasing the importance of the cn cycle .",
    "this part of the cycle is assumed to be fully controlled by the @xmath98 reaction and the branching ratio between the @xmath99 and @xmath100 reactions .",
    "helium burning has been included in the code using the expressions of @xcite , and including also the reaction @xmath101 .",
    "however , the code is unable to deal with helium ignition in a helium flash .",
    "thus models with helium burning are restricted to masses in excess of @xmath102 where ignition takes place in a relatively quiet manner . also , as in cases of hydrogen burning ( cf .",
    "[ sec : conv ] ) , the treatment of semiconvection that may be required in this phase has not been implemented .      diffusion and settling",
    "are treated in the approximations proposed by @xcite , with revisions kindly provided by proffitt .",
    "for completeness i give the complete expressions in appendix a. if included , diffusion of heavy elements assumes that all elements behave as fully ionized @xmath96 ; this is a reasonable approximation in the solar case where the outer convection zone is relatively deep , but becomes increasingly questionable in more massive main - sequence stars .",
    "here , also , effects of selective radiative levitation should be taken into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; there are no current plans to do so in the code . various approximations to turbulent diffusion",
    "can be included , partly inspired by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the code has the option to suppress settling in the outer parts of the star , to allow modelling of diffusion and settling in the cores of relatively massive stars where otherwise settling beneath the thin outer convection zone would result in a complete depletion of the surface layers of elements heavier than hydrogen .    at present , diffusion and settling",
    "is coupled to nuclear evolution in the consistent manner of eq .",
    "[ eq : dif ] only for helium . for the remaining elements taking part in the nuclear network diffusion",
    "is neglected .",
    "correcting this deficiency is an obvious priority .",
    "the temperature gradient in convection zones is usually computed using the @xcite and @xcite version of mixing - length theory ; for completeness , the expressions used are provided in appendix b. the mixing length is a constant multiple , @xmath103 , of the pressure scale height @xmath104 . in addition , emulations of the @xcite formulation , established by @xcite , can be used .",
    "convective regions can obviously , at least in stars that are not extremely evolved , be assumed to have uniform composition .",
    "this can in principle be achieved by including a very high diffusion coefficient in such regions . in astec",
    "this is used in convective envelopes , ensuring that they are chemically uniform .",
    "the treatment of convective cores remains a concern and an area of active development , however .",
    "given the lack of a proper treatment of the diffusion of all elements an explicit calculation of the chemical evolution is required .",
    "this is characterized by the ( assumed homogeneous ) abundances @xmath105 of the elements .",
    "the rate of change of these abundances can be written @xmath106 + { 1 \\over q_{\\rm cc } } \\tilde y_k(x_{\\rm cc } ) \\ ; ; \\label{eq : ccoreab}\\ ] ] here @xmath107 is the mass fraction in the convective core , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is the reaction rate averaged over the convective core . in the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : ccoreab ] @xmath110 is evaluated just outside the core ; this term only has an effect if there is a composition discontinuity at the edge of the core , i.e. , if the core is growing and diffusion is neglected .",
    "finally , the term in @xmath111 is obviously only included in cases where diffusion is taken into account .    in models with a growing convective core , and neglecting diffusion ,",
    "a discontinuity is set up in the hydrogen abundance at the edge of the core ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : rgrad ] ) .",
    "this situation arises in intermediate - mass stars ( with masses up to around @xmath112 ) where the gradual conversion during evolution of @xmath96 into @xmath97 causes an increase in the importance of the cno cycle in the energy generation ( for more massive stars the cno cycle dominates even with the initial @xmath97 abundance ) .",
    "since pressure and temperature are obviously continuous , there is also a discontinuity in density and opacity @xmath23 , leading also to a jump in the radiative temperature gradient @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : radgrad ] ) .",
    "since @xmath23 increases with @xmath75 and @xmath7 , while @xmath7 decreases with increasing @xmath75 , it is not _ a priori _ clear how @xmath23 and hence @xmath113 react at the discontinuity ; in practice the common behaviour is that @xmath113 increases going from the value of @xmath75 in the convective core to the higher value in the radiative region just outside it .",
    "this raises the question of the definition of convective instability : if the border of the convective core is defined using the composition of the core , the region immediately outside the core is therefore convectively unstable . as a consequence , astec defines the border of the convective core by the abundance in the radiative region , leaving a small _ convectively stable _ region just below the border , which nevertheless is assumed to be fully mixed in the standard astec implementation .",
    "this may be regarded as an example of semiconvection , of somewhat uncertain physical consequences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a different scheme ,",
    "now under implementation , is discussed in section  [ sec : develop ] .",
    "various options exist for the treatment of convective overshoot .",
    "simple formulations involve compositionally fully mixed overshoot regions from the convective core or convective envelope , over a distance @xmath114 below a convective envelope , or @xmath115 above a convective core , where @xmath116 is the radius of the core .",
    "the overshoot region may be taken to be either adiabatically or radiatively stratified .",
    "a more elaborate treatment of overshoot from a convective envelope has been implemented , following @xcite , where various forms of the temperature gradient can be specified , still assuming the overshoot region to be fully mixed .",
    "this is being extended to emulate the overshoot simulations by @xcite .",
    "when computing models of the present sun it is important to adjust the input parameters such as to obtain a model that precisely matches the observed solar radius , luminosity and ratio @xmath117 between the abundances of heavy elements and hydrogen , at the present age of the sun .",
    "this is achieved by adjusting the initial hydrogen and heavy - element abundances @xmath118 and @xmath119 as well as the mixing - length parameter @xmath120 ( or another parameter characterizing the treatment of convection ) . in astec",
    "the iteration to determine these parameters is carried out automatically , making the computation of solar models , and the exploration of the consequences of modifications to the input physics , rather convenient .",
    "the astec code has grown over three decades , with a substantial number of different uses along the way .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the structure of the code as well as in the large number of input parameters and flags that control its different options .",
    "these are provided in an input file , in many cases using simply the defaults provided in the source of the code .",
    "also , several different executables can be produced , reflecting partly the evolution of the code and partly different versions of the physics , in particular the equation of state and the opacity , as well as the option to include diffusion and settling . to make the code somewhat more user - friendly ,",
    "scripts have been made which allow simply to change a few key parameters , such as mass , heavy - element abundance and number of timesteps , by editing templates of the input files .",
    "consequently , the code has been used with success by several users , including students and postdocs at the university of aarhus .",
    "in addition to summary output files listing global properties of the models in the evolution sequence , output of detailed models , on the full mesh of the calculation , can be made in three different forms : the so - called emdl files , including just the variables @xmath77 actually used in the calculation , as well as a complete listing of the input parameters , to provide full documentation of the calculation ; the amdl files which provide the variables needed for the aarhus adiabatic pulsation code ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and the gong files , giving an extensive set of variables for use in further investigations of the models or plotting .",
    "a convenient way to use the code , without overloading storage systems with the large gong files , is to store the full emdl file and subsequently read in models at selected timesteps , to output the corresponding amdl or gong files .",
    "for asteroseismology it is evidently crucial to compute oscillation frequencies of the computed models .",
    "the full calculation of frequencies , for given input parameters to the evolution calculation , often needs to be carried out as part of a larger computation , e.g. , when fitting observed frequencies to determine the properties of the model . to facilitate",
    "this a version of the code has been made where the evolution calculation and all parts of the adiabatic oscillation calculation is carried out by a single subroutine call , with internal passing of the intermediate products of the calculation .",
    "this subroutine can then be called by , for example , a fitting code .",
    "an example of such use is the application of the code in genetic - algorithm fitting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , under development by t. metcalfe , high altitude observatory .",
    "the code has been implemented on a variety of platforms and appears to be relatively robust . to simplify the installation ,",
    "a complete tar package including all the required files , with a setup script and a full makefile , has been established .",
    "however , the complexity of the code and the lack of adequate documentation makes it unrealistic to release it for general use .",
    "from the preceding presentation it is obvious that there are significant deficiencies in astec , and work is ongoing to correct them .",
    "a fairly trivial issue is the restricted nuclear network and the failure to include all elements undergoing nuclear reactions in the full diffusive treatment .",
    "rather more serious problems concern the treatment of the borders of convective regions ; even though this obviously also involves open issues of a basic physical nature , the code should at least aim at treating these regions in a numerically consistent , even if perhaps not physically adequate , manner .",
    "a serious problem is the failure of the code for models with convective cores , when diffusion and settling of both helium and heavy elements are included ( cf .",
    "* ) ; on the other hand , the case of just helium diffusion can be handled .",
    "this problem may be related to issues of semiconvection where convective stability is closely related to the details of the composition profile @xcite .     against fractional radius in two @xmath121 models of age 1.36 gyr and with @xmath122 .",

    ", width=325 ]    in astec i have considered two cases of semiconvection , although the implementation is still under development .",
    "one case concerns growing convective cores in non - diffusing models ( see also sect .  [",
    "sec : conv ] ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgrad ] .",
    "the dashed curves illustrate the properties of a model computed with the normal astec implementation , where the hydrogen abundance @xmath75 is discontinuous at the boundary of the core ( see panels a and b ) .",
    "as discussed above , the extent of the convective core is determined by the behaviour of the radiative temperature gradient @xmath113 in the radiative region ( see panel c ) , is in fact positive at the point identified as the convective boundary . ]",
    "leading to a convectively stable region just beneath the boundary which nonetheless is assumed to be fully mixed .",
    "a possibly more reasonable treatment , illustrated by the continuous curves , assumes that a hydrogen - abundance profile is established such that @xmath124 in the outermost parts of the convective core .",
    "since this affects a very small part of the core of the model the effects on its global properties are modest ; however , it may have some influence on its pulsational properties , particularly for g modes or interface modes predominantly trapped near the boundary of the core , possibly offering the potential for asteroseismic diagnostics of this behaviour .",
    "significant sensitivity to the treatment of this region was indeed found by @xcite ; a similar model , but computed without such treatment of semiconvection ( and with somewhat inadequate mesh resolution of the critical region ) displayed far larger frequency differences than did the model considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgrad ] between oscillation codes using different numerical techniques , particularly for modes with g - mode like behaviour and partly trapped near the edge of the core .",
    "the second aspect of semiconvection concerns the base of the convective envelope in models with diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements .",
    "as noted by @xcite and discussed in more detail by @xcite the gradient in the heavy - element abundance @xmath80 established by settling beneath the convection zone leads to convective instability , e.g. , in @xmath125 models of age somewhat higher than the present sun .",
    "complete mixing of the unstable region removes the gradient and hence the cause of the instability , leading to an uncertain situation , characteristic of semiconvection . as above",
    ", a perhaps reasonable assumption might be that partial mixing takes place to establish composition gradients that ensure neutral convective stability in the critical region , with @xmath124 .",
    "since the opacity depends both on @xmath75 and @xmath80 the mixing must consistently affect both abundances .",
    "i have attempted to implement this by including a turbulent diffusivity , obviously common to all elements , determined iteratively as a function of depth beneath the convection zone such that the resulting profiles of @xmath75 and @xmath80 lead to neutral stability .",
    "no stellar evolution code is probably ever finished or fully tested .",
    "astec has certainly proved useful in a number of applications , and the results for the sun , as applied to helioseismology , are perhaps reasonably reliable , at least within the framework of ` standard solar modelling ' .",
    "it is obvious , however , that application to the increasingly accurate and detailed asteroseismic data will require further development .",
    "the tests provided through the esta collaboration and extended through the helas coordination action are certainly most valuable in this regard .",
    "i am very grateful to d. o. gough for his assistance in developing the initial version of the code , including the basic package to solve the equations of stellar evolution .",
