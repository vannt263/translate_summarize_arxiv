    "the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds is one of the central issues in condensed matter physics@xcite . in particular , urhge and ucoge",
    "have attracted much attention in recent years because they show the coexistence of long - range ferromagnetic order and superconductivity under an ambient pressure@xcite .",
    "they are weak ferromagnets , with @xmath3  k and @xmath4  @xmath5 ( urhge ) , and @xmath6  k and @xmath7  @xmath5 ( ucoge ) .",
    "they undergo transition into superconducting states below @xmath8  k ( urhge ) @xcite and @xmath9  k ( ucoge ) @xcite , and the superconducting state and magnetic orderings coexist below @xmath10 .",
    "the natures of the superconductivity and magnetism in these compounds have been well studied experimentally .",
    "for example , the magnetic field and the pressure phase diagrams of these compounds have been obtained experimentally , and it has been suggested that these compounds are located near the quantum critical point of the magnetic transition@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nqr study of ucoge clarified that the superconducting state and long - range magnetic ordering uniformly coexist in this compound @xcite .    on the other hand , the electronic structures of these compounds are not well understood .",
    "an itinerant nature of u  5@xmath1 states has been expected from the small ordering moments in the ferromagnetic phase as well as their pressure dependences @xcite .",
    "in addition , x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies of urhge @xcite , urh@xmath11ru@xmath12ge @xcite , and ucoge @xcite showed that the u  5@xmath1 state forms peak structures near the fermi level ( @xmath13 ) , suggesting that the u  5@xmath1 electrons in these compounds have an itinerant nature .",
    "however , precise information about u  5@xmath1 states has not been obtained in these studies , and a definitive conclusion has not yet been obtained . to establish realistic models of superconductivity and magnetism in these compounds , it is essential to reveal their microscopic electronic structures .    here",
    "we report the direct observation of the band structure of urhge through an angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) study .",
    "the band structure of urhge is obtained for the first time , and it is found that the u  5@xmath1 electrons form fermi surfaces ( fs s ) in this compound .",
    "photoemission experiments were performed at the soft x - ray beamline bl23su of spring-8 @xcite .",
    "the overall energy resolution in angle - integrated photoemission ( aipes ) experiments at @xmath14=800  ev was about 110  mev , and that in arpes experiments at @xmath15  ev was 100160  mev , depending on the photon energies .",
    "the position of @xmath13 was carefully determined by measurements of the evaporated gold film .",
    "clean sample surfaces were obtained by cleaving the sample _ in situ _ with the surface parallel to the @xmath16 plane .",

    "first , we present the aipes spectra of urhge .",
    "figure  [ aipes ] ( a ) shows the valence - band spectrum of urhge taken at @xmath14=800  ev .",
    "the sample temperature was kept at 20  k , and the compound is in a paramagnetic phase .",
    "the spectrum is identical to that in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this photon energy range ,",
    "the contributions from u  5@xmath1 and rh  4@xmath18 states are dominant , and those from @xmath21 and @xmath22 states are two or three orders of magnitude smaller than those of u  5@xmath1 and rh  4@xmath18 states @xcite . in the valence - band spectrum , there is a sharp peak structure just below @xmath13 . on the high - binding - energy side",
    ", there is a broad peak structure distributed at @xmath23  ev . to understand the origin of this peak structure ,",
    "we have compared this spectrum with the result of the band - structure calculation . in the calculation ,",
    "relativistic - linear - augmented - plane - wave ( rlapw ) band - structure calculations@xcite within the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite were performed for urhge treating all u  5@xmath1 electrons as being itinerant . in the lower part of the fig .",
    "@xcite ( a ) , the calculated u  5@xmath1 and rh  4@xmath18 density of states broadened by the instrumental resolution are indicated .",
    "comparison between the spectrum and the calculated density of states suggests that the sharp peak structure near @xmath13 and the broad peak structure on the high - binding - energy sides correspond to u  5@xmath1 and rh  4@xmath18 states , respectively . here",
    ", it should be noted that a shoulder - like structure is recognized at around @xmath24  ev in the experimental spectrum .",
    "a similar structure is present in the calculated u  5@xmath1 dos as well , and this suggests that this shoulder structure originates not from the electron correlation effect , but from the band structure .",
    "the overall spectral shape is consistent with the results of the band - structure calculation .",
    "figure  [ aipes ] ( b ) shows the u  4@xmath1 core - level spectrum of urhge together with those of the typical itinerant 5@xmath1 compound ub@xmath19 and localized 5@xmath1 compound upd@xmath20 .",
    "these data are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "they show a spin - orbit splitting corresponding to u  4@xmath25 and u  4@xmath26 , and both of them have asymmetric line shapes .",
    "the core - level spectrum of urhge has a relatively simple spectral line shape .",
    "it is similar to that of the itinerant 5@xmath1 compound ub@xmath19 , suggesting that u  5@xmath1 electrons in urhge have an itinerant character .",
    "meanwhile , the spectrum of urhge is much broader than that of ub@xmath19 , and is accompanied by a satellite structure on the high - binding - energy side , as has been observed in the upd@xmath20 spectrum .",
    "this implies that the u  5@xmath1 electrons in urhge have a correlated character as well .",
    "we first explain about the brillouin zone and the calculated fss of urhge .",
    "figure  [ 3dfs ] shows the simple orthorhombic brillouin zone of urhge and the calculated fss in the paramagnetic phase . in the band - structure calculation ,",
    "bands 6972 form fss as shown in the figure .",
    "fs  69 is a small hole pocket around the y point .",
    "fs  70 has a highly three - dimensional shape .",
    "it forms a connected hole fs along the @xmath27 direction and a hole pocket fs in the middle of the @xmath28 and x points .",
    "fs  71 is an electron fs with a grid - like shape spreading along the @xmath29@xmath30 plane .",
    "fs  72 has a pillar - like shape along the @xmath30 direction at the corner of the brillouin zone .",
    "all these calculated fss have large contributions from u  5@xmath1 states .",

    ", there exist dispersive bands with strong intensities .",
    "these are contributions from the u  5@xmath1 quasiparticle bands .",
    "the peak intensities of these structures have strong momentum dependences , suggesting that the u  5@xmath1 quasiparticle bands have finite energy dispersions . on the high - binding - energy side ( @xmath32  ev ) , there exist dispersive bands with strong intensities .",
    "these are the contributions from the rh  4@xmath18 bands .        here",
    ", it should be noted that those bands are not symmetric relative to the high - symmetry points .",
    "for example , the spectra measured along the x-@xmath28-x high - symmetry line are not symmetric relative to the x point in fig .",
    "[ arpes1 ] ( a ) .",
    "this may be due to the photoemission structure factor effect as has been observed in arpes spectra of other materials @xcite . to eliminate this effect , we have symmetrized these arpes spectra relative to the high - symmetry points .",
    "figures  [ arpes2 ] ( a)-[arpes2](c ) show the symmetrized arpes intensity maps .",
    "the behaviors of the bands are clearly demonstrated in these images .",
    "to evaluate the validity of the itinerant description of the u  5@xmath1 states in this compound , we compare the present arpes spectra with the result of the band - structure calculation treating all u  5@xmath1 electrons as being itinerant .",

    "many dispersive bands exist in the calculation , and it is difficult to compare them with the experimentally observed bands one by one . meanwhile , the overall band structures have some similarities between the experiment and the calculation . on the high - binding - energy side ( @xmath35  ev ) , the contributions from rh  4@xmath18 states were observed in both the experiment and the calculation . in the vicinity of @xmath13",

    "there exist few bands in the energy region in between them ( @xmath36  ev ) , and some calculated bands seem to correspond to the experimental spectra .",

    "[ arpes3 ] ( c ) ] . in the simulation ,",

    "the details are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the arpes spectra and the calculations is more clearly recognized .",
    "a detailed comparison suggests that there are some similarities between the experiment and the calculation .",
    "some agreements are clearly identified , especially in the spectra along the u - z - u and s - y - s high - symmetry lines .",
    "for example , along the u - z - u high - symmetry line , the experimentally observed three bands b , c , and d , correspond to the calculated bands 6566 , 6768 , and 6970 , respectively . in addition",
    ", there are similar qualitative agreements in the spectra along the s - y - s high - symmetry line .",
    "bands a , b , c , d , and e in the experimental spectra correspond to the bands 6364 , 6566 , 6768 , 69 - 70 , and 7172 , respectively .",
    "in particular , band e forms a small electron pocket around the s point , which can be clearly recognized in the spectra normalized by the areas of the momentum distribution curves shown in the inset in the fig .",
    "[ arpes3 ] ( c ) .",
    "a similar electron pocket exists in the band - structure calculation as bands 71 and 72 . on the other hand",
    ", band d does not have a large energy dispersion , and it does not form a fs as bands 69 and 70 do in the calculation . therefore , the agreement is unsatisfactory , especially in bands near @xmath13 .",
    "the agreement is further unclear in the spectra along the x-@xmath28-x high - symmetry line .",
    "the calculated spectra have a complicated structure , and it seems very different from the experimental spectra .",
    "however , there are still some corresponding features in both the experiment and the calculation . for example , the inverted parabolic band with its apex at @xmath39  0.2  ev at the x point in the experimental spectra has a correspondence to bands 6364 in the calculation . the inverted parabolic band with its apex at @xmath39  1.0  ev at the @xmath28 point corresponds to part of the calculated bands 6165 .",
    "the states near @xmath13 in the experimental spectra are rather featureless , and they are very different from the calculation . therefore , the agreement between the experiment and the calculation is limited , especially in states near @xmath13 , and we could not obtain information on the shape of fs s from the present experimental data .",
    "in addition , many flat bands are expected around @xmath13 in the calculation , and even a tiny change in @xmath13 , by the order of 10  mev , drastically changes the shape of calculated fs s .",
    "this makes it more difficult to compare states near @xmath13 between the experiment and the calculation .",
    "next , we show the changes in the electronic structure due to the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "figures  [ tempdep ] ( a ) and [ tempdep ] ( b ) show blowups of arpes spectra measured along the x-@xmath28-x line at 20  k ( paramagnetic phase ) and 6  k ( ferromagnetic phase ) , respectively . although the changes are not significant , some temperature dependencies were clearly observed .",
    "here , it should be noted that the energy difference between these two sample temperatures ( 20  k , @xmath401.7  mev ; 6  k , @xmath400.5  mev ) is much smaller than the energy scale of the changes in the arpes spectra , suggesting that the changes are not due to a thermal broadening effect . to see details of the changes",
    ", we have subtracted the spectra measured at 20  k from those measured at 6  k. the intensity map of the difference in the spectra measured at 20  k vs 6  k is shown in fig .  [ tempdep ] ( c ) , and the spectra at the @xmath28 point are depicted in fig .",
    "[ tempdep ] ( d ) .",
    "intensities are normalized with the highest intensity in the momentum and energy area shown in this figure .",
    "both spectra are normalized to the intensities of the rh 4@xmath18 bands located at @xmath41  ev .",
    "there are two kinds of changes in the spectral functions .",
    "first , the intensities in the region of @xmath42  ev , which correspond to contributions mainly from u  5@xmath1 quasiparticle bands , decrease in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the area is designated a in the figure .",
    "the changes in spectral intensities near @xmath13 suggest that the ferromagnetic ordering in this compound originates from the itinerant u  5@xmath1 quasiparticle bands .",
    "in addition to these changes , the intensities at around @xmath43  ev at the @xmath28 point decrease . the area is designated b in the figure .",
    "the origin of this change is discussed in the next section .",
    "accordingly , we have observed dispersive u  5@xmath1 quasiparticle bands near @xmath13 in arpes spectra of urhge .",
    "they form fss in this compound , suggesting that they have basically an itinerant nature . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreement between the experimentally obtained spectra and the band - structure calculation is limited .",
    "the agreement is not satisfactory as those of the itinerant paramagnets ufega@xmath44 @xcite and ub@xmath19 @xcite , or the itinerant antiferromagnet un @xcite .",
    "in particular , the states near @xmath13 ( @xmath2  ev ) show considerable deviations from the calculation .",
    "the ellipsoidal pocket fs with a size of about 7 % of the brillouin zone was observed in sdh oscillations @xcite , but it does not exist in the calculated fs s .",
    "this also suggests that the shape of fs s might be different from the calculation . these claim that the lda might be a reasonable starting point to describe its electronic structure , but inclusion of the electron correlation is needed to describe its electronic structure .",
    "furthermore , the core - level spectrum of urhge has a satellite peak on the high - binding - energy side of the main line as shown in fig .",
    "[ aipes ] ( b ) , suggesting the importance of the dynamical screening effect in urhge .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of dynamical correlation effects alters the band structure near @xmath13 @xcite , and such a theoretical framework is a step forward to the understanding of this compound .",
    "changes in the spectral line shape due to the ferromagnetic transition were observed in the vicinity of @xmath13 as well as on the high - binding - energy side ( @xmath45  ev ) .",
    "the former change suggests that the ferromagnetic ordering in this compound is due to the changes in itinerant quasiparticle bands near @xmath13 .",
    "although their details were not resolved in the present spectra , the changes are presumably due to the splitting of bands into majority - spin and minority - spin bands in the ferromagnetic phase as has been observed in ute @xcite and uir @xcite since u  5@xmath1 electrons have an itinerant nature in urhge as well . in the stoner - type mean - field model of itinerant ferromagnetism",
    ", the exchange splitting energy @xmath46 is expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the stoner parameter and the magnetization respectively .",
    "the stoner parameter @xmath48 might be somewhat different in the cases of ute and urhge , but the smaller magnetic moment of urhge ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) compared to ute ( @xmath50  @xmath5 ) implies that the energy shift of the majority and minority bands ( @xmath51 ) of urhge should be much smaller than that of ute ( @xmath52 50  mev@xcite ) . furthermore , it is experimentally known that @xmath46 approximately scales with @xmath53 in itinerant ferromagnets@xcite , and the one order - lower transition temperature of urhge ( @xmath3  k ) compared to ute ( @xmath54  k ) also argues that its @xmath46 should be much smaller than that of uir .",
    "these imply that the @xmath55 of urhge should be of the order of 10  mev , and its direct observation is difficult at the present energy resolution ( @xmath56  mev ) .    meanwhile ,",
    "the latter change on the high - binding - energy side is not the mean - field - like splitting of energy bands , but the change in peak structure .",
    "this change might originate from the incoherent part of the spectrum due to the correlation effect of u  5@xmath1 states .",
    "riseborough @xcite suggested that the incoherent spin excitation produces an incoherent peak in the off-@xmath13 region in a weak ferromagnet near a quantum critical point .",
    "a similar change was observed in the spectra of the ferromagnet uir , where the peak at the @xmath57 point and @xmath580.5  ev was changed , in addition to the state near @xmath13 @xcite , by the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "therefore , this change on the high - binding - energy side might be a common feature of uranium ferromagnets located near a quantum critical point .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that quasiparticle bands with large contributions from u  5@xmath1 states form fss of urhge .",
    "the overall band structure of urhge is explained by the band - structure calculation based on the lda , but the shape of the band structure near @xmath13 shows considerable deviations from the calculation .",
    "the experimental band structure near @xmath13 is rather featureless , and the shapes of fs s are qualitatively different from the calculation . in addition , the u  4@xmath1 core - level spectrum of urhge is accompanied by a satellite peak , which is a signature of the electron correlation effect .",
    "these results suggest that the inclusion of an electron correlation effect is essential to describe its electronic structure although the band - structure calculation is an appropriate starting point .",
    "the changes in arpes spectra associated with the ferromagnetic transition were observed in the band near @xmath13 as well as states on the high - binding - energy side .",
    "the former should be due to the exchange splitting of quasiparticle bands , while the latter might be related to the correlated nature of u  5@xmath1 states .",
