    ". see figure  [ fig::monok3edge ] for an illustration .",
    "indeed , there is at most one red edge between each vertex in @xmath773 and @xmath197 and for at most one vertex in @xmath197 both edges to @xmath518 are blue . hence for exactly one vertex in @xmath197 both edges to @xmath518 are blue and there are exactly two further independent blue edges between @xmath197 and @xmath518 .",
    "this proves claim  [ claim-1 ] .    by assumption the four vertices in @xmath736",
    "do not induce a monochromatic @xmath781 and hence there are at least two blue edges @xmath673 , @xmath589 . let @xmath546 , @xmath547 denote the red copies of @xmath455 in @xmath594",
    ". we will apply claim  [ claim-1 ] to each of the pairs @xmath794 , @xmath795 , @xmath796 , @xmath797 .",
    "there is a vertex @xmath798 in @xmath634 , @xmath309 , such that both edges between @xmath798 and a blue edge in @xmath736 are blue by claim  [ claim-1 ] .",
    "then @xmath799 , since otherwise there is blue copy of @xmath781 .",
    "hence the blue edges in @xmath736 are independent , since two adjacent blue edges together with @xmath790 form a blue @xmath781 .",
    "thus @xmath673 and @xmath589 are the only blue edges in @xmath736 .",
    "see figure  [ fig::k9h32 ] for the partial labeling .",

    "this proves claim  [ claim-2 ] .",
    "let @xmath805 denote the vertex which is adjacent to @xmath786 and @xmath788 in red which exists by claim  [ claim-2 ] . without loss of generality",

    "either there is a monochromatic copy of @xmath781 in the copy of @xmath591 in @xmath816 or we may assume by lemma  [ lem::k9h32 ] that the @xmath591 in @xmath816 is an edge disjoint union of a red @xmath818 and a blue @xmath818 .",
    "each edge in @xmath591 belongs to a unique monochromatic triangle . if @xmath166 sends two blue edges to vertices @xmath819 , where @xmath708 is blue , then the blue triangle containing @xmath708 in @xmath591 together with @xmath166 form a blue @xmath781 .",
    "thus , we may assume that neighborhood of @xmath166 via blue edges forms a red clique , and , similarly , its neighborhood via red edges forms a red clique .",

    "if there is a red edge between a vertex of degree @xmath206 of @xmath594 and @xmath736 , we have a monochromatic @xmath820 .",

    "now , assume that any monochromatic @xmath781 contains @xmath166 , i.e. , there is no monochromatic @xmath781 in a copy of @xmath591 of @xmath816 .",
    "hence the coloring of @xmath591 is like it is described in lemma  [ lem::k9h32 ] .",
