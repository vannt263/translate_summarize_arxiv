    "@xcite for recent reviews , for , at least , two reasons : they preserve a part of the chiral symmetry of continuum qcd which allows one to study the chiral aspects of the finite temperature transition , and are relatively inexpensive to simulate numerically because due to the absence of an additive mass renormalization the dirac operator is bounded from below",
    ". however , lattice artifacts related to taste symmetry breaking turned out to be numerically large . to reduce the taste violations smeared links , i.e.",
    "weighted averages of different paths on the lattice that connect neighboring points , are used in the staggered dirac operator and several improved staggered formulations , like p4 , asqtad , stout and hisq differ in the choice of the smeared gauge links . the ones in the p4 and asqtad actions are linear combinations of single links and different staples @xcite and therefore are not elements of the su(3 ) group .",
    "it is known that projecting the smeared gauge fields onto the su(3 ) group greatly improves the taste symmetry @xcite .",
    "the stout action @xcite and the hisq action implement the projection of the smeared gauge field onto the su(3 ) ( or simply u(3 ) ) group and thus achieve better taste symmetry at a given lattice spacing . for studying qcd at high temperature",
    "it is important to use discretization schemes which improve the quark dispersion relation , thus eliminating the tree level @xmath4 lattice artifacts in thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the p4 and asqtad actions implement this improvement by introducing 3-link terms in the staggered dirac operator .",
    "in this paper we report preliminary results on the chiral and deconfinement transition in qcd at non - zero temperature obtained with the hisq action which combines the removal of tree level @xmath4 lattice artifacts with the addition of projected smeared links that greatly improve the taste symmetry .",
    "we also compare our results to the continuum extrapolated results obtained with the stout action @xcite .",
    "the highly improved staggered quark ( hisq ) action developed by the hpqcd / ukqcd collaboration @xcite reduces taste symmetry breaking and decreases the splitting between different pion tastes by a factor of about three compared to the asqtad action .",
    "the net result , as recent scaling studies show @xcite , is that a hisq ensemble at lattice spacing @xmath5 has scaling violations comparable to ones in an asqtad ensemble at lattice spacing @xmath6 .    in this study",
    "we used the hisq action in the fermion sector and the tree - level symanzik improved gauge action .",
    "the strange quark mass @xmath7 was set to its physical value adjusting the quantity @xmath8 to the physical value 686.57  mev .",
    "we used two values of the light quark mass : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these correspond to the lightest pion mass of about @xmath11  mev and @xmath12  mev respectively @xcite .",
    "calculations have been performed on @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattices for the smaller quark mass , while for the larger quark mass we used @xmath15 lattices . at several values of the lattice spacings zero temperature simulations",
    "have been performed on @xmath16 lattices for @xmath9 and on @xmath17 lattices for @xmath18 .",
    "the molecular dynamics ( md ) trajectories have length of 1 time unit ( tu ) and the measurements were performed every 5 tus at zero and 10 tus at finite temperature . however , for the few smallest beta values the trajectories had length of @xmath19 or @xmath20 tu . in this case measurements",
    "have been performed after each 20 or 30 trajectories ( which corresponds , again , to 10 tus ) .",
    "typically , at least 300 tus were discarded for equilibration at the beginning of the simulations .",
    "the lattice spacing has been determined by measuring the static quark anti - quark potential . as in previous studies by the milc collaboration the static potential was calculated fixing to coulomb gauge and considering temporal wilson lines of different extent . forming the ratio of these correlators and fitting them to a constant plus linear ansatz we extracted the static potential @xmath21 .",
    "we have calculated the sommer scale @xmath22 defined as @xmath23 the potential has been normalized to the string potential    @xmath24    at @xmath25 or equivalently to the value @xmath26 at @xmath27 . the additive constant determined by this normalization",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the limit of zero light quark masses qcd has a chiral symmetry and the finite temperature transition is a true phase transition .",
    "the order parameter for this transition is the light chiral condensate @xmath29 .",
    "however , even at finite values of the quark mass the chiral condensate will show a rapid change in the transition region indicating an effective restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the fluctuations of the chiral condensate , also called the disconnected chiral susceptibility , will have a peak at the transition temperature .",
    "recent studies with the p4 action suggest that for the physical strange quark mass and two light quarks the chiral transition is of the second order for vanishing light quark mass , belonging to the @xmath30 universality class @xcite .",
    "thus , the universal properties of the chiral transition in the limit of zero light quark masses govern the transition for sufficiently small but non - zero light quark masses @xcite .",
    "the corrections to scaling turned out to be small for @xmath31 and thus the temperature variation of the chiral condensate is to a large extent determined by the singular part of the free energy density which is universal @xcite .",
    "this allows to determine the chiral transition temperature for non - zero quark masses .",
    "the temperature derivative of the chiral condensate and disconnected chiral susceptibility will diverge in the limit @xmath32 . since the chiral condensate has an additive ultraviolet renormalization we consider the subtracted chiral condensate @xcite @xmath33 here the subscript @xmath34 and @xmath35 refer to light and strange chiral condensates , while subscript @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the expectation value at zero and non - vanishing temperature .",
    "another possibility to get rid of the additive renormalization in the chiral condensate is to consider the quantity @xmath38 which up to a constant multiplicative factor is identical to the quantity introduced in ref .",

    "this allows us to give an estimate of these quantities in the continuum limit shown as the solid black lines .",
    "the continuum estimates for hisq are different from the continuum extrapolated stout results .",

    "the transition temperature is decreasing with decreasing the quark mass .",
    "also the chiral condensate at fixed temperature decreases with decreasing the quark mass .",
    "thus at a qualitative level this discrepancy could be understood .",

    "our analysis gives @xmath44 where the first error reflects the uncertainty in the determination of the peak position estimated using different fit forms and varying the fit range .",
    "the second error is due to the scale determination .",
    "the peak positions in the disconnected chiral susceptibilities are significantly lower than those obtained with p4 and asqtad actions for @xmath45 @xcite , though they are compatible with the recent estimates for asqtad on @xmath43 lattices @xcite .",
    "unfortunately no published stout data are available for the disconnected chiral susceptibility and direct comparison between hisq and stout results is not possible here .",
    "therefore , in ref .",
    "@xcite we compared hisq and stout data for the renormalized chiral susceptibility introduced in @xcite .",
    "some small discrepancies between the stout and hisq results have been found there which again are probably due to slightly different quark masses .",
    "note that within errors of the calculations the peak positions in the renormalized chiral susceptibility are consistent between hisq and stout @xcite .      by the deconfinement transition we mean liberation of many degrees of freedom , which also could be understood as a transition from hadronic degrees of freedom to partonic ones , and the onset of color screening .",
    "the aspects of the deconfinement transition related to color screening are studied in terms of the polyakov loop and polyakov loop correlators .",
    "the polyakov loop needs to be renormalized and after proper renormalization it is related to the free energy of a static quark anti - quark pair at infinite separation  @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47 the renormalized polyakov loop can be obtained from the bare polyakov loop as @xmath48 here the multiplicative renormalization constant @xmath49 is related to the additive normalization of the potential @xmath50 as @xmath51 discussed in the previous section .",

    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , in the low - temperature region the increase of @xmath52",
    "is related to the fact that there are many static - light meson states that can contribute to the static quark free energy close to the transition temperature , while far away from the transition temperature it is determined by the binding energy of the lowest static - light mesons .",
    "the strange quark number susceptibility is defined as the second derivative of the pressure with respect to the quark chemical potential @xmath53    it describes strangeness fluctuations at zero strange quark chemical potential . at low temperatures strangeness",
    "is carried by strange hadrons , which are heavy compared to the temperature . as a result strangeness fluctuations are suppressed in the low - temperature region . at high temperatures , on the other hand ,",
    "strangeness is carried by light quarks and strangeness fluctuations are close to the value given by an ideal quark gas .",
    "deconfinement will manifest itself as a rapid increase in the strangeness fluctuations in some temperature interval , reflecting the change in the relevant degrees of freedom from hadronic to partonic .",
