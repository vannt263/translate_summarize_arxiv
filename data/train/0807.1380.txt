    "since the discovery of superconductivity at 26 k in lafeaso@xmath7f@xmath8 @xcite , great interests have been stimulated in the community of superconductivity .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature was quickly raised to about @xmath9 k in smfeaso@xmath10f@xmath11@xcite , and in other fluorine doped or oxygen deficiency samples .",
    "moreover , hole - doped superconductors were also successfully synthesized in la@xmath7sr@xmath8feaso@xcite and ba@xmath7k@xmath8(feas)@xmath12 systems@xcite .",
    "many experiments have revealed that the iron - based superconductors belong to a family with unconventional pairing mechanism .",
    "these include the point contact tunneling spectropy@xcite , nmr@xcite , specific heat@xcite , lower critical field@xcite _ etc._. meanwhile , so far many theoretical models have been proposed in order to have a basic understanding to the mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "as one of the basic parameters , the anisotropy @xmath2 is crucial for both understanding the superconducting mechanism and its application , because it reflects directly the coupling strength between the `` charge reservoir '' lno ( ln = la , ce , pr , nd , gd _",
    "etc_. ) layers and the conducting feas layers .",
    "an estimation of @xmath13 30 was made on ( nd , sm)o@xmath0f@xmath1feas polycrystals from the @xmath14axis infrared plasma frequency@xcite . since the successful growth of ( nd , sm)feaso@xmath0f@xmath1 single crystals@xcite , precise determination of @xmath2 was possible .",
    "the recent study on smfeaso@xmath15f@xmath16 single crystals revealed that the magnetic anisotropy was temperature dependent , ranging from @xmath17 8 at @xmath18 to @xmath17 23 at @xmath19@xcite .",
    "moreover , in our previous work on the ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 single crystals@xcite , @xmath2 was calculated from the upper critical fields parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath20-plane , and was found below 5 near @xmath21 . as a further study on the superconductivity of ndfeaso@xmath7f@xmath8 single crystals , here",
    "we report the angular dependence of resistivity in the superconducting state of ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 single crystals . by doing the scaling of the resistivity based on the anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory , the angle dependent resistivity measured under different magnetic fields at a certain temperature collapse onto one curve . thus the anisotropy was determined for different temperatures .",
    "the single crystals of ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 were grown by flux method at ambient pressure , which have been described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the typical lateral sizes of the crystals are about 20 @xmath22 to 70 @xmath23 , while thickness is about @xmath24 micrometers .",
    "electrical contacts were made using the pt deposition technology of a focused - ion - beam ( fib ) system .",
    "the upper inset of fig .",
    "1 presents the image of the single crystal with pt leads .",
    "k and @xmath25k .",
    "the upper inset shows the scanning electron microscope image of the ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 single crystal with pt leads .",
    "the lower inset illustrates schematically the definition of angle @xmath26 . ]",
    "the angle - resolved resistivity measurements were carried out on a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) with magnetic fields up to 9 t. the angle @xmath26 was varied from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 corresponded to the configuration of @xmath30 axis and @xmath31 to @xmath32 plane , respectively ( as shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "1 ) . the veracity of the angle was ensured by the good @xmath33-axis orientation of the crystals , which have been demonstrated by the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis@xcite . in our measurement ,",
    "the current density was 150 @xmath34 and the current was always perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the sample exhibited a sharp resistive superconducting transition at @xmath35 k with @xmath36 k , the residual resistivity @xmath37 and @xmath386.5 ( shown in fig .",
    "1 ) , demonstrating the good quality of the single crystal .",
    "the insets in fig . 2 and fig . 3 present four sets of data for angular dependence of resistivity at temperatures of 44 k , 46 k , 48 k and 50 k. taking the @xmath39 data at @xmath6 k ( the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) ) as an example , all the curves show a dip - like structure with the minimum at @xmath31 and maximum at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the angular dependence of resistivity is not very steep , this suggests the moderate anisotropy of the ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 single crystal .",
    "according to the anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory , the angular dependence of the upper critical fields is given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the upper critical fields with @xmath32plane and @xmath30axis , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the effective masses when the electrons move along @xmath14axis and @xmath48plane respectively , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the coherence lengths along @xmath14axis and @xmath48plane , respectively . on this basis ,",
    "developed a general scaling approach for the angular dependence of resistivity@xcite .",
    "based on this method , the resistivity measured under different magnetic fields at a certain temperature should collapse on one curve if @xmath51coordinate is properly scaled . the rescaled function for @xmath51coordinate is : @xmath52     ( see text ) for ( a ) @xmath6 k and ( b ) @xmath53 k. insets : the angular dependence of magnetoresistivity at ( a ) @xmath54 0.5 , 2 , 5 , 9 t and ( b ) @xmath54 0.5 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 t. the anisotropy parameters are found to be 6.24 @xmath55 0.09 for @xmath6 k and 5.92 @xmath55 0.09 for @xmath53 k ]     ( see text ) for ( a ) @xmath56 k and ( b ) @xmath5 k. the insets present the angular dependence of magnetoresistivity at ( a ) @xmath54 0.5 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 t and ( b ) @xmath54 0.5 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 9 t. the scaling parameters are @xmath57 0.08 for @xmath56 k and @xmath58 0.08 for @xmath5 k ]    by adjusting @xmath2 , excellent scaling curves are obtained for each set of data at different temperatures , shown in the main panels of fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 . in this treatment",
    ", only one variable @xmath2 is employed as the fitting parameter , so the value of @xmath2 is more reliable comparing with that determined from the ratio of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which might be affected by the criterion of @xmath59 determination .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath2 takes 6.24@xmath550.08 for @xmath60 k , 5.92@xmath550.08 for @xmath61 k , 5.66@xmath550.09 for @xmath62 k and 5.48@xmath550.09 for @xmath63 k. such values are consistent with that we estimated from @xmath64@xcite , but smaller than the values obtained on smfeaso@xmath15f@xmath16 single crystals using a torque technique@xcite .",
    "it is found that , as plotted in fig .",
    "4 , the anisotropy increases slowly with decreasing temperature .",
    "the similar behavior of @xmath3 was also observed in smfeaso@xmath15f@xmath16 single crystals@xcite , which was attributed to the two - gap scenario@xcite .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the good scaling behavior suggests a field - independent anisotropy in our measuring range .    .",
    "the line is guided to eyes . ]    for comparison , in mgb@xmath12 , a typical two - band superconductor , clear deviations have been observed between the experimental @xmath65 and the anisotropy g - l description .",
    "such a phenomenon was attributed to the different anisotropy factors of the two bands@xcite . whereas , no such deviation is found in our experiment ,",
    "so we suggest that single band or multi - band with similar anisotropy parameters should exist in the ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 superconductors .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the angle dependent resistivity in the superconducting state of ndfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 single crystals .",
    "it is found that the @xmath66 data measured at a certain temperature can be described by a scaling law based on the anisotropic ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "thus the values of anisotropy are extracted for different temperatures .",
    "it is found that @xmath3 increases with decreasing temperature , which was attributed to the multi - band effect .",
