    "understanding the complexity of genomes and the drives that shape them is a fundamental problem of contemporary biology  @xcite , which poses a number of challenges to contemporary statistical mechanics . considering this problem from a large - scale viewpoint , the basic observables to account for are the distributions of the different `` functional components '' ( such as genes , introns , non - coding rna , etc . ) encoded by sequenced genomes of varying size .",
    "when these genome - wide data are parametrized by measures of `` genome size '' ( such as the number of bases or the number of genes in a genome ) , there are important emerging `` scaling laws '' both for the classes of evolutionary related genes  @xcite , the functional categories of genes  @xcite and some non - coding parts of genomes  @xcite .",
    "these scaling laws are the signs of universal invariants in the processes and constraints that gave rise to the genomes as they can be observed today .",
    "a current challenge is the understanding of these laws using physical modeling concepts and the comparison of the models to the available whole - genome data .",
    "this effort can help disentangle neutral from selective effects  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the statistical features of the set of proteins expressed by a genome , or proteome . a convenient level of analysis is a description of the proteome in terms of structural protein domains  @xcite .",
    "domains are modular `` topologies '' , or sub - shapes , forming proteins  @xcite .",
    "a domain determines a set of potential biochemical or biophysical functions and interactions for a protein , such as binding to other proteins or dna and participation in well - defined classes of biochemical reactions  @xcite . despite the practically unlimited number of possible protein sequences , the repertoire of basic topologies for domains seems to be relatively small  @xcite . with a loose",
    "parallel , domains could be seen as an `` alphabet '' of basic elements of the protein universe .",
    "understanding the usage of domains across organisms is as important and challenging as decoding an unknown language .",
    "the content of a genome is determined primarily by its evolutionary history , in which neutral processes and natural selection play interdependent roles .",
    "in particular , the coding parts of genomes evolve by some well - defined basic `` moves '' : gene loss , gene duplication , horizontal gene transfer ( the transfer of genetic material between unrelated species ) , and gene genesis ( the _ de novo _ origin of genes ) .",
    "since domains are modular evolutionary building blocks for proteins , they are coupled to the dynamics followed by genes . in particular ,",
    "a new domain topology can emerge by genesis or horizontal transfer , and new domains of existing domain topologies can emerge by duplication or be lost .",
    "finally , topologies can be completely lost by a genome if the last domain that carries them is lost ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "large - scale data concerning structural domains are available from bioinformatic databases , and can be analyzed at the genome level .",
    "these coarse - grained data structures can be represented as sets of `` domain classes '' ( the sets of all realizations of the same domain topology in proteins ) , populated by domain realizations . in particular ,",
    "much attention has been drawn by the intriguing discovery that the population of domain classes have power - law distributions  @xcite : the number @xmath0 of domain classes having @xmath1 members follows the power - law @xmath2 , where the exponent @xmath3 typically lies between 1 and 2 .",
    "an interesting thread of modeling work ascribes the emergence of power - laws to a generic preferential - attachment principle due to gene duplication .",
    "growth models are formulated as nonstationary , duplication - innovation models  @xcite and as stationary birth - death - innovation models  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , as we have recently shown  @xcite , the domain content of genomes also exhibits scaling laws as a function of the total number of domains @xmath4 , indicating that even evolutionarily distant genomes show common trends where the relevant parameter is their size .    *",
    "the number of domain classes ( or distinct hits of the same domain ) concentrates around a master curve @xmath5 that appears to be markedly sublinear with size , perhaps saturating .",
    "* the fitted exponent of the power - law - like distribution @xmath0 of domain classes having @xmath1 members , in a proteome of size @xmath4 decreases with genome size .",
    "in other words , there is evidence for a cutoff that increases linearly with @xmath4 . *",
    "the occurrence of fold topologies across genomes is highly inhomogeneous - some domain superfamilies are found in all genomes , some rare , with a sigmoid - like drop between these two categories  ,  [ fig : alphafit ] ,  [ fig : cutoff ] , and  [ fig : occurrence ] of this work . ] .",
    "we recently reported the above collective trends , and showed how the scaling laws in the data could be reproduced using universal parameters with non - stationary duplication - innovation models .",
    "our results indicate that the basic evolutionary moves themselves can determine the observed scaling behavior of domain content , _ a priori _ of more specific biological trends .",
    "this modeling approach , while similar in formulation to that of previous investigators  @xcite who did not consider these scaling laws , has important modifications , mostly related to the scaling with @xmath4 of the relative probability of adding a domain belonging to a new class and duplicating an existing one . to reproduce the observed trends ,",
    "newly added domain classes can not be treated as _",
    "independent _ random variables , but are conditioned by the preexisting proteome structure .    in this paper , we give a detailed account of this modeling approach , considering different variants of duplication - innovation - loss models for protein domains , and relate them to available results in the mathematical and physical literature . in particular , we will focus on mean - field approaches for the models and comparison with direct simulation , and we will show how they can be generally used to obtain the main qualitative and quantitative trends .    the first part of the paper is devoted to the minimal model formulation , which only includes duplication and innovation moves for domains , and relates to the so - called _ chinese restaurant process ( crp ) _ of the mathematical literature  @xcite .",
    "we will review the main known results for this model , derive analytically solvable mean - field equations , and show how they compare to the available rigorous results and the finite size behavior .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to biologically motivated variants of the main model related to two main features : including the role of loss of domains , which is a frequently reported event , and breaking the exchange symmetry of domain classes , which is unrealistic , as specific protein domains perform different biological functions . for these variants ,",
    "we will present mean - field and simulations results , and characterize their phenomenology in relation with empirical data .",
    "in particular , while in general for these variants the rigorous mathematical results existing for the crp break down , we will show how the use of simple mean - field methods proves to be a robust tool for accessing the qualitative phenomenology .",
    "the model represents a proteome through its repertoire of domains .",
    "domains having the same topology are collected in domain classes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "thus the relevant data structures are partitions of elements ( domains ) into classes .",
    "the basic observables considered are the following : @xmath4 , the total number of domains , @xmath6 , a random variable indicating the number of classes ( distinct domain topologies ) at size @xmath4 , a random variable @xmath7 , the population of class @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the size at birth of class @xmath8 , and @xmath10 : the number of domain classes having @xmath1 members .",
    "we will generally indicate mean values by capitalized letters ( e.g.  @xmath5 is the mean value of @xmath6 , @xmath11 the mean value of @xmath7 , etc . ) .",
    "the model is conceived as a stochastic process based on the elementary moves available to a genome ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) of adding and losing domains , associated to relative probabilities : @xmath12 , the probability to duplicate an old domain ( modeling gene duplication ) , @xmath13 , the probability to add a new domain class with one member ( which describes domain innovation , for example by horizontal transfer ) , and @xmath14 , a loss probability ( which we will initially disregard , and consider in a second step ) .",
    "iteratively , either a domain is added or it is lost with the prescribed probabilities .        an important feature of the duplication move is the ( null ) hypothesis that duplication of a domain has uniform probability along the genome , and thus it is more probable to pick a domain of a larger class .",
    "this is a common feature with previous models  @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis creates a `` preferential attachment ''  @xcite principle , stating the fact that duplication is more likely in a larger domain class , which , in this model as in previous ones , is responsible for the emergence of power - law distributions .    in mathematical terms , if the duplication probability is split as the sum of per - class probabilities @xmath15 , this hypothesis requires that @xmath16 , where @xmath7 is the population of class @xmath8 , i.e.  the probability of finding a domain of a particular class and duplicating it is proportional to the number of members of that class .",
    "it is important to notice that in this model , while @xmath4 can be used as an arbitrary measure of time , the ratio of the time - scales of duplication and innovation is not arbitrary , and is set by the ratio @xmath17 . in the model of gerstein and coworkers , this is taken as a constant , as the innovation move considered to be statistically independent from the genome content . in particular , both probabilities are considered to be constant .",
    "this choice has two problems .",
    "first , it can not give the observed sublinear scaling of @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , if the probability of adding a new domain is constant with @xmath4 , so will be the rate of addition , implying that this quantity will increase on average linearly with genome size .",
    "moreover , the same model gives power - law distributions for the classes with exponent larger than two , in contrast with most of the available data .",
    "previous investigators did not consider the fact that genomes cluster around a common curve  @xcite , and thought of each of them as coming from an independent stochastic process with different parameters  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , choosing constant @xmath13 implies that for larger genomes the influx of new domain families is heavily dominant on the flux of duplicated domains .",
    "as noted by durrett and schweinsberg  @xcite , constant @xmath13 makes sense only if one thinks that new fold topologies emerge from an internal `` nucleation - like '' process with constant rate , rather than from an external flux .",
    "this process could be pictured as the genesis of new topologies from sequence mutation .",
    "empirically , while genesis events are reported  @xcite and must occur , it is clear that domain topologies are very stable , and the exploration of sequence space is not free , but conditioned by a number of additional important factors , including chromosomal position and expression patterns of genes , and their role in biological networks  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in prokaryotes , it is known that a large contribution to the innovation of coding genomes is provided by horizontal gene transfer  @xcite , the exchange of genetic material between species , which can be reasonably represented in a model as an external flux , as opposed to the internal nucleation process representing genesis .    for eukaryotes ,",
    "horizontal gene transfer is less important , and there can be multiple relevant innovation processes including exonization , loss of exons , alternative start sites changing the protein .",
    "we have not attempted to model the detailed processes leading to innovation , and because of their higher complexity in eukaryotes , we prefer to compare the model to the prokaryote data set alone . however , we can point out that in principle the same model has good agreement with the set of prokaryotes and eukaryotes together  @xcite . in eukaryotes ,",
    "the change in number of classes with respect to size change is generally small , but seems to have a trend that `` glues '' quite well with prokaryotes ( and in particular , innovation decreases with size ) .    motivated by the sublinear scaling of the number of domain classes , and taking into account in an effective way the role of processes that condition the addition of new domain topologies",
    ", we consider statistically _ dependent _ moves . on general grounds , if a genome is a complex system where sub - components interact in clusters and non - locally , domain topologies as well have to be coordinated with other parts of the system , so that it is reasonable that evolutionary moves are conditioned by what is already present , and that the actual number of domain topologies need not to be trivially an extensive quantity .",
    "the simplest way to implement this choice is to concentrate on the innovation process .",
    "let us consider the indicator @xmath18 , taking value @xmath19 if a new domain class is born at size @xmath4 , and value @xmath20 otherwise",
    ". the number of classes at size @xmath4 will be @xmath21 . if the random variables @xmath18 are independent and identically distributed , i.e.  @xmath22constant , @xmath6 follows a bernoulli distribution whose mean value is linear in @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 will be increasingly concentrated with increasing @xmath4 on the deterministic value @xmath13 .",
    "if vice versa the random variables @xmath18 are statistically dependent or also simply not identically distributed , the mean value may not be linear in @xmath4 , and the concentration phenomenon may not occur .",
    "both features , dependence and lack of concentration , are important . the former is necessary to obtain the observed sublinear behavior , the latter might create an intrinsic `` diversity '' in the genome ensemble , independently on the finite size of observed genomes ( however , the currently available data are insufficient to establish this empirically ) .",
    "we investigate this process using analytical asymptotic equations and simulations .",
    "we start by considering only growth moves , by duplication and innovation , postponing the inclusion of domain loss in the model .",
    "we will see that the resulting model contains the basic qualitative phenomenology of the scaling laws and can thus be regarded as the paradigmatic case .",
    "one can arrive at the defining equations with different arguments .",
    "a simple way is to assume that domain duplication is a rare event , described by a poisson distribution with characteristic time @xmath24 , during which there is a flux of external or new domain topologies @xmath25 . then @xmath26 . in this case the variables @xmath18 are independent but not identically distributed .",
    "it is immediate to verify that @xmath6 has mean value given by @xmath27 and thus grows as @xmath28 .",
    "the same result can be obtained by thinking of domain addition as a dependent move , conditioned on @xmath4 , @xmath6 or both .",
    "it is possible to consider different intermediate scenarios where the pool of old domain classes is in competition with the universe explorable by the new classes .",
    "the simplest scheme , which turns out to be quite general , can be obtained by choosing the conditional probability that a new class is born @xmath29 given the fact that @xmath30 at size @xmath4 @xmath31 hence @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "considering per - class duplication probability , one can choose the following expression , that asymptotically establishes the preferential attachment principle :    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 represents a characteristic number of domain classes needed for the preferential attachment principle to set in , and defines the behavior of @xmath6 for small @xmath4 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "@xmath38 is the most important parameter , which sets the scaling of the duplication / innovation ratio .",
    "intuitively , the smaller @xmath38 , the more the growth of @xmath39 is depressed with growing @xmath4 , and since @xmath13 is asymptotically proportional to the class density @xmath40 it is harder to add a new domain class in a larger , or more heavily populated genome . as we will see ,",
    "this implies @xmath41 as @xmath42 , corresponding to an increasingly subdominant influx of new fold classes at larger sizes .",
    "this choice reproduces the sublinear behavior for the number of classes and the other scaling laws described in properties ( i - iii ) .",
    "this kind of model has previously been explored in statistics under the name of pitman - yor , or chinese restaurant process ( crp )  @xcite , where it is known as one of the paradigmatic processes that generate partitions of elements into classes that are symmetric by swapping , or `` exchangeable '' .",
    "this process is used in bayesian inference and clustering problems  @xcite . in the chinese restaurant ( with table sharing ) parallel , individual domains correspond to customers and tables are domain classes .",
    "a domain belonging to a given class is a customer sitting at the corresponding table . in a duplication event ,",
    "a new customer is seated at a table with a preferential attachment principle , and in an innovation event , a new table is added .",
    "a simple mean - field treatment of the crp allows to access its scaling behavior .",
    "rigorous results for the probability distribution of the fold usage vector @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , are in good agreement with mean - field predictions .",
    "it is important to note that for this stochastic process , the usual large - deviation theorems do not hold , so that large-@xmath4 limit values of quantities such as @xmath45 do not converge to numbers , but rather to random variables  @xcite . despite of this non - self - average property , it is possible to understand the scaling of the averages @xmath11 and @xmath46 ( of @xmath7 and @xmath39 respectively ) at large @xmath4 , writing simple `` mean - field '' equations , for continuous @xmath4 .",
    "note that rigorously the mean value @xmath47 is still a random variable , function of the ( stochastic ) birth time @xmath9 of class @xmath8 .    from the definition of the model",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 @xmath49 these equations have to be solved with initial conditions @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",

    "this works as follows . from the solution",
    ", @xmath58 implies @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , so that the cumulative distribution can be estimated by the ratio of the ( average ) number of domain classes born before size @xmath61 and the number of classes born before size @xmath4 , @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 can be obtained by derivation of this function . for @xmath64 , and @xmath65",
    "small , we find @xmath66 for @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for @xmath55 .",
    "the above formulas indicate that the average asymptotic behavior of the distribution of domain class populations is a power law with exponent between @xmath19 and @xmath69 , in agreement with observation ( ii ) .",
    "in contrast , the behavior of the model of gerstein and coworkers  @xcite can be found in this framework by taking improperly @xmath70 , that is for constant @xmath71 .",
    "it gives a linearly increasing @xmath5 and a power - law distribution with asymptotic exponent @xmath69 for the domain classes .",
    "note that the phenomenology of the barabasi - albert preferential attachment scheme  @xcite is reproduced by a crp - like model where at each step a new domain class ( corresponding to the new network node ) with on average @xmath72 members ( the edges of the node ) is introduced , and at the same time @xmath72 domains are duplicated ( the edges connecting old nodes to the newly introduced one ) .",
    "it is possible to obtain the same results through a different route compared to the above reasoning , by writing the hierarchy of mean - field equations for @xmath0 , using a master equation - like approach .",
    "similarly as what happens for the zero - range process  @xcite , these equations contain source and sink terms governing the population dynamics of classes .",
    "duplications create a flux from classes with @xmath73 to classes with @xmath1 members , while only @xmath74 has a source term coming from the innovation move :    @xmath75    we consider the limit of large @xmath4 , and use the ansatz @xmath76 .",
    "this ansatz can be justified empirically and by simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1n ] , which compares this feature in empirical data and in simulations of different variants of the model .",
    "we have @xmath77 giving @xmath78    the solution of these equations is @xmath79 which can be estimated as @xmath80^{1+\\a } \\ \\ , \\ ] ] giving the result for the scaling of @xmath0 and its prefactor .",
    "going beyond scaling , the probability distributions generated by a crp contain large finite - size effects that are relevant for the experimental genome sizes . in this section",
    "we analyze the finite size effect affecting the distribution over the domain classes , obtained performing direct numerical simulations of different crp realizations .",
    "the simulations allow to measure @xmath5 , and @xmath0 for finite sizes , and in particular for values of @xmath4 that are comparable to those of observed genomes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphafit ] .",
    "the normalized distribution of the number of classes with @xmath1 domains over a genome of length @xmath4 reaches the theoretical distribution suggested by our model only in the asymptotic limit @xmath81 it is possible to obtain more information by studying the ratio of the asymptotic distribution and the distribution obtained from the crp simulation as shown in fig .",
    "[ sub : c1 ] .",
    "the plot shows that there is a value @xmath82 , depending on the size @xmath4 of the genome , beyond which the distribution is not anymore consistent with @xmath83 but shows exponential decay and large fluctuations .    in order to obtain a quantitative estimate of the deviation from scaling generating the cutoff",
    ", we define an order parameter as follows . using data obtained from the simulation as in fig .",
    "[ sub : c1 ] , we find the mean of the first 30 points of the plotted function and then compute the standard deviation @xmath84 by analyzing windows of @xmath85 points together .",
    "the cutoff is defined when @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a parameter .",
    "the result of this procedure can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sub : c2 ] .",
    "the cutoff shows a linear dependence from the genome length @xmath4 . to make sure the procedure does not depend too much on the number of iterations @xmath88 used to obtain the mean value of @xmath0",
    ", we performed it for different values of @xmath88 .",
    "as can be expected ( fig.[sub : cut_iter ] ) , more statistics is needed for probing the cutoff trend in those regions where the probability density function is very small .",
    "were it necessary to obtain from the distribution over domains @xmath4 an estimate of parameters for the underlying crp , one could decide to consider only data with @xmath89 . at the scales that are relevant for empirical data , finite - size corrections are substantial .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic behavior is typically reached for sizes of the order of @xmath90 , where the predictions of the mean - field theory are confirmed . comparing the histogram of domain occurrence for the mean - field solution of the model , simulations and data ,",
    "it becomes evident that the intrinsic cutoff set by @xmath4 causes the observed drift in the fitted exponent of the empirical distribution visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphafit ] .",
    "this means that the common behavior of the slopes followed by the population of domain classes for genomes of similar sizes can be ascribed to finite - size effects of a common underlying stochastic process .    beyond the linear cutoff ,",
    "the behavior of the distribution becomes realization - dependent due to the breaking of self - average  @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameter to disentangle the realization - dependence is @xmath39 .",
    "high-@xmath39 realizations have different tails of the distribution from low-@xmath39 ones , giving rise to the large fluctuations observed in fig .",
    "[ sub : c1 ] .",
    "thus , while the mean - field approach is successful in predicting the asymptotic scaling of the distribution @xmath0 , it does not capture the finite - size effects which can be observed in single realization of the crp process with finite @xmath4 and @xmath39 . beyond mean - field",
    "is possible to obtain more information by considering the sum of all crp trajectories conditioned to reaching configurations with given @xmath4 and @xmath39 .",
    "this enables a statistical - mechanical derivation of the normalized distribution of the number of domains with @xmath39 classes over a genome of length ( number of domains ) @xmath4 .",
    "since the focus here is on the mean - field approach , the calculation is described in a parallel work  @xcite .",
    "the above model does not describe evolutionary time in generations .",
    "conversely , it reproduces random ensembles of different genomes generated one from the other with the basic moves of duplication , innovation ( and loss , see below ) .",
    "it considers only events that are observed at a given @xmath4 , independently on when or why they happened in physical or biological time .",
    "genomes from the same realization can be thought of as a trivial tree of life , where each value of @xmath4 gives a new specie . in the case including domain deletions , more genomes of the same history can have the same size .",
    "in contrast , independent realizations are completely unrelated .",
    "the scaling laws in @xmath5 and @xmath0 hold for the typical realization , indicating that the scaling laws originate from the basic evolutionary moves and not from the fact that the species stem from a common tree with intertwined paths due to common evolutionary history .",
    "for example , two completely unrelated realizations will reach similar values of @xmath46 at the same value of @xmath4 .",
    "the data confirm this fact : phylogenetically distant bacteria with similar sizes have very similar number and population distribution of domain classes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : crpvspwl ] ) .    while the scaling laws are found independently on the realization of the chinese restaurant model , the uneven occurrence of domain classes can be seen as strongly dependent on common evolutionary history .",
    "averaging over independent realizations , the prediction of the crp is that the frequency of occurrence of any domain class would be equal , as no class is assigned a specific label . in the chinese restaurant metaphor",
    ", the customers only choose the tables on the basis of their population , and all the tables are equal for any other feature .    in order to capture this behavior with the model",
    ", one can consider the statistics of domain topology occurrence of a single realization , which is an extremely crude , but comparatively more realistic description of common ancestry .",
    "in other words , in this case , the classes that appear first are obviously more common among the genomes , and the qualitative phenomenology is restored , without the need of any adjustment in the model definition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occurrence ] ) .     to @xmath91 ( `` uniform '' ) ,",
    "i.e.  the range of sizes observed in the data , or directly for the set of empirical sizes of the genomes ( `` sampled '' ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "loss of genes , and thus of domains , is reported to occur frequently in genomes .",
    "we will discuss now variants of the model considering the introduction of a domain deletion , or loss rate .",
    "the question we ask is whether the introduction of domain loss , which we consider mainly as a perturbation , affects the qualitative behavior of the model , for example by generating different scaling behavior or phase transitions .",
    "we will see that the answer to all these questions is mostly negative even for non - infinitesimal perturbations , provided the loss rate is constant and does not scale itself with @xmath46 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main exception to this behavior is found when the loss probability of a domain depends on its own class size .",
    "we introduce domain loss through a new parameter @xmath87 , which defines a loss probability @xmath92 in two _ a priori _ different ways .",
    "( 1 ) we can distribute this probability equally among domains , so that the per - class loss probability is @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , the duplication and innovation probabilities @xmath12 and @xmath13 are rescaled by a factor @xmath94 . ( 2 ) we can also weigh the loss probability of a domain on its own class size , in the same way as domains are duplicated in the standard crp , so we obtain a per - class loss move with probability @xmath95 , giving a total @xmath96 and the rescaling of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we will see that model ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are not equivalent .    on technical grounds",
    ", the introduction of domain loss makes the stochastic process entirely different : @xmath4 is now a random variable , and all the observables that depend on it ( e.g.  @xmath5 ) are stochastic functions of this variable .",
    "another parameter , @xmath97 , describes the iterations of the model .",
    "operatively , we tackle the two models with the usual mean - field approach , writing equations for @xmath4 and @xmath46 of the kind @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and hence obtain the behavior as a function of @xmath4 by considering @xmath100 .",
    "the exact meaning of these equations is not straightforward .",
    "for example @xmath5 should represent the average on all histories passing by @xmath4 , but the differential equation strictly describes only the dependence of the observable from the actual value of the random variable @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , the predictions of this mean - field approach agree well with the results of simulations , indicating that these complications typically do not affect the behavior of the means .",
    "we will consider situations where , on average , genomes are not shrinking .    considering model ( 1 ) ,",
    "we can write the mean - field equations as @xmath101 @xmath102 where the sink term for @xmath46 derives from domain loss in classes with a single element , quantified by @xmath74 . since time does not count genome size , one has to consider the evolution of @xmath4 with time @xmath97 , given in this case by @xmath103 . in order to solve these expressions",
    ", we use the ansatz @xmath104 , and considering the limit in large @xmath4 .",
    "the ansatz is verified by simulations and holds also for empirical data , as previously shown ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1n ] ) .",
    "the first equation reads :    @xmath105 \\ \\ .\\ ] ]    the above equation gives the conventional scaling for @xmath5 and @xmath106 with @xmath38 replaced by @xmath107 , the correction resulting from the measured value of @xmath108 . by the use of computer simulations we notice that the @xmath108 coefficient tends to @xmath38 for infinite - size genomes ( fig .",
    "[ sub : c1a ] , [ sub : ara ] , and [ sub : an ] ) , so that the asymptotic trend of the equally distributed domain loss is identical to that of the standard crp .",
    "this behavior is independent from the chosen @xmath109 , as the asymptotic regime depends only on the growth of @xmath5 , governed by @xmath38 .",
    "when we analyze the domain distribution of finite - size genomes , we obtain the conventional results : the power - law depends on the genome size , but not on the value of @xmath87 ( fig .  [",
    "sub : ara ] and [ sub : qrd ] ) .",
    "this is explained considering the fact we are comparing runs with fixed genome size , thus with different number of moves , and we do not consider genomes that lose all their own domains .",
    "in fact biologically one can not trace the number of moves needed to reach a specific genome , but essentially we can observe only genomes in their actual state .",
    "more precise results can be obtained by the use of the mean field `` master equation '' approach sketched above . using the same ansatz @xmath110",
    ", we obtain the following hierarchy of equations for @xmath111 @xmath112 \\chi_j=(1-\\d)(j-1-\\a)\\chi_{j-1}+\\d    ( j+1)\\chi_{j+1 } \\ \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath113 .",
    "it is possible to estimate the solution of this system by taking a continuum limit as @xmath114- \\d\\partial_x \\chi(x)=0 \\ \\ , \\ ] ] which can be solved giving @xmath115 ^{1 + z } \\ \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath116 .",
    "we also find @xmath117 , which is consistent with the constraint @xmath118 since @xmath119 .",
    "it is then clear that the introduction of domain loss is equivalent to a rescaling of the parameter @xmath120 to @xmath121 , but in our case , @xmath122 asymptotically .",
    "the case @xmath123 has to be treated separately , but the behavior is similar ( fig .",
    "[ sub : qrd ] ) .",
    "a similar procedure is applicable to model ( 2 ) . in this case , however , the dependence of the effective death rate from @xmath4 can bring to an interesting change in the phenomenology , where @xmath124 can select the observed exponent @xmath125 and also determine a regime of linear growth for @xmath5 .    to understand this point",
    "we can consider the mean - field evolution of @xmath5 .",
    "this is determined asymptotically by the balance of a growth term @xmath126 and a loss term @xmath127 .",
    "with the usual ansatz this gives an asymptotic evolution equation of the kind @xmath128 with the usual definitions .",
    "simulations confirm the ansatz @xmath104 for this second model , which we will use in the mean - field reasoning . if @xmath5 is intensive , i.e.  asymptotically of order inferior to @xmath4 , the term @xmath129 can be neglected and this equation gives the scaling law @xmath130 , with @xmath131 .",
    "however , this equation has solution also if @xmath46 is order @xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath132 , and the term @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mortepes ] ) can not be neglected . in this case @xmath120 and @xmath124 determine the prefactor of the scaling law @xmath134 .    thus , there are two self - consistent mean - field asymptotic solutions , and we expect a transition between the two distinct behaviors",
    ". the existence of this transition is confirmed by simulations ( fig .",
    "[ sub : aramfa2 ] ) : at fixed @xmath124 , @xmath135 saturates to @xmath136 for larger values of this parameter . the transition point can be understood in mean - field as the intersection of the two solutions @xmath137 and @xmath138 at varying @xmath124 , and gives rise to a two - parameter `` phase - diagram '' separating the linear from the sublinear scaling of @xmath5 with @xmath4 , as shown in fig .  [ sub : fase ] .    in conclusion ,",
    "the mean - field approach is effective in exploring the effects of domain loss , which , under some general hypotheses , does not disrupt the basic phenomenology of the duplication - innovation model .",
    "specifically , there appear to be no qualitative changes introduced by a finite uniform loss rate , as long as this rate is constant with @xmath4 .",
    "a loss rate that is weighted as the innovation rate , instead , can induce an interesting transition from sublinear to linear scaling .",
    "thinking about the empirical system , no direct quantitative estimates are currently available regarding the domain loss rate as a function of genome size or number of classes .",
    "for this reason , it currently appears difficult to make a definite choice for this ingredient in the model .",
    "in the previous sections we analyzed models that make no distinction between domain topologies , but the latter are selected for duplication moves only on the basis of their population .",
    "it is then clear that they can reproduce the observed qualitative trends for the domain classes and their distributions with one common set of parameters for all genomes .",
    "one further question is to estimate the quantitative values of these parameters for the data .",
    "while the empirical slope of @xmath5 could be seen as more compatible with a model having @xmath139 , as its slope decays faster than a power law for large values of @xmath4 , the slopes of the power - law distribution of domain classes @xmath63 and their cutoff as a function of @xmath4 is in closer agreement to a crp with @xmath38 between 0.5 and 0.7  @xcite .",
    "those table colors can be set by any observable of interest . in our analysis",
    ", we considered the empirical occurrence of a domain topology as a label .",
    "indeed , the occurrence of a given domain class is determined by its biological function .",
    "for example , as expected , all the `` core '' biological functions such as translation of proteins and dna replication are performed by highly occurring domain topologies , since this machinery must be present in each genome .",
    "accordingly , these universal classes performing core functions have to appear preferentially earlier on in a model realization .",
    "this variant of the model is important for producing informed null models for the analysis of the empirical data , and , as we will see , shows the best agreement with respect to the scaling laws .     from the superfamily database with mean - field predictions and simulations of the model with class specificity .",
    "comparison between @xmath140dependence of powerlaw fit ( lines in blue ) and universality of the two parameters from our model .",
    "two letters identify each genome , whose full name can be found in appendix ( table  [ genname ] ) .",
    "simulations ( lines in gray ) from our model use the same values @xmath141 and @xmath142 . ]",
    "we will introduce the variant with class specificity by coupling the crp model to a simple genetic algorithm able to select between innovation moves that choose different classes .",
    "let us first introduce some notation to parametrize domain class occurrence .",
    "we define the matrices @xmath143 where : @xmath144 it is possible to consider the mean taken along the matrix columns , @xmath145 where the label `` emp '' means that this value is obtained from empirical data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occurrence ] ) .",
    "generically , a genetic algorithm requires a representation of the space of solution @xmath146 and a function @xmath147 that tests the quality of the solution computed . in our case ,",
    "the former is simply the genome obtained from the a crp step , parametrized by @xmath143 .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath148 the value of the above scoring function taken over simulated genomes measures how much the set of domain classes they possess agrees with experimental data ( in this case on occurrence ) and enables to compare different `` virtual '' crp moves .",
    "note that in this variant , since the empirical domain topologies are a finite set , domain classes are also finite . as a consequence ,",
    "tables with a given tablecloth are extracted without replacement , affecting the pool of available colors .",
    "as we will see , this is an important requirement to obtain agreement with the data , as it determines the saturation of the function @xmath5 also for large values of @xmath120 .",
    "we will discuss the role of an infinite pool in the following subsection .",
    "also , as anticipated , domain classes have different `` color '' , or in mathematical terms the exchangeability of the process is lost .",
    "classes are drawn from the set of the residual ones with uniform probability .",
    "genomes @xmath149 and @xmath150 are compared through the function @xmath152 and the highest score one will be the genome @xmath153 so that @xmath154 . in these conditions ,",
    "the rigorous results present in the literature for the crp cease to be valid .",
    "it is still possible , however , to analyze the behavior of this variant by the mean - field approach adopted here , and to compare with simulations .",
    "since the selection rule chooses strictly the maximum , it is essentially able to distinguish the sign of @xmath155 only .",
    "for this reason , it is sufficient to account for the positivity ( which we label by `` + '' ) and negativity ( `` - '' ) of this function for a given domain index @xmath8 .",
    "this means that , with the simplification of two virtual moves only , the model introduces only one extra effective parameter , i.e.  the ratio of the `` universal '' ( positive @xmath156 ) to the `` contextual '' ( negative @xmath156 ) domain classes .    in order to write the mean - field equations for this model variant",
    ", we first have to classify all the possible outcomes of the virtual crp moves . the genomes @xmath149 and @xmath150 proposed by the crp proliferation step can have the same ( labeled by `` @xmath19 '' ) , higher ( `` @xmath157 '' ) or lower ( `` @xmath158 '' ) score than their parent , depending on @xmath12 , @xmath13 and by the probabilities to draw a universal or contextual domain family , @xmath159 and @xmath160 respectively . using these labels ,",
    "the scheme of the possible states and their outcome in the selection step is given in table  [ tab : moves ] ."
