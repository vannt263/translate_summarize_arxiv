    "classical be stars are rapidly rotating , near main sequence b - type stars which show or have shown hydrogen balmer emission @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that be stars have gaseous , geometrically thin circumstellar disks ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "as summarized in @xcite , numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain how circumstellar disks may form around classical be stars , including the wind - compressed disk ( wcd ) model @xcite , the magnetically torqued wind - compressed disk model @xcite , and processes related to non - radial pulsations of the stellar photosphere @xcite , yet none have been completely successful in explaining the observed phenomena .",
    "beginning with the work of @xcite , it has often been speculated that the fundamental source of the be phenomenon is tied to the rapid rotation of these stars : the canonical assertion is that classical be stars rotate at v@xmath1/v@xmath2 @xmath3 70 - 80% of their critical velocity @xcite .",
    "however , recent theoretical work incorporating the effects of equatorial gravity darkening into studies of rotation rates @xcite suggests there is a degeneracy in the measurement of rotation rates such that increasing v@xmath1 from 80% to 100% of the critical velocity has no effect on observed line widths .",
    "thus classical be stars may actually be rotating at or near their critical breakup velocity . alternatively",
    ", @xcite suggest that a subset of classical be stars might be rotating at sub - critical rates as low as 0.4 - 0.6 v@xmath2 .",
    "studying stars from the bright star catalog @xcite and its supplement @xcite , @xcite found that the mean frequency of be stars with respect to normal b stars was @xmath317% in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite also found that the peak frequency occurred for spectral type b1 , where 34% of b stars were be stars , and noted no difference in frequencies between giant , dwarf , and subgiant type b stars .",
    "it should be noted however that the reliability of bright star catalog spectral types is often questionable .",
    "early studies also concluded that galactic be stars were present from the zero - age - main - sequence to the terminal - age main sequence @xcite .",
    "due in part to the advent of ccds , systematic studies of the be populations of star clusters and associations have expanded past our galaxy to include the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "these extragalactic survey programs have typically used 2-color diagram ( 2-cds ) photometric techniques to identify the frequency of b - type stars exhibiting excess h@xmath0 emission ( `` be stars '' ) relative to normal b - type stars in stellar associations and clusters .",
    "general trends in the fractional be content of a cluster as a function of its age and/or metallicity have been observed , leading to suggestions that secondary mechanisms , besides rapid rotation , might influence the development of be circumstellar disks .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found that the frequency of the be phenomenon seems to peak in clusters with a main sequence turn - off of b1-b2 , leading to the suggestion that the be phenomenon is related to a star s evolutionary age .",
    "@xcite suggested the be phenomenon will start to develop only in the second half of a b star s main sequence lifetime , owing to structural changes in the star .",
    "specifically , @xcite noted that be star - disk systems should start to appear in clusters 10 myr old , corresponding to the mid - point main sequence lifetime of b0 stars @xcite , and their frequency should peak in clusters 13 - 25 myr old , corresponding to the mid - point main sequence lifetime of b1-b2 stars @xcite .",
    "curiously , @xcite claimed to detect numerous be stars in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) cluster ngc 346 , which has an age between 2.6 myr @xcite and 5 myr @xcite ; this result seems to conflict with fabregat & torrejon s assertion .",
    "@xcite also suggested that numerous classical be stars might be present in the young cluster ngc 6611 ; however , it is possible that these objects are pre - main - sequence herbig ae / be stars @xcite .",
    "numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain this apparent evolutionary effect , including structural changes within the central star @xcite , an evolutionary spin - up of the central star @xcite , and spin - up due to mass - transfer in binary systems @xcite .",
    "several photometric studies @xcite have suggested that the be phenomenon may be more prevalent in low metallicity environments , based on comparisons of the apparent fractional be populations of galactic , large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and smc clusters .",
    "iue , hst , and fuse observations @xcite show that stars tend to have lower wind velocities in metal poor environments .",
    "the wcd model @xcite suggests that reducing terminal wind velocities would increase the likelihood that a b star experiencing mass - loss would be able to retain this matter in the form of a circumstellar disk , although @xcite claim non - radial line forces may inhibit such a scenario .",
    "@xcite suggests that the increase in the frequency of be stars in low metallicity environments is related to the presence of a greater number of rapidly rotating stars in these locations , owing to a reduced coupling of the magnetic field and the young stellar object ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the accuracy of these initial interpretations is hampered by numerous factors .",
    "@xcite note that the photometric surveys used by many to identify be stars only detect be stars with high levels of emission , and likely miss weak emitters .",
    "furthermore , since be stars are known variables which can experience active and quiescent stages @xcite , it is likely that some be stars in a cluster might be in a quiescent stage and hence not identified as be stars by these techniques .",
    "this possibility has been demonstrated by various followup investigations @xcite , which do not detect 100% of previously identified be stars in certain clusters ; additionally , a significant number of previously unidentified be stars are uncovered in these studies .",
    "@xcite note some spurious detections in photometrically identified be stars located in crowded cluster cores .",
    "even some spectroscopically identified be stars @xcite have been shown to be spurious detections caused by the presence of diffuse background h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "the number of clusters with accurately determined be frequencies is still limited , especially regarding smc clusters , thus small number statistics become important when attempting to draw broad conclusions from the literature data set .    in this paper , we provide a significant increase in the number of extragalactic clusters whose candidate be populations have been identified photometrically . in section 2 , we outline our observations and data reduction techniques . in section 3",
    ", we detail our identification of candidate be stars in 8 smc , 5 lmc , and 3 galactic clusters . we offer a detailed discussion of how these results may shed insight into the role age and/or metallicity play in the development of the be phenomenon in section 4 .",
    "our photometry was obtained at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 0.9 m telescope using the direct imaging ccd , a 2048 x 2046 multi - amplifier ccd , operated in the quad amplifier mode . with the f/13.5 secondary , we recorded data over a field of view of 13@xmath4.5 x 13@xmath4.5 with a pixel scale of 0@xmath5396 pixel@xmath6 .",
    "we used ctio s standard @xmath7 x @xmath7 b ( @xmath8 = 4201 , @xmath9 = 1050 ) , v ( @xmath8 = 5475 , @xmath9 = 1000 ) , r ( @xmath8 = 6425 , @xmath9 = 1500 ) , and h@xmath0 ( @xmath8 = 6563 , @xmath9 = 75 ) filters .",
    "a summary of our observations along with relevant cluster information is given in table [ allsum ] .",
    "overscan correction , image trimming , bias correction , and flat fielding of the data were achieved using standard iraf techniques .    to calibrate to the standard b , v , r system , we obtained photometry of 3 - 4 standard fields , identified by @xcite , per night .",
    "the observations were not made under photometric conditions .",
    "aperture photometry was performed for all standard stars using an aperture radius of 12 pixels .",
    "transformations were derived from least - squares fits to the following equations @xmath10",
    "@xmath11 @xmath12 where x is the airmass and the lowercase letters indicate instrumental magnitudes in each filter .",
    "the transformation coefficients for each night are given in table [ trans ] .",
    "given our limited number of observations of standard fields , we found it necessary to hold the the coefficient for the airmass term constant to achieve a reasonable transformation .",
    "as we are only interested in differential photometric results , this should not adversely affect the analysis of our data .",
    "similarly , we did not calibrate our h@xmath0 photometry to an absolute scale or calibrate for extinction as we were only interested in differential photometric results .",
    "due to the crowded nature of most of our clusters , unless otherwise noted , final cluster photometry was obtained using standard iraf point - spread function ( psf ) fitting techniques .",
    "the fwhm of typical point sources varied in a non - linear manner across the chip , thus we used a second order psf function .",
    "background sky levels were determined using mode statistics of an annulus of inner radius @xmath13 having a width of @xmath14 . since the psf photometry routine used an aperture size , given by the average fwhm of stars in an image , which was much smaller than the 12 pixel radius used for the photometry of the standard fields , an aperture correction was applied .    achieving excellent absolute photometric accuracy was not an inherent goal of this study ; nonetheless , for each of our fields of view we compared our measured photometry of several bright sources to published values ( cross - listed in simbad or @xcite ) to search for signs of egregious systematic errors .",
    "our ngc 2186 photometry was the only data which exhibited any evidence of systematic errors ; these data are consistently @xmath31 v - band magnitude fainter than the photometric values cross - listed in simbad .",
    "these data were taken through clouds , thus the cause of the observed systematic error is likely related to the incomplete modeling of these effects via our observations of standard star fields .",
    "we do not believe that these errors in the absolute photometry of ngc 2186 significantly affected our interpretation of the cluster s differential photometric behavior .",
    "after completing the photometry measurements for all of our data , we organized our observations of each cluster into groups of short , medium , and deep b , v , r , h@xmath0 exposures ( see table [ allsum ] ) .",
    "note that multiple listings of h@xmath0 exposures in a single grouping indicate that two separate h@xmath0 images were obtained to allow for co - addition of results and hence lower errors .",
    "repetitive listings of individual targets in the short , medium , and deep exposures were identified and the observation having the lowest b - band error was selected for use in this study .",
    "finally , the photometric data were transformed into the standard system using the transformation coefficients listed in table [ trans ] .",
    "following the techniques employed by grebel , keller , and others in the literature , we used a simple 2 color diagram ( 2-cd ) technique to identify the candidate be star populations in our clusters .",
    "first , the b , v , r , and h@xmath0 photometry of all stars in a cluster were plotted on a 2-cd , as illustrated in figure [ 2cd ] .",
    "normal blue main sequence stars and most blue supergiants clumped in one section of this diagram , e.g. at @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) = -5.7 in figure [ 2cd ] , while red main sequence and red supergiant stars associated in another region , e.g. at @xmath17 and @xmath16 ) = -5.7 in figure [ 2cd ] .",
    "blue stars which showed excess h@xmath0 emission , e.g. @xmath18 in figure [ 2cd ] , were designated _ candidate _",
    "three criteria were used to delineate candidate be stars from other astrophysical objects : ( b - v ) colors , ( r - h@xmath0 ) colors , and m@xmath19 magnitudes .",
    "our choice of maximum ( b - v ) colors delineating candidate be stars from other astrophysical objects was based on the possible range of colors of classical be stars in our clusters .",
    "b - type stars of luminosity class iii to v should exhibit unreddened ( b - v ) colors of -0.3 @xmath20 ( b - v ) @xmath20 @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "classical be disks can further redden the observed ( b - v ) colors by a few tenths of a magnitude @xcite ; furthermore , interstellar reddening , as measured by the mean e(b - v ) of our clusters ( see table [ allsum ] ) , will also redden the aforementioned nominal color range .",
    "however , this mean e(b - v ) does not accurately characterize the reddening experienced by all cluster members .",
    "for example , while @xcite cite a mean e(b - v ) of 0.09 for lh 72 , individual targets were observed to have e(b - v ) values ranging from 0.04 to 0.22 .",
    "thus some cluster objects may experience an additional reddening of about the same order as the quoted cluster mean e(b - v ) .",
    "the ( b - v ) color cutoffs we used to identify candidate be stars were ( -0.3 + x + y + z ) @xmath20 ( b - v ) @xmath20 ( @xmath30 + x + y + z ) ; where x represents the amount of reddening from be disks ( @xmath30.2 ) , y is the mean e(b - v ) for each cluster , and z incorporates the possible affects of additional patchy interstellar reddening ( 1 times the quoted mean e(b - v ) ) . we stress that these cutoffs are only approximations meant to identify likely candidate be stars ; follow - up observations of these targets , especially the few which lie on the borders of our chosen cutoffs , will be needed to confirm their status as bona - fide classical be stars .",
    "we will discuss individual ( b - v ) cutoffs for each of our clusters in the following subsections .",
    "the choice of ( r - h@xmath0 ) colors delineating candidate be stars from normal main sequence stars is somewhat arbitrary , and there is no systematic cutoff used throughout the myriad of literature studies which use 2-cds to investigate classical be populations .",
    "@xcite recently introduced an analysis technique based on synthetic photometry and empirical colors to alleviate such concerns , but this technique has yet to be widely adopted .",
    "when assigning minimum ( r - h@xmath0 ) cutoffs to our clusters , we tried to ensure that our candidates showed noticeably more excess h@xmath0 emission than likely main sequence stars which had slightly redder ( b - v ) colors than those expected for b - type stars . given the typical @xmath21 of less than 0.10 and the sometimes considerable dispersion present in the blue and red main sequence clumps , we suggest that our chosen @xmath16 ) cutoffs dividing blue main sequence stars from candidate be stars represent a conservative estimate of candidate be star populations . as expected , and as noted by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , such a division will tend to exclude the detection of candidate be stars which exhibit low levels of balmer emission .    as a final constraint , we also ensured that the apparent magnitudes of candidate be stars in each of our clusters coincided with those expected for b - type stars of luminosity class iii - v . using the distances and reddening values for our clusters ,",
    "we determined the upper ( using b0iii m@xmath19 = -5.1 , @xcite ) and lower ( using a0v m@xmath19 = 0.65 , @xcite ) limits of expected apparent magnitudes for candidate be stars in our clusters .    results for individual clusters are discussed below and summarized in table [ photsum ] .",
    "photometric data for each candidate be star identified in this study , as well as astrometric coordinates accurate to @xmath20 0.3 arc - seconds , are compiled in table [ photdetails ] .",
    "note that the reliability of each candidate be star detection in each cluster was double - checked via inspection of each candidate s contour plot and radial profile in multiple filters using iraf .",
    "a number of initial detections located within dense pockets of h ii nebular emission were disregarded as we believed their detection was the result of spurious background noise .",
    "we also identified numerous objects which we classified as `` possible detections '' ( see column 10 in table [ photdetails ] ) . due to either their location in dense h ii regions or possible nearby stellar contamination , we suggest these objects be observed with secondary techniques , such as polarimetry or spectroscopy , to confirm or discount their possible status as classical be stars .",
    "note that data tabulated within parentheses in table [ photsum ] include both `` firm '' detections and `` possible '' detections of candidate be stars .",
    "based on the finder chart in @xcite , we defined the cluster size of bruck 60 to be a circle of diameter @xmath22 .",
    "candidate be stars were identified as stars on the 2-cd ( see figure [ 2cd ] ) with @xmath23 , @xmath18 , and m@xmath19 @xmath24 13.9 .",
    "we identified 26 candidate be stars based upon this selection criteria , with 5 of these ( bruck 60:wbbe 7 , 21 , 23 , 25 , and 26 ) being classified as `` possible detections '' .",

    "2-cds will be available in the online version of the journal . from an inspection of bruck 60 s cmd , as well as",
    "those for our other clusters , one can see that our candidate be stars sometimes lie redward of the main sequence by ( b - v ) @xmath30.1 .",

    "129 candidate be stars were identified using the criteria @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "note that ngc 371:wbbe 2 is 0.16 magnitudes too bright to be a b0iii - b0v type star , given the distance modulus , r@xmath19 , and e(b - v ) of the cluster .",
    "however , follow - up polarimetric observations of this target @xcite clearly demonstrate that it is a classical be star .",

    "coordinates , we were unable to make firm correlations between the data sets , and we suggest two explanations . as discussed in the introduction , be stars are variable stars known to periodically enter quiescent phases in which they lose most or all of their circumstellar disks . thus it is not unexpected that we might identify a different set of candidate be stars than those identified from a previous epoch .",
    "lh 72 also resides in a region of significant h@xmath0 nebulosity .",
    "it is likely that both @xcite and the present study mis - identified a small number of candidate be stars due to spurious detections induced by this diffuse , heterogeneous background .",

    "given the suggested multiple epochs of star formation in ngc 1850 ( see section 3.3.2 ) , we designated this cluster as `` old ? ''",
    "we have included all photometrically identified candidate be stars in table [ photspectypesum ] , including those classified as `` possible detections '' in table [ photsum ] .",
    "we have combined the results of table [ photspectypesum ] into two bins : `` early - type '' candidate be stars , corresponding to rough spectral types b0-b3 , and `` later - type '' candidate be stars , corresponding to rough spectral types b4-b5 .",
    "the results of this binning are given in table [ earlylate ] , and we suggest that such averages should mask the general level of uncertainty associated with the spectral types we have assigned .",

    "the standard deviation errors quoted in table [ earlylate ] were calculated assuming the data followed a binomial distribution . we have also averaged the fractional be content , binned to early- and later - type stars , of clusters having like age and metallicity properties , as summarized in table [ agezstats ] .",
    "the uncertainties quoted in this table merely represent the propagation of the previously calculated standard deviations , i.e. @xmath77 = n@xmath78 ( @xmath79 + @xmath80 + ... ) @xmath81 .",
    "we first examined our dataset to identify any trends in the fractional candidate be content as a function of metallicity . following the work of @xcite , we first considered the fractional early - type ( b0-b3 ) be content of `` young '' clusters having ages of 7.0 @xmath20 log ( t ) @xmath20 7.4 .",
    "data matching these criteria in table [ earlylate ] are plotted in figure [ midagez ] , where open circles correspond to literature data , filled circles correspond to data presented in this study , and crosses represent the average of all clusters fractional be content within a metallicity bin .",
    "it is possible to find a wide range of reported metallicities for many of the individual clusters presented in this survey , as noted by @xcite ; hence , following their example , we have chosen to represent all smc clusters with one average metallicity and all lmc clusters with another average metallicity value .",
    "we also follow the practice of @xcite of assigning single , average metallicity values to both galactic clusters located exterior and interior to the solar location ( see figure [ midagez ] ) .",
    "we recognize that this is an oversimplification , but given the large scatter in the current available values for individual cluster metallicities , it seems the best approach at present .    from figure [ midagez ] ,",
    "it is clear that there exists a wide range of be / ( b + be ) ratios within each metallicity bin .",
    "the systematic errors inherent in the use of the 2-cd technique undoubtedly contribute to this scatter ; differences in the environmental properties of specific individual clusters also might influence the observed scatter of fractional be content .",

    "while figure [ averagedz ] shows the same general trend depicted by @xcite , we believe that the improved statistics provided by the present study significantly strengthens the claim of a trend with metallicity .",
    "the trend claimed by @xcite was based upon the observation of one cluster in the smc metallicity bin of z=0.002 .",
    "the present study s use of 4 smc clusters reduces the average fractional be content within this metallicity bin from 39% @xcite to 32% .",
    "we must note that our results are not inconsistent with the general conclusion reached by @xcite , who found no evidence of a metallicity trend in their study of galactic clusters .",
    "as seen in figure [ averagedz ] , we also observe little convincing evidence of a trend over the smaller metallicity range probed by galactic clusters ; however , evidence of a metallicity trend develops when one extends surveys to include broader regions of metallicity space , such as the lmc and smc .",
    "if one assumes that the fractional be content of clusters depends on metallicity , then such a trend also should be apparent when examining clusters in age denominations other than `` young '' clusters .",
    "we have plotted the average fractional early - type be content of `` very young '' clusters , depicted as open triangles , and `` old '' clusters , depicted as open squares , in figure [ averagedz ] .",
    "although the quality of available data for these age groups is severely limited , and no data exist for galactic clusters , we suggest that the `` very young '' and `` old '' cluster data plotted in figure [ averagedz ] are not inconsistent with the be phenomenon being more prevalent in low metallicity environments .",
    "we do recognize , however , that there is still some controversy over the metallicity effect .",
    "for example , the results of @xcite find a be fraction in the lmc cluster ngc 2004 which is about the same as the standard galactic value of 17% . to resolve these lingering uncertainties",
    ", we strongly suggest that additional observations of clusters in these extreme age ranges must be made , spanning a wide range of metallicities , in order to provide the statistics necessary to more definitively identify any trend present",
    ".      inspection of tables [ photspectypesum ] , [ earlylate ] , and [ agezstats ] clearly reveal that we have found a substantial number of candidate be stars in clusters ranging in age from 5 myr to 8 myr . from table",
    "[ photspectypesum ] , it is clear that these young clusters not only contain b0 type candidate be stars , but they also have a significant number of later - type candidate be objects . if the be phenomenon develops in the second half of a b star s main sequence lifetime , we would not expect to find b0 type stars , let alone b4-b5 type stars , in these very young clusters .",
    "furthermore , the average fractional candidate be content in these very young clusters , detailed in table [ agezstats ] , is similar to the nominal frequency of the be phenomenon in the galaxy of 17% @xcite .",
    "clearly our present understanding of how the be phenomenon is related to a star s evolutionary age would be altered if we could establish that these very young _ candidate _ be stars were not remnant pre - main - sequence star - disk systems .",
    "the similarities between the fractional candidate be population found in these very young clusters with respect to the nominal frequency of the be phenomenon observed in the galaxy is interesting .",
    "classical be stars of such a young age clearly would not have spent enough time on the main sequence to significantly spin - up via the mechanism proposed by @xcite , or via mass transfer in a binary system @xcite .",
    "since it is widely accepted that the be phenomenon is inherently tied to rapid rotation , our data seem to suggest that stars emerging from their pre - main - sequence phase must possess a wide range of rotational velocities ; namely , a significant number of objects must be rotating near their critical breakup velocities at the zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) .",
    "we will explore the true nature of many of these extremely young candidate be stars in a later paper .    from table",
    "[ agezstats ] , it is clear that the fractional early - type be content of `` young '' clusters is significantly higher than the nominal frequency of the be phenomenon ( 17% ) ; furthermore , the fractional later - type be content of these clusters is significantly lower than the early - type content . examining the fractional early- and later - type",
    "be content of `` old '' clusters in tables [ earlylate ] and [ agezstats ] , we also find evidence that the be phenomenon in these clusters is more prevalent than the nominal value of 17% .",
    "it is unclear from our dataset whether there is any difference between the frequency of early - type and later - type be stars in these old clusters .",
    "our detection of early - type objects in `` old '' clusters is very curious , and we can not find a simple explanation in the literature which explains why such objects would be detected .",
    "the slight enhancement of the fractional later - type be content in our old clusters and the much larger enhancement of the fractional early - type be content in our young clusters supports previous suggestions that the be phenomenon is more prevalent in the later stages of a b star s main sequence lifetime @xcite .",
    "recall however , that the results from our very young clusters indicate that such an evolutionary effect _ may not _ be the sole mechanism responsible for the development of the be phenomenon .",
    "we now consider the mechanisms which might be responsible for the observed evolutionary effect in the be phenomenon .",
    "the detection of a sizable fraction of candidate be stars in clusters younger than 10 myr suggest that stars emerging onto the zams might display a wide range of rotational rates , including stars which are rotating near their critical breakup velocity , hence exhibiting the be phenomenon .",
    "the theoretical models of @xcite and @xcite illustrate that the ratio of angular velocity to critical angular velocity ( @xmath82 / @xmath83 ) steadily increases throughout the main sequence lifetime of early - type b stars , which these authors suggest might explain why the be phenomenon is more prevalent in the later part of a b star s main sequence lifetime . while we agree that the general notion of an evolutionary spin - up provides a reasonable explanation for most of the observational properties documented here and in the literature",
    ", we also consider some of other implications of meynet s and maeder s models .",
    "table [ lifetimes ] lists the main sequence lifetimes predicted by the models of @xcite and @xcite for rotating and non - rotating stars .",
    "interestingly , stars starting with an enhanced rotation rate on the zams will experience a longer main sequence lifetime than stars of similar mass which start with a small or null rotation rate .",
    "recall that the fundamental underlying mechanism believed to differentiate classical be stars from `` normal '' b - type objects is rapid rotation .",
    "we speculate that the different main sequence lifetimes experienced by rapidly rotating versus slowly rotating b - type stars might influence the observed enhancement of the be phenomenon in the later stages of a star s main sequence lifetime . consider a smc cluster of age 25 myr , which table [ lifetimes ] suggests will only have b3 or later - type `` normal b stars '' remaining on the main sequence , assuming they started on the zams as slow rotators .",
    "in addition to b3 or later - type rapidly rotating classical be stars , b2 type classical be stars will also still reside on the main sequence when the cluster is 25 myr old .",
    "hence , the fractional be content derived for this cluster via the 2-color diagram technique will not be comparing be to normal b stars of a similar range of spectral types .",
    "the additional presence of b2 type be stars in this cluster might inflate the observed fractional be content .",
    "since clusters younger than 10 myr old should still have their entire b0-b9 sequence present on the main sequence , regardless of whether one considers rapidly or non - rapidly rotating stars , we expect no enhancement of the be phenomenon due to this effect .",
    "conversely , we would expect that the expansion of main sequence lifetimes due to rotation will greatly affect clusters in the 16 - 26 myr age range . in these clusters , `` normal '' b1-b2 stars which were slowly rotating",
    "when they reached the zams would have evolved off of the main sequence .",
    "b1-b2 type classical be stars , which were rotating much more rapidly when they reached the zams , will still be observable on the main sequence , hence b1-b2 and b3-later type be stars will be detected via 2-cds .",
    "because the be phenomenon is most prevalent amongst b1-b2 type stars , one might expect a very large enhancement of the be phenomenon to be detected in these clusters .",
    "when one considers the fractional be content of older clusters , the be phenomenon would likely still be enhanced by this effect , but to a lesser degree than clusters 16 - 26 myr old , as the prevalence of the be phenomenon is lower in later spectral types .",
    "our data are consistent with this speculative scenario .",
    "no strong enhancement in the be phenomenon is seen in our very young clusters , while moderate and strong enhancements in the be phenomenon are seen in our old and young clusters respectively . from table",
    "[ agezstats ] , one might question why we observe early - type objects in our `` old '' clusters .",
    "we would expect that most slowly rotating early - type stars should have evolved off of the main sequence in these clusters",
    ". a limited number of early - type classical be stars might still reside on the main sequence , owing to the extended main sequence lifetime afforded to rapid rotators .",
    "it is a little more difficult to explain the nature of early - type non - be stars detected in these clusters ; however , it is possible that these objects are blue stragglers .",
    "note that the binary scenario for the formation of be stars predicts that some should appear as blue stragglers @xcite ; hence , if `` normal '' b - type blue stragglers populate these clusters , some of the clusters be population may have their origin linked to binarity , not the suggested extension of main sequence lifetimes .",
    "it is clear that additional observations are needed to investigate the nature of both the early - type candidate be stars and normal b stars in such `` old '' clusters .",
    "differentiating between an enhancement in the be phenomenon which is due to the spin - up of stars as they evolve along the main sequence versus an extension of the main sequence lifetime in rapidly rotating stars will likely be a difficult task .",
    "of course , it is entirely possible that both mechanisms could play a role in producing the observed enhancements .",
    "one could examine the statistical distribution of rotational velocities of early - type versus later - type b stars in clusters spanning a range of ages to look for evidence of a systematic spin - up of the overall distribution with age .",
    "conversely , if one could find numerous classical be stars in a cluster having earlier spectral types than all of the normal main sequence stars present , this would provide evidence that the extended main sequence lifetimes of rapid rotators might contribute to the observed enhancements of the be phenomenon . in practice ,",
    "measuring the spectral types of classical be stars to high accuracy is difficult , so this later type of observational undertaking would likely be challenging .",
    "we also used the calibration of @xcite to assign crude spectral types to the candidate be stars we identified in our galactic clusters ( see table [ galacticspectypes ] ) . due to",
    "the large uncertainty in the distance to ngc 2383 , we have not attempted to convert the observed apparent magnitudes of this cluster s candidate be stars into spectral types .",
    "recall that our ngc 2186 photometry includes systematic errors which make our targets appear @xmath31 magnitude too faint ; to correct for these systematics , we have applied a 1 magnitude offset to our data to compute the spectral types listed in table [ galacticspectypes ] . as discussed in section 3.3.3 , we detected 4 of 5 previously identified be stars in ngc 2439 via our 2-cd and 1 previously undetected candidate",
    "spectral types for two of the known be stars are given in @xcite : star white @xmath84 @xcite is a b2 v , which generally agrees with our rough b0 classification of this object ( ngc 2439:wbbe 1 in table [ photdetails ] ) , and star white @xmath85 @xcite is a b1 v , which generally agrees with our rough b0 classification of this star ( ngc 2439:wbbe 2 in table [ photdetails ] ) .",
    "as previously described , we have detected elhc # 1,3,4,6,7,8,12,13 , and 19 as candidate emission - line objects via 2-cds and failed to detect elhc 5 , 11 , and 20 .",
    "this 75% detection rate offers supporting evidence that elhc stars might be bonafide pre - main - sequence objects .",
    "recent low - resolution spectroscopic and jhk photometric observations of some of these elhcs @xcite have revealed that some objects might have nearby , previously unresolved neighbors ; furthermore , the lack of a strong near ir excess and lack of forbidden emission lines has led these authors to question whether many of these elhcs are truly herbig ae / be stars or whether they are classical be stars .    with respect to our results , we also had noted that elhc 11 seemed to be comprised of 2 components .",
    "the low - resolution spectroscopy of elhc 11 and 20 , which were both not detected as emission - line objects in our study , revealed these sources to have h@xmath0 absorption lines slightly filled in with emission @xcite . because the 2-cd technique fails to detect weak h@xmath0 emitters , it is not surprising that we failed to detect these objects",
    ". based on these results , we would predict that when spectroscopic observations of elhc 5 are made , they will also reveal a partially filled in absorption line at h@xmath0 . in a future publication , we will present the results of moderate resolution spectroscopic and near - ir photometric observations of many of these elhc stars which were obtained to further probe the true nature of these objects .",
    "we briefly discussed some of the known limitations of the 2-cd technique in the introduction , and now consider this situation in more detail .",
    "the 2-cd technique typically assumes that all stars within an appropriate range of colors that have a ( r - h@xmath0 ) magnitude in excess of some threshold are `` be stars '' .",
    "however , as many galactic o , b , and a type supergiants are known to show frequent h@xmath0 emission , one expects that the detection of such objects via the 2-cd technique would artificially inflate the number of detected `` be stars '' .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained follow - up spectroscopy of star s132 in the lmc cluster lh 72 , which they identified as a be star from a 2-cd , and classified this object as a b8 ia star .",
    "the luminosity class of s132 excludes it , by definition , from being a classical be star .",
    "similarly , @xcite identified ngc 346:kwbbe 13 as a `` be star '' via a 2-color diagram .",
    "unfortunately this object is the well known hd 5980 wolf - rayet / luminous blue variable system , thus it is abundantly clear that it has been mis - classified by the simple 2-cd method as a ( classical ) `` be star '' . in principle , one would expect that the location of these objects on a cmd would identify them as `` contaminants '' ; however , this is clearly not always the case .",
    "it is possible that these stars are background objects with respect to the clusters with which they have been associated .",
    "it is also possible that a significant amount of their radiation is attenuated by a localized region of dust .",
    "these two examples demonstrate that it is not unreasonable to expect oba supergiants to `` contaminate '' 2-cd detections .",
    "we suggest the frequency of contamination by such objects is likely to be greater when one uses the 2-cd technique to investigate field star populations @xcite , compared to cluster populations , as the evolutionary age of a cluster population should restrict the range of spectral types of oba supergiants present .",
    "recent follow - up low - resolution spectroscopic and near ir photometric observations of some elhcs @xcite have raised issues with their classification as herbig ae / be objects . even assuming the most pessimistic interpretation of the results of @xcite , i.e. that elhc 7 is the only true herbig ae / be star of these candidates as it is the only one which exhibits a large near ir excess , the implications of these results regarding the proper interpretation of 2-cds can not be ignored .",
    "we detected elhc 7 on a 2-cd as being an excess h@xmath0 emitter ; therefore , we have solid evidence that herbig ae / be stars may be detected via this technique .",
    "clearly , it is not sufficient to merely label all excess h@xmath0 emitters detected via 2-cds as `` be stars '' as is nearly universally done in the literature . given a cluster of sufficient age , and assuming coeval development",
    ", one would not expect to find any remaining pre - main - sequence stars ; hence , this type of contamination may not be an issue .",
    "however , when examining the background field be population surrounding a cluster using the 2-cd technique ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assert that one must be wary of detecting herbig ae / be stars , which would serve to artificially inflate the ratio of detected classical be stars .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , olsen ( 2003 , private communication ) , and the present study all found evidence that diffuse background contamination likely inflates the number of true classical be stars detected via the 2-cd technique .",
    "a typical form of these spurious detections we encountered were random , quasi point - source - like pockets of emission which were misconstrued as stars , especially when the _ daofind _ image roundness parameters were slightly relaxed .",
    "one also might consider how diffuse sky nebulosity affects the measurement of real sources .",
    "the iraf photometry methods we used sampled the sky background within an annulus of a given radius around sources and used the median pixel value as an estimate of the background .",
    "in extremely variable backgrounds , for example containing h ii filamentary structures , it is not always clear that this technique fully accounts for the true background present .",
    "while we do not propose a better technique to estimate background fluxes in regions of complex nebulosity , we feel it is important to remind the reader of some of the difficulties associated with observations of embedded objects when considering the results of these and similar 2-cd investigations .",
    "the addition of other independent techniques , such as ir photometry and broadband or spectropolarimetry , could provide much needed cross - checks on such identifications .",

    "clusters older than 25 myr also appear to have enhanced levels of early- and later - type candidate be stars .",
    "we suggest that the spin - up of stars as they evolve along the main sequence and/or the enhanced main sequence lifetime of rapidly rotating stars compared to slow rotators may explain this effect .",

    "these detections : a ) offer evidence that these objects do emit excess h@xmath0 emission and hence offer supporting evidence that they might be pre - main - sequence objects ; and b ) illustrate that the 2 color diagram technique will identify other types of emission - line objects , besides classical be stars .",

    "<S> we present b , v , r , and h@xmath0 photometry of 8 clusters in the small magellanic cloud , 5 in the large magellanic cloud , and 3 galactic clusters , and use 2 color diagrams ( 2-cds ) to identify candidate be star populations in these clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence that the be phenomenon is enhanced in low metallicity environments , based on the observed fractional early - type candidate be star content of clusters of age 10 - 25 myr . </S>",
    "<S> numerous candidate be stars of spectral types b0 to b5 were identified in clusters of age 5 - 8 myr , challenging the suggestion of @xcite that classical be stars should only be found in clusters at least 10 myr old . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that a significant number of b - type stars must emerge onto the zero - age - main - sequence as rapid rotators . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect an enhancement in the fractional content of early - type candidate be stars in clusters of age 10 - 25 myr , suggesting that the be phenomenon does become more prevalent with evolutionary age . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the mechanisms which might contribute to such an evolutionary effect . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of the limitations of utilizing the 2-cd technique to investigate the role evolutionary age and/or metallicity play in the development of the be phenomenon is offered , and we provide evidence that other b - type objects of very different nature , such as candidate herbig ae / be stars may contaminate the claimed detections of `` be stars '' via 2-cds . </S>"
