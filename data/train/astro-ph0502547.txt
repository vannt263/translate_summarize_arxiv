    "the paradigm of interstellar medium has undergone substantial changes recently . instead of quiescent medium with hanging and slowly evolving clouds a turbulent picture emerged ( see review by vzquez - semadeni et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "with magnetic field being dynamically important and dominating the gas pressure in molecular clouds , this calls for studies of compressible magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence .",
    "recent years have been also marked by a substantial progress in understanding of the mhd turbulence statistics ( see review by cho & lazarian 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "this statistics allows to find regularities in turbulence , e.g. power spectrum allows to learn how much energy is at a particular range of scales .",
    "a very important insight into the incompressible mhd turbulence by goldreich & shridhar ( 1995 ) ( henceforth gs95 ) has been followed by progress in understanding of compressible mhd turbulence ( lithwick & goldreich 2001 , cho & lazarian 2003 , henceforth cl03 , cho , lazarian & vishniac 2003 , vestuto et al .",
    "in particular , simulation in cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) showed that alfvnic cascade evolves on its own , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the alfvn and sound velocities respectively .",
    "however , the coupling gets marginal at smaller scales as turbulence cascades and turbulent velocities get smaller . ] and it exhibits kolmogorov type scaling ( i.e. @xmath2 ) and scale - dependent anisotropy of the goldreich - shridhar type ( i.e. @xmath3 ) even for high mach number turbulence . while slow modes exhibit similar scalings and anisotropy , fast modes show isotropy .",
    "the density scaling obtained in cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) was somewhat puzzling . at low mach numbers it was similar to slow modes , while it got isotropic for high mach numbers .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the earlier study motivate our present one .",
    "density statistics is important for understanding the structure of molecular clouds and the associated processes of star formation .",
    "are density perturbations tend to be elongated along magnetic field lines ?",
    "how does this depend on mach number of turbulence ?",
    "these are the questions that we would like to answer .",
    "there are a number of observational implications of the density spectra .",
    "shallow power spectrum can result in a lot of small scale absorption ( deshpande 2000 ) which can account for the mysterious tiny scale structures or tsas ( heiles 1997 ) .",
    "power spectrum shallower than the kolmogorov one was reported in a number of observations ( deshpande , dwarakanath & goss 2000 , padoan et al 2003 ) .",
    "can one explain this ?",
    "density anisotropies have been observed in scintillation studies at small scales but it is unclear whether we should expect them at all scales .",
    "subsonic compressible mhd is rather well studied topic today .",
    "it is suggestive that there may be an analogy between the subsonic mhd turbulence and its incompressible counterpart , namely , gs95 model .",
    "therefore the correspondence between the the two revealed in cl03 is expected .",
    "it could be easily seen , that in the low - beta case density is perturbed mainly due to the slow mode ( cl03 ) .",
    "slow modes are sheared by alfvn turbulence , therefore they exhibit kolmogorov scaling and gs95 anisotropy for low mach numbers .",
    "however , for high mach numbers we expect shocks to develop .",
    "density will be perturbed mainly by those shocks . however , the relative perturbation of density is likely to be proportional to density itself .",
    "one can also approach the problem from the point of view of underlying hydrodynamic equations .",
    "it is well known that there is a multiplicative symmetry with respect to density in the ideal flow equations for an isothermal fluid ( see e.g. passot & vzquez - semadeni , 1998 ; henceforth pv98 ) .",
    "this assume that if there is some stochastic process disturbing the density it should be a multiplicative process with respect to density , rather than additive , and the distribution for density values should be lognormal , rather that normal .",
    "1d numerical simulations of high - mach hydrodynamics confirmed that the distribution is approximately lognormal , having power - law tails in case of @xmath4 ( pv98 ) .",
    "in mhd , however , the above described symmetry is broken by the magnetic tension .",
    "this could be qualitatively described as the higher density regions having lower alfvn speed , if we assume there is no significant correlation between density and magnetic field .",
    "the latter is usually the case with strongly magnetized , low beta fluid ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is interesting to test whether this causes substantial deviation of distribution from log - normal law .    in a low mach turbulence",
    "the processes leading to the perturbation of density are governed by the sound speed .",
    "self evolution of those will be slow in comparison with shearing by alfvn waves .    with a high sonic mach",
    "we expect a considerable amount of shocks arise . in a sub - alfvnic case",
    ", however , we expect oblique shocks be disrupted by alfvnic shearing , and , as most of the shocks are generated randomly by driving , almost all of them will be sheared to smaller shocks",
    ". the evolution of the weak shocks will be again governed by the sonic speed , and structures from shearing as in low mach case should arise .",
    "we also note that shearing will not affect probability density function ( pdf ) of the density , but have to affect its spectra and structure function scaling . in other words",
    ", we deal with two distinct physical processes , one of which , random multiplication or division of density in presence of shocks , affect pdf , while the other , alfvnic shearing has to affect anisotropy and scaling of the structure function of the density .    in order to test this we performed direct numerical simulations .",
    "we used data cubes from our direct 3-dimensional numerical simulations ( see cho & lazarian 2004 ) . as we are interested in high - mach turbulence , we performed simulations on a periodic @xmath6 cartesian grid with the average sonic mach numbers of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the effects of numerical diffusion are expected to be important at the scales of less than 10 grid points .",
    "we observed that , parallel to the magnetic field , velocities stay supersonic down to 8 grid units for mach 10 , and 20 grid units for mach 3 .",
    "we used the isothermal equation of state and randomly drove turbulence on the scale about 2.5 times smaller than the box size .",
    "the alfvn velocity of the mean magnetic field was roughly the same as the rms velocity , which correspond to alfvnic mach number of around unity .",
    "in fig .  1 we show the distribution for log - density for various values of mach numbers for 3d numerical simulations of mhd . in all cases , except subsonic @xmath9 was chosen so that alfvnic mach number @xmath10 is slightly less then unity .",
    "this was motivated by the idea , that in a strongly super - alfvnic fluid , given enough time , magnetic field will grow , approaching equipartition .",
    "as soon as we observe scales smaller than a driving scale , we will see mildly super - alfvnic or sub - alfvnic turbulence .",
    "we see , that the distribution shows significant deviation from a lognormal law .",
    "the rms deviation of density for a subsonic case is consistent with prediction @xmath11 for low beta ( cl03 ) , and the rms deviation of log - density for supersonic case is around unity regardless of a mach number .",
    "the distributions are notably broader for higher mach numbers , though .",
    "this is an indication that a distribution is not universal .",
    "dimension of the high - density structures was between 1 and 2 , being viewed as a flatted filaments or elongated pancakes .",
    "there were no evident preferred orientation of these structures along or perpendicular to the mean magnetic field .",
    "maximum density value in a mach 10 data cube was around @xmath12 .",
    "it is obvious that density clumps with values of 3 - 4 orders of magnitude of mean density can severely distort power spectrum .",
    "it is expected that these clumps can hide density structures created by motions at small scales .",
    "we see in fig .  2 that the power - law spectrum of density for high - mach is very shallow .",
    "randomly distributed high - density clumps will also suppress any anisotropy originating from motions at small scales .",
    "we attempted to overcome this effect and reveal an underlying density scalings by using a log - density instead of density for spectra and structure functions .",
    "we found that this way to suppress the influence of the high peaks to the spectrum or structure function is superior to other filtering procedures .",
    "indeed , if we cut off peaks at some level , it give similar results , but structure function looks worse , as the procedure of cutting off , or restricting density to some level , introduces artificial structures in the real space .",
    "the results and the comparison with the scalings of the magnetic field is presented in fig .",
    "3 . magnetic field , being perturbed mostly by the alfvn mode , shows gs95 anisotropy .",
    "scaling of log - density is analogous to it .",
    "we also see , that such a behavior is seen right after the driving scale ( which is around 100 grid units ) by the magnetic field , but somewhat into smaller scales by the log - density .    in fig .",
    "4 we checked for the scale - dependent anisotropy of the gs95 type ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we also checked for correlation between density and magnetic field magnitude which was expected from a models of external compression of an ideal mhd fluid , and in fact observed in many super - alfvnic simulations ( see , e.g. , padoan & nordlund 1999 ) .",
    "we have not found any significant correlation of this type .",
    "it is a well known notion that a supersonic turbulence consists mostly of shocks and other discontinuities .",
    "our driving is incompressible , but the modes are not decoupled at the injection scale when alfvnic mach number is of the order of unity ( cl03 ) .",
    "therefore we expect that the driving excites an appreciable amount of compressible motions .",
    "indeed , our testing of data showed that the rms velocity , associated with slow mode was of the same order as the velocity of the alfvn mode .",
    "we assume that the resulting flat power spectrum of density is associated with very large perturbation of density from compressible motions that naturally arise at the driving scale due to coupling of compressible and incompressible motions quantified in cl03 .",
    "shocks in isothermal fluid can have very large density contrasts , up to sonic mach squared and can act as shocks in the snowplow phase of supernova , namely , they collect matter keeping the total momentum of the shock constant ( see , e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "however , we do not see strong shocks near density clumps . in magnetically dominated medium that we deal with it is reasonable to assume that the corresponding shocks move material along magnetic field lines the same way that the slow modes do in subsonic case .",
    "the shocks are randomly oriented and therefore the clumpy structure that we observe does not reveal any noticeable anisotropy .",
    "density perturbations associated with such shocks should not be correlated with the magnetic field strength enhancement similar as in the case of densities induced by slow modes ( see cl03 ) .",
    "our analysis of the data confirms this .",
    "if we associate the clumps in simulations with interstellar clouds , in ism with random driving we would expect the clouds not to be particularly oriented in relation to magnetic fields at least until self - gravity does get important .",
    "we observed substantial variation of the gas pressure , of three orders of magnitude which is consistent with findings in jenkins 2002 .",
    "flat spectrum observed is roughly consistent with some observational data .",
    "needless to say , that a more systematic analysis of data is required now when we have theoretical expectations to test , e.g. the change of the density spectrum with the mach number .",
    "testing the anisotropy of density is another interesting project , even though one can not directly observe log - density and the effects associated with the projection along the line of sight must be considered carefully ( see discussion of this in esquivel et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "surely , for real clouds self - gravity can be important .",
    "this effect should make the observed spectrum even flatter , as the density peaks will become higher and more delta - function - like .",
    "in addition , cooling may make interstellar gas more pliable to compression than the isothermal gas that we used in the simulations .",
    "this , could result in more density contrast when the original gas is warm .",
    "however , usually interstellar warm gas has mach number of the order of unity . for molecular clouds",
    "for which mach number can be substantial our isothermal calculations seems to be adequate .",
    "the alternative to this paper hypothesis explaining flat spectrum and isotopy , namely that high - mach large scale driving could affect turbulence to the scales where effective mach number is much less then unity is rather counter - intuitive and contradicts the notion of the turbulence locality in @xmath14 space .",
    "we understood that this unusual behavior is due to the fact , that density in high mach simulations is perturbed significantly nonlinearly , therefore making the interpretation of the power spectra more involved .",
    "we used filtering to mitigate this effect , and succeeded in showing that density scaling is anisotropic .",
    "the range of scales where incompressible turbulent theory is applicable is shortened in numerical simulation with supersonic driving . between sub- and supersonic scales",
    "there is a region where compressible motions cascade in a way that is yet to be understood .",
    "there exist a different effect that can make density spectrum flat at small scales .",
    "incompressible fluid with viscosity much larger than magnetic diffusivity , i.e. in high prandtl number fluid , at the viscosity - dominated scales , shows a peculiar regime cascade reported in cho , lazarian & vishniac ( 2002 ) .",
    "if the the magnetic pressure associated with anisotropic magnetic filaments formed in this new regime of mhd turbulence is balanced by the thermal pressure , it will create density structures with shallow @xmath15 spectrum",
    ". however , this effect is present only at small scales where viscosity by neutrals gets important .",
    "this allows to distinguish the two different causes of spectrum flattening .",
    "most incompressible turbulence theories assume constant density , everywhere .",
    "as we see , the supersonic driving provide transient , high contrast density structures , as the back - reaction of the fluid is the term @xmath16 which allow for very high density perturbations",
    ". this should not be a problem for theories of strong turbulence where wavepackets are cascaded in a time comparable with inverse frequency .",
    "weak turbulent theories , which have a cascading time @xmath17 dependent on energy flow in k - space seem to be less applicable , as the alfvn perturbation has to travel @xmath18 distance to fully distorted . on the other hand , @xmath19 for three - wave processes ( zakharov , lvov & falkovich , 1992 ) , where @xmath20 is the flux of energy in @xmath14 space .",
    "this distance might be pretty long , depending on @xmath20 and exceed the lengthscale at which density changes significantly .",
    "therefore , `` normal '' weak turbulence will be pushed on scales much smaller than subsonic scale . on the other hand , we do nt expect weak turbulence to be valid on smaller scales due to the increase of @xmath21 with smaller scales and the onset of strong alfvnic turbulence .",
