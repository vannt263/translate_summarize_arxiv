    "late time properties of unstable states arouse interest since the theoretical predictions of deviations from the exponential form of the decay law at suitably long times .",
    "the problem was that the predicted effect is almost negligible smal and therefore very difficult to its confirmations in laboratory experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "numbers of created unstable particles during some astrophysical processes are so large that some of them can survive up to times @xmath2 at which the survival probability depending on @xmath2 transforms from the exponential form into the inverse power  like form .",
    "it appears that at this time region a new quantum effect is observed : a very rapid fluctuations of the instantaneous energy of unstable particles take place .",
    "these fluctuations of the instantaneous energy should manifest itself as fluctuations of the velocity of the particle . based on results presented in @xcite",
    "we show in this report that this effect may cause unstable particles to emit electromagnetic radiation of a very wide spectrum : from radio frequencies through @xmath0rays to @xmath1rays of very high energies and that the astrophysical processes are the place where this effect should be observed .",

    "the decay law , @xmath5 of an unstable state @xmath6 decaying in vacuum is defined as follows @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability amplitude of finding the system at the time @xmath2 in the initial state @xmath6 prepared at time @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the solution of the schrdinger equation for the initial condition @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the total self  adjoint hamiltonian for the system considered .    from basic principles of quantum theory",

    "this effect was confirmed in experiment described in the rothe paper @xcite , where the experimental evidence of deviations from the exponential decay law at long times was reported . in the light of this",
    "result the following problem seems to be worth considering : if ( and how ) deviations from the exponential decay law at long times affect the energy of the unstable state and its decay rate at this time region .",

    "it is known that the characteristic feature of survival probabilities @xmath5 is the presence of sharp and frequent fluctuations at the transition times region , when contributions from @xmath35 and @xmath36 into @xmath5 are comparable and that the amplitude @xmath34 and thus the probability @xmath5 exhibits inverse power  law behavior at the late time region for times @xmath2 much later than the crossover time @xmath37 .",

    "the basic physical factor forcing the amplitude @xmath8 to exhibit inverse power law behavior at @xmath66 is the boundedness from below of @xmath67 .",

    "this contribution into the instantaneous energy is practically constant in time at canonical decay times whereas at the transition times , when @xmath87 , it is fluctuating function of time and the amplitude of these fluctuations may be significant .    from astronomical observations",

    "( for simplicity we assume that there is a frame of reference common for the source and observer both and that they do not move with respect to this frame of reference ) .",
