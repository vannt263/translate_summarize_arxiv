    ", the different integrands are weighed by @xmath266 . for small systems , in particular for a three level system , these correlations are significant and put bounds on maximum achievable efficiency as implied by our optimization results .",
    "we have investigated the thermoelectric efficiency of broken time reversal symmetry systems under three terminal transport . in these systems ,",
    "the efficiency is determined by two parameters , the asymmetry parameter @xmath11 and the `` figure of merit '' @xmath12 .",

    "we note that our results could be of experimental relevance in view of the recent progress in the phase - coherent manipulation of heat in solid - state nanocircuits , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "we have also studied the thermoelectric efficiency of a generic model using random hamiltonians drawn from gue .",
    "our analysis shows that it is highly improbable to obtain large values of both asymmetry in thermopower and efficiency .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the efficiency can be improved using an energy dependent transmission .",
    "in particular , optimizing the transmission matrix elements at three energy windows we have found more than one order of magnitude increase in the efficiency at large asymmetry over the three level aharonov - bohm interferometer model .",
    "the optimal values of transmission probabilities at each energy window are either @xmath267 or @xmath9 .",

    "our extensive and accurate numerical results suggest that a three terminal thermoelectric transport is viable only for large asymmetry with very low efficiency . on the other hand , using a model with random values of onsager coefficients",
    "one may obtain carnot efficiency for maximum efficiency @xmath13 and efficiency at maximum power @xmath70 for arbitrary large values of asymmetry .",
