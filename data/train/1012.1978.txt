    "the ability of a ( non - uniform ) laminar flow to deform an isolated polymer has now been demonstrated for various flow configurations ( see , e.g. , the reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) . the corresponding problem for random flows",
    "was first studied by @xcite , who observed that the strain tensor of an incompressible random flow always has a direction of stretching , although such direction fluctuates in time and in space .",
    "lumley further remarked that the vorticity penalises polymer stretching , for it prevents the polymer from remaining aligned with the principal axes of the strain tensor .",
    "he then concluded that random flows can stretch polymers if the product of the lagrangian correlation time of the strain tensor and the modulus of the maximum eigenvalue of the deformation tensor exceeds a critical value proportional to  @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite confirmed these conclusions by showing evidences of a significant amount of polymer stretching in a low - reynolds - number random flow generated by viscoelastic instabilities .    in random flows , the time scale describing the stretching of line elements is the reciprocal of the maximum lyapunov exponent  @xmath12 .",
    "hence the appropriate definition of the weissenberg number is  @xmath13 . @xcite and",
    "@xcite related the deformation of a polymer in a random flow to the statistics of the stretching rate or , more precisely , to the entropy function associated with its probability density function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
