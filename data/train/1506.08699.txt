    "the most popular issue in the modern day cosmology is the current expansion of universe .",
    "it is now evident from observational and theoretical facts that our universe is in the phase of accelerated expansion @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of dark energy and dark matter is another topic of discussion @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was einstein who first gave the concept of dark energy and introduced the small positive cosmological constant .",
    "but after sometime , he remarked it as the biggest mistake in his life .",
    "however , it is now thought that the cosmological constant may be a suitable candidate for dark energy .",
    "another proposal to justify the current expansion of universe comes from modified or alternative theories of gravity .",
    "@xmath4 theory of gravity is one such example which has been recently developed .",
    "this theory is a generalized version of teleparallel gravity in which weitzenbck connection is used instead of levi - civita connection .",
    "the interesting feature of the theory is that it may explain the current acceleration without involving dark energy .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been done in this theory so far @xcite .",
    "another interesting modified theory is @xmath5 theory of gravity which involves a general function of ricci scalar in standard einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "some review articles @xcite can be helpful to understand the theory .",
    "many authors have investigated @xmath5 gravity in different contexts -@xcite .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions are most commonly studied solutions due to their closeness to the nature .",
    "multam@xmath6ki and vilja @xcite explored vacuum and perfect fluid solutions of spherically symmetric spacetime in metric version of this theory .",
    "they used the assumption of constant scalar curvature and found that the solutions corresponded to the already existing solutions in general relativity ( gr ) .",

    "similarly many interesting results have been found using spherical symmetry in @xmath5 gravity @xcite .",
    "cylindrically symmetric vacuum and non - vacuum solutions have also been explored in this theory @xcite .",

    "thus it is hoped that @xmath1 gravity may explain the resent phase of cosmic acceleration of our universe .",
    "this theory can be used to explore many issues and may provide some satisfactory results .",
    "the isotropic models are considered to be most suitable to study large scale structure of the universe .",
    "however , it is believed that the early universe may not have been exactly uniform .",

    "a bianchi type @xmath0 cosmological model , being the generalization of flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model , is one of the simplest models of the anisotropic universe .",

    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath12 is defined as @xcite @xmath14 here we assume that the dependance of matter lagrangian is merely on the metric tensor @xmath15 rather than its derivatives . in this case , we get @xmath16 the @xmath1 gravity field equations are obtained by varying the action @xmath17 in eq.([frt1 ] ) with respect to the metric tensor @xmath15 @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the covariant derivative and @xmath20 contraction of ( [ frt4 ] ) yields @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",

    "perfect fluids problems involving energy density and pressure are not any easy task to deal with .",
    "moreover , there does not exist any unique definition for matter lagrangian .",
    "thus we can assume the matter lagrangian as @xmath28 which gives @xmath29 and consequently the field equations ( [ frt4 ] ) take the form @xmath30 it is mentioned here that these field equations depend on the physical nature of matter field .",
