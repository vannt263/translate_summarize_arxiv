    "in recent years our understanding of the x - ray cooling flow phenomenon in galaxy cluster cores has been revolutionised . throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s",
    ", x - ray observations suggested that gas in the central 100  is cooling out at rates of up to several hundred solar masses per year , but the lack of evidence for a reservoir of cooled gas led to heated debate ( summarised by fabian  1994 ) over this interpretation of the x - ray data .",
    "results from _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ have since led to a sharp downward revision in x - ray cooling rates ( e.g. schmidt , allen & fabian 2001 ) and also reveal a strong deficit of line emission from gas cooling below @xmath4 ( peterson et al .",
    "the implication is that x - ray cooling is quenched , for which numerous mechanisms have been proposed , including : rapid mixing of hot and cold phases , inhomogeneously distributed metals in the intracluster medium ( fabian et al .",
    "2001,2002 ) ; active galactic nucleus ( agn ) heating by jets ( brggen & kaiser 2003 ) and sound waves ( fabian et al .",
    "2003 ) ; thermal conduction of heat from the hotter outer parts of the cluster into the cooler core ( voigt et al . 2002 ) ; a significant relativistic cosmic ray component frozen into the thermal gas ( cen 2005 ) ; the release of gravitational energy from blobs of gas which detach from the bulk flow and fall directly into the core ( fabian 2003 ) .    concurrently",
    ", significant progress has been made in identifying cool gas and dust in cluster cores .",
    "edge  ( 2001 ) detected co emission in the centres of 16 cooling flows , consistent with @xmath5  of 2  at 2040  for a standard co:2  conversion ( see also salom & combes 2003 ) .",
    "these are roughly the masses expected , given the revised cooling rates and likely ages .",
    "interferometry shows further that the co emission is localised within the central few arcsec of the cluster ( edge & frayer 2003 ; salom & combes 2004 ) .",
    "the frequent occurrence of smaller masses ( @xmath6 ) of hot 2  has also been established ( e.g. edge et al .",
    "2002 ; jaffe , bremer & van der werf  2001 ) , and excitation analysis suggests that this hot 2  is a high pressure , transiently - heated component ( wilman et al .",
    "2002 ) . both co and 2  emissions correlate well with the strength of the h@xmath0 emission from ionized gas at @xmath7 , whose prevalence in these environments , often in the form of spectacular filaments , has long been known ( e.g. hu et al .  1983 ;",
    "crawford et al .  1999 ) .",
    "despite the clear association between optical line emission and short central x - ray cooling times ( peres et al .",
    "1998 ; bauer et al .  2005 ) , their physical relationship is ill - understood .",
    "photoionisation by the observed excess population of hot massive stars can energetically account for the h@xmath0 luminosities in the most luminous systems ( allen  1995 ; crawford et al .",

    "the picture is less clear : the tapping of energy from the intracluster medium ( icm ) through turbulence ( crawford & fabian  1992 ) and heat ( sparks et al .",
    "2004 ) are just two mechanisms which have been invoked to explain the optical nebulosity in such systems .    in this paper",
    "we present integral field spectroscopy of the ionized gas in the cores of four such clusters , a1664 , a1835 , a2204 and zw8193 .",
    "the principal aim is to obtain a full two dimensional view of the distribution and kinematics of the gas through high resolution spectroscopy of the h@xmath0+[nii ] emission line , with additional ionization information being gleaned from the [ sii]@xmath96717,6731 and [ oi]@xmath96300,6363 lines where possible .",
    "these four central cluster galaxies ( ccgs ) all have h@xmath0 luminosities exceeding @xmath10 , making them 4 of the top 6 most - h@xmath0 luminous systems in the extensive ccg spectroscopic survey by crawford et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in this regime of h@xmath0 luminosity , photoionisation by a young stellar population can account energetically for the luminosity of the h@xmath0 nebulosity ( allen  1995 ; crawford et al .",
    "in addition to an analysis of the ccgs , we also present spectroscopy of other sources within the ifu field of view , including other cluster galaxies and ( in the case of a2204 ) a serendipitous gravitationally - lensed background galaxy .",
    "we first present results for the clusters individually and then summarise and interpret their generic features . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 and all physical quantities quoted from other papers have been converted accordingly .",
    "the observations of a1664 , a1835 and a2204 were taken in service mode on 2003 april 11 with the integral field unit ( ifu ) of the visible multiobject spectrograph ( vimos ) on ut3 of the 8.2 m very large telescope ( vlt ) at eso paranal in chile ( for further information on vimos see lefevre et al .",
    "they were among the first taken with the vimos ifu in open time .",
    "the ifu was operated in hr - red mode , offering a @xmath14  field of view covered by 1600 optical fibres of 0.67  diameter .",
    "the fibres are coupled to a microlenses to ensure near - continuous sky coverage .",
    "the field of view in this ifu mode is split into 4 quadrants of 400 fibres , three of which disperse the light with the hr - red grism over 62508700 , while the fourth quadrant employs the hr - orange grism spanning 55007450 .",
    "the dispersion and spectral resolution are approximately 0.6  per pixel and 1.8  fwhm , respectively . for each of the three targets a pair of 1670s exposures",
    "was taken , with a pointing dither of @xmath15 between them .",
    "the seeing was in the range 0.51  throughout .",
    "table 1 provides an observation log .",
    "the data were reduced on site at the national institute for astrophysics ( inaf ) in milan using the vimos interactive pipeline and graphical interface ( vipgi ) ( scodeggio et al .",
    "2005 ) developed by the virmos consortium .",
    "the raw two - dimensional frames for each quadrant were bias - subtracted , and the spectra for the individual fibres were traced , extracted and flat - fielded .",
    "the pipeline wavelength calibration was affected by instrumental flexure in the time interval between science and calibration observations .",
    "the wavelength calibration was thus performed manually in iraf using night - sky emission features , rebinning to a common dispersion of 0.6  per pixel . using the mapping from detector to aperture fibre position ,",
    "the four quadrants were united into a single @xmath16 fibre data cube for each pointing , covering the wavelength range 55008740  ( i.e. large enough to accommodate the wavelength range of the hr - red and hr - orange grisms ) .",
    "the raw data format is such that the centres of adjacent fibres are separated by 5 pixels on the detector whilst the light from each fibre covers 3 pixels fwhm .",
    "there is thus a small amount of fibre - to - fibre light leakage implying that the spectra of individual fibres will not be completely independent .",
    "however , since the seeing is comparable to the fibre size and we are chiefly concerned with diffuse extended emission , the effect is not considered important and no corrections for it were made .",
    "subtraction of the night - sky emission background was performed by fitting gaussian profiles to a triplet of sky features at 7316 , 7329 and 7341  in each fibre .",
    "this intensity information was used to correct for fibre - to - fibre transmission variations across the field of view , and then to create a night - sky emission spectrum from a source - free region which was then subtracted across the whole cube . due to the use of different grisms ,",
    "sky subtraction was performed separately for quadrants 13 and 4 , respectively . for a1664 and a2204 the two dithered sky - subtracted datacubes for each target",
    "were then combined into a single datacube @xmath17 fibres in size ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "for a1835 , only the second of the two pointings contains significant line emission , since the target was inadvertently placed too near the edge of the field of view .",
    "flux calibration of the spectra was not performed , but comparison with published emission line slit fluxes ( crawford et al .",
    "1999 ) suggets that h@xmath0 emission is detected down to minimum surface brightness levels in the range 0.51.0 @xmath19 .",
    "following the reduction of the raw data , all subsequent cube manipulation and emission line analysis were performed within idl .",
    "observations of the redshifted h@xmath0 emisson in zw8193 were made with the oasis ifu on the william herschel telescope ( wht ) on la palma on 2005 september 2 in 0.8  seeing and photometric conditions .",
    "we used the mr807 filter which covers a wavelength range of 7690 - 8460  at a spectral resolution of @xmath20/@xmath21=2020 ( 2.2  per pixel ) .",
    "the 7.4@xmath2210.3  field of view was sampled contigiously with 0.26  fibres .",

    "the oasis data were reduced using the xoasis data - reduction package ( rousset 1992 ) developed at cral ( lyon ) .",
    "the reduction steps include bias and dark subtraction , extraction of the spectra using an instrument model , wavelength calibration , cosmic - ray rejection , low frequency flatfielding and sky - subtraction .",
    "the individual data - cubes were then mosaiced ( taking into account the small spatial offsets between exposures ) and resampled onto a common grid of 0.26  @xmath220.26  to create the final datacube .",

    "a simple chi - squared fitting criterion was used to decide whether one , two or zero velocity components were fitted at each position .",

    "[ fig : a1664flux ] , we see that the h@xmath0 emission has a linear filamentary structure spanning approximately 13 arcsec ( 31 kpc ) and passing through the nucleus of the central cluster galaxy along a north - east  south - west axis .",
    "two velocity components are detected along its whole length : the red component peaks on the nucleus of the ccg , but the blue component exhibits two maxima ( labelled b1 and b2 ) located approximately 1.5 arcsec from the nucleus , along an axis perpendicular to the general direction of the filament .",
    "this filament and nuclear bipolar structure are discussed further below .",
    "the presence of two velocity components along the length of the filament ( most clearly at its ne end where complications from the nuclear emission of the ccg are minimal ) suggests that it might be due to a disturbed secondary emission component superimposed on a quiescent background , or a stream of gas wrapped around the ccg , or possibly related to some form of outflow .",
    "it is plausibly related to the galaxy ( obj # 1 ) situated just beyond the sw extremity of the filament in fig .",
    "[ fig : a1664flux ] , which is confirmed to be at the cluster redshift ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : a1664vel ] .",
    "this gas may have been stripped from or disturbed by obj # 1 .",
    "indeed , the velocity of the blue emission component at position b2 ( @xmath32 ) is similar to that of obj # 1 ( @xmath31 )",
    ".    the bipolar structure may instead be an outflow from the ccg driven by starburst activity .",
    "the line of sight velocity difference between the blue emission components at b1 and b2 is @xmath33 .",
    "this suggests a minimum deprojected outflow velocity of 175 , but the symmetrical location of b1 and b2 about the nucleus suggests that the outflow may be principally directed into the plane of the sky with a much higher velocity . in the latter case",
    ", the observed radial extent of the outflow ( 1.5=3.5 ) can be used to constrain its age .",
    "assuming a deprojected outflow speed of 600  as for the h@xmath0  filaments in m82 ( shopbell & bland - hawthorn  1998 ) , the implied age is @xmath34  myr . by contrast , the orbital timescale of galaxy # 1 responsible for the creation of the filament is @xmath35  myr  ( assuming a circular orbit of radius 15  traversed at 500 ) .",
    "considering the mis - match in these timescales , it is too coincidental that an outflow from a nuclear starburst triggered by the passage of galaxy # 1  should be observed to have a similar extent to the overall stream of gas .",
    "we thus favour an interpretation in which the complex h@xmath0 structure is due to a disturbance induced by , or the stripping of gas from , galaxy # 1 .",
    "to shed further light on the origin of the complex h@xmath0 distribution , we retrieved archival vlt - fors1 imaging of a1664 .",

    "the intrinsic extinction inferred from the balmer decrement is in the range 0.460.63 mag ( crawford et al .",
    "1999 ; allen  1995 ) .",
    "corrected for this extinction , the same authors show that approximately 90 per cent of the ( rest - frame ) 4500  continuum is due to o5 and b5 stars giving rise to the 23  starburst .",
    "the gradient of increasing dust extinction from sout - west to north - east could be due to the gradient in time elapsed since the passage of galaxy # 1 , which may have triggered star formation and dust production .",
    "u or b - band imaging would more clearly show the distribution of recent star formation .",

    "<S> we present optical integral field spectroscopy of the h@xmath0-luminous ( @xmath1 ) central cluster galaxies in the cores of the cooling flow clusters a1664 , a1835 , a2204 and zw8193 . from the [ nii]+h@xmath0 complex in these moderate resolution ( 70150 ) spectra we derive two - dimensional views of the distribution and kinematics of the emission line gas , and further diagnostics from the [ sii ] and [ oi ] lines </S>",
    "<S> .    the h@xmath0 emission shows a variety of disturbed morphologies , ranging from smooth but distorted to clumpy and filamentary , with velocity gradients and splittings of several hundred  on spatial scales of 20  or more . despite the small sample size </S>",
    "<S> , there are some generic features . </S>",
    "<S> the most disturbed h@xmath0 emission appears to be associated with secondary galaxies within 1020  ( projected ) of the central galaxy and close in velocity to the h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the global h@xmath0 kinematics match those of the co(1 - 0 ) emission in single - dish data . </S>",
    "<S> the [ nii]/h@xmath0 , [ sii]/h@xmath0 and [ oi]/h@xmath0 ratios vary little with position , local h@xmath0 surface brightness or between clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the h@xmath0 and co emission arise in molecular clouds heated by a starburst , and that the latter has been triggered by interaction with a secondary galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> such co emission is known to trace massive ( @xmath2 ) compact ( @xmath3 ) reservoirs of cool molecular gas , and it is plausible that an infalling galaxy would disturb this gas , distorting the h@xmath0 morphology and initiating widespread star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the role of cloud - cloud collisions in the undisturbed molecular gas reservoir , and suggest that they might be an important source of excitation for the emission line gas in the cores of lower h@xmath0 luminosity clusters with less intense star formation .    # </S>",
