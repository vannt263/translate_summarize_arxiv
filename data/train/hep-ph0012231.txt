    "the value of the qed coupling at the @xmath0 boson mass , @xmath2 , is the poorest known of the three parameters necessary to define the standard electroweak model , which , for example , may be taken to be @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is obtained from [ eq : a1 ] ^-1 ( 0)^-1 = 137.03599976(50 ) using the relation [ eq : a2 ] ( s)^-1 = ( 1 - _ lep ( s ) - _ had^(5 ) ( s ) - ^top ( s ) ) ^-1 , where the leptonic contribution to the running of the @xmath14 is known to 3 loops @xcite [ eq : a3 ] _ lep ( m_z^2 ) = 314.98 10 ^ -4 .",
    "> from now on we omit the superscript ( 5 ) on @xmath15 and assume that it corresponds to five flavours .",

    "the main uncertainty in the calculation of @xmath15 comes from the lack of precise knowledge of @xmath19 in the energy region @xmath20 , see fig .  1 .",
    "in the upper half of this interval the situation has recently improved with the new ( preliminary ) bes - ii measurements @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there remains a major problem due to the discrepancy between the inclusive measurements of @xmath21 and the value of the cross section deduced from the sum of all the exclusive hadronic channels @xmath22 , see fig .  1 .",
    "[ fig : low ]    recently dispersion relation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) has been re - evaluated at @xmath17 @xcite , incorporating the new bes - ii data for @xmath19 . in section",

    "@xcite and , in particular , expose the dilemma with the input values of @xmath19 in the region @xmath23 . in section  3 , following jegerlehner @xcite , we describe an attempt to better determine @xmath24 by evaluating dispersion relation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) in the space - like region , at @xmath25 say , and then using perturbative qcd to analytically continue from @xmath26 . although this procedure is found to reduce the error associated with the data for @xmath19 , it is more than compensated by the uncertainties in the analytic continuation coming from the choice of the mass of the charm quark and the qcd scale",
    ".    however analytic continuation offers the possibility to resolve the dilemma in the data for @xmath27 in the region @xmath28 ( see section  4 ) , and to give a reasonably accurate determination of the pole mass @xmath29 of the charm quark ( see section  5 )",
    ". clearly a resolution of the dilemma will improve the direct determination of @xmath30 obtained by evaluating ( [ eq : a4 ] ) at @xmath17 .",

    "we evaluated dispersion relation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) at @xmath17 using the experimental data @xcite for @xmath19 in the intervals @xmath33 and @xmath34 , together with the @xmath35 and @xmath36 resonance contributions . in the remaining regions @xmath37 and @xmath38 we calculate @xmath19 from perturbative qcd using the two - loop expression with the @xmath29 and @xmath39 quark masses included and the massless three - loop expression @xcite calculated in the @xmath40 renormalization scheme correction , @xmath41 .",
    "we may take @xmath42 @xcite which leads to a negligible uncertainty in @xmath19 . ] .",
    "we estimate the perturbative  error on @xmath19 by allowing @xmath43 to vary within the uncertainties quoted in @xcite , by taking @xmath44 and by varying the scale of @xmath45 in the range @xmath46 .",
    ".a detailed breakdown of the individual exclusive channel contributions to @xmath47 .",
    "the dominant contribution arises from the @xmath48 , and the next most significant contributions are obtained from @xmath49 and @xmath50 , depicted in fig .  [ fig : pppp ] .",
    "the channels marked with @xmath51 have been corrected for missing modes .",
    "the channel highlighted by @xmath52 has had the @xmath53 contribution subtracted .",
    "those modes marked by @xmath54 have their contributions deduced from isospin relations .",
    "the modes described in @xmath55 are deduced from the ` partially ' inclusive measurements of @xmath56 , with modes explicitly included elsewhere subtracted .",
    "we have checked the contributions to the cross - section from each annihilation channel with the detailed decomposition given in @xcite , and find excellent agreement between the two evaluations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     again we see that the results favour the inclusive measurement of @xmath57 in the region @xmath58 .",
    "first , the inclusive data satisfy the self - consistency check @xmath59 for different @xmath60 for some value of @xmath29 , better than the exclusive data , see table  7 .",
    "second , the prediction for the pole mass @xmath61 is in better agreement with pdg expectations than our prediction @xmath62 obtained using the exclusive data .",
    "traditionally the value of the qed coupling on the @xmath0 pole has been determined by evaluating the dispersion relation , ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , for @xmath63 at @xmath64 . in section  2",
    "we presented an updated calculation of @xmath30 using the latest available data for @xmath65 hadrons)/@xmath66 .",
    "the main uncertainty is the input for @xmath19 in the region @xmath67 .",
    "the new ( preliminary ) bes - ii data @xcite have improved the knowledge of @xmath19 in the upper part of this region , so that the error on @xmath31 is about @xmath68 corresponding to about @xmath69 on @xmath70 @xcite . however",
    "this error does not take full account of the effects of the discrepancy between the inclusive measurement of @xmath19 and the sum of the exclusive channels in the energy region @xmath28 .",
    "this discrepancy in @xmath27 leads , on its own , to a difference of @xmath71 in the value of @xmath24 ; see table  2 .",
    "clearly it is important to resolve the dilemma .",
    "we confirm the general conclusion of jegerlehner @xcite that analytic continuation does not improve the accuracy of the determination @xmath31 .",
    "we find the evaluation of @xmath63 at the space - like value @xmath72 has a reduced error of @xmath73 .",
    "however the reduction in the error is more than offset by the uncertainty in the perturbative qcd analytic continuation from @xmath25 to @xmath74 , which arises from its dependence on the choice of charm mass and of the qcd scale .    on the other hand the evaluation of ( [ eq : a4 ] ) at different space - like values @xmath25 proves to be very informative . for each evaluation @xmath75 at a different , but sufficiently large , @xmath60 , we can analytically continue to @xmath74 , and then around the semicircle in the complex plane to @xmath17 , using perturbative qcd .",
    "we can compare these determinations of @xmath31 with the traditional method of directly evaluating ( [ eq : a4 ] ) at @xmath17 .",
    "in fact we found it convenient to study the difference [ eq : a17 ] d ( s_0 ) .",
    "_ had ( m_z^2 ) |_direct - . _ had ( m_z^2 ) |_anal .",
    "froms_0 as a function of @xmath60 .",
    "a self - consistent analysis requires @xmath59 for all choices of @xmath60 .",
    "indeed we found that the study of @xmath76 sheds light on the inclusive  versus exclusive  data dilemma , and provides evidence in favour of the former .",
    "but first we noted that the perturbative qcd analytic continuation was sensitive to the pole mass @xmath29 of the charm quark , as well as to the qcd scale @xmath77 . to eliminate the dependence on @xmath29 ( and @xmath39 ) we evaluated @xmath76 using the data for @xmath19 in the region @xmath33 and three - flavour perturbative qcd elsewhere .",
    "we performed the analysis using first the inclusive , and then the exclusive , data for @xmath28 ; in each case for three choices of the qcd scale .",
    "we found the inclusive  @xmath76 values were more self - consistent than the exclusive  behaviour of @xmath76 .",
    "we exploited the sensitivity of the @xmath76 analysis to the pole mass of the charm quark in order to determine the value of @xmath29 . to do this we repeated the above procedure with the charm data reinstated and used four - flavour qcd .",
    "if the inclusive  data are used , we found that indeed there is a unique value of @xmath29 for which we obtain the same @xmath24 for the different space - like @xmath25 values and for the direct evaluation at @xmath17 . in this way",
    ", we determine the pole mass to be [ eq : a18 ] m_c = 1.33 - 1.40  gev , if the qcd scale is @xmath78 or 20  gev respectively .",
    "just as in the three - flavour study , we found that the four - flavour analysis is less consistent if the exclusive  data choice is employed .    in summary",
    ", we have presented quite a body of evidence to show that self - consistency of the results for the space - like and time - like evaluation of dispersion relation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) selects the inclusive measurements of @xmath19 in the region @xmath79 , as compared to the values of @xmath19 deduced from the sum of the exclusive channels .",
    "thus we conclude that [ eq : a19 ] _",
    "had^(5 ) ( m_z^2 ) = ( 274.26 1.90 ) 10 ^ -4 , and hence that [ eq : a20 ] ^-1 ( m_z^2 ) = 128.972 0.026 .",
    "the corresponding results using the exclusive data , which are not favoured , are @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "precise measurements of @xmath19 in the energy region @xmath28 are necessary to confirm our conclusion and , more important , to improve the precision in the determination of the qed coupling on the @xmath0 pole .",
    "we thank zhengguo zhao for providing the preliminary bes - ii measurements of @xmath1 , and martin grnewald , andreas hcker , andrei kataev and thomas teubner for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the uk particle physics and astronomy research council ( pparc ) , and by the eu framework tmr programme , contract fmrx- ct98 - 0194 ( dg-12-miht ) .",
    "the final bes measurements have just become available , see ref .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1 at @xmath82 and 2.5  gev are slightly higher than the preliminary measurements @xcite .",
    "in fact the latter three points now lie on our input curve for @xmath1 that is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the point at @xmath83  gev has increased by about 5% to @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "these small changes do not affect the results presented in this paper .",
