    "recently new data from cosmo - lep program , this time from delphi detector , has been reported @xcite . among other things",
    "they have confirmed the findings reported before by aleph @xcite , namely that one observes bunches of cosmic muons ( i.e. , produced at the top of the earth s atmosphere ) of unexpected large multiplicities ( up to @xmath0 ) .",
    "their origin is so far unexplained and no model used in monte carlo ( mc ) programs simulating cascades of cosmic rays ( cr ) in the atmosphere is able to account for this phenomenon . in @xcite",
    "the expectation was made that source of this discrepancy can eventually come directly from the elementary interaction model used in mc .",
    "however , in our opinion , which we would like elaborate here in more detail , it could rather come ( at least to a large extent ) from the projectile initiating the cascade .",
    "namely , as we have already done in many places on other occassions @xcite , we shall argue that the abovementioned results of both experiments can be regarded as yet another signal of the presence in the flux of cr entering the earth s atmosphere of nuggets of strange quark matter ( sqm ) called _ strangelets_. in this way results of @xcite and @xcite would just continue a long list of other phenomena explanable in this way like anomalous cosmic ray burst from _",
    "cygnus x-3 _ , extraordinary high luminosity gamma - ray bursts from the _ supernova remnant n49 _ in the large magellanic cloud or _ centauro _ ( to mention only the most interesing and intriguing examples , for more details see @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite",
    "we have already provided successful explanation of aleph observations by using notion of strangelets and assuming their flux being the same as obtained from analysis of all previous signals of strangelets present in the literature .",
    "( actually , at that time aleph results were circulated only as conference papers , however , the final results presented in @xcite turned out to be identical to those addressed in @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth to remind here that cosmolep data are very important because : @xmath1 the high multiplicity cosmic muon events ( _ muon bundles _ ) are potentially very important source of information about the composition of primary cr because muons transport in essentially undisturbed way information on the first interaction of the cosmic ray particle with atmosphere ; @xmath2 such events have never been studied with such precise detectors as provided by lep program at cern , nor have they been studies at such depth as at cern @xcite ( ranging between @xmath3 and @xmath4 meters what corresponds to muon momentum cut - off between @xmath5 and @xmath6 gev ) .",
    "for completeness let us remind here the most important for us features of strangelets ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "they are hadron - like being a bag of up , down and strange quarks ( essentially in equal proportion ) becoming absolutely stable at high mass number @xmath7 ( more stable than the most tightly bound nucleus as iron ) .",
    "however , they become unstable below some critical mass number , @xmath8 . despite the fact that their geometrical radii are comparable to those of ordinary nuclei of the corresponding mass number @xmath7 , @xmath9 , they can still propagate very deep into atmosphere . this is because @xcite after each collision with the atmosphere nucleus strangelet of mass number @xmath10 becomes just a new    ( 8.0,8.0 )    strangelet with mass number approximately equal @xmath11 and this procedure continues unless either strangelet reaches earth or ( most probably ) disintegrates at some depth @xmath12 of atmosphere reaching @xmath13 .",
    "actually , in a first approximation ( in which @xmath14 ) , in the total penetration depth of the order of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the usual mean free path of the nucleon in the atmosphere .",
    "there are number of candidates for strangelets known in the literature , the common feature is their small ratio of charge @xmath17 and mass @xmath7 numbers , @xmath18 .",
    "the so called _ saito events _ have @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the most spectacular is _ price event _",
    "@xcite with @xmath22 but @xmath23 . on the other hand",
    "the _ exotic track event _ ( et ) @xcite has been produced after the respective projectile has traversed @xmath24 g/@xmath25 of atmoshere . finally , the so called _ centauro events _",
    "@xcite has been produced at depth @xmath26 g/@xmath25 and contains probably @xmath24 baryons @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 we show the resulting flux of strangelets obtained by considering the above signals @xcite",
    ". one can add to them the recently registered with ams detector @xcite event with small ratio @xmath18 and also very small @xmath7 , estimated to be @xmath27 , it could be a metastable strangelet .",
    "this is the picture we shall use to estimate the production of muon bundles produced as result of interaction of strangelets with atmospheric nuclei .",
    "we use for this purpose the showersim @xcite modular software system specifically modified for our present purpose .",
    "monte carlo program describes the interaction of the primary particles at the top of atmosphere and follows the resulting electromagnetic and hadronic cascades through the atmosphere down to the observation level .",
    "registered are muons with momenta exceeding @xmath6 gev for aleph and @xmath28 gev for delphi .",
    "primaries initiated showers were sampled from the usual power spectrum @xmath29 with the slope index equal to @xmath30 and with energies above @xmath31 tev .    the integral multiplicity distribution of muons from aleph data are compared with our simulations in fig .",
    "2 . for completeness",
    "delphi data are present also .",
    "at first we have used here the so called `` normal '' chemical composition of primaries with @xmath32 % of protons , @xmath33 % of helium , @xmath33 % of c - n - o mixture , @xmath34 % of ne - s mixture and @xmath34 % of fe . as one can see in fig .",
    "2 it can describe only the low multiplicity ( @xmath35 ) region of aleph data .",
    "the small admixture of strangelets with the mass number @xmath36 being just above the estimated critical one estimated @xmath37 in the primary flux of cr ( corresponding to relative flux of strangelets @xmath38 ) can , however , fully accomodate aleph data . as can be noticed delphi data @xcite differ rather substantially in shape from aleph data .",
    "they could be described equally well for @xmath39 but only with @xmath40-fold smaller flux of strangelets . however , in this case events with small @xmath41 would fall completely outside the fit .",
    "( 8.0,9.5 )    one should notice that results of both experiments differ already at small values of muon multiplicity .",
    "it looks like delphi makes preference for heavy composition of primary cr right from the beginning whereas aleph preferes somohow lighter ( protonic ) composition of cr . in any case",
    ", the excess of muons is clearly visible therefore we regard this as a possible additional signal of strangelets .",
    "to conclude : we propose to regard the cosmo - lep data on cr muons obtained so far as an additional possible signal of the possible sqm admixture present in the primary cr flux .",
    "we would like to add here that such admixture would also contribute to cr flux at energies greater than gzk cut - off @xcite explaining therefore this phenomenon in a quite natural way .",
    "this makes strangelets interesting subject to investigate in the future .",
    "we would like to close with the following remark . with the flux of strangelets as estimated by us and used here ( equal to @xmath42 in the enrgy range of tens of gev ) the energetic spectrum of strangelets should fall like @xmath43 , i.e. , with spectral index being much smaller than for protons .",
    "actually , this result agrees nicely with @xmath7-dependence of the spectral index of cr s obtaine when fitting the world cr data @xcite .",
