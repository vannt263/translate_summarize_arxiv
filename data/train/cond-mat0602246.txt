    "when the temperature is increased decoherence becomes important also for the @xmath64 case and the fano effect is almost completely lost at @xmath151 .",
    "figure[fig6](c ) shows @xmath127 for @xmath149 , @xmath152 , @xmath64 and @xmath153 .",
    "these parameters were chosen such as to resemble the data in fig.[fig6](d ) measured at @xmath151 . using the dimensions of the ring dot structure we estimate a phase coherence length @xmath154 nm at this temperature .",
    "the decoherence of paths through the dot strongly suppresses the asymmetric line shapes , leading to an ab pattern in the conductance .",
    "this clearly links the observed asymmetric line shapes to the interaction between discrete states formed in the dot and continuous states of the ring and further strengthens our explanation in terms of the fano effect .",
    "the scattering model clearly reproduces all the characteristic features of the experimental data but has a few obvious limitations .",
    "while we restrict decoherence to the dot , a more accurate model would include both thermal averaging as well as decoherence in the dot , the ring and the interconnecting arm . using",
    "thermal averaging alone we were not able to reproduce the experimental data at finite temperature and the inclusion of decoherence in the ring and the interconnecting arm did not improve the model .",
    "we therefore restricted ourselves to decoherence as discussed above and speculate that the additional leads on the dot are the main source for decoherence of the fano effect .",
    "the model only treats a two - terminal geometry which neglects effects of the two contacts on the dot in terms of the symmetry of the current as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the model also assumes that there are no net currents flowing from the dot to the ring ( @xmath155 ) . from the simultaneous measurements of @xmath1 we estimate this contribution to be about two times smaller than the dips ( peaks ) in @xmath0 for @xmath122 and",
    "we are therefore led to believe that it has little influence on @xmath0 . however , where the current through the dot is suppressed at larger magnetic fields [ e.g. , in the lower left corner in fig.[fig3](c ) ] ab - periodic features are found in @xmath14 indicating that either the coherent coupling between the two systems also influences @xmath14 or that there is a considerable ab - modulated net current flowing from the ring leads into the dot .    in a quantum dot the addition energy between two resonances is not only determined by space quantization effects but is enhanced by coulomb interactions between the electrons on the dot .",
    "this is not included in our calculation and could explain the slightly stronger modulation as a function of gate voltage in the experimental data when comparing with the model at @xmath156k in fig.[fig4](c)-(d ) . while we think that our model accurately describes the regime where the fano effect is strong , we find that in the experimental data at @xmath156k the dips in @xmath0 are closer to the actual peak positions of the dot than in the model .",
    "we have shown that the influence of cross - coupling from the dot is negligible in the completely decoupled system ( see also ref ) .",
    "however for @xmath119 - 69.9 mv the channel between the two structures is not pinched off and coulomb interactions could be stronger and possibly lead to modified fano line shapes close to the resonance condition of the dot.@xcite    we find that spin paired peaks involving subsequent filling of the same orbital do not only show similar behavior in @xmath14 but also lead to a similar interference pattern in @xmath0 as evident , e.g. , in fig.[fig4](b ) .",
    "we conclude , that spin is not important for the observed interference effect and kondo correlations@xcite are therefore negligible .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated that the current through a ring with a coherently side coupled dot leads to asymmetric line shapes in the current through the ring as a function of a gate voltage which tunes the discrete dot levels .",
    "this is indicative of the fano effect and we have shown that the symmetry of the observed fano line shapes can be tuned by applying a magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath10-parameter was adjusted with a gate voltage tuning the coupling between the ring and the dot .",
    "good agreement between the data and a single - channel scattering matrix model allows us to identify our structure with a fano scatterer embedded in a two - terminal ab - ring .",
    "comparison with this model also lets us to identify the additional leads on the dot as the dominant source of decoherence for the fano effect . raising the temperature to @xmath156k the fano effect almost completely disappears while ab - interference in the ring persists to above @xmath157k ."
