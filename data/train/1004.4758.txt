    "since we have to realize a paraunitary polyphase matrix for the filter bank , it is required that the polyphase matrices for all the channels should have same number of columns .",
    "let @xmath239,@xmath240,@xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "then the polyphase matrix for @xmath7-th channel , denoted by @xmath243 , will be of the dimensions @xmath244 and the polyphase matrix for the filter bank will be given by @xmath245        \\label{eq_filtbank_polyphase}\\ ] ]    let the modulation matrix corresponding to @xmath243 be denoted by @xmath246 .",
    "the modulation matrix @xmath246 will be characterized by @xmath247 filters .",
    "let these filters be denoted by @xmath248 . since @xmath243 is paraunitary , from ( [ eq_h_mod_2 ] ) it can be seen that @xmath246 is also paraunitary . by using the paraunitary condition on the modulation matrix @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath249 , it can be shown that the filters characterizing the modulation matrix satisfy @xmath250 where @xmath251 is some constant . from this",
    ", it can be seen that if the stopband energy of all the filters is minimized , then the passband energy would get maximized .",
    "thus we can define an objective function , based on stopband energies of filters in all the channels .",
    "this is done as follows :    1 .",
    "find out the dimensions of the polyphase matrix @xmath10 as explained above .",
    "define a paraunitary polyphase matrix @xmath252 that depends on the parameters @xmath253 .",
    "3 .   find out the ideal frequency response for all the filters @xmath254 .",
    "4 .   choose a transition bandwidth @xmath255 .",
    "using this transition bandwidth and ideal frequency response of @xmath256 , find out its stopband @xmath257 5 .",
    "define the objective function @xmath258    by minimizing @xmath259 with respect to @xmath253 we can obtain the required polyphase matrix @xmath252 .      for the design examples given below ,",
    "we will use given s factorization for the paraunitary matrices @xcite .",
    "thus if a paraunitary matrix has size @xmath260 and order @xmath261 , then the parameter vector @xmath253 will have @xmath262 parameters .    _ example 1 _ : in this example we consider the rational splitting @xmath263",
    ".    since for the third channel we have @xmath264 and @xmath265 , accordng to lemma([thm_imm ] ) the size of polyphase matrix for this channel will be @xmath266 .",
    "thus the complete filter bank can be realized by a @xmath267 polyphase matrix , with first @xmath268 rows for first channel , next @xmath269 rows for second channel and last @xmath268 rows for the last channel .    by applying lemma([thm_mod_filt ] ) and",
    "lemma([thm_idl_mod_filt ] ) it can be seen that each channel can be characterized by two filters and only one filter out of these two filter has non - zero ideal frequency spectrum .",
    "a polyphase matrix is realized using the procedure outlined above with transition bandwidth equal to @xmath270 and the number of stages in the polyphase matrix equal to @xmath271 .",
    "the ideal frequency spectrum and actual frequency spectrum of the filters are given in fig.([fig_filts_ex_1 ] ) .",
    "in these figures stopband of ideal filters is shown at @xmath272 line .        ,     _ example 2 _ : in this example we consider the rational splitting @xmath273 .",
    "the size of the polyphase matrix in this case would be @xmath274 .",
    "first channel will have only one filter , next two channels will have three filters and last channel will have only one filter . for second and third channel , two filters will have nonzero frequency spectrum .",
    "the ideal and realized filters are shown in fig.([fig_filts_ex_1 ] ) .",
    "for this realization the transition bandwidth is taken as @xmath275 and the polyphase matrix has @xmath271 stages .    ,     ,",
    "in this paper we have presented a design method to design rational filter banks using @xmath0 shift - invariant systems .",
    "we have obtained minimum dimension of a @xmath0-shift invariant system for ideal mapping .",

    "ideal frequency spectrum of these filters are obtianed obtaining and then paraunitary polyphase matrix of the filter bank is obtained by minimizing the stopband energies of these filters .",
    "since the design method is based on @xmath0-shift - invariant systems , filter banks with arbitrary rational splitting can be designed by this method .",
