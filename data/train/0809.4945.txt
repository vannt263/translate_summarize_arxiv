    "the magnetic field configuration at the galactic center ( gc ) has been investigated with a wide variety of methods .",
    "recent far - infrared ( fir ) and sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) polarimetric observations point out that the magnetic field is generally parallel to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "this is contrast to the poloidal field traced by non - thermal radio filaments , most of which align nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "previous near - infrared ( nir ) polarization measurements of the gc were discussed in terms of selective absorption by the intervening interstellar dust grains in the galactic disk . to our knowledge , no one has studied the magnetic field configuration _ at _ the gc with nir polarimetry . in this paper , we present results of nir polarimetric observations toward the gc .",
    "we demonstrate that nir polarization of point sources can provide information on the magnetic field structure at the central region of our galaxy .",
    "we observed a 20 @xmath1 20 area centered at the position of sgr a * with the nir polarimetric camera sirpol on the irsf telescope .",
    "sirpol consists of a single - beam polarimeter and nir imaging camera sirius .",
    "sirius provides images of a 77 @xmath1 77 area of sky in three nir wavebands , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 m ) , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 m ) , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 m ) simultaneously with a scale of 045 pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the stokes parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for point sources were determined from aperture polarimetry of combined images . based on intensities for each wave plate angle",
    ", we calculated the stokes parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the degree of polarization @xmath16 and the position angle @xmath17 were derived by @xmath18    we show a @xmath6-band vector map binned by @xmath19 in fig .",
    "the vectors are superposed on the three color ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 ) composite image of the same region . at a first glance ,",
    "most of the vectors are in order , and are nearly parallel to the galactic plane . moving north - eastward across the image , the position angles slightly rotate clockwise .",
    "at a few positions where the number density of stars is small , and hence strong foreground extinction exists , the vectors have irregular directions particularly at the northwestern corner .",
    "these irregularity might be explained by the inherent magnetic field configuration in foreground dark clouds .",
    "polarimetric measurements of stars of different distances reveal the three dimensional distribution of magnetic field orientations . from the stars at the close side in the galactic bulge",
    "( referred to hereafter as `` blue stars '' due to their relatively small reddening ) , we can obtain @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are affected mainly by interstellar dust grains in the galactic disk .",
    "the light from stars at the far side in the bulge ( hereafter `` red stars '' ) is transmitted through the dust in the disk _ and _ the bulge .",
    "therefore , using both blue and red stars , we can obtain the polarization originating in the bulge .",
    "the procedure is as follows .    at first",
    ", we divided the field into @xmath20 sub - fields , and made @xmath21 histograms for each sub - field . using the histograms",
    ", we evaluated a peak value of the histogram @xmath22 . for @xmath21 color",
    ", we divided the stars into two groups : `` blue '' and `` red '' stars in the bulge .",
    "the `` blue '' stars are redder than @xmath23 and bluer than @xmath24 .",
    "the stars with @xmath25 are selected as `` red '' stars .",
    "next , @xmath26 and @xmath27 histograms in the @xmath6 band were constructed for the blue and red stars in each sub - field .",
    "we calculated their means as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we then obtained @xmath16 and @xmath17 for `` red minus blue '' components using the following equations @xcite : @xmath32 @xmath33.\\ ] ] the errors of @xmath34 and @xmath35 were calculated from the standard error on the mean @xmath36 of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 histograms , where @xmath37 is the standard deviation and @xmath38 is the number of stars ( see nishiyama et al .",
    "2009 , for more detail ) .",
    "we show a vector map for @xmath39 and @xmath40 in fig .",
    "the average of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are obtained as 0.85 % and 160 , only for grids where the polarization is detected with @xmath41 .",
    "the histogram of @xmath40 has a peak at @xmath42 , which roughly coincides with the angle of the galactic plane .",
    "a similar result is also obtained for the @xmath4-band polarization .",
    "this coincidence shows the basically toroidal geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field at the gc has been investigated from polarized dust emission in the fir and sub - mm wavelengths . as seen in fig .",
    "2 , the magnetic field configuration we obtained at the gc shows a good agreement globally with those obtained by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which are the highest angular resolution polarimetry data sets in the fir / sub - mm wavelengths . the polarized fir / sub - mm emission comes from molecular clouds , which are known to be located in the gc .",
    "therefore we conclude that the position angles derived from our nir polarimetry represent the direction of the magnetic field _ in _ the gc .    from @xmath21 color differences between peaks in the @xmath21 histograms and mean colors of the blue and red stars , we tried to estimate the depth of the region where we have mapped the magnetic field configuration . using @xmath43 @xcite and the model of dust distribution by @xcite",
    ", we obtained the average distances of 0.5 kpc from the gc for the blue stars , and 1.0 kpc for the red stars .",
    "this suggests that the polarization shown in fig . 2 occurs between the average distances of @xmath44 kpc and @xmath45 kpc from the sun , arising probably from the central 1@xmath462 kpc region of our galaxy ( where @xmath47 is the distance between the gc and the sun ) .",
    "we have shown that the polarization of starlight can be a probe of the magnetic field near the gc .",
    "@xcite enumerated five different ways in which the magnetic field near the gc has been studied : morphology , polarization angle , faraday rotation of the radio continuum , zeeman effect , and polarized dust emission in fir / sub - mm wavelengths . the wide field - of - view of the nir polarimeter sirpol , and the statistical treatment of tens of thousands of stars",
    "enable us to study the magnetic field near the gc ; that is , the nir polarimetry of starlight is a new way to investigate the magnetic field _ in _ the gc .",
    "nir polarimetry has the advantage of providing information about the magnetic field at locations where fir / sub - mm emission is weak .",
    "nir polarization of starlight is attributed to extinction along the line of sight by aligned dust grains , while fir / sub - mm polarization is due to emission from the aligned dust .",
    "hence , nir polarimetry can investigate the magnetic field in regions where fir / sub - mm polarimetry is absent , if background stars exist .",
    "this advantage is clearly shown in fig .",
    "we have detected polarization at positions where thin bars are not shown .",
    "the distribution of the position angles in most of the observed regions including such low emission regions shows a globally toroidal magnetic configuration at the gc .",
