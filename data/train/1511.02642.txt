    "it is well - known that about one half of the nuclei heavier than iron are synthesized in the astrophysical slow neutron capture process ( s - process ) .",
    "the main component of the s - process  is assigned to thermally pulsing agb stars where neutrons are generated by the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  reaction at low temperatures ( @xmath10kev ) in the long interpulse phases and by the @xmath11ne(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath12 mg  reaction at higher temperatures ( @xmath13kev ) in the shorter pulses .",
    "the weak component of the s - process  occurs in more massive stars with temperatures up to about @xmath14kev @xcite .",
    "the role of levels in @xmath0o  for the s - process  is twofold .",
    "first , levels close to and above the @xmath1c-@xmath2  threshold enhance the resonant neutron production in the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  reaction .",
    "second , the number of neutrons available for capture reactions on heavy nuclei is reduced by resonances in the @xmath4o(@xmath3,@xmath5)@xmath0o  reaction which correspond to levels in @xmath0o  close above the @xmath4o-@xmath3 threshold .",
    "thus , the nucleus @xmath4o  may act as a neutron poison via the @xmath4o(@xmath3,@xmath5)@xmath0o  reaction .",
    "a detailed study of the role of @xmath4o as neutron poison for the s - process  will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the present study attempts to provide improved level properties of states in @xmath0o .",
    "although many experiments have been done over the last decades , the adopted values for excitation energies @xmath15 and total widths @xmath16 are often adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite from early neutron scattering data @xcite .",
    "these data affect the stellar reaction rates of the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  and @xmath4o(@xmath3,@xmath5)@xmath0o  reactions .",
    "in addition , the knowledge of these level properties is essential for the analysis of indirect experimental data for the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  reaction rate .",
    "the @xmath7f(@xmath8,@xmath2)@xmath0o  reaction has been chosen for the present study because practically all levels in @xmath0o  are populated with sufficient statistics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : exp ] the experimental procedure is briefly described , and the measured excitation energies @xmath15 and total widths are listed .",

    "some interesting details for other levels will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : other ] .",
    "a first try to populate states in @xmath0o  with the @xmath4o(d , p ) reaction had shown to produce too much background from the other components of the sio@xmath21 or al@xmath21o@xmath22 targets .",
    "the present work used the @xmath7f(@xmath8,@xmath2)@xmath0o  reaction to determine total widths of levels in the residual @xmath0o  nucleus .",
    "the pickup of a proton and a neutron is supposed to populate rather unspecifically all levels in the final nucleus .",
    "the experiment has been performed at the mll tandem accelerator of the munich universities where a high - resolution q3d magnetic spectrograph is available .",
    "a deuteron beam was accelerated to an energy of 22 mev and focused onto the target with an average intensity of more than 0.6 @xmath23a . as target we used @xmath24lif with a thickness of 46 @xmath23g/@xmath25 evaporated onto a 12 @xmath23g/@xmath25 carbon foil .",
    "the @xmath24li has the advantage that the ( d,@xmath2 ) reaction leads to another @xmath2-particle with no excited states .",
    "the outgoing @xmath2-particles were momentum analyzed with the q3d spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the identification and position measurement was performed with the 0.89 m long focal plane detector @xcite .",
    "it consists of a proportional counter for energy loss and position measurement and a scintillator measuring the residual energy .",
    "@xmath26 -spectra were taken with two settings : at a scattering angle of 15@xmath27 and an excitation energy range between 3750 kev and 6200 kev and a long run at 10@xmath27 and between 5500 and 7800 kev . since the position along the focal plane is not a linear function of the particle energy we have used lines in @xmath0o  for an internal calibration with a quadratic polynomial . and ,",
    "since the slope of the calibration is not constant , the channel contents were accordingly transformed as well as their uncertainties .",
    "the calibrated spectra are shown in figs .",
    "[ low ] and [ high ] .",
    "all lines were fitted using a gaussian or , for broad peaks , a lorentzian line shape .",
    "the energy resolution of 20kev ( fwhm ) is mainly caused by the difference in energy loss of the 22 mev deuterons and the 24.9 mev ( for @xmath28 = 6.36mev ) @xmath2-particles .",
    "to fit the broad resonance at 6.36 mev we used a large range of the spectrum from about 5.5 mev to 7.5 mev , excluding narrow peaks but including the broad peak at 7.20 mev which extends down to the high energy tail of the 6.36 mev line . for the background a cubic polynomial was used . besides fitting with a constant width , the width of the 6.36  mev line was also taken proportional to the velocity of the neutron , to be emitted , via the energy above the neutron - threshold at e@xmath29  =  4.143  mev as @xmath30 , \\label{eq : gam}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 the width at the resonance energy @xmath32 . that improved the @xmath33 by about 1% , reduced the resonance energy by 0.8 kev , but did not affect the width .",
    "the best fit has a @xmath33/dof  =  1344/1228 .",
    "the resonance curve in fact is a voigt - profile which is the convolution of a gaussian and a lorentzian and does not have an analytical solution .",
    "therefore we have used the parametrization of olivero and longbothum @xcite @xmath34 to extract the lorentzian width @xmath35 from the voigt width @xmath36 ( fitted ) and the experimental gaussian width @xmath37  kev ( fwhm ) .",
    "the results for the 6.36 mev resonance as well as for all other states in @xmath0o between 3.8 mev and 7.8 mev are given in table [ tab : res ] . to accommodate the uncertainty of the intrinsic energy calibration an uncertainty of 0.3  kev has been added in quadrature to the uncertainties of the fitted excitation energies .",

    "we first focus on the neutron production in the s - process .",
    "the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  reaction operates at very low temperatures of @xmath39kev ; the gamow window for this temperature is located at @xmath40kev ; with the @xmath2  separation energy @xmath41kev @xcite this corresponds to an excitation energy of @xmath42kev .",
    "( note that all energies @xmath43 are given in the center - of - mass system except explicitly noted ; excitation energies in @xmath0o  are denoted by @xmath15 . )",
    "a detailed r - matrix study has taken into account 84 levels in @xmath0o  from @xmath44 to @xmath45mev to derive the astrophysical s - factor  @xmath46 and the reaction rate @xmath47 of the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  reaction @xcite .",
    "however , the careful inspection of the level scheme of @xmath0o  shows that the astrophysical s - factor  in the gamow window is strongly affected by the properties of one particular broad @xmath9 state close to the @xmath2  threshold .",
    "the adopted parameters of this @xmath9 state have been derived mainly from neutron scattering : @xmath48kev , @xmath49kev , @xmath50kev @xcite .",
    "this level will be called `` threshold level '' ( tl ) in the following .",
    "the tl leads to a resonant ( breit - wigner ) contribution to the cross section @xmath51 with the wave number @xmath52 and the energy - dependent widths @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the @xmath2 and the neutron channel .",
    "the total width is practically identical to the neutron width : @xmath55 .",
    "the spin factor @xmath56 for this @xmath9 state has been omitted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) . obviously , the cross section scales linearly with @xmath57 . in the gamow window",
    "we have @xmath58 , and thus the cross section is also roughly proportional to @xmath59 .    because an adopted neutron width @xmath54 is available @xcite , most recent work",
    "has focused on @xmath2-transfer experiments and the indirect determination of @xmath57 of the tl using spectroscopic factors , reduced widths , or asymptotic normalization coefficients @xcite .",
    "these studies have been complemented by a trojan horse experiment @xcite .",
    "a direct determination of @xmath53 is impossible for a subthreshold state and practically not possible for a state very close above the threshold .",
    "direct experimental data for the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  reaction reach energies down to about 270kev @xcite .",
    "further experimental data can be found in refs .",

    "the present experiment improves the excitation energy @xmath15 and the total width @xmath16 of the tl . besides the direct impact on the cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) and the resulting reaction rate , improved @xmath15 and @xmath16 may also affect the analysis of the transfer experiments @xcite .",
    "in all these studies the adopted values for @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the tl @xcite had to be used to fit small and broad peaks in spectra with significant background .",
    "contrary to the transfer experiments @xcite , the recent trojan horse experiment @xcite has attempted to derive @xmath16 and @xmath53 simultaneously ; but also the trojan horse experiment had to use the adopted excitation energy @xmath15 .",
    "huge discrepancies of about a factor of 30 for @xmath53 and the contribution of the tl to the @xmath1c(@xmath2,@xmath3)@xmath4o  reaction rate have been derived from the transfer data and the trojan horse experiment @xcite .",
    "this may at least partly be attributed to the use of the adopted values @xmath15 and @xmath16 which are revised in the present study .",
    "following the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has to be noted for completeness that the very low result of @xcite should be excluded .",
    "unfortunately , recent studies provide also discrepant results for the total width @xmath16 in contradiction to the adopted values .",
    "the r - matrix fit by heil _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite quotes @xmath60kev and @xmath61kev , i.e.  both values are larger and show an about 3@xmath62 deviation from the adopted values .",
    "contrary to the large values in the r - matrix study @xcite , the recent trojan horse experiment claims a smaller width of @xmath63kev @xcite .",
    "a first analysis of these data has found an even smaller value of @xmath64kev @xcite .",
    "the present results for this tl are @xmath65kev and @xmath66kev .",
    "the new excitation energy @xmath15 is 7.4kev higher than the adopted value .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath15 has been reduced by more than a factor of two .",
    "the new result for @xmath15 remains within @xmath67 of the adopted value .",
    "the higher excitation energy changes this level from a subthreshold level to a resonance at @xmath68kev .",
    "the new width of @xmath69kev is 12kev higher than the adopted width , and it is close to the average value of the high r - matrix result @xcite and the low trojan - horse result @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the width has been improved significantly .    at first view",
    "it seems to be a simple task to estimate the impact of the present new results on the @xmath1c(@xmath2,n)@xmath4o cross section and reaction rate using eq .",
    "( [ eq : bw ] ) .",
    "the following estimates are given for a typical s - process  temperature of @xmath39kev which corresponds to a most effective energy @xmath40kev .",
    "keeping @xmath53 , the cross section is enhanced by about 7% from the increased new energy @xmath15 of the tl , and the larger new total width @xmath16 leads to an increase of the cross section by about 8% . combining both new values for @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 increases the cross section by 15% .",
    "however , this direct impact of the new values has to be complemented by an indirect impact which is difficult to quantify .",
    "as pointed out above , the experimental determination of @xmath57 of the tl by indirect methods often requires a peak fitting for the tl . in most cases these fits had to use the adopted values for @xmath15 and @xmath16 because the corresponding peaks were very broad ( and sometimes located on non - negligible background ) .",
    "thus , the present new results for @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the tl should be used in a re - analysis of the previous transfer and trojan horse experiments to reduce the uncertainties of the peak fitting procedures .",
    "this should lead to improved results for @xmath53 and the derived stellar reaction rate @xmath70@xmath71 ; however , such a study must remain beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "at low energies the cross section of the @xmath4o(@xmath3,@xmath5)@xmath0o  capture reaction is dominated by direct ( non - resonant ) @xmath72-wave capture to the @xmath73 ground state and @xmath9 first excited state of @xmath0o .",
    "the lowest resonances are found at 410.7kev ( @xmath17 ) and 941.7kev ( @xmath19 ) . with @xmath74kev @xcite ,",
    "these energies correspond to @xmath75 and 5085kev .",
    "the first resonance has an adopted width of @xmath76kev . because of its spin @xmath77 ,",
    "it does interfere with the direct capture amplitude , and thus it affects the capture cross section down to about 250kev @xcite .",
    "the second resonance with @xmath78 can not interfere with the direct @xmath72-wave capture .",
    "although the adopted width of this second resonance is large ( @xmath79kev ) , it has only very minor influence on the stellar reaction rate of the @xmath4o(@xmath3,@xmath5)@xmath0o  reaction .",
    "the present study provides total widths for the @xmath17 and @xmath19 states which are close to the adopted values .",
    "we find @xmath80kev for the @xmath17 state and @xmath81kev for the @xmath19 state .",
    "consequently , the adopted reaction rate of the @xmath4o(n,@xmath5)@xmath0o reaction @xcite does not change significantly from the slightly revised widths of this study .",
    "for 12 levels in @xmath0o the experimental width in the present study is given by the resolution of the experiment .",
    "the lowest state of the present study ( @xmath82 , 3843kev ) is located below particle thresholds , and thus a small width is obvious . for five states upper limits below 1kev have been adopted ; the present work confirms that these levels are narrow . for five further states small widths between 0.64kev and 6.6kev have been adopted .",
    "again the present study confirms these adopted values .",
    "no width is available in @xcite for the @xmath83 state at @xmath84kev .",
    "the present work is able to give an upper limit of about 4kev for the width , and we determine a slightly higher value of @xmath85kev for the excitation energy .",
    "there are four further states in @xmath0o with relatively broad widths which could be determined in this work . for three of these levels",
    "our new results for the widths are within @xmath67 of the adopted values @xcite . for the relatively narrow ( @xmath86kev ) @xmath87 level at 7689kev we find a slightly smaller width of @xmath88kev .",
    "however , as the width of this level is smaller than our experimental resolution , the width from this work has larger uncertainties than the adopted value . for the broad @xmath19 level around @xmath89mev we find a slightly higher @xmath90kev and a slightly smaller width @xmath91kev with a significantly reduced uncertainty compared to the adopted @xmath92kev .",
    "the excitation energy of the @xmath93 state is reduced from @xmath94kev to @xmath95kev , and the adopted width of @xmath96kev is confirmed by the present result of @xmath97kev .",
    "a surprising difference appears for the @xmath17 state with adopted @xmath98kev and @xmath99kev .",
    "here we find a higher excitation energy @xmath100kev and a larger width @xmath101kev .",
    "we do not have an explanation for the difference of the excitation energy @xmath15 between the present work and the adopted value which is based on the @xmath4o(d , p)@xmath0o experiment by piskor and schferlingova @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the adopted width of @xmath99kev is based on an early @xmath4o(d , p)@xmath0o experiment by browne @xcite , whereas an early neutron scattering experiment by striebel _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reports a much higher value of @xmath102kev ( without given uncertainty ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that an early experiment by holt _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath0o(@xmath5,n ) reaction and deduced from the r - matrix analysis values for the width of five states in @xmath0o which coincide with our values within our error bars , if inflated by 30@xmath103 .",
    "they unfortunately did not quote uncertainties .",
    "for the 6.36 mev state they had a width of 130kev .",
    "the present work has used the @xmath7f(d,@xmath2)@xmath0o reaction to study excitation energies @xmath15 and total widths @xmath16 of levels in the @xmath0o nucleus at excitaton energies between about 4 and 8mev .",
    "several obtained widths have significantly smaller uncertainties than the adopted values @xcite .",
    "the overall agreement with the adopted values @xcite is good and remains typically within @xmath104 of the adopted values .",
    "the focus of the present study is the neutron production and absorption in the astrophysical s - process .",
    "it is found that the role of @xmath4o as a neutron poison is not affected because the adopted widths of the first resonances in the @xmath4o(n,@xmath5)@xmath0o reaction are essentially confirmed in this work .",
    "the neutron production in the @xmath1c(@xmath2,n)@xmath4o reaction depends on the properties of the @xmath9 threshold level .",
    "contrary to the adopted value of the excitation energy @xmath15 , our new results show that this threshold level is located a few kev above the @xmath1c-@xmath2  threshold , and we find a larger total width than adopted in @xcite with a significantly reduced uncertainty .",
