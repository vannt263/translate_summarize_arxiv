    "classical @xmath2  cep variable stars are young massive stars of population i in their post main sequence evolution . due to their period - luminosity relation ( @xcite and @xcite ) , they are the anchor of the extragalactic distance scale . as such , they are a central topic of many investigations in nearby galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite , for a historical summary including the early hst projects , more recent work is discussed e.g. by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath2  cep stars can provide distance estimates out to several 10 mpc ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the major uncertainty of these distance values is still related to the local calibration which until recently totally rested on the lmc distance . as there is an ongoing and unsolved debate to which extent the period - luminosity relation ( plr ) of @xmath2",
    "cep stars depends on stellar properties like e.g. the metallicity @xcite , the lmc is not an optimal choice given its significantly reduced metallicity compared to the large spirals to which the plr is normally applied .",
    "@xcite summarize the recent discussion with the conclusion that the period wesenheit ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) relation ( from colors @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) does not depend on metallicity while @xcite , based on a large sample of @xmath2  cepheid stars observed with hst in two fields of the spiral galaxy m  101 , conclude the opposite and in addition report supporting evidence from other studies @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    "there have been predictions that the wesenheit plr should depend on metallicity if based on photometric bands sensitive to metal line blanketing ( like the combination of johnson @xmath5 and @xmath3 ) while the red band combinations of the johnson - cousins system should not show this dependence .",
    "the discussion of the plr properties - in individual photometric bands - has become even more complicated as some authors reported a non - universal slope for the plr ( see @xcite and references therein ) , which has not been confirmed by others and still is under debate .",
    "the recent discussion on the calibration of the cosmological distance scale and the subsequent determination of the hubble constant has somehow shadowed that these relatively young and massive stars can be also used as excellent tracers of the recent evolution of stellar populations as they allow number counts in precisely known time bins .",
    "the lmc has been the historical place for the establishment of the plr @xcite as it is close by and can be well resolved from the ground while already distant enough that the member stars are essentially at the same distance .",
    "thus , the lmc ( and smc ) were intensively studied for variable stars and transient phenomena by various projects yielding also extensive and well observed samples of cepheid stars in fundamental , first and second overtone pulsation as well as population ii pulsators ( w vir , rv tau etc ) .",
    "the most prominent example is probably the ogle project which provided a well established plr based on @xmath6 , and @xmath4 observations of @xmath7  3400 @xmath2  cep stars in lmc and smc ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the nearest example of a cepheid population in a typical large spiral galaxy of roughly solar metallicity and outside our own milky way galaxy is the one in the andromeda galaxy m31 .",
    "the first detections go back to @xcite .",
    "@xcite summarize the early observational results which already comprised a sample size of @xmath7  260 cepheid variables .",
    "wide field ccd imagers time series studies brought m31 again into the focus of several projects aiming to detect and study transients and variables stars ( e.g. @xcite , the direct project ; , ) .",
    "the sample ( based on the wecapp micro lensing project was observed over almost 8 years with ground based ccd imaging centered on the m31 bulge .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2  cep stars as typical population i objects are only a minor contribution ( 33 ) to the total sample of variable stars and they are even outnumbered by other types of cepheids ( 93 ) .    the sample was obtained from observations covering the north - west quarter of the m31 disk .",
    "spanning almost 5 years , the @xmath7  250 observations in @xmath5 and @xmath3 allowed to obtain a sample of 416 cepheid stars , to study their light curves in detail and to derive distance estimates to m31 .",
    "a shortcoming of the direct data is that the 250 individual observations were obtained in 21 nights only .",
    "the window function ( inherent to the observations ) implies a strong bias against finding objects within certain period ranges .",
    "this can distort results like e.g. the period - number distribution of the sample .",
    "ground - based m31 observations have been supplemented with single epoch high resolution hst - imaging ( phat , @xcite ) , especially in the nir .",
    "this allowed to improve on some of the short - comings of ground - based data for this galaxy and paved the way for a precise distance determination of m31 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we expand the studies of the cepheid population in m31 with our wide field ground based data taken within the first year of the pan - starrs 1 project @xcite . among others ,",
    "the two major advantages of our data are that , firstly , they cover the complete m31 disk , and , secondly , they are much more evenly distributed in time using observations taken in up to 102 nights ( @xmath8 of the nights have two epochs , giving a total of 183 epochs ) .    throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to fundamental mode ( fm ) cepheids ( classical @xmath2  cep variable stars ) , first overtone ( fo ) cepheids ( classical @xmath2  cep variable stars pulsating in the excited mode of the first overtone ) , type ii cepheids ( w virginis ) and use the term cepheids for all three subgroups .",

    "the 1.8  m panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( pan - starrs , @xcite , @xcite ) on haleakala , maui , began its regular survey in spring 2010 .",
    "pan - starrs 1 ( ps1 ) uses the giga pixel camera ( gpc , @xcite ) which is currently one of the largest cameras in the world .",
    "it consists of 60 otas ( orthogonal transfer arrays ) , each of them segmented into an array of @xmath9 cells .",
    "the total number of pixels is @xmath10 , with a pixel size of 0.258 arcsec .",
    "the fov of one ota is @xmath11 .",
    "the aims of ps1 are to map 3@xmath12 of the sky in @xmath13 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 bands .",
    "in addition to the large 3@xmath12 area some fields are visited more frequently and have deeper exposure times .",
    "one of these so called medium deep fields targets the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) . with the @xmath77  deg@xmath16 field of view of pan - starrs , a complete monitoring of the disk and large parts of the halo is possible with one single exposure .",
    "the pandromeda survey observes m31 for 0.5 h per night ( including overhead ) during a period of 5 months per year , equivalent to 2% of the overall ps1 time .",
    "we split the integration time into two visits per night ( separated by @xmath17 ) , for the whole season in the @xmath0 band and 5 exposures of @xmath18 in the @xmath1 band are taken .",
    "the total integration time per night is therefore @xmath19 .",
    "the remaining time is spent on readout , focusing and filter change . ] . during the first two seasons we focused on the filters @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite . observing m31 two times per night with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters is a consequence of the pandromeda survey goal to find microlensing events as described in @xcite .    in",
    "the first season pandromeda monitored m31 from 2010 - 07 - 23 to 2011 - 12 - 27 . in this work we used in addition",
    "part of the second season from 2011 - 07 - 25 to 2011 - 08 - 12 .",
    "this results in a gap of about half a year in the light curves and gives us a total of 183 epochs .",
    "the details of the data reduction for pandromeda are described in @xcite . in the following section we summarize the data reduction steps and point out differences to the approach taken in this work .",
    "the gpc1 exposures are de - biased , flat - fielded , and astrometrically calibrated using the pan - starrs image processing pipeline ( ipp ; @xcite ) . during this process",
    "the images are remapped to a common grid , the so called skycells .",
    "these warped images have a pixel scale of 0.200 arcsec / pixel , which is smaller than the natural pixel size of the gpc1 ( 0.258 arcsec / pixel ) . for better data management we integrated our pipeline @xcite into the astrowise data management system @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use only data from 24 skycells , namely 039 - 041 , 051 - 054 , 064 - 068 , 076 - 079 , 088 - 092 , 102 - 104 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.skycelllayout ] , the skycell layout is not optimized in the sense that it does not follow the detector boundaries .",
    "we plan to optimize the skycell layout and use an intrinsic pixel scale close to 0.258 arcsec / pixel in the future .",
    "the following data reduction steps are applied to each skycell and both filters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig.skycelllayout ]    since we use difference image photometry @xcite , we have to produce a stack of images with the best seeing , the so called reference image .",
    "we photometrically align the 70 best seeing images , so that the images have the same zero point and the same ( non zero ) sky background . in the next step",
    "we replace masked areas in the photometrically aligned images with values from another image that has the most similar psf ( @xcite , p. 134 ) .",
    "the weighted stack of the aligned images is called the reference image",
    ".    we use sextractor to detect sources on the reference image . for the data utilized in this work",
    ", sextractor is used in a mode that modifies the detection threshold depending on the background .",
    "while this mode is very useful it hampers completeness tests .    for all sources in the reference image , we perform psf photometry on a background ( sky and m31 ) subtracted reference image . in order to obtain the background in the reference image",
    ", we fit a bicubic spline model . to suppress blending effects we iteratively subtract neighboring stars .",
    "the fluxes measured in the reference image are added later to the fluxes in the difference images , so as to create the light curves . the flux error in the reference image determined by the psf photometry",
    "does not take into account how well our constant psf model matches the real sources in the reference frame which can show slight psf - variation over the field .",
    "this can result in wrong flux errors . to obtain reasonable errors",
    "we rescale the error of each source with the @xmath20 of its psf fit .    to minimize masking and to obtain a better signal - to - noise ratio we stack the images of each visit .",
    "the procedure is the same as for the reference images .",
    "the visit stacks are photometrically aligned to the reference image , so that the visit stacks and the reference image have the same zero point and sky background . at this point",
    "they only deviate in signal - to - noise and psf - shape .    to create the difference images we first align the psf of the reference image to match the psf of the visit stack by calculating a constant convolution kernel by least - squares minimization from all pixels in subareas of @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this psf aligned reference image is then subtracted from the visit stack . on this difference image",
    "we perform psf photometry to obtain light curves .",
    "the psf is constructed with sub - pixel precision from the convolved reference image using isolated stars .",
    "since we only measure the flux difference we add the flux measured in the reference image to this flux difference to obtain the light curves for the resolved sources .",
    "[ fig.pipeline ] summarizes the pandromeda data reduction pipeline .",
    "note that the astrometric precision and photometric stability have been discussed in @xcite . for the flux calibration",
    "we make use of the fact , that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands are rather similar to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands and thus the flux calibration should be insensitive to color terms @xcite . to calibrate our magnitude to the sdss magnitude system with stars from sdss we use :    @xmath24\\ ] ]    @xmath25 is the flux of a source determined by psf photometry in the reference image and @xmath26 the flux determined by psf photometry in the difference image .",
    "@xmath27 accounts for the difference between sdss magnitudes and our instrumental magnitudes and does also consider the psf construction .",
    "our pipeline does not take into account the correlated noise that arises from the change of the pixel scale . to quantify this we constructed light curves of all pixels ,",
    "normalize each single deviation from the fitted mean by its error .",
    "the distribution of these normalized deviations is clearly dominated by the non - varying pixels .",
    "then the correction factor can easily be estimated by comparing this distribution with a standard gaussian - distribution ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this rescaling factor is the same for every skycell and filter .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the ab magnitude system .",
    "the periodicity of the light curves is determined with the software sigspec .",
    "sigspec calculates a quantity called _ spectral significance _ ( sig ) for each peak in the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) amplitude spectrum of a light curve .",
    "similar to the false alarm probability is the integrated probability density function and describes the probability that an amplitude exceeds a given limit @xmath29 as described in . ]",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31\\ ] ] is a measure for the probability that a peak arises from noise .",
    "this value does not only depend on the amplitude and frequency , but also on the phase and the sampling of the light curve .",
    "this fact gives sigspec an advantage over the use of other fourier based algorithms such as the lomb - scargle algorithm ( , @xcite ) . while both methods produce comparable results concerning the period , we found that sigspec finds more periodic light curves over a given false alarm probability threshold than the lomb - scargle algorithm .",
    "this is due to the fact that certain periods have to be excluded in the lomb - scargle algorithm , depending on the sampling of the light curve in order to avoid aliasing .    in the following paragraph",
    "we outline the parameters with which we run sigspec . as statistical weight",
    "we use the inverse variance ( @xmath32 ) of the psf flux measurement and we use @xmath33 $ ] for the epoch .",
    "we apply a @xmath34-threshold of 5 ( siglimit 5 ) to determine the periodicity of the light curves .",
    "this means that in less than one out of @xmath35 cases pure noise could produce the measured period . with a lower threshold",
    "the number of detections would increase ( e.g. by a factor of @xmath36 with a threshold of 3 ) , but most of the detections would be low signal - to - noise detections . with the parameter ufreq 1",
    "we define the lowest period to be considered as 1 day .",
    "we exclude smaller periods because they can hardly be detected with a sampling of two visits per night .",
    "an upper limit for the period has not been defined , but a period cut is performed later on .",
    "the last two parameters ( multisine : lock and iterations 1 ) force sigspec to consider only the most significant peak in the dft amplitude spectrum ensuring that noise has no impact on the determined period .",
    "we use no variability index since sigspec only determines periods for variable sources .",
    "inspection by eye of the folded light curves , that sigspec detects , showed the good performance in the period determination of sigspec .",
    "one problem , however is the lack of an upper period limit that permits sigspec to determine periods even if the signal is not periodic .",
    "the inspection showed that for large periods some of the folded light curves look like cepheid light curves .",
    "we did not exclude those light curves at this stage , but rather applied a period cut later on . as our data set also contains 10 days of observations of season 2011 ,",
    "the data show a gap of half a year between these data points and the 2010 data points . in some cases",
    "the 2011 data points have a small flux shift from the 2010 data points in the folded light curve .",
    "this may have different reasons .",
    "firstly the shift could be due to flux variations .",
    "secondly it could be caused by a small deviation from the true period , which can be observed in the folded light curve if the period is small enough . and",
    "lastly the frequency spacing used by sigspec could be too low .",
    "also in the case of rv tauri variables sigspec detects the wrong period , as it identifies the time span between the primary and secondary minimum as the period .",
    "we identified and rejected those light curves manually . from 724894 sources that were detected in the @xmath0 band and which have light curves in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band band and",
    "therefore there is always a light curve in the @xmath0 band for each variable source .",
    "but the same source can be masked in the @xmath1 band so that there is no light curve in the @xmath1 band .",
    "] , sigspec finds 75362 periodic variable light curves with @xmath37 .    since sigspec",
    "does not determine the period error , we use the bootstrap method to estimate the period uncertainties .",
    "a random sampling is drawn from the light curve ( one epoch can be drawn multiple times ) and the period for that sampling is determined with sigspec ( with a @xmath34-threshold of 1 ) .",
    "this procedure is performed 1000 times for each light curve , so that the @xmath38 error can be determined from the resulting distribution .",
    "the obtained period errors for the cepheids of the 3-dimensional parameter space classified cepheid catalog ( see section [ 2.6 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.pererror ] .",
    "the classification of the different cepheid types shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.pererror ] , as well as the meaning of the 3-dimensional parameter space classified cepheid catalog , is described in the next section .    in general the period errors",
    "are small , except for some light curves where the distribution has an additional peak at @xmath39 due to aliasing . for those light curves",
    "the large error is only caused by this additional peak .",
    "it is not a broader distribution that causes the larger error and therefore the period error would be small if there is no aliasing .",
    "since we find no aliasing in the final cepheid light curves and the systematics have a larger effect than the period errors , we disregard the period errors , which means that the period errors shown in the plots do not contribute to any selection criteria or fit .",
    "as described in the previous section we narrowed the number of variable sources down to those that have periodic light curves . in this sample of variable sources we want to identify the cepheids .    the classical approach to find the cepheids ( e.g. @xcite , ) is to preselect sources in a certain brightness and color range and to visually inspect them .",
    "but the position of the instability strip spans an area depending on brightness and color ( @xcite and , including the updates by @xcite ) and is incorrectly described by a rectangle in the color - magnitude diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.wesenheit ] ) . for our color cut",
    "we therefore use the instability strip of the cepheids translated into our filter system ( @xcite , , @xcite ) .",
    "we choose a different approach than the visual inspection and establish an automatic cepheid detection .",
    "the motivation for this is that the selection based purely on light curves is always biased , in particular if the light curves become more noisy .",
    "we define limits in a 3-dimensional parameter space which define our cepheids . in order to define the parameter space we select a subsample of the periodic light curves and",
    "visually select the cepheids .",
    "the manual selection is of course also biased , but the advantage of this method is that the selection of the remaining cepheids only depends on the defined parameter space .",
    "the parameters used are derived from a fourier decomposition of the light curves . with this method",
    "we were also able to identify the cepheid type .",
    "the fundamental mode cepheids and the first overtone cepheids can be distinguished this way as e.g. shown by @xcite and .",
    "we can additionally also distinguish the type ii cepheids from the other two mentioned cepheid types .",
    "+ additionally we impose certain requirements on the remaining variable sources detected by sigspec , so as to exclude bad light curves .    in the following sections we describe our approach that we outlined here .",
    "a fourier decomposition of the folded light curves can be used to distinguish between fundamental mode ( fm ) cepheids and first overtone ( fo ) cepheids ( @xcite , ) .",
    "we also use fourier decomposition to identify type ii cepheids and to define the 3-dimensional parameter space in which we detect the cepheids .",

    "prior to the fit we convert the flux to magnitudes and fold the light curves , so that they show the variation of the magnitude over the phase @xmath44 times the period$ ] and not @xmath45 $ ] , what would be the case for folded light curves that vary over the phase . ]",
    "@xmath41 . with this fit",
    "we determine the minimum and maximum of the light curve and the coefficients @xmath46 .",
    "we also calculate the magnitude of the mean flux , needed later for the plr .",
    "this is different to a mean magnitude , which we would get if we take the mean of the light curve .",
    "for this reason we transform the fourier series fit back to flux and calculate the mean flux and then convert this to a mean magnitude .    for an analysis of the fourier decomposition we transform the fourier series to the form : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this allows us to calculate the amplitude ratio @xmath50 and the phase difference @xmath51 for each light curve .",

    "this is why we do not determine the optimal d.o.f . for each light curve as e.g. described in .",

    "young stars are located in spiral arms which are also populated by interstellar dust .",

    "therefore , even for the majority of the population ii objects an understanding of the internal reddening is required for each single object .    as already mentioned the preselection of sources in a certain brightness and color range depends on the instability strip .",
    "but it also depends on the reddening . by using the wesenheit magnitude",
    "the brightness is independent of reddening and only the color is affected by extinction .",

    "while the wesenheit magnitude is independent of extinction , the color is not .",
    "therefore we apply an extinction correction to the colors .",
    "we use the @xmath81 map from and the foreground extinction of m31 derived by @xcite with @xmath82 and apply the recalibration factor of 0.86 @xcite , to determine a mean extinction for each light curve depending on its ( projected ) position : @xmath83    note that for cepheids that are outside the montalto et al .",
    "map we only corrected for the foreground extinction .",
    "obviously we could use an extinction corrected magnitude and use it instead of the wesenheit , but since the correction is associated with a large systematic uncertainty it is better to use the wesenheit , which does not require an extinction correction .",

    "in which part of the @xmath41 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 3-dimensional parameter space the cepheids are located , we need a training set of cepheids which we obtain from a manual classification , i.e. by visual inspection of the preselected light curves .    the visual inspection of a subsample of cepheid candidates and admission or rejection of cepheids based on the light curve can lead to a bias if the cepheid subsample itself does not represent all cepheid types .",
    "the most unbiased way to select a cepheid candidate subsample for manual classification is to use the _ spectral significance _ ( sig ) . on the one hand the significance threshold has to be chosen low enough to contain a fair amount of cepheids , so that there are enough cepheids for the exploration of the 3 dimensional parameter space .",
    "on the other hand , we do not want the cepheid candidate subsample to contain so many cepheids already , that the classification with the parameter space does not detect significantly more cepheids than the subsample .    for the manual classification we thus selected all light curves that have @xmath85 in the @xmath86band . as reference light curves for the manual classification we used the cepheid light curves from @xcite .    the resulting manual classified subsample contains 1020 cepheids .",
    "this subsample makes up @xmath7 50% of the final cepheid sample .",
    "as already mentioned in section [ fdecomp ] the fourier decomposition can be used to distinguish between fm cepheids and fo cepheids .",

    "[ fig.fourierman ] shows these projections for the manually classified cepheid catalog .",
    "when looking at the cepheids in a 3-dimensional plot in @xmath87-@xmath88-p space , it becomes clear that there are indeed three different relatively well separated distributions with only small overlap areas .",
    "the fm cepheids correspond to the  v - shaped  sequence that can be seen in in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.fourierman ] . in a 3-dimensional plot",
    "the fm sequence appears spiral shaped and the two branches are shifted slightly from one another .",
    "the fo cepheid sequence is perpendicular to the fm sequence , but there is also an overlap regime between them where fm and fo objects can be hardly distinguished . for objects in or near this overlap area",
    "the classification into fm or fo is therefore rather uncertain as a real parameter overlap seems to be present .",
    "we additionally find a third sequence not present in @xcite and and corresponding to type ii cepheids .",
    "this sequence is more distinct from the fm cepheids than the fo cepheids , nevertheless there is also a transition between the two .    in a first step",
    "we define the parameter space where most of the fo cepheids and the type ii cepheids are located and assign the according type to the cepheid .",

    "[ fig.fourierman ] shows the three different sequences .",
    "nevertheless there are transitions between the sequences .",
    "there are fm cepheids in the fo and type ii parameter space and fo cepheids or rather type ii cepheids in the fm sequence . in order to account for these ambiguous cases we identify these cepheids in a second step by using the period - wesenheit relation . by using the wesenheit and not the @xmath0 band",
    "we get a classification independent of reddening .",
    "we perform iterative @xmath91 clipping for a linear relation ( @xmath92 , c.f .",

    "[ fig.pwesenheitman ] shows that this classification works well , but also indicates the problem with this approach .",

    "note that the following criteria can be applied in any order .",
    "table [ tabcuts ] summarizes the selection cuts .    the first two criteria ( slowromancap1@ & slowromancap2@ ) concern the period of the light curve .",

    "our data covers approximately 150 days in 2010 and a few days only in 2011 . while inspecting the light curves by eye",
    ", these few days in 2011 can help to confirm that the detected period is valid , even if the period is @xmath94 .",
    "however since there is a gap of approximately half a year between the 2010 and 2011 data with only few days of observations in 2011 , the light curve could be irregular in the time span of the gap and the data points in 2011 could fit to the folded light curve by chance .",
    "we decided therefore to select only light curves with periods below 75 days ( slowromancap1@ ) , so that the whole period cycle is sampled at least twice in the 2010 data .",
    "we note that there could very well be cepheids with larger periods than that , but we will be able to confirm those only after the release of the full 2011 data .",
    "the second criterion ( slowromancap2@ ) is that the period determined in the @xmath1 filter differs from that in the @xmath0 filter by less than one percent .",
    "this criterion excludes most of the light curves ( 84 % ) .",
    "we do not require a light curve to contain more than a certain number of epochs .",
    "the reason for this is that we use the fourier series fit and the polynomial fit to account for gaps in the data that might be problematic and produce  overshoots  .",

    "all other criteria only concern the @xmath0 band .    in order to also exclude less extreme  overshoots",
    " , we apply criterion slowromancap5@ , which selects only light curves with similar fourier series fit and polynomial fit .",
    "we check for similarity by calculating the area between both fits and demand that the area @xmath99 is below a threshold .",
    "the median of this area is @xmath100 and the largest area is @xmath101 for the 3-dimensional parameter space classified cepheid catalog .",
    "so our threshold of 30 is quite high when compared to those numbers , but the  overshoots  usually produce orders of magnitude larger values than this threshold .",
    "the choice of the threshold is arbitrary to some degree , although the threshold of 30 has proven to work well .",
    "the last two selection criteria ( slowromancap6@ & slowromancap7@ ) concern the noise in the folded light curves .",
    "if the maximum and minimum of the fourier series fit are similar , we can not exclude that the light curve is constant and the variation is caused by noise .",
    "additionally light curves affected by blending have smaller amplitudes",

    "but in contrast to the @xmath116 clipping that is used in section [ 2.6 ] for the period - wesenheit relation , we use the dispersion of the data points relative to the best fit relation ( which we calculate for each iteration step ) as an error for each cepheid magnitude .",
    "otherwise the small errors would result in the elimination of most of the cepheids , instead of just clipping the systematic outliers . in comparison",
    "the use of the dispersion is not necessary for the period - wesenheit clipping since the errors in the wesenheit index are large .",
    "the slopes , zero points , the numerical fit errors of these values and the dispersion of the different relations are given in table [ tabpl ] for a linear fit of the form : @xmath117 for comparison we also added the period - wesenheit relation from fig .

    "the value of the slope @xmath118 and the values for the intersection @xmath119 in the usually applied linear approximation of the plr have been a long standing matter of debate ( see section [ chapterintro ] and literature cited therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite derived slope values from basic physical principles taking into account the surface temperature and effective surface area .",
    "these slope values depend on wavelength ( expressed as observing band dependence ) .",
    "the predictions of @xcite agree rather well with empirical values of ( milky way cepheids ) and of @xcite ( lmc ) including the wavelength dependence . @xcite",

    "if our sample would be dominated by the long period cepheids , this would explain why the slopes of our full sample do not agree with the slopes of @xcite for all cepheids .",
    "therefore we want to compare the slopes of the short period ( @xmath124 ) cepheids to those of the long period cepheids .",
    "simple linear fits to the short period samples provide almost similar slopes to those of to the long period samples , but with a different zero points .",
    "this means that the fits for the different period ranges are not continuous at 10 days .",
    "hence we introduce a different procedure for the fit of the broken slope proposal .",
    "we fit two linear slopes ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) with a common suspension point ( @xmath127 ) at 10 days ( @xmath128 ) : @xmath129 for the fm cepheids in the @xmath0 band this results in @xmath130 with a dispersion of 0.36345 for the short periods and a dispersion of 0.55620 for the long periods .",
    "this fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fmknick ] .",
    "as can be seen also this fit with a common suspension point does produce similar slopes for the short and long period cepheids .    to check",
    "if the dispersion of the plr is concealing a steeper slope we generate a simulated subsample for the short period cepheids ( in the @xmath0 band ) in such a way that the periods of the cepheids stay the same , but the magnitude is given by a gaussian distribution around the slope -2.8 .",
    "the width of the gaussian distribution is chosen to be the dispersion of the common suspension fit of the short period cepheids .",
    "the subsample of the long period cepheids stays the same .",
    "we generate 100000 gaussian distributions and perform the common suspension point fit .",
    "the resulting distribution of the short period slopes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.gauss ] . as can be seen the shallow slope of the short period subsample can not be explained by the dispersion of the plr .",
    "the most likely explanation for the shallow slope at short periods is that we seem to select the brighter cepheids at short periods due to the malmquist bias and that most short period cepheids are too faint to be detected , so that we can not determine the slope for the short periods correctly . to confirm this",
    "we would need to perform completeness tests that are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless the good agreement of our empirical values for the long period cepheids with the predictions of @xcite supports the finding of of a different slope for long and short period cepheids , depending on the observational band , and the more general prediction of a curvature term in the plr .",
    "we now investigate the location of the cepheids in the m31 plane .",
    "[ fig.radec3d ] shows the position of the cepheids plotted over the e(b - v ) map of .",
    "the fm and fo cepheids are concentrated towards the disk and clearly show a ring like structure ( left panel in fig .",

    "the spatial distribution of fm and fo cepheids can be used to obtain a spatial age distribution for m31 .",
    "we use the period - age relation for fm and fo cepheids given by @xcite to determine the age of each cepheid . the spatial age distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.age ] indicates that star formation in the last @xmath131 was concentrated in a ring which is in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "[ fig.age ] also hints a correlation between the cepheid age and the distance to the center of m31 .    in order to check for this correlation",
    "we deproject the spatial distribution .",
    "we use @xmath132 for the inclination and @xmath133 for the tilt angle and the radius and offset of the 10 kpc ring given by @xcite .",

    "[ fig.gordondeproj ] .",
    "we found the splitting of the ring as previously described in @xcite .",
    "@xcite attributes the star formation of the ring and its splitting to a passage of m32 through the m31 disk . in a next step",

    "the upper left corner of the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.gradient ] contains no cepheids . in this region ( the center of m31 )",
    "the signal to noise ratio is low , so that this is likely the reason that we hardly detect faint cepheids ( i.e. cepheids with small periods ; the study of the detection efficiency for cepheids will be subject of a further work ) and thus we hardly detect old cepheids in this region . in the seventh bin",
    "we detect old ( faint ) cepheids but no young cepheids , although they should be more easily detectable than old cepheids .",
    "therefore the lack of young cepheids in the outer region of the ring is no selection bias .",
    "this leaves us with the conclusion that the age gradient is real . to measure the strength of the age gradient we perform a fit to the median age with @xmath136 : @xmath137 \\\\    b = 33.8517 \\pm 0.6100 ~ [ myr / deg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a @xmath138 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the median age of the stellar population decreases by @xmath139 inwards .",
    "a possible interpretation for this is that the star formation is related to the interaction with m32 moving inwards .",

    "we develop an automatic cepheid detection and classification scheme based on the fourier parameters @xmath41 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the location of the instability strip in the wesenheit - color plane .",
    "this makes the cepheid detection and classification less biased than traditional methods and facilitates cepheid detection in large surveys .",
    "we find 1440 fundamental mode ( fm ) cepheids , 126 cepheids in the first overtone mode ( fo ) , 147 belonging to the population ii types and 296 cepheids that could not be classified .",

    "the matching tables are provided in electronical form .",
    "the spatial distribution of fm and fo cepheids follows the 10 kpc ring in m31 , while the type ii cepheids are distributed throughout the halo of m31 .",
    "the spatial age distribution shows a positive age gradient with increasing distance from the 10 kpc ring , which implies that the star formation in the 10 kpc ring moved inwards .",
    "the analysis of our period luminosity relations ( plr ) indicates that the plr is slightly curved .",
    "this has ramifications on the determination of extra galactic distances , since most of the commonly used calibrations of the plr are dominated by the short period cepheids and the typical cepheids that are used for the extra galactic distance determination are long period cepheids",
