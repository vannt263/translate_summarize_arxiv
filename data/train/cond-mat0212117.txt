    "is long compared to that of the transition in between , the path @xmath132 is often called an `` instanton '' in the literature .",
    "if we consider now the limiting case @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( in the following abbreviated as @xmath139 ) , there exists a well defined limit of @xmath132 , in the sense that this path follows ever closer the periodic orbits , while retaining the shape of the intermediate segment . at the same time",
