    "what roles do magnetic fields play in molecular clouds ? within clouds ,",
    "important forces include gravity , gas pressure , cosmic ray pressure , and magnetic fields ; however , they are not independent of each other . for example , @xcite point out that cosmic rays and gas pressure are coupled through the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field may be a major factor in cloud dynamics across many scales and may be a key agent in regulating the rate of star formation @xcite . yet , the magnetic field is difficult to sense and harder still to map in much detail .    in the hot ionized interstellar medium , magnetic fields are probed in diffuse regions through faraday rotation of background pulsars @xcite and extragalactic sources @xcite , as well as through synchrotron emission @xcite . in cold , denser regions ,",
    "the magnetic fields are probed through zeeman splitting of spectral lines @xcite , polarized thermal emission from aligned dust @xcite , and polarization of background starlight by aligned dust @xcite .",
    "zeeman splitting and faraday rotation measure the line - of - sight magnetic field strength ; the other methods trace the orientation of the magnetic field on the plane of the sky .",
    "chandrasekhar & fermi ( 1953a ; hereafter cf ) derived an estimate of the plane - of - sky magnetic field strength using the dispersion of the starlight polarization position angles ( p.a.s ) , the local gas motions , and the local gas density .",
    "polarization of background starlight , first observed by @xcite and @xcite , has been attributed to elongated dust grains aligned by local magnetic fields .",
    "early alignment mechanisms were proposed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite provides a comprehensive history of grain alignment .",
    "currently , the favored model for dust alignment is the radiative torque mechanism @xcite . with radiative torques , spinning anisotropic dust grains preferentially align their long axes perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "unpolarized background starlight sees a higher extinction cross - section perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction and the light picks up a small linear polarization parallel to the projected magnetic field direction . with this mechanism operating ,",
    "magnetic fields can be probed within molecular clouds using optical or near - infrared polarimetric observations of background stars .",
    "the galactic plane infrared polarization survey ( gpips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from which these data are drawn , is a near - infrared , linear polarization survey that measures the polarization of background starlight in the inner galactic mid - plane ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , to and beyond the nearest spiral arm .",
    "this survey obtains @xmath2-band ( 1.6  @xmath7 m ) linear polarizations for apparent magnitudes from 7th to beyond 14th .",
    "this same galactic region has already been surveyed by @xmath17 @xcite , nvss @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , glimpse @xcite , the @xmath5co galactic ring survey ( grs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 2mass @xcite , mipsgal @xcite , @xmath19 @xcite , and bgps @xcite , and so offers excellent data sets for correlative analysis .",
    "the newly available gpips background starlight polarimetry , with its roughly one  arcmin stellar sampling , is ideal for exploring the nature of magnetic fields within molecular clouds .",
    "a key first step is to measure and characterize the magnetic field within an average molecular cloud that is not engaged in active star formation . with gpips polarimetric data , combined with velocity information from grs",
    ", the cf method can be used to create a resolved map of a cloud s embedded plane - of - sky magnetic field strength .",

    "values of mass - to - flux above unity correspond to supercritical ( gravity dominated ) conditions and values below unity correspond to subcritical ( magnetic dominated ) conditions .",

    "however , magnetic field strengths measured in this work are plane - of - sky values .",

    "this map has an effective angular resolution of 100 arcsec ( 0.9 pc ) , a result made possible by the large number of gpips background starlight polarization measurements and coincident @xmath5co gas information . combined with estimates of the cloud thickness and polarization position angle dispersion , the magnetic field was able to be estimated using the cf method for over 900 independent cloud directions .",
    "it is with these magnetic field estimates that we next explore relationships between magnetic field strength and gas density as well as between magnetic fields and cloud evolution .      within molecular clouds ,",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath71 is correlated with gas density @xmath97 .",

    "recently , @xcite completed a comprehensive analysis of zeeman measurements from the literature , attempting to quantify the actual magnetic field strength probability distribution function ( pdf ) by comparing the observed line - of - sight magnetic field strength pdf with different models .",
    "the h0.1emi zeeman measurements are particularly relevant because they probe densities similar to the average density found here for cloud 1 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the magnetic field is consistent with a two - part model wherein magnetic field strength is independent of n@xmath101 below 300  @xmath14 and @xmath102 above 300  @xmath14 .",

    "the trend seen for cloud 1 is inconsistent with the constant magnetic field strength below 300 @xmath14 in the model of @xcite .",
    "previous work had suggested that below some threshold gas density ( between 100 and 300 @xmath14 ) , the @xmath71-@xmath97 relationship broke down @xcite .",
    "the cloud 1 results presented here show that the @xmath71-@xmath97 relationship survives to the low densities probed in grsmc 45.60 + 0.30 , and with an index nearly identical to the one found at higher densities by @xcite .",
    "the role of magnetic fields in the support of grsmc 45.60 + 0.30 was revealed by the predominance of subcritical values for the mass - to - flux ratios , calculated in sec .",
    "5.4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftm ] , many areas of cloud  1 are magnetically - supported against collapse , including the high - density cores .",
    "importantly , since the mass - to - flux values are upper limits , all subcritical designations are robust .    all of the magnetic cores are subcritical ; the magnetic fields likely provide important magnetostatic support .",
    "though the effects of turbulence were not considered , including them would only _ reduce _ the magnetic support necessary to prevent collapse , making the cores even more stable against gravity .",
    "the magnetic cores are coincident with the high column density regions seen in the @xmath5co integrated intensity map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coint ] ) .",
    "the arrangement of the magnetic cores along the cloud s spine of more general @xmath5co emission and the overall alignment of the spine with the projected magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : paspine ] ) suggest that the magnetic field may be important in the formation and evolution of both the cloud and the cores .",
    "the enhancement of the magnetic field in the high - density regions suggests that the magnetic field has been amplified as the cores formed from more diffuse intercore gas .",
    "the average magnetic field strength for the cores is about 1.5 times the mean magnetic field strength for the cloud ( @xmath8 @xmath7 g versus @xmath6 @xmath7 g ) .",
    "the core mean plane - of - sky magnetic field strength is also higher than the value typically found in the cold hi phase of the ism ( 6  @xmath7 g for the full 3-d field strength ; * ? ? ?",
    "no correlation was found between gas number density in the cores and their level of mass - to - flux criticality .",
    "these cores would therefore seem to be the best example of magnetic fields , even weak ones , regulating the star formation process .",
    "it is noteworthy that 8  @xmath7 g magnetic fields can prevent these @xmath108  m@xmath109 dense cores from collapsing for what must be at least several free - fall times .",
    "the existence of magnetic cores that are coincident with regions of high @xmath5co density and that are relatively uniformly spaced may relate to theories of fragmentation for a self - gravitating fluid cylinder ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  sausage  instability ) . following the approach of @xcite",
    ", cloud  1 could be considered to be either an incompressible fluid or an infinite isothermal gas cylinder , yielding two distinct characteristic core spacings . for the conditions present in cloud  1 , these spacings are 13 and 17 pc , respectively .",
    "they are both larger than the measured mean core spacing of @xmath10  pc . because of the low volume densities present in cloud  1 , the gravitationally - driven  sausage \" instability is unlikely to account for the observed core spacing .",
    "the parker instability @xcite was also considered , but the expected instability scale length is also too large to account for the cloud s core spacing .",
    "by combining new nir starlight polarimetry from gpips with @xmath5co data from grs , and photometry from 2mass , the cf method was used to measure the plane - of - sky magnetic field strength across the quiescent molecular cloud grsmc 45.60 + 0.30 ( cloud 1 ) .",
    "this study yielded the following :    * the plane - of - sky magnetic field within cloud 1 is stronger and more ordered in the densest regions of the cloud and weaker in the lower density regions .",
    "the average plane - of - sky magnetic field strength is @xmath6 @xmath7 g , with a dispersion of 5.8 @xmath7 g .",
    "* seven ` magnetic cores ' were identified within cloud 1 .",
    "their average plane - of - sky magnetic field strength is @xmath8 @xmath7 g , their average peak strength is @xmath86 @xmath7 g , their average radius is @xmath9 pc , and their average mass is @xmath89  m@xmath109 . * the average intercore distance is @xmath10 pc , with core - to - core distances spanning 3.5 pc to 8.2 pc .",
    "neither the  sausage \" nor parker instabilities can account for the short spacings seen in this cloud . * the magnetic cores all have subcritical mass - to - flux ratios .",
    "the cores appear magnetically - supported against collapse , likely inhibiting star formation .",
    "this may be the best evidence to date for the vital role played by the magnetic field in regulating star formation . * the power law index linking magnetic field strength and gas number density is @xmath110 this work extends this relation to lower densities than probed directly by @xcite , and this index is in disagreement with their predictions for @xmath111 @xmath14 , suggesting that the magnetic field strength and gas number density are related even in the least dense regions of clouds .",
