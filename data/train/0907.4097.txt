    "we show that the two classes of triples of mu bases given by @xmath317 and @xmath318 are _ inequivalent_. in a first step , we explain that it is sufficient to search for equivalence transformations generated by matrices of a special form . in a second step",
    "we show that a contradiction arises if one assumes that the triples @xmath319 and @xmath256 are equivalent .",
    "let us begin with a general remark about the structure of equivalence classes of sets of mu bases @xmath320 of @xmath321 for all @xmath322 . for convenience ,",
    "we assume that the first basis equals the identity , i.e. the set is given in standard form .",

    "for the set @xmath328 to be in standard form , one of the bases in @xmath323 , say @xmath329 , must be mapped to the identity . as a consequence , the overall unitary transformation @xmath252 must have a particular form , namely @xmath330 where @xmath331 is some monomial matrix and @xmath329 is one of the matrices contained in the set @xmath323 . in view of eq .",

    "it turns out that both triples are _ invariant _ under these global transformations as we have the equivalences @xmath336and @xmath337the first equivalence in ( [ invariant triple 1 ] ) follows from using @xmath338 and eq .",
    "( [ fdaggeraction2 ] ) while the second one also requires the identity @xmath339with some monomial matrix @xmath271 .",
    "the equivalences ( [ invariant triple 2 ] ) are derived in a similar way .",
    "consequently , we can always remove the effect of the matrices @xmath340 in the global transformations ( [ u is special ] ) which leaves us with @xmath341 where @xmath342 and @xmath254 are monomial matrices , and up to rearranging terms .",
    "the non - zero entries of the monomial matrix @xmath331 must , in fact , be fifth roots of unity but we will not need this fact has a nonzero element different from a fifth root , say @xmath343 .",
    "this makes it impossible to transform @xmath319 into standard form using right multiplication by monomial matrices unless the other nonzero elements of @xmath331 also equal @xmath344 .",
    "it follows that @xmath331 must be a permutation matrix @xmath268 apart from a phase factor , @xmath345 .",
    "thus the matrices @xmath346 must have a common factor of @xmath347 which , however , is irrelevant for the definition of mu bases ] .    using the restricted transformations shown in eqs .",
    "( [ limited trfs ] ) , the triples @xmath348 and @xmath349 are equivalent to each other only if either @xmath350 or @xmath351 hold for some monomial matrices @xmath352 and @xmath254 . the choice @xmath353 in eqs .",
    "( [ limited trfs ] ) ensures that the identity will be mapped to the identity .",
    "( [ poss 1 ] ) will now be shown to imply the identity @xmath354 for some monomial matrix @xmath271 while @xmath355 is a diagonal matrix with fifth roots of unity as nonzero entries , _ not _ proportional to the identity , @xmath356 .",
    "however , eq . ( [ n removed ] ) only holds if @xmath355 _ is _ a multiple of the identity .",
    "this contradiction implies that there are no matrices @xmath357 such that eqs .",
    "( [ poss 1 ] ) hold . since eqs .",
    "( [ poss 2 ] ) also imply eq .",
    "( [ n removed ] ) with a ( possibly different ) diagonal matrix @xmath358 , the triples @xmath319 and @xmath256 can not be equivalent .",
    "use @xmath359 , to express the second equation in ( poss 1 ) as @xmath360 introducing @xmath361 .",
    "thus , the matrix @xmath362 is obtained from @xmath246 by reordering its diagonal elements according to the permutation @xmath268 defined via @xmath363 , with some unitary diagonal matrix @xmath364 . combining this equation with the first one in ( poss 1 ) leads to @xmath365 , or @xmath366 which is identical to ( [ n removed ] ) upon defining @xmath367 and @xmath368 which , as a product of two monomial matrices , is another monomial matrix .",
    "since no permutation of the elements on the diagonal of @xmath369 produces the inverse of @xmath68 or a multiple thereof , we have @xmath370 . using the pair ( [ poss 2 ] ) instead of ( [ poss 1 ] ) also leads to an equation of the form ( [ n removed ] ) with @xmath371 replaced by @xmath372 which",
    ", however , can not be a multiple of the inverse of @xmath68 , leading again to @xmath370 .",
    "we now show that eq .",
    "( [ n removed ] ) only holds if the matrix @xmath355 is proportional to the identity .",
    "write the monomial matrix @xmath271 in ( [ n removed ] ) in the form @xmath373 where @xmath268 is a permutation matrix and @xmath374 is a _",
    "diagonal _ matrix with entries having modulus one only .",
    "denoting the inverse of @xmath374 by @xmath375 , eq .",
    "( [ n removed ] ) takes the form @xmath376 let us write @xmath377 with phase factors @xmath378 , etc , and similarly for @xmath379 , and consider the simplest case @xmath380 .",
    "then the matrix relation ( [ n removed new ] ) reads explicitly @xmath381 the conditions resulting from the first row immediately imply that the elements on the diagonal of @xmath379 are all equal to @xmath382 , or @xmath383 .",
    "the conditions of the first column imply that the matrix @xmath355 is also a multiple of the identity , namely @xmath384 .",
    "this contradicts the fact that the matrix @xmath355 is different from a multiple of the identity .",
    "let us now drop the restriction the @xmath385 .",
    "the effect of @xmath268 acting on @xmath227 from the right is to permute its columns .",
    "the first row of @xmath386 will not change under this operation . under the action of @xmath268",
    ", the first column will either stay where is is or it will be mapped to one of the four others . in the first case , we can immediately apply the argument given above to derive a contradiction . in the second case , it it straightforward to see that a similar argument still applies involving the first row of the matrices and that column which is the image of the first column .",
    "thus , all possible choices of the monomial matrix @xmath271 in ( [ n removed ] ) require @xmath355 to be a multiple of the identity  which it is not .",
    "finally , we consider the action of an overall complex conjugation ( conjugation )  on either of the triples .",
    "we find that the set of three mu bases , @xmath387 remains invariant under complex conjugation @xmath388similarly , complex conjugation maps @xmath256 to itself , @xmath389 . in summary",
