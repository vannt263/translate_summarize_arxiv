    "the field of optomechanics has undergone rapid development over the last decade with application in a wide variety of systems ranging from vibrating microtoroids @xcite , membranes @xcite , nanomechanical cantilevers @xcite , gravitational wave detectors ( ligo project ) @xcite and ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "the classical optomechanics is a well developed field of optical engineering . in this field ,",
    "the microelectromechanical systems form a vital component in high technology ranging from iphones to sensors . moreover",
    ", the quantum control of mechanical motion has also been achieved for the first time in ion traps @xcite .",
    "the significant goal of the field of optomechanics is to cool the optomechanical systems to their ground state @xcite .",
    "braginsky @xcite and caves @xcite performed pioneering work in this field , in which it was anticipated that the back - action arises due to the radiation pressure force applied by the light field on the movable mirror .",
    "this radiation pressure leads to the interaction between intensity of the optical field and the displacement of the moving mirror .",
    "this interaction of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom through radiation pressure has been used in the field of gravitational wave detectors @xcite and laser cooling @xcite . in the recent years , an optomechanical system containing a bec",
    "has also been examined @xcite .",
    "the dicke model has also grabbed considerable attention for decades which describes the two - level systems or spins uniformly interacting with light @xcite .",
    "if the atom - light interaction exceeds a critical value then the dicke model undergoes a continuous phase transition to a state with non - vanishing photon number and discrete parity symmetry breaking .",
    "the dicke model is reviewed with its applications in quantum optics in ref .",
    "furthermore , a direct implementation of a dicke model hamiltonian without any additional diamagnetic terms can also be provided in atomic experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was noted that a dynamical version of the superradiance transition in the dicke model is equivalent to the self - organization transition @xcite .",
    "the quantum phase transitions induced by the optical cavity field mediates long - range interactions among the atoms which may alter their behaviour .",
    "recently , it has also been predicted that a cloud of atoms with extra transverse pump undergoes a self - organization transition to a spatially modulated phase @xcite which was experimentally proved using thermal clouds in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of self - organization has been recently observed in an experiment using a bec in an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "this experimental setup gives rise to a new kind of supersolid which is formed due to the spontaneous sublattice symmetry breaking coexisting with superfluid phase coherence @xcite .",
    "it uses an optical cavity in which atomic states were replaced by the momentum states .",
    "hence , the splitting between the states can be controlled by the atomic recoil energy .",
    "this enables the observation of dicke model transition using light with optical frequencies .    motivated by these interesting developments in the field of cavity optomechanics and ultracold gases",
    ", we propose an optomechanical system consisting of a two - level bec within a high - finesse optomechanical cavity with one movable mirror .",
    "this system is used to study the theoretical analysis of the dissipative optomechanical dicke model quantum phase transition within the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is based on the linearized treatment of quantum fluctuations in the holstein - primakoff representation of the collective atomic spin and the standard input - output theory of open quantum - optical systems .",
    "we primarily study the effect of the mechanical mode of the oscillating mirror on the system dynamics with the variation in atom - photon coupling .",
    "the imaginary and real parts of the eigenvalues are analysed which demonstrates the quantum phase transition of the system .",
    "we further present the results for the cavity fluorescence spectrum that accounts for the quantum fluctuations and the homodyne spectra that measures the quadrature fluctuations of the cavity output field .",
    "the basic optomechanical system investigated here consists of a high - finesse fabry - perot optical cavity of length @xmath0 with one fixed mirror and another movable mirror of mass @xmath1 , which is free to oscillate at some mechanical frequency @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally , a single vibrational mode of the movable mirror can be considered by using a bandpass filter in the detection scheme such that the other mechanical degrees of freedom arising from the radiation pressure can be neglected @xcite .",
    "in addition , our model involves an elongated cigar - shaped gas of @xmath3 two - level @xmath4 bec atoms having mass @xmath5 and transition frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the schematic representation of the system is illustrated in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the bec atoms are strongly coupled to a single one - dimensional quantized cavity mode of frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the optical cavity is coherently driven by an external pump laser of frequency @xmath8 from a direction perpendicular to the cavity axis by acting as a constant source of photons for the cavity @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we will consider the dynamics of the system along the axis of the cavity only .",
    "the radial motion of bec is freezed out by a tight harmonic potential of frequency @xmath9 such that its spatial dimension along the cavity axis is taken into consideration only .",
    "the atom - pump detuning @xmath10 is assumed to be very large in order to suppress the spontaneous emission of photons by the atoms since this is a source of heat which can eventually destroy the condensate . here",
    ", the electronically excited atomic state is adiabatically eliminated , which is justified for large atom - laser detuning . as a result ,",
    "an effective two - level system is formed with two stable states : the atomic zero momentum state @xmath11 and the excited momentum state @xmath12 which are coupled through a pair of distinct raman channels @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath13 denotes the momenta along the cavity axis and @xmath14 represents the wave vector of pump laser field .",
    "the effective atomic transition frequency @xmath15 is twice the atomic recoil frequency @xmath16 , namely @xmath17 . in our case",
    ", the measurement of the field quadratures of the cavity mode can be performed by homodyning the cavity output field using a local oscillator with an appropiate phase @xcite .",
    "the simplest model of the system , involving all the condensate atoms with different momentum states to be identically coupled with the single - mode cavity field , is provided by the following hamiltonian in the dipole approximation @xcite :    @xmath18    in hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) , the first term describes the energy of the cavity mode where @xmath19 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity mode such that @xmath20=1 $ ] .",
    "the second term gives the energy of the single vibrational mode of the mechanical mirror with @xmath21 as the annihilation ( creation ) operator such that @xmath22=1 $ ] .",
    "third term represents the energy of the condensate atoms . here",
    ", the ensemble of @xmath3 bec atoms is described by using the picture of a collective spin which is basically the sum of effective spins @xmath23 that simply describe the internal degrees of freedom of each atom .",
    "the collective atomic operators are expressed as @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 , with the index @xmath30 labelling the atoms .",
    "these operators satisfy the angular momentum commutation relations @xmath31=2s_{z}$ ] and @xmath32=\\mp s_{\\pm}$ ] .",
    "[ fig1 ]    fourth term illustrates the interaction between the condensate field and the light field with @xmath33 being the collective atom - photon coupling strength , which can be tuned in experiment by varying the pump laser power @xcite . we are neglecting the contact interactions between the atoms of the condensate .",
    "last term in the hamiltonian represents the nonlinear dispersive coupling between the intensity of the cavity field and the position quadrature of the oscillating mirror which arises due to the radiation pressure force exerted by the intra - cavity photons on the movable mirror .",
    "this force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the movable mirror shifts the phase of the field by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the propagation wave vector of the cavity field and @xmath36 denotes the displacement of the mirror from its equilibrium position .",
    "it basically depends upon the number of photons in the cavity . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the nonlinear dispersive coupling between the intensity of the cavity field and the position quadrature of the movable mirror with @xmath38 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the movable mirror has perfect reflectivity such that the light transmission from the cavity takes place through the fixed mirror only .",
    "moreover , no direct coupling between the condensate atoms and cantilever is considered , which can be achieved by assuming that only a few lattice sites are appreciably populated near the centre of the cavity .",
    "we now turn to discuss the dynamics arising from this model . starting from the hamitonian equation ( [ ham1 ] ) ,",
    "the coupled equations of motion for the operators @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given as :    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes the cavity loss rate which arises due to the leakage of photons through the mirrors .",
    "also , the movable mirror is damped with decay constant @xmath48 due to its interaction with the environment .",
    "the condensate atoms are robust , thus , we can neglect the effects of atom loss during the experimental time @xcite .",
    "in particular , the equations of motion ( [ eq1])-([eq4 ] ) are invariant under the parity transformation    @xmath49    as in the well - known dicke model .",
    "this symmetry is spontaneously broken on passing from the normal phase to the superradiant phase @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the mean - field analysis of the system which can be demonstrated by introducing the c - number variables @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the population inversion , atomic polarization , mirror mode and complex cavity field amplitudes respectively .",

    "the steady - state solutions are evaluated with the constraint that the pseudo - angular momentum @xmath60 is conserved . while @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the trivial steady state solutions for all values of @xmath33 , they are only stable for @xmath63 . for @xmath64 , these solutions",

    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath76 and @xmath68 are the steady state population inversion , polarization amplitude , mirror mode amplitude , absolute value of cavity - field amplitude and cavity - field amplitude respectively .    in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the holstein - primakoff representation to derive the effective hamiltonian in the normal phase and in the superradiant phase within the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath77 , the optomechanical dicke hamiltonian exhibits a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) at a critical value of the atom - cavity field coupling strength @xmath59 , at which point the parity symmetry of the hamiltonian is broken . in this analysis , we make an extensive use of the holstein - primakoff representation by expressing the atomic spin operators in terms of bosonic mode operators @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath80=1 $ ] ) such that @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .    making these subtitutions into the hamiltonian of eqn.([ham1 ] ) , we obtain the following three - mode bosonic hamitonian :    @xmath84+\\hbar \\omega_{c}\\eta_{0}c^{\\dagger}c(b+b^{\\dagger}).\\ ] ]    the goal is to achieve the linearization about the semiclassical amplitudes mentioned in the previous section under the assumption @xmath77 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are small and can be treated in a linearized approach .    in the normal phase ( @xmath63 ) , the semiclassical steady states @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are zero , thus , the expansion is made directly on the operators @xmath78 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this yields an effective hamiltonian by simply neglecting terms with @xmath3 in the denominator in the full hamiltonian ( eqn.[ham2 ] ) which approximates the square root in the holstein - primakoff mapping with unity and is given as :    @xmath85    additionally , to obtain the above hamiltonian , we have omitted the constant terms and retained the terms that are bilinear in bosonic operators in the full hamiltonian of eqn.([ham2 ] ) .    in the superradiant phase ( @xmath64 ) , the semiclassical steady states @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are nonzero and all the three bosonic modes @xmath78 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 acquire macroscopic occupations . to do this ,",
    "we start with the holstein - primakoff transformed hamiltonian of eqn.([ham2 ] ) and displace the bosonic modes in the following way :    @xmath86    here @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given in eqns.([eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) respectively with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 describing the quantum fluctuations around the semiclassical amplitudes .",
    "moreover , we have defined @xmath90 . making these transformations within the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "we obtain the following hamitonian ( omitting constant terms ) :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are given in appendix a. we now eliminate the terms in @xmath100 that are linear in bosonic operators by choosing @xmath101 .",
    "this yields the final effective hamitonian in the superradiant phase as :    @xmath102    having derived the two effective hamiltonians that describe the system for all @xmath33 in the thermodynamic limit , we now study the system s properties in each of its two phases .",
    "in the normal phase ( @xmath63 ) , the effective bilinear hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) leads to the following coupled equations of motion for the expectation values of @xmath78 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 :    @xmath103    @xmath104    @xmath105    in matrix form , it can be written as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is a constant @xmath109 matrix given as :    @xmath110.\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ fig4 ]    hence , with the help of correlations given in appendix b , the homodyne spectra in the normal phase becomes :    @xmath111    similarly , the expression for the homodyne spectra in the superradiant phase becomes :    @xmath112    the expressions for @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are illustrated in appendix d. fig.4 represents the homodyne spectrum ( or quadrature noise spectrum ) @xmath121 for four different values of atom - photon coupling strength @xmath122 ( plot ( a ) ) , @xmath123 ( plot ( b ) ) , @xmath124 ( plot(c ) ) and @xmath125 ( plot ( d ) ) with @xmath126 ( solid line ) and @xmath127 ( dashed line ) . here",
    "also , we have chosen the same set of values of atom - photon coupling strength to correspond to fig.3 .",
    "the numerical results for the quadrature phase @xmath126 and @xmath127 are well presented in the figure . for @xmath126 ,",
    "some of the observations in the homodyne spectra as a function of @xmath33 are same as displayed in the fluorescence spectra .",
    "the lower frequency peaks are associated with the photonic branch , the higher frequency peaks with the atomic branch and the intermediate frquency peaks with the phononic branch . as the atom - photon coupling strength approaches its critical value @xmath59 ,",
    "the phase transition is signaled by a divergence of the quadrature amplitude fluctuations at @xmath128 for both of the quadrature phases @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( shown in fig.4(b ) ) .",
    "further note that the photonic and atomic spectral peaks in the noise spectrum get inverted at @xmath129 quadrature phase .",
    "however , the spectral peaks corresponding to phononic branch overlap for both of the quadrature phases @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the quantum noise variances or the fluctuation variances of the output field quadrature amplitudes can be effectively measured with the help of homodyne spectra . in principle , the homodyne spectra of the output cavity field can be used to determine the variance - based measures of atom - cavity field entanglement , which has been shown briefly in a recent paper @xcite . further note that the homodyne spectra is completely symmetric .",
    "this symmetry of the spectra is ensured by the energy conservation such that the values of @xmath130 and @xmath131 remain unaffected with the change in sign of @xmath132 .",
    "now , the experimentally realizable parameters used in the main paper to demonstrate the dynamics of the system are illustrated as follows .",
    "the mechanical frequency of the mirror in an optomechanical system can be varied from @xmath133hz @xcite , @xmath134khz @xcite , to @xmath135mhz @xcite with the corresponding damping rate from @xmath136hz @xcite , @xmath137hz @xcite , to @xmath138khz @xcite .",
    "the cavity field can have damping rate @xmath138mhz @xcite ( @xmath139mhz @xcite ) .",
    "a cloud of bec interacting with the light field of a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity may have a coherent coupling strength of @xmath140mhz @xcite ( @xmath141mhz @xcite ) , which is significantly larger than the cavity decay rate .",
    "it , thus , places the system firmly in a regime where the hamiltonian dynamics dominate .",
    "the high - finesse optical cavity is used to minimize the loss of photons through the cavity mirrors in order to have strong atom - cavity field coupling .",
    "the mirror - photon coupling rate is @xmath142mhz .",
    "in fact @xmath143 @xmath144 even at cryogenic temperatures , thus , it is always much larger than all the other parameters . hence , even for high values of @xmath132",
    ", one can safely approximate @xmath145\\right\\rbrace \\simeq ( 2\\gamma_{m}k_{b}t)/(\\hbar\\omega_{m})$ ] . in typical optomechanical experiments ,",
    "the limit @xmath146 is always taken into account @xcite .",
    "also , in a regime of strong - coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics , the critical regime of the dicke model can be realized with just a few atoms @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed a dissipative optomechanical dicke model in the thermodynamic limit for the detailed study of quantum phase transition involving a collective atomic pseudospin , a single quantized mode of the electromagnetic field and a single quantized mechanical mode of the movable mirror . in the eigenvalue analysis of the system ,",
    "six eigenvalues have been obtained which are grouped into three pairs , associated with the photonic , atomic and phononic branches .",
    "the phononic mode eigenvalues remain constant and imaginary for all the values of atom - photon coupling strength .",
    "moreover , for the parameter regime we have considered , the fluorescence spectra and the homodyne spectra exhibit normal mode splitting which shows the coherent energy exchange between the different modes ( photonic mode , bogoliubov mode and the mechanical mode ) of the system .",
    "both the spectra display striking behaviour in the vicinity of critical point .",
    "the most interesting observation in the fluorescence spectrum is the asymmetric coherent energy exchange between the three modes of the system in the superradiant phase .",
    "such an asymmetry arises in the presence of optomechanical interaction as a result of bloch - siegert shift and this asymmetry increases as the atom - photon coupling strength increases .",
    "moreover , the homodyne spectra of the output cavity field can be used to monitor the atom - cavity field entanglement .",
