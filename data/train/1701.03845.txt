    "very neutron - rich nuclei may emit one or more neutrons when they disintegrate via @xmath0 decay .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0-delayed neutron ( @xmath15 ) emission process , which is energetically allowed when the q@xmath16-value of the decay exceeds the neutron separation energy ( s@xmath17 ) of the daughter nucleus .",
    "the @xmath15-emission has been experimentally determined for about 230  neutron rich nuclei , spanning from @xmath1he up to @xmath2la  @xcite .",
    "most of these measurements took advantage of the large fission yields around the two fission peaks at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath0-delayed neutron emission has remained essentially inaccessible for nuclei heavier than @xmath4 , where only a minuscule value of 0.007% has been reported for the @xmath15-emission probability of @xmath3tl  @xcite . because of the scarce or non - existent @xmath15 data in the heavy mass region , rapid neutron capture @xmath20-process  @xcite calculations have to rely entirely on theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "however , the performance of such models for reproducing the features of the @xmath0-decay in @xmath20-process waiting - point nuclei has been tested with experimental data only in the two shell - closures at @xmath21 and @xmath22 in measurements such as reported in  @xcite .",
    "the comparison is much more limited in the @xmath6 region , where only half - lives in the neighborhood of the doubly magic @xmath23pb were available ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the neutron - rich nuclei  south \" of @xmath23pb are difficult to measure experimentally because of the very small production cross - sections and the large background conditions induced by the heavy primary beam . in the present work it was possible to produce and identify reliably secondary neutron - rich nuclei in the region",

    "the present measurements were carried out at the gsi helmholtz center for heavy ion research . a @xmath7u beam was accelerated to an energy of 1  gev / u by the unilac linear accelerator coupled to the sis 18 synchrotron .",
    "the average beam intensity was @xmath24  ions / spill , with a pulsed beam structure of 1  s spill duration ( sis extraction ) and a repetition cycle of 4  s. the beam impinged onto a @xmath25be target with a thickness of 1.6  g/@xmath26 at the entrance of the fragment separator ( frs )  @xcite .",
    "the selection of the ions of interest , from this point to the detection system , was done with the @xmath27-method using the frs as an achromatic spectrometer .",
    "neutron - rich nuclei  south - east \" of @xmath23pb in the chart of nuclides were produced using two frs settings centered on @xmath28hg and @xmath29tl . in order to minimize the number of ionic charge states of the secondary beam a niobium layer with a thickness of 223  mg/@xmath26",
    "was placed behind the be - target .",
    "in addition , a homogeneous al degrader with a thickness of 2.5  g/@xmath26 was placed at the first frs focal plane ( s1 ) in combination with thick cu slits , which served to reduce the contribution of fission fragments and primary beam charge - states with initially similar magnetic rigidity ( @xmath30 ) as the setting isotope . a wedge - shaped al degrader with a thickness of 3874  mg/@xmath26 was employed as achromatic degrader at the intermediate focal plane ( s2 ) , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : frsscheme ] ) .",
    "ion species were identified by means of standard frs tracking detectors .",
    "two plastic scintillators located at s2 and at the final focal plane ( s4 ) were used to measure the time - of - flight ( @xmath31 ) of the ions .",
    "two systems of time projection chambers ( tpcs )  @xcite placed at s4 and s2 allowed us to determine accurate @xmath30 values for each ion by measuring their trajectory with respect to the central fragment .",
    "the measured @xmath31 in combination with the @xmath30 provided the necessary information to calculate the mass - to - charge ratio ( a / q ) on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the resolution thus obtained in a / q was 2.5@xmath32  fwhm .    in order to determine the atomic number ( @xmath33 ) , two fast multiple sampling ionization chambers ( musics )  @xcite were placed in the s4 experimental area .",
    "although the detected nuclei were mainly bare , h- and he - like charge states were also detected in musics .",
    "the latter events were corrected by combining the information of the two musics and calculating the energy loss in the s2 degrader following the method applied in previous studies in this mass region  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was needed to treat the gain fluctuations in the music detectors caused by the variations of the temperature in the experimental hall , and consequent changes in gas pressure , which were also corrected numerically  @xcite .",
    "the final resolution obtained in z for the pb - bi region was of @xmath34  fwhm .",

    "simba enabled position and energy measurement of heavy charged ions as well as charged particles from @xmath36 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "the main difference between the simba system employed here with respect to previous versions was the smaller number of si detectors required to stop and implant the ions of the present experiment , which had a higher atomic number ( @xmath37 ) than those measured in the past ( @xmath38 ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the geometry and overall size of simba were also modified in order to optimize neutron detection ( see below ) . the present simba version consisted of a stack of nine highly segmented si detectors ( see figs .  [",

    "the first two layers , called xy - tracking detectors , consisted of single - sided si - strip detectors ( sssd ) with their strips in orthogonal orientation with respect to each other . they were used for determining accurately the ion position in the transversal plane of the beam .",
    "a center - of - gravity method applied to the charge shared over all the strips allowed us to determine the ion position with an accuracy of @xmath39  @xcite , corresponding to one pixel in a silicon layer of simba .",
    "the implant and decay sensitive region consisted of two sssd layers ( front absorbers ) , three double sided silicon stripped detectors ( dsssd ) designated as implantation layers a , b and c , and two sssd layers ( rear absorbers ) .",
    "the energy deposited by the ions along these seven si detectors was used to detect whether the ion was implanted or if it punched through , as well as to determine the corresponding implant layer or depth .",

    "the energy deposited by @xmath0 decays in each si - electrode showed , as expected , a continuum spectrum which extended up to @xmath402 - 3  mev .",
    "the energy deposited in the dsssds was determined from the response of the y - strips , which were readout via logarithmic preamplifiers .",
    "the latter allowed to clearly separate the ion implants and decays in the spectrum ( see table  [ t2-alpha ] and figs .",

    "there are two fundamental aspects in this data analysis , namely a reliable background characterization of @xmath0- and neutron events and the spatial- and temporal- correlation approach .",
    "we describe first the analysis methodology from a rather general perspective and afterwards we show in detail its application to one of the largest implant statistics case , which is @xmath48tl .",
    "the latter is also used to illustrate the background treatment in the analysis .",
    "let us consider one specific isotope @xmath55 .",
    "the bateman analytical expression  @xcite describes the time - evolution of its abundance @xmath56 . in this analysis we assumed that only the parent ( @xmath57 ) and daughter ( @xmath58 ) decays are contributing to the decay curve .",
    "this assumption is justified because all granddaughters of the analyzed nuclei are either stable nuclei or have a half - life much longer than that of parent and daughter nuclei . the resulting expression after this assumption",

    "even the contribution of the daughter nucleus was very small .",

    "did not improve noticeably the statistics and was therefore disregarded . in general , smaller and larger correlation areas were not found to provide a better result in terms of statistics and signal - to - background ratio in the time - correlation diagrams  @xcite .",
    "regarding the time correlation , the methodology followed here consisted of building a correlation histogram for every implant of a certain species @xmath55 containing its time difference with respect to all subsequent @xmath0 events within a broad time window @xmath66 . in this analysis we used ten times the expected half - life , @xmath67 . as it is demonstrated below",

    "the @xmath0 background showed a dependency with the time structure of the pulsed primary beam .",
    "indeed , during beam extraction from sis ( 1  s ) the overall background level of @xmath0-like events in simba was @xmath4040% higher than during the time - interval between spills  @xcite .",
    "this feature led to a better signal - to - background ratio in the implant-@xmath0 time - correlation histograms when only @xmath0-events outside of the spill time - intervals were considered in the correlations , when compared to the same diagram including @xmath0-events inside and outside of the spill . with this restriction in mind ,",
    "the background level evaluation was based on time backward ( @xmath82 ) implant-@xmath0 correlations , i.e. time difference between each implant and all the @xmath0-events occurred before it , within a broad time window ( @xmath83 ) and in the same correlation area used in the forward analysis of 3@xmath843  mm@xmath65 .",

    "half - live values for 20 neutron - rich isotopes of au , hg , tl , pb and bi have been determined experimentally , as well as neutron - branching ratios ( or upper limits ) for eight of them . as some of the analyzed isotopes are not expected to be neutron emitters according their q@xmath50-values ( see the last column of table  [ t5-pn ] ) , due to the low statistics available , the neutron emission analysis has been focused in those with large enough q@xmath50 .",

    "the half - life obtained confirms the recent value published in ref .",
    "@xcite and both differ from the df3+cqrpa value and the trends predicted by the available theoretical models .",
    "whether this  gold anomaly \" is related to effects changing the occupation of the @xmath138 orbital , or due to a weakening of the spin - orbit field caused by the tensor force  @xcite , or might be due to the recently proposed three - body force mechanism  @xcite remains an open question which calls for more detailed theoretical studies and further specific experiments allowing for reconstruction of the decay scheme .    concerning hg isotopes , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , recent measurements at cern - isolde  @xcite indicate that the half - life of @xmath136hg nuclei are much shorter than the values reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and , therefore , this discrepancy will not be discussed further .",
    "theoretical predictions by the frdm+qrpa seem to agree better with the measured half - lives , with the only exception of @xmath121hg , whereas the opposite is found for the hg half - lives predicted with df3+cqrpa .    regarding the thallium isotopes ,",
    "previous half - lives were obtained in another experiment by using a similar experimental setup , but using a completely different analysis approach  @xcite . in summary a good agreement is found for @xmath28tl , whereas the half - lives of @xmath42tl and @xmath48tl differ by factors of 2 - 3 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the overall good agreement for the thallium chain between the present results and frdm+qrpa predictions , including the case of the most exotic nuclei reported here for the first time , @xmath139tl .",
    "this result seems to indicate the rather low relevance of first forbidden ( ff ) transitions in the @xmath140 mass region , as discussed in ref .",

    "the half - life obtained for @xmath29pb is in reasonable agreement with the two previous measurements  @xcite .",
    "along the lead isotopic chain , the frdm+qrpa model overestimates the experimental values by factors between 3 - 9 .",
    "the values predicted by df3+cqrpa are , on average , slightly closer to the measured half - lives , but the mass ( neutron number ) dependency of the half - life is not satisfactorily reproduced by any of these two models .    for the bismuth chain",
    "the frdm+qrpa predictions agree reasonably well with the heaviest measured nuclei @xmath142bi , whereas almost one order of magnitude difference is found for @xmath41bi .",
    "the latter half - life is , however , rather well established experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the result quoted in this work for the half - life of @xmath44bi , 4 - 15  s ( see fig .  [ f4 - 220bi ] ) , can be re - determined more accurately once the half - life of @xmath44po is measured .",
    "the neutron - branching ratios determined in this work represent the first set of experimental data available in this mass region .",
    "therefore , the values reported here can be only compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "both theoretical and experimental @xmath89-values are listed in table  [ t5-pn ] and displayed in fig .",
    "[ f5-pn ] .    in summary , the agreement between theory and experiment is rather good for the hg and tl isotopes with masses between 208 and 214 .",
    "however , for the two heaviest thallium nuclei @xmath101tl , ktuy  @xcite and rhb+rqrpa  @xcite models are in agreement but the other theoretical predictions of the neutron emission overestimate substantially the obtained experimental results .",
    "since both the half - life and the neutron emission probability are integral quantities of the @xmath0-decay , it is difficult to explain why the frdm+qrpa reproduces so well the average decay strength over the full q@xmath16-window ( see fig .  [ f5-resultshl ] ) along the chain of measured tl isotopes , whereas it seems to fail dramatically in the upper energy range of @xmath101tl , beyond the neutron separation energy of the daughter nuclei , as deducted from their determined neutron branching ratios . at first sight ,",
    "one is tempted to attribute such a discrepancy to the possible contribution of high - energy first forbidden ( ff ) transitions populating low - lying levels of the daughter nuclei and hindering therefore the emission of neutrons . nevertheless , this interpretation is at variance with the overall systematic found in the @xmath140 region  @xcite , where gamow - teller ( gt ) transitions seem to play a dominant role in general . at present , the only plausible explanation for such a feature could be that the overall strength of the @xmath0 decay is overestimated in frdm+qrpa both , in the full q@xmath16 and in the upper energy window q@xmath50 . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , more advanced microscopic models such as rhb+rqrpa  @xcite and ktuy  @xcite show an inverted behavior , yielding good predictions for the @xmath89-values , but discrepant values for the half - lives , thus not improving the situation .",
    "recent calculations based on an improved qrpa and hf theory  @xcite , included in fig",
    ".  [ f5-pn ] , also show large discrepancies . clearly more @xmath0-decay measurements and theoretical efforts are needed in this mass region , in order to gain a better understanding of the underlying nuclear structure effects , as well as to guide global theoretical models far - off stability .",
