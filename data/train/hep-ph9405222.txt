    "phase transitions associated with the spontaneous breaking of symmetries in gauge theories are expected to have played a crucial role in the history of the early universe . in particular",
    "they imply the production of topologically stable defects @xcite .",
    "such defects , produced at the energy scale of grand unification , lead to a panoply of cosmological effects .",
    "the most important consequence of their existence , however , is their potential to create energy distribution anisotropies , necessary for seeding the large scale structure of the present universe , and compatible with those observed in the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "different classes of defects lead to distinct cosmological consequences .",
    "the most dramatic is that walls and monopoles are known to come to dominate the energy density of the universe , if inflation does not occur subsequently to their formation or some other mechanism intervenes to enhance their annihilation .",
    "strings by contrast , under certain general conditions , seem to be entirely viable on their own . the fundamental difference arises from the fact that a network of cosmic strings possesses natural mechanisms to reduce its own contribution to the total energy density .",
    "moreover , this is done in a way such that the effective evolution of the energy fraction in strings decreases in time faster than would be expected from the expansion alone and scenarios of string domination are thereby naturally precluded .",
    "the mechanisms that allow for the viable evolution of a string network are essentially motivated on topological grounds and are consequently expected to be model independent @xcite .",
    "they consist of a two step process .",
    "firstly , when two segments of a long string intersect a closed loop of string will be formed .",
    "this happens when the two segments exchange ends after collision , which in turn is a consequence of winding number ( i.e. , vortex topological charge ) conservation on the plane .",
    "this is designated intercommuting .",
    "finally , because closed loops of string are not globally topologically stable they can radiate away the energy trapped in their field configuration as gravitational waves and shrink until they disappear .",
    "the final stage of collapse is probably characterized by vortex annihilation and is expected to produce extremely energetic cosmic rays .",
    "the realization of this scenario rests crucially upon the efficiency of the intercommuting and subsequent string separation .",
    "strings , however are know to experience interactions which depend , in general both on the underlying field theory and on the specific region of its parameter space . in its simplest and most widely used",
    "model strings are the classical non - trivial solutions of the abelian higgs model .",
    "in particular , for certain ratios of coupling constants , they are analogous to the vortex solution in type ii superconductors and to vortices in superfluid @xmath1 .",
    "this latter case corresponds to the vanishing of the gauge sector in the model and the corresponding string solutions are naturally known as global strings .    typically , when estimating how string networks evolve , numerical simulations only invoke the underlying field theory in the initial string formation .",
    "thereafter , they are taken to obey the equations of classical nambu - goto strings , interaction - free but for empirical assumptions about intercommuting . for type ii and global strings these assumptions are buttressed by a number of numerical studies .",
    "they reveal , in particular , that strings indeed exchange ends and separate in these cases .",
    "studies regarding the outcome of collisions of type i strings , which feel an attractive interaction regardless of orientation , are much scarcer @xcite . on the other hand , analytical studies concerning the derivation and generalization of such range of behavior having the field theory as starting point are scarce and tend to concentrate on specific regions of parameter space @xcite . in this paper",
    "we attempt a more general analytic analysis .",
    "the article is organized in two parts .",
    "the longer is concerned with classical vortex interactions .",
    "the first sections essentially review the approximate field solutions for vortices and derive the interaction potential between two vortices or strings , for all values of coupling constant ratios and arbitrary orientations .",
    "models for string production typically lead to initial high string densities .",
    "the latter part of the paper examines the initial stability of string networks , both classically and quantum mechanically .",
    "this part of the paper is rather more speculative .",
    "type i and type ii strings are a consequence of theories that , essentially , undergo either first - order or second - order transitions at the time of string formation .",
    "we make a preliminary attempt to relate this to the nature of string forces .",
    "prior to considering multiple string solutions we briefly review the isolated string field solutions , with particular attention to the field behavior at large distances from their axes of symmetry . although well - known we need the details for later sections .",
    "@xmath0 strings are the extrapolation to three dimensions of the well - known vortex solution of the abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "these are finite energy non - trivial static solutions on the plane .",
    "the lagrangian density takes the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gauge coupling constant to the scalar field , @xmath4 the scalar field self - coupling constant and @xmath5 the vacuum expectation value of the modulus of the scalar field in the broken phase , as usual .",
    "the finiteness of the energy alone determines the asymptotic form of the fields at infinity . in order for the scalar field potential to vanish at infinity",
    ", @xmath6 is constrained to lie on a circle of radius @xmath5 .",
    "its magnitude becomes then well defined but its phase remains arbitrary . on the other hand , the modulus of the covariant derivative must also vanish asymptotically which forces the gauge field to assume the form @xcite @xmath7 this also ensures that the energy contribution arising from the field strength tensor will be finite .",
    "moreover , if we work in polar coordinates , we see that the problem of parameterizing the behavior of the scalar field at infinity reduces to the mapping of a circle , in coordinate space , onto another , in field space .",
    "these mappings , as is well known , fall into an infinite number of homotopy classes , each labeled by an integer @xmath8 .",
    "each solution , characterized by a given @xmath9 , can not in turn , be continuously deformed into another with @xmath10 , without changing the boundary conditions for the fields at infinity . since this would imply expending an infinite amount of energy strings are topologically stable .    even though the above arguments supply us with with some information about vortex solutions the way in which the fields tend to their asymptotic forms is only revealed by studying the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "these can be solved numerically in all detail but , for certain purposes , this does not suffice . such is the case when we want to discuss analytically the detailed energetics of a multiple string field configuration .",
    "exact single solutions exist only for the case of critical coupling ( @xmath11 ) and positive winding number @xcite .",
    "this is a rather special case since the interactions between vortices disappear and the equations of motion for the fields become first order ; the well - known bogomolnyi equations . in general , however , approximate solutions in certain regimes can be derived . in order to show this we take the euler - lagrange equations , assuming cylindrical symmetry , in the radial temporal gauge @xmath12 @xmath13   \\varphi & = & 0 \\\\ \\nabla \\times   \\nabla \\times a_\\theta    +   e \\varphi^2 \\left ( e a_\\theta - { n \\over r } \\right ) & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the modulus of the scalar field and @xmath9 its winding number .",
    "the field @xmath6 is therefore assumed to be of the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angular co - ordinate on the plane . to probe how the fields approach their asymptotic values at infinity , one can expand @xmath14 around @xmath5 as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an auxiliary field .",
    "then the euler - lagrange equations become    @xmath19 -e^2 \\eta q^2   \\\\",

    "equation ( 7 ) shows us how @xmath27 approaches its asymptotic value .",
    "this result allows us to estimate the corresponding behavior for the scalar field . neglecting the quadratic and cubic terms on the fields in ( 5 ) we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 is another constant and @xmath30 the modified bessel function of order 0 . for large arguments the modified bessel functions of order 0 and 1 have the same leading behavior ,",
    "namely , @xmath31    the approximate solutions ( 7 ) and ( 8) when taken in the limit ( 9 ) indeed reproduce the exact asymptotic form of the fields at critical coupling @xcite . as we have seen above",
    ", however , they are valid for all values of the coupling constants in the model .    for short distances , when @xmath32 , equation ( 6 ) becomes essentially that for a free gauge field .",
    "the corresponding form for @xmath27 is then @xmath33    this form is actually compatible with ( 7 ) , when the small argument for the bessel function is assumed .",
    "moreover , if we impose that the magnetic flux should vanish at the origin we will determine @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this is certainly an acceptable procedure for strongly type ii vortices .",
    "an approximate solution for the scalar field close to the origin can equally be found by using ( 10 ) in ( 5 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bessel function of order @xmath9 , which is the usual winding number .",
    "this implies the well - known small distance behavior for @xmath14 @xmath37 in particular for @xmath38 the field is linear close to the origin .",
    "because the behavior of the scalar field in these two quite different limits is not directly relatable , @xmath29 can not be computed with generality . in the rather special case of critical coupling ( @xmath39 ) , however , the dynamical equations for the fields reduce to @xmath40 where @xmath41",
    ". these are the bogomolnyi equations for critically coupled vortices in polar coordinates .",
    "it is easy to see that they allow us to relate @xmath18 and @xmath27 directly and consequently also @xmath29 and @xmath25 . using the identity of the two coupling constants we obtain @xmath42 . in principle",
    "there is no reason for this result to hold in other regions of parameter space other than the good agreement of its consequences with the numerical results , as we shall see later .",
    "nevertheless unless otherwise stated we will assume it henceforth .",
    "we are now in a position to derive the interaction potential between two string segments , under the assumption that the solution for the two string field configuration can be successfully approximated by the superposition ansatz @xcite    @xmath43    here @xmath6 and @xmath44 are the isolated string field configurations of section 1 . in order to estimate the interaction energy between the two vortices one then simply substitutes ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in the energy functional @xmath45 =   \\int dv \\left",

    "this is a second order subleading effect as we shall verify in the next sections .",
    "this whole procedure allows us consequently not only to state the validity of the superposition ansatz for a given functional form of the fields but also to compute the magnitude of the approximation involved .    finally",
    ", the integrations in ( 19 ) or ( 20 ) necessary to obtain the total energy can , in general , also only be performed approximately",
    ". this will be the subject of the two ensuing sections where expressions for the interaction energy are indeed obtained , for all values of @xmath51 and arbitrary orientation of the two string elements .",
    "in this section we derive the integrated expressions for the interaction energy , for all values of @xmath53 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of two parallel strings and leave the study of arbitrary geometries to the next section .",
    "the problem then reduces to the study of two coplanar vortices . because different values of @xmath52 imply quite distinct field configurations we will analyze the cases of critical coupling ( @xmath54 ) , type ii ( @xmath55 ) and type i vortices ( @xmath56 ) separately .      in view of the approximate field solutions obtained in section 1 and the expressions for the interaction energy ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) derived in section 2 ,",
    "this is the simplest case to approach . in general",
    "there are two length scales associated with each vortex .",
    "they are simply the inverse classical masses for the gauge and scalar fields i.e. , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "when the scalar field acquires a non - zero expectation value ( @xmath59 ) both fields become massive and the modified bessel function solutions for the fields constitute a good approximation .",
    "this should happen for distances @xmath60 , measured from the zero of the scalar field , such that @xmath61 .",
    "these approximate solutions tell us how the fields approach their asymptotic values , which in turn correspond to the vacuum of the theory . at distances",
    "@xmath60 larger than @xmath62 a vortex only perturbs the vacuum by effectively acting as a source for the fields @xmath49 and @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction between two vortices , separated by a distance @xmath63 then reduces , in the first approximation , to the interaction between these two fields .",
    "this picture can indeed be obtained from ( 20 ) if we keep only the terms linear on the fields of each vortex .",
    "then we have @xmath64    higher order terms will be much smaller due to the fact that the fields themselves are exponentially decreasing .",

    "this is equally true for a pair of parallel cosmic strings , in agreement with well - known numerical results @xcite .",
    "away from critical coupling the two length scales @xmath62 and @xmath71 become different and the fields are expected to change accordingly . in the specific case",
    "when @xmath72 , @xmath71 will be larger than @xmath62 .",
    "these two lengths now define a set of three coaxial cylinders , around the axis of the string , where the fields may behave in quite a different fashion .",
    "essentially , for distances @xmath60 larger than @xmath71 or smaller than @xmath62 the picture of the last subsection remains qualitatively unchanged .",
    "indeed , for @xmath73 the fields must vary substantially from their values at the origin to a value not too far from their asymptotic forms .",
    "for @xmath74 , on the other hand , the scalar field should be very close to its asymptotic value and consequently will be a slowly varying function of @xmath75 .",
    "then both fields will have acquired their classical masses . for this case",
    "the computations of subsection 4.1 are certainly valid and it follows that two vortices will repel and a pair vortex - antivortex will attract , with magnitude given by ( 26 ) .    the behavior in the intermediate region , however , turns out to be the most interesting .",
    "there @xmath61 and the fields are expected to acquire mass .",
    "this implies , namely , that the modified bessel function form for @xmath49 holds .",
    "however because @xmath76 , the bessel function can be approximated by its small argument behavior @xmath77 when this form is used in the euler - lagrange equation for the scalar field , assuming @xmath78 , we obtain    @xmath79    which is the solution for the global string , in the same regime ( @xmath61)@xcite .",
    "it should now be clear that , as we take @xmath80 , this intermediate region grows to fill all space ( from @xmath81 to infinity ) , and the global string behavior is fully recovered .",
    "this is not very surprising , of course , since in this limit the gauge field decouples from the scalar field and the euler - lagrange equation for the latter is that for the theory exhibiting the global symmetry alone .",
    "what is nevertheless quite interesting is that for an ensemble of type ii local strings to interact as in the global case they simply need to lie at relative distances smaller than @xmath71 .",
    ", in section 1 . ]",
    "let us now see in detail how this picture arises from the previous expressions for the interaction energy .",
    "the part of the energy dependent on @xmath18 can be integrated to give a contribution which falls with at least @xmath82 . because @xmath83 this contribution will be small . on the other hand since the modified bessel function of order 1 is still a solution for the gauge field the computations of subsection 4.1 referring to it will still hold .",
    "we then obtain , keeping the terms on the gauge field only @xmath84 since @xmath85 is small for @xmath86 . however , our assumptions about the nature of the fields leading to ( 29 ) were only valid for @xmath61 , whereas in ( 26 ) we implicitly took it to be applicable in all space between the origins of each vortex .",
    "we must , therefore subtract the energy corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "we then get @xmath87 this expression is just what we would expect for the global string , c.f .",
    "@xcite , and ensures the consistency of the arguments above . as is well known this results in a strong , infinite range , @xmath88 provides the natural cutoff at large @xmath75 ] , repulsive ( attractive ) force for a pair vortex - vortex ( vortex - antivortex ) .      in the preceding analysis we were able to compute estimates for the interaction energy between vortices under a few quite general assumptions .",
    "in particular we learned that the proximity of the scalar field to its asymptotic value ( traduced in the criterion @xmath61 ) introduced a fundamental qualitative change in the behavior of the fields , allowing us to use the approximate solutions ( 7 ) and ( 8) with some confidence .",
    "the case of type i vortices is naturally characterized by the fact that @xmath91 .",
    "the results for @xmath54 for the interaction between two vortices should in particular still be valid as long as their scalar cores do not overlap , i.e. for ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "then , unlike what happened when @xmath55 , and because now @xmath92 the scalar field contribution will dominate the energy .",
    "moreover , since the corresponding term in the interaction energy ( 26 ) has no dependence on the sign of the winding numbers this will always result on an attractive force regardless of the actual nature of the two vortices involved .",
    "as may easily be anticipated we will run into a problem when we try to estimate what happens in the intermediate region ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this can be explicitly shown if we search for the behavior of the fields of a single vortex in this region of space .",
    "in fact , the way we derived the bessel function behavior of @xmath49 for large distances was to assume that @xmath14 would be close to @xmath5 , so that the mass term in ( 6 ) would clearly be the dominant one . this always holds provided that @xmath94 , and is thus certainly a good approximation for the cases above .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath60 is small enough so that @xmath95 , and @xmath49 exhibits its short distance behavior , then the solution of ( 3 ) becomes @xmath96    but this is the behavior we expect for the scalar field very close to the origin , independently of any particular value of the coupling constants .",
    "however , we also note that as we progress towards @xmath81 , @xmath18 approaches @xmath5 and the bessel function behavior ( 7 ) , and ( 8) start being valid for @xmath49 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "when this happens , @xmath49 automatically assumes an exponentially decreasing form since @xmath85 is large but @xmath18 should still behave approximately logarithmically since @xmath97 is small .",
    "this should happen in a region where the distance to the string s axis is sufficiently close to @xmath62 .",
    "consequently and unlike what happened for type ii strings this approximate behavior for the fields can only exist for a thin region of space around a string .",
    "its consequences for the interaction energy between the two strings will then only constitute a transient regime between its form for large distances and the actual superposition of the two vortices .",
    "nevertheless we can compute what the corresponding interaction energy should be . proceeding in the same way as in 4.2 , but now only keeping the contribution from the scalar field we obtain @xmath98 where ,",
    "again , we implicitly assumed that this regime was present in the whole region between the two axes .",
    "we should then remove the contribution from the inner region where this does not apply . in the absence of another length scale",
    "we can only subtract the energy arising from @xmath86 .",
    "this however will result in an overestimate ( in absolute value ) for the final result .",
    "we then obtain @xmath99 this always gives rise to an attractive force , as expected .    at distances smaller than @xmath62",
    ", the scalar cores of the two strings will superimpose .",
    "this results in a field configuration of winding number @xmath100 as the distance between the zeros of the scalar fields vanishes .",
    "such a transformation of the two string field configuration is accompanied by the change in behavior between the modified and unmodified bessel functions solution for the scalar field of section 1 .",
    "this change is dictated by the nonlinearities in the corresponding euler - lagrange equations which implies the breakdown of the superposition ansatz .",
    "close to @xmath101 , however it is known numerically @xcite that the interaction energy should become approximately constant , signalling the fact that a type i string of higher winding number is a _",
    "stable _ solution of the euler - lagrange equations relative to its lower winding number isolated constituents .",
    "[ alternatively , type ii strings of higher winding number are unstable with respect to decay into strings of lower winding number ] .",
    "in the previous section we analyzed how the value of the ratio of the two coupling constants in the model @xmath52 changes the field configurations and derived the interaction energy between two vortices , i.e. between a pair of parallel strings , per unit length .",
    "for a general network of cosmic strings we know@xcite that strings wiggle and bend , possibly on several scales , and , in general , no two strings are parallel .",
    "we shall expand upon this in the next section .",
    "the assumption of parallel strings , however , conveniently allowed us some comfortable simplifications . because each string is locally ( i.e. for any element of infinitesimal length along its axis )",
    "cylindrically symmetric we could associate the natural frame for the second string with that for the first simply by translating it by a distance @xmath102 , within the same plane .",
    "this distance was then automatically defined for all pairs of string elements and the interaction energy for a piece of string due to the presence of the second is simply that for one element times the length . for a general configuration of the two strings both the distance and orientation have to be specified for each pair of elements .",
    "they will therefore weigh differently in the evaluation of the interaction energy between two pieces of string of finite length .    because of the cylindrical symmetry of the fields composing a string is still locally preserved , to find the interaction energy of one of its elements we need only look for an element of a second string intersecting the plane in which it lies .",
    "the natural frame for the element of the second string will appear in the general case to have its origin at a distance @xmath102 but also to have been rotated so that it no longer lies in the plane of the former .",
    "however , because of its own local cylindrical symmetry , rotations around its axis of symmetry leave it unchanged .",
    "this rotation relative to the plane of the first vortex is then generated by two angles only .",
    "this can be seen in figure 1 , where we chose the x - axis along the direction connecting the origins of the two vortices .",
    "the angles @xmath103 and @xmath104 parameterize rotations around the @xmath105 and @xmath106-axes , respectively .    in order to be able to generalize the results of section 3",
    "we must be able to understand how the change in orientation of the two relative elements affects the interaction energy .",
    "this will result essentially in a change on the inner products between the unit vectors for the directions associated with the natural frame of each string .",
    "this change can be computed by rotating one of the frames around the x and y - axes of figure 1 .",
    "we now see , in particular , that @xmath65 will simply have the form @xmath107 this allow us to integrate the two terms in ( 23 ) to obtain @xmath108   - \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\left [ \\int ds   n_1 n_2 \\left ( \\nabla_{r_1 } k_0(m_a r_2 ) \\nabla_{r_1 } k_0 ( m_a r_1 )",

    "these two terms do not cancel in general . rewriting ( 35 )",

    "the residual contribution in the integral effectively goes to zero with the sine squared of the angles , in agreement with the results of section 3 .",
    "expression ( 38 ) stresses the quite different nature of the two contributions to the interaction energy .",
    "the vector - like character of the gauge field introduces a dependence on the relative orientation between the two strings .",
    "in particular we see that if one of the strings is rotated by @xmath113 the corresponding interaction energy term changes sign .",
    "this is equivalent to changing the nature of a vortex into an anti - vortex or vice - versa and results from the geometric nature of the winding number .",
    "the term arising from the scalar field is , in contrast , insensitive to any particular configuration for the two - string system , as could naturally be anticipated .",
    "it also becomes clear that critical coupling ( @xmath54 ) , for an arbitrary geometric configuration , ceases to be the special case when the interactions between strings vanish since the angular dependence on @xmath103 and @xmath104 destroys the balance between the gauge and scalar terms in the energy .",
    "all expressions derived above concern elements of string with infinitesimal length , resulting from the integration of the interaction energy functional on the plane . to obtain",
    "the interaction energy for two segments of string of finite length one then has to integrate over a series of planes perpendicular to one of the strings . in particular , every time the string bends so that any of its elements will lie at an angle larger than @xmath114 it is expected to experience self - interactions .",
    "this is always the case for closed loops of string which contain part of the energy arising from self - interactions , in addition to their tension .",
    "the expressions derived above allow us to compute analytically the interactions for a variety of configurations .",
    "let us consider two simple examples .    for a circular loop of large enough diameter @xmath115 ( @xmath116 as always )",
    "it is straightforward to compute its self - energy .",
    "it is simply @xmath117 where @xmath118 is given by expression ( 26 ) , taken in the appropriate limit , for a parallel pair of string - antistring ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "another interesting case is to compute the interaction energy due to a circular loop of string , in the limit when the distance to a test string segment is much larger than the loop s diameter .",
    "then , see figure 2 , the interactions are essentially due to a dipole of string segments .",
    "the corresponding interaction energy is proportional to the sum of the bessel functions coming from the gauge and scalar field contributions .",
    "in particular for the contribution from the former we will have @xmath120 where @xmath121 now , in the limit of small diameter compared to distance @xmath122 and for the strong type ii small loops of string , when @xmath123 , we can series expand the bessel function to obtain @xmath124 - \\nonumber \\\\ & - & md \\left [ \\cos(\\theta)- { d \\over r }   \\sin^2(\\theta ) k_1(mr)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the energy can then approximately be written as @xmath125 k_1(mr ) - m^2 d^2 \\cos^2 ( \\theta ) k_0(mr ) \\right).\\ ] ] this expression has two different limits depending on the relative value of @xmath88 and @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath126 is large then we can take the asymptotic forms for the bessel functions at large arguments ( 9 ) to obtain @xmath127 if , on the other hand , @xmath128 ( extremely type ii case ) , we can use the form of the bessel functions for small arguments to obtain @xmath129.\\ ] ] we see in particular that in this latter case the leading order term in ( 45 ) coincides with the usual @xmath130 potential for a point - like field source in 3 dimensions .",
    "a small loop of ( quasi)global string thus behaves effectively as a monopole when seen at sufficiently large distances .",
    "in simulations of string production ( e.g. , see @xcite ) @xmath6 field phases are laid down at random in a space divided into correlation volumes within which the @xmath6 field phase is held approximately constant . in these circumstances strings with winding number @xmath131 are produced at high density .",
    "the laboratory production @xcite of string defects in superfluid @xmath1 has suggested that this model is plausible @xcite , at least for the non - relativistic vortices of the global @xmath0 ginzberg - landau theory .",
    "in addition to the role string interactions have in determining the outcome of string collisions they may affect the early string evolution if , as expected , strings are produced at sufficiently high density . in the remainder of this paper we shall examine the effect of interstring forces in a newly created , and approximately static , ensemble of strings . in this section",
    "we shall investigate whether , with only attractive forces , type i strings can exist at high density .",
    "this is not a question of how two strings of lower winding number combine to form a string with higher winding number , since we expect strings , of whatever type , to appear as a tangled mess .",
    "however , we shall return to this point later . to see how type i strings could exist we adopt a classical toy model possessing some of the characteristics of real strings , in which the effect of attractive forces is more transparent .",
    "cosmic strings are produced at phase transitions in the g.u.t .",
    "era but , nominally independently of this , it is known that thermodynamic ensembles of classical string naturally display transitions .",
    "most naively , if cosmic strings are treated as non - interacting nambu - goto strings with modes of arbitrarily high frequency they undergo a hagedorn transition @xcite.in this section we take this classical transition seriously , but we shall be more realistic by treating classical strings more as polymers . these again show transitions but , unlike the fundamental nambu - goto strings , permit the inclusion of string forces at low densities .    the comments that follow",
    "are a straightforward extension of earlier work of ours on global strings @xcite . since they are somewhat speculative a detailed recreation of these earlier results is inappropriate , and the reader is referred to the literature .",
    "strings produced in the way indicated above behave like random walks of high density @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that an ensemble of non - interacting random walks at temperature @xmath132 , step length @xmath133 , can be described by a dual field theory of a free complex field @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "the `` loop field '' @xmath134 has action ( hamiltonian ) @xcite @xmath135,\\ ] ] where @xmath136    in which @xmath137 is the string energy / unit length and @xmath138 is the entropy / unit length .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath139 at @xmath140 defines a hagedorn transition at @xmath141 , at which string is produced copiously .",
    "for @xmath142 the theory is unstable .",
    "this is already enough to indicate why , even if the string formation mechanism naturally generated strings with higher winding number @xmath143 , the thermal energy would be sufficient to unpeel them to @xmath131 strings .",
    "the problem is akin to that of adhesion in macromolecules . as a first step we adopt the simplifying assumption that , once separated from a string of higher winding number , @xmath131 strings experience no forces .",
    "a straightforward extension @xcite of the work of wiegel @xcite shows that , provided the energy required to split an @xmath144 string into two @xmath38 strings is less than the cost of creating the string , the hagedorn transition survives at the same temperature @xmath145 .",
    "moreover , there is a temperature range @xmath146 in which the separation into @xmath38 strings is total .",
    "we shall not consider the problem of higher winding number further .",
    "the forces between the strings modify ( 46 ) .",
    "orientable forces are characterized by a dual vector field @xmath147 .",
    "it is not possible to mimic our cosmic strings exactly .",
    "however , for a strong type ii theory of static strings at low density , a plausible dual field theory is given by an action @xcite    @xmath148,\\ ] ]    where @xmath149 , and @xmath150 is the dimensionless coupling strength .",
    "@xmath139 is as before .    by the same token ,",
    "the extension of @xmath151 to include a scalar field @xmath152 , as in the action    @xmath153,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    corresponds to the inclusion of non - orientable sources and hence the possibility of type i strings .",
    "the coupling @xmath154 characterizes the attractive nature of these forces .",
    "the simple diagonal form ( in terms of @xmath152 and @xmath155 ) can not fully reproduce the results of ( 38 ) .",
    "however , it does indicate how attractive forces of finite range are permissible at low density .",
    "to see this , we note that , in the dual theory of ( 46 ) , ( 48 ) or ( 49 ) , the dimensionful string density @xmath156 , the length / unit volume , is given by @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "we see from ( 49 ) that , because of the attractive forces , the classical @xmath152-field sector is unstable unless @xmath158 , i.e. , unless the string density is sufficiently low .",
    "we note that long - range wholly - attractive forces would always lead to ( classical ) instability in this simple model .",
    "however , the result that finite range attractive forces do not destabilize the network at low enough density ( large enough separation ) seems very plausible .",
    "further , insofar as @xmath159 increases as the strings become more strongly type i , the maximum permissible density drops , given the constancy of @xmath160 .    to do better",
    "would require a greater confidence in ( 47 ) that we can expect .",
    "however , a one - loop approximation to the effective density potential in which the @xmath155 and @xmath152 fields are integrated over in ( 49 ) gives    @xmath161    @xmath162 of ( 50 ) is sufficient to show why , when arbitrary string orientations are taken into account , there is nothing special about the value @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath52 near unity , when @xmath163 and ( presumably ) @xmath164 , the effect of the attractive non - orientable third term is to partially , but not wholly , cancel the effect of the orientable force term at low density .",
    "this is as we would expect .    for strong type",
    "i strings the situation is totally unclear , and there is no natural way to identify type i and type ii strings with first - order ( melting ) and second - order ( hagedorn ) transitions , directly .",
    "it could be argued that neither should there be , since whether a string is type - i or type - ii has more to say about the nature of the quantum field phase transition than classical transitions .",
    "it is to the quantum aspects of string production that we now turn .",
    "the main reason for halting our analysis of the dual theory is not so much its incompleteness as the fact that , initially , cosmic string production arises from quantum fluctuations at the phase transition possessed by the underlying local @xmath0 field theory . without reference to string ,",
    "in approximate thermal equilibrium , the theory displays a second - order transition at the temperature @xmath165 if @xmath166 . on the other hand , for @xmath167",
    "it is reliably expected to display a first - order transition .",
    "this accords with our terminology of type ii and type i strings , respectively .",
    "however , there is no reason to believe that the transition changes from second to first order exactly at @xmath54 .    whatever the case , in quantum field theory there can not be a hagedorn transition , with its characteristic maximum temperature .",
    "rather , there is a critical temperature @xmath168 above which the @xmath0 symmetry is restored and strings can not occur . in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath169 , this is best seen by working in euclidean time , in which the fields are periodic with period @xmath170 .",
    "provided @xmath169 is larger than the mass scales the heavy ( @xmath171 ) modes in the fourier series can be integrated out , to give an effective three - dimensional theory derived from ( 1 ) , with action @xcite @xmath172 \\nonumber \\\\ & + &   { \\rm terms\\   containing\\   a_0(\\underline x)\\ + \\ counterterms},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath173 is the temporal component of the `` light '' ( @xmath174 ) mode component of the gauge-@xmath175 field , and    @xmath176    is the effective scalar mass of the theory .",
    "there are two points to note about the action ( 51 ) .",
    "firstly , when @xmath177 , it is extremised by the same ( static ) vortex solutions as was the action based upon ( 1 ) , but for the fact that the higgs mass is temperature dependent .",
    "the second is that the higgs potential in ( 51 ) shows a second - order transition , prior to integrating over the gauge field @xmath178 , whatever the value of @xmath52 .",
    "a first order transition can only occur for @xmath167 as a consequence of gauge - field radiative corrections .",
    "returning to the first point , we could use the classical solutions to ( 51 ) as the basis of a dual field theory , as in the previous section .",
    "this would now be a dual theory in the more usual sense of the word , a rewriting of the original quantum theory in terms of its excitations .",
    "the instability of this theory is , in the first instance , characterized again by the vanishing of @xmath179 except that @xmath137 and @xmath133 , the step length , are now expressed in terms of @xmath180 . with @xmath181 and @xmath182 the condition @xmath183 becomes @xmath184 @xcite , or @xmath185 this is the ginzberg criterion for the onset of large fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath168 , at which ( 51 ) becomes an unreliable basis for calculation .",
    "thus , the hagedorn transition of the previous section becomes subsumed in the conventional phase transition for the quantum field and the classical and quantum pictures are reconciled .",
    "our comments on attractive forces enforcing a maximum density if they are not to lead to unstabilities also survives .",
    "moreover , although @xmath186 diminishes towards the transition , so does the scalar dual field coupling strength @xmath159 , which we assume to be @xmath187 .",
    "thus the maximum density does not diminish in the way we might have expected from the classical picture .",
    "nonetheless , given that the string density is so high in the naive kibble mechanism @xcite , it is always possible that this bound is breached . for type",
    "i strings another possibility exists . a first order transition is characterised by the production of latent heat .",
    "in the context of dual string theory it will be manifest as a first order transition in the string density @xmath188 .",
    "a naive model for dislocation melting in solids has been based upon action @xmath151 , treated as a quantum theory ( @xmath189 ) @xcite .",
    "since melting is , by definition , first - order , the quantum fluctuations of the @xmath155-field in ( 48 ) can indeed induce a first - order transition in the order parameter @xmath188 if the coupling @xmath190 of the orientable forces is strong enough .",
    "the inclusion of non - orientable forces clouds the issue .",
    "such a transition is extremely difficult to predict , requiring an analysis of the dual theory beyond the mean - field approximation hinted at earlier .",
    "calculations have been performed @xcite that extend the work of @xcite to include the temperature dependence of the mass @xmath180 and the coupling strength @xmath18 for strings ( extreme type ii ) with short - range orientable forces .",
    "they show that , should a first - order transition occur , it too will be buried in the ginzberg temperature range .",
    "the effect of this is that the string density can be very much lower ( e.g. a factor @xmath191 ) than we would have had otherwise .",
    "such a low density is unlikely to have any problems for stability .    as a final comment",
    ", it might be argued that the use of static networks , even initially , is inappropriate .",
    "however , the difference between an ensemble of static strings and an ensemble of relativistic strings , while present , is not as much as might be thought .",
    "for example , relativistic nambu - goto loops are described in terms of right - moving and left - moving modes .",
    "this doubling of modes changes the power behaviour of the prefactor to the hagedorn exponential in the counting of states , in comparison to a static ensemble .",
    "however , this change is exactly cancelled by integrating over the loop centre - of - mass momenta , which effectively makes their centres of mass static . in the same sense , the time - independent action ( 51 ) , if used as a basis for string saddlepoints , would give rise to zero - frequency modes that could be interpreted as centre - of - mass loop dynamics .    of course",
    ", we have been very simplistic in our neglect of quantum fluctuations about the strings .",
    "this has been considered elsewhere ( last reference , @xcite ) and does not derail our conclusions to date .",
    "however , it does compound our inability to be quantitative with the dual theory .",
    "we have shown how the interaction energy for @xmath0 cosmic strings depends on the parameter space of the model as well as on the relative orientations of two interacting strings .",
    "one of the crucial assumptions in all simulations of the evolution of networks of cosmic strings is that they intercommute in all cases .",
    "this property , however , should depend both on the topology of the problem which ensures the exchange of ends of the two strings and is model independent , but also on the dynamics of the system under the effect of its interactions .",
    "our analysis reveals that type i strings experience attractive and , in the limit where the contribution from the gauge sector is negligible , non - orientable interactions .",
    "this is corroborated by several numerical studies and implies that in the absence of a strong effect at the superposition of their scalar cores two such strings will form a bound state of higher winding number , at a sufficiently low energy collision and for small relative angles .",
    "such higher winding number states are well - known to be stable .",
    "a more detailed study concerning this problem is presented elsewhere @xcite , where we attempt to quantify the circumstances in which such configurations may occur .",
    "type i strings are especially interesting for scenarios of thermal string production after a period of inflation , since the critical temperature associated with the phase transition is lowered by taking @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "if the intercommuting of type i strings could be shown to be very inefficient such scenarios would have to be ruled out on the grounds of being cosmologically unacceptable .",
    "the most likely effect of the interactions , however , would probably be that of modifying the evolution parameters of a network of strings to some extent without jeopardizing the approach to a scaling regime @xcite .",
    "type ii , global and critically coupled strings in our picture would intercommute .",
    "this is absolutely consistent with several numerical studies@xcite .",
    "finally the knowledge of explicit forms for the interaction energy of strings is a crucial element for the construction of a realistic statistical description of strings , as well as of vortices away from critical coupling . in the last sections we have indicated , through the methods of a dual field theory",
    ", how strings with attractive forces do not destabilize the initial string network once the density becomes low enough .",
    "observed originally for classical strings , it follows equally for strings produced by equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "further , we see why @xmath54 ceases to be critical once arbitrary string orientations are taken into account .",
    "of course , strings produced by fluctuations have to be frozen in by subsequent out - of - equilibrium development , and this has been omitted from our discussion .",
    "the whole mechanism of string production from a quantum theory , both with and without initial approximate thermal equilibrium , is considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the mechanisms proposed by kibble @xcite for string production from fluctuations , from which we have been quoting , seem substantially correct .",
