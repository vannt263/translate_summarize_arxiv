    "a molecular interaction network within a cell may be decomposed into elementary biochemical reactions , such as @xmath0 where the @xmath1 are distinct chemical species .",
    "( this stoichiometry is unlikely but helpful for illustrative purposes . ) under mass - action kinetics , the rate of such a reaction is proportional to the concentrations of the substrates , taking stoichiometry into account .",
    "hence , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the concentration of species @xmath1 , @xmath4 $ ] , and @xmath5 is the positive mass - action rate constant . in a biochemical network , reactions contribute production and consumption terms consisting of monomials like @xmath6 to the rates of formation of the species in the network .",
    "this results in a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , @xmath7 , in which each component rate function @xmath8 is a polynomial in the state variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive rate constants .",
    "the nonlinearities in * ( [ e - mon ] ) * usually preclude mathematical analysis of the dynamical behaviour of such ode systems , which are customarily studied by numerical simulation .",
    "this requires that the rate constants be given numerical values , which in most cases are neither known nor readily measurable .",
    "the resulting `` parameter problem '' remains a major difficulty in exploiting mathematical models , @xcite .",
    "however , the steady states of such odes are zeros of a set of polynomial equations , @xmath11 .",
    "computational algebra and algebraic geometry provide powerful tools for studying these solutions , @xcite , and these have recently been used to gain new biological insights , @xcite .",
    "the rate constants can now be treated as symbolic parameters , whose numerical values do not need to be known in advance . the capability to rise above the parameter problem allows more general results to be obtained than can be expected from numerical simulation , @xcite .",
    "the focus on steady states , rather than transient dynamics , is still of substantial interest .",
    "for instance , in time - scale separation , which has been a widespread method of simplification in biochemistry and molecular biology , a fast sub - system is assumed to be at steady state with respect to a slower environment and steady - state analysis is used to eliminate the internal complexity in the sub - system , @xcite .",
    "approximate or quasi - steady states have also been shown to exist under various cellular conditions and can now be engineered _ in vivo _ , @xcite .",
    "finally , steady states provide the skeleton around which the transient dynamics unfolds , so knowledge of the former can be helpful for understanding the latter .",
    "the present paper focusses on the algebraic concept of an `` invariant '' : a polynomial expression on selected state variables that is zero in any steady state , with the coefficients of the expression being rational expressions in the symbolic rate constants , @xcite . recall that a rational expression is a quotient of two polynomials ; an example of such being the classical michaelis - menten constant of an enzyme , @xcite .",
    "( a more general definition of an invariant allows the coefficients to include conserved quantities , @xcite , but this extension is not discussed here . )",
    "since each of the rate functions , @xmath8 , is zero in any steady state , the force of the definition comes from the restriction to `` selected state variables '' .",
    "it is possible that , by performing appropriate algebraic operations on @xmath12 , non - selected variables can be eliminated , leaving a polynomial expression on only the selected variables that must be zero in any steady state .",
    "invariants turn out to be surprisingly useful .",
    "they have been shown to characterise the biochemical networks underlying multisite protein phosphorylation , @xcite , suggesting that different network architectures can be identified through experimental measurements at steady state .",
    "if an invariant has only a single selected variable that appears linearly , this variable has the same value in any steady state since it is determined solely by the rate constants .",
    "in particular , its value is unaffected by changes to the initial conditions or to the total amounts of any species .",
    "this is `` absolute concentration robustness '' ( acr ) , as introduced in @xcite , which accounts for experimental findings in some bacterial bifunctional enzymes , @xcite . the mammalian bifunctional enzyme , 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase / fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase ( pfk-2/fbpase-2 ) , which has a more complex enzymatic network , also yields invariants , with implications for regulation of glycolysis , @xcite .",
    "the methods developed here provide a systematic way to analyse such bifunctional enzymes , as explained below .",
    "computational algebra exploits the method of grbner bases to provide an elimination theorem , @xcite , that permits variables to be systematically eliminated among the rate equations , @xmath12 , @xcite .",
    "algorithms for calculating grbner bases are available in general - purpose tools like mathematica , matlab and maple and in specialised mathematical packages such as singular and macaulay2",
    ". however , these algorithms are computationally expensive for the task at hand .",
    "they have been developed for general sets of polynomials and have not been optimised for those coming from biochemical networks .",
    "for instance , mathematica s grbner basis algorithm does not terminate on the network for pfk-2/fbpase-2 .",
    "if invariants are to be exploited further , alternative approaches are needed .",
    "the nonlinearity in mass action comes from the pattern of substrate stoichiometry in * ( [ e - reac ] ) * , which gives rise to the monomial nonlinearity in * ( [ e - mon])*. in the language of chemical reaction network theory ( crnt ) , the patterns of stoichiometry that appear on either side of a reaction arrow are called `` complexes '' , @xcite . reaction * ( [ e - reac ] ) * has three species , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and two complexes , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "* and see below ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility of using fast linear methods , in preference to slow polynomial algorithms , to construct a subset of invariants : those that are symbolic linear combinations of the complex monomials , @xmath20 .",
    "as before , this definition acquires substance by restricting the complexes that can appear .",
    "if @xmath22 are the selected complexes , then a complex - linear invariant is a polynomial expression of the form @xmath23 , that is zero in any steady state , where @xmath24 may be rational expressions in the symbolic rate constants .    in this paper",
    ", we examine a large class of complex - linear invariants that we call `` type 1 '' .",
    "we determine the dimension of the space of type 1 invariants ( proposition  [ t - dim ] ) and provide a linear algorithm for calculating them ( theorem  [ t - inv ] ) .",
    "we point out how invariants can be used in proving previous results of horn and jackson , @xcite , and the shinar - feinberg theorem for acr , @xcite .",
    "we then apply the method to contrast two examples of enzymatic bifunctionality , the bacterial envz / ompr osmolarity regulator and the mammalian pfk-2/fbpase-2 glycolytic regulator .",
    "the method is sufficiently straightforward that the invariants for networks of this kind can be found by manual inspection of an appropriate matrix .",
    "finally , we outline a systematic procedure for analysing any network using type 1 complex - linear invariants .",
    "an appendix contains supplementary information .",
    "it is assumed that there are @xmath25 species , @xmath26 , whose concentrations are @xmath27 , respectively , and @xmath28 complexes , @xmath29 .",
    "complexes are regarded formally as multisets of species , @xmath30 , where the value of the multiset , @xmath31 , on the species @xmath32 , denoted @xmath33 is the stoichiometry of @xmath32 in @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath34 . the reactions in the network define a directed graph on the complexes , with an edge @xmath35 whenever there is a reaction with substrate stoichiometry given by @xmath31 and product stoichiometry given by @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding mass - action rate constant gives each edge a label , @xmath37 , treated as a positive symbol , @xmath38 .",
    "any directed graph , @xmath39 , with labels in @xmath40 gives rise to an abstract dynamics in which each edge is treated as if it were a first - order chemical reaction with its label as rate constant . since the rates are all first - order , the dynamics are linear and may therefore be written in matrix terms as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a column vector , consisting of an abstract concentration @xmath43 at each node @xmath44 of @xmath39 , and @xmath45 is a @xmath46 matrix called the laplacian matrix of @xmath39 . here , `` .

    "the graph laplacian has wide application in biology , as described in @xcite , where additional information may be found .    in crnt ,",
    "the laplacian , @xmath47 , provides a linear analogue for complexes of the nonlinear function , @xmath48 , for species , in the following sense .",

    ", it is particularly useful to know the kernel of @xmath45 : @xmath58 .",
    "this was first determined by feinberg and horn , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) , by a non - constructive method . here",
    ", we briefly describe the constructive method introduced in @xcite , which shows how @xmath59 can be algorithmically calculated from @xmath39 .",
    "this can be done in two stages , @xcite .",
    "first , if @xmath39 is `` strongly connected '' , so that any two distinct nodes are linked by a contiguous series of edges in the same direction , then @xmath60 .",
    "the matrix - tree theorem provides an explicit construction of a basis element , @xmath61 , in terms of the spanning trees of @xmath39 : @xmath62 .",
    "the components @xmath63 are polynomials in the symbolic labels but the details of their calculation are not needed here . if @xmath39 is not strongly connected , it can be partitioned into its maximal strongly - connected sub - graphs , or `` strongly connected components '' ( sccs ) .",
    "these inherit from @xmath39 a directed graph structure , @xmath64 , in which there is an edge in @xmath64 from scc @xmath65 to scc @xmath66 whenever there is an edge in @xmath39 from some node in @xmath65 to some node in @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath64 can not have any directed cycles and so always has terminal sccs , with no edges leaving them .",
    "let these be @xmath67 . for each @xmath68 ,",
    "let @xmath69 be the vector which , for vertices of @xmath39 that lie in @xmath70 , agrees with the vector @xmath71 , coming from the matrix - tree theorem applied to @xmath70 as an isolated graph , and , for all other vertices , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "then , the @xmath74 form a basis for @xmath59 : @xmath75 this gives algebraic expressions for the components of the basis vectors as polynomials in the symbolic labels . note that @xmath74 may be very sparse , being non - zero only for vertices in the single scc @xmath70 .",
    "depending on the application , invariants may be required that involve only certain complexes , @xmath76 , for instance , those involving species with more easily measurable concentrations .",
    "since the indices can be permuted so that the complexes of interest appear first in the ordering , it can be assumed that invariants are sought on @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the @xmath78 matrix representing the linear part of the crnt decomposition , @xmath79 .",
    "a simple way to construct a complex - linear invariant on @xmath22 is to find a vector , @xmath80 , such that , if @xmath81 is @xmath82 extended with @xmath83 zeros , @xmath84 , then @xmath85 is in the rowspan of @xmath77 .",
    "that is , it is a linear combination of the rows of @xmath77 . if @xmath56 is any steady state of the system , so that @xmath57 , then @xmath86 because @xmath87 . since @xmath85 is in the rowspan of @xmath77 , @xmath88 .",

    "we focus here only on those invariants , @xmath23 , in which @xmath85 is in the rowspan of @xmath77 .",
    "we call these type 1 complex - linear invariants .",
    "non - type 1 invariants do exist , as we show in the supporting information ( si ) .",
    "the type 1 invariants form a vector space that we abbreviate @xmath96 ; note that @xmath96 depends on @xmath22 and not just on @xmath97 .",
    "two basic problems are , first , to determine the dimension of @xmath96 and , second , to generate its elements .",
    "a simple solution to the second problem is to break the matrix @xmath77 into the @xmath98 sub - matrix @xmath99 consisting of the first @xmath97 columns of @xmath77 and the @xmath100 sub - matrix @xmath101 consisting of the remaining @xmath83 columns , so that @xmath102 .",

    "invariants may provide a way to study it : perhaps certain invariants can be shown to remain `` invariant '' when a network is enlarged in a particular way .",
    "second , a theme is emerging from the examples considered here . despite the differences in network structures between figures  [ f-1 ] , [ f-2 ] and [ f-4 ] , the bifunctionality in each case serves to limit the steady state concentration of a substrate form , either absolutely , as in figure  [ f-1 ] , or relative to some robust upper bound , as in figures  [ f-2 ] and [ f-4 ] .",
    "we speculate that this may be a design principle of those bifunctional enzymes that catalyse forward and reverse modifications .",
    "there are other forms of bifunctionality , such as enzymes that catalyse successive steps in a metabolic pathway , and preliminary studies suggest that these behave very differently . if modification bifunctionality did evolve to implement concentration control , markedly different network structures seem to have converged upon it .    ,",
