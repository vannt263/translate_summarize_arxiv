    "supernova 2011fe was discovered soon after explosion in the nearby galaxy m101 ( ngc  5457 ) by the palomar transient factory @xcite on 2011 august 24.167 ut ( all calendar dates herein are ut ) and rapidly classified as a supernova of type ia ( sn ia ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* identified initially as ptf11kly ) .",
    "this was the brightest sn ia since sn  1972e in ngc  5253 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , although sn  1986 g remains the nearest sn  ia ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the combination of proximity , early discovery , and modern observing resources makes this sn a rare gift that can be studied in unprecedented detail .    over the last two decades , the reliability of sne  ia as calibratable standard candles has been securely established .",
    "specifically , the regression of peak brightness in optical magnitudes ( corrected for reddening and _ a priori _ second parameter effects , usually light - curve shape ) against recession velocity @xmath3 ( the hubble diagram ) in the range @xmath4 has been shown to be almost linear and to have a scatter of only 0.13 mag rms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sne  ia are thus largely free of any malmquist bias , and by virtue of their brightness , are cosmological probes at distances where peculiar motions of galaxies are insignificant compared to the expansion velocity of the cosmic manifold .",
    "their consequent use as probes of cosmic acceleration is now well known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "photometry of sne  ia in the near infra - red ( nir ) has shown even greater promise for use as a standard candle ( for a recent review of the nir properties of sne  ia , see @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of extinction are greatly reduced and they appear to have relatively constant peak magnitudes in @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the scatter in the nir hubble diagram is @xmath7 mag _ without _ the light - curve shape corrections necessary for optical bands @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , we began a director s discretionary time program to observe sn  2011fe with the wiyn high - resolution infrared camera ( whirc ) nir camera at the wiyn 3.5-m telescope on kitt peak , taking advantage of the instrumentation deployment that allows for the use of the nir camera even when other instruments are scheduled for a given night .",
    "we imaged the sn on 34 nights between 2011 aug 27 and 2011 oct 26 with whirc .",
    "the whirc camera @xcite contains a 2048@xmath8 hgcdte array with a field of view of 33 x 33 and a pixel scale of @xmath90.1  per pixel .",
    "we obtained observations in the @xmath0 band during each visit and observations in the @xmath10 and @xmath6 bands for most of the visits ( see table [ irphot ] for details ) .",
    "on photometric nights , a standard star at similar air mass ( p133c , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was observed in the same filters . a typical observing sequence consisted of 20 to 30 second exposures in a 5-point cross - shaped dither pattern with @xmath920  dithers .",
    "most nights , this sequence was executed twice in the @xmath0 band , with a 5  random offset of the telescope between maps .",
    "data were reduced in iraf as prescribed in the whirc reduction manual @xcite.the raw images were corrected for non - linearity and sky subtracted using a median - filtered sky frame obtained from each 5-point map .",
    "the images were flat - fielded with dome flats corrected for the pupil ghost ( an inherent feature of whirc images resulting from internal reflections from the optical elements ) using the iraf routine mscred.rmpupil .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on each sky - subtracted , flatfielded image using typical apertures of 3  diameter and a surrounding sky annulus of 0.5  width . on nights",
    "where the seeing fwhm was greater than 1.0 , a 4 or 5  aperture diameter was used .",
    "we did not have a template image to subtract the host galaxy light as is commonly done for sne .",
    "the host background is relatively smooth in the region chosen for the sky .",
    "in addition , inspection of two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) images of the region reveal no point source at the location of sn  2011fe to 3@xmath11 limits of 17.5 , 17.4 , and 16.7 in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , well below the brightness of the sn itself .",
    "all photometry of sn  2011fe was calibrated relative to a local calibrator , the nearby 2mass source 14031367 + 5415431 .",
    "this star lies approximately 80  sw of sn  2011fe , within the same whirc field , so the relative photometry should be independent of atmospheric transparency or extinction . because of the relatively large ( 0.024 mag ) published uncertainties in the 2mass calibration , the nearby photometric standard p133c @xcite was observed on ten photometric nights to calibrate the local 2mass standard using canonical atmospheric extinction coefficients of 0.08 , 0.04 , and 0.07 mag / airmass for the @xmath10 , @xmath0 , and @xmath6 filters , respectively .",
    "the corrections to the 2mass magnitudes of the local calibrator to the persson standard were small ( @xmath12 mag ) , with our final values being @xmath13 mag , @xmath14 mag , and @xmath15 mag in @xmath10 , @xmath0 , and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the flux - calibrated magnitudes of sn  2011fe are presented in table [ irphot ] and plotted in figure [ lcfig ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are the rms of the mean of the individual images with the error in the calibration of the standard ( which is the dominant source of error ) included .",
    "in addition , the brightness of the local standard 2mass 14031367 + 5415431 was measured relative to another 2mass star in the field ( 14025941 + 5416266 ) on all nights to ensure against intrinsic variability of the local standard .",
    "over the course of the observations , the rms uncertainty in the differential photometry of these two stars was 0.015 mag , which can be considered an upper limit on any intrinsic variability .",
    "if nights judged not to be photometric are excluded , this rms uncertainty decreases to 0.010 mag .",
    "in order to calibrate sn  2011fe against other sne  ia , we compared our photometry with that of @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that there is a weak relationship between absolute luminosity and decline rate in the @xmath10 and @xmath0 bands .",
    "optical photometry of sn  2011fe indicates that it is a `` normal '' sn ia with a @xmath16 value of @xmath91.2 @xcite , so we will not make any corrections for decline rate ( as the correction suggest by @xcite is minimal at this decline rate ) . @xcite",
    "provide templates of light curves of sne  ia in @xmath17 and @xmath6 .",
    "we fit our data to the templates using a @xmath18 minimization .",
    "we restricted the fit to epochs ranging from 10 days before @xmath1-band maximum light ( the earliest points in the templates ) to 25 days after @xmath1-band maximum ( when differences in filter bandpasses and spectral features combine to create deviations from the templates ) .",
    "we restricted the fit to 19 days after @xmath1-band maximum for the @xmath10 band as it showed larger deviations from the templates .",
    "the @xmath10 filter in whirc is significantly different than the @xmath10 filter used for the @xcite templates ( and the @xmath6 filter has differences as well ) .",
    "details on the whirc filter bandpasses are available from the whirc website and are shown compared to 2mass and carnegie supernova program ( csp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) filter bandpasses in figure [ filtfig ] .",
    "the @xcite templates are defined relative to @xmath1-band maximum .",
    "we did not have optical photometry , so both the scaling in magnitude and the epoch were free parameters in the fit .",
    "for all three bandpasses , we derived the same epoch of @xmath1-band maximum , 2011 september 9.9 @xmath19 0.2 ( mjd 55813.9 , consistent with the time derived by other groups ; w. li , private communication ) .    from the @xcite templates we can derive the maximum in each passband ( we missed a measurement of that epoch as a result of poor weather ) as well as the magnitude in each band at the time of @xmath1-band maximum .",
    "the values at @xmath1-band maximum are the fiducial points of the @xcite templates . for the maximum in each bandpass",
    ", we find @xmath20 mag , @xmath21 mag , and @xmath22 mag . at @xmath1-band maximum",
    ", we find @xmath23 mag , @xmath24 mag , and @xmath25 mag .",
    "to evaluate the uncertainty for each value , we used the @xcite light curves that had at least three points within three days of @xmath1-band maximum to calculate the error of the mean for the template in each band .",
    "templates derived from data taken by the csp @xcite as well as the @xcite data ( shappee & jha , in prep . )",
    "show essentially the same structure near maximum brightness where we are performing the fit and result in similar fits .",
    "@xcite present a third - order polynomial fit for their nir light curves of sne  ia .",
    "this curve is not a good match for our points over the nominal range given by @xcite , most likely as result of their dataset having few points before maximum .",
    "if we restrict the fit to just the points near maximum , we derive @xmath26 mag , @xmath27 mag , and @xmath28 mag ( uncertainties are dominated by the rms values from @xcite fits ) .",
    "all derived magnitudes are consistent with those found using the @xcite templates .",
    "we have not applied any @xmath29 corrections to our photometry .",
    "the redshift of m101 is @xmath30 @xcite , so any @xmath29 correction will be minimal .",
    "the @xcite dust maps imply a foreground extinction of @xmath31 mag , and thus values in the @xmath10 , @xmath0 , and @xmath6 bands less than 0.01 mag . based on narrow  d absorption lines in the spectra of sn  2011fe , @xcite",
    "derive a host - galaxy extinction of @xmath32 mag ( @xcite report a similar result ) .",
    "again , this implies extinctions in the @xmath0 and @xmath6 bands less than 0.01 mag , while the extinction in the @xmath10 band is @xmath12 mag .",
    "given these minimal values , we do not apply any correction to our photometry .",
    "to establish the absolute luminosity calibration of sne  ia , we need sne in nearby galaxies to which distances can be determined by other methods .",
    "there is a rich history of obtaining cepheid - based distances to such host galaxies , using the _ hst _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a discussion of the details associated with these techniques is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "rather , we recognize that m101 provides a better platform for the absolute magnitude calibration , because it is nearby and its distance is better determinable , if not already determined . in addition , the demonstration by @xcite that the @xmath0-band light curves and peak brightnesses of sne  ia are independent of second parameter characteristics of individual sne ( in addition , of course to being almost unaffected by reddening ) , provides a method that mitigates many of the issues that have plagued the earlier attempts and resulted in controversy .",
    "the weak relationship between luminosity and decline - rate in the @xmath10 and @xmath0 bands found by @xcite does add some potential complications for sne ia in the infra - red in general , but not for the particular case of sn  2011fe as its @xmath33 value of 1.2 @xcite .",
    "here we use our data for sn  2011fe to discuss the absolute magnitude anchor for the @xmath0-band calibration of sne  ia , by comparing against currently available cepheid distances to m101 .    for the purpose of comparing our data to absolute calibrations of sne ia in the infra - red",
    ", we will focus on the @xmath0 band , although similar results can be found using the @xmath10 and @xmath6 bands . as can be seen in figure [ filtfig ] , the @xmath0 filter bandpass is the most similar across the data sets used for absolute calibration ( pairitel and csp ) as well as the whirc data .",
    "in addition , not all derivations of absolute calibrations include the @xmath6 band . as an example , @xcite use @xmath0-band magnitudes at @xmath34 and the hubble diagram ( recession velocity vs apparent magnitude ) to , in effect , derive that the absolute @xmath0-band magnitude at @xmath34 is : @xmath35 they then quote @xmath36 mag , by adopting @xmath37 . our measured value of @xmath38 mag for sn  2011fe yields a distance modulus @xmath39 mag if @xmath40 is indeed @xmath41 .",
    "more precisely , sn  2011fe gives the distance modulus to m101 as : @xmath42    note that the main uncertainty comes from the intrinsic rms of @xmath43 mag in @xmath0-band absolute calibration as reported by @xcite , and not from the relatively insignificant uncertainty in the determination of the @xmath0 magnitude at the epoch of @xmath44 .",
    "table [ mods ] lists the various absolute infra - red calibrations for sne  ia ( all essentially based on a cosmology that assumes @xmath45 ) and the distance moduli to m101 derived from these calibrations using our apparent magnitudes for sn  2011fe .",
    "again , in each case the uncertainy is dominated by the absolute calibration , not the photometry of sn  2011fe .",
    "there is a wide range in the absolute calibrations , yielding a span of 0.31 mag in distance modulus depending on the specific calibration used .",
    "the source of this dispersion is not clear , but may be the result of different filters , corrections to those filters , and assumptions that went into the individual analyses .",
    "note also that these calibrations are not all independent , as many use the same data sets and analysis tools .",
    "until the infra - red absolute magnitudes of sne  ia are more firmly settled , there will be some question about their cosmological utility .",
    "@xcite concluded that the distance modulus to m101 from cepheids is @xmath46 mag , where the cepheid distance scale zero - point rests on an adopted lmc distance modulus ( @xmath47 ) of 18.50 mag .",
    "@xcite give @xmath48 mag from an alternative analysis of the same data and an adopted @xmath49 of 18.54 mag .",
    "a more recent comprehensive and completely independent study of cepheids in m101 yields @xmath50 mag @xcite , where the cepheid scale is based on the maser distance to ngc  4258 , which is tantamount to @xmath51 mag .",
    "the differences among these three results thus rest entirely on the adopted zero - point for the respective cepheid p - l relations used by the three sets of authors . comparing the conditional ( @xmath52 ) @xmath0-band distance moduli to m101 from table [ mods ] to the cepheid distances and using equation 2 ( with the appropriate infra - red calibration )",
    ", one finds the infra - red distances can accommodate @xmath40 values from 64 to 74 @xmath53 . using @xmath0-band photometry with nicmos on _ hst _ , and an assumed lmc modulus of 18.50 mag , @xcite obtained distance moduli of 29.53 and 29.19 mag from cepheids ( relative to lmc cepheids , without any metallicity dependence modeling ) in outer and inner fields of m101 , respectively .",
    "they concluded that in addition to metallicity differences , photometry errors from blending are a likely contributor to the observed difference ( with the inner field distance erring on the side of appearing too close ) .",
    "in addition , there are published distances to m101 using non - cepheid based methods .",
    "tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) results span the gamut from @xmath54 mag @xcite to @xmath55 mag @xcite and @xmath56 mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopt the mean of the last 2 values when deriving @xmath40 from the visible light curve of sn  2011fe . using the planetary nebulae luminosity function method @xcite obtained @xmath57 mag .",
    "figure [ distfig ] graphically demonstrates the distance estimates for m101 discussed herein ( using the @xmath0-band calibration for sn  2011fe ) .",
    "presented with this range of results , and given the state of the art uncertainties in our understanding of metallicity dependence and its inter - relation with de - reddening procedures there is no compelling argument that can pinpoint the determined distance to m101 better than the likely range from 29.04 to 29.42 mag . for this range of possible moduli and the range of conditional moduli implied by the @xmath0-band magnitude of sn  2011fe , values of @xmath40 from 56",
    "to 76 @xmath53 can not be ruled out from this sn alone .",
    "it is sobering that m101 , which is nearer than any of the sne  ia calibrating host galaxies used by @xcite or @xcite , and for which there are multiple independent distance determinations , has resulting distance moduli that span a range of @xmath90.4 mag .",
    "other calibrator host - galaxies at distances comparable to virgo and beyond do not offer such cross - validation to scrutinize the robustness of their derived distances .",
    "the source of uncertainty in the distance moduli derived from the magnitudes of sn  2011fe is not just the measurement or the calibration of the sne  ia .",
    "it is also necessary to resolve the cepheid and trgb distance scales and their systematics before a better than 5% accuracy for @xmath40 can be asserted .",
    "we have presented @xmath10 , @xmath0 , and @xmath6 light curves of sn  2011fe in m101 .",
    "the light curves appear to be those of a normal sn ia .",
    "our apparent magnitude in the @xmath0 band at the epoch of @xmath1-band maximum is @xmath2 , implying distance moduli to m101 based on various infra - red absolute calibrations that span a range from 28.86 to 29.17 mag .",
    "this dispersion is comparable to that for traditional distance measures to m101 ( 29.04 to 29.42 mag ) .",
    "this is , however , only one object in a class that still exhibits a small , but significant , intrinsic spread in peak magnitudes . from the dispersion in absolute calibrations of sne",
    "ia in the infra - red , it is clear that they are not yet fully understood .",

    "we would also like to thank the wiyn observatory for their support of this program .",
