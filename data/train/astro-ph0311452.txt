    "the x - ray binary gx  339@xmath04 comprises a compact primary which is a strong black hole candidate ( bhc ) , with mass function of 5.8@xmath40.5  ( hynes 2003 ) and a secondary which is likely to be an evolved low mass star ( shahbaz , fender & charles 2001 ; chaty 2002 ) .",
    "the system has an orbital period of 1.75 days ( hynes 2003 ) and is located at a distance of at least 4 kpc ( zdziarski 1998 ; see also shahbaz , fender & charles 2001 and maccarone 2003 ) , with an orbital inclination of less than 60  to the line of sight , as inferred from the lack of eclipses ( cowley 2002 ) .",
    "gx  339@xmath04 has been a key source in our understanding of the relation between accretion and the production of relativistic jets .",
    "it was the first bhc to reveal a positive correlation between radio and x - ray fluxes in the low / hard x - ray state ( hannikainen 1998 , later quantified by corbel 2003 ) , and to demonstrate an association between the ` quenching ' of core radio emission and the transition to a high / soft x - ray state ( fender 1999 ; see e.g. done 2001 , for a review on x - ray states and fender 2004 for a comparison of radio and x - ray behaviour in galactic bhcs ) .",
    "after spending almost three years in ` quiescence ' , gx  339@xmath04 re - brightened in x - rays at the end of 2002 march ( smith 2002 ) and changed rapidly to a soft outburst state , undergoing a dramatic state change in 2002 may .",
    "this transition was associated with a bright radio flare ( fender 2002 ) , reaching four to five times the brightest radio level ever observed from the source ( see corbel 2000 for the long - term behaviour of gx  3394 ) . by analogy with other systems ( xte  j1550564 , corbel 2001 ) , this flare was likely to be the signature of a powerful ejection event .",
    "repeated radio observations of gx  339@xmath04 have indeed confirmed this association : the 2002 radio flaring has led to the formation of a large - scale relativistic radio jet , whose morphology and dynamics will be presented in the course of this letter .",
    "the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) performed eight continuum observations of gx  339@xmath04 at roughly regular intervals between 2002 april and august , simultaneously at 4800 mhz ( 6.3 cm ) and 8640 mhz ( 3.5 cm ) .",
    "three further observations were performed in 2003 january , march and may at four frequencies : 1384 mhz ( 21.7 cm ) , 2368 mhz ( 12.7 cm ) , 4800 and 8640 mhz .",
    "the atca synthesis telescope is an east - west array of six 22  m antennas with baselines ranging from 31  m to 6  km ; it uses orthogonal polarized feeds and records full stokes parameters ( i , q , u , v ) . the target was systematically offset by about 10 arcsec from the array phase centre , in order to avoid possible artefacts due to system errors such as dc - offsets . in each observation ,",
    "pks  1934638 was used for absolute flux and bandpass calibration , while either pmn  16034904 , pmn  16505044 or pmn  17265529 was the phase calibrator for antenna gains and phases .",
    "the data reduction process and image analysis have been carried out with the multichannel image reconstruction , image analysis and display ( miriad ) software package ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ; sault & killeen 1998 ) .",
    "dates of atca observations are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , superimposed on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer_/all sky monitor ( rxte / asm ) 212 kev light curve of the system .      smith ( 2002 ) reported an increase in the x - ray flux from gx  339@xmath04 , which had been in quiescence for almost three years ( kong 2000 ) , on 2002 march 26 ( mjd 52360 ) .",
    "the source reached a peak flux ( 212 kev ) of @xmath50.8 crab on 2002 may 15 ( mjd 52410 ) , followed by a decrease to @xmath50.4 crab , and a secondary rise to @xmath50.9 crab around mjd 52500 , after which gx  339@xmath04 has started a slow return to ` quiescence ' ( reached by the time of writing ) .",
    "the hardness ratio hr2 suggests that a rapid transition from a low / hard to a softer x - ray state took place a few days before the ( first ) outburst peak , although colour and timing analysis of the rxte proportional counter array data indicates a smooth transition from a low / hard to a very high state in the rising phase , followed by a high / soft state ( or possibly an ` oscillating ' very - high state ) after the peak ( belloni 2002 ; nespoli 2003 ) .",
    "atca observations performed between 2002 april and june have detected the brightest radio flare ever observed by the system , which reached a peak flux density of about 55 mjy on may 14 ( mjd 52408 ) , almost contemporaneously with the ( first ) x - ray peak .    [",
