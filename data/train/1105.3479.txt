    "variability of radio sources at low frequencies is mainly attributed to propagation effects ( scintillations ) induced by large scale electron density inhomogeneities in the inter - stellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , hunstead 1972 ; rickett , coles & bourgois 1984 ; rickett 1990 ; ghosh & rao 1992 ) . the predicted variability structure function of compact radio sources due to scintillations ( e.g. , blandford & narayan 1985 ; goodman & narayan 1985 ; blandford et al .",
    "1986 ; hjellming & narayan 1986 ) is roughly consistent with the typically observed structure function , at least below 5ghz ( e.g. , qian et al . 1995 ; gaensler & hunstead 2000 ) .",
    "these models predict a rise in the structure function up to time scales of @xmath1days at @xmath2ghz and up to @xmath3days at @xmath4ghz , followed by a flattening of the structure function .",
    "specifically , qian et al .",
    "( 1995 ) analyzed radio observations of the compact radio source 1741@xmath5038 ( @xmath6 ) taken in several frequencies between 1.5 and 22ghz .",
    "they compared the observed structure functions with theoretical models for scattering by an extended galactic medium , with and without a thin screen component .",
    "they reported that for frequencies below about 5ghz the observations are consistent with a scattering by an extended galactic medium and a thin screen .",
    "however , above this frequency they found excess variability relative to the models . moreover , at these high frequencies , the structure function continues to rise towards longer time scales .",
    "they suggested that at high frequencies ( @xmath7ghz ) some of the variability of this radio source is intrinsic .",
    "this general picture is also supported by mitchell et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "gaensler & hunstead ( 2000 ) studied the variability of 55 radio calibrators observed by the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope ( most ) at 843mhz .",
    "they constructed the structure function for 18 variable sources .",
    "for the majority of these variable objects the structure function flattens on time scales of a few hundreds days .",
    "furthermore , they confirmed early results ( condon et al .",
    "1979 ) which found that the variability amplitude is increasing as a function of the source spectral index @xmath8 , defined by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the specific flux at frequency @xmath11 .",
    "this is attributed to a correlation between the source angular size and spectral index .",
    "another confirmation for the importance of galactic scintillations is that radio variability depends on galactic latitude ( e.g. , spangler et al .",
    "1989 ; ghosh & rao 1992 ; gaensler & hunstead 2000 ) .",
    "we note however that rys & machalski ( 1990 ) did  not find evidence for increasing fraction of 1.4ghz variability for sources brighter than 100mjy at low galactic latitudes .",
    "lovell et al . ( 2008 ) presented results from the micro - arcsecond scintillation - induced variability ( masiv ) survey conducted at 5ghz . among their findings : half of the sources they monitored exhibit 2%10% rms variations on time scales over two days .",
    "they also found that the structure function of the variable sources rises on time scales of a few days , and the variability amplitudes correlates with the h@xmath8 emission at the direction of the sources .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the variability amplitude decrease with redshift above @xmath12 , presumably due to evolution of the source size with redshift ( see however lazio et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "here we compare the two widest / deepest 1.4ghz sky surveys taken using the very large array ( vla ) , and search for variable sources .",
    "we use these datasets to construct the average structure function on time scales between several months and about five years and to look for indications for intrinsic variability of these sources . in  [ cat ] we present augmented versions of the first and nvss catalogs which contains the mean time in which each source was observed . in  [ crosscorr ]",
    "we cross correlate the two catalogs , and in  [ sf ] we construct the structure function of the variable sources .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in  [ disc ] .",
    "the nvss observations were carried out between june 1993 and april 1999 , while the first survey observations were conducted between march 1993 and september 2002 .",
    "therefore , these observations provide a long baseline to the structure function analysis .",
    "constructing the structure function of variable sources requires knowledge of their fluxes at multiple epochs and the time at which the observations were taken . however , the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al . 1998 ) and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ; becker et al .",
    "1995 ) source catalogs do  not contain the time at which each source was observed .",
    "the reason for this is that the observing times are not well defined .",
    "images in both surveys were taken by scanning the sky in a hexagonal grid in which observing points are separated by @xmath13 .",
    "both surveys were obtained using the vla , in which the full width at half power at 1.4ghz is @xmath14 .",
    "each primary beam field of view was truncated to radii of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the nvss and first surveys , respectively .",
    "therefore , each point on the sky effectively contains information from roughly four different pointings taken at different times .    in order to obtain the epoch",
    "at which each source was observed we downloaded from the vla archive the list of all observing scans which are associated with each sky survey .",
    "next , we cross - correlate the list of observing scans for each project with its catalog of sources .",
    "we use a matching radii equal to the truncation radii of @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the nvss and first surveys , respectively .",
    "this enable us to estimate for each source , the number of observations ( @xmath17 ) , its mean observing time ( over all scan mid times , @xmath18 ) and the time span within which these observation were obtained ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the products are versions of the first and nvss catalogs that contains the observing time , number of observations , and time span of observations for each source . in tables  [ tab : nvsstime][tab : firsttime ] we present a version of these catalogs containing the source coordinates and the observing time information for each source .",

    "( 2002 ) and discussed in gal - yam et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and ofek et al .",
    "however , these previous efforts did  not use the observing time of the sources .",
    "the first catalog contains 816,331 sources , brighter than about @xmath31mjy , mainly in the north galactic cap . about @xmath32% of these sources",
    "have @xmath33days .",
    "the nvss catalog contains 1,773,484 objects with @xmath34deg , brighter than about @xmath35mjy , of which @xmath36% have @xmath33days .",
    "we select all the first sources which deconvolved major and minor axes equal zero ( i.e. , point sources ) , the peak flux density is larger than 5mjy , all the scans composing their flux measurement ( @xmath19 ) were taken within 30 days , and which are isolated from any other first source ( of any kind ) within @xmath37 .",
    "since the resolution of the nvss is @xmath38 , nine times coarser than that of the first survey , the last step is designed to remove nvss sources which flux may be contaminated by multiple first objects .",
    "we found 6463 first sources that satisfy these criteria .",
    "next , from the nvss catalog we select all sources with @xmath33days  we find 1,183,620 sources that satisfy this criterion .    then , for each object in the subset of the first catalog we search for a source in the subset of the nvss catalog which is found within @xmath39 of the first object , and 99.4% of the errors of such sources are smaller than @xmath39 ] .",
    "we found 4367 matched sources .",
    "these matches represent point sources for which we have both a first and nvss flux - density measurements .",
    "we note that only @xmath41 of the first sources in this list have nvss matches .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that we used only nvss sources with @xmath33days .",
    "next , we would like to compare the fluxes of unresolved nvss and first sources .",
    "however , systematic biases in the nvss and/or first flux calibration could effect our analysis .",
    "condon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and becker et al .",
    "( 1995 ) discussed photometric errors such as the clean bias , and they made corrections to their source catalogs flux densities .",
    "for both the nvss and first catalogs the clean bias is @xmath42 mjy , i.e. of order the rms noise in the images .",
    "there is also a well - known discrepancy between integrated fluxes of extended sources in first and nvss , owing to resolution effects ( blake & wall 2002 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : first_nvss_flux_bias ] we show the mean of the peak - flux ratio between matched individual nvss and first point sources , as a function of flux density ( black circles ) .",
    "this figure suggests that at the faint end , nvss fluxes are systematically lower than first fluxes .",
    "blake & wall ( 2002 ) already reported this effect , although with an opposite direction and higher amplitude .",
    "however , blake & wall ( 2002 ) looked at both resolved and unresolved sources , while we are interested only in point sources .",
    "probably the most important reason for this trend is related to the fact that the nvss and first surveys have different resolutions .",
    "another secondary effect is a bias similar to the eddington bias ( eddington 1913 ) .",
    "this is because sources which flux expectancy value is smaller than 5mjy ( our first flux cut ) and are detected in the first survey above 5mjy ( due to measurement errors ) have @xmath43% chance to have an nvss flux density below 5mjy .",
    "this effect is amplified by the fact that faint sources are more common , per unit flux density , than bright sources .",
    "the estimated amplitude of this bias , based on simulations , is shown by the gray line in figure  [ fig : first_nvss_flux_bias ] .",
    ", width=321 ]    given these results we correct the nvss fluxes of the matched point sources and [ tab : nvsstime ] are not corrected for this bias .",
    "] by the amount interpolated from the black circles in figure  [ fig : first_nvss_flux_bias ] . above 20mjy",
    "we assume that the correction factor is 1 .",
    "we neglect the effect of the eddington bias , since its expected amplitude is negligible ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : first_nvss_flux_bias ] ) .",
    "we note that the maximum amplitude of the applied correction is smaller than the rms noise in the nvss measurements and comparable to rms noise of first sources .",
    "a caveat in our bias analysis is that this bias may also depend on the actual angular extent of the unresolved sources .",
    "therefore , the bias expectation value for a given flux may depends on a `` hidden '' parameter which value is not measured , and can not be entirely removed from the data .    the first vs. nvss peak flux - density measurements of the matched point sources are presented in figure  [ fig : first_nvss_flux ] .     below and above the 1:1 line .",
    "open boxes shows the 43 sources that are variable by more than @xmath44 , while all the other matched sources are marked by dots .",
    "we note that there are more variable sources below the lower line than above the upper line ( see text ) .",
    "[ fig : first_nvss_flux],width=321 ]    based on this plot we estimate the standard deviation , @xmath0 , of the differences between first and nvss specific fluxes as a function of first flux .",
    "this is done by calculating the 68-percentile range in the flux - flux plot as a function of the first flux density , @xmath45 .",
    "we divide the 68 percentile by @xmath46 to estimate the standard deviation , and then fit a first order polynomial to the logarithm of the standard deviation estimator as a function of flux density .",
    "we find that the relative errors associated with these difference measurements are well represented by @xmath47 here we define variables as objects for which the first vs. nvss flux difference is larger corresponds to probability of @xmath48 while the number of measurements in our experiment ( number of epochs multiplied by the number of sources ) is @xmath49 . ] than @xmath44 .",
    "we found 43 such variable sources , which are listed in table  [ tab : table_var ] .",
    "we inspected the radio images of all these variable sources by eye , and comments on individual sources appear in this table .",
    "we note that the theoretical errors are smaller , and have different functional forms , than those implied by equation  [ eq : std ] .",
    "however , in order to avoid any possible uncertainties in the comparison between the two catalogs , we used the empirical errors .",
    "although we attempt to correct for the flux bias between first and nvss sources , in figure  [ fig : first_nvss_flux ] there are more variable sources below the lower 4-@xmath0 line than above the upper 4-@xmath0 line .",
    "this systematic difference may be related to the complexity of the bias between the first and nvss measurements , mentioned earlier .",
    "effectively , this systematic bias induces errors in the number of `` sigmas '' in which a source is variable .",
    "however , the ratio of number of sources above the upper 4-@xmath0 line to that below the lower 4-@xmath0 line , is consistent with an additional systematic shift in the flux ratio of @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that since we used a relatively large variability threshold of 4@xmath0 , most of our variable sources are probably real .",
    "next , we calculate the mean structure function for all the 43 sources which exceed the 4-@xmath0 variability threshold in figure  [ fig : first_nvss_flux ] . as a reference we also calculated the structure function for all the 3906 `` non - variable '' sources defined here as sources",

    "therefore , the fact that we do  not see any significant rise in the structure function on time scales of months to years suggests that , at 1.4ghz , the amplitude of intrinsic variability relative to scintillations is small .",
    "alternatively , it may suggest that the 1.4ghz power spectrum of agn radio variability is consistent with a white - noise power spectrum , rather than the red - noise power spectrum typically seen at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , giveon et al .",

    "we note that padrielli et al .",
    "( 1987 ) reported on a class of sources ( denoted `` c - bbv '' in their terminology ) which show correlated intrinsic variability in low ( 0.4ghz ) and high ( 14.5ghz ) frequencies .",
    "however , these sources are a minority among the variable sources in their sample .",
    "the first bin contains two variables out of 42 objects ( a fraction of 0.048 ) .",
    "however , the expectation value in this bin , estimated based on the mean fraction of variables ( dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : gallat_fracvar ] ; @xmath240 ) multiplied by the number of sources in the first bin ( 42 ) is 0.457 . assuming a binomial distribution , the cumulative probability to observe @xmath241 events , given an expectation value of 0.457 , is 7.7% .",
    "this rules out the null hypothesis that the low - latitude variable - fraction is drawn from a uniform all - sky distribution at the 92.3% confidence .",
    "therefore , a larger sample is required in order to confirm the earlier claims that the fraction of variables is larger at low galactic latitude ( e.g. , gaensler & hunstead 2000 ) .",
    "if this excess is real , then a plausible explanation is that it is due to ism scintillations which are more prominent at low galactic latitudes .",
    "however , we can not rule out that some of this excess in variability is due to a population of galactic variable sources as suggested by becker et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "finally , we use our dataset to look for correlation of the variability amplitude with redshift .",
    "there are several factors that can contribute to such a correlation . for example",
    ", scintillations depends on the source angular size ( larger amplitude for smaller sources ) , intrinsic source size evolution , broadening due to scattering , and maybe even scintillation in the intra - galactic medium ( which may depends on the he re - ionization ) .",

    "[ fig : z_amplitude],width=321 ]    the spearman rank ( pearson ) correlation coefficient between the redshift and the relative variability amplitude is 0.59 ( 0.79 ) . in order to estimate the significance of this correlation we conduct @xmath242 bootstrap simulations ( efron 1982 ; efron & tibshirani 1993 ) . in each simulation",
    "we select , for each source redshift , a random variability amplitude from the list of nine amplitudes .",
    "we find that the probability to get a spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath243 is about 5% .",
    "therefore , unlike lovell et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we do  not find any strong evidence for correlation between scintillations and redshift .",
    "however , our sample is considerably smaller than the one presented by lovell et al .",
    "we note that eight out of the nine sources in figure  [ fig : z_amplitude ] are found above galactic latitude of 40deg , and one source is at galactic latitude of about 18deg . removing the single low galactic latitude source ( the source at @xmath244 in figure  [ fig : z_amplitude ] )",
