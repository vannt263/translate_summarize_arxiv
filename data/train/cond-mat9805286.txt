    "non - analytic flow behavior is seen in a wide range of complex fluids , including polymer melts @xcite , wormlike micelles @xcite , and lamellar surfactant phases @xcite . in the `` spurt effect '' in pipe flow",
    "@xcite the flow rate increases discontinuously above a given applied pressure gradient . in couette",
    "flow this behavior manifests itself in non - analyticities in the steady state flow curves of wall stress as a function of relative cylinder velocity , with either a discontinuity or a discontinuous first derivative in the apparent constitutive curve . in some worm - like micellar solutions",
    "this flow behavior coincides with a range of strain rates for which macroscopic phase separation is observed @xcite under controlled strain rate conditions , with stresses on a well defined , reproducible , and history - independent plateau .    although wall slip or internal fracture , rather than bulk instability , has been suggested to explain the spurt effect @xcite , bulk phase separation is undisputed in the wormlike micelle system .",
    "this phenomenon has often been interpreted in terms of a non - monotonic constitutive curve analogous to a van der waals loop , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : js ] . here",
    "@xmath0 is the shear component of the fluid stress tensor , @xmath1 is the coordinate in the flow direction , and @xmath2 is in the gradient direction .",
    "there are many kinds of non - monotonic behavior @xcite , and we focus here on systems with multiple strain rates for a given stress .",
    "constitutive curves of this character are found in the phenomenological johnson - segalman ( js ) model @xcite , the doi - edwards microscopic reptation model for polymers @xcite and the similar model of for wormlike micelles ( both augmented with a stabilizing high shear - rate branch ) , and other recent models for branched polymers @xcite .",
    "these flow curves have regions of negative slope , @xmath3 , which are hydrodynamically unstable . for applied strain rates in these unstable regions , a reasonable scenario consistent with experiments",
    "is for the system to break up into bands of different flow rates , each band lying on a stable part ( @xmath4 ) of the curve .",
    "this possibility has been studied for various models of non - newtonian fluids @xcite .",
    "however , the stress can apparently lie anywhere within a range of stresses .",
    "this degeneracy of _ selected _ stresses has engendered much discussion , and is at odds with the wormlike micelles , which shear - band at a well - defined stress that is independent of flow history @xcite .",
    "most experiments are performed under conditions which impose inhomogeneous stress .",
    "for example , in pressure - driven ( poiseuille ) pipe flow the steady state shear stress varies linearly with distance from the center of the pipe , while in cylindrical couette flow the stress varies as the inverse of the square of the radius .",
    "there is a growing body of theoretical work addressing shear banding in inhomogeneous flow conditions ; in particular , we are interested in the relationship between the degeneracy of models such as the local js model , and the possible history - dependence in different flow geometries , and how to resolve this degeneracy .    studied the stability and hysteresis of shear banding in a modified local doi - edwards fluid in pipe flow , and found that normal stress effects should affect the stability of banded flows . and studied the local js model in planar poiseuille flow and presented a comprehensive phase - plane analysis of the steady state behavior , showing how a hysteresis loop resulted from a particular flow history .",
    "studied shear banding in start - up flows of the js model in couette flow , and demonstrated that the curved geometry of couette flow produces a simple well - controlled banded flow , in contrast to planar flow , in which start - up calculations of similar local models give an uncontrolled number of bands . more recently the degeneracy of the js model was studied in cylindrical couette @xcite and poiseuille @xcite geometries , with the conclusion in each case that selection of a given banded steady state depends on the initial perturbation .    in this paper",
    "we first study the consequences of degeneracy for the history dependence of banded solutions to the local js model in cylindrical couette flow by imposing several flow histories .",
    "we find , similar to and with the js model in pipe flow , that the apparent flow curves ( in this case , wall stress as a function of relative cylinder , or `` gap '' , velocity ) depend on flow history .",
    "we restrict ourselves to four basic flow histories and demonstrate how to produce a continuum of possible solutions . even in the curved geometry ,",
    "the solution is unstable with respect to noise in the initial conditions , as in the planar case @xcite .",
    "this is in distinct contrast to the many experiments which have found a reproducible and unique selected shear stress in systems as diverse as worm - like micelles and surfactant lamellar phases .    to explore unique stress selection",
    "we add an additional term to the js model , which could be thought of as stress relaxation by diffusion of differently - strained polymer strands @xcite .",
    "such `` gradient terms '' are not usually included in constitutive equations , but arise naturally in treatments of hydrodynamics of liquid crystals , binary fluids , and polymer blends , and are expected to be present ( albeit small ) even in one component melts .",
    "such terms will be most important exactly in the highly inhomogeneous interface between shear bands , and constitute a _ singular perturbation _ on the equations of motion , with a profound effect on stress selection @xcite .",
    "previous workers have used gradient terms to study stress selection in models for liquid crystals in planar shear flow @xcite , and in a one - dimensional scalar model for banded flow in micelle solutions by .",
    "although we make no claims that the js model accurately approximates these systems , it is a simple model which possesses the requisite non - monotonic constitutive flow curve and whose dynamics , as suggested by berret , is compatible to some aspects of kinetics experiments of shear banding in solutions of wormlike micelles @xcite .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows .",
    "in section  [ sec : model ] we present the equations for the js model in couette flow , including the new diffusion term . in section  [ sec : dzero ] we present the results from numerical experiments for prescribed strain rates ( gap velocity ) and different flow histories in the _ absence _ of diffusion ; and in section  [ sec : dnonzero ] we examine the effect of diffusion , which renders the model more realistic with respect to the body of work on complex fluids which display unique stress selection .",

    "the other three scenarios produce the normal two band sequence high - low .",
    "finally , another history - dependent feature occurs on ramp - up and ramp - down scenarios .",
    "the size of the high shear rate band in steady banded flow and therefore the torque value depends on the magnitude of the differences @xmath100 between succesive velocities .",
    "if the velocity is changed quasi - statically ( infinitesimal changes of @xmath50 ) , flow curves are smooth and correspond to top and bottom jump ( the total shear stress at the position of the interface corresponds to the maximum and minimum values of the local constitutive relation ) on ramp - up and ramp - down respectively .",
    "large velocity changes produce spikes in the flow curve , both on ramp - up and ramp - down .",
    "the reason for this is the pinning of the interface at a stress value which is lower than the maximum allowed value or higher than the minimum allowed value , and has been also noticed by for a different diffusionless model .",
    "2      the dynamical selection of steady states in the four scenarios is unstable with respect to noise in the initial conditions . to show this we used perturbed initial conditions at each new velocity value , in the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the three steady - state components of the material stress obtained at step i-1 , and @xmath103 are random , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath104 and uncorrelated , @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",

    "[ fig : attractors]a ) leads to an identical final banded steady state ( point @xmath115 ) . for higher initial gap velocities @xmath116 ( initial states between points",
    "f and b on the flow curve , fig .",
    "[ fig : attractors]a ) the final torque spans the interval @xmath117 between the jump - up and jump - down branches ( the discreteness in fig .",
    "[ fig : attractors ] is a finite mesh effect ) .",
    "the jump - up from rest branch is thus the lower limit of a continuous family of jump - up attractors .",
    "similarly , jumping - down from a velocity @xmath118 ends on the attractor branch @xmath119 which represents the upper limit of jump - down attractors which collect trajectories with @xmath120 ( fig .",

    "2 despite the interesting structure of these dynamics , experiments on wormlike micelles invariably display unique banding flows , independent of history and initial conditions .",
    "this is incompatible with the numerical results obtained for @xmath121 ; as we shall see in the following , the imposition of non - vanishing stress diffusion @xmath122 provides a route for constructing unique banding flows @xcite .    2",

    "in contrast to planar flow , for which the flow curve has a flat stress plateau , in cylindrical couette flow the torque in the banding part of the flow curve has a slight dependence on the imposed gap velocity ( fig .",

    "the positive slope plateau @xmath134 corresponds to the conventional two - band flow with the high shear rate band at the inner cylinder , while for the negative slope plateau @xmath135 the band sequence is inverted .",
    "the normal band sequence can be obtained by jumping up from rest for small gap velocities ( between @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) and the inverted sequence can be obtained by jumping up from rest only for high gap velocities ( between @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) . in order to scan the entire lengths @xmath139 and @xmath140 of the plateaus , ramping is necessary after jumping up , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : hysteresis]a ) which is slightly different than the top - jump value .",
    "@xmath163 converges to the top - jump value when @xmath165 .",
    "on ramping back down the interface between bands is eliminated when it reaches a distance from the wall of order its width ( point @xmath166 ) .",
    "the difference between the corresponding gap velocity @xmath167 and the extrapolation to the low strain rate branch scales like @xmath168 .",
    "furthermore the width of the hysteresis loops , @xmath169 , increases with decreasing @xmath145 , consistent with the banded plateau remaining until the interface `` touches '' a cylinder wall . for large enough",
    "@xmath126 hysteresis vanishes .    for small",
    "@xmath126 the hysteresis loop at the low shear rate end of the plateau contains the metastable part @xmath170 of the low shear rate branch .",
    "this is reminiscent of the experimental results of : under controlled strain rate conditions they found a stress ( analogous to @xmath166 in fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis]a ) below which the system remained homogeneous , and above which the high strain rate band nucleated .",
    "similar phenomena are expected at the high shear rate end of the plateau , but an experimental study of this region raises difficult problems because of various noise sources .    2",
    "we have studied shear banding in the local ( @xmath171 ) johnson - segalman model in cylindrical couette flow under controlled strain rate conditions .",
    "the inhomogeneous flow conditions of the couette geometry generate history dependent steady states with a single interface of zero width .",
    "we have outlined some of the behavior under various flow histories , and identified families of attractors which govern the behavior in the absence of non - local terms in the dynamics .    to recover a unique stress and the history independence seen in experiments , it is necessary to augment local constitutive equations with non - local information .",
    "we have added a simple diffusion term and shown that the banding profile is , in the main , history independent .",
    "the steady state flow curves we have found are consistent with the growing body of work on wormlike micelles ; moreover , regions of the flow curves suggest the analogs of metastability , supercooling , and nucleation and growth , and are suggestive of recent experiments on wormlike micelles @xcite .",
    "the flow curves have a selected banding torque which increases with increasing gap velocity , with a more pronounced increase for more highly curved couette geometries .",
    "the diffusion term represents a singular perturbation which allows the interface to only lie at that position for which the shear stress has a well defined selected value . in the couette geometry",
    "this position in unique , and multi - interface steady state solutions are prohibited .",
    "n for flatter geometries a metastable inverted band sequence exists , with the high strain rate phase near the outer cylinder . however , there is as yet no accepted theory for diffusion terms in wormlike micelle solutions , and nor have they been measured .",
    "our results suggest further interesting effects to study , such as band nucleation and expulsion , interface motion , and kinetics , which we hope to address in the future .",
    "for example , @xmath145 controls interface speed , which thus provides a possible experimental measure of this unknown quantity .",
    "_ _ note added__after this manuscript was completed we learned of recent work by , in which the js model was supplemented with a diffusion term in the strain rate ( effectively a non - local viscosity ) , and calculations were performed using a 2 + 1d eulerian - lagrangian technique in planar shear flow .",
    "yuan also found unique stress selection in the presence of a diffusion term , but the results with no diffusive term still gave unique ( and different ) stress selection .",
    "this indicates that either the numerical discretization technique introduces spurious non - local terms into the dynamics , or that the larger fluctuation phase space of higher dimensions somehow stabilizes a unique stress in the absence of diffusion terms .",
    "the latter possibility appears to contradict .",
