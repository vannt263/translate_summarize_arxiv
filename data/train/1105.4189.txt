    "in 1954 dicke introduced the phenomenon of _ superradiance _ , a quantum interference effect induced by symmetries of spin - boson interactions , in which many interacting atoms could collectively conspire to yield an enhanced relaxation rate @xcite . due to this fundamental non - classical cooperation ,",
    "the probability of a single photon emission from a @xmath0 identical atoms collectively interacting with vacuum fluctuations becomes n times larger than incoherent individual spontaneous emission probabilities @xcite .",
    "superradiant radiative relaxation can also occur in molecular aggregates due to inherent coherent feature of frenkel exciton dynamics .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed when a closely packed group of molecules interacting under certain symmetry can collectively donate an excitation with a rate which is much faster than each individual molecule .",
    "the adversarial effects of inhomogeneous broadening and exciton - phonon interactions on such cooperative relaxation in molecular systems have been studied in detail @xcite",
    ".    the same symmetry principles that underlie superradiance can give rise an analogous phenomenon known as cooperative energy transfer or _ supertransfer _ @xcite .",
    "generally , the exciton transfer rate can be calculated from the transition probability of an excitation jumping from one molecule to another using fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) , based on a perturbation treatment of the dipole - dipole interaction between individual molecules . however ,",
    "under strong and symmetrized interactions of a group of @xmath0 molecules the excitation becomes highly delocalized , leading to a large ( effective ) dipole moment associated with the entire group .",
    "the resulting enhanced oscillator strength can lead to supertransfer when similar molecular assemblies , with comparable effective dipole moments , exist that can play the role of acceptors . under such conditions",
    "the rate of exciton dynamics should be calculated from these effective large dipole - dipole interactions to describe the coherent donation and acceptance among such molecular aggregates , with up to @xmath1 enhancement over the single molecule to single molecule transfer rate , even in the far field @xcite .",
    "a primary goal of this paper is to study the behaviour of superradiance , supertransfer , and other non - classical collective phenomena in presence of disorder and environmental fluctuations similar to those natural conditions of photosynthetic light - harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "recently , the existence and role of quantum coherence in the dynamics of excitation energy transfer in biological systems have been of significant interest both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "such studies can provide novel concepts and techniques for a deeper understanding of natural / engineering excitonic systems potentially leading to efficient and robust artificial light - harvesting @xcite .",
    "a major problem in design and fabrication of novel excitonic devices is the limited exciton diffusion length that could be of about 10 nm in disordered materials .",
    "this issue has lead to low efficiency and complicated device structures in organic photovoltaic cells @xcite , and it is a bottleneck in the performance of excitonic transistors @xcite and organic light emitting diodes @xcite . a key open question is whether one can use quantum - mechanical supertransfer effects to enhance exciton diffusion length in such disordered systems .",
    "recent experimental investigations of nano - engineered biological systems suggest that under laboratory conditions certain aspects of photosynthetic complexes can be emulated that could be potentially exploited for efficient energy transport @xcite . in particular ,",
    "excitonic diffusion lengths up to a micron have been recently reported in engineered arrays of lh2 complexes @xcite .",
    "self assembled ring structures containing fluorescent chromophores attached to tobacco mosaic virus coat monomers exhibit efficient exciton transport together with a broad spectrum light collection with over 90% efficiency @xcite .",
    "it is of considerable interest to explore whether the energy transport mechanism in such systems was facilitated in part due to symmetries in the arrangement of chromophores , which give could rise to the phenomenon of supertransfer @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate excitonic transport in systems consisting of rings of chromophores stacked in cylindrical arrays , as a function of the number of chromophores per ring , the spacing between rings , and the strength of decoherence and disorder .",
    "we also investigate excitonic transport in dipole - coupled spiral structures .",
    "such geometries are relevant not only to the experimentally investigated systems mentioned above , but to naturally occurring cylindrical arrays of chromophores such as the green sulphur bacterium chlorosome .",
    "we use the symmetries of the system to derive analytic solutions for the behavior of the closed system in the absence of environmental interactions , and perform simulations to capture the dynamics of excitonic diffusion in the presence of environmentally - induced noise and disorder .",
    "our results provide clear evidence for the presence of supertransfer in the appropriate regimes and for the destruction of supertransfer in other regimes .    specifically , we study the effect of supertransfer on the diffusion length @xmath2 of an initially delocalized exciton along a linear chain of chromophoric rings and helical rods , mediated by dipolar couplings between chromophores .",
    "supertransfer - induced enhancements in the hopping rate translate into a commensurate increase in the distance travelled by the excitons .",
    "the strength of the supertransfer effect depends on the number of chromophores per ring @xmath0  higher @xmath0 yields higher supertransfer rates , and on the distances between rings ",
    "smaller inter - ring distances yields larger asymmetries and diminishes supertransfer . by changing the strength of the interaction with the environment , we investigate excitonic transport in both coherent / ballistic and incoherent / diffusive regimes . by changing the degree of disorder ,",
    "we investigate how the degree of localization depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis is carried out analytically in the closed system case , and numerically in the presence of disorder and interactions with a bosonic bath .",
    "our analytic and numeric solutions allow us to investigate scenarios where rings are packed closely in a cylinder , and where chromophores are arranged in spirals .",
    "the concept of supertransfer can be easily reviewed in the case of two spin systems @xmath3 and @xmath4 , each containing @xmath5 and @xmath6 sites respectively , invariant under permutation symmetry @xcite . in the presence of such symmetric couplings ,",
    "the hopping rate from the symmetrized single - excitation state of @xmath3 to the symmetrized single - excitation state of @xmath4 is @xmath7 times the hopping rate of a localized excitation from one of the @xmath3 to one of the @xmath4 sites .",
    "( the effect can be even larger  up to @xmath8  for multiple excitation states @xcite . for simplicity , this paper will focus on single exciton states . )",
    "supertransfer can be captured in a simple way by the following symmetric hopping hamiltonian : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 labels the @xmath5 sites , and @xmath11 the @xmath6 sites of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . introducing the angular momentum operators @xmath12 the previous hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath13 from the above expressions , the probability amplitude for a single symmetrized excitation state @xmath14 over the system @xmath3 , @xmath15 , to hop to a corresponding symmetrized state over system @xmath4 is given by @xmath16 , in first order perturbation theory .",
    "the corresponding transition probability @xmath17 is therefore @xmath18 times the probability @xmath19 for a localized exciton state @xmath20 to hop from one of the @xmath3 sites to any one of the @xmath4 sites .",
    "this enhancement effect in the hopping rate is called supertransfer @xcite .",
    "the key feature of supertransfer is coherence within the individual systems @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "supertransfer between @xmath3 and @xmath4 can either be coherent or incoherent , depending on the spatial separation of systems and strength of the interaction with the environment .      here",
    ", we study supertransfer effects in cylindrical aggregates of sites interacting via a @xmath21 potential . we apply our analysis to the transition dipoles of an array of chromophores to look at excitonic hopping through the array .",

    "in the second geometry , chromophores form helical rods , with their positions given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pitch of the helix , @xmath22 its radius , @xmath0 the number of chromophores per turn , with @xmath23 turns in total , and @xmath30 .",

    "this simplified assumption will be relaxed below .",
    "the influence of the environment over the system will be considered by including both on - site energy disorder and on - site dephasing ( haken - strobl model ) which has recently been widely used for studying environment effects on energy transport in light - harvesting systems , e.g. , see refs @xcite . in ( [ hamsym ] ) , @xmath41 represents the average molecular excitation energy , which can be dropped by shifting all the energies by @xmath41 .",

    "an important observation is that the hamiltonian of the linear chain of rings is very close to a block circulant structure .",

    "the actual chain hamiltonian @xmath109 , does not possess periodic boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , for times short enough so that boundary effects can be neglected , we will see that the analytical expression for diffusion @xmath2 obtained assuming block - circularity matches quite well the numerical results .",

    "let us then consider the matrix @xmath125 as being block circulant , with circulant blocks .",
    "such hamiltonian will have the form @xmath126 , where @xmath127 .",

    "its real eigenvalues @xmath133 become @xmath138 doubly degenerate for @xmath139 , and @xmath102 doubly degenerate for @xmath140 , and are of the form @xmath141 .",

    "a couple of simple cases will help us understand these expressions .    in the `` far - field '' regime , with @xmath89",
    ", the couplings among the rings will be highly symmetric , similar to ( [ simham ] ) .",
    "for this case , @xmath145 , with the rest of the block matrices @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is an @xmath113 matrix with ones as entries and @xmath148 is the strength of the symmetric couplings between two nearest neighbouring rings , separated by a distance d. the expressions above for the diffusion will read @xmath149 , @xmath150 , so that the symmetric couplings between the rings produce a linear scaling of the diffusion as a function of the number of sites @xmath0 , and @xmath66 , for a delocalized and localized initial states , respectively .",
    "thus , we proved that a linear dependence with the number of particles @xmath0 occurs under symmetric couplings , and will be use in the rest of this work as a proof of supertransfer .",
    "we also obtain that for a @xmath21 dipole - dipole decaying interaction , the diffusion decreases as @xmath151 , with d the distance between rings , and is directly proportional to the typical interaction strength j. if all the interactions among the rings were included , the above expressions change to @xmath152 , @xmath153 .    in the `` near - field '' regime , with @xmath154 ,",
    "the scaling with @xmath0 can increase beyond @xmath0 or @xmath66 for @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "the reason comes from how the interaction terms @xmath157 and @xmath158 scale up with n. without loss of generality , let s consider two nearest neighbours rings .",
    "the interaction term for the delocalized case is of the form @xmath159 , which exhibits a scaling with @xmath0 faster than linear from @xmath154 , for fixed @xmath11 .",
    "this is a small size effect , and the scaling is linear for @xmath0 large enough ( as can be readily checked by approximating the above sum by an integral for @xmath160 ) .",
    "the expression for the diffusion of a delocalized state ( [ sigmadeloc ] ) shows also some interesting `` interference effects '' , in the sense that partial cancellations can occur when some of the coefficients @xmath135 are negative .",
    "in particular , when the condition @xmath161 is met , the delocalized state does not propagate , while the localized does .",
    "therefore , even in the closed system , an initial delocalized state does not necessarily diffuse longer than a localized state , during times @xmath144 .",
    "figure ( [ predictions ] ) makes a comparison between the simulated value of @xmath162 , for delocalized and localized initial states , and for various values of the distance @xmath24 between the rings . in the far - field regime @xmath89",
    ", we clearly see a linear scaling of diffusion with @xmath0 for a delocalized initial state , and with @xmath66 for a localized state . for the near - field regime @xmath90",
    ", there is a superlinear scaling which arises from the behaviour of the interaction terms in the hamiltonian , as mentioned above . in all cases , there is a good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the numerical simulations . for times longer than @xmath163 ,",
    "the excitons travel long enough so that the effects of the boundaries `` kick in '' , and the block - circularity assumption worsens .",
    "note that the hamiltonian corresponding to the ring where the exciton is initially created does not enter equations ( [ sigmadeloc ] ) and ( [ sigmaloc ] ) , as @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , under the approximation @xmath165 , these expressions for diffusion do not depend on the couplings of the ring where the initial state is located .",
    "the above analysis , that was developed for a stacked ring geometry , can be used to approximate the diffusion in the helical rod setting , if the helices in the rod are approximated by stacked rings of the same radius @xmath22 , with a distance between them equal to the pitch of the helix @xmath166 , and with number of chromophores per ring @xmath0 , equal to that in the rods per turn .",
    "figure ( [ ringsapprox ] ) exhibits this approximation .",
    "the blue circles correspond to numerical simulations for the spiral geometry with given @xmath22 and pitch @xmath29 , while the red stars depicts the formulas ( [ sigmadeloc ] ) , ( [ sigmaloc ] ) obtained from a set of facing rings with radius @xmath22 and separation @xmath167 , indicating that the approximation given by the rings structure is quite good . in principle , if the number of chromophores per turn is not an integer , the angular position of the rings should be shifted by a given amount to account for this .",
    "however , due to the parametrization of the spiral that is being used , the nodes are perfectly aligned along the axis of the spiral , so no `` shift '' of the nodes position inside the rings is necessary .",
    "having elucidated the behaviour of diffusion length in a closed system dynamics , in this section we analyse the behaviour of supertransfer subjected to an open quantum system dynamics , via two effects : on - site energy disorder and on - site dephasing .      for small values of static energy disorder ,",
    "the motion of the exciton should be hardly affected , propagating coherently . for times",

    "the motion is coherent , and we obtain a supertransfer regime @xmath170 , while the exciton gets localized for @xmath56 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from figure ( [ lambdaindiffvsnvsdisor ] ) , where the exponent @xmath59 in @xmath171 shows a coherent ( @xmath60 ) evolution for small values of disorder , and a crossover to classical diffusion takes place when @xmath172 , independently of @xmath0 . in the classical regime , the diffusion fluctuates around @xmath173 .",

    "the areas between different values of disorder provides an indication of how robust diffusion is under changes of disorder . from this observation",
    ", it derives that diffusion seems more robust under changes of disorder in the quantum or ballistic regime ( for @xmath174 ) than in the ballistic regime .",
    "on - site dephasing diminishes the coherence among the sites of the i ring , which is fundamental for supertransfer effects to take place . for a tight - biding hamiltonian on an infinite chain with periodic boundary conditions , nearest neighbour interaction @xmath46 , and dephasing strength @xmath49 ,",

    "a similar behaviour should be expected for the diffusion for the ring structure . for small times",

    "it is possible to verify that dephasing does not contribute to the diffusion , up to second order in the expansion of @xmath182 , with @xmath183 , for @xmath184 being either a localized or delocalized state .",

    "as the number of sites increases , we see a sharper drop of the exponent towards 1/2 .",

    "the @xmath1 enhancement in diffusion prevails for times smaller than the disorder strength , and the system becomes more resilient against random perturbations in the onsite energies for increasing values of the number of nodes @xmath0 per ring or turn of the spiral . due to the quasi 1d nature of the aggregates considered here , supertransfer effects",
    "are fragile to disorder on the site basis energies .",
    "we have shown analytically that the dephasing does not affect the form of our closed expressions for diffusion , up to second order in time , in good agreement with our simulations .",
    "a numerical analysis enabled us to obtain the scaling exponents of sigma with number of nodes @xmath0 and time @xmath102 , revealing a crossover from the ballistic - supertransfer regime , to a diffusive - normal regime , in both cases around the same characteristic time @xmath181 .",

    "<S> symmetric couplings among aggregates of @xmath0 chromophores increase the transfer rate of excitons by a factor @xmath1 , a quantum mechanical phenomenon called `` supertransfer . '' in this work we demonstrate how supertransfer effects induced by geometrical symmetries can enhance the exciton diffusion length by a factor @xmath0 along cylindrically symmetric structures , consisting of arrays of rings of chromophores , and along spiral arrays . we analyse both closed system dynamics and open quantum dynamics , modelled by combining a random bosonic bath with static disorder . in the closed system case , </S>",
    "<S> we use the symmetries of the system within a short - time approximation to obtain a closed analytical expression for the diffusion length that explicitly reveals the supertransfer contribution . </S>",
    "<S> when subject to disorder , we show that supertransfer can enhance excitonic diffusion lengths for small disorders and characterize the crossover from coherent to incoherent motion . owing to the quasi-1d nature of the model </S>",
    "<S> , disorder ultimately localizes the excitons , diminishing but not destroying the effects of supertransfer . when dephasing effects </S>",
    "<S> are included , we study the scaling of diffusion with both time and number of chromophores and observe that the transition from a coherent , ballistic regime to an incoherent , random - walk regime occurs at the same point as the change from supertransfer to classical scaling . </S>"
