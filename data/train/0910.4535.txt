    "the existence of a new strongly  interacting sector that is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking is an interesting possibility .",
    "technicolor was originally proposed thirty years ago , and strongly  interacting bsm has been revisited in many instances since then .",

    "@xcite .    in order to be phenomenologically viable",
    ", technicolor theories need to obey the constraints from precision measurements at lep  @xcite",
    ". moreover the symmetry breaking needs to be communicated to the standard model , so that the usual low  energy physics is recovered .",
    "this is usually achieved in the so - called extended technicolor ( etc ) models by invoking some further interaction at higher energies that couples the technicolor sector to the standard model . at the tev scale",
    "the remnants of this coupling are higher  dimensional operators in the effective hamiltonian , which are suppressed by powers of the high energy scale , @xmath2 , that characterises the extended model . amongst these operators are a mass term for the standard model quarks , and four  fermion interactions that would contribute to flavour  changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "thus there is a tension on the possible values of @xmath2 : on the one hand @xmath2 needs to be large so that fcnc interactions are suppressed , on the other hand @xmath2 needs to be small enough to generate the heavier quark masses . in particular , the effective operator for the standard model quark masses is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicates the quark field , and @xmath5 is the field in the technicolor theory which is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking . in the traditional technicolor models , which are realised as su(@xmath6 )",
    "gauge theories , @xmath7 is the chiral condensate of techniquarks .",
    "let us emphasise that quark masses are defined in a given renormalisation scheme and at a given scale .",

    "( [ eq : chrun ] ) suggests a possible way to resolve the tension due to the large quark masses .",
    "if the technicolor theory is such that @xmath10 is approximately constant ( and large ) over a sufficiently long range in energies , then the running above will generate a power enhancement of the condensate .",
    "this scenario has been known for a long time under the name of _ walking technicolor _",
    "gauge theories with a large number of fermions have been traditional candidates for walking theories ; the fermions slow down the running of the coupling and can potentially lead to the required power  enhancement .",
    "more recent incarnations have been proposed that are constructed as su(n ) gauge theories with fermions in higher  dimensional representations of the colour group  @xcite .",
    "these theories could have a genuine ir fixed point ( irfp ) , or simply lie in its vicinity .",
    "the existence of an irfp is a difficult problem to address since it requires to perform quantitative computations in a strongly  interacting theory .",
    "lattice simulations can provide first ",
    "principle results that can help in determining the phenomenological viability of these models ; numerical simulations of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking have attracted growing attention in recent years  @xcite .",
    "a number of theories have been studied : su(3 ) with 8 , 10 , 12 flavours of fermions in the fundamental representation , su(3 ) with fermions in the sextet representation , and su(2 ) with fermions in the adjoint representation .",
    "these studies have focused either on the spectrum of the theories , or on the running of the coupling computed in the schrdinger functional ( sf ) scheme , finding some tantalising numerical evidence for ir behaviours different from what is known from qcd .",
    "existing simulations of the schrdinger functional have identified a possible fixed point in many of the above  mentioned theories by noticing a flat behaviour of the running coupling in this scheme over a given range of energy scales .    in this work",
    "we consider the su(2 ) theory with two flavours of adjoint fermions , and compute the running coupling in the sf scheme .",
    "we confirm the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and present a more refined analysis of the lattice data .",
    "we focus on the running of the mass in the sf scheme , from which we can extract the mass anomalous dimension that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chrun ] ) .",
    "current simulations are still plagued by systematic errors , which we examine in detail both for the coupling and the mass .",
    "these errors are the largest limitation to drawing strong conclusions from the lattice data .",
    "these limitations are common to all the studies performed so far , more extensive work is required in order to reach robust conclusions .",
    "our results for the anomalous dimension of the mass provide crucial input for these studies that aim at exact results for non - supersymmetric gauge theories in the non - perturbative regime .",

    "[ fig : sfsigmap_extrap ] we see that , unlike @xmath15 , @xmath27 has a significant variation with @xmath51 that is fit well by a linear continuum extrapolation .",
    "the constant extrapolation is only used to quantify the errors in extrapolation .",
    "using the fact that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , we can perform an iterative step scaling of the coupling and the mass to determine the running of the mass with scale . however , since we observe no running of the coupling within errors this is not particularly interesting .",

    "we plot the estimator @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] .",
    "again the error bars come from evaluating the above expression using the extremal values of @xmath61 at each @xmath62 .",

    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest the irfp is in the range @xmath66 ; at the extremes of this range we find @xmath67 and @xmath68 using just the linear continuum extrapolation , and @xmath69 and @xmath68 including the constant continuum extrapolation . over the entire range of couplings consistent with an irfp",
    ", @xmath56 is constrained to lie in the range @xmath70 , even with our more conservative assessment of the continuum extrapolation errors .",
    "[ sec : concl ] in this paper we have presented results for the running of the schrdinger functional coupling @xmath15 and the mass anomalous dimension @xmath10 .    turning first to the running of the coupling , our results are completely consistent with those of ref .",
    "our statistical errors are larger ; however , we have carried out our analysis in a way that aims at disentangling clearly the scale dependence from the lattice artefacts .",
    "our analysis can be systematically improved as more extensive studies are performed , and will ultimately allow us to take the continuum limit with full control over the resulting systematic errors .",
    "our results appear to show a slowing in the running of the coupling above @xmath71 or so , and are consistent with the presence of a fixed point where the running stops at somewhat higher @xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of ref .",
    "however , once we include the systematic errors from the continuum extrapolation we find that our results no longer give any evidence for a fixed point .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that the running of the coupling is very slow in this theory and so great accuracy is needed , in particular near a possible fixed point .",
    "by contrast , we find that the behaviour of the anomalous dimension @xmath10 is much easier to establish .",
    "the systematic errors from the continuum extrapolation are much smaller than the signal , and we find a moderate anomalous dimension , close to the 1-loop perturbative prediction , throughout the range of @xmath47 explored . in particular , in the range @xmath66 , where there may be an infrared fixed point , we find @xmath1 .",
    "these values are much smaller than those required for phenomenology , which are typically of order 1 - 2 .",
    "such large values of @xmath10 are clearly inconsistent with our results .",
    "the anomalous dimension at the fixed point can be computed analytically using the all  order beta function proposed in ref .",
    "the result can be expressed as a function of group  theoretical factors only . using the conventions described in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for these group  theoretical factors , the result in ref .",
    "@xcite yields @xmath72 , which is not too far from the bound we quote above .",
    "given the uncertainty in the exact value of the sf coupling at the fixed point , @xmath72 is not strongly excluded by our current data .",
    "more precise investigations are needed to clarify this point .",
    "the anomalous dimension is easier to measure than the beta function in candidate walking technicolor theories since it is expected to be different from zero , so we are measuring the difference of two quantities that are significantly different , say @xmath27 at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "by contrast for the running of the coupling we must measure the difference of two quantities that are almost the same , since the beta function is expected to be small .",
    "furthermore , the anomalous dimension is crucial for phenomenology ; if it is not large then the presence or absence of walking behaviour becomes academic .",
    "hence the implications of our measurement of @xmath10 for the phenomenology of minimal walking technicolor call for a more precise study .    our conclusion that @xmath10 is not large is unlikely to be affected by using larger lattices .",
    "one can see this by considering the continuum extrapolations in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfsigmap_extrap ] . for @xmath10 to reach ,",
    "say , 1 in the continuum limit , we would need @xmath75 to be @xmath76 at @xmath77 .",
    "however we see that the dependence on @xmath51 is much too small for this to be possible , and indeed is in the wrong direction .",
    "only a very unlikely conspiracy of lattice artifacts would make it possible for @xmath75 to be as small as 0.75 in the continuum limit . on the other hand",
    "the value of @xmath78 corresponding to the irfp is currently not known with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the results presented here are the first computation of the anomalous dimension at a putative fixed point ; the systematic errors need to be reduced to make our conclusions more robust . in particular , using larger lattices would give results at smaller @xmath51 and hence make the continuum extrapolations more accurate .",
    "it may also be necessary to use an improved action in the long term to achieve the precision required to show the existence of an irfp or of walking behaviour .",
    "however , as described above , this is very unlikely to affect our phenomenologically most important result , namely that @xmath10 is not large .",
    "recent results in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that the anomalous dimension can be computed using finite ",
    "size scaling techniques .",
    "a comparison of different techniques will improve the determination of the anomalous dimension .",

    "all possible combinations of these functions gave us a set of @xmath91 values for @xmath49 , each with a statistical error , which spanned the range of the systematic variation .",
    "for each value of @xmath62 the resulting extremal values of @xmath49 were used as upper and lower bounds on the central value .",
