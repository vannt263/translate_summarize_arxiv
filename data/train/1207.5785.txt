    "the strong recent interest in the study of open quantum systems has evidenced that this area is still in a very early stage of development , specially when compared with the knowledge that we have of the closed counterparts . as a consequence",
    ", it has become an extremely active topic in fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "the most important advance concerns scattering systems , where the fractal weyl law ( fwl ) for the number of long - lived resonances has been conjectured and tested in different examples @xcite .",
    "the corresponding classical invariant distribution , i.e. the fractal hyperbolic set of all the trajectories non - escaping in the past and future ( the repeller ) , plays a fundamental role for the interpretation of the quantum spectrum of quasibound ( resonant ) states . according to this law",
    "@xcite the number of long - lived resonances scales as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fractal dimension of the repeller and @xmath2 that of the hilbert space .",
    "after the proof of the fractal weyl upper bound for a hamiltonian flow showing a fractal trapped set @xcite , results that support the validity of the conjectured law both for smooth and hard wall potentials @xcite have followed . however , open quantum maps provide the ideal arena for this kind of studies , due to its computational simplicity @xcite , and accordingly we will focus on them in this work .",
    "another recent advance in the understanding of scattering systems has been the development of the short periodic orbits ( pos ) theory for open quantum maps @xcite .",
    "this theory makes use of the shortest pos living in the repeller to construct a classically motivated basis in which the quantum non unitary operators corresponding to the classical maps can be adequately expressed .",
    "it has been shown that there is a connection between the fwl and the possibility to obtain the quantum long - lived resonances by using the detailed classical information of the repeller , i.e.  the embedded trajectories @xcite .    as a result of all this evidence , the repeller is commonly accepted to be the fundamental invariant classical structure in phase space able to explain the quantum mechanics of open systems . however , in a recent publication @xcite , it has been shown for a set of maps sharing the same repeller and asymptotic features ( including the escape rate ) but having different classical transient behavior , that the quantum properties of the resonances can differ strongly from this view .",
    "this suggests that also transients may play a fundamental role in the description of open quantum systems .",
    "in this paper we further investigate this issue , by presenting a twofold numerical calculation on the tribaker map families introduced in @xcite .",
    "these families differ in the way in which the openings are defined . in the so called shift family",
    "the area of the opening is the same for all of its members , while in the intersection family this area changes .",
    "first , we have verified that the resonance distributions follow the fwl for these two kinds of maps .",
    "second , we have tested the ability of the theory of short pos for open quantum maps to reproduce the eigenvalues and the corresponding resonance eigenfunctions .",
    "this approach is used as a tool to investigate the actual classical support of the quantum resonances , finding that the quantum information of some of the shift family members can not be reproduced .",
    "these results cast doubts on the commonly accepted belief that the repeller is just enough to support the quantization of open maps .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : maps ] we introduce the features of the shift and intersection families of open tribaker maps . in sec .",
    "[ sec : statistics ] we study the effects of classical transients on the spectral statistics .",
    "the same is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : shpoth ] regarding the classical support of open quantum maps by using the theory of short pos as the main tool . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present a final discussion , and our perspectives for future work .",
    "open maps can be defined as the deterministic evolution corresponding to a given ( closed ) map followed by the loss of trajectories which pass through a given region in phase - space .",
    "the set of trajectories that survive in the future and in the past define the backwards and forward trapped sets , respectively . in turn , the repeller is given by their intersection .",
    "the structure of this classical invariant can be very complex for chaotic dynamics , having a fractal dimension in most of the cases .",
    "another relevant property of open maps is the decay rate , which is defined as the asymptotic loss of probability in one iteration .    in this work",
    "we will study the shift and intersection families of open tribaker maps defined in @xcite that differ only in their short time dynamics , sharing the same repeller and decay rate .",
    "they are defined preserving parity symmetry , and therefore with the same openings in position and momentum .    in ternary notation",
    "the map action is given by a bernoulli shift of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( given by the corresponding trits @xmath5 ) as @xmath6 @xmath7 where the dot is moved one position to the right .",
    "shift and intersection families of open maps can be straightforwardly defined replacing the usual trit @xmath8 by the open trit @xmath9 where the value 1 is forbidden ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) . in this framework , the shift family members ( @xmath11 ) are defined with two open trits corresponding to the @xmath12-th most significant trit of both position and momentum .",
    "equivalently the intersection family members ( @xmath13 ) have the first @xmath12 trits open , both in position and momentum .",
    "the iterations of open baker maps in the unit square for @xmath14 and both , shift and intersection families are illustrated in fig.[fig:0 ] .",
    "the quantum version of the shift and intersection map families can be defined from the usual quantum tribaker map in a hilbert space spanned by @xmath15 qutrits ( with dimension @xmath16 ) @xmath17 where the antiperiodic fourier transform @xmath18 connects position and momentum eigenvectors ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 ) @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( see @xcite for quantization details ) .",

    "the shift and intersection families of open quantum tribaker maps can be straightforwardly defined as @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and where the form @xmath36 preserves the parity symmetry of the closed map .",

    "the quantum evolution is given by a nonunitary operator with right and left decaying nonorthogonal eigenfunctions .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath43 are complex numbers that fall inside the unit circle , that is , @xmath44 .",
    "the resonances are conjectured to be localized on the trapped sets @xcite .",
    "this structure of the phase space has led to the prediction of a relation between the number of long - lived resonances and the fractal dimension @xmath1 of the repeller .",
    "as previously mentioned , the fwl establishes that the number of resonances with decay factor @xmath45 $ ] scales as @xmath46 .",
    "this conjecture has been investigated in many systems , including quantum maps , 2-d and 3-d billiards , and the modified henon - heiles potential @xcite .",
    "also , more scarring has been predicted in open systems than in closed ones @xcite ; this phenomenon has deep consequences in many applications , such as microlasers @xcite .",
    "the goal of this section is to test the validity of the fwl in the families of open tribaker maps introduced earlier .",
    "we remark that all these systems have the same repeller , classical information that determines the statistical behavior of the resonances which is embodied in the fwl . in fig .",

    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "we clearly see that the ordered decay factor for this map using different hilbert space dimensions roughly behaves as in the case of the usual open tribaker map , i.e. it follows the fwl .     of the open map @xmath57 as a function of @xmath53 .",

    "the recently developed theory of short pos for open quantum maps @xcite ( which finds its roots in the corresponding theory for closed systems @xcite ) provides the ideal tool to test up to which point the repeller , more specifically the pos living in it are the actual classical support of quantum resonances .",

    "is chosen in such a way that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we select a number of short pos that approximately covers the repeller , whose number scales following the fwl prediction @xcite .",
    "then , we construct an appropriate basis in which we can write open evolution operators associated to open maps . after solving a generalized eigenvalue problem",
    "we obtain a classically motivated approximation to the system s long - lived resonances @xcite .",
    "the short periodic orbit theory is strongly relying on the repeller as the source of fundamental information in order to describe the long - lived portion of the spectra of open maps .",
    "in fact , it takes into account the details of the open dynamics on the repeller , going beyond the consideration of just a measure such as , for instance , the fractal dimension which governs the fwl .",
    "but now the question arises : is this enough ? , or are more elements needed ?",
    "we define the performance @xmath77 of this method as the fraction of long - lived eigenvalues that it is able to reproduce up to an error given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the exact eigenvalues and those given by the short pos theory , respectively .",
    "hereafter , we take @xmath81 and consider just the eigenvalues with modulus greater than @xmath82 .",
    "these threshold values guarantee good performance of the approximation and the evaluation of a meaningful number of eigenvalues in the whole range of maps that we have studied . however , if detailed comparisons are needed , these values should be carefully adapted to each map , this going beyond purposes of the present paper . in figs .",

    "it is already evident that the usual open tribaker map that corresponds to the @xmath85 value for both families proves to be well reproduced by this approximation . in the case of the shift family the good performance is suddenly lost when we arrive at the @xmath86 threshold , i.e. , from @xmath87 on , the method clearly fails .",
    "we notice that the resonances of the shift family occupy classically forbidden regions for @xmath88 @xcite . nevertheless , the performance is good for all the members of the intersection family .",
