    "the phenomenological theory of spin diffusion was first proposed by bloembergen  @xcite   and de gennes  @xcite to give a description of inelastic neutron scattering in magnetic systems at elevated temperatures .",
    "it is based on the physical argument that at high enough temperatures the modes of the system become independent and may be represented as gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the argument is independent of dimension and one of the elementary consequences of this theory is that at infinite temperature the autocorrelation of a spin which obeys a conservation law has the long time behavior in dimension @xmath2 @xmath3 this spin diffusion phenomenology is extensively used to study neutron scattering in real magnetic systems  @xcite .",
    "it is of considerable interest to demonstrate that this phenomenology follows in some degree of universality for a large class of conservative systems specified by a hamiltonian and over the years there have been a variety of arguments made for its validity  @xcite . in parallel to these investigations there has been a long series of attempts to find a system sufficiently simple to actually compute an autocorrelation function and to then see whether or not the spin diffusion behavior actually holds .",
    "most of the studies have been in one dimension where the long time dependence of  ( [ dif ] )   is @xmath4    the most studied quantum mechanical model is the spin 1/2 @xmath5 chain of @xmath6 sites with periodic boundary conditions specified by the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9 pauli spin matrix at site @xmath10 the autocorrelation functions at infinite temperature are defined as @xmath11 these correlations have been studied for the isotropic case @xmath12 by numerical and approximation methods for over 30 years  @xcite .    what is very surprising is that after so much effort the answer to the question of whether or not there is spin diffusion in the @xmath5 model has not been resolved ( see chapter 10 of  @xcite  for a detailed discussion of the situation as of 1994 ) .",
    "this is all the more surprising since the spin 1/2 @xmath5 model is the oldest known solvable spin chain .",
    "however , after decades of effort the only exact results known for the autocorrelation at @xmath0  ( [ defn ] )   are as follows :    \\1 ) the general result proven in  @xcite  ( with a mild assumption ) that the fourier transform @xmath13 of @xmath14 must diverge when @xmath15 at least as rapidly as @xmath16 and that if the asymptotic behavior  ( [ difone ] )  holds then as @xmath17 @xmath18 and    \\2 ) the results specific to @xmath19 that  @xcite @xmath20 ^ 2=\\left [ {",
    "1\\over   \\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\pi}\\cos 2 t \\sin \\theta d\\theta\\right]^2 \\label{nem}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the bessel function of order zero and  @xcite @xmath22    the total spin component @xmath23 will only commute with @xmath24 if @xmath12 and hence in general depends on time . thus @xmath25 is not expected to have spin diffusion behavior for @xmath26 however @xmath27 does commute with @xmath24 and hence does satisfies the conservation law needed for spin diffusion . nevertheless for large @xmath28",
    "we see from  ( [ nem ] )  that @xmath29 behaves as @xmath30 \\label{exass}\\ ] ] which is certainly not of the form  ( [ difone ] ) .    in the absence of exact computations recourse",
    "has been made to a variety of speculations .",
    "for example  @xcite  it may be argued that the reason the xxz model is solvable in the first place is because it possesses an infinite number of conservation laws and that this violates the assumption of independence of modes used in  @xcite .",
    "this would argue that there is no reason that there should ever be spin diffusion in the model .",
    "one can also attempt to gain inspiration from low temperature and field theory limit computations . as far back as",
    "@xcite   and most recently in  @xcite , it is argued that at low temperature there is no spin diffusion for @xmath31 where there is no long range order at @xmath32 .",
    "however from a low temperature computation of sachdev and damle  @xcite  it can be argued that for @xmath33 where there is long range order at @xmath34 spin diffusion will hold .",
    "thus , as a possibility , it can be suggested that for the spin@xmath35 @xmath5 model there could be a nonanalytic behavior at @xmath12 such that at @xmath0 there would be spin diffusion for @xmath36 and no spin diffusion for @xmath37    in this paper we assess the merits of these suggestions by an extension of the work of  @xcite .",
    "in particular for a spin chain of size @xmath38 we compute exactly by diagonalizing the finite size matrices the spin correlation functions  ( [ defn ] ) .",
    "these results are given in sec .",
    "we then analyze these results in sec . 3 in terms of the ansatz on the long time behavior of  @xcite  and",
    "conclude with a discussion in sec .",
    "4    the conclusion of this analysis as given in tables 1 and 2 is that we do indeed see evidence for @xmath39 that spin diffusion does not hold .",
    "indeed it is consistent with our data that as @xmath40 @xmath41 which is the same as the ballistic behavior of the @xmath19 ( free fermion case ) .",
    "moreover at @xmath12 we find strong evidence supporting the behavior @xmath42 which is neither ballistic nor diffusive .",
    "this result is in agreement with the estimate of  @xcite  that @xmath43 diverges as @xmath44 as @xmath45 for @xmath36 we can not be so positive as to whether or not spin diffusion exists and we defer further discussion to the end of sec .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath14 for chains up to size @xmath38 using the methods of exact diagonalization presented in @xcite .",
    "we plot our results for @xmath46 in steps of @xmath47 in fig .",
    "1 . the results presented here extend the previous work principally in that data is used which range over a larger time interval and many more values of @xmath48 have been studied .",
    "data on finite size systems will only well approximate infinite size systems for some finite time interval . in @xcite",
    "the criteria used was that the data for @xmath49 and @xmath38 should closely agree .",
    "this amounts to using the @xmath38 data to tell us how much of the @xmath49 data can be used .",
    "however the @xmath38 data will agree with the @xmath50 curve for a longer time interval .",
    "we estimate this larger interval in two ways .",
    "first by comparing the exact result  ( [ nem ] )   for @xmath19 with the finite size result for @xmath51 the second is by making an extrapolation using the data for @xmath52 and @xmath53 we make these comparisons in fig .",
    "2 for @xmath54 this allows us to effectively extend the range of @xmath28 from @xmath55 which was what was used in @xcite  to @xmath56 or greater in some cases .",
    "the maximum time is estimated for each @xmath48 separately since with the normalization of ( [ ham ] )   the maximum time will decrease as @xmath48 increases .",
    "it is possible to introduce a normalization which makes @xmath57 relatively independent of @xmath48 but since this is somewhat _ ad hoc _ and arbitrary we will not do this here .",
    "we have also made a similar study for the correlation @xmath58 these results are presented graphically in fig .",
    "3 .    there are two qualitative features of these graphs which should be noted .",
    "first of all in the graph for @xmath25 the long time behavior of @xmath12 lies higher that all other values of @xmath48 .",
    "this is expected from fact that if @xmath12 then @xmath59 and thus the long time behavior must be algebraic which is to be contrasted with the exponential decay expected for all other values of @xmath48 where there is no conservation of @xmath60 however near @xmath61 the curves for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are so very close that this change in asymptotic behavior can not yet be seen in the data .    the other point to note is that in the fig1b we see clearly that near @xmath64 there is crossing of curves for @xmath65 this effect is real and is not an artifact of the size @xmath51 we interpret this as evidence that if @xmath66 then @xmath28 must be greater than @xmath67 before the true long time asymptotic regime is seen . in other words",
    "we take this as evidence that there is a crossover in the system .",
    "in order to analyze the existence of spin diffusion we must extract the long time behavior of the correlation function  @xmath68 it is obvious from fig.1 that for times up to @xmath69 that there are oscillations in the data and that a simple power law will not be adequate to describe the results . here",
    "we confront this problem by fitting the curves with an extension of the simple ansatz proposed in  @xcite  which incorporates a decaying oscillation as well as a decay with an arbitrary power law @xmath70 .",
    "\\label{fit}\\ ] ] in figs .",
    "4,5 and 6 we illustrate this fitting procedure by showing a least squares fit of @xmath71 to the function obtained from the @xmath38 data of fig.1 @xmath72 for the values @xmath73 and @xmath74    more systematically we present in table 1 the parameters of the form  ( [ fit ] )   which best fit all the data with @xmath38 presented in fig . 1 and the time intervals over which the fit is valid .",
    "in table 2 we give the corresponding fitting parameters and time intervals for the data with @xmath75 we note from  ( [ exass ] ) that at @xmath19 the exact values of the parameters are @xmath76    it is very instructive to compare the values of the fitting parameters as obtained in the two tables . for @xmath19 and @xmath77 the values of @xmath2 changes little in going from @xmath49 to @xmath51 but this is not the case for all values of @xmath48 and we compare the cases @xmath49 and @xmath38 in fig .",
    "first of all we see that for @xmath78 there is a great deal of variation in @xmath2 as we go from @xmath49 to @xmath51 we interpret this as an indication that there is a crossover in the behavior from small to large times .",
    "we expect that as @xmath6 increases this trend will continue for all @xmath79 and eventually the data for @xmath80 will be affected also .",
    "we can not definitively say from these plots what the true value of @xmath2 will be for @xmath81 but because the fitted value of @xmath2 is increasing in our tables for @xmath82 we conclude that the spin diffusion value of @xmath35 is never attained . at @xmath12 the value @xmath83 is seen to be quite stable and we note that to within our accuracy it is equal to @xmath84 from our analysis @xmath2 could either be a continuous function of @xmath48 at @xmath12 or we could have @xmath85 for @xmath86    for @xmath87 we can not be so positive in our conclusion . for @xmath88 the fitted values of @xmath2 do indeed decrease as @xmath6 goes from 14 to 16 and it is not out of the question that as @xmath81 the limiting value could be 1/2 for all values of @xmath89 however this is not mandated by our results .",
    "the conclusion of the previous section is that in the spin 1/2 xxz model specified by  ( [ ham ] )  there is no spin diffusion for @xmath90 this needs to be discussed both as to its correctness and its implications .",
    "we first acknowledge that it is possible to make contradictory suggestions as to what is to be expected and that different authors seem to implicitly start from different conceptions of what is going on .",
    "for example the authors in the mid sixties speak of their work as the hydrodynamic approximation and thus is sometimes said to be inapplicable to one and two dimensions where the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function diverges .",
    "this would argue that one dimension always needs a separate treatment .",
    "however , most of the more recent authors seem to write as if the diffusion form ( [ difone ] )  is to be expected in one dimension if only in the fact that deviations from it are called `` anomalous . ''    indeed , the question of whether or not this anomalous diffusion occurs in the classical one dimensional heisenberg model has been a subject of some controversy in the past 10 years  @xcite .",
    "it is agreed by all that for times up to about 50 an exponent of @xmath91 can be obtained from computer simulations . what is controversial is the ultimate long time behavior .",
    "the arguments are summarized in  @xcite .",
    "what is important for us here is to note that for the spin 1/2 quantum mechanical case it is not possible with current computing power to go to anything approaching the large time of these classical computations .",
    "thus all speculations and conjectures about the long time behavior of the spin 1/2 model are subject to the proviso that we assume that times up to @xmath69 are able to teach us about the true @xmath40 behavior .",
    "it is our belief that the integrability of the spin 1/2 xxz chain will rule out the possibility of a new time scale appearing for large times but there is no way of verifying this short of an exact computation .",
    "if it is accepted that the estimate of the asymptotic behavior we have presented here is indeed correct for the model ( [ ham ] )  it must then be asked whether or not this is generic in any sense .",
    "it is here that the question of the relation of an integrable to a generic system needs to be addressed .    in the first place",
    "there is ample computer evidence  @xcite  that if a sufficiently strong next nearest neighbor interaction is added to  ( [ ham ] )  then the level spacing statistics will change from poisson for  ( [ ham ] )  to those of the goe ensemble of random matrices .",
    "it thus might be supposed that this will change the long time behavior of the correlation functions .",
    "we have indeed looked at this in the @xmath38 system but find that the asymptotic behavior up to time @xmath69 does not change .",
    "but , of course , this proves little or nothing since if a scale is opened up at larger times the @xmath38 system can hardly be expected to see it .",
    "it is certainly possible that all the complications seen in the classical system can occur for the non integrable quantum spin chain if we could go to large enough times .",
    "this is the place where ideas of quantum chaos should be able to intersect many body condensed matter physics .",
    "we also comment further on our suggestion of nonanalytic behavior at @xmath92 it is of course perfectly reasonable that at t=0 there will be a marked difference in the physics of @xmath93 and @xmath89 in the first case there is no long range order and no gap in the spectrum while in the second case there is both long range order and a gap in the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "it is exactly these qualitative differences which feature in the low temperature computations of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "but at high temperature it seems unreasonable that such low temperature properties as whether or not there is a gap in the excitations above the ground state should make any difference .",
    "it would seem that to maintain that there is nonanalytic behavior at  @xmath12 we must violate our physical intuition .",
    "the resolution to this would seem to lie in the integrability of ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "indeed the thermodynamics have been studied by means of the thermodynamic bethe s ansatz method and a set of two coupled nonlinear integral equations has been derived  @xcite   whose solution gives the free energy at all @xmath94 these integral equations have the feature that they do take two distinct forms depending on which of the two regimes @xmath48 lies in . in a more picturesque fashion we can say that the integrability of the model extends the low temperature description in terms of particles to all temperatures . for this reason we expect that the dynamics at infinite temperature of the spin 1/2 xxz model are not generic .",
    "the study of the crossover from integrable to generic behavior as next nearest neighbor interactions are added would constitute a major step towards formulating what should be called a quantum kam theorem .",
    "such a theorem would go a long way towards clarifying the status of diffusion at high temperatures in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "finally we remind the reader that because of the integrability of the spin 1/2 xxz chain it is firmly to be expected that the time dependent correlations studied in this paper can be exactly evaluated .",
    "we hope that the numerical results presented here will stimulate the analytic solution of this problem .",
