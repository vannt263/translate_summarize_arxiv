    "beautiful experiments on transport and noise in normal metal - superconducting ( ns ) hybrids allow probing the microscopic physics associated to the superconducting condensate and quasi - particles . for instance , the superconducting gap @xmath3 was revealed by tunnel spectroscopy on a normal metal - insulator - superconductor tunnel junction . in ns structures with highly transparent contacts , andreev reflection",
    "@xcite is the phenomenon by which pairs of electron - like quasi - particles from the normal electrode n can enter the superconductor s and join the condensate .",
    "additional processes appear in n@xmath4sn@xmath5 structures with two normal electrodes n@xmath4 and n@xmath5 : an electron coming from n@xmath4 may be transmitted as an electron into n@xmath5 ( elastic cotunneling , @xmath6 ) , or it may be transmitted as a hole into n@xmath5 ( crossed andreev reflection , @xmath2@xcite ) .",
    "the amplitudes of these two processes decrease exponentially with a characteristic length scale : the coherence length @xmath7 , which is inverse proportional to the energy gap @xmath3 in the ballistic limit",
    ". therefore , three - terminal nanoscale devices with distance @xmath8 between the contacts are especially interesting : conductance and noise experiments on them probe both the condensate and the quasi - particle states .    concerning current - current correlations ,",
    "theorists have envisioned two kinds of experiments for the long term : using entanglement in quantum information devices , and testing entanglement in the electronic einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) experiment.@xcite the epr experiment is not considered here , but instead the basic problem of current - current cross - correlations @xcite in nsn structures is addressed .",
    "some experiments based on nisin structures have been reported recently.@xcite our task here is not to understand the tunnel limit , where an insulating oxide layer i is inserted in between the normal and the superconducting electrodes , but the opposite limit of highly transparent interfaces where coulomb interactions @xcite are not expected to play a predominant role .",
    "based on the limiting case of tunnel contacts,@xcite one may erroneously conclude that positive differential current - current cross - correlations @xmath0 are equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "however , this is not the case because , as we show , positive @xmath0 can well be obtained in the absence of @xmath2 .",
    "current - current cross - correlations are negative @xcite for non - interacting fermions .",
    "a flux of bosons leads to positive cross - correlations @xcite and negative cross - correlations are found for bosons impinging one by one onto a beam splitter.@xcite cross - correlations can be positive in interacting fermionic systems , @xcite as well as in multiterminal ns structures.@xcite    the recent experiment @xcite and other experiments under way involve normal electrodes separately connected to a superconductor , @xcite with a geometry similar to that considered in the following . not only the noise can be evaluated in various set - ups , but also the full histogram of the charge transmitted in a given time interval . @xcite",
    "in addition to these set - ups , relevant information is also obtained from `` zero dimensional '' chaotic cavities in contact with a superconductor , in connection with the possibility to observe positive current - current cross - correlations due to @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite    in what follows , attractive interaction binding pairs of electron - like quasi - particles is present everywhere in the superconducting region .",
    "two electron - like quasi - particles of a pair injected into the superconducting region remain glued by the bcs mean field interaction , in contrast with the dissociation of a cooper pair entering a chaotic cavity ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the physics behind current - current cross - correlations in the nsn structure with highly transparent contacts considered here was not really elucidated in ref .  , in spite of the important observation that @xmath0 is positive but the non - local conductance is negative at low bias .",
    "unusual properties can be realized with the following experimental conditions : first it is assumed that the same voltage @xmath9 is applied on the two normal electrodes n@xmath4 and n@xmath5 .",
    "second the temperature is very low , and third high values of interface transparencies are used .",
    "direct electron transmission is pauli blocked at zero temperature because of the same voltage applied on the two normal electrodes . on the other hand , crossed andreev reflection is strongly reduced at high transmission , regardless of the applied voltages @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these two features of @xmath6 and @xmath2 are shown to be a sufficient condition for deducing @xmath12 , not due to @xmath2 , but due to what is called here _ synchronized andreev reflection and inverse andreev reflection _ ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the positive current - current correlations at high transparency are not in disagreement with what is found in ref .   for strong coupling to the superconductor , where a gap is induced in a chaotic cavity .",
    "the cross - over between high values of interface transparency and tunnel contacts will also be investigated : @xmath2 has a dominant contribution to @xmath0 for tunnel contacts , and @xmath0 is negative at the cross - over for intermediate values of interface transparency , where @xmath1 is suppressed .    the article is divided into two independent main sections where current - current correlations are evaluated on the basis of ( i ) the scattering approach for a homogeneous superconducting gap ( see sec .",
