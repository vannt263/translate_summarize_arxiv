    "the sensitivity of second generation gravitational wave detectors such as advanced ligo  @xcite and advanced virgo  @xcite will be limited by the thermal noises of the test masses  @xcite , therefore the gravitational wave community is involved in research into methods for reducing the effects of this noise .",
    "one proposed method for thermal noise reduction is to use so called ` flat beams ' in the main interferometer , in place of the currently standard fundamental lg@xmath1 beam  @xcite .",
    "this method is currently investigated for possible upgrades of second generation detectors  @xcite , as well as for third generation detectors  @xcite .",
    "flat beams provide wider intensity distributions for the same optical losses and can therefore average better over the mirror surface distortions caused by the thermal motions .",
    "a number of different flat beam shapes have been proposed , such as mesa beams  @xcite , conical beams  @xcite and higher - order lg beams  @xcite .",
    "one advantage of higher - order lg beams over the other flat beams is their potential compatibility with the currently used spherical mirror surfaces . for this reason",
    "we find it worthwhile to further investigate the compatibility of higher - order lg beams with gravitational wave interferometer technology .",
    "some of us recently showed that the potential detection rate of binary neutron star inspiral systems with the advanced virgo detector could be increased by a factor of 2.1 if the lg@xmath0 beam was used in place of the lg@xmath1 beam  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the thermal noise benefits , the wider intensity distributions of higher - order lg beams have been shown to reduce the magnitude of thermal aberrations of optics within the interferometers  @xcite .",
    "this would reduce the extent to which thermal compensation systems are relied upon in future detectors to reach design sensitivity",
    ". the improved thermal noise characteristics of higher - order lg beams over the fundamental beam also makes the technology a strong candidate for improving the sensitivity of optical clock experiments , which currently also approach the mirror thermal noise limit  @xcite .",
    "an investigation using numerical simulations , into the sensing and control signals for length and alignment with a lg@xmath0 beam in advanced detectors also yielded positive results , indicating that the lg@xmath0 beam performed as well if not better than the lg@xmath1beam in all of the examined criteria  @xcite .",
    "we present the results of an experimental follow - on study into the interferometric performance of higher - order lg beams , in order to assess how much of the potential for sensitivity improvement is realizable in practice .",
    "the first crucial test for the interferometric performance of lg@xmath0modes is their compatibility with mode cleanertechnology .",
    "we show that the mode cleaner effect works equivalently for the lg@xmath0mode as for the lg@xmath1mode in a linear optical resonator as depicted in figure  [ fig : lgmode - lin - cav ] .",
    "we also demonstrate the non - compatibility of helical lg modes with three mirror mode cleaners .",
    "gauss modes represent a complete set of solutions to the paraxial wave equation , and as such are well suited to modeling the eigenmodes of spherical optical resonators  @xcite .",
    "there is some lack of consensus in current literature about the exact naming of lg mode functions .",
    "much of the literature relating to higher - order lg modes refers to modes with spiral phase fronts , which carry orbital angular momenta @xmath2 per photon , where @xmath3 is the azimuthal mode index  @xcite .",
    "equation  [ eqn : lghxamp ] shows in cylindrical polar coordinates the normalized form of the complex amplitude of this mode set , which in the following will be referred to as _ helical _ lg modes .",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the radial mode index , @xmath3 is the azimuthal mode index , @xmath6 is the gouy phase , @xmath7 is the beam radius , @xmath8 is the wavenumber and @xmath9 is the complex gaussian beam parameter .",
    "@xmath10 are the associated laguerre polynomials",
    ". an alternative form of lg modes with a sinusoidal amplitude dependence in azimuthal angle can be used equally well .",
    "the normalized form of the complex amplitude of this mode set is shown in equation  [ eqn : lgcosamp ] ; we will refer to this mode set as _ sinusoidal _ lg modes .",
    "the symbols are as defined in equation [ eqn : lghxamp ] , and @xmath11 is the kronecker delta .",
    "@xmath12    a complete set of sinusoidal solutions consists of the functions as given in equation  [ eqn : lgcosamp ] using @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 .",
    "higher - order lg modes of both sets offer improvements in thermal noise for gravitational wave interferometers compared to the lg@xmath1mode , however the advantage is greater for the helical modes than for the sinusoidal modes  @xcite .",
    "a number of different methods for generating higher - order lg modes have been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "however , so far the optimization of higher - order lg beam sources has largely been in a different direction to that which is required by the gravitational wave detector community . for example",
    "the use of lg beams in the cold atoms and optics fields often requires high - speed manipulation of the beam parameters and positions , whereas the use of lg modes in high - precision interferometry depends on mode purity and stability .",
    "one of the leading candidate methods for the latter is the use of diffractive optics , or _ phase plates _ for conversion from a lg@xmath1mode to a higher - order lg mode , due to their stability , as well as potentially high conversion efficiency and output mode purity . other conversion methods",
    "include using computer generated holograms  @xcite , spatial light modulators  @xcite and astigmatic mode converters  @xcite",
    ". however , none of these mode conversion methods are perfect , and some light inevitably remains in unwanted modes .",
    "an effectively pure and stable higher - order lg mode light source for gravitational wave interferometers can possibly be achieved with the implementation of _ mode cleaner cavities_.    in practice , mode cleaners take the form of medium- to high - finesse optical resonators which are feedback controlled to remain on resonance for a chosen laser mode  @xcite .",
    "mode cleaners are used in several locations in gravitational wave interferometers  @xcite .",
    "so - called _ pre - mode cleaners _ are used in the initial frequency stabilization chain of the laser .",
    "these typically employ small , monolithic spacers in air .",
    "the beam then passes the _ input mode cleaners _ , suspended optical cavities in vacuum whose main function is to filter beam geometry fluctuations ( also called beam - jitter noise ) .",
    "modern laser interferometers also include optical cavities in the main interferometer , which act as additional mode cleaning cavities .",
    "often a small in - vacuum output mode cleaner is then used to filter the light leaving the interferometer before it reaches the photo detectors .",
    "mode cleaners can in principle be used to increase the spatial purity of any gaussian mode .",
    "experimental verification of the compatibility of higher - order lg beams with mode cleaner technology is of paramount importance for determining the future prospects for lg beams in gravitational wave interferometers .",
    ".input mode cleaner parameters for some gravitational wave detectors , as well as those used in this work .",
    "tem@xmath17 suppression factors and throughput percentages are given in terms of light power .",
    "the finesse and tem@xmath17 suppression factors of the mode cleaners used in this work were chosen to be lower than those of the large - scale mode cleaners . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the transmitted beam was to 99% in a single mode we were able to make an accurate estimate of the input mode purity by comparing the throughput of the lg@xmath0modes to that of the lg@xmath1mode .",
    "once the intrinsic optical losses of the mode cleaner cavity were taken into account , we estimated the input mode purity to be 51% for the sinusoidal lg@xmath0beam , and 66% for the helical lg@xmath0beam . it should be noted that examples of higher - order lg modes with mode purities likely to be above 70% have been created previously directly with slms using a more thoroughly optimized conversion procedure , for example in  @xcite , although in this case the authors refrain from quoting an experimentally measured purity .",
    "however , this is the first time a purity improvement of a laguerre - gauss mode using an optical resonator to an estimated 99% has been reported in the scientific literature .",
    "the demonstrated mode purity is limited in first order by the manual alignment of the input beam and can very likely be improved using a standard automatic alignment system .    intensity pattern . from left to right : the residual for the measured input lg@xmath0beam , the residual for the measured output lg@xmath0beam , the residual for an output lg@xmath0pattern generated with a numerical model including a misalignment of the input beam to the cavity.,title=\"fig : \" ] intensity pattern . from left to right : the residual for the measured input lg@xmath0beam , the residual for the measured output lg@xmath0beam , the residual for an output lg@xmath0pattern generated with a numerical model including a misalignment of the input beam to the cavity.,title=\"fig : \" ] intensity pattern . from left to right : the residual for the measured input lg@xmath0beam , the residual for the measured output lg@xmath0beam , the residual for an output lg@xmath0pattern generated with a numerical model including a misalignment of the input beam to the cavity.,title=\"fig : \" ]      in order to test the effect described in section [ sec : theory ] , whereby we expected helical lg beams to be decomposed into their consitutuent sinusoidal lg modes upon interaction with a triangular mode cleaner , we placed a cavity of the standard triangular pre - mode cleaner design  @xcite after the linear mode cleaner as shown in figure  [ fig : lg33hx - refltrans ] .",
    "the triangular mode cleaner was scanned with the sinusoidal lg@xmath0beam input and the helical lg@xmath0beam input successively .",
    "as expected , extra resonances at half a free - spectral range were observed when the input was changed from sinusoidal lg@xmath0to helical lg@xmath0 .",
    "the triangular mode cleaner was then feedback controlled in similar fashion to the linear mode cleaner , with the pdh error signal being this time obtained from the light reflected from the cavity input mirror .",
    "figure  [ fig : lg33hx - refltrans ] shows images of the input , transmitted and reflected beams at one of these resonances ( the beam after the linear cavity was of slightly lower quality than that shown in figure  [ fig : modepics ] as less time was spent on the alignment optimization for this experiment ) .",
    "we observed that the beam transmitted through the triangular cavity was nearly a vertically symmetric sinusoidal lg@xmath0mode .",
    "the stronger vertical central section compared to the one shown in figure  [ fig : modepics ] is caused by astigmatism due to the curved end mirror  @xcite .",
    "the reflected beam was a superposition of all the modes rejected by the mode cleaner , and was therefore of lower mode purity than the transmitted mode .",
    "however , the vertically anti - symmetric lg@xmath0mode can be seen to be the dominant mode present in the reflected light .",
    "mode through a triangular mode cleaner , showing the intensity pattern of the beams at various locations in the setup ( note that the images shown here are contrast enhanced to show the pattern more clearly ) .",
    "from left to right : helical lg@xmath0after the slm , helical lg@xmath0after transmission through the linear mode cleaner , beam reflected from the triangular cavity and beam transmitted through the triangular cavity.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the measurement was repeated for the alternative resonance point , where as expected the dominant type of the transmitted and reflected mode was reversed .",
    "the helical input beam is decomposed into the constituent sinusoidal modes upon interaction with the triangular mode cleaner , as predicted .",
    "we therefore conclude that in order for helical lg@xmath0modes to be compatible with gravitational wave interferometers , the mode cleaners used must be linear , or at least be comprised of an even number of mirrors .",
    "if helical laguerre - gauss beams are to be implemented in second generation detector upgrades or third generation detectors , this result shows that at the very least a redesign of the mode cleaners from the first and second generation detectors will be necessary , since these are currently triangular cavities .",
    "as mode cleaners are present in gravitational wave interferometers in several places , this constitutes a significant consideration for the overall optical design of the detectors for which lg mode technology is considered .",
    "research into the interferometric performance of lg modes is important for the gravitational wave community , as lg modes offer a thermal noise advantage over the fundamental lg@xmath1mode that can improve the sensitivity achievable by future detectors  @xcite .",
    "simulations have already shown promising results for the interferometric performance of lg modes  @xcite .",
    "this article provides experimental verification for some of these predictions : we have demonstrated the generation of a pdh error signal from a linear mode cleaner injected with both helical and sinusoidal lg@xmath0modes equivalent to the error signal obtained with a lg@xmath1mode .",
    "we used this error signal to successfully demonstrate longitudinal control of the linear mode cleaner cavity at resonance for the lg@xmath0mode ; a vital technique for the operation of gravitational wave interferometers with lg@xmath0modes .",
    "we also showed an increase in the purity of a sinusoidal lg@xmath0mode from 51% to 99% upon transmission through a linear mode cleaner , demonstrating that very high - purity lg@xmath0mode light sources can be produced in this way .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated the decomposition of a helical lg@xmath0mode into the constituent sinusoidal lg@xmath0modes with a triangular mode cleaner ; a result which has a strong impact on the choice of the optical design of future detectors .",
    "the prospects for lg modes in gravitational wave detectors remain intact following the investigation described in this paper . in the future",
    "we will expand this work to use lg modes in systems that combine michelson interferometers and resonant cavities , and also include alignment control systems .",
    "the requirements for mirror surfaces for high finesse systems with lg modes also needs further investigation to move scrutiny of the interferometric performance of lg modes to the next level , towards a possible implementation in future gravitational wave detectors .",
