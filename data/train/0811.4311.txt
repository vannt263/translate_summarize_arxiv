    "gravitational wave emission from spheroidal , rapidly rotating , isolated nss has long been considered in the astrophysical literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "a natural origin of this distortion can be the anisotropic pressure from the internal magnetic field .",
    "however , before the early nineties , the inferred magnetic fields of nss were @xmath5 g , which implied tiny deviations from spherical symmetry and , thus , weak gw emission that would be detectable , in principle , only from the nearest sources and with years - long observations @xcite .",
    "+ the discovery of the soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) ( cfr .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) led to the idea that these peculiar high - energy sources could be ultramagnetized nss , magnetars , with external ( dipole ) fields in the @xmath6 g range and with internal fields at least one order of magnitude stronger ( @xcite , duncan & thompson 1992 , dt92 hereafter , thompson & duncan 1993 , 1995 , 1996 , hereafter @xcite , respectively ) . the core of the proto - neutron star ( pns ) experiences a phase of neutrino - driven turbulent convection ( during a few tens of seconds ) .",
    "strong differential rotation is also present if the nascent ns is spinning at millisecond period ( we indicate the initial spin , in milliseconds , as @xmath7/ms ) , providing a total free energy reservoir of up to @xmath8 erg .",
    "the combination of these two factors can power an @xmath9 dynamo that acts coherently over the whole ns core @xcite .",
    "a seed magnetic field is twisted into a mainly toroidal configuration and its intensity amplified to values @xmath10 g. the total energy available from the core differential rotation corresponds to a maximum field of @xmath11 g @xcite .",
    "millisecond spin periods are required for differential rotation to play an important role and to achieve magnetic field coherence lengthscales comparable to the stellar radius . in more slowly rotating nss differential rotation",
    "is almost negligible and a convection - driven , @xmath12-type dynamo results that acts stochastically and leads to a much weaker large scale field @xcite . in this formation scenario , magnetars represent those nss that are born very rapidly rotating , at @xmath13 3 ms spin period .",
    "+ as the magnetar model received increasing support from observations during the last decade it was shortly after realized that such objects at birth represent promising sources of gws , because of their large magnetic deformation and rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "these early suggestions assumed that a simple dipole field extended throughout the ns and its magnetosphere thus causing ns deformation and magnetodipole spindown .",
    "first highlighted the crucial role of the internal field structure in the gw emission efficiency of a magnetically distorted ns .",
    "he pointed out that a ns with a strong internal toroidal field has a prolate shape and would thus provide the best chance of being a strong gw emitter .",
    "conversely , gw emission from a ns with an oblate distortion ( such as that caused by a dipole field ) would be rapidly quenched , since such an object would tend to spin around its symmetry axis ( see @xmath14 [ earlyspindown ] ) .",
    "based on the energetics and likely recurrence time of giant flares such as the dec 27 event from sgr 1806 - 20 , @xcite derived a lower limit of @xmath15 g for the strength of the core magnetic field in this object .",
    "this suggests that internal fields of magnetars may be even stronger than previously thought , reaching the @xmath2 g range .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , based on the apparent lack of giant flare - like events in the batse archive , suggest longer recurrence times for such events , thus reducing the minimum energy requirement proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , the correlation between short grbs and local galaxies found by @xcite leaves room for a fraction of such events to be associated with a population of young nss .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that , if the thermal emission observed from axps is indeed powered by the decay of a magnetar s b - field , then the field strength in the ns crust must be @xmath10 g. + fields @xmath10 g would imply remarkably large ( prolate ) magnetic deformations , @xmath16 ( see @xmath14 [ ellipticity ] ) which , in turn , would make gw emission at birth from such objects strong enough to be detectable up to the virgo cluster distance , with advanced ligo / virgo - class detectors . the integrated magnetar formation rate in virgo is estimated to be @xmath1 1 per year ( @xcite ) , as opposed to @xmath17 per year in the galaxy alone ( @xcite ) , thus making newly formed magnetars potentially interesting sources for next generation gw detectors , with a fairly high rate of occurence . + as an alternative scenario",
    ", it was proposed that strongly magnetic nss can form as a direct result of magnetic flux conservation during core - collapse of a massive star with unusually strong magnetic field ( @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this picture , magnetars need not be born rapidly rotating : their magnetic field is stronger than in ordinary nss because the magnetic dipole moment of their progenitor stars was particularly large .",
    "@xcite have shown that a population of nss with dipole fields up to @xmath18 g can be obtained in this framework starting from a realistic galactic population of high - mass , high - field stars .",
    "we note , however , that the upper end of their field distribution seems to fall short of the minimal requirement within the magnetar model .",
    "internal fields of _ at least _",
    "several times @xmath19 g are needed both to explain the overall energy output of sgrs and axps ( @xcite , thompson & duncan 2001 , hereafter @xcite ) , and to make the magnetic field decay timescale comparable to , or shorter than , the estimated ages ( @xmath20 yrs ) of these sources @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite have shown that a field amplified to magnetar - strength in a newly formed ns will survive an early unstable phase ( and subsequent dissipation ) only if the ns spin period is shorter than @xmath1 5 ms , thus reinforcing the case for fast spins at birth .",
    "+ if magnetars are born with millisecond spin periods ( hereafter millisecond magnetar ) , their initial spin energy will be @xmath21 erg .",
    "here and throughout we assume a typical radius of 12 km and a mass of 1.4 m@xmath22 .",
    "the spindown timescale through magnetic dipole radiation will be very short , @xmath1 one day for external dipole fields in the @xmath23 g range .",
    "most of the initial spin energy would thus be rapidly transferred to the surrounding supernova ejecta @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also shown that , for newly formed magnetars with dipole fields in excess of @xmath24 g and spin period of @xmath25 1 ms , strongly magnetized , relativistic winds are produced which can carry away most of the initial spin energy in a matter of minutes , thus opening the possibility of an even faster transfer of energy to the ejecta @xcite . in both cases , present - day snrs around known magnetars should bear the signature of this larger - than - usual energy injection . for initial spin periods less than 3 ms , the injected energy would be @xmath26 erg , making these remnants significantly more energetic than those surrounding ordinary nss .",
    "+ the x - ray spectra of the snrs surrounding known magnetar candidates ( two apxs and two sgrs ) have been analyzed by @xcite who found that the total energy content of the ejecta in these remnants does not appear to be different from the energy in remnants surrounding common nss ( @xmath27 erg ) .",
    "this result implies that either these nss were not born rapidly rotating , thus challenging the @xmath9 dynamo scenario , or their initial spin energy must have been lost without appreciably energizing the surrounding ejecta .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility that most of the initial spin energy of millisecond magnetars is realeased through gravitational radiation .",
    "they concluded that , in order to account for the constraints derived by @xcite , the internal toroidal field at birth should be in the @xmath2 g range , consistent with the inference by @xcite for the field strength in sgr 1806 - 20 and , by extension , magnetars in general .",
    "a similar conclusion about strong gw - driven spindown in newly formed magnetars was reached by @xcite , based on a totally independent argument .",
    "+ @xcite have also studied the possibility that the huge spin energy of a millisecond magnetar is promptly released in the form of a highly collimated wind , if the external ( dipole ) field exceeds @xmath19 g. the wind breaks through the surrounding supernova ejecta and produces a grb - like event without directly energizing the ejecta . however , the currently estimated magnetar formation rate exceeds the rate of observed grbs by 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "hence , this process can involve at most a tiny fraction of newly formed magnetars @xcite .",
    "+ thus , a number of astrophysical arguments point to possible field strengths in the @xmath2 g range in magnetar interiors and suggest a possibly relevant role of gw emission in the early evolution of these objects .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the physical consequences of this hypothesis and draw a state - of - the - art scenario , in light of all approximations and uncertainties .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in @xmath14 [ earlyspindown ] we introduce the model for the early spindown of a magnetar subject to both magnetodipole and gw torques and study the main factors determining the gw emission efficiency of a newly formed magnetar . in @xmath14 [ detect ] we calculate the expected energy loss through gw emission from newly born magnetars as a function of the relevant ns parameters and re - address the problem of signal detection already discussed by @xcite .",
    "finally , in @xmath14 [ decayrate ] we address the problem of the thermal and magnetic evolution of nss , extending previous treatments of field decay to field strengths @xmath10 g.",
    "a newly formed ns with a strong toroidal magnetic field has a prolate deformation induced by the field ( @xmath28 , defined in @xmath14 [ ellipticity ] ) with symmetry axis along the magnetic axis . if the magnetic and spin axes are misaligned , with tilt angle @xmath29 , the angular velocity vector ( @xmath30 ) precesses ( in the ns frame ) around the fixed angular momentum vector ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) studied the precession dynamics taking also into account the effects of the centrifugal deformation of the ns .",
    "they showed that the triaxial ellipsoid behaviour is , in this case , formally equivalent to that of a biaxial rigid body , as far as the precessional motion is concerned . if @xmath32 represents the moment of inertia of the spherical ns , the eigenvalues for the distorted ns are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 represents the centrifugal deformation . since the latter term affects all eigenvalues in the same way it does not enter explicitly in the precession dynamics , which are determined only by the magnetic deformation ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "hence , the focus here and in the following will be on the magnetic deformation only .",
    "the spin energy of a rotating spheroid is minimized , at fixed angular momentum , when its moment of inertia is maximum . for a prolate figure , this is achieved when the symmetry axis is orthogonal to the spin axis . in the presence of internal dissipative processes , the magnetic axis of a prolate ns will thus be driven towards orthogonal rotation @xcite , which maximizes the efficiency of gw emission @xcite .    for arbitrary @xmath29",
    ", gws will be emitted at both the spin frequency and its octave , with a total rate of energy emission ( cfr . @xcite and references therein )",
    "@xmath36 an orthogonal rotator emits gws only at twice its spin frequency , at the rate given by eq .",
    "( [ generalgw ] ) with @xmath37 @xmath38 given the generation mechanism for the superstrong internal field , the magnetic axis is expected to be just slightly tilted , initially , to the spin axis and , for small @xmath29 , the gw luminosity is largely suppressed ( eq .",
    "[ generalgw ] ) . given the efficiency of magnetodipole radiation at birth , the orthogonalization process must thus be quick enough for strong gw emission to ensue promptly , in order to be competitive with magnetodipole radiation .",
    "strictly speaking , the spindown luminosity of a magnetic dipole rotating in vacuo depends only on the magnitude of the dipole component orthogonal to the spin axis .",
    "however , according to the standard pulsar model , an aligned rotator is expected to have a spindown luminosity comparable to that of an orthogonal rotator .",
    "studies on the structure of force - free ns magnetospheres suggest that this is indeed the case , within a factor of order unity @xcite .",
    "based on these results , we assume a newly formed magnetar to have the magnetodipole luminosity of an orthogonal rotator . further discussion of these issues is delayed to @xmath14 [ evaluating ] .",
    "we neglect here the effects of strongly magnetised winds from newly formed magnetars spinning at @xmath25 1 ms period and restrict our attention to external dipole fields @xmath39 g. although such winds can be extremely efficient in carrying away angular momentum ( and spin energy ) from the ns in just a few minutes , their efficiency is expected to be negligible for dipole fields weaker than @xmath40 g @xcite .",
    "+ to summarize , we describe the early spin evolution of a newly born magnetar as being driven by both magnetodipole and gw torques . hence , as the tilt angle @xmath29 increases , a sufficiently large ( prolate ) deformation and rapid initial rotation can make gw emission dominate angular momentum and rotational energy losses . for a given spindown torque , @xmath41 ,",
    "the corresponding spindown timescale is @xmath42 . for convenience , in the following",
    "we express the relative strength of the two torques at birth in terms of the ratio : @xmath43 where @xmath44 ; gw losses are dominant for @xmath45 .    the complete spin - down equation we adopt is thus : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is given by ( [ generalgw ] ) , or by ( [ gwemission ] ) when @xmath48 .",
    "we consider here in some detail the very first stages when the prolate ns is formed , its symmetry axis being just slightly tilted to the spin axis .",
    "we focus in particular on those processes that might affect the orientation of the symmetry axis and thus promote ( or prevent ) prompt and strong gw emission .",
    "as stated above , freebody precession of the prolate spheroid is eventually damped by internal viscous torques , which redistribute angular momentum ( with no loss ) inside the ns so as to minimize the spin energy .",
    "following the analysis of @xcite , @xcite assumed that internal ( viscous ) dissipation of free precession occurrs on a ( very short ) timescale @xmath49 p@xmath50 @xcite , where p@xmath50 ( @xmath51 few seconds ) is the free precession period .",
    "this estimate results from the crust - core coupling caused by the interaction between superfluid neutron vortices and relativistic electrons in the ns core , where only electrons follow the instantaneous rotation of the crust .",
    "the application of this prescription to a newborn ns is subject to important caveats : neutron pairing in a @xmath52 state in the core occurs at a temperature t@xmath53 k ( @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) and crust formation also occurs at a temperature @xmath1 a few @xmath54 k. the coupling mechanism studied by @xcite does not apply when t @xmath55 t@xmath56 , since there is no superfluid and , likely , not even a proper crust .",
    "the ns is more like a self - gravitating , rapidly rotating , fully degenerate fluid mass .",
    "a proper account of its early cooling is thus of crucial importance in this context .",
    "if direct urca processes occurr in the densest parts of the core , then cooling is extremely fast due to the very large neutrino luminosity .",
    "the ns temperature drops to @xmath57 k in a matter of minutes , as opposed to @xmath1 1 yr in the case of modified urca cooling ( cfr .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . therefore , if newly born magnetars cool through direct urca processes , crust formation and transition to superfluidity in the core occur very quickly .",
    "the crust - core coupling mechanism described by @xcite could thus operate soon after ns birth and lead to the very short orthogonalization time estimated above .    in the opposite limit , when ns cooling is driven by only the modified urca reactions",
    ", the evolution is more complex .",
    "the temperature in this case evolves as ( @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) @xmath58^{-1/6}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 1 yr and @xmath60 k is the initial temperature of the ns at the end of the @xmath9 dynamo phase @xcite . as we are interested in the cooling at t @xmath55 t@xmath56 , no further neutrino - emitting reactions are considered , such as those occurring at t@xmath25 t@xmath56 in the so - called `` minimal cooling scenario '' ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ coolinghistory ] ) , the ns temperature will reach a value @xmath61 k in about 5 days after formation . during this time",
    ", the crust - core coupling mechanism introduced by @xcite can not operate . in the absence of other viscous processes , the prolate spheroid will thus not be orthogonalized and gw emission will remain highly suppressed during those early days .",
    "therefore magnetodipole radiation by a @xmath23 g external field will carry away most of the initial spin energy , thus spoiling the possibility of significant gw emission also at later times .",
    "however , the prolate ns is subject to at least two further ( and competing ) mechanisms that can in principle alter the orientation of its symmetry axis .",
    "first , gws will be emitted even for a small initial tilt angle @xmath62 , though at a small rate .",
    "the corresponding radiation reaction torque will cause the spin and magnetic axes to align , regardless of whether the spheroid is oblate or prolate @xcite .",
    "this process always acts so as to quench the gw emission efficiency .",
    "+ on the other hand , freebody precession induces internal motions in the newly formed , fluid ns , that are required by the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "dissipation of these internal motions through bulk viscosity is potentially able to orthgonalize the symmetry axis of the spheroid ( the magnetic field axis ) relative to the angular momentum vector , thus increasing the efficiency of gw emission .",
    "+ the relative strength of these two mechanisms will thus determine the early evolution of the angle @xmath29 and the possibility of newly formed magnetars to become efficient gw emitters .",
    "below we study these two processes in more detail , showing that orthogonalization through bulk viscous damping is expected to always prevail on radiation reaction , in the parameter range of interest to our work .      for our aims",
    ", the equation of state ( eos throughout ) of ns matter enters through its role in determining the global structural properties of the ns , such as the mass - radius relation and the moment of inertia .",
    "we dot not consider the detailed microphysics that determine the eos ; rather we adopt a phenomenological approach , parametrizing all results in terms of the ns mass and radius .",

    "@xmath65 is determined by the stellar radius ( see appendix [ appendixb ] ) .",
    "we also adopt the approximate formula for the ns moment of inertia given by @xcite : i@xmath66 g @xmath67 . finally we note that , as discussed in @xcite , internal magnetic fields weaker than @xmath68 g are not expected to sizeably affect the microphysics that determine the eos . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also report here the resulting relation between the measured @xmath69 and @xmath70 of a ns and the corresponding magnetic field strength as derived by the magnetodipole spindown formula ( see eq .",
    "[ pdot ] ) .",
    "@xmath71      one of the key parameters of interest is the deviation from spherical symmetry ( @xmath28 ) of the ns , that is caused by the anisotropic pressure of the internal magnetic field .",
    "this determines the frequency of freebody precession and the gw luminosity of the rapidly spinning ns . in general ,",
    "@xmath28 will be determined by the volume - integrated ratio of the magnetic to gravitational binding energy densities , times some numerical coefficient accounting for field geometry and ns structure . setting the latter factor to unity , and assuming an approximately constant density in the ns core @xmath72 as determined from general arguments based on the virial theorem ( @xcite and references therein ) . in the above definition ,",
    "the integral is extended to the whole ns volume where the magnetic field is present .",

    "@xcite studied the way in which the numerical factor in eq . ( [ epsilonb ] ) changes for different configurations of the internal magnetic field .",
    "these authors showed that this factor can be higher than 15/4 , or even much higher , for specific magnetic field geometries ( for example the case of an internal field that is mainly concentrated in an outer shell of the ns core , or the case of an intermittent field distribution rather than a uniform one ) .",
    "@xcite studied the same problem allowing for different eos s and combinations of the toroidal and poloidal components of the internal field .",

    "three separate processes for secular field evolution were identified two of which , ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion , are dissipative while the third , hall drift , conserves magnetic energy .",
    "in particular , ambipolar diffusion was found to be more sensitive to the field intensity ( gr92 ) which in fact implies that , while this process is not very important in normal nss , it is the main mechanism for direct field decay in magnetars ( td96 ) .",

    "based on stability arguments , these authors suggested that the solenoidal mode is expected to carry just a small fraction of the magnetic energy , most of it being tapped by the irrotational mode .",
    "the main conclusion of this scenario is that only a tiny fraction of the magnetic energy reservoir in the ns core is lost either in the high - t regime , or via field decay through the solenoidal mode at lower temperatures .",
    "most of the magnetic energy dissipation occurs via the slow decay of the irrotational mode , at @xmath227 .",

    "@xcite conclude that heat is most likely released in the outer regions of the crust , where neutrino - emitting processes are much less efficient and heat is thus most efficiently transported to the surface , with only minor losses .",
    "their results are therefore at variance with ours , that envisage an efficient heating of the core up to very high temperatures ( as a function of the magnetic field strength ) .",
    "the difference bewteen the two conclusions is readily found in the parametrization of the heating source chosen by @xcite , which corresponds to a different physical scenario .",
    "their model heat source is independent on the magnetic field strength and on the ns internal temperature .",
    "the maximum initial heating rate they consider ( q@xmath262 erg / s ) effectively corresponds to our expression ( [ heatirrot ] ) with b@xmath263 g. the heating rate in their model decreases exponentially in time , with a fixed time constant comparable to , but somewhat longer than , the source estimated age . + as opposed to this , we have @xmath264 allowed for initially stronger fields and , thus , larger heating rates and @xmath265 considered a time - varying decay timescale , since the ambipolar diffusion - driven field decay is a function of the ns internal temperature and field strength ( eq . [ heatirrot ] ) . in particular , the values of t and b at each epoch are determined self - consistently by the equilibrium condition between cooling and heating .    as a consequence , in the model by @xcite",
    "the released heat does not affect the value of q while it enhances neutrino emission .",
    "the latter being a strong function of the temperature , the net result is a slight enhancement of the interior temperature , to make neutrinos able to carry away almost all the eccess heat .    in ambipolar - diffusion driven field decay , on the other hand , heating has a feedback on both cooling _ and _ heating itself .",
    "as long as the temperature is very high the ns cools , with heating providing just a minor perturbation to the dominant process of @xmath266-cooling .",
    "as the core temperature drops , however , the field decay rate grows ( eq . [ heatirrot ] ) while neutrino emission drops .",
    "eventually , the two rates become almost equal and at this stage their equilibration plays a key role , as stressed by @xcite .    near equilibrium ,",
    "temperature variations have a strong feedback on both heating and cooling - and with opposite effects .",
    "this forces the temperature toward t@xmath233 ( eq . [ equilibriumt ] ) : as the field dissipates the temperature drops slighlty and a new equilibrium between heating and cooling is reached , at a slightly smaller temperature and field strength .",
    "the equilibrium temperature within the ns core , as a function of density , obtained through our eq .",
    "( [ equilibriumt ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "( [ coretemp ] ) for four different values of the average core magnetic field strength . in fig .",
    "( [ corevolve ] ) we show , for a given initial magnetic field strength , the equilibrium temperature throughout the magnetar core at four different epochs of its evolution according to eq .",
    "( [ evolvet ] ) .",
    "more details are given in the caption .",
    "+ therefore , the internal heating source considered by @xcite differs from ambipolar diffusion - driven field decay .",
    "when ambipolar diffusion in the core - and the associated heating - is taken into account , the ns core can remain at fairly high temperatures for a long time _ if the decaying field is around @xmath10 g_.",
    "in this paper we have investigated some implications of one of the key ansatz of the magnetar model ; namely , that magnetars do form with millisecond spin periods and a ( mainly ) toroidal magnetic field , generated through the strong differential rotation of the collapsing proto - neutron star ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "building on our earlier work ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we showed that one major implication of this scenario is that such objects can become strong sources of gws in the first few days after formation .",
    "this results _ if _ there exists at least a tiny misalignment ( angle @xmath29 ) between the rotation axis and the symmetry axis of the magnetic field , at birth .",
    "the newly born ns is distorted to a prolate shape by the toroidal field , and is freely precessing because of @xmath267 . under these circumstances",
    "internal viscous dissipation of the precessional motion will drive the magnetic symmetry axis orthogonal to the spin axis , the most favourable geometry for gw emission .",
    "we discussed current uncertainties in various aspects of the model and introduced simple approximations to treat each of them .",
    "we developed a simple analytical model describing the early rotational evolution of newly formed magnetars , that includes an ideal magnetic dipole torque plus the gw torque acting on an orthogonal , prolate rotator ( see eq .",
    "[ pdot ] ) .",
    "we then estimated the magnitude of gw emission from magnetars s as a function of their initial spin , internal magnetic energy and external ( dipole ) magnetic field ( as well as their mass and radius ) .",
    "+ our main conclusions can summarized as follows :    * if magnetars are born with spin period less than 3 ms , internal toroidal fields @xmath268 g and external dipole fields @xmath269 g then the expected gw signal would be strong enough to be detectable with advanced ligo / virgo class detectors out to the virgo cluster , where their formation rate may be @xmath1 1 per year ; * the estimated optimal s / n ratios for match - filtered signal searches ( with one detector only ) are very encouraging .",
    "however , as already noted by @xcite , optimal signal searches have unaffordable computational costs .",
    "the developement of sub - optimal signal search strategies is required , a task that is currently under way . *",
    "if our scenario holds , the rotational energy @xmath270 ( p / ms)@xmath271 ergs of the newly formed magnetar will be emitted mostly as gws , in the first few days after formation . as a consequence , supernova remnants ( snrs ) surrounding evolved magnetars",
    "would not be expected to bear the signature of an excess energy injection ( @xmath272 erg ) soon after formation , since gws do not interact appreciably with the expanding shell .    in particular , the condition that a newly formed magnetar be detectable as a gw source from virgo - cluster distances turns out to be almost equivalent to the condition that it radiate less than @xmath273 erg through magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "the two requirements are met for nearly overlapping regions of the internal and external magnetic fields parameter space . stated differently ,",
    "if the galactic magnetar candidates studied by @xcite were born with millisecond spin periods , b@xmath274 g and b@xmath275 , they would have lost most of their rotational energy through gw emission .",
    "their snrs would thus not show any excess energy compared to other snrs - as observed , indeed - _ and _ the gw signal they emitted could have been detected out to @xmath1 20 mpc with advanced ligo / virgo class interferometers . finally , we considered the evolution of an internal field @xmath276 g as a result of ambipolar diffusion , as already envisaged by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our aim here was twofold : first , we investigate this high b - field regime , for which the calculations by @xcite are not appropriate .",
    "second , we showed that even fields this strong have ( at least ) a slow decay mode through ambipolar diffusion , that is active soon after formation .",
    "this process can prevent the cooling of the magnetar core below a temperature of @xmath236 k for hundreds to thousands years .",
    "this conclusion is expected to have significant implications for our understanding of axps / sgrs .",
    "we give here a quick derivation of the expression for the energy of freebody precession of a fluid star subject to both centrifugal and magnetic deformations . a more general discussion , in the context of `` ordinary '' nss ,",

    "<S> we present a state - of - the - art scenario for newly born magnetars as strong sources of gravitational waves ( gws)in the early days after formation . </S>",
    "<S> we address several aspects of the astrophysics of rapidly rotating , ultramagnetized neutron stars ( nss ) , including early cooling before transition to superfluidity , the effects of the magnetic field on the equilibrium shape of nss , the internal dynamical state of a fully degenerate , oblique rotator and the strength of the electromagnetic torque on the newly born ns . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our scenario is consistent with recent studies of snrs surrounding axps and sgrs in the galaxy that constrain the electromagnetic energy input from the central ns to be @xmath0 erg @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that if this condition is met , then the gw signal from such sources is potentially detectable with the forthcoming generation of gw detectors up to virgo cluster distances where an event rate @xmath1 1/yr can be estimated ( stella et al . 2005 ) . finally , we point out that the decay of an internal magnetic field in the @xmath2 g range couples strongly to the ns cooling at very early stages , thus significantly slowing down both processes : the field can remain this strong for at least @xmath3 yrs , during which the core temperature stays higher than several @xmath4 k.
