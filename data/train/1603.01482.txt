    "the search for superconductors with increasingly higher @xmath14 has started with the discovery of kamerlingh onnes@xcite , who on april 08 , 1911 observed the electrical resistance of pure mercury vanish at liquid @xmath15 temperature of @xmath5 .",
    "after the 1986 discovery of superconductivity in perovskite - type oxides by bednortz and mueller@xcite , a new age in the quest for room temperature superconductivity has begun . in a short span of time till 1993 , the critical temperature increased up to @xmath16 , in materials under external pressure . as these events are well known to the community , we will refer the reader to the excellent reviews and analysis of the observed phenomena@xcite .",
    "other very recent advancements worth mentioning are in systems at extremely high pressures@xcite .    as many others , our group started working on high - temperature superconductivity in 1987 .",
    "some of the topics we have been interested in are listed in the references@xcite .",
    "the present author was active on the broad subject@xcite , and continued working on the synthesis of various superconductors over the years .    in this communication",
    "we focus our attention on novel superconductor materials we have synthesized and characterized with transition temperatures in the range of @xmath17 degrees and even well above , because of their obvious importance .",
    "below we present experimental results for selected samples of these materials obtained in the previous century , marked as type * a , b , c , d = e * and some recent ones .",
    "* resistance temperature dependence of the sample * a * in the range between @xmath18 and @xmath19 with a zero resistance state and a transition point at * 387k*. * ac magnetic susceptibility of a sample type * b * with intermediate critical temperature * @xmath20*. * magnetic susceptibility data from the twin sample * e * , collected during several runs on different temperatures in a quantum design system .",
    "the curves show negative susceptibility up to @xmath21 in the range from @xmath22 to @xmath3 .",
    "the system does not reach normal state due to a restriction in temperature ranges of the experimental setup .",
    "* @xmath4 data at * 4.2k * of the sample * d * that demonstrates a typical superconductors behavior in high magnetic field of up to * 12 t * and current of up to * 60a*. it proves existence of superconductivity in the twin sample to the one studied in the quantum design for magnetic susceptibility ( sample * e * ) .",
    "the interpretation of the observed curves indicates possible presence of magnetic - flux avalanches . *",
    "the gap in the energy spectrum was evaluated via measuring the tunneling current at * 300k * of a sample of the type * c*. the gap was found to be about * 15mv * in several measurements , the one shown is based on 9000 data points its lowest current being 6.49pa .",
    "the waiting time is the reason to collect larger current values at the same voltage due to the existence of parallel super - current paths in the pellet . * a josephson junction ( jj)@xcite is shown , with several other setups marking the broad range of frequencies from about * 5ghz * up to * 21thz * involved in the shapiro steps@xcite and the jj mesa - type * thz * waves generation . * * thz * waves images of coins and small washers are also displayed with tiny features indicating few * thz * waves presence .",
    "* experiments were performed by passing @xmath23 current via : a ) a superconductor tape ( black ) and simultaneously in series with b ) a copper tape of the same size and thickness at room temperature of * @xmath8 * .",
    "the copper tape started burning after about @xmath24 seconds .",
    "the technical current density was about * @xmath25 * , which is comparable with industrial high current transport superconductors .",
    "the data presented here are based on the above - mentioned samples of composite materials , of types * a , b , c , d = e * superconductors and some recently produced ones . these marked samples ( with the exception of sample * b * )",
    "are all with @xmath26 in the broad vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "other compounds with slightly higher @xmath26 were synthesized and tested but data is not presented here as they were not fully characterized . as a perspective , our decades - long studies include compositions of elements from several major groups in the periodic table , many of them with lower or higher critical temperatures , and many of them non - superconductors at all . in this exhaustive investigation",
    "we were initially guided by our theoretical ideas and practical experience in the hts materials .",
    "the details of these novel insights we have gained over our study , which have led to the current materials with room - temperature @xmath26 s , will be shared in upcoming publications .",
    "first we describe the dc resistance temperature dependence of a macroscopical sample across it and demonstrate the critical temperature @xmath26 of the transition from superconductive to normal state . in @xmath27 we show that the sample is still in zero resistance state above the boiling water temperature of * @xmath28 * and that the transition occurs at about @xmath1 or @xmath29 . the recorded data obtained from a sample of the composition * a * type group are displayed .",
    "many of the initially studied samples were compacted to form circular pellets at a pressure of about @xmath30 of about @xmath31 diameter and about @xmath32 thickness with four contacts attached made of in - ga eutectic composition .",
    "other size pellets were also pressed at a pressure of @xmath33 and studied .",
    "the temperature was measured with a platinum @xmath34 thermometer attached to the sample inside the sample holder .",
    "there were two other thermometers and a heater built in our standard closed cycle cryostat with lowest temperature of 10k .",

    "in this section we show data from a sample with a different composition * b * type , as a milestone mark , studied among many others on the way toward the above * 100 c * superconductors presented in the first section .",
    "the magnetization temperature dependence is the second fundamental characteristic of the superconductor state , which together with the resistance makes the two observations proving the presence of superconductivity in a macroscopical sample .",
    "the magnetization of a sample of * b * type composition was studied in the same closed cycle cryostat described in section [ sec1 ] , with a standard three - coil system .",
    "the coils were calibrated with a sample of @xmath40 producing strong signal of the lock - in amplifier operating at a frequency of @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 sample was otherwise not specifically characterized . from the graph in @xmath43",
    "we clearly observe that the amplitude of the transition signal variation of the sample having a transition temperature of @xmath2 is of the same magnitude as the @xmath40 system used for calibration .",

    "all measured samples in the susceptibility setup were cut in an approximately rectangular 2x2x4 mm shape .",
    "a typical discrepancy of about @xmath44 was observed of the critical temperatures of the cooling and warming regimes due to the position of the coil and the thermocouple above the cooler .",
    "this difference is absent if the thermal stabilization is applied at every few degrees .",
    "the number @xmath2 was selected as the last point before the sharp increase due to the transition from a superconductor state to a metallic type of resistance .",
    "this set of data displayed in the graph below is included here to show that the room temperature superconductors ( * rts * ) were found in a process including synthesis of a large amount of various superconductor compositions with intermediate transition temperatures .",
    "before presenting the data demonstrating the magnetic susceptibility , we are posting a photo of a * rts * sample positioned on a @xmath47 diameter @xmath48 based permanent magnet with magnetic field in the center of about @xmath49 as with any diamagnet ( i.e. copper ) , the superconductor sample is attracted to the magnet , but being placed in the center of its surface , strong surface super - currents are created shielding the interior of the sample from the magnetic field . if the field is between the first and second critical magnetic field values there may be partial penetration in the form of fluxoids - single flux quanta ( or a bunch of them ) , which could be forming a regular or irregular abrikosov lattice@xcite . in our case",
    "there are two stable positions of the disk of about @xmath50 diameter : one is horizontal and the other is vertical . in the horizontal position the sample ,",
    "barely laying on the surface , slides away from the strongest field to the edge as a place with highest gradient of the field . in the vertical position it also tends to escape the center and floats to the edge at a tiny distance above ( or below",
    "if suspended ) the magnet surface . as it is presented in @xmath51 , around halfway to the edge , the * rts * disk stays slightly tilted and it may stay tilted , or oscillate like a metronome .",
    "and about @xmath52 tick is on the surface of a 3 inch diameter permanent magnet with a @xmath53 field in the center . ]",
    "the magnetic field effect on some substances is to induce a small attractive force , which is measured with the diamagnetic susceptibility , studied here in order to find the magnitude of the induced diamagnetic polarization .",
    "the data were collected from a sample * e * type .",
    "the data show only the characteristic for superconductors negative susceptibility in the range between @xmath22 and @xmath3 , as the transition to a normal metallic state has not been reached since it takes place at higher temperatures , close to or above @xmath54 .",
    "the data demonstrate sensitivity in the vicinity of the transition to the normal state .",
    "there is a smaller value of the susceptibility at @xmath21 at @xmath3 , when nearing the transition point ( in the range of @xmath54 ) as demonstrated in @xmath55 by the less negative magnetization at @xmath3 , when compared to the @xmath8 curve .     to @xmath3 show a transition from paramagnetic to diamagnetic behavior at room temperatures and higher .",
    "an upturn begins to show at @xmath3 .",
    "the same sample was in superconductor / diamagnetic state at @xmath5 and @xmath6 magnetic field from @xmath56 up to @xmath57 current(see sec.5 ) ]    the samples * d",
    "* and * e * type were two different pieces of a larger one with a specific synthesis history and with critical transition temperature close to @xmath54 - a temperature not available in the measuring system from quantum design used in the experiment .",
    "next we show a @xmath58 graph @xmath59 of the actual recorded data points .     to @xmath3 show a transition from paramagnetic to diamagnetic behavior starting at @xmath22 and seen at room temperatures and higher .",
    "an upturn begins at @xmath3 . ]",
    "the transition back to normal state is in the range of @xmath54 and could not be reached by the system .",
    "we show also a 3d graph , where the data points are connected with yellow surface .",
    "the zero magnetization is marked with a blue plane .",
    "the paramagnetic to diamagnetic transition is seen @xmath60 at the crossing lines of the two surfaces - yellow and blue one .     to @xmath3 show in blue a transition from paramagnetic to diamagnetic behavior from @xmath22 to room temperatures and higher .",
    "an upturn of the yellow surface begins to show at @xmath3 the normal state being in the 400k range ]    for a superconductor sample with higher @xmath14 the second critical magnetic field is expected to be much higher then @xmath61 and for this reason a direct downturn transition at lower temperatures ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) was not observed ( it was found that 12 t at 4.2k turn it in diamagnetic state - see sec.5 ) .",
    "we first present all the data in a single graph to show the specific for this sample features at low magnetic field .",
    "for all curves , one of the loops near @xmath64 magnetic filed shows a small initial part of diamagnetic susceptibility expanded here@xmath65 to demonstrate it .",
    "all graphs present a peculiar behavior showing a transition from positive magnetization to a negative one . except for the @xmath66 and @xmath63 all pass another zero becoming negative as seen in the first graph before reaching @xmath21 . to make clear how the loop is recorded we mention that for the @xmath22 run it starts at @xmath45 negative , is positive near zero , turns negative at smaller negative values of @xmath67 ,",
    "then is positive for negative @xmath68 and returns to zero being negative i.e. near zero the sample is diamagnetic @xmath65 coming from negative values and paramagnetic from positive values of @xmath67 .",
    "it can be stated with certainty that at higher then @xmath21 field there will be a downturn at @xmath62 and @xmath63 due to the existing superconductivity of the same sample at higher magnetic fields(see next sections ) .     to @xmath3 show a transition from diamagnetic to paramagnetic in the low magnetic fields region near the origin from @xmath62 to room temperatures and higher . ]",
    "further , at @xmath22 and all higher temperatures up to @xmath3 , all curves have negative magnetization showing a low - temperatures diamagnetic behaviour , then a paramagnetic magnetization is seen and again downturn diamagnetic at higher magnetic fields , which stays diamagnetic up to @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , one can trace various lines of transitions in the zero magnetization @xmath69 plane , if the data points are connected to form a 3d surface ( see the 3d graph ) .",
    "the @xmath70 of the twin samples * d * and * e * could be related to the transition from diamagnetic near @xmath71 to paramagnetic and later again diamagnetic as seen on the 3d graph .",
    "it remains to demonstrate that there are samples with transition temperatures higher then the one shown of @xmath1 and we will give further such records of the magnetization .",
    "when the samples of the * d * and * e * types are overheated above the * @xmath72 * in a room temperatures environment to about @xmath73 ( well above @xmath14 ) the magnetization undergoes successive transitions from a superconductor state at room temperature to a non - superconductor one if over - heated well above @xmath14 and well above the boiling point of the water - like @xmath73 .",
    "the critical current of sample * e * ( same as * d * ) was studied in liquid he @xmath5 and a high magnetic field of @xmath6 .",
    "these results are listed next .",
    "the previous graph was of sample * e * showing the magnetization being negative in up to @xmath21 magnetic field and up to @xmath3 temperature .",
    "here we study its twin sample * d * in high magnetic field of @xmath6 under strong dc current sweep in a heavy experimental setup used for industrial samples serial testing .",
    "the sample was in liquid helium at @xmath5 at all times ( because of the experimental setup to reach and maintain the high magnetic field ) with attached 4 high current contacts of @xmath74 composition and the field of * 12 t * was applied continuously . from @xmath75 it can be observed that for currents up to about @xmath57 the sample was in a superconductor state . comparing this observation with the data of the quantum design magnetic susceptibility we come to the conclusion that the * 12 t * high field was enough strong to overturn the positive susceptibility to negative one in liquid @xmath15 .",
    "this observation is _ proving our conjecture _ from the previous section that the transition at the origin of the * 3d * graph was starting from a superconductor and became a paramagnetic metal driven by the increase of the magnetic field and with further increase will become again diamagnetic . in the @xmath4 curve we observe a sharp current variation with a remarkable decrease of the current @xmath75 .",
    "it is probably due to magnetic flux avalanches , when the magnetic field penetrates the sample .",
    "next we will show that samples with high critical temperature similar to the * d , e * types are undergoing transitions from superconductor to normal state in the range of @xmath54 temperatures .",
    "the energy spectrum gap ( the energy necessary for breaking the pairs ) is an important characteristic of any superconductor . here we report the experimental data from sample * c * type measured at * 300k*. the tunneling @xmath4 curve of a sample type * c * with contacts was measured with a keithley pico - amper meter and the data collected were at a very close range between each other .",
    "the sample was a pellet of about * 1.26 cm * diameter and about * 3 mm * thick with * 4 * gold contacts evaporated parallel to each other .",
    "the lowest current measured was @xmath76 .",
    "because of the relatively long collection time at any fixed voltage several larger values of the current were collected along parallel super - current pathways at this particular voltage .",
    "it clearly demonstrates superconductivity of the sample at @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.9 ] ) since the local resistance was evidently zero @xmath77 .",
    "data points show presence of a tunneling gap in the sample at * 300k * of about * 15mv * as seen in the inset .",
    "the vertical current jumps at fixed voltage values are similar to the zero voltage current jump in the josephson junctions and show presence of zero resistance in the sample at any fixed voltage @xmath78 as seen from @xmath79    .",
    "[ fig.9 ]    a remark about the near zero values of the current at voltages outside the gap is due and it is evidently related to the super - current parallel pathways mentioned about the vertical current lines .",
    "more can be said and some theories accounting for it may be mentioned later if there is interest in these phenomena ( not restricted to the presented graphs ) .",
    "in this section we will present several @xmath4 s of various samples and other characteristics verifying the superconductivity at @xmath80 and higher temperatures .",
    "we show the room temperature @xmath4 @xmath81 of a mesa - type josephson junction ( jj)@xcite of a size of @xmath82 acting as a resonator selecting the generated frequency we observed .    .",

    "yet another , different single shapiro step is observed with the similar mesa - type of jj like the ones in the previous figure of a different frequency @xmath96 .     with a single shapiro step of about @xmath97 equivalent to a frequency of about @xmath98 at room temperature @xmath84 .",

    "waves produced the images presented below of metallic coins and washers obtained at room temperature * t = 300k*. the presence of tiny blue lines around the coins demonstrates presence of few @xmath12 waves in the spectrum of the jj mesa - type source.,width=6,height=170 ]",
    "once the cooling is not necessary to observe rts , it is enough to heat the sample and leave it to cool by itself . in an open environment this process is highly individual . with successive heating and cooling measurements of the same circuit at room temperature one can find that the sample invariably makes a very sharp jump to the smallest measured voltage of the setup . using a keithley nano - voltmeter we observed jumps to the few nano - volts characteristic for the zero resistance state for the not small current of @xmath106 .",
    "several such experiments were prepared with different samples which were heated up to temperatures larger than @xmath54 . in @xmath107",

    "the slow self - cooling effect is clearly seen in longer relaxation time.the lowest measured voltage is few nano - volts . here are presented some @xmath24 transitions to or from zero resistance state .",
    "similarly , one can reproduce successive transitions to superconductor state via magnetization measurements .",
    "the only difference is that the magnitude of the signal is zero in the non - superconductor state and is maximally negative in the zero resistance state .",
    "indeed it is visible in the next graph @xmath109 .     up to about@xmath108",
    "is left to cool in @xmath80 environment . whenever it reaches the critical temperature of few tens of degrees above @xmath110 it spontaneously jumps into zero resistance state .",
    "the sample is then heated again . ]",
    "exposition of samples and the effect of the magnet on diamagnetic objects is visible . like copper ,",
    "the superconductors are attracted to the magnets .",
    "when on the surface of the magnet strong super - currents are induced on the surface of the objects creating a repulsive force acting as well as the weight .",
    "the minimal energy position depends on the shape and the size of any diamagnetic object .",
    "left horizontally the disks tend to spring up and stay upright as seen on the photo @xmath111 .",
    "if heated above the critical temperature they remain immobile on the surface of the magnet and when cooled down to room temperature they spring up indicating a precise value of the critical temperature .",
    "this is a mechanical actuator type of sensor , which may be applied where necessary .",
    "usually the rts tend to reach the highest field gradient , which is at the edge of the cylinder .",
    "for this reason objects are hanging on the edge as it is seen on the following photographs @xmath112",
    "in the next experiment we connected two tapes in series : one made of copper and the other being a copper tape covered with a thin superconductor film ( about @xmath113 thick ) . passing a current of about @xmath23 made the copper tape burn in about @xmath24 seconds and left the superconductor intact .",
