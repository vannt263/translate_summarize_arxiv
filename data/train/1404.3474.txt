    "are favored in many literature and the symmetry energy turned out to be crucial in making the harder equations of states . on the other hand , as density increases , the fermi energy of up and down quarks ( neutrons and protons ) becomes very high and the strange quark ( hyperon ) should come in because the introduction of one more quark degree of freedom can reduce the total energy of the system .",
    "the strange quark is neither light nor heavy compared to the other quarks in the density region which we are interested in . in many effective models , the strange quark has been treated separately from up and down quarks mainly due to the current quark mass differences .    in our previous work @xcite",

    "in fact , with these asymmetric mass ratios , i.e. , @xmath91 , the @xmath76 value increases with increasing density and saturates to @xmath92 as expected . this way we obtain the energy density and pressure according to eq .   and put them into the tolman  oppenheimer ",

    "the star configurations are represented by the red stars on fig .",

    "the slope of the pressure versus matter density relation does not drop as drastically as compared to the @xmath100 case after the matter transitions from two to three flavors .",
    "similar to the @xmath100 case , as the central density is increased further for these mass ratios , the three - flavor eos becomes much harder , to the point where its stiffness exceeds that with two flavors . the distinguishing point in these higher mass ratio cases",

    "as for the radii of the stars in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvr21 ] in general , we observe that they are still much larger than the realistic neutron star radii @xcite . however , since the masses are in the reasonable range , we believe that our work shows the applicability of holographic models to compact stars .",
    "in this work , we studied the effects of explicit flavor symmetry breaking due to quark mass differences on the holographic asymmetric dense matter and compact stars in the d4/d6 model . due to the fact that the d4/d6 model can easily incorporate non - zero quark masses , we assume that the model may be suitable in investigating flavor physics , especially phenomena associated with explicit flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "previous works with the d4/d6 model in asymmetric dense matter @xcite seem to support this assumption .",
