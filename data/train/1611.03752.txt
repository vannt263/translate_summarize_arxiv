    "it is difficult to follow the dynamics of quantum processes that occur in large and complex systems . yet ,",
    "often the quantum phenomena we wish to understand and study take place in such systems .",
    "both naturally - occurring and man - made systems provide examples : excitation energy transfer from light harvesting antenna molecules to the reaction center in photosynthetic bacteria and plants , electronic energy transfer processes in the semiconductor materials used in solar cells , proton transfer processes in some molecular machines that operate in the cell , and the interactions of the qbits in quantum computers with their environment .",
    "although the systems in which these processes take place are complicated and large , it is often the properties that pertain to only a small part of the entire system that are of interest ; for example , the electrons or protons that are transferred in a biomolecule . this subsystem of the entire system can then be viewed as an open quantum system that interacts with its environment . in open quantum systems",
    "the dynamics of the environment can influence the behavior of the quantum subsystem in significant ways .",
    "in particular , it can lead to decoherence and dissipation which can play central roles in the rates and mechanisms of physical processes .",
    "this partition of the entire system into two parts has motivated the standard system - bath picture where one of these subsystems ( henceforth called the _ subsystem _ ) is of primary interest while the remainder of the degrees of freedom constitute the environment or _",
    "bath_.    most system - bath descriptions focus on the dynamics of the subsystem density matrix , which is obtained by tracing over the bath degrees of freedom : @xmath0 .",
    "if such a program were carried out fully an exact equation of motion for @xmath1 could be derived and no information about the bath would be lost in this process .",
    "of course , for problems of most interest where the bath is very large with complicated interactions this is not feasible and would defeat the motivation behind the system - bath partition .",
    "consequently , the influence of the bath on the dynamics of the subsystem is embodied in dissipative and other coupling terms in the subsystem evolution equation .",
    "there are many instances where more detailed information about the bath dynamics and its coupling to the subsystem is important .",
    "examples are provided by proton and electron transfer processes in condensed phases or biological systems . as a specific example , consider the proton transfer reaction in a phenol - amine complex , @xmath2 , when the complex is solvated by polar molecules ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ptransfer ] ) .",
    "the proton transfer events are strongly correlated with local solvent collective polarization changes .",
    "subtle changes in the orientations of neighboring solvent molecules can induce proton transfers within the complex , which , in turn , influence the polarization of the solvent .",
    "the treatment of the dynamics in such cases requires detailed information about the dynamics of the environment and its coupling to the quantum process .",
    "it is difficult to capture such subtle effects without fully accounting for dynamics of individual solvent molecules in the bath .     of the phenol - amine complex ( left )",
    "is unfavorably solvated by the polar solvent molecules .",
    "this induces a proton transfer giving rise to the ionic form @xmath3 ( right ) .",
    "subsequent solvent dynamics can lead to solvent polarization that favors the covalent form and the reverse proton transfer . ]    when investigating the dynamics of a quantum system it is often useful and appropriate to take into account the characteristics of the different degrees of freedom that comprise the system .",
    "the fact that electronic and nuclear motions occur on very different time scales , as a result of the disparity in their masses , forms the basis for the born - oppenheimer approximation where the nuclear - configuration - dependent electronic energy is used as the potential energy for the evolution of the nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "this distinction between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom is an example of the more general partition of a quantum system into subsystems with different characteristics .",
    "since the scale separation in the born - oppenheimer approximation is approximate , it can break down and its breakdown leads to coupling among many electronic energy surfaces .",
    "when this occurs , the evolution is no longer described by adiabatic dynamics on a single potential energy surface and nonadiabatic effects become important .",
    "nonadiabatic dynamics plays an essential role in the description of many physical phenomena , such as photochemical processes where transitions among various electronic states occur as a result of avoided crossings of adiabatic states or conical intersections between potential energy surfaces .",
    "in the examples presented above the molecules comprising the bath are often much more massive than those in the subsystem ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this fact motivates the construction of a quantum - classical description where the bath , in the absence of interactions with the quantum subsystem , is described by classical mechanics .",
    "mixed quantum - classical methods provide a means to investigate quantum dynamics in large complex systems , since fully quantum treatments of the dynamics of such systems are not feasible .",
    "the study of such open quantum - classical systems is the main topic of this review . since quantum and classical mechanics",
    "do not easily mix , one must consider the properties of schemes that combine these two types of mechanics .",
    "one such scheme , quantum - classical liouville dynamics , will be discussed in detail and its features will be compared to other quantum - classical and full quantum methods .",
    "since the quantum systems we study are rarely isolated and interact with the environments within which they reside , the investigation of the dynamics of such open quantum systems is a worthy endeavor .",
    "the full description of the time evolution of a composite quantum system comprising a subsystem and bath is given by the quantum liouville equation , @xmath5 , \\label{eq : qle}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the density matrix at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the total hamiltonian , and the square brackets denote the commutator .    introducing some of the notation that will be used in this paper , we denote by @xmath9 the coordinate operators for the @xmath10 subsystem degrees of freedom with mass @xmath11 , while the remaining @xmath12 bath degrees of freedom with mass @xmath13 have coordinate operators @xmath14 .",
    "( the formalism is easily generalized to situations where the masses @xmath11 and @xmath13 depend on the particle index . )",
    "the total hamiltonian takes the form @xmath15 where the momentum operators for the subsystem and bath are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to write the potential energy operator , @xmath18 as a sum of subsystem , bath and coupling contributions : @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian operator can be written as a sum of contributions , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the quantum subsystem hamiltonian , @xmath22 is the quantum bath hamiltonian and @xmath23 is the coupling between these two subsystems .",
    "most often in considering the dynamics of such open quantum systems one traces over the bath since it is the dynamics of the subsystem that is of interest .",
    "as noted in the introduction , a considerable research effort has been devoted to the construction of equations of motion for the reduced density matrix , @xmath24 .",
    "the redfield equation  @xcite describes the dynamics of a subsystem weakly coupled to a bath with suitably fast bath relaxation time scales , since a born - markov approximation is made in its derivation . in a basis of eigenstates of @xmath25 ,",
    "@xmath26 , it has the form , @xmath27 where the summation convention has been used .",
    "this convention will be used throughout the paper when confusion is unlikely . here",
    "@xmath28 , while the second term on the right accounts for dissipative effects due to the bath .",
    "remaining within the born - markov approximation , the general form of the equation of motion for a reduced density matrix that guarantees its positivity is given by the lindblad equation  @xcite , @xmath29 \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_j \\left ( [ \\hat{l}_j\\hat{\\rho}_s(t),\\hat{l}_j^\\dagger]+ [ \\hat{l}_j,\\hat{\\rho}_s(t)\\hat{l}_j^\\dagger ] \\right),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath30 are operators that account for interactions with the bath .",
    "in addition to these equations , a number of other expressions for the evolution of the reduced density matrix have been derived .",
    "these include various master equations and generalized quantum master equations .",
    "there is a large literature dealing with open quantum systems , which is described and surveyed in books on this topic .",
    "@xcite in such reduced descriptions information about the bath is contained in parameters that enter in the operators that describe the coupling between the subsystem and bath .",
    "also , quantum - classical versions of the redfield  @xcite and lindblad  @xcite equations have been derived .",
    "there are many applications , such as those mentioned in the introduction , where a more detailed treatment of the bath dynamics and its interactions with the subsystem is required , even though one s primary interest is in the dynamics of the subsystem . if , as we suppose here , the systems we wish to study are large and may involve complex molecular constituents , a full quantum mechanical treatment is beyond the scope of existing computational power and algorithms .",
    "currently , the only viable way to simulate the dynamics of such systems is by using mixed quantum - classical schemes .",
    "quantum - classical methods in a variety of forms and derived in a variety of ways have been used to simulate the dynamics .",
    "@xcite mean field and surface - hopping methods are widely employed and will be discussed in some detail below .",
    "mixed quantum - classical dynamics  @xcite based the on the exact time - dependent potential energy surfaces derived from the exact decomposition of electronic and nuclear motions  @xcite has been constructed .",
    "in addition , semiclassical path integral formulations of quantum mechanics  @xcite and ring polymer dynamics methods  @xcite have been developed to approximate the dynamics of open quantum systems .    in the next section the specific version of mixed quantum - classical dynamics that is the subject of this review , quantum - classical liouville dynamics , will be described .",
    "the passage from quantum to classical dynamics is itself a difficult problem with an extensive literature , and decoherence is often invoked to effect this passage .",
    "@xcite considerations based on decoherence can also be used motivate the use of mixed quantum - classical descriptions .",
    "@xcite mean - field and surface - hopping methods suffer from difficulties related to the treatment of coherence and decoherence , and these methods will be discussed in the context of the quantum - classical liouville equation , which is derived and discussed in the next two sections .",
    "some applications of the theory to specific systems will be presented in order to test the accuracy of this equation description and the algorithms used to simulate its dynamics .",
    "the first step in constructing a quantum - classical liouville description is to introduce a phase space representation of the bath degrees of freedom in preparation for the passage to the classical bath limit .",
    "this is conveniently done by introducing a partial wigner transform  @xcite over the bath degrees of freedom defined by @xmath31 with an analogous expression for the partial wigner transform of an operator @xmath32 in which the prefactor @xmath33 is absent .",

    "the kinetic energies of the light and heavy particle systems are comparable so that @xmath45 is of order @xmath46 .",
