    "looking around the world that we live in , we will find that there are complex systems everywhere .",
    "the study of these systems has become a hot research area in different disciplines such as physics , applied mathematics , biology , engineering , economics , and social sciences . in particular ,",
    "agent - based models have become an essential part of research on complex adaptive systems ( cas ) @xcite .",
    "for example , self - organized phenomena in an evolving population consisting of agents competing for a limited resource , have potential applications in areas such as engineering , economics , biology , and social sciences @xcite .",
    "the famous el farol bar attendance problem proposed by arthur @xcite constitutes a typical example of such a system in which a population of agents decide whether to go to a popular bar having limited seating capacity .",
    "the agents are informed of the attendance in the past weeks , and hence share common information , make decisions based on past experience , interact through their actions , and in turn generate this common information collectively .",
    "these ingredients are the key characteristics of complex systems @xcite .",
    "the proposals of the binary versions of models of competing populations , either in the form of the minority game ( mg ) @xcite or in a binary - agent - resource ( b - a - r ) game @xcite , have led to a deeper understanding in the research in agent - based models . for modest resource levels in which there are more losers than winners , the minority game proposed by challet and zhang @xcite represents a simple , yet non - trivial , model that captures many of the essential features of such a competing population .",
    "the mg , suitably modified , can be used to model financial markets and reproduce the stylized facts .",
    "the b - a - r model , which is a more general model in which the resource level is taken to be a parameter , has much richer behaviour .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the model and report the emergence of plateaux - and - jump structures in the average success rates in the population as the resource level is varied .",
    "we analyze the results within the ideas of the trail of histories in the history space and the strategy performance ranking patterns .",
    "the binary - agent - resource ( b - a - r ) model @xcite is a binary version of arthur s el farol bar attendance model @xcite , in which a population of @xmath0 agents repeatedly decide whether to go to a bar with limited seating based on the information of the crowd size in recent weeks . in the b - a - r model",
    ", there is a global resource level @xmath3 which is not announced to the agents . at each timestep @xmath4",
    ", each agent decides upon two possible options : whether to access resource @xmath3 ( action ` 1 ' ) or not ( action ` 0 ' ) .",
    "the two global outcomes at each timestep , ` resource overused ' and ` resource not overused ' , are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "if the number of agents @xmath7 choosing action ` @xmath6 ' exceeds @xmath3",
    "( i.e. , resource overused and hence global outcome @xmath5 ) then the @xmath8 abstaining agents win .",
    "by contrast if @xmath9 ( i.e. , resource not overused and hence global outcome @xmath6 ) then the @xmath7 agents win .",
    "in order to investigate the behaviour of the system as @xmath3 changes , it is sufficient to study the range @xmath10 .",
    "the results for the range @xmath11 can be obtained from those in the present work by suitably interchanging the role of ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' @xcite . in the special case of @xmath12 ,",
    "the b - a - r model reduces to the minority game .    in the b - a - r model",
    ", each agent shares a common knowledge of the past history of the most recent @xmath13 outcomes , i.e. , the winning option in the most recent @xmath13 timesteps .",
    "the agents are essential identical , except for the details in the strategies that they are holding .",
    "the full strategy space thus consists of @xmath14 strategies , as in the mg .",
    "initially , each agent randomly picks @xmath15 strategies from the pool of strategies , with repetitions allowed .",
    "the agents use these strategies throughout the game . at each timestep",
    ", each agent uses his momentarily best performing strategy with the highest virtual points .",
    "the virtual points for each strategy indicate the cumulative performance of that strategy : at each timestep , one * virtual point * ( vp ) is awarded to a strategy that would have predicted the correct outcome after all decisions have been made , whereas it is unaltered for those with incorrect predictions .",
    "notice that in the literature , sometimes one vp is deducted for an incorrect prediction .",
    "the results reported here , however , come out to be the same .",
    "a random coin - toss is used to break ties between strategies . in the b - a - r model , the agents in the population may or may not be connected , by some kind of network . in the case of a networked population @xcite ,",
    "each agent has access to additional information from his connected neighbours , such as his neighbours strategies and/or performance . here",
    ", we will focus our discussion on the b - a - r model in a non - networked population and report some numerical results for networked population .",
    "the b - a - r model thus represents a general setting of a competing population in which the resource level can be tuned . from a governmental management point of view , for example , one would like to study how a population may react to a decision on increasing or decreasing a certain resource in a community .",
    "will such a change in resource level lead to a large response in the community or the community will be rather insensitive ? to evaluate the performance of an agent , one * ( real ) point *",
    "is awarded to each winning agent at a given timestep .",
    "a maximum of @xmath3 points per turn can therefore be awarded to the agents per timestep .",
    "an agent has a success rate @xmath16 , which is the mean number of points awarded to the agent per turn over a long time window . the mean success rate @xmath17 among the agents",
    "is then defined to be the mean number of points awarded per agent per turn , i.e. , an average of @xmath16 over the agents .",
    "we are interested in investigating the details of how the success rates , including the mean success rate and the highest success rate among the agents , change as the resource level @xmath3 varies in the efficient phase , where the number of strategies ( repetitions counted ) in play is larger than the total number of distinct strategies in the strategy space .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath3 were first studied by johnson _ et al .",
    "these authors reported the dependence of the fluctuations in the number of agents taking a particular option , on the memory size @xmath13 for different values of @xmath3 . for the mg ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) in the efficient phase ( i.e. , small values of @xmath13 ) the number of agents making a particular choice varies from timestep to timestep , with additional stochasticity introduced via the random tie - breaking process .",
    "the corresponding period depends on the memory length @xmath13 .",
    "the underlying reason is that in the efficient phase for @xmath18 , no strategy is better overall than any other .",
    "hence there is a tendency for the system to restore itself after a finite number of timesteps , thereby preventing a given strategy s vps from running away from the others . as a result ,",
    "the outcome bit - string shows the feature of anti - persistency or double periodicity @xcite .",
    "since a maximum of @xmath18 points can be awarded per turn , the mean success rate @xmath17 over a sufficiently large number of timesteps is bound from above by @xmath19 .",
    "we have carried out extensive numerical simulations on the b - a - r model to investigate the dependence of the success rate on @xmath3 for @xmath10 . unless stated otherwise , we consider systems with @xmath20 agents and @xmath21 . figure  [ fig : w_m1m3s2 ] shows the results of the mean success rate ( @xmath17 , dark solid line ) as a function of @xmath3 in a typical run for ( a ) @xmath22 and ( b ) @xmath23 , together with the range corresponding to one standard deviation about @xmath17 in the success rates among the @xmath0 agents ( @xmath24 , dotted lines ) and the spread in the success rates given by the highest and the lowest success rates ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 , thin solid lines ) in the population .    by taking a larger value of @xmath0 than most studies in the literature , we are able to analyze the dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath13 in greater detail and discover new features . in particular , these quantities all exhibit _ abrupt transitions _",
    "( i.e. , jumps ) at particular values of @xmath3 . between the jumps ,",
    "the quantities remain essentially constant and hence form steps or ` plateaux ' .",
    "we refer to these different plateaux as states or phases , since it turns out that the jump occurs when the system makes a transition from one type of state characterizing the outcome bit - string to another .",
    "the origins of the plateaux are due to ( i ) the finite number of states allowed in each @xmath13 , and ( ii ) insensitive to @xmath3 inside each state .",
    "the success rates within each plateau ( state ) come out to the the same . for different runs ,",
    "the results are almost identical . at most , there are tiny shifts in the @xmath3 values at which jumps arise due to ( i ) different initial strategy distributions among the agents in different runs , and ( ii ) different random initial history bit - strings used to start the runs . in other words ,",
    "a uniform distribution of strategies among the agents ( e.g. , in the limit of a large population ) gives stable values of @xmath3 at the jumps .",
    "the results indicate that a community does not react to a slight change in resource level that lies within a certain plateau , but the response will be abrupt if the change in resource level swaps through critical values between transitions .",

    "it has been shown @xcite that the conditional probability of an outcome of , say , @xmath6 following a given history is the same for all histories . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the result still holds for states characterized by @xmath28 . note that a history bit - string can only make transitions to history bit - strings that differ by the most recent outcome , e.g. , 111 can only be make transitions to either 110 or 111 , and thus many transitions between two chosen nodes in the history space are forbidden . in addition , these allowed transitions do not in general occur with equal probabilities",

    "for the other states , the results reveal several striking features .",
    "it turns out that @xmath25 is simply given by the _ relative frequency _ of an outcome of @xmath6 in the outcome bit - string , which in turn is governed by the resource level @xmath3 .",
    "for example , a 0 to 1 ratio of @xmath35 in the outcome bit - strings corresponds to the state with @xmath36 . in table",
    "[ tab : tm_m3 ] , we have intentionally grouped the history bit - strings into rows according to the label @xmath37 in fig .  [",
    "fig : hs_m3 ] .",
    "we immediately notice that for every possible state in the b - a - r model , the relative frequency of each outcome is a property of the _ group _ of histories having the same label @xmath37 rather than the individual history bit - string , i.e. , all histories in a group have the same relative fraction of a given outcome .",
    "this observation is important in understanding the dynamics in the history space for different states in that it is no longer necessary to consider each of the @xmath38 history bit - strings in the history space .",
    "instead , it is sufficient to consider the four groups of histories ( for @xmath22 ) as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : hs_m3](a ) .",
    "analysis of results for higher values of @xmath13 show the same feature .",
    "for the state characterized by @xmath39 , the outcome bit - string is persistently @xmath6 and the path in the history space is repeatedly 111@xmath331 ( in the format of _ history _ @xmath33 _ outcome _ ) .",
    "therefore , the path simply corresponds to an infinite number of loops around the history node 111 .",
    "since the path is restricted to the @xmath32 node , we will also refer to this state as @xmath40 state .",
    "the system is effectively frozen into one node in the history space . in this case",
    ", there are effectively only _ two _ kinds of strategies in the whole strategy set , which differ by their predictions for the particular history 111 .",
    "the difference in predictions for the other ( @xmath41 ) history bit - strings become irrelevant . obviously , the ranking in the performance of the two effective groups of strategies is such that the group of strategies that suggest an action ` 1 ' for the history 111 , outperforms the group that suggests an action ` 0 ' . for a uniform initial distribution of strategies ,",
    "there are @xmath42 agents taking the action ` 0 ' and @xmath43 agents taking the action ` 1 ' , since half of the strategies predict 0 and half of them predict 1 . to sustain a winning outcome of 1",
    ", the criterion is that the resource level @xmath3 should be higher than the number of agents taking the action ` 1 ' .",
    "therefore , we have for the state with @xmath44 that @xmath45 and @xmath46 these results are in agreement with numerical results . for @xmath21 , @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "note that eqs .   and are valid for _ any _ values of @xmath13 .",
    "table  [ tab : tm_m3 ] shows that the states with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 have very similar features in terms of the bit - string statistics .",
    "they differ only in the frequency of giving an outcome of @xmath6 following the history of @xmath52 .",
    "note that the @xmath53 and @xmath29 histories do not occur .",
    "the results imply that as the system evolves , the path in history space for these states is restricted to the two groups of histories labeled by @xmath54 and @xmath31 .",
    "the statistics show that the outcome bit - strings for the states with @xmath55 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 exhibit only one @xmath5-bit in a period of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 bits , respectively .",
    "we refer to these states collectively as @xmath59 states , since the portion of allowed history space is bounded by the @xmath31 histories .",
    "graphically , the path in history space consists of a few self - loops at the node 111 , i.e. , from 111 to 111 , then passing through the @xmath31 group of histories once and back to 111 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hs_m3](b ) .",
    "the states with @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 involve the other groups of histories and exhibit complicated looping among the histories .",
    "we refer to them collectively as higher ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) states .",
    "the observed values of @xmath25 for @xmath64 states can also be derived by following the evolution of the strategy performance ranking pattern as the game proceeds .",
    "we summarize the main ideas here .",
    "details can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the major result is that for given @xmath13 , the values of @xmath25 in a @xmath64 state can only take on @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "taking @xmath22 for example , we have @xmath67 and hence @xmath68 .",
    "the values of @xmath25 are @xmath69 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , exactly as observed in the numerical simulations .",
    "( [ eq : wmax_z1 ] ) is a result of the collective response of the agents stemming from their strategy selection and decision - making processes , which in turn are coupled to the strategy ranking pattern . to close the feedback mechanism ,",
    "the strategy ranking pattern must evolve in such a way so as to be consistent with the path in the history space . recall that the @xmath59 states are those in which the system only visits the @xmath54 and @xmath70 histories , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hs_m3](b ) .",
    "in this situation , only @xmath71 history bits in a strategy are relevant , despite each strategy has @xmath38 entries , i.e. , strategies that only differ in their predictions for the histories which do _ not _ occur are now effectively identical . therefore , many strategies have tied performance .",
    "the key point is that a complete path of the @xmath64 states in history space corresponds to one in which there are @xmath72 turns around the @xmath32 history , i.e. , from @xmath73 for @xmath72 turns , then breaks away to visit each of the @xmath31 histories once and returns to the @xmath32 history ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hs_m3](b ) ) .",
    "the value of @xmath72 that is consistent with the condition @xmath74 turns out to be @xmath66 .",
    "we have argued that for @xmath75 , the system loops around the @xmath32 history indefinitely , since the number of agents ( @xmath76 ) persistently taking the option 1 is smaller than @xmath3 , in the large population limit . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the situation is as follows .",
    "as the system starts to loop around the @xmath32 history , the strategies start to split in performance , with the group of strategies predicting @xmath73 ( @xmath77 ) becomes increasingly better ( worse ) .",
    "there is an overlap in performance between these two groups , as a result of their predictions when the system passes through the @xmath78 histories . as the number of loops at the @xmath32 history increases , the overlap in performance decreases and the number of agents taking option 1 increases towards @xmath76 , as a result of the strategy selection process .",
    "the condition @xmath74 , thus imposes an upper bound on @xmath72 .",
    "when the number of turns at the @xmath79 history exceeds a certain value fixed by @xmath3 , the option 1 becomes the _ losing _ option and the system breaks away to the @xmath70 histories as the system makes transition from the history 111 to the history 110 .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath72 is set by the restriction that the strategies in the group predicting @xmath73 must perform better on the average than the group predicting @xmath80 , as @xmath81 . with this understanding on the allowed paths in the history space",
    ", we can evaluate the number of winners in each turn of the path and obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmax_z1 ] ) for @xmath25 , with @xmath72 being the number of loops that the system makes at the @xmath32 history and @xmath66 .",
    "we have also studied the b - a - r model in a connected population .",
    "the agents are assumed to be connected in the form of a classical random graph ( crg ) , i.e. , random network . in a crg",
    ", each node ( representing an agent here ) has a probability @xmath82 of connecting to another node .",
    "the agents interact in the following way . when an agent is linked to other agents , he checks if the strategies of his connected neighbours perform better than his own strategies .",
    "if so , he will choose the one with the highest vp among his neigbhours and then use it for decision in that turn .",
    "if not , he will use his own best strategy .",
    "we have carried out detailed numerical calculations of @xmath17 and @xmath83 .",
    "figures  [ fig : wmcrg_m3s2 ] and [ fig : wxcrg_m3s2 ] show how @xmath17 and @xmath83 depend on @xmath3 for various connecting probability @xmath82 , with the @xmath84 results corresponding to those in a non - networked population .",
    "we observe that the features of plateaux - and - jumps persist in networked populations .",
    "there are differences in the details .",
    "while @xmath25 takes on the same set of values , the threshold in the resource level ( @xmath85 ) to sustain a particular level of success rate is found to be higher in a networked population than in a non - networked one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmcrg_m3s2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : wxcrg_m3s2 ] . for a given resource level ,",
    "allowing agents to share information on strategy performance may actually worsen the global performance of the system .",
    "this is particularly clear if we inspect the results of @xmath86 in the range of @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmcrg_m3s2 ] .",
    "the addition of a small number of links will lower @xmath17 .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite in that the links enhance the formation of crowds",
    ". the situation can be quite different in a high resource limit @xmath88 , where a small number of links may actually be beneficial .",
    "the reason is that for high resource level , some resource is left unused as @xmath89 agents will not have access to a strategy that predicts the winning option . using the links , some of these agents switch from losers to winners and thus enhance the overall performance of the population @xcite",
    "we have studied numerically and analytically the effects of a varying resource level @xmath3 on the success rate of the agents in a competing population within the b - a - r model .",
    "we found that the system passes through different states , characterized either by the mean success rate @xmath17 or by the highest success rate in the population @xmath25 , as @xmath3 decreases from the high resource level limit .",
    "transitions between these states occur at specific values of the resource level .",
    "we found that different states correspond to different paths covering a subspace within the whole history space . just below the high resource level",
    "is a range of @xmath3 that gives @xmath13 states corresponding to the fractions @xmath90 , with @xmath66 .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with that obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "the paths of these states in the history space are restricted to those @xmath13-bit histories with at most one - bit of 0 and with @xmath72 loops around the 111  history .",
    "this result is derived by considering the coupling of the restricted history subspace that the system visits , the strategy performance ranking pattern , and the strategy selection process . while our analysis can also be applied to the @xmath91 states , the dynamics and the results are too complicated to be included here .",
    "our analysis also serves to illustrate the sensitivity within multi - agent models of competing populations , to tunable parameters . by tuning an external parameter , which we take as the resource level in the present work",
    ", the system is driven through different paths in the history space which can be regarded as a ` phase space ' of the system .",
    "the feedback mechanism , which is built - in through the decision making process and the evaluation of the performance of the strategies , makes the system highly sensitive to the resource level in terms of which states the system decides to settle in or around .",
    "these features are quite generally found in a wide range of complex systems .",
    "the ideas in the analysis carried out in the present work , while specific to the b - a - r model used , should also be applicable to other models of complex systems .",
    "while we have focused on the b - a - r model in our discussions , many of the underlying ideas are general to a wider class of complex systems . for example",
    ", one may regard the resource level @xmath3 as a handle in controlling a driving force in the system . with @xmath18 ,",
    "i.e. , in the mg , and the random initial distribution of strategies and random initial history , the system is allowed to diffuse from an initial node in the history space to visit all the possible histories . a deviation of the resource level from @xmath92 acts like a driving force in the history space .",
    "thus , there is always a competition between diffusive and driven behaviour , resulting in the non - trivial behaviour in the b - a - r model and its variations .",
    "for this reason , the present b - a - r system provides a fascinating laboratory for studying correlated , non - markovian diffusion on a non - trivial network ( i.e. , history space ) ."
