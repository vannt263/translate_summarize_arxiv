    "the question of the degree and efficiency of shape reversibility of solids undergoing reversible martensitic transitions@xcite is clearly of considerable technological importance considering the diverse applications of shape memory or `` smart '' materials@xcite .    the necessary criterion for a material in order to exhibit shape - memory",
    "is that the symmetry group of the product phase forms a sub - group of the parent and the transformation leads to symmetry breaking@xcite . in a recent publication",
    "we had explored the possible _ sufficient _ conditions for shape reversibility using a model system in two dimensions as a test case@xcite . in our model system",
    "it was possible to influence the nature of the transformation by tuning the parameters of the interaction potential@xcite .",
    "we found that , while a square ( @xmath0 ) to a rhombic ( in general , oblique - @xmath1 ) lattice was reversible@xcite , the transformation to the more symmetric , triangular ( @xmath2 ) lattice was not , in accordance with the conclusions of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , we found that the question of reversibility was linked to the extent and nature of plastic or _ non - affine _ zones ( nazs ) present within the transforming crystal .",
    "the positions of particles which belong to the nazs can not be obtained from a simple affine ( shear and/or scaling ) transformation of the parent lattice .",
    "we identified two kinds of nazs associated either with the non - order parameter ( nop ) ( e.g. volumetric ) strain or with the order - paramter ( op ) shear strain which transforms the square to a rhombic lattice .",
    "we argued that the @xmath3 produces only nazs of the first kind while during a @xmath4 transition , we gave indirect evidence that both kinds of nazs are likely to be produced leading to irreversibility .",
    "we concluded therefore that for reversibility it is sufficient that nazs associated with op strains not be produced . to support our claim , we showed that eliminating nazs by making the solid stronger or the system size smaller than the typical distance between nazs makes even the @xmath5 transformation reversible in apparent contradiction to ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we lend further support to this claim by investigating this problem from the point of view of a phenomenological elasto - plastic theory@xcite of the square to oblique transformation .",
    "the elasto - plastic theory has been shown earlier to reproduce the qualitative features of the results of our md simulations@xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that plasticity in the nop or the op sector may be introduced systematically and their effects observed explicitly .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "we study the reversibility of shape of a solid which is first quenched from a square into the rhombic phase , deformed by an external stress and finally brought back to the square phase ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the external control parameters are the temperature and stress .",
    "we compare the initial and final shapes of the solid and look for congruence .",
    "we show that the presence of plasticity exclusively in the nop sector does not affect shape reversibility while the presence of plasticity in the op sector triggers irreversibility in shape changes .",
    "the next section is dedicated to a quick review of our elasto - plastic theory where we discuss the formalism and how to deduce shape at each instant of time from the knowledge of strains at that instant . in section",
    "iii we present our results and we conclude in section iv indicating possible future directions .",
    "in this section we formulate our elasto - plastic continuum theory for structural transitions in solids .",
    "our theory allows us to determine the microstructure and the overall shape of a solid undergoing a square to a general oblique lattice . unlike previous work in this subject@xcite",
    "we allow for the presence of non - affine , or plastic deformations@xcite .",
    "our main assumption in what follows is that the components of the strain tensor@xcite may be additively decomposed into elastic ( affine ) and plastic parts@xcite , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the plastic strains @xmath8 represents the total contribution from , in general , space and time dependent defect fields , which , in the spirit of our continuum approach , need not be resolved into individual , microscopic defects .",
    "nevertheless , defects introduce multivaluedness in the particle displacement field @xmath9 and cause the elastic parts of the strain to violate the st . venant s compatibility condition@xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 represents the affine ( elastic ) and the plastic strain tensors respectively .",
    "note that eq.([venant ] ) implies that the _ total _",
    "strain @xmath13 does satisfy the compatibility condition .",
    "the structural transition is driven by the non - linear response of the solid to one or more components of the strain- the order parameter ( op ) .",
    "for example , for the ( @xmath14 ) transition , the order parameter strains are @xmath15 and @xmath16 while the remaining volumetric strain @xmath17 is a non - order parameter ( nop ) strain@xcite .",
    "we shall first consider the case when plasticity exists only in the nop sector .",
    "the transition is described by the following free energy functional : @xmath18 .",

    "this choice is motivated by our md simulation of a particular model solid @xcite though we do not doubt that our theory may be easily extended to the general case .",
    "the three elastic constants @xmath20 and @xmath21 define the linear elasticity of the square ( parent ) phase .",
    "the connection with external control parameters such as temperature ( @xmath22 ) is , as usual , through the temperature dependence of these coefficients especially @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the limit of stability of the square solid .",
    "reducing @xmath21 by cooling the solid stabilizes the rhombic phase ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the rest of the coefficients parametrize non - linearities and may be taken to be constants .",
    "the lagrangian is given by@xcite , @xmath25dxdy - { \\cal f}. \\label{lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain the equation of motion in the displacement fields , we need to solve the euler lagrange equation : @xmath26 the rayleigh dissipation functional @xcite @xmath27 is given by @xmath28dxdy$ ] , where the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the corresponding viscosity coefficients of the system .",
    "using eqs.([freen ] ) , ( [ lag ] ) and ( [ euler - lag ] ) , we obtain the following equations of motion for the affine strains @xmath31 and @xmath32 : @xmath33 where the `` wave '' operator @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 . since there is symmetry breaking in the space of the op strains , the dynamics of @xmath36 and @xmath32  the broken symmetry variables ",
    "is much slower than that of the affine nop strain @xmath37 .",
    "therefore @xmath37 reaches a steady state much faster compared to @xmath36 and @xmath32 and we can simplify eqs.([e1]-[e3 ] ) by assuming that @xmath37 is slaved , at all times , to the op strains @xmath36 and @xmath32 . also note that , the st . venant s compatibility condition , which in two dimensions can be explicitly written as @xmath38 may be used to eliminate @xmath36 from eqs.([e1]-[e3 ] ) .",
    "the final set of equations which therefore has to be solved to obtain the affine strains are @xmath39     as a function of the op strain @xmath32 for different values of the parameters @xmath21 and the external stress @xmath40 viz .",

    "similar dynamics is assumed for volumetric ( nop , @xmath48 ) as well as shear ( op , @xmath49 ) plasticity .",
    "the threshold stress @xmath50 is , of course , different in the two cases.,width=264 ]    [ freplot ]",
    "lastly , the dynamics of the plastic strain @xmath51 needs to be specified .",

    "the twinned microstructure obtained in this limit become identical to that seen in `` strain - only '' approaches@xcite which do not involve plasticity . on the other hand , for small values of @xmath55 , @xmath51 proliferates the entire solid and effectively _ screen _ non - local elastic interactions , completely changing the microstructure from twinned martensite to un - twinned ferrite . in this limit",
    "the coarse- graining length grows to become of the order of the system size and such microstructures can not be described within the earlier strain only theory@xcite .",
    "these results closely mimic those observed in our md simulations of the square @xmath56 oblique transformation in a model solid@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to study shape recovery following a quench- deform- reheat transformation cycle for a solid undergoing a structural transition in the presence of plasticity .",
    "we therefore need to include the effect of external stress by using a modified lagrangian , namely , @xmath57dxdy - { \\cal f } + f_xu_x + f_yu_y\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the components of the tangential forces along the @xmath60 and @xmath61 direction respectively applied at the edges of the system .",
    "the dynamical equations for the affine strains , obtained from this lagrangian are @xmath62 note that , the external shear stress @xmath63 does not affect the steady state equation for the affine nop strain @xmath37 .",
    "the phenomenological equation for the plastic strain also remains same as well .",
    "if , in addition , plasticity is associated with the op strain , @xmath40 may also give rise to plastic flow in the solid .",
    "in this work , we consider this possibility as well . in order to incorporate plasticity in the op sector",

    "having specified the dynamics of the strains , it is necessary to be able to compute the shape of the solid from the strain fields in order to investigate shape reversibility . for this",

    "as mentioned before , we look for shape reversibility at the conclusion of the following transformation protocol .",

    "1 curve ii ) .",
    "next , the product phase is deformed ( fig .",
    "1 curve iii ) with the help of an external shear strain @xmath40 .",
    "finally , the deformed system is transformed back to the parent square crystal structure ( fig .",
    "1 curve i ) .",
    "all throughout we keep track of the shape using eqs.([ux ] ) and ( [ uy ] ) .",
    "if the system returns to the square shape after heating , we conclude that the shape is reversible , otherwise not .",
    "we have performed this transformation protocol for two cases : case i- when there is only nop plasticity and no op plasticity case ii- when plasticity is present in both nop and op sector .",
    "we give below these results for the two cases , one after the other .",
    "we first consider the case where plasticity exists only in the nop sector .",
    "we need to solve eqs.([e1-dyn ] ) and ( [ e3-mod ] ) to get the desired quenched microstructure from the parent square phase .",
    "our initial values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are zero everywhere . for the plastic strain @xmath51",
    ", we assume @xmath85 at @xmath86 .",

    "the calculated shape of the quenched solid is shown in fig(3)(a)(i ) .",
    "although alternating twins are present , the overall shape of the solid continues , on an average , to be a square .",
    "we then load the microstructure using an external shear stress so that only one of the product variants is favored .",
    "the system prefers to go to a single variant in order to lower the free energy .",
    "we stop the evolution after the system has undergone sufficient deformation .",
    "the plots of the op strain @xmath32 and the affine nop strain @xmath37 is shown in fig(2)(b ) .",
    "the shape of this deformed system is shown in fig(3)(b)(i ) .",
    "having deformed the system , we transform it back to the parent phase by increasing @xmath21 ( temprature ) .",

    ", width=302 ]      we now look into a system undergoing square to rhombic transition including plasticity in the op sector as well .",
    "as before , we start with a solid in the shape of a square and in the @xmath0 phase with a delta function nop plasticity at the center of the simulation box and let the system evolve without any external stress to obtain the microstructures . the plots for the affine op strain @xmath65 and the affine nop @xmath51 are shown in fig .",
    "note that these , as well as the calculated external shape , shown in fig .",
    "3 . ( a)(ii ) , are not significantly different from those obtained in case i.    the quenched microstructure , so obtained , is then , as before , deformed with an external shear stress as in the previous case . unlike case i , however , the external deformation now has two effects .",
    "firstly , as before , the external stress favors one of the twin variants over the other and therefore alters the microstructure by changing the distribution of the variants .",
    "secondly , the external stress may cause the solid to flow , so that a part of the deformation , would now be plastic .",
    "the amount of strain which appears as the plastic strain in the op sector , of course , depends on the parameters eg @xmath89 - the threshold stress and @xmath90 - the rate of plastic strain production . in the present work ,",
    "we have used a low value of the stress threshold to over - emphasize the plastic contribution for the sake of illustration . in reality , the contribution of the plastic strain may be smaller .",
    "the plots of the affine op strain @xmath65 and the affine nop @xmath51 are shown in fig(4)(b ) .",
    "we use the obtained strains to evaluate the displacements at the boundary and hence the shape of the system which is plotted in fig(3)(b)(ii ) .",
    "the system is then transformed by increasing @xmath21 and the resulting @xmath65 and @xmath37 are plotted in fig(4)(c ) .",
    "there are remnant ( plastic ) shear strains in the system even after the solid is fully transformed so that the system fails to go back to the initial square shape as can be seen from the plot of fig(3)(c)(iii ) although the crystal structure is @xmath0 everywhere as expected .",
    "the shape of the solid is now not only determined by the affine op strain @xmath65 but also , by the plastic part @xmath66 which is not recovered on increasing @xmath21 .",
    "ultimately this contribution causes shape irreversibility .",
    "using atomistic computer simulations of a model solid , we had shown in ref.@xcite that group - nonsubgroup transformations are irreversible because plasticity is automatically generated in the op sector during such transformations in agreement with the conclusions of bhattacharya _ et al._@xcite .",
    "we showed further that if op parameter plasticity is suppressed by increasing the yeild stress or in a small system , even group - nonsubgroup transformations may become reversible . in this paper",
    ", we complete this line of reasoning by showing explicitly that for shape recovery it is _ sufficient _ that all plastic strains be associated exclusively with the nop sector of the transformation . if , on the other hand , op plasticity is present , complete shape recovery is impossible .",
    "we show this here using an elastoplastic theory where it is possible to control the detailed nature and extent of the plastic strains by varying parameters .",
    "if op plasticity is therefore `` artificially '' introduced in a group - subgroup ( @xmath91 ) the normally reversible transformation becomes irreversible .",
    "our results may be verified experimentally using shape memory alloys with known and non - trivial yeild criteria such that plasticity in either sector may be controlled independently of each other .",
    "we await such systematic studies on the effect of plasticity on shape reversibility .",
    "before we end , we would like to discuss several possible extensions of this work which we take up one by one as follows .    _ stress induced martensite : _ within our formalism it is straightforward to consider the effect of plastic deformation on stress induced martensitic transformations@xcite .",
    "stress- strain hysteresis , which can be routinely measured in such systems may show nontrivial effects due to plasticity at various spatial and temporal scales .",
    "the separate effects of nop and op plasticity should be explicit in such studies which are planned in the near future .",
    "_ scale dependent reversibility : _ reversibility of a transformation is , obviously , scale dependent .",
    "we have studied here is the question of shape reversibility , namely , reversibility at the largest scale available to the system .",
    "in contrast , complete microscopic reversibility would imply that the very positions of atoms be recovered as the transformation is reversed - an impossibility considering the identity of atoms and thermal noise . at intermediate scales , one may ask whether microstructural features are reversible or not below a certain `` irreversibility length '' .",
    "such calculations are in progress and will be published elsewhere .    _ complex dynamics and defect reorganization : _ the non uniform plastic strain fields created during the transformation are redistributed as the solid is cycled through the transformation protocol many times .",
    "it is legitimate to ask whether this distribution has a steady state and what its dynamic properties may be .",
    "defect redistribution and aging during transformation with nontrivial dynamical signatures have been observed in real systems@xcite .",
    "we plan to study such questions , as well , within our elastoplastic approach in the future .",
