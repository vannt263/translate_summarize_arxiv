    "over the last few years there has been increasing interest in the possibility of varying the fundamental constants over cosmological time - scales .",
    "this has a twofold motivation .",
    "on one side , several observations point towards the existence of a smooth dark energy component in the universe , which could be modeled via a dynamical scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite . in general , we expect such a cosmological scalar to couple with some , if not all , the terms in the matter - radiation lagrangian , thus inducing a time variation of physical masses and couplings . on the other side , recent improved measurements on possible variations of the fundamental constants",
    "are opening up the possibility of testing the theoretical models to a good degree of precision over a wide range of cosmological epochs .",
    "it should also be mentioned that , although controversial , some evidence of time variation of the fine structure constant @xmath0 in quasar absorption spectra was recently reported @xcite .",
    "the cosmological variation of fundamental constants induced by couplings with the quintessence scalar is then worth studying in order to see if such a field could be responsible for a measurable effect .    among all the possibilities ,",
    "the time - variation of the fine - structure constant is the simplest to study both from the theoretical and experimental points of view . in this paper",
    "we will then restrict ourselves to this issue .",
    "the theoretical study of a time - varying fine structure constant dates back to 1982 when beckenstein @xcite first considered the possibility of introducing a linear coupling between a scalar field and the electromagnetic field .",
    "more recently the beckenstein model has been revived , generalized and confronted with updated experimental limits @xcite .",
    "the concrete case of the quintessence scalar has been considered too @xcite . however , as we will see , most authors restrict their study to the simplest case of a linear or quadratic coupling .",
    "the possibility of reconstructing the dark energy equation of state from a measure of @xmath0-variation has also been proposed in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss a general model for the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath0 driven by a typical quintessence scenario .",
    "after briefly reviewing the most recent observational and experimental constraints on the variation of @xmath0 , we will go on to construct the theoretical framework .",
    "in particular we will consider the case of a general coupling @xmath5 ( see eq .",
    "( [ bf ] ) below ) which includes several classes of possible functions . in this way",
    "we will be able to study the dependence of the cosmological variation of alpha , @xmath4 , upon the functional form of @xmath5 and discuss the constraints imposed by present data .",
    "we will find that different cosmological histories for @xmath4 are possible within the avaliable constraints .",
    "we will also find that , webb et al .",
    "data @xcite , if confirmed , are not incompatible with oklo and meteorites constraints @xcite .",
    "comprehensive reviews about the theoretical and experimental issues connected to the time variation of fundamental constants can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the following",
    "we summarize the avaliable constraints on the time variation of @xmath6 , expressed as functions of the redshift @xmath7 ( see also fig .",
    "[ limiti ] ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the value measured today .",
    "\\(1 ) the most ancient data come from big bang nuclesynthesis ( bbn ) and give @xcite : @xmath10    \\(2 ) more recently we have the limit coming from the power spectrum of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite : @xmath11    \\(3 ) from absorption spectra of distant quasars there are more controversial data .",
    "webb and murphy s groups combined data @xcite report a @xmath12 evidence for @xmath0 variation : @xmath13 on a cosmological time span between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this result has not been confirmed by other groups .",
    "for example , chand et al .  @xcite",
    "give : @xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "we have chosen to be conservative and will consider a limit based on the last two results , which is consistent with zero variation : @xmath20    \\(4 ) from the analysis of the ratio re / os in meteorites dating around 4.56 billion years ago it is possible to compute @xmath21re half - life , which gives @xcite : @xmath22    \\(5 ) from the oklo natural nuclear reactor that operated 2 billion years ago in gabon , we also have @xcite : @xmath23    \\(6 ) we then have limits coming from laboratory measurments which constrain the present rate of change of @xmath0 . comparing atomic clocks , which use different transitions and atoms , what is obtained is @xcite : @xmath24 where the dot represents differentiation w.r.t . cosmic time .",

    "we zoom on @xmath25 .",
    "the grey areas are those excluded by present data.,width=529 ]    \\(7 ) in addition to the limits discussed above , there is a constraint coming from indirect violation of the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) , parametrized by the etvs ratio @xmath26 where @xmath27 e @xmath28 are the accelerations of two different test bodies in the earth gravitational field .",
    "these constraints come from the fact that nucleon masses get electromagnetic corrections from quark - quark interactions .",
    "as extensively discussed in @xcite , the leading term of the electromagnetic contribution comes from the electrostatic energy of the quark distribution , which is proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the corrected masses , to leading order in @xmath6 , can then be written as @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 stand for proton and neutron and @xmath31 , @xmath32 . if we suppose that @xmath33 , then we will induce a @xmath1-dependence on the nucleon masses : @xmath34 if we define g_i = m_i = b_i [ gi ] we get an indirect violation of the equivalence principle induced by the ` fifth - force ' mediated by the scalar field @xmath35 where : @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "the suffix @xmath38 refers to the earth , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer to two test bodies having equal mass but different composition . from eqs .",
    "( [ gi])-([eta ] ) we see that any model of @xmath0-variation will induce a characteristic @xmath41 and hence wep violation : while the first two factors in eq .  ( [ eta ] ) are universal and depend on the earth composition , the third term is not zero if and only if @xmath42 and the test bodies have different composition in neutrons and protons .",
    "the current limits on wep violations impose @xcite :    @xmath43",
    "following olive et al .",
    "@xcite , the most generic action involving a scalar field , the standard model fields and an hypothetical dark matter particle @xmath44 , can be written as [ action ] s & = & d^4x  r + d^4x + & - & 1 4 d^4x  b_f()f_f^ - 1 4 d^4x   b_f_i()f^(i)_f^(i ) + & + & d^4x   _ j + & + & d^4x   where @xmath45 and for the electromagnetic term , for example , @xmath46 .",
    "the index @xmath47 refers to the @xmath48 gauge group of the standard model and @xmath49 runs over the various matter fields .",
    "the form of the action ( [ action ] ) follows from supplying @xmath1-dependent factors to all mass and kinetic terms to the standard lagrangian ( which would have all @xmath50 ) .",
    "in general we would expect that all of the @xmath51 s are switched on , if not forbidden by any symmetry principle .",
    "however , the theoretical treatment of the full lagrangian is very cumbersome and so the coupling functions @xmath51 are usually switched on one at a time . in this way one can also disentangle the effects due to each single term . in this paper",
    "we want to focus on the fine - structure constant @xmath0 , and so we will keep only @xmath52 and set all the other functions equal to 1 .    the relevant part of the action for the effect we are going to study is then [ action2 ] s = d^4x  r + d^4x + - 1 4 d^4x  b_f()f_f^ which allows to define an `` effective '' fine structure constant @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the value measured today . from ( [ alpha ] )",
    "we obtain the relative variation relevant for each cosmological epoch @xmath55 it can immediately be seen that , depending on the cosmological evolution of @xmath56 and on the functional form of @xmath3 , the fine structure constant @xmath0 could in principle have had many possible histories during the life - time of the universe .",
    "what possibilities are allowed by a general coupling @xmath5 within the avaliable observational constraints is then worth studying .",
    "the relevant equations governing the cosmological evolution in a flat universe are the following = -  _ i ( 1 + 3 w_i)_i [ ddota ] + h^2 ( ) ^2 =   _ i [ h2 ] + + 3h + = 0 [ phi - eq ] where @xmath57 runs over the matter ( including dark matter ) , radiation and scalar components",
    ". the relevant equations of state are @xmath58 for matter , @xmath59 for radiation and @xmath60 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ wphi ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the evolution equation of the quintessence scalar ( [ phi - eq ] ) does not depend on @xmath61 or its derivatives .",
    "this is due to the fact that the statistical average of the term @xmath62 over a current state of the universe is zero .",
    "so the only term that drives @xmath1 during the cosmological evolution is the potential @xmath63 .",
    "since we are working under the hypothesis that the scalar field @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ phi - eq ] ) is the quintessence scalar , we should also impose the additional constraints coming from quintessence phenomenology .",
    "in particular we choose a runaway potential which goes to zero as far as the field @xmath1 rolls to infinity , in accordance with the observational data .",
    "it is also required that the scalar dynamics gives the correct value for the equation of state @xmath64 the most general form for the quintessence potential involves a combination of a power - law and exponential terms @xcite . for the purpose of this paper , however , we will consider the simplest case of an inverse power - law potential @xmath65 , which gives a late - time attractor equation of state @xmath66 during matter domination @xcite .",
    "the potential should also be normalized in order to give the correct energy density today ( @xmath67 ) : this sets the mass scale @xmath68 .",
    "in what follows we will choose @xmath69 in the potential in order to have the correct attractor equation of state , and so obtain @xmath70{2/3~\\rho_c^0 ~m_p}$ ] .",
    "we have checked that choosing different quintessence potentials gives a subdominant effect on the cosmological variation of @xmath0 , with respect to changing the coupling function @xmath5 . in what follows we",
    "will then fix @xmath71 and study the effect of different @xmath5 s",
    ". an interesting study , which is complementary to what is done here , is that of ref .",
    "@xcite where the effect induced by different quintessence models on the cosmological @xmath72 is examined in detail , while keeping the function @xmath5 fixed .    in order to be as general as possible",
    "we will consider a function @xmath5 which is a combination of different possible behaviors and characterized by a set of four parameters that are allowed to vary freely : [ bf ] b_f ( ) = ( ) ^  e^(-_0 ) .",

    ", the behavior at small red - shift can be qualitatively very different depending on the model we choose : sharply decreasing in the polynomial coupling case or mildly decreasing with the power  law coupling .    by combining different functional forms , a notable feature emerged . in some cases it is possible that the scalar dynamics drives @xmath72 to a zero at some time in the past , thus inverting the slope of its cosmological evolution .",

    "it is also worth remarking that in our parameter space span we found solutions with extremely reduced fine - tuning and still compatible with the available constraints .",
