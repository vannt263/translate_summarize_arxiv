    "electrically and optically detected magnetic resonance experiments ( edmr and odmr , respectively ) are alternative ways to detect electron spin resonances ( esr ) in materials with charge carrier transport or recombination transitions that are governed by spin  selection rules  @xcite . the advantage of edmr and odmr in comparison to the traditional esr spectroscopy is the sensitivity of these methods which is typically 6 to 10 orders of magnitude higher  @xcite .",
    "this has become particularly useful for the investigation of paramagnetic centers in highly diluted matrices or low dimensional semiconductor thin film devices and interfaces , point defects  @xcite and defect clusters .",
    "one of the challenges of edmr and odmr spectroscopy is that the information obtained from these experiments is different in comparison to the esr data  @xcite .",
    "the reasons for the discrepancies between esr and edmr / odmr are mainly due to the two different measurement approaches which imply two different observables : when the density operator @xmath1 represents the spin ensemble to be investigated , the observable corresponding to esr experiments will always be spin polarization @xmath2 represented by the spin polarization operator @xmath3 whereas for the indirect detection through spin ",
    "dependent transport or recombination , the observables are the permutation  symmetry or -antisymmetry operators represented by the singlet @xmath4 or triplet operators @xmath5 , respectively  @xcite . for many experimental edmr / odmr studies ( the so called continuous wave experiments )",
    "the different description of the observables is not relevant , since these experiments are carried out in the incoherent time regime where only a line shape analysis of the respective spectra is feasible .",
    "however , when coherent effects are studied with pulsed techniques ( pedmr / podmr )  @xcite the interpretation of the experiments strongly relies on the proper theoretical description of spin interaction during coherent microwave excitation  @xcite .",
    "an example for the difference between a pedmr signal and an esr signal which come from the same spin ensemble are weakly exchange and weakly dipolar coupled distant pair states in the band gap of an arbitrary semiconductor material with weak spin  orbit coupling as described analytically by boehme and lips  @xcite",
    ". weak spin ",
    "spin coupling means the coupling is much weaker than the difference @xmath6 of the larmor ",
    "frequencies @xmath7 of the pair partners @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath10 represents bohr s magneton and @xmath11 the magnitude of an external magnetic field to which the spin pair is exposed .",
    "examples for such systems could be donor ",
    "acceptor pairs whose distance is sufficiently large , yet not large enough to make donor  acceptor recombination impossible  @xcite , or equivalently , trap  dangling bond recombination in disordered silicon materials such as amorphous or microcrystalline silicon  @xcite .",
    "weak spin ",
    "orbit coupling is required in order to ensure spin  conservation and therefore , a spin  selection rule .",
    "it is fulfilled for instance in all known silicon morphologies but also in many organic semiconductor materials  @xcite .",
    "when the two pair constituents are manipulated identically with a coherent pulse of high field strength   @xmath12 ( @xmath13  , whereas @xmath14 is the gyromagnetic ratio ) , they undergo a simultaneous spin  rabi oscillation .",
    "this can be detected by means of pulse length dependence measurements with both , pesr and pedmr .",
    "with pesr , the measurement could be conducted by integration of the free induction decay and would be called a transient nutation experiment  @xcite whereas with pedmr , the rate relaxation after the coherent excitation would be integrated reflecting the pair permutation symmetry within the pairs at the end of the exciting pulse  @xcite . while both , the pesr and the pedmr transients would exhibit oscillating signals , the frequency of these oscillations would differ by a factor of 2 : the pesr detected nutation frequency @xmath15 would simply represent the rabi frequency of an uncoupled spin @xmath16 , whereas the pedmr measured oscillation would exhibit the frequency at which the identically precessing spins of the two pair partners cross the geometric plane transverse to the field direction of the externally applied magnetic field @xmath11 ( the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane ) since at these moments , the projection of the parallel oriented spins in the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane onto the spin eigenstates with singlet content will be maximized . since this plane",
    "is passed twice per nutation period , the oscillation of the transition rate is twice as high .",
    "note that this frequency discrepancy of the oscillations between pesr and pedmr detected transient nutations is changed as the @xmath12field strength becomes weak : when @xmath19 , an esr excitation will be possible with only one pair partner at the same time .",
    "thus , the maximum singlet content of a pair will be achieved when the spin orientations therein point into opposite directions parallel to the @xmath11 field .",
    "hence , for weak @xmath12 fields , the nutation frequencies for pesr and pedmr become equal .    in the following",
    ", a semi  analytical study is presented which describes spin  dependent electronic transition rates ( e.g. recombination or hopping transport ) when the driving forces for rabi oscillation ( under experimental conditions these are typically strong coherent microwave fields ) are between a weak ( @xmath19 ) and a strong excitation regime ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "goal of this study is to fill the gap between the two analytically derived extremal cases of very weak and very strong excitation as presented by boehme and lips  @xcite and to describe a general behavior of the nutation frequency reflected by the spin ",
    "dependent transition rates for arbitrary @xmath12 and @xmath21 and arbitrary excitation frequencies @xmath22 . for a straight forward interpretation of experimental results  @xcite",
    ", it is of particular interest to understand if the change of rabi frequency from @xmath23 to @xmath24 takes place continuously or abruptly .     as a function of the pulse length @xmath25 and the applied microwave frequency @xmath26 for a spin pair with large larmor separation @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters of the simulation were @xmath28ghz , @xmath29ghz for @xmath30 and microwave excitation frequencies of @xmath31 as well as a @xmath12-field of @xmath32mhz .",
    "one can distinguish the two resonant peaks and recognize the nutation on the pulse length axis.,width=317 ]",
    "the basis for the results presented in the following are the pair models for spin  dependent recombination and transport as described and discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these models are based on the kaplan ",
    "solomon  mott model  @xcite under consideration of non - negligible triplet transition probabilities and spin relaxation . for the calculation of the data presented we strictly follow these models under the assumption of negligible spin  spin interactions .",
    "note that this constraint does not apply to all known experimental systems and will always have to be considered when the results presented in the following are applied to the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "quantitatively , the models outlined can be represented by an ensemble of spin @xmath16 pairs described by the density operator @xmath1 as derived in ref .",
    "we define @xmath33 to be the hamiltonian of an individual pair with @xmath34 representing the unperturbed hamiltonian in the presence of a constant magnetic field @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the perturbation with a circularly polarized microwave of angular frequency @xmath22 and strength @xmath12 .",
    "note the absence of spin  spin coupling in @xmath37 in contrast to eq .",

    "the dynamics of the ensemble of spin pairs can be described by a liouville equation @xmath38 ^ -$ ] in which , in contrast to eq . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , all stochastic terms have been dropped since incoherent processes are considered to be negligible during the applied coherent esr pulse . only coherent pulses  these are pulses that are shorter than the fastest incoherent processes  are considered in the following .",
    "the ensemble of spins as represented by the density operator @xmath39 can be expressed by a unitary , time ",
    "dependent 4@xmath404 matrix . due to the absence of coupling",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath37 will be diagonal in the product base with four eigenvalues @xmath41 and @xmath42 wherein @xmath43 and @xmath21 represent the sum and the difference of the larmor frequencies @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "when a solution for @xmath46 is found , the transients of the spin ",
    "dependent transition rate @xmath47\\ ] ] can be calculated from the projection of the permutation symmetry operators on the ensemble state .",
    "experimentally , a real  time observation of @xmath48 on typical time scales in the lower ns - range is difficult to obtain with podmr and often impossible with pedmr due to the insufficient time resolution caused by the long dielectric relaxation times of semiconductors in particular at low temperatures .",
    "hence , transient nutation experiments are typically conducted by means of decay transient measurements as a function of the applied pulse length  @xcite .",
    "dynamics during the coherent spin excitations are obtained from these pulse length dependence measurements by charge integration @xmath49 which reveals the permutation symmetry state at the end of the microwave pulse as explained in detail in ref .  @xcite . under the given conditions , @xmath50 } = \\frac{\\rho_{44}(\\tau)-\\rho^s_{44}}{\\mathrm{tr}[\\rho^s]}\\ ] ] whereas @xmath51 is the steady state value of the matrix element @xmath52 of the density matrix @xmath1 .",
    "hence , it is @xmath53 which is the observable calculated and displayed in the following . note",
    "that while @xmath49 represents a number of charge carriers for pedmr experiments , the integration of the photoluminescence decay transient in podmr reveals a number of photons .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases , the observable shall be referred to as @xmath49 in the following and is always plotted in arbitrary units because of this ambiguity .",
    "when incoherence is negligible , the hamiltonian @xmath54 can be diagonalized for any given parameter set and thus , the liouville equation in its time integrated form @xmath55 can be solved by a simple matrix multiplication in which @xmath56 $ ] is the same initial state as used in ref .",
    "the solution @xmath57 is referred to as `` semi  analytic '' since this is easy to perform by means of calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath58 with any given parameter set while attempting to solve it fully analytically for arbitrary variables leads to unreasonably lengthy expressions .",
    "figure  [ fi2 ] displays an example for the time domain result for @xmath49 as a function of the larmor frequency for a spin pair ensemble with a larmor separation much larger than @xmath59 which is one of the extremal cases discussed in ref .",

    "pair partners as well as the undamped rabi ",
    "nutation on the scale of the pulse length @xmath25 . outside of the resonances , the signal intensity drops while the nutation frequency increases .",
    "the latter is well known and understood from the expression of the rabi frequency as introduced in eq .",
    "28 of ref .",
    "it is due to the spin nutation about the residual @xmath11-field @xmath63 in the rotating frame which increases with the distance of the excitation frequency from the resonance frequency .",
    "figure  [ fi2 ] shows that the relevant information contained in the calculated transients @xmath49 are the frequencies as well as the amplitudes of the nutation components .",
    "thus , from the solutions of @xmath49 the absolute fourier transform ( ft ) was calculated in order to analyze the various nutation frequencies contained therein .",
    "in contrast to the short 1@xmath64s transient shown in fig .",
    "[ fi2 ] , the time scale for the time domain simulation and , therefore , the fourier integration was chosen to be 5@xmath64s long . for the parameters used throughout this study",
    "this corresponds to at least 50 rabi oscillation periods .",

    "analytical calculations for spin pairs with four different larmor separations ( @xmath67 = 1mhz , 5mhz , 20mhz , 40mhz ) for microwave excitation frequencies of @xmath68 with a given @xmath12-field of @xmath32mhz .",
    "while the plots ( a.i ) and ( a.iv ) fulfill the extremal cases of small and large larmor separation , respectively , the plots ( a.ii ) and ( a.iii ) describe two intermediate cases with @xmath69 .",
    "note that the scaling of the color code was normalized to the maximum for each graph in order to achieve sufficient contrast . in order to be able to compare the four different cases more easily , the rabi components ft@xmath66 at the resonance frequency of the two spin partners",
    "are plotted in the respective graphs ( red curves ) as conventional two - dimensional plots . here , the chosen scaling is equal for all graphs .",
    "the four cases displayed in fig .",
    "[ fi3](a ) confirm the hyperbolic increase of the rabi frequency @xmath70 as the microwave frequency is shifted out of resonance .",
    "one can deduce from the two  dimensional inset plots of fig .",
    "[ fi3](a.i ) and ( a.iv ) , that the on  resonance cases show only one frequency component for the two extremal cases , namely @xmath71 for large larmor separation and @xmath72 for small larmor separation .",
    "this confirms the analytical results of ref .",
    "@xcite . outside of the resonances ( @xmath73 )",
    ", the oscillation splits into two components for the extremal cases and in the general , intermediate cases , there are up to four different nutation frequencies .    in order to illustrate the transition from a single @xmath74 to a single @xmath72 frequency component with decreasing larmor separation ( or equivalently spoken , for an increasing microwave field @xmath12 ) , a plot of @xmath65 = ft@xmath66 versus the ratio @xmath75 on a logarithmic scale around @xmath76 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fi4 ] for the one spin on resonant cases @xmath77 ( a ) and the average frequency case @xmath78 ( b ) .",
    "again , for the extremal cases of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the plots confirm the known results for small and large larmor separation described above . in fig .",
    "[ fi4](a ) , one can see for @xmath79 ( @xmath81 < 0 $ ] ) that there is only one component with @xmath72 . as @xmath75 increases and approaches 1 ( @xmath82 $ ] approaches 0 )",
    ", this component gradually becomes weaker and its frequency increases .",
    "this behavior can be understood by the fact that in fig .",
    "[ fi4](a ) , @xmath22 is always equal to one of the pair partner resonances .",
    "when @xmath21 becomes larger , @xmath83 and thus , an increase of the observed nutation frequency takes place .",
    "when @xmath84 ( @xmath85\\approx 0 $ ] ) , two new nutation components become visible : ( i ) a low frequency component which generally is hard to separate from any given offset in the function @xmath49 and ( ii ) one component with @xmath71 .",
    "the magnitude of the latter rises from very small values for @xmath79 and increases asymptotically to a maximum value for @xmath86 whereas the two other components vanish . a complementary view on these changes is given by fig .",
    "[ fi4](b ) where the rabi  components for an excitation frequency @xmath87 are plotted versus @xmath88 . for @xmath79 , plot ( a ) and ( b ) agree since they represent the same physical situation .",
    "when @xmath75 increases and @xmath89 , no low frequency component becomes visible .",
    "the @xmath71 component , which also becomes visible will increase proportionally to @xmath21 since it is off - resonant to the applied microwave frequency @xmath22 .",
    "as function of @xmath90 for an excitation frequency ( a ) @xmath77 on resonance with one of the pair partners and ( b ) @xmath87 on resonance with the average @xmath91 of the pair partners larmor frequencies.,width=317 ]",
    "the simulation of spin  rabi oscillation as observed by pedmr / podmr reveals that the doubling of the nutation frequency @xmath71 to @xmath72 with decreasing larmor separation ( @xmath75 ) is abrupt which means that there is no continuous increase of the oscillation frequency . instead , only the magnitudes of the various components change in the intermediate larmor separation regime about @xmath92 . here , four nutation components become visible which can all become significant at the same time .",
    "mathematically , it is obvious that the pairs consisting of two @xmath16 particles with four eigenstates will reveal four eigenfrequencies for any given general set of parameters .",
    "we interpret this behavior for the general case as the interplay of the two one  spin systems and the one two ",
    "spin system by which the spin pairs are described in the two extremal cases discussed above .",
    "the results of the analytical derivation given in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the most significant qualitative change that takes place when the larmor separation changes from infinity to zero , is that a transition from a one  spin to a two  spin system occurs .",
    "for the one  spin system , the spin in resonance ( note that here , only one spin can be in resonance ) fully determines the oscillation of the pairs permutation symmetry whereas for the two  spin system , the permutation symmetry is determined by the relative movements and spin orientations within the pair ensemble . for large larmor separation , at least one spin will remain fixed in its initial state , typically an eigenstate with polarization parallel to the @xmath11-axis . as the excitation frequency",
    "is changed , the system becomes off - resonant , and two one  spin contributions @xmath93 appear where the frequency of one increases whereas the frequency of the other decreases at the same time .",
    "the pair still behaves like two individual one  spin systems . for small larmor separation ,",
    "there are always two spins in motion as long as the system is on resonance ( there is then only one resonance line observed ) .",
    "hence , since the relative spin motion of the two spins within the pair will now determine the oscillation of the electronic rate transition , the beat frequencies @xmath94 of the two one  spin nutation frequencies can be expected . here , @xmath95 and @xmath96 stand for parallel and antiparallel orientations , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fi3](b ) displays four plots of the nutation frequencies obtained with the simple terms given in eqs .",
    "[ onespin ] and [ twospin ] for the same parameter sets used for the simulation results displayed in fig .  [ fi3](a ) .",
    "while this purely phenomenological description of the nutation frequencies can not account for the intensities of the nutation components  this is the reason why there is no grey scale gradient in fig .",
    "[ fi3](b )  it nevertheless shows , that there is an excellent agreement of eqs .  [ onespin ] and [ twospin ] with the semi  analytically calculated frequency patterns displayed in fig .  [",
    "fi3](b ) .",
    "while simple quantitative predictions can be made for the nutation frequencies , there are no straight forward formulas for the prediction of the nutation amplitudes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi3](a ) , the intensities of the different nutation components can have quite complex microwave frequency ( @xmath22 ) dependencies .",
    "well separated lines ( case of large larmor separation ) exhibit lorentzian line shapes determined by the @xmath12 field due to the power broadening as described in ref .  @xcite . for intermediate cases ,",
    "the @xmath22dependence becomes much more complex and a given nutation component can exhibit a maximum at its corresponding resonance but also a local minimum at the resonance of a non corresponding transition .",
    "an example for this behavior is the data of fig .",
    "[ fi3](a.iii ) . at a frequency of @xmath97",
    "one can recognize both , a maximum of the nutation component at @xmath71 but also a minimum of the respective other nutation component at @xmath98 .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior can be interpreted by consideration of a four  level system .",
    "any of the four levels can undergo first order transitions into two different states . for excitations which are out of resonance with both transitions ,",
    "the transition probability is small but may not be negligible in the vicinity of the resonances .",
    "however , when one transition is induced resonantly , the transition into the non  resonantly excited state is quenched at the same time and the intensity of its corresponding nutation component is quenched .",
    "note that in spite of this qualitative interpretation , quantitative predictions have to be made by means of the simulation methods described above .",
    "in summary , the response of charge carrier transport and recombination rates through localized electronic states in semiconductors to a coherent manipulation by magnetic resonance were simulated as they would be expected in pedmr / podmr experiments .",
    "the transient response was calculated with the spin excitation present for different excitation fields and frequencies as well as different larmor separations within the pairs .",
    "it was assumed that exchange and dipolar interaction are weak and incoherence due to the electronic transitions or spin - relaxation is negligible .",
    "the presented data were obtained by a semi - analytical simulation method .",
    "the results show that four qualitatively distinguishable nutation processes influence the oscillation of the transition rates which reduce to one significant contribution in the cases of large and small larmor separations .",
    "simple empirical equations for the calculation of these nutation frequencies have been obtained which match the simulated data excellently and a qualitative picture for the interpretation of the nutation intensities has been discussed .",
    "the presence of the four nutation processes implies that changing the larmor separation or the applied excitation field leads to an abrupt and not continuous change of the observed nutation frequencies .",
