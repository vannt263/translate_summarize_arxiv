    "the influence of boundaries on the vacuum state of a quantum field leads to interesting physical consequences .",
    "well known example is the casimir effect ( see @xcite and references therein ) , when the modification of the zero - point fluctuations spectrum by the presence of boundaries induces vacuum forces acting on these boundaries .",
    "another interesting effect is the creation of particles from the vacuum by moving boundaries @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study the scalar vacuum polarization brought about by the presence of infinite plane boundary moving by uniform acceleration through the fulling - rindler vacuum .",
    "this problem for the conformally coupled dirichlet and neumann massless scalar and electromagnetic fields in four dimensional spacetime was considered by candelas and deutsch @xcite . here",
    "we will investigate the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor for the massive scalar field with general curvature coupling and satisfying robin boundary condition on the infinite plane in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "the dimensional dependence of physical quantities is of considerable interest in the casimir effect and is investigated for various geometries of boundaries and boundary conditions ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the robin boundary conditions are an extension of the ones imposed on perfectly conducting boundaries and may , in some geometries , be useful for depicting the finite penetration of the field into the boundary with the `` skin - depth '' parameter related to the robin coefficient @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quantum scalar field satisfying robin condition on the boundary of a cavity violates the bekenstein s entropy - to - energy bound near certain points in the space of the parameter defining the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "this type of conditions also appear in considerations of the vacuum effects for a confined charged scalar field in external fields @xcite and in quantum gravity @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "mixed boundary conditions naturally arise for scalar and fermion bulk fields in the randall - sundrum model @xcite . in this model",
    "the bulk geometry is a slice of anti - de sitter space and the corresponding robin coefficient is related to the curvature scale of this space . unlike to ref.@xcite , where the region of the right rindler wedge on the right from the barrier ( in the following we will denote this region as rr ) is considered only , we investigate vacuum energy density and stresses in both regions , including the one between the barrier and rindler horizon ( region rl in the following consideration ) . our calculation is based on the summation formula derived in appendix [ sec : app1 ] on the base of the generalized abel - plana formula @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this allows to extract explicitly the part due to the unbounded rindler spacetime and to present the boundary part in terms of strongly convergent integrals .",
