    "the analysis of the first 22 months of _ kepler _ data shows over 2700 planetary candidates detected through transit observations @xcite , most of which orbit within 0.5 au of their star .",
    "many of these planets have radii of 26 r@xmath2 , which is roughly the neptune size range , but most seem to be sub - neptune in terms of mass . a small fraction of the _ kepler _ planets also have mass determinations . for example , transit timing variations in the kepler-11 system yield masses between 1.9 and 8.0 m@xmath2 for radii between 1.8 and 4.2 r@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a radial velocity survey @xcite provides additional masses .",
    "@xcite analyzed about 30 planets , combining their statistical data from transit timing variations with radial velocity data from other sources to estimate a mass - radius relation in the mass range 225 m@xmath2 .",
    "they find @xmath3 m@xmath4r@xmath5 with considerable scatter , in constrast to the more standard relation often used to derive masses from transit radii : @xmath6m@xmath7r@xmath8 , based on planets in the solar system of saturn mass or less @xcite .",
    "again , many of the wu & lithwick objects fall into the  sub - neptune \" class .",
    "@xcite find a mass - radius fit for planets with radii between 1.5 and 4 r@xmath2 , using data largely independent of those of @xcite : @xmath6m@xmath9r@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite include the stellar flux at the planet ( @xmath11 ) in the mass - radius relation and find a somewhat different relation , for planet masses less than 150 m@xmath2 : @xmath12 , where @xmath11 is in units of erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 and radii and masses are in earth units .",
    "a list of all explanets with measured masses and radii ( as of early 2013 ) is found in @xcite ; a list of such planets with radii less than 4 r@xmath2 ( as of early 2014 ) is in @xcite , and one for planets of less than 100 m@xmath2 ( as of late 2013 ) appears in @xcite .",
    "given the density , from the mass and radius measurements , planets with masses in the range 110 m@xmath2 can be separated into three groups .",
    "the higher - density group , with mean density @xmath15 g @xmath16 , must have a  rocky \" composition almost entirely of heavy elements .",
    "the low - density planets ( @xmath17 g @xmath16 ) also have a substantial fraction of their mass in a heavy - element core of rock and ( possibly ) ice , but must also have a significant fraction of their volumes occupied by light gasses .",
    "intermediate - density planets can either have their volumes containing substantial amounts of rock and of h / he , or can be composed mostly of water and/or other astrophysical ices .",
    "this paper focusses on the low - density group .",
    "model calculations of the thermal evolution of sub - neptune type planets , up to ages of 5 gyr @xcite show , however , very little dependence of radius on mass for a given h / he mass fraction and given incident stellar flux .",
    "the radius decreases slowly with age after 1 gyr , and the radius at 5 gyr is practically independent of mass in the range 120 m@xmath2 .",
    "the radius at that time is very weakly dependent on stellar flux , but increases markedly with h / he mass fraction .",
    "these authors therefore interpret the observed trend of increased radius with mass as primarily a composition effect , that is , on the average the higher mass planets have higher h / he mass fraction and therefore larger radii .",
    "this paper investigates the origin and evolution of such objects .",
    "the main issue is whether they formed _ in situ _ or whether they formed at much larger distances , say 46 au , and then , or during the formation process , migrated inward to their present orbital positions . regarding the kepler-11 planets , @xcite question whether migration was involved because it would be expected to result in mean - motion resonances in multiplanet systems , which are not observed in this particular system",
    "however , later studies of dynamical and dissipative effects @xcite show that in fact such planets can migrate though resonances , thereby alleviating the constraint .",
    "also , thermal evolution calculations for such planets @xcite , coupled with mass loss , indicate that _ in situ _ formation is not likely and that the planets probably formed beyond the snow line , with a substantial water component .",
    "this conclusion is based on models of @xcite of the accretion of gas onto already - formed rocky cores in the inner disk .",
    "the mass loss calculations imply an inconsistency for the kepler-11 planets if they formed _ in situ _ : the original mass of their h / he envelopes would have been larger than the amount they could have accreted according to @xcite .",
    "theoretical work by @xcite on the formation of sub - neptunes and super - earths assumes that they form _ in situ _ but that much of the required solid material arrives by migration of rock - sized objects from larger distance .",
    "this process was originally investigated , in the context of hot jupiters , by @xcite and applied to the case of 51 peg b by @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that gas accretion onto rocky cores is likely to occur if the accumulated disk mass in solids inside 1 au is greater than about 25 m@xmath2 , which is about 8 times that in the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) .",
    "@xcite consider the formation of super - earths _ in situ _ with no migration , based on a disk model that is somewhat enhanced in solid material with respect to the minimum - mass solar nebula ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "their rough estimates indicate that rocky planets in close orbits can capture and retain gaseous envelopes of a few percent to tens of percent of the planet s mass .",
    "@xcite do _ in situ _ calculations , from the full stellar structure equations , of the accretion of gas onto rocky cores in the inner disk during the dissipation phase of the gas disk .",
    "parameters include the core mass @xmath18 , the disk temperature @xmath19 , and the characteristic disk dissipation time @xmath20 .",
    "core masses range from 1 to 10 m@xmath2 .",
    "calculations end when the disk has completely dissipated .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 m@xmath2 , @xmath22 k , and @xmath23 yr , the accumulated gas envelope mass is about @xmath24 m@xmath2 if core cooling is not considered , and is about @xmath25 m@xmath2 in the more realistic case when the cooling is included .",
    "the range of ratios of envelope mass to core mass is from 0.0002 to 0.1 .",
    "reasonably good agreement between these envelope masses and those deduced for the kepler-11 planets @xcite can be obtained for @xmath26 myr , but not for significantly shorter times .",
    "in contrast , @xcite calculate detailed core - accretion models for sub - neptune objects forming at 4 au and 5.2 au , assuming that they later migrate to positions where the equilibrium temperature is 500 to 1000 k. after accretion ends , the planets , which have @xmath18 in the range 2.54 m@xmath2 , are evolved up to ages of 4 gyr .",
    "the full evolutionary calculations are supplemented with static core / envelope models that cover a wide range ( 1 to 20 m@xmath2 ) of planet masses @xmath27 and ratios @xmath28 .",
    "theoretical radii at late times from these calculations agree , generally for @xmath29 , with those observed by _",
    "kepler_. the present work extends these formation calculations to a range of distances from 0.5 au to 4 au and considers in further detail the question regarding how much gas can be accreted by heavy - element cores in the 2.22.5 m@xmath2 range , in the warm inner regions of the disk .",
    "the implications regarding formation _ in situ _ or formation accompanied by migration are then discussed .",
    "the calculations for these low - mass planets , with final core masses of 2.22.5 m@xmath2 , include two phases .",
    "the formation phase , starting with @xmath30 1 m@xmath2 , involves accretion of heavy - element  core \" mass as well as gaseous envelope mass .",
    "the following evolutionary phase , starting at the end of accretion , involves contraction and cooling of the gaseous envelope , at constant mass and with the planet isolated from the disk , up to a final age of several gyr . the computational method and physical assumptions",
    "are described in detail in previous publications @xcite and references therein . during the early part of the formation phase",
    ", the gaseous envelope has low mass , and the core fairly rapidly accretes to close to its final mass .",
    "the later parts of the formation phase are characterized by slow envelope accretion at practically constant @xmath18 .",
    "the core accretion rate is given by the standard equation @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the effective geometrical capture radius for planetesimals , @xmath33 is the mass per unit area of solid material ( planetesimals ) in the disk , @xmath34 is the planet s orbital frequency , and @xmath35 is the gravitational enhancement factor to the geometrical capture cross - section .",
    "the planetesimal radius is taken to be 100 km , and @xmath35 is taken from @xcite .",
    "in fact , if a reasonable distribution of planetesimal sizes were taken into account , the formation time would be reduced . however , the large size partially compensates for the effect that the formation times based on @xcite are somewhat faster than those found in more detailed simulations , e. g. , @xcite . in any case , the core grows rapidly in the inner region of a protoplanetary disk , and the precise value of the planetesimal size has little effect on the outcome .",
    "the surface density of planetesimals changes with time according to the prescription of @xcite , in which the accretion onto the protoplanet is taken into account , the feeding zone extends 4 hill radii on either side of the planetary orbit , and @xmath33 is assumed to be uniform with radius within the feeding zone .    in general @xmath36 , the radius of the heavy - element core , unless the envelope mass is negligible . in our trajectory calculations ,",
    "if the effects on a planetesimal of gas drag , ablation and fragmentation result in loss of over half of its mass before it hits the core or escapes , it is considered to have been captured by the envelope , and the amount of mass deposited in each layer is determined @xcite .",
    "the effective @xmath37 determined in this way ( see @xcite for details ) can be several times larger than @xmath38 .",
    "the dusty material deposited in the envelope enters into the opacity calculation ( see below ) ; it then is allowed to sink to the core .",
    "thus the change in envelope composition caused by the deposition of solid material is not taken into account , although @xcite show that an envelope enhanced in heavy elements can significantly increase the gas accretion rate at a given core mass and can reduce the critical core mass , that is , the mass required for rapid gas accretion to occur .",
    "however , @xcite show that the organic and rock components of the planetesimals in fact do not dissolve in the envelope and do sink , thus our assumption is valid for most of our simulations , those inside the snow line ( 2 au or less ) .",
    "icy material however does dissolve , so that in our calculations at 4 au the gas accretion rate may be affected , and the  core mass \" is somewhat overestimated .",
    "what we call @xmath18 there actually is the mass of heavy elements in the planet , after subtraction of the heavy - element component of the nebular material accreted at the surface of the envelope .",
    "the structure and evolution of the gaseous envelope is calculated according to the standard spherically symmetric equations of stellar structure @xcite , augmented by the effects of the time - dependent @xmath18 , the accretion rate of the envelope , and the interactions of the incoming planetesimals with the envelope .",
    "the temperature gradient is assumed to be the adiabatic gradient in convection zones .",
    "the main energy sources are planetesimal accretion , and contraction and cooling of the gaseous envelope . in two cases ,",
    "test runs were carried out including heating effects resulting from radioactive decay in the core and from cooling of the 2.2 m@xmath2 core @xcite .",
    "the radioactive decay had practically no effect on the radius at 4 gyr .",
    "the core heating is calculated , assuming an isothermal core , according to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the luminosity delivered to the envelope by the cooling of the core , @xmath41 erg g@xmath13 k@xmath13 is the specific heat of the core , and @xmath42 is the temperature at the core / envelope interface . in agreement with @xcite , during the evolutionary ( cooling ) phase this luminosity can contribute 25% to 75% of the total internal luminosity , depending on the time , and it acts to lengthen the time to cool to a given radius .",
    "however , with or without this additional energy source , by the time the evolution reaches 4 gyr , the radius is changing very slowly , so the inclusion of @xmath43 makes practically no difference on the final value .",
    "the test runs including the core heating resulted in increases in the final radius of less than 5% . on the other hand , during the accretion phase , @xmath42 first increases with time as core and envelope increase in mass , so the envelope actually delivers energy to the core . later in the accretion phase",
    "@xmath42 decreases , and this energy is returned to the envelope . in any case , this luminosity is calculated to be only a few percent of the accretion luminosity and certainly has little effect on the radius or envelope mass at the end of accretion . therefore , the results quoted here for final radii do not include these effects , as they fall below the overall level of uncertainty in the simulations . the full set of equations is solved by the henyey method @xcite .",
    "the radius at the inner boundary of the envelope is set to @xmath38 , which is determined from its current mass .",
    "the core is composed either of iron and rock , with mass fractions 30% and 70% , respectively , or iron , rock , and ice , with mass fractions 10% , 23% , and 67% , respectively , depending on the formation location . given @xmath18 ,",
    "the radius is calculated from the equation of state of @xcite , as summarized by @xcite .",
    "the equation of state in the h / he envelope is taken to be that given by @xcite , which includes the partial degeneracy of the electrons as well as non - ideal effects in the gas . the chemical composition of the envelope is taken to be near - solar , with @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are , respectively , the mass fractions of h , he , and all remaining elements .",
    "the main feature of the rosseland mean opacity during the formation phase involves the use of dust grain opacities that take into account the settling and coagulation of the grains @xcite .",
    "dust grains enter the envelope through the ablation of planetesimals and are also carried in along with the accreting gas .",
    "the initial grain size is 0.1 @xmath47 m .",
    "grains are assumed to be spherical and to lack void spaces .",
    "the grain growth and settling are calculated in detail as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "grain growth up to 2.58 mm in size is considered .",
    "the grain size distributions and the rosseland mean opacities are recalculated in every layer at every time step .",
    "the grains are assumed to be composed of pure silicates , with a dust - to - gas ratio of 1:100 by mass within the gas that is accreted by the planet . at or interior to 2",
    "au , this approximation is reasonable ; even at 4 au the error introduced by this assumption is insignificant when one considers the uncertainties in grain shape , sticking probability in collisions , and radiative properties .",
    "the sticking probability is a parameter in the grain code , and it is set to unity in the present simulations .",
    "these opacities regulate the rate at which the envelope can contract , and therefore affect the gas accretion rate .    above 3000 k",
    ", the opacities of @xcite are used . between 3000 k and 1800 k ,",
    "the @xcite molecular opacities , which do not include dust grains , are used . below 1800 k",
    ", the dust opacities of @xcite are added to the molecular opacities .",
    "once the planet has reached its final mass , as determined by the lifetime of the disk , the grains settle rapidly , evaporate in the interior , and are no longer a significant opacity source . for the final isolation phase at constant mass , the molecular / atomic opacities of @xcite and @xcite are used , with solar composition .",
    "the gas accretion rate is determined by the condition that the planet outer radius @xmath48 , where the effective accretion radius is given by @xcite @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the sound speed in the disk , @xmath51 is the hill sphere radius , and @xmath27 is the total mass of the planet .",
    "the constant @xmath52 is determined by three - dimensional numerical simulations of disk flow in the vicinity of an embedded planet @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that the planet does not retain gas from the entire hill - sphere volume ; rather , it can occupy a region with radius @xmath53 .",
    "thus , if @xmath51 is small compared with the bondi accretion radius @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the surface boundary conditions depend on whether the planet is still accreting ( the formation phase ) or whether it is isolated ( the evolutionary phase ) . during the formation",
    "phase the temperature is set to a constant value appropriate for the protoplanetary disk , @xmath56 ( see table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "these temperatures correspond approximately to a ratio of sound speed to orbital speed of 0.05 , except at 0.5 au , where a slightly smaller ratio is taken .",
    "the density at the surface , @xmath57 , is determined initially from @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the gas surface density , the scale height @xmath60 , and @xmath61 at 4 au and 200 at 2 , 1 , and 0.5 au ( @xmath62 is the distance of the planet from the star ) . in three of the runs ,",
    "the disk lifetime is arbitrarily set to 2 myr .",
    "the density @xmath57 is assumed to decline linearly with time up to 1.9 myr ; then it is cut off more rapidly , to near zero , on the time scale of 10@xmath63 years .",
    "three other runs have the disk cutoff time set to match a pre - chosen envelope mass . here",
    "also the density drops rapidly during the 10@xmath63 years just before cutoff .",
    "envelope masses remain low in all calculated cases , so that the phase of rapid gas accretion associated with the growth of jupiter - mass planets never occurs .",
    "the isolation mass for the heavy - element planetary core , which in these simulations turns out to be close to the final core mass , is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mass of the central star , and @xmath66 , the number of hill - sphere radii defining the region , on each side of the planetary orbit , from which the object is able to capture planetesimals @xcite .",
    "once @xmath67 , the @xmath68 slows down drastically , but gas accretion continues . in these low - mass models the crossover mass ( when @xmath69 ) is never reached .",
    "note that the calculation method implicitly assumes that the core mass will reach @xmath70 ; formation of multiple embryos in the vicinity of @xmath62 is not considered .",
    "when the disk becomes very tenuous near the end of its lifetime , the planet makes a transition to isolated boundary conditions that take into account the radiation effect of the central star .",

    "the surface temperature is calculated from @xmath78 where @xmath79 is determined by the internal luminosity and the outer radius of the planet ( a generally small contribution ) , and @xmath80 , the equilibrium temperature of the planet in the radiation field of the star , is taken to be a parameter .",
    "the main parameters that are varied from run to run are the formation position of the planet in the disk , the value of the initial solid surface density @xmath33 at that position , and the time for cutoff of gas accretion .",
    "the planet s core mass is determined through the calculation itself ; in fact it is practically fixed by the choice of @xmath62 and @xmath33 , which determine @xmath70 ( equation [ eq : iso ] ) .",

    "the initial value of the core mass is about 1 m@xmath2 , and the starting time is arbitrarily set to @xmath81 yr , representing the approximate time to build this core at 5.2 au with @xmath82 g @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "closer to the star this time will be shorter , but in these calculations the total time to build the core is short compared with the overall evolutionary time . after formation , the planet is assumed to take on three different insolation temperatures : 250 k , 500 k , and 1000 k. in most cases this assumption implies a modest amount of migration .",

    "other differences are more subtle .    runs 4h and 2h have the same value of @xmath83 , but at a given @xmath80 the 4h planets are larger .",

    "second , they include heat loss from the rocky core in the envelope calculation , which we do not consider .",
    "as mentioned above , their final envelope mass depends on whether or not core heating is included , and it depends on the details of disk dissipation , while in our case , because envelope accretion occurs much earlier , the core luminosity has little effect .",
    "third , they do not include planetesimal accretion as an energy source in the envelope , an effect which we do include .",
    "fourth , differences in the details of the assumed disk dissipation procedure could account for some of the differences in the results for the envelope mass .",
    "fifth , except in one case they do not include dust grains in the calculation of the envelope opacity during the accretion phase .    mass loss may have played a modest role in the post - formation evolution of kepler-11 f. estimates in the literature of mass loss rates are based on energy - limited hydrodynamic escape driven by stellar euv and x - ray radiation @xcite .",
    "deduced histories of stellar euv and x - ray fluxes indicate that most of the mass loss occurs at ages @xmath130 gyr @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculate a loss of 0.1 m@xmath2 for kepler-11 f at its present orbit over its lifetime .",

    ", the planet should have lost its entire envelope according to their _ in situ _ calculation . in the case of our estimated envelope mass at 0.25 au , most or all of the envelope would have been lost .",
    "@xcite couple the mass loss calculation with post - formation thermal evolution for the kepler-11 planets at their current stellar input flux levels . for kepler-11 f , with an assumed rock / iron core and gaseous h / he envelope , and with the preliminary mass estimate of 2.3(+2.2 , 1.2 ) m@xmath2 , they conclude that the planet originally had roughly 30% of its mass in the h / he envelope , implying a mass loss of about 1 m@xmath2 .",

    ", we extend the run iia published by @xcite .",
    "this run places the forming planet at 4 au with a solid surface density of 6 g @xmath14 and a corresponding @xmath136 m@xmath2 ( these parameters are the same as in the current runs 4 and 4h ) .",
    "the physics included in the calculation is essentially the same as for the runs shown in table 1 .",
    "the run iia was cut off at 2 myr with @xmath137 m@xmath2 and @xmath138 m@xmath2 .",
    "the continuation to 3 myr shows that @xmath98 remains at a fairly constant value of @xmath139 m@xmath2 yr@xmath13 . at 3 myr",
    "the core and envelope masses are , respectively 2.8 and 0.91 m@xmath2 .",
    "further evolution for another myr would result in an estimated @xmath140 m@xmath2 .",
    "thus it is reasonable to be able to form a planet with the pre - mass - loss characteristics of kepler-11 f within a standard disk lifetime .",
    "the relatively small core mass results in a slow envelope accretion rate , so the object is unlikely to reach the stage of rapid gas accretion . although @xcite did not calculate the formation phase , this result is consistent with their suggestion that formation of the kepler-11 system occurred outside the snow line and that the cores contain a substantial ice component .",
    "a rather different result on mass loss is obtained by @xcite .",
    "using essentially the same energy - limited mass loss formula as in the previously - cited papers , but without a full calculation of the thermal evolution , they find that the amount of mass lost over the lifetime is given by ( their equation 31 ) @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the radius during the time before 0.1 myr and @xmath143 is the total planet mass .",
    "taking @xmath144 m@xmath2 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 au , and estimating @xmath147 r@xmath2 from figure [ fig:2 ] with @xmath148 m@xmath2 , we obtain @xmath149 m@xmath2 .",
    "note that all of these mass loss estimates involve considerable uncertainty .    in summary",
    ", the mass loss estimates from @xcite and @xcite imply that kepler-11 f initially had @xmath150 m@xmath2 and could easily have formed within 2 au as an object with a rock / iron core and a low - mass h / he envelope ; note that our calculation at 2 au gives an envelope mass just after formation of 0.16 m@xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , with the mass loss estimate from @xcite , or in any case with mass loss substantially greater than 0.1 m@xmath2 , the object is much more likely to have formed exterior to the snow line with an ice - rich core . in both cases ,",
    "migration to the present orbital location is indicated .",
    "_ in situ _ formation is possible only under a very limited set of assumptions , including ( 1 ) the planet s mass is near the one - standard - deviation observational upper limit ( 2.8 m@xmath2 ) , ( 2 ) mass loss after formation is negligible , and ( 3 ) either a ) the solid surface density in the disk at the formation location is about 1700 g @xmath14 , which is required to build a 2.8 m@xmath2 core at 0.25 au ( eq . [ eq : iso ] ) , or b ) an equivalent mass in solids was delivered to the planet via gas drag .",
    "we investigate the formation and evolution , up to 4 gyr , of planets with core masses of 2.22.5 m@xmath2 and with core compositions of either iron and rock or iron and rock and ice .",
    "gas accretion onto the cores is calculated with a detailed envelope model that includes the effects of dust settling and coagulation in the opacity calculation .",
    "the accretion is carried out at distances of 4 , 2 , 1 , and 0.5 au from the central star . at a fixed cutoff time for the protoplanetary disk ( 2 myr ) ,",
    "the amount of accreted gas ranges from 0.037 m@xmath2 at 0.5 au to 0.16 m@xmath2 at 2 au .",
    "previous results @xcite at 4 au give an envelope mass of 0.54 m@xmath2 at the same time with a slightly higher core mass . for @xmath83 in the range 0.037 to 0.16 m@xmath2 , final radii , after 4 gyr , fall in the range 26 r@xmath2 , depending on envelope mass and core composition , as well as on the assumed value of the equilibrium surface temperature during the constant - mass evolution phase .",
    "these radii are in general in agreement with those observed by _",
    "kepler _ for sub - neptune - type planets .",
    "the values of mass that we calculate fall within the range of observed values for kepler-11 f , with mass 2.0 ( + 0.8 , 0.9 ) m@xmath2 , radius 2.48 ( + 0.02 , 0.03 ) r@xmath2 .",
    "this planet orbits at 0.25 au with an equilibrium temperature of 525 k. the envelope mass is estimated to be about 0.08 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "our models indicate that if the planet had formed _ in situ _ , it could not have accreted enough envelope mass to account for its present radius , even if xuv - driven mass loss were not important . if the actual planet mass were near the one - standard - deviation upper limit ( 2.8 m@xmath2 ) then _ in situ _ formation ( without mass loss ) could have occurred .",
    "on the other hand , some models indicate that substantial mass loss ( @xmath151 m@xmath2 ) from the envelope would have occurred at its present orbital position . in that case , _ in situ _ formation is not possible , and the planet probably formed beyond the snow line at @xmath152 au with a rock / iron / ice core , and , during formation , migrated inward .",
    "if the mass loss at the current orbit were only moderate ( @xmath153 m@xmath2 ) , then the planet could have formed between 1 and 2 au with a rock / iron core , coupled with migration inward . furthermore ,",
    "if the planet formed at 4 au according to the core - nucleated accretion model , the required solid surface density would have been about twice that in the minimum - mass solar nebula . if it had formed _ in situ _",
    ", that density would have to be @xmath154 times that in the mmsn , corresponding to 4 times that in the minimum - mass extrasolar nebula of @xcite .",
