    "hydrodynamic instabilities in accretion flows can help understanding the variability observed in the luminosity of x - ray binaries .",
    "numerical simulations have revealed the existence of such a hydrodynamical instability in the accretion flow of a gas on a compact accretor moving at supersonic velocity ( bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion ) .",
    "a first step towards understanding the physical mechanism underlying this instability was made by foglizzo & tagger ( 2000 , hereafter ft00 ) who recognized the unstable cycle of entropic and acoustic perturbations between the shock and the sonic surface .",
    "this cycle is unstable if there is a large enough temperature difference between the shock and the sonic surface .",
    "the academic case of shocked bondi accretion was studied by foglizzo ( 2001 , hereafter f01 ) who revealed the importance of non radial perturbations , and vorticity in particular .",
    "both vorticity and entropy perturbations are advected from the shock to the accretor , and both are coupled to the acoustic perturbations .",
    "this coupling was formulated in a compact way by howe ( 1975 ) .",
    "if the adiabatic index is in the range @xmath9 , entropy and vorticity perturbations are intimately related in the shocked bondi flow ( foglizzo 2002 , in preparation ) , so that it is difficult to identify their respective roles in the instability mechanism . by contrast",
    ", their roles are well separated in the isothermal limit ( @xmath10 ) , where entropy perturbations are absent from the problem .",
    "the present paper is therefore dedicated to the study of the linear stability of shocked accretion in the isothermal bondi flow , where the incident mach number is the only parameter .",
    "the stability of shocked isothermal flows was studied by nakayama ( 1992 , 1993 ) in the more general context of flows with small angular momentum .",
    "the study of nakayama was restricted to axisymmetric perturbations , thus precluding any possible vortical acoustic cycle . in this approximation ,",
    "nakayama analytically obtained the result that the flow is unstable if the flow accelerates immediately after the shock surface . in this respect",
    "the shocked bondi flow should be unstable .",
    "we are therefore interested here in an extension of nakayama s results to the case of non radial perturbations , in order to include the effect of vorticity .",
    "it should be noted that isothermal flows are very particular as far as bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( hereafter bhl ) accretion is concerned , with unsettled issues concerning the influence of the numerical resolution .",
    "the instability observed in numerical simulations seems very weak in 3-d according to ruffert ( 1996 ) , whereas it is violent in 2-d ( ishii 1993 , shima 1998 ) .",
    "pogorelov ( 2000 ) discussed the possible responsability of the numerical procedure in producing the instability . with a different approach",
