    "at first glance , early - type dwarf galaxies ( des ) are characterized by their smooth appearance , having no recent or ongoing star formation and apparently no gas or dust content .",
    "since they are the most numerous type of galaxy in clusters , it is self - evident that most of the proposed formation scenarios for des reflect the vigorous gravitational forces acting within the very environment in which these galaxies typically reside .",
    "ram - pressure stripping @xcite , galaxy harassment @xcite , and tidal stirring @xcite are all based on the removal of gas and the morphological transformation of a late - type spiral or irregular galaxy , thereby attempting to reproduce the seemingly plain appearance of des . on the other hand ,",
    "differences in the chemical abundances of early - type and late - type galaxies may argue against a simple morphological transformation @xcite . in any case",
    ", such structural transformations would be well - suited to explain the famous morphology - density relation @xcite : the higher the density is , the more efficiently are infalling spirals and irregulars transformed into des , thereby skewing the relative abundance of different types of galaxy towards massive early - type objects as compared to abundances in the field .",
    "moreover , @xcite point out that the number of virgo cluster des is more than a factor of 3 larger than what would be expected from just adding groups to the cluster .",
    "this strongly favours the idea that the majority of des were formed through a morphological transformation of galaxies that fell into the cluster .    especially in recent years",
    ", small or intermediate - sized samples of early - type dwarfs have been studied in a large variety of ways .",
    "@xcite find the relation of far - uv  near - uv colour and luminosity to behave opposite for early - type dwarfs and giants .",
    "van zee et al .",
    "( 2004a ) derive intermediate ages and subsolar to solar metallicities for des via optical multiband photometry .",
    "similar values were reported by @xcite from a lick index analysis of high - resolution spectra .",
    "these spectra and similar studies by @xcite and @xcite also revealed a significant amount of rotation in some des .",
    "finally , @xcite presented hi @xmath2 line observations as a first study of the interstellar medium of a de outside the local group .",
    "however , no formation scenario could yet be clearly confirmed or rejected .",
    "this might be due to a very basic piece of the puzzle still lacking : the unambiguous characterization of early - type dwarf morphology .",
    "following common definition , early - type dwarfs comprise both dwarf ellipticals and dwarf s0 ( ds0 ) galaxies  we are not considering the fainter dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the ultra - compact dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the morphological appearance and overall profile of a dwarf elliptical are clearly defined .",
    "in contrast , ds0 galaxies are loosely defined as objects whose overall appearance is similar to that of a dwarf elliptical , but where a more detailed examination shows non - elliptical properties such as lens shape or ( central ) asymmetries .",
    "@xcite argued that most of these characteristics were indicative of a disk nature , and the authors conjectured that `` many , if not most , ds0 systems must be disk galaxies '' .",
    "however , their existence as a separate class of objects has been put in question by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ds0s have frequently been treated as a subclass of dwarf ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the unambiguous discovery of disk substructure ( spiral arms and/or bars ) in some dwarf ellipticals and ds0s @xcite eventually proved the presence of a disk in at least some early - type dwarfs . at the same time",
    ", however , this raised the question of whether these objects are genuine disk galaxies , i.e.  of flat oblate shape and without significant stellar spheroid , or whether they are spheroids hosting just a small disk component like the two low - luminosity ellipticals presented by @xcite . on the theoretical side , @xcite showed that a fraction of the progenitor galaxy s disk is able to survive the morphological transformation from galaxy harassment , providing a possible explanation for disks in early - type dwarfs .",
    "since up to now , a systematic analysis of a large sample of early - type dwarfs for the presence of disk features has been lacking , common practice has been to continue using the original classification of the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore calling some objects dwarf elliptical , some ds0 , and some dwarf elliptical with embedded disk. in order to avoid confusion we assign the common abbreviation de to early - type dwarfs in general , thereby meaning both dwarf ellipticals and ds0s .",
    "we shall then examine each object for potential disk substructure , and introduce the term dedi for a de with disk features .",
    "clearly , the small sample of dedis discovered so far can neither serve as basis for a revised classification nor is it sufficient to feed formation theories with quantitative input concerning the fraction and properties of such objects .",
    "a systematic search for disk features in des is thus required , and is made possible by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 4 ( dr4 , * ? ? ? * ) which covers almost the whole virgo cluster with multiband optical imaging . with these data at hand",
    ", our study can properly address the following questions : a ) whether all objects listed as ds0 in the vcc indeed show disk features , b ) how large the fraction of galaxies with disk features is among des , c ) how this fraction is distributed with respect to luminosity , d ) where in the cluster these objects are located , and e ) whether they appear to be genuine disk galaxies , or just spheroids with a disk component .",
    "the catalog of dedis and dedi candidates resulting from this study will serve as important input for all future work on des , since the observables under study ( e.g.  de colours ) can then be correlated with the presence or absence of a disk .",
    "recently , @xcite have introduced a two - component definition of a ds0 based on one - dimensional profile fits , with those ( coma cluster ) objects being called ds0s where a single srsic fit did not lead to a satisfying result and instead a combined srsic plus exponential fit was necessary . our goal in this paper , in contrast , is to uncover disk features on the two - dimensional image without any presumption on one - dimensional profile shapes . to investigate whether or not the two definitions go hand in hand is beyond the scope of this paper , since it requires that accurate profile fits be done for all our sdss galaxies",

    "fig : distrnum ] ) .",
    "it provides reduced and calibrated images taken in the u , g , r , i , and z band with a pixel scale of @xmath7 , which corresponds to a physical size of @xmath8 when adopting @xmath9 , i.e.  @xmath10 .",
    "the sdss imaging camera takes data in drift - scanning mode nearly simultaneously in five photometric bands , u , g , r , i , and z , and thus combines very homogeneous multicolour photometry with large area coverage , good resolution , and sufficient depth to enable a systematic analysis of early - type dwarfs .",
    "the images have an absolute astrometric accuracy of @xmath11 per coordinate , and a relative accuracy between the r band and each of the other bands of less than @xmath12 pixels @xcite .",
    "they can thus easily be aligned using their astrometric calibration and need not be registered manually .",
    "the effective exposure time of @xmath13 leads for a bright de ( @xmath14 ) to a typical total signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of about @xmath15 in the r - band within an aperture radius of approximately two half - light radii . for a faint de ( @xmath16 )",
    "this value is typically about @xmath17 .",
    "the rms of the noise per pixel corresponds to a surface brightness of approximately @xmath18 in the u - band , @xmath19 in g , @xmath20 in r , @xmath21 in i , and @xmath22 in z.      in order to reach a higher snr than that of the individual images , we produced a combined image by co - adding the g , r , and i - band images .",
    "the u and z - band images were not used , since their snr is significantly lower and would thus lead to a decrease of the snr of the combined image . when determining the sky level , proper object masks are required , so that pixels containing light from a star or a galaxy are excluded from the sky level calculation and only sky pixels ( i.e.  pixels that contain nothing but sky background ) remain unmasked . for this purpose",
    ", we applied the source extractor software @xcite to each object s image and each band to yield a segmentation image which marks the pixels of all detected sources by assigning them non - zero values . to ensure proper masking of all objects",
    ", we expanded the source areas on the segmentation image by smoothing it with a gaussian filter , using _ _ iraf _ _ @xcite .",

    "the g and i band images were shifted with _",
    "iraf / imshift _ to match the r band image ; shifts were determined from the sdss astrometry provided for each image ( see above ) .",

    "the weighted g , r , and i - band images were then summed to form the final combined image for each object .",
    "the resulting total snr is about a factor of @xmath27 larger than in the r - band image .      from visual inspection of the combined images we chose a magnitude limit of @xmath28 for our study , with @xmath29 provided by the vcc",
    "this is the same magnitude limit up to which the vcc was found to be complete @xcite . adopting @xmath9",
    ", it corresponds roughly to a limit in absolute magnitude of @xmath30 .",
    "a more thorough examination of our limitations in detecting disk features is presented later in section [ sec : limit ] .",
    "initially , we selected all 552 cluster member and possible member galaxies with @xmath31 that were classified as dwarf elliptical or ds0 in the vcc , including those with uncertainties .",
    "we took into account the revised membership and classification from @xcite , as well as updated classifications for several objects given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "25 galaxies are not covered by the sdss dr4 .",
    "25 objects with a classification de / dirr were excluded , and also all the remaining objects were visually examined and excluded if they appeared to be possible dwarf irregulars due to asymmetric features in their image , which applied to 18 galaxies .",
    "thereby we avoid biasing our sample by the inclusion of potential non - early - type objects ( which might be disk galaxies anyway ) .",
    "three more objects ( , , ) were classified as possible cluster members but appear to be probable background spirals because of their small size and their spiral arm structure , and were therefore excluded as well .",
    "five more objects ( , , , , ) are of such low surface brightness that no examination for potential disk features is possible ; these were also excluded .",
    "our final sample comprises 476 early - type dwarfs , 414 of which are definite members of the virgo cluster according to @xcite .",
    "for bringing to light weak features that are hidden by the dominating and mostly smooth and symmetric overall light distribution , two methods have proven suitable .",
    "unsharp masks are a common technique in detecing and enhancing weak substructure like e.g.  nuclear bars or spirals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are produced by first smoothing an image and then dividing the original by the smoothed one , which can easily be performed automatically on a large dataset .",
    "another technique is to model the smooth axisymmetric light distribution of a galaxy and subtract it from the original image ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with non - axisymmetric features like spiral arms remaining . both methods have been used to identify spiral arms , bars , or edge - on disks in eight virgo cluster early - type dwarfs so far ( , , , , , , , ; @xcite ) .",
    "these techniques are described below , along with the derivation of an elliptical aperture for each galaxy , which is required as input for both methods .    from our ongoing analysis of des with blue central regions ( paper ii of this series ) we know that a significant fraction of des where no disk features were detected show obvious colour substructure .",
    "since we analyze the combined images from three bands in our search for disks , it could happen that colour substructure within the galaxy mimics the presence of a disk feature . to test this",
    ", we produced ( uncalibrated ) colour maps by dividing the aligned g and i - band images .",
    "any detection of a disk feature with the methods outlined below can then be compared to the corresponding colour map and can thus be judged for reliability . to investigate whether or not there are any des in which colours do trace disk substructure requires a quantitative colour analysis that will be the subject of a future paper in this series .",
    "an elliptical aperture for each galaxy was determined by performing ellipse fits with _ iraf / ellipse _ on the combined image , allowing center , position angle , and ellipticity to vary .",
    "one of the outer elliptical isophotes  usually between 1 and 2 half - light radii  was then chosen by eye to trace best the _",
    "shape of each galaxy , as exemplified for vcc1010 in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcc1010 ] .",
    "this ellipse was adopted to define the ellipticity and position angle of the galaxy .",
    "we produced a set of unsharp masks for each object by smoothing the combined image with a two - dimensional circular and elliptical gaussian , one at a time , of various kernel sizes @xmath32 .",
    "a small value of @xmath32 will enhance small structures and weaken large features at the same time , while a large kernel size will enhance large structures over small ones .",
    "for each set of unsharp masks we chose values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 pixels . with * @xmath10 * ( @xmath9 ) and a subsequent pixel scale of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , these values correspond to @xmath37 and @xmath38kpc , respectively .",
    "it is desirable to produce both masks created with a circular gaussian ( hereafter referred to as circular masks ) and masks with an elliptical gaussian ( elliptical masks ) corresponding to the galaxy s ellipticity and position angle .",
    "circular masks of non - circular artificial galaxies show a characteristic narrow shape along the major axis that could easily be confused with an edge - on disk and does not occur when applying elliptical masks .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : simul ] , where a de is represented by a two - dimensional exponential surface brightness profile with an elliptical shape created with _ iraf / mkobjects _ ( left panel ) .",
    "a circular unsharp mask with a gaussian kernel of @xmath39 , feigning an edge - on disk , is shown in the middle panel . in the right panel , an elliptical mask with position angle and ellipticity matching that of the galaxy has been applied :",
    "no substructure is seen .",
    "this is due to the fact that the scale radius of the light profile is smaller along the minor axis ; therefore an isotropic gaussian will blur the object much stronger along the minor than along the major axis . for detection of egde - on disk features or bars that are roughly parallel to the major axis , elliptical masks are thus clearly preferred .",
    "however , frequently the inner isophotes of an object are significantly rounder than the outer ones that define the gaussian s ellipticity . in these cases ,",
    "again an artificial narrow ( bar - like ) structure will appear along the _ minor _ axis , due to the very same effect as described above . here ,",
    "circular masks serve as a complementary check whether an apparent elongated feature along the minor axis is real or is only caused by varying ellipticity .      a galaxy s surface brightness distribution can be modeled by performing ellipse fits ( with _ iraf / ellipse _ ) and then feeding the output directly into the task _ bmodel_. the resulting model image is then subtracted from the original object , yielding a residual image .",
    "any information contained in the results of ellipse fitting directly enters the model .",
    "this can nicely be demonstrated on , which hosts a bar .",
    "if we construct a model through ellipse fits with _ variable _ position angle and ellipticity , the bar is not seen at all in the residual image ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcc1010 ] ) since it has been fully reproduced by the model .",
    "if position angle and ellipticity are instead fixed at a value taken well outside the bar ( namely the chosen elliptical aperture as described above ) , a strong residual double - cone is seen ( lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcc1010 ] ) , which has already been explained by @xcite as characteristic shape of a changing position angle , and therefore of a bar .",
    "similarly , spiral arms can be reproduced to a large extent by varying ellipses , and thus do not appear in the residual image unless position angle and ellipticity are kept fixed .    from the above considerations it is obvious that any disk feature can best be detected with a model built through fixed ellipticity and position angle ( later referred to as fixed model ) . however , in principle any _ additional _ weak , asymmetric features would require _ variable _ ellipse parameters ( variable model ) , so that the bar or spiral is properly reproduced in the model and fully subtracted from the image , and the additional substructure remains .",
    "therefore , both types of residual images were visually examined along with the unsharp masks for each object .",
    "in addition to the sdss data we produced artificial de galaxies with _ iraf / mkobjects _ , adopting a two - dimensional exponential surface brightness profile with an elliptical shape ( left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : simul ] ) .",
    "this primary object was then superposed by another secondary exponential light distribution with the same or higher ellipticity , representing an ( inclined ) disk within a spheroid ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twocomp ] ) .",
    "various primary - to - secondary flux ratios , scale ratios , position angles and inclinations were reproduced , in order to provide a model counterpart for real galaxies that potentially are spheroids hosting a disk .",
    "the noise characteristics of the artificial images were chosen to be similar to a typical sdss image , and galaxies covering a range of snr values were created .",
    "close visual inspection of the combined image , the set of unsharp masks , and the two residual images was performed for each galaxy , using the _ saoimage ds9 _",
    "tool @xcite .",
    "it turned out that unsharp masks are the primary means to search for substructure : especially for small elongated features , they often provide a more reliable and clearer detection than the residual images do . in turn , only in very few cases did the residual images show hints of substructure where the unsharp masks did not .",
    "however , in these cases the features were weak and their shape hard to define .",
    "therefore we adopted a conservative approach and did not consider them as possible substructure . as @xcite pointed out , care must be taken with features seen solely on the residual images , since the models can be deceived by e.g.  changing ellipticity and position angle , so that the resulting residual image would feign some substructure where none is present .",
    "furthermore , the variable model turned out to be of little use , since it either reproduces substructure completely and yields a blank residual image ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vcc1010 ] ) , or leaves only weak features that are readily seen in the unsharp masks and the fixed model residual image .",
    "the situation described above that the variable model would bring to light secondary features by reproducing and subtracting the primary ones did not occur , i.e.  no secondary substructure remained in the residual image other than weak and highly doubtful features .",
    "we identified 14 out of 476 early - type dwarfs that unambiguously show disk features , as exemplified in the upper three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pics ] .",
    "moreover , we find probable disks in 10 objects ( third panel from bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : pics ] ) , and possible disks in 17 objects ( lower two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pics ] ) .",
    "this distinction between unambiguous , probable , and possible disks is based on the visual judgement of all three authors , and is intended to be an honest representation of the ( un)ambiguity and the snr of disk features . in the case of a possible edge - on or inclined disk , we used comparisons with artificial two - component galaxies to check whether our interpretation is consistent with such a structure .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : twocomp ] , where the galaxy  classified as probable dedi  is compared to an artificial galaxy consisting of a primary and a secondary component , the latter being fainter and having a larger ellipticity ( i.e.  representing a larger inclination angle ) .",
    "the simulated image is chosen to be similar in snr and size , and indeed the shape of the galaxy images as well as their unsharp masks look similar .    in two cases ( and ) , the colour maps ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] ) show a blue central region that is similar in appearance to the possible disk features . as a further test we produced unsharp masks for the two galaxies from the i - band images only .",
    "however , in both cases we can neither reject nor unambiguously confirm the presence of an inclined disk .",
    "we thus list both objects as showing possible disk features .    in several cases",
    "we could not decide whether we see an edge - on disk or a bar ; nevertheless , both were taken as disk feature , since the presence of a bar commonly requires a disk . moreover , apart from the simple category no substructure detected ( applying to 406 objects listed in appendix [ sec : nodisk ] ) , we labelled 29 galaxies as objects where substructure of some kind is present , but not necessarily indicative of a disk ( other substructure ; objects listed in appendix [ sec : nodisk ] ) .",
    "17 of these show irregular central features ( also see sect .",
    "[ sec : sub_ds0 ] ) , five have a boxy shape , in four objects a feature like a dust lane is seen , and for three objects the unsharp masks appear to show a luminosity excess in the inner part .",
    "of the eight virgo des for which disk features have been reported , five ( , , , , ) are contained in our 14 unambiguous detections , and one ( ) is a probable detection . both ( reported by * ? ? ? * ) and ( reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were not even identified as a dedi candidate by us .",
    "the reason might be twofold : first , those studies ( as well as * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use a boxcar or median filter to create their unsharp masks . as we demonstrated above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : simul ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : sub_masks ] ) , applying such a filter to a perfectly smooth elliptical light distribution will yield an artificial elongated structure in the unsharp mask .",
    "this effect might well apply to with its axial ratio of 0.55 , but less likely to which has an axial ratio of 0.76 .",
    "however , the disk features of both galaxies were also reported to be seen in the residual images resulting from ellipse fits and subsequent modeling of the light distribution . given that both the data from @xcite and from @xcite are of higher depth and resolution than our sdss images , the non - detection of ours might simply reflect our limitations in detecting disks , and shows that more dedis might exist than those identified by us ( see also sects .  [",
    "sec : magdist ] and [ sec : limit ] ) .",
    "we list the dedis and dedi candidates in table [ tab : disks ] .",
    "we do , however , not attempt to reclassify objects , since classification schemes in the vcc were fairly complex and based on the surface brightness distribution , whereas we aim solely at stating whether or not a de s image shows features of a disk . in principle",
    ", it would be desirable to establish a pure definition of the ds0 class as those ( and only those ) des hosting ( or being ) a disk .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible : apart from the fact that many objects can only be termed candidates due to the limited snr , those where no disk was _ found _ do not necessarily have to _ have _ no disk .",
    "it appears therefore most useful to not touch the original vcc classification , but instead to provide a list of ( candidate ) dedis that can be correlated with all sorts of observables in future studies of des .",
    "a thorough reclassification of all galaxies is deferred to a future study .",
    "we point out that our objects are _ not _ related to the so - called dwarf spiral galaxies defined by @xcite : while those have a classical bulge , our objects do not .",
    "@xcite described five cases in which a galaxy was classified ds0 , with characteristics mostly indicative of a disk nature of the galaxy .",
    "briefly , criteria for ds0s were a bulge - disk - like profile , high flattening , a lens - like appearance , a global asymmetry ( like a bar or boxiness ) , and an irregularity in the central part .    our initial sample  prior to exclusion of possibly irregular objects  contained 47 out of 50 galaxies classified as ds0 or candidate ds0 ( e.g.  de or ds0 ) in the vcc .",
    "two objects were then exluded due to a possible irregular nature ; thus 45 ( candidate ) ds0s are left in our working sample .",
    "22 of these are indeed classified by us as dedis or dedi candidates , constituting 54% of our dedi sample .",
    "14 objects have other substructure which reflects the criteria of @xcite : 3 of them have a boxy shape , and 9 show irregular or clumpy central features likely caused by gas and dust . as an example for the latter , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : e8 ] the image and unsharp masks of , which looks somewhat similar to the well - known dwarf elliptical ngc205 in the local group .",
    "interestingly , all of these 9 objects with central gas / dust features have a blue central region with ongoing star formation or at least very young stars , similar to ngc205 and also to the galaxy presented by @xcite .",
    "this nicely confirms binggeli s & cameron s conclusion , `` the irregularity must stem from recent or ongoing star formation '' ( drawn without colour information or unsharp masks ! ) .",
    "none of these galaxies shows ( additional ) disk features ; thus caution must be taken when treating them as dedis only because of their ds0 class : not all classified ds0s are dedis .",
    "these objects might prove highly important for investigating possible formation channels for des ; therefore they will be the subject of paper ii of this series ( lisker et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .    finally , for 9 of the 45 ( candidate ) ds0s , neither a disk nor other substructure was found .",
    "however , three of these are classified de or ds0 , three are ds0? ( i.e.  high uncertainty ) , and two are ds0: ( i.e.  some uncertainty ) ; hence we most probably did not miss any significant disk or irregular substructure .",
    "the one unambiguously classified ds0 ( ) had been classified as such mainly due to high flattening . while our measured axial ratio of 0.33 is small , it is not small enough that we would classify it as dedi based on flattening only",
    "for those three dedis with the best - defined spiral arms , we now attempt to obtain an estimate of the relative amount of light that constitutes the spiral arms , as compared to the smooth and axisymmetrically distributed light .",
    "we thus need to measure the flux of the residual image ( showing only the spiral arms ) within a given aperture , and compare it to the total flux of the galaxy within the same aperture .",
    "we shall term this flux ratio the strength of the spiral features .",
    "however , in the residual image the flux level in between the spiral arms is significantly negative : when fitting ellipses , the average flux value of each elliptical isophote is affected by the spiral arms and thus comes out slightly too high .",
    "consequently , somewhat too much flux is assigned to the smoothly distributed light component , resulting in negative flux values when subtracted from the original image . to avoid or at least minimize this effect",
    ", we obtain optimized residual images through an iterative procedure outlined in detail in appendix [ sec : resiopti ] , yielding a lower and an upper limit for the strength of the residual features .",
    "the resulting residual images for our three dedis are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : strength ] .",
    "note that it is _ not _ the case that our disk detections would have been more efficient if we had used such optimized residual images from the beginning : the _ contrast _ of residual features like spiral arms does not differ with respect to the initial residual images  only the average flux level is offset systematically .",
    "apertures enclosing the spiral arms were now chosen manually , and the strength of the spirals was measured from the residual and the model flux within the same aperture .",
    "the nucleus as well as foreground stars or background objects were masked to avoid any bias .",
    "the results are listed in table [ tab : strength ] : has the strongest spiral features , which amount to 12 - 13% of the total light .",
    "the spiral of constitutes 8 - 11% of the light , and only reaches 6 - 8% .    with these results at hand",
    ", we can now for the first time in the course of this paper address the question of whether dedis are disk galaxies , i.e.  are of flat oblate shape like ( third row in fig .",
    "[ fig : pics ] ) , or whether they are spheroids hosting a disk component .",
    "the ratio of the light within the spiral features to the smoothly distributed light has been measured to be within 6 - 12% for our three galaxies .",
    "therefore , when assuming that these objects are spheroidal galaxies hosting an embedded disk , the total light within the disk can not be much larger than the light within the spiral features , since otherwise the disk would be the dominating component and the object would not be a spheroidal galaxy in the common sense . therefore ,",
    "assuming the light within the spiral features to be of the same order as the total light of the disk component , the above ratio of spiral light to the smoothly distributed light should be comparable to the ratio of the secondary to the primary component in our two - component model images .",
    "if , however , our galaxies would be genuine disk galaxies , the spiral features might well contain just a fraction of the total light of the disk .",
    "consequently , if the disk is seen edge - on and compared to a suitable two - component model image , the ratio of its secondary to primary component should be significantly larger than the value measured for the ( face - on ) spiral features .",
    "indeed , for those dedis with apparent inclined disks that could not be confused with a bar , the secondary component of the similar - looking model images is only 0.5 - 1 magnitudes fainter than the primary component , whereas the spirals measured above are 2.2 - 3.1 magnitudes fainter than the smooth axisymmetric component .",
    "although this is no final proof due to the small number of objects considered , it points towards dedis _ being _ disk galaxies , instead of just _ having _ a disk component .",
    "further arguments supporting this view will be presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : flat ] .",
    "since the strengths of the three spirals measured above already differ within a factor of two , it might be interesting to see how the galaxies images would appear if their spirals were stronger by a certain amount .",
    "for this purpose , we simply multiplied the residual images by a certain factor and added them to the model of the smooth component , thereby mimicking a stronger spiral .",
    "strikingly , with only a 0.5 - 1mag enhancement , the galaxy does not look like a dwarf elliptical or dwarf s0 anymore , but instead like a spiral galaxy , although without a bulge .",
    "it might thus be no coincidence that more than a decade ago , one of us ( b.b . ) identified a handful of `` faint , dwarfish looking s0/sa '' galaxies in the virgo cluster ( , , , , ) whose appearance is very similar to what has been just described ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strength ] ) .",
    "these objects differ from normal ( i.e.  giant ) s0/sa galaxies : their surface brightness profiles are similar to early - type dwarfs and remain flatter than the flattest possible king profile when going inwards , i.e.  they apparently have no bulge ( binggeli , unpublished ) .",
    "thus , they are hardly normal s0/sa galaxies , which typically have a high bulge - to - disk ratio . instead they have a central luminosity excess just like the early - type dwarfs .",
    "one might thus term these objects dwarf - like s0/sa galaxies , to distinguish them from their giant counterparts",
    ". a further investigation of their characteristics and a detailed comparison with early - type dwarfs will be the subject of a future paper in this series . for our present study",
    ", we selected those two with the best - defined spiral structure ( , classified sa , and , classified s0/sa ) , in order to measure the spiral strength like we did above and compare it to the dedis .",
    "their strengths turn out to be slightly larger than the average value of the three dedis and similar to the strongest dedi spiral ( ): 9%-13% for and 11 - 14% for .",
    "both objects are about half a magnitude brighter than the brightest de(di)s .",
    "it thus appears plausible that the dedis and these objects belong to the same population of galaxies that extends to magnitudes brighter than those of des and differs from the classical dwarf ellipticals .      in order to confirm our above hypothesis",
    ", we measured the pitch angle of the spiral arms of both dedis and the dwarf - like s0/sa galaxies on the residual images .",
    "we used the method described by @xcite : a spiral arm is traced by manually selecting a series of image positions that follow the arm .",
    "these are then fitted by a logarithmic spiral , taking into account the galaxy s inclination and position angle which we adopt from our elliptical apertures ( in the case of these values were taken from the axial ratio measurement of the disk ) .",

    "a flattening distribution for our galaxies can be obtained in two ways : for the disk features themselves by directly measuring or estimating their axial ratio , and for the galaxies as a whole , based on their ellipticities . the first distribution  which we shall term the flattening distribution of the disks  serves as a basic test that the features we see are indeed disk features .",
    "this is of particular importance for the inclusion of probable and possible disk features into our working sample of dedis . in order to have a statistically significant sample , e.g.  to derive the luminosity function ( sect .",
    "[ sec : magdist ] ) , we would like to include not only those des with unambiguous disk features , but also those with probable and possible disk features into our dedi working sample .",
    "this requires the flattening distribution of disk features to be consistent with the assumption of an intrinsic flat oblate ( and circular ) shape , which shall be examined in the following subsection .    the flattening distribution of the _ galaxies _  presented below in sect .",
    "[ sec : sub_flatgal ]  serves a different purpose : it will allow us to consider the question of the possible disk nature of the dedis again .",
    "if they were spheroidal galaxies with a ( weak ) disk component , the distribution of axial ratios should be significantly different from that of disk galaxies . in turn , if their flattening distribution would be consistent with them having an intrinsic disk shape , they would very likely be genuine disk galaxies .      although not possible with perfect accuracy , still an estimate of the inclinations of the disks ( not the galaxies )",
    "can be obtained from either the unsharp mask or the residual images .",
    "an ellipse was manually ( by eye ) fitted to the disk using that unsharp mask or residual image where the respective features stand out most prominently ( exemplified in fig .",

    "the results are shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "we take into account all 36 dedis and candidates that are certain cluster members .",
    "galaxies where we can not decide whether we see a bar or an edge - on disk were assigned two values : a lower limit assuming an inclined disk ( solid line ) , and an upper limit from the axial ratio of the galaxy as a whole , assuming the feature was a bar ( dashed line ) .",
    "a theoretical distribution assuming a disk with an intrinsic axial ratio following a narrow gaussian around a mean value @xmath44 with @xmath45 and a randomly distributed inclination is shown as grey solid line for comparison @xcite . within the expected uncertainties for our relatively crude measurements , the observed and theoretical curve",
    "are nicely consistent with each other .",
    "this strongly corroborates the hypothesis that the features we see _ are _ disks , and moreover , it supports the approach of including not only the unambiguous but also the candidate objects into our dedi working sample for the purposes of our analysis . as a further test , we examined the flattening distribution for possible disks only  it turns out to be very similar to the distribution for all dedis .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that most of our possible disk detections actually are disks .",
    "nevertheless we prefer to keep the term possible in order to reflect that uncertainties _ are _ present in our visual identification of disk features .      based on the elliptical apertures described in sect .",
    "[ sec : sub_ellipt ] we put together the distribution of axial ratios of the ( candidate ) dedis , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : axgaldisk ] as running histogram ( black line ) . for comparison",
    ", we show the theoretical curve assuming an intrinsic axial ratio distribution given by a narrow gaussian with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "obviously , there is almost perfect agreement of observed and theoretical distribution , a compelling indication for an intrinsic disk nature of the dedis ! this view gains further support from the comparison with the distribution of des where no disk features were found ( fig .",
    "[ fig : axgalcomp ] ) : these objects are clearly consistent with a population of spheroids , and differ significantly from the dedi distribution .",
    "it thus appears very likely that dedis are genuine disk galaxies . a prototypical representation of how these disk galaxies appear when viewed egde - on might be given by ( third row in fig . [ fig : pics ] ) with its axial ratio of 0.32 .",
    "while @xcite already found ds0s to be significantly flatter than dwarf ellipticals , the difference is even more pronounced for our comparison of dedis and des with no disk detection .",
    "this is explained by the fact that not all ds0s are dedis and vice versa : at least some galaxies that were classified as ds0 might be spheroids ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : sub_ds0 ] ) .",
    "the flattening distribution also allows us to test whether or not _ all _ bright des might actually be dedis , but are not identified as such due to limitations of our detection method . when we modify fig .  [",
    "fig : axgalcomp ] such that only galaxies of the brightest one-(two-)magnitude - interval are considered ( not shown ) , the distribution of des with no disk detection is inconsistent with all of them being dedis as well . therefore , while we might miss _ some _ dedis in our search for disk features as outlined in sect .",
    "[ sec : limit ] , we can exclude the possibility that _ all _ of the brightest des are disk galaxies  a significant number of objects need to be spheroids .",
    "in the upper panel of fig .  [ fig : maghist ] we show the distribution of des and ( candidate ) dedis with respect to their b band magnitude provided by the vcc . for this purpose",
    "we present our data as a running histogram with a bin - width of 10 ( i.e.  @xmath4305 ) .",
    "only galaxies are considered that are certain cluster members according to @xcite , resulting in 414 objects ( light grey shaded histogram ) , containing 36 dedis and candidates ( dark grey shaded ) .",
    "the fraction of ( candidate ) dedis among all des is shown as black solid line : it reaches more than 50% for the brightest objects , and then decreases to few percent at @xmath48 .",
    "this disk fraction might be of special interest , since e.g.  @xcite discuss a potential break in dwarf galaxy structure at @xmath49 , which corresponds to @xmath50 given their @xmath51 .",
    "a plateau is seen in the running histogram ( the luminosity function ) of our full de sample , the position of which coincides very well with the location of the dedis in the diagram . as a test , we subtracted the dedi - counts from those of the full sample , but still a weak bump remains .",
    "however , we need to take into account the fact that we might have missed a significant number of disks in des due to the limitations of our data ( which are assessed in sect . [",
    "sec : limit ] ) .",
    "therefore , we now multiplied the dedi counts with 1.5 to account for the missed ones , and subtracted these counts from those of the full sample .",
    "indeed , the plateau disappears ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : maghist ] ) .    these results  independent of any considerations in previous sections ",
    "suggest very convincingly that dedis are a different population than des with no disk , i.e.  both have different origins not related to each other . taken together with the indications for the disk nature of dedis",
    ", evidence accumulates that dedis are not just dwarf ellipticals with embedded disks , but instead constitute a population of disk galaxies different and independent from classical dwarf ellipticals .    in the following ,",
    "we attempt to estimate the number of disks that are missed by our study , in order to assess whether the above assumption of a factor of 1.5 is realistic . moreover , we attempt to independently show that the decline of the disk fraction is real , and can not be just an effect of limited data quality .",
    "to obtain a realistic estimate for the limitations in detecting disks , we artificially dimmed our objects such that they correspond to des that are fainter by one ( two ) magnitude(s ) , also taking into account the relation of de magnitude and radius @xcite .",
    "this was done on the individual images and is described in more detail in appendix [ sec : dim ] .",
    "the resulting modified images were then coadded like the original data , and unsharp masks were created .",
    "the dimmed objects were then treated as if they were real galaxies that have to be searched for disk features , and the same categories ( unambiguous , probable etc . )",
    "were assigned .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : magfaint1 ] , we focus on the galaxies lying within the brightest one - magnitude - interval ( solid line , filled circles ) . when dimmed by 1 magnitude , they result in the histogram given by the dashed line with crosses , and when dimmed by two magnitudes , the resulting histogram is shown by the dot - dashed line with filled triangles .",
    "this is illustrating the disk fraction we would _",
    "expect _ to see at fainter magnitudes _ if _ the fraction of the brightest one - magnitude - interval of our sample would be constant with magnitude .",
    "the obvious mismatch , along with the already strong decrease in disk fraction _ within _",
    "the brightest one - magnitude - interval itself , suggests that the observed decline in disk fraction is real , and is not due to the limitations of the data .",
    "even if we do not assume the true fraction to be constant , we find down to @xmath52 the observed disk fraction to decline much stronger per one - magnitude - interval than what would be expected from artificial dimming ( see appendix [ sec : dimfraction ] )",
    ".    however , still a fair part of the decline _ is _ likely to be caused by the latter effect : the curve for objects dimmed by 1 magnitude lies at about a factor of 1.2 lower than the original one , and the two - magnitude curve is even a factor of two lower .",
    "this shows that our above estimate of the true number of dedis being larger by 1.5 than what we observe is a useful estimate for the average fraction of missed objects .",
    "still , the issue might be more subtle : if the _ relative strength _ of the disk features was decreasing with magnitude in addition to the snr of the object _ as a whole _ , the estimate from artificially dimming the galaxies would be somewhat too high . while several of the disk features of the artificially dimmed galaxies would still be strong enough to be seen , some of the true observed ones would not .",
    "we examine this possibility in appendix [ sec : dimflat ] , and find that indeed somewhat more dedis than estimated above might be missed at fainter magnitudes due to data limitations . however ,",
    "if the true disk fraction were to decrease to zero this effect would be of minor relevance . although we are not able to give an accurate estimate of the true number fraction of dedis , we point out again that our analysis is consistent with the approximation of multiplying the disk fraction with 1.5 in the lower panel of fig .

    "since there is no unique definition for the latter , we decided to choose a point such that the radius of a circle enclosing all dedis is minimized ( fig .",

    "interestingly , this circle at the same time encloses exactly all the giant ellipticals . for all other types",
    ", we only consider galaxies up to the maximum radius of the dedis , in order to properly compare their clustering properties _ within _ that area .",
    "the fact that other galaxy types extend slightly further outwards might have physical significance , but could also be just due to the relatively small number of dedis as compared to other types . also , a part of it is due to the boundaries of the sdss dr4 coverage , indicated with dashed grey lines in the upper panels of fig .",

    "this is done by populating a ( three - dimensional ) sphere at the distance of the virgo cluster ( taken to be @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath9 ) with the same number of objects as the number of dedis , and then observing the projected distribution of this sphere .",
    "vertical intervals containing all but @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) of monte - carlo - simulated values ( darker grey ) and all but @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , lighter grey ) are shown .",
    "although a sphere is clearly not an ideal representation of the dynamically young and unrelaxed virgo cluster , this simple model is intended to give at least a rough idea of the actual density distribution of the various galaxy classes .",
    "the well - known difference in the distribution of giant ellipticals and spirals or irregulars is clearly visible , and serves as guidance for the question of what constitutes a _ significant _ difference between two galaxy types in the diagram .",
    "the des where no disks were found roughly follow the distribution of giant es and s0s , i.e.  they are less centrally clustered than the es alone but more strongly than spirals and irregulars .",
    "in contrast , dedis lie clearly below this distribution , and for most of the sample they show even less clustering than spirals and irregulars , confirming the impression given by fig .",
    "[ fig : distrmulti ] .",
    "while giant es tend towards the isothermal sphere and spirals and irregulars more or less follow the distribution for constant volume density , dedis even lie beyond the latter  a clear sign for them being not yet virialized , and thus being a population that has experienced fairly recent cluster infall .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also show the resulting distributions when m87 is chosen as cluster center instead ( fig .  [ fig : cumnum_m87 ] ) .",
    "the difference between dedis and des is now slightly less pronounced , but also it now varies somewhat less with radius than before . here",
    "the dedis follow closely the distribution of spirals , and fall within the 1-sigma area of the theoretical distribution for constant volume density  note , however , that a sphere around m87 is clearly no good representation of the virgo cluster s shape .",
    "in contrast to the dedis , des where no disk features were found approach the distribution of e+s0s , and at larger distances reach the distribution of the es alone .",
    "it is a long - standing question how early - type dwarf galaxies form , and whether there is more than one formation channel producing them .",
    "current theories include ram - pressure stripping , galaxy harassment , or in - situ formation .",
    "however , for a proper theoretical approach of de formation , first the characteristics and possible subpopulations of the de class need to be fully understood and unveiled from the observational side .",
    "while the definition of the ds0 class by @xcite implied a disk nature of these objects , the fairly diverse classification criteria had to remain suggestive but not compelling for ds0s being disk galaxies .",
    "the discovery of disk features in a handful of des had not yet been succeeded by a systematic , quantitative study , and could thus not provide significant input for models of de formation .",
    "moreover , kinematics  which might provide further insight into the presence of disks  are well studied only for a relatively small sample of des . with the sdss data at hand",
    ", we performed for the first time a systematic search for disk features in an almost - complete sample of des down to @xmath64 , and found 41 out of 476 objects to show ( possible , probable ) disk features . in the light of the diversity of the early - type dwarfs ,",
    "one of our primary and most important results is that dedis most likely constitute a different galaxy population than des where no disk features are found : the bump in the luminosity function of des ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maghist ] ) is highly unlikely to be an intrinsic characteristic of just a single population , and it is nicely explained by the superposition of dedis and des with no disk features .",
    "therefore , at least two different formation scenarios appear to be required : one for each des with and without disk features .",
    "when the first observations of spiral structure in des were made , galaxy harassment seemed to provide a simple explanation for the apparently embedded disks in dwarf ellipticals : @xcite showed that the progenitor galaxy s disk need not be completely destroyed during the process of transformation , but part of it is left over inside the newly formed dwarf .",
    "however , we point out a main problem with this scenario : how could the observed _ well - defined , early - type _ spiral - arm structure of dedis be reconciled with them having _ late - type _ progenitor spirals with their typically flocculent arm structure ?",
    "figure [ fig : pitch ] directly compares the pitch angle of our objects to that of scd and sd galaxies in the diagram - and shows an obvious mismatch . if one assumes a relatively weak spiral structure for the late - type progenitor that would quickly disappear after star formation ceases , one might conclude that the above harassment scenario could still be valid , provided that the dedi spiral structure is purely of tidal origin , as e.g. suggested by @xcite .",
    "the above question then changes into asking whether such well - defined spiral arms can at all be created through a process like harassment , and what parameters determine their appearance . to confirm that we are not looking at spiral structure traced by regions of star formation",
    ", we examined near - infrared h - band images for vcc0308 and vcc0856 which we obtained through the eso / st - ecf science archive facility .",
    "these images show the very same spiral structure as the optical data , consistent with what would be expected for grand - design , early - type spiral arms .",
    "a detailed examination of the colour properties of the spiral structure will be presented in paper iii of this series ( lisker et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "even without considering a specific formation theory , our data also allow us to address the question of whether dedis are genuine disk galaxies or whether they are spheroids hosting a disk . our distribution of axial ratios for the _ disks _",
    "( i.e.  where we measured the disk features , not the galaxies as a whole ) agrees well with the expected distribution assuming an intrinsic axial ratio of 0.25 ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : axgaldisk ] ) , confirming our general approach to finding disk features in des . more importantly , also the distribution of axial ratios of the _ galaxies _ where disk features were found is nicely consistent with the assumption of their being disk galaxies with an intrinsic axial ratio of 0.35 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : axgaldisk ] ) .",
    "this distribution significantly differs from the distribution of des with no disk features , the latter being consistent with a distribution of genuine spheroids .",
    "we do not see how this could be reconciled with the assumption that dedis themselves are spheroids ",
    "instead , we take these results as compelling indication for dedis being disk galaxies , represented by the edge - on view of ( third row of fig . [",
    "fig : pics ] ) .",
    "could this population of disk galaxies be simply an extension of their giant counterparts ?",
    "the deduced intrinsic thickness of dedis ( 0.35 ) agrees with the corresponding value for giant sa galaxies as given by @xcite ( 0.37 for s0/sa , 0.33 for sa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the measured pitch angles best agree with hubble type sab / sb ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pitch ] ) .",
    "the dwarf - like s0/sa galaxies presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : sub_sa ] could in fact bridge the gap from dedis to giant disk galaxies . here",
    ", the presence or absence of a classical bulge can distinguish between what would be called a giant or a dwarf galaxy .",
    "however , early - type dwarfs are rare in the field environment , while early - type spiral galaxies are preferentially found in the field .",
    "this fundamental observation provides evidence against a close relation of dedis and early - type spirals .",
    "the projected spatial distribution of dedis within the virgo cluster differs significantly from des with no disk features , and implies that the population of dedis is not virialized yet .",
    "thus , if dedis would be the result of a morphological transformation , this should have occured recently .",
    "any spiral structure of the late - type progenitor galaxies would have had to be destroyed during the process , since the spiral arm characteristics of the dedis are incompatible with being remainders from sc / sd spiral galaxies .",
    "while a pure star formation origin of the spiral arms is unlikely ( see above ) , they might originate from the recent galaxy - galaxy interaction that triggered the transformation process .",
    "since such spiral structure would quickly disappear after the interaction ended , one would expect the dedis to still show structural distortions , i.e.  to be less homogeneous in appearance .",
    "moreover , a significant amount of tidal debris should still be present around them .",
    "at least the latter issue could be settled observationally with dedicated deep imaging of dedis and their vicinity .    even before the discovery of the first spiral structure within a de by @xcite , it was obvious from the existence of a ds0 class that treating all early - type dwarfs as one single population of galaxies always bore the risk of mixing objects that might have had different evolutionary histories . with our systematic search for disk features ,",
    "we have now provided several strong indications that early - type dwarfs do indeed consist of two distinct populations of galaxies . therefore , with our results at hand , we strongly recommend that those objects identified by us as ( candidate ) dedis be considered separately from the rest of des in any future study of early - type dwarfs , like e.g.  a study of de colours .",
    "furthermore , one should keep in mind that a significant fraction of the brighter des where we did not _ find _ any disk features might still _ be _ dedis  this possible incompleteness could fake systematic differences between brighter and fainter des .",
    "we also suggest to separately consider objects where we did not find disk features but that have been classified as ds0 in the vcc , since our results confirm that these also differ from ordinary dwarf ellipticals . as a technical recommendation",
    ", we advise caution on the interpretation of substructure that is seen in unsharp mask images created with _",
    "isotropic _ smoothing of a _ non - circular _ object : as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : simul ] , this can lead to artificial elongated features similar to an edge - on disk .",
    "now that the separation between des and dedis has been established , their properties can be analyzed .",
    "given the disk nature of the dedis , a correlation with kinematical studies of early - type dwarfs is an obvious thing to do .",
    "such a correlation has first been investigated by @xcite who found that two out of three rotating des show disk features , yet two out of four non - rotating des have weak disk substructure as well . without going into the details of the kinematical analyses , we compiled results from several studies that state whether or not a de shows significant rotation @xcite .",
    "note that these studies differ in their data properties , their maximum radius for sampling the rotation curve , and their criteria for significant rotation .",
    "18 out of 29 galaxies are found to be not rotationally supported , i.e.  they show no or too slow rotation as compared to the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "4 of these objects ( 22% ) are ( candidate ) dedis .",
    "however , it needs to be stressed that rotation curves are only sampled out to about the half - light radius , which might not be enough for definite statements about rotational support .",
    "3 of those 4 dedis do show significant rotation , but not enough to qualify for being rotationally supported .",
    "of the 11 galaxies that were found to be rotationally supported , 6 ( 55% ) are ( candidate ) dedis .",
    "there is thus a tendency for dedis to be rotationally supported systems , as one would expect for disk galaxies .",
    "the number statistics are consistent with our rough estimate of a third of the dedis being missed in our study when assuming that most or all of them are rotationally supported .",
    "given the different spatial distribution of dedis and des within the cluster , a further issue of interest would of course be their distribution of heliocentric velocities .",
    "these are available for 31 dedis and 162 des where no disks were found .",
    "however , the two distributions do not differ significantly .",
    "since the true threedimensional locations of our galaxies within the cluster are not known , let alone the exact threedimensional structure of the cluster itself , unfortunately no useful conclusion can be drawn here .    to demonstrate how our recommended separation of dedis and the rest can be applied to other studies of early - type dwarfs",

    "[ fig : strader ] the colours of de nuclei derived by @xcite : five objects of this sample are identified by us as dedis , and show redder nucleus colours than the bulk of des . to obtain a clearer relation , it would be desirable to further pin down the possible disk nature of the remaining des where we could not find disk features .",

    "in the residual images obtained in sect .  [ sec : sub_residual ] , the flux level in between the spiral arms is negative : when fitting ellipses , the average flux value of each elliptical isophote is affected by the spiral arms and thus comes out slightly too high ( panel a of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "this results in negative flux values when the model is subtracted from the original image ( panel b ) .",
    "we construct optimized residual images through the following iterative procedure .",
    "where the initial residual image has negative flux values , its flux is set to zero , otherwise it is left unchanged ( panel c ) .",
    "the resulting image is then subtracted from the original galaxy image ( panel d ) , and a new residual image is obtained like before by fitting ellipses , constructing a new galaxy model , and subtracting it from the original image ( panel e ) .",
    "this is repeated nine times iteratively , so that the final ( tenth ) residual image has reached ( or come close to ) a flux level of zero in between the spiral arms ( panel f ) .",
    "a slight variation of this procedure is to smooth the residual image with a @xmath67 pixel median filter each time before the negative flux values are set to zero .",
    "it turns out that the final image of the latter version still has a slightly negative overall flux level , while the version without smoothing yields a slightly positive ( i.e.  too high ) overall value in the residual image .",
    "we therefore use the strength measurement from the version with smoothing as lower limit , and the one without smoothing as upper limit .",
    "in order to artificially dim our objects by 1 ( 2 ) magnitudes , first the object size was decreased by a factor of 1.2 per magnitude with _ iraf / magnify _ , preserving the total flux .",
    "this follows the relation of magnitude and radius of the des @xcite : on average , the radius decreases with a roughly a factor of 1.2 per magnitude . since this demagnification also affects the psf , the image was then convolved with a ( normalized ) moffat kernel of proper size so as to approximately reproduce the original sdss psf ( taken to be @xmath68 ; * ? ? ? * )",
    ". we then added noise to the image , with a @xmath32 larger by 2.51 ( 6.56 ) compared to the original noise , thereby simulating the snr of the 1 ( 2 ) magnitude fainter object . to increase the noise @xmath32 by 1 magnitude",
    ", one would actually need to add noise with @xmath69 .",
    "however , since the original noise has already been weakened by demagnifying the image , we chose to use @xmath70 as a conservative approximation instead .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : magfaint2 ] we show a running histogram of the observed disk fraction ( solid line with filled circles ) and of the fraction obtained after dimming all objects by 1 magnitude ( dashed line with crosses ) .",
    "the original disk fraction lies clearly below the shifted one until the region where both become very small and are affected by small number statistics .",
    "it is important to point out that fig .",
    "[ fig : magfaint2 ] does _ not _ show how many dedis would be detected assuming a constant true disk fraction .",
    "instead , since all objects are dimmed by an equal amount ( namely 1 magnitude ) , it shows the disk fraction that we would expect to find at a magnitude @xmath71 when starting from the observed fraction at @xmath72 and artificially dimming the objects there .",
    "thus , any difference between the observed value at @xmath72 and the expected value at @xmath71 is due to data limitations only .",
    "this is symbolized by the arrows in the figure .",
    "consequently , if the observed decline from @xmath72 to @xmath71 is stronger than this expected one , at least part of it has to be real and be not only due to data limitations .",
    "the ratio between the two curves thus tells us how much stronger the observed decline _ per one - magnitude - interval _ is compared to what artificial dimming of the galaxies would predict .",
    "we plot this ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : magfaint2 ] as grey solid line . until @xmath52  where the number of dedis becomes very small  for each one - magnitude - step the observed disk fraction declines a factor of 1.5 - 2.2 stronger than the expected one from limitations of our data only .",
    "this clearly shows that the decline of the disk fraction is real .",
    "apparent axial ratios of disk features were not only measured on the original images , but also on those where the galaxies had been artificially dimmed , in order to reveal potential changes in the flattening distribution with magnitude . in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : axhist ] we compare the distribution of disk axial ratios for both the observed ( black ) and the artificially dimmed ( grey ) galaxies that lie within the brightest one - magnitude - interval of our sample . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : axgaldisk ] , solid lines are derived from lower limits of the axial ratios , dashed lines from upper limits , depending on the interpretation of an elongated feature as a bar or as an edge - on disk .",
    "both curves are normalized to an area of 1 .",
    "they show a tendency for the dimmed objects towards lower axial ratios , indicating that the ( artificial ) dimming of objects might slightly prefer disks of certain inclinations over others .",
    "however , the distribution of axial ratios for the galaxies of the _ observed _ second - brightest one - magnitude - interval is much more clearly skewed towards smaller axial ratios , i.e.  larger inclinations ( solid line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : axhist ] ) .",
    "while the upper panel suggests that part of this is due to the effect of the snr on the detectability of features like spiral arms , it might also be that such features are intrinsically weaker  or not even present  in fainter objects .",
    "for example , the observed second - brightest one - magnitude - interval does not contain objects that look like the close - to - face - on spirals in all of , , and , although it does contain galaxies with weaker spiral features that have a larger inclination .",
    "note , however , that the black histogram in the upper panel consists of 16 objects , and both the grey histogram and the black histogram in the lower panel consist of only 13 objects .",
    "therefore , the axial ratio distributions could at least to some extent be affected by small number statistics .",
    "we emphasize that the above effects on the axial ratio of the _ disk _ features need not go hand in hand with the axial ratios of the _ galaxies _ : as an example , the weak spiral arms in are not seen anymore when the galaxy is dimmed by one magnitude .",
    "one could then confuse the bar with being an inclined disk and thus measure a much smaller axial ratio of the disk feature , while the galaxy s axial ratio is the same in both cases .",

    "<S> we present a systematic search for disk features in 476 virgo cluster early - type dwarf ( de ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first such study of an almost - complete , statistically significant de sample which includes all certain or possible cluster members with @xmath0 that are covered by the optical imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 . </S>",
    "<S> disk features ( spiral arms , edge - on disks , or bars ) were identified by applying unsharp masks to a combined image from three bands ( g , r , i ) , as well as by subtracting the axisymmetric light distribution of each galaxy from that image . </S>",
    "<S> 14 objects are unambiguous identifications of disks , 10 objects show probable disk features , and 17 objects show possible disk features . </S>",
    "<S> the number fraction of these galaxies , for which we introduce the term dedi , reaches more than 50% at the bright end of the de population , and decreases to less than 5% for magnitudes @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> although part of this observed decline might be due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio at fainter magnitudes , we show that it can not be caused solely by the limitations of our detection method </S>",
    "<S> . the luminosity function of our full de sample can be explained by a superposition of dedis and ordinary des , strongly suggesting that dedis are a distinct type of galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the projected spatial distribution : dedis show basically no clustering and roughly follow the spatial distribution of spirals and irregulars , whereas ordinary des are distributed similarly to the strongly clustered e / s0 galaxies . while the flattening distribution of ordinary des is typical for spheroidal objects , the distribution of dedis is significantly different and agrees with their being flat oblate objects . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the dedis are not spheroidal galaxies that just have an embedded disk component , but are instead a population of genuine disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> several dedis display well - defined spiral arms with grand design features that clearly differ from the flocculent , open arms typical for late - type spirals that have frequently been proposed as progenitors of early - type dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of what process is able to create such spiral arms  with pitch angles like those of sab / sb galaxies  in bulgeless dwarf galaxies . </S>"
