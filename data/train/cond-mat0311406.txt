    "much more interesting phenomena occur in bilayer qh systems due to exchange interactions .",
    "for instance , an anomalous tunneling current has been observed@xcite between the two layers at the zero bias voltage .",
    "it may well be a manifestation of the josephson - like phenomena predicted a decade ago@xcite .",
    "they occur due to quantum coherence developed spontaneously across the layersezawa92ijmpb , ezawa97b , moon95b .",
    "electrons in a plane perform cyclotron motion under strong magnetic field @xmath1 and create landau levels .",
    "when one landau level is filled up the system becomes incompressible , leading to the integer qh effect . in qh systems the electron position is specified solely by the guiding center @xmath2 subject to the noncommutative relation , @xmath3=-i\\ell _ { b}^{2}$ ] , with the magnetic length @xmath4 . the qh system provides us with a simple realization of noncommutative geometry .",
    "it follows from this relation that each electron occupies an area @xmath5 labelled by the landau - site index .",
    "electrons behave as if they were on lattice sites , among which exchange interactions operate .    in qh ferromagnets charged excitations are spin textures called skyrmions@xcite .",
    "skyrmions are identified experimentallybarrett95l , aifer96l , schmeller95l by measuring the number of flipped spins per one quasiparticle .",
    "indeed , by tilting samples , the activation energy increases by the zeeman effect , which is roughly proportional to the number of flipped spins . on the contrary , an entirely opposite behavior has been observed by murphy et al.@xcite in the bilayer qh system at the filling factor @xmath0 , where the activation energy decreases rapidly by tilting samples .",
    "it is called the activation energy anomaly because of this unexpected behavior .",
    "note that we expect an increase since the @xmath0 bilayer qh system is a qh ferromagnet with spins spontaneously polarized .",
    "this anomalous decrease has been argued to occur due to the loss of the exchange energy of a pseudospin texture based on the bimeron modelmoon95b , where the spin degree of freedom is frozen . here ,",
    "the layer degree of freedom is referred to as the pseudospin : it is said to be up ( down ) when an electron is in the front ( back ) layer .",
    "we investigate physics taking place in the lowest landau level ( lll ) .",
    "since each landau site can accommodate four electrons with the spin and layer degrees of freedom , the underlying group structure is enlarged to su(4 ) .",
    "let us call it the isospin su(4 ) in contrast to the spin su(2 ) and the pseudospin su(2 ) .",
    "we study charged excitations in the @xmath0 bilayer qh system .",
    "a natural candidate is the su(4 ) isospin texture to be identified with the su(4 ) skyrmion@xcite . a specific feature of the su(4 )",
    "isospin texture is that it is reduced to the spin and pseudospin textures in certain limits .    at @xmath0 , electrons are transferable between the two layers continuously without breaking the qh effect@xcite .",
    "namely , the bilayer qh system can be continuously brought into the monolayer qh system by changing the density imbalance .",
    "it implies that a pseudospin texture at the balanced point must be continuously transformed into a spin texture at the monolayer point .",
    "it is natural that a pseudospin texture evolves into an isospin texture and then regresses to a spin texture in this process .",
    "the corresponding continuous transformation of the activation energy has already been observed experimentally by sawada et al.sawada97ssc,sawadax03pe,terasawa04 . in this paper",
    "we explain these experimental data@xcite based on the excitation of su(4 ) skyrmions .    in section ii",

    "iv the ground state is explored in the regime where the su(4 ) isospin coherence develops spontaneously .",
    "it is shown that the capacitance energy consists of two terms arising from the direct interaction , which is the standard one made of two planes , and from the exchange interaction , by way of which the capacitance energy becomes considerably smaller than the standard one for a small layer separation .    in section",
    "v the excitation energy of an electron - hole pair is calculated exactly .",
    "a hole ( electron ) is the small size limit of a skyrmion ( antiskyrmion ) , which is realized when the zeeman gap @xmath6 and the tunneling gap @xmath7 are very large .",
    "the exchange energy is very different whether the pair excites the spin or the pseudospin . due to this difference",
    "the pseudospin excitation occurs at the balanced point even if the tunneling gap is quite large .",
    "our result explains why pseudospin flips were observed in the experiment due to terasawa et al.@xcite  in a sample having a very large tunneling gap ( @xmath8k ) . in section",

    "a spin texture ( spin - skyrmion ) and a pseudospin texture ( ppin - skyrmion ) are special limits of an su(4 ) skyrmion .",
    "we estimate the excitation energy of one su(4 ) skyrmion . we show that , if a ppin - skyrmion is excited at the balanced point , it evolves continuously into a spin - skyrmion at the monolayer point via an su(4 ) skyrmion as the density imbalance is increased between the two layers .    in section",
    "ix we investigate the activation energy anomaly by applying the parallel magnetic field between the two layers .",
