    "wireless optical communications ( uwoc ) has recently been introduced for a number of demands in various underwater applications due to its scalability , reliability and flexibility . compared with its traditional counterpart , namely acoustic communication , optical transmission",
    "has three main advantages : higher bandwidth , better security and lower time latency . owing to these advantages ,",
    "uwoc system can be exploited in a variety of applications such as imaging , real - time video transmission , high throughput sensor networks , etc .",
    "hence , it can be considered as an alternative to meet requirements of high speed and large data underwater communications @xcite .    despite all of the aforementioned advantages ,",
    "uwoc is only appropriate for short range communications ( typically shorter than @xmath5 m ) with realistic average transmit powers .",
    "studies of light in water have shown that optical beam propagation through water suffers from three major impairing phenomena , namely absorption , scattering , and turbulence @xcite .",
    "various studies have been carried out to theoretically and experimentally characterize absorption and scattering effects of different water types @xcite .",
    "for example , mathematical modeling of an uwoc channel and its performance evaluation using radiative transfer theory have been presented in @xcite .",
    "based on experimental results in @xcite , tang _",
    "et al . _ @xcite simulated the uwoc channel by means of monte carlo ( mc ) approach with respect to the effects of absorption and scattering .",
    "they also fitted a double gamma function ( dgf ) to this impulse response and numerically evaluated the system ber , neglecting the turbulence effects .",
    "furthermore , a cellular underwater wireless network based on optical code division multiple access ( ocdma ) technique has recently been proposed in @xcite where potential applications and challenges of such a network is discussed in @xcite . besides , beneficial application of serial relaying on the performance of ocdma - based underwater users and also point - to - point uwoc links is investigated in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . unlike acoustic links , where multipath reflection induces fading on the acoustic signals , in uwoc systems optical turbulence is the major cause of fading on the propagating optical signal through turbulent seawater @xcite .",
    "optical turbulence occurs as a result of random variations of refractive index .",
    "these random variations in underwater medium mainly result from fluctuations in temperature and salinity , whereas in atmosphere they result from inhomogeneities in temperature and pressure changes @xcite .",
    "although , many valuable studies have been done to characterize and mitigate turbulence - induced fading in free - space optical ( fso ) communications @xcite , investigation of its impairing effects on the performance of uwoc systems has received relatively less attention . however , recently some useful results have been reported in literature to characterize underwater fading statistics .",
    "a precise power spectrum has been derived in @xcite for fluctuations of turbulent seawater refractive index .",
    "based on this power spectrum , statistical properties of gaussian beam propagating through turbulent water have been studied by korotkova _",
    "also tang _",
    "@xcite have shown that temporal correlation of irradiance may be introduced by moving medium and they investigated temporal statistics of irradiance in moving ocean with weak turbulence .",
    "moreover , rytov method has been applied in @xcite to evaluate the scintillation index of optical plane and spherical waves propagating in underwater turbulent medium . furthermore in @xcite ,",
    "the on - axis scintillation index of a focused gaussian beam has been formulated in weak oceanic turbulence and by considering log - normal distribution for intensity fluctuations , the average ber is evaluated .        in spite of",
    "all valuable presented works in various aspects of uwoc , a comprehensive study on the performance of uwoc systems that takes all degrading effects of the channel into account , is missing in the literature .",
    "the research in this paper is inspired by the need to comprehensively evaluate the ber of uwoc systems with respect to all impairing effects of the channel and also to design an uwoc system supporting longer range communications with realistic transmit powers .",
    "spatial diversity technique , i.e. , exploiting multiple transmitter / receiver apertures ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , not only compensates for fading effects , but can also effectively decrease the possibility of temporary blockage of the optical beam by obstruction ( e.g. , fishes ) .",
    "another advantage of spatial diversity is in reducing the transmit power density by dividing the total transmitted power by the number of transmitters . in other words , depending on the used wavelength there exist some limitations on the maximum allowable safe transmit power .",
    "hence , by employing spatial diversity one can increase the total transmitted power by the number of transmitters and therefore support longer distances , while maintaining the safe transmit power density @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we analytically obtain the ber expressions for mimo - uwoc systems , when either optimal combiner ( oc ) or equal gain combiner ( egc ) is used .",
    "we also apply photon - counting approach to evaluate the ber of various configurations . in order to take into account the absorption and scattering effects",
    ", we obtain the channel impulse response by mc simulations similar to @xcite . to characterize fading effect , we multiply the above impulse response by a fading coefficient modeled as a log - normal random variable ( rv ) for weak oceanic turbulence @xcite . in addition to the exact ber calculation",
    ", we also evaluate the upper bound on the system ber . in our numerical results",
    "we consider both spatially independent and spatially correlated links .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review some necessary theories in the context of our proposed mimo - uwoc system and the channel under consideration in this paper . in section iii , we analytically obtain both the exact and the upper bound ber expressions , when either oc or egc is used at the receiver side",
    ". we also apply gauss - hermite quadrature formula to effectively calculate multi - dimensional integrals with multi - dimensional finite series . in order to evaluate the system ber using photon - counting methods , the same steps as section iii",
    "are followed in section iv .",
    "section v presents the numerical results for various system configurations and parameters considering log - normal distribution for fading statistics of the uwoc channel , and section vi concludes .",
    "in this section , we present the channel model which includes all three impairing effects of the medium , followed by the assumptions and system model that we have introduced in this paper .",
    "propagation of optical beam in underwater medium induces interactions between each photon and seawater particles either in the form of absorption or scattering .",
    "absorption is an irremeable process where photons interact with water molecules and other particles and lose their energy thermally . on the other hand , in the scattering process",
    "each photon s transmit direction alters , which also can cause energy loss since less photons will be captured by the receiver aperture .",
    "energy loss of non - scattered light due to absorption and scattering can be characterized by absorption coefficient @xmath6 and scattering coefficient @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 denotes the wavelength of the propagating light wave . moreover ,",
    "total effects of absorption and scattering on the energy loss can be described by extinction coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "these coefficients can vary with source wavelength @xmath10 and water types @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that absorption and scattering have lowest effects at the wavelength interval of @xmath11 nm @xmath12 nm .",
    "hence , uwoc systems apply the blue / green region of the visible light spectrum to actualize data communication",
    ".    in @xcite the channel impulse response has been simulated based on mc method with respect to the absorption and scattering effects .",
    "we also simulate the channel impulse response similar to @xcite relying on mc approach . in this paper , the fading - free impulse response between the @xmath13th transmitter and the @xmath14th receiver is denoted by @xmath15 . as it is elaborated in @xcite ,",
    "when the source beam divergence angle and the link distance increase the channel introduces more inter - symbol interference ( isi ) and loss on the received optical signal .",
    "on the other hand , increasing the receiver field of view ( fov ) and aperture size increases the channel delay spread but decreases its loss .      in the previous subsection we described how",
    "the absorption and scattering effects are characterized .",
    "to take turbulence effects into account , we multiply @xmath16 by a multiplicative fading coefficient @xmath17 @xcite , with log - normal distribution for weak oceanic turbulence @xcite . to model",
    "turbulence - induced fading let @xmath18 be the fading amplitude of the channel with log - normal probability density function ( pdf ) as @xcite ; @xmath19 therefore , the fading log - amplitude @xmath20 has a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath21 and variance @xmath22 . to ensure that fading neither amplifies nor attenuates the average power , we normalize fading amplitude such that @xmath23=1 $ ] , which implies @xmath24 @xcite . in order to thoroughly describe fading statistics of uwoc channels we should find out the dependency of log - amplitude variance to the ocean turbulence parameters .",
    "the scintillation index of a light wave is defined by @xcite ; @xmath25 in which @xmath26 is the instantaneous intensity at a point with position vector @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the propagation distance and @xmath29 denotes the long - time average . assuming weak turbulence , the scintillation index of plane and spherical waves can be obtained as @xcite ; @xmath30   \\right \\}d\\kappa d\\xi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 for plane and spherical waves , respectively . @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the wave number and scalar spatial frequency , respectively ; and @xmath35 is the power spectrum of turbulent fluctuations which has the form @xcite ; @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\   & \\times\\frac{{\\chi } _ t}{w^2}\\left(w^2e^{-a_t\\delta } + e^{-a_s\\delta } -2we^{-a_{ts}\\delta } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid which can vary in the range of @xmath38 @xmath39 to @xmath40 @xmath41 @xcite , @xmath42 m is the kolmogorov micro - scale , @xmath43 is the rate of dissipation of mean - square temperature that can take on values between @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath45 @xcite , and @xmath47 ( unitless ) denotes the relative strength of temperature and salinity fluctuations which in ocean waters takes on values in the interval @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "when dominant fluctuations are due to temperature or salinity , @xmath47 takes the values close to @xmath49 or @xmath32 , respectively @xcite .",
    "other parameters are as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite . for log - normal turbulent channels the scintillation index relates to the log - amplitude variance as @xmath54 @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the scintillation index of plane and spherical waves has been evaluated numerically versus communication distance @xmath28 for various values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . from these references",
    "it has been concluded that as @xmath47 and @xmath43 increase the scintillation index also increases ; however for larger values of @xmath56 smaller values of scintillation index are expected .",
    "depending on these parameters , strong turbulence ( which corresponds to @xmath57 @xcite ) can occur at distances as long as @xmath5 m and as short as @xmath58 m , which impressively differs from atmospheric channels where strong turbulence distances are on the order of kilometers @xcite .",
    "therefore , mitigating such a strong turbulence demands more attention .",
    "we consider an uwoc system where the information signal is transmitted by @xmath59 transmitters , received by @xmath60 apertures and combined using oc / egc . as it is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , optical signal through propagation from the @xmath13th transmitter @xmath61 to the @xmath14th receiver @xmath62 experiences absorption , scattering and turbulence , where in this paper absorption and scattering are modeled by fading - free impulse response of @xmath15 ( as discussed in section ii - a ) and turbulence is characterized by a multiplicative fading coefficient @xmath17 , which has a log - normal distribution for weak oceanic turbulence ( as investigated in section ii - b ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath61 to @xmath62 channel has the aggregated impulse response of @xmath63 .",
    "we assume ook signaling where the  on \" state signal will be transmitted with the pulse shape @xmath64 . in the special case of rectangular pulse , @xmath64 can be represented as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the bit duration time and @xmath67 is a rectangular pulse with unit amplitude in the interval @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the transmitted signal can be expressed as ; @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath71th time slot transmitted bit .",
    "hence , the received optical signal after propagating through the channel can be represented as ; @xmath72 in which @xmath73 is the channel fading - free impulse response and @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the convolution operator .",
    "when @xmath59 transmitters are used , in order to have a fair comparison with the single transmitter case , we assume that the total transmitted power for  on \" state signal is yet @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the transmitted power by @xmath61 . in this regard , we denote the transmitted pulse from @xmath61 by @xmath78 and also a sequence of data signal from @xmath61 is denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "this signal reaches @xmath62 after propagation through the channel with impulse response of @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the transferred optical signal from @xmath61 to @xmath62 will be as follows ; @xmath81 where @xmath82 . at the @xmath14th receiver ,",
    "transmitted signals from all transmitters are captured , each with its own channel impulse response . in other words , received optical signal at the @xmath14th receiver is as @xmath83 @xcite . moreover , in order to have a fair comparison between multiple receivers and single receiver cases , we assume that sum of all receiving apertures in multiple receivers scheme is equal to the receiver aperture size of single receiver scheme .",
    "we should emphasize that all of the expressions in the rest of this paper are based on @xmath84 , which is in terms of @xmath85 and @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , our analytical expressions are applicable for any form of power allocation between different transmit apertures , any pulse shape of transmitted signal @xmath85 , and any channel model .",
    "however , our numerical results are based on equal power allocation for transmitters , i.e. , @xmath86 , rectangular pulse for ook signaling , mc - based simulated channel impulse response and log - normal distribution for fading statistics .",
    "in this section , we analytically derive the exact and the upper bound ber expressions for both single - input single - output ( siso ) and mimo schemes , when either oc or egc is used .",
    "various noise components , i.e. , background light , dark current , thermal noise and signal - dependent shot noise all affect the system performance .",
    "since these components are additive and independent of each other , in this section we model them as an equivalent noise component with gaussian distribution @xcite . also as it is shown in @xcite , the signal - dependent shot noise has a negligible effect with respect to the other noise components .",
    "hence , it is amongst the other assumptions of this section to consider the noise variance independent to the incoming signal power .",
    "moreover , we assume symbol - by - symbol processing at the receiver side , which is suboptimal in the presence of isi @xcite . in other words , the receiver integrates its output current over each @xmath66 seconds and then compares the result with an appropriate threshold to detect the received data bit . in this detection process",
    ", the availability of channel state information ( csi ) is also assumed for threshold calculation .      in siso scheme ,",
    "the photodetector s @xmath32th time slot integrated current can be expressed as to @xmath87 seconds which implies that thousands up to millions of consecutive bits have the same fading coefficient .",
