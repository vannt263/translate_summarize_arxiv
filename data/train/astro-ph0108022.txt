    "star formation involves both coherent and incoherent gas motions within molecular clouds .",
    "coherent motions are those with an implicitly common directionality , and include the infall , outflow , and rotational motions of molecular gas associated with extremely young protostellar objects ( mardones et al .",
    "1997 , henceforth m97 ) ; gregersen et al . 1997 ; bontemps et al . 1996 ; ohashi et al .",
    "incoherent motions have no directionality and appear random , and include thermal motions within molecular gas and nonthermal motions of turbulence ( i.e. , randomly propagating mhd waves ; arons & max 1975 ) .",
    "understanding gas motions is crucial to understanding the overall flow of mass during the star formation process , and this is typically attempted by analyzing molecular gas line profiles . in practice , however , different types of motion can be difficult to distinguish because similar line profiles can be produced when different molecular gas motions are projected along the line - of - sight .",
    "for example , asymmetrically - blue optically - thick lines relative to symmetric optically - thin lines have been interpreted recently as evidence for infall motions in several molecular cloud cores ( e.g. , see leung & brown 1977 ; zhou et al .",
    "however , outflow or rotational motions of molecular gas can also produce such a signature , especially at velocities that are low relative to the systemic velocity ( see adelson & leung 1988 ; cabrit & bertout 1986 ) .",
    "in addition , thermal and nonthermal motions each act to broaden line widths , and together can potentially obscure signatures of other motions .",
    "analysis of the gas motions associated with star formation is further complicated by the fact that stars form in groups .",
    "for example , young stars are found by number more in close proximity within massive , turbulent cloud cores ( as in orion , perseus , or ophiuchus ) than in isolation in less - massive , non - turbulent cores ( as in taurus or lupus ; see lada , strom , & myers 1993 ) . given the finite resolutions of millimeter telescopes , the apparent proximity on the sky of several protostellar objects within a group can confuse the relationships between observed molecular gas motions and individual objects , especially in more distant regions .",
    "millimeter interferometers can minimize the problems of ascribing various types of motion to gas within regions where groups of young stellar objects are forming , by providing high - resolution observations of judiciously - chosen molecular lines .",
    "for example , lines observed at high resolution can yield profiles that are less ambiguous in interpretation .",
    "furthermore , the high resolution can allow a better determination of the spatial association of gas with specific objects in a crowded field .",
    "in addition , high - resolution observations can reveal strikingly the abundance contrasts between outflowing and non - outflowing gas , so observing species particularly abundant in either of these components can better trace its specific motions .    in this paper , we present millimeter interferometer observations of the ngc 1333 iras 4 region in the l1430 core of perseus to probe the individual coherent and incoherent motions associated with a small group of protostellar objects .",
    "ngc 1333 itself is a region forming many protostellar groups , and has a 350 pc distance ( herbig & jones 1983 ) .    iras 4 consists of 4 ( or more ) very - embedded objects located within a 30   ( 0.05 pc ) radius , all @xmath03  ( 0.3 pc ) southeast of svs 13 .",
    "iras 4 was discovered by jennings et al .",
    "( 1987 ) as a single iras source , and later resolved by sandell et al .",
    "( 1991 ) into 4a and 4b , separated by 30 .",
    "although 4a and 4b together were considered one of the first ",
    "protobinaries \" ever detected ( see mathieu 1994 ) , each object is itself multiple .",
    "iras 4a was resolved into 4a and 4a , with 2  separation , by lay , carlstrom & hills ( 1995 ) , and iras 4b was resolved into two objects , 4b and 4b , with 10separation , by looney , mundy & welch ( 2000 ) .",
    "the 4b object itself also may be a binary or triple system of @xmath605 separation , although this remains uncomfirmed .",
    "the 4b  object has been named differently by other groups who detected it contemporaneously , i.e. , 4bii by smith et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , 4be by sandell & knee ( 2000 ) , and 4c by looney et al . and choi , panis & evans ( 1999 ) .",
    "we name the object 10  east of 4b as 4b  because 4c was used by rodriguez , anglada & curiel ( 1999 ) and sandell & knee to name a millimeter object @xmath040  east - by - northeast of 4a .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of 4a and 4b are both very red , suggesting that iras 4 consists of several  class 0 \" objects , each at the earliest observed stage of protostellar evolution ( i.e. , @xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 years or less ; see andr , ward - thompson & barsony 1993 ) .",
    "iras 4 has been identified previously as a site of outflow and possibly infall in a turbulent region forming clusters . using single - dish observations of numerous millimeter and submillimeter emission lines , blake et al .",
    "( 1995 , henceforth b95 ) probed abundance depletions and enhancements in the gas associated with 4a or 4b .",
    "low velocity line emission ( i.e. , at @xmath10 @xmath8 12 km s@xmath1",
    "relative to the systemic velocity ) revealed a non - outflowing gas component around each source , with abundance depletions by factors of 1020 ( relative to dust ) due to the adsorption of molecules onto grains at the high densities ( @xmath11 = 2 @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) and low temperatures ( @xmath15 = 20 - 40 k ) of the gas surrounding each object . the profiles of some optically - thick lines seen by b95 were asymmetrically - blue , suggesting these gas components were infalling .",
    "outflowing gas around each source was also detected from line wings seen at higher relative velocities .",
    "qualitative differences in the outflows were found between sources , e.g. , the 4a outflow extended 4  tip - to - tip in co and 1  tip - to - tip in cs , but the 4b outflow extended only @xmath620  in either tracer . despite these differences ,",
    "however , abundance enhancements ( relative to co ) were found in both outflows for several molecules including h@xmath2co , cs , and ch@xmath16co , likely due to the return of grain mantles to the gas phase from grain - grain collisions within outflow shear zones .",
    "further evidence for infall motions at 4a and 4b were obtained from the asymmetrically - blue profiles of h@xmath2co 2@xmath31@xmath17 and cs 21 by m97 , and hco@xmath5 43 and hco@xmath5 32 by gregersen et al .",
    "mardones ( 1998 , henceforth m98 ) further mapped iras 4 in h@xmath2co 2@xmath31@xmath17 and h@xmath2co 3@xmath32@xmath17 and found asymmetrically - blue profiles throughout the region , but the most extreme self - absorptions were found at the positions of 4a and 4b ( see also mardones et al .",
    "choi , panis & evans mapped iras 4 in hco@xmath5 10 and hcn 10 , and again found asymmetrically - blue emission profiles at the positions of each protostellar object .",
    "in addition , small redshifted absorption dips were seen in their hcn spectrum toward 4a , arising from infalling gas along the line - of - sight .",
    "we describe our millimeter interferometer observations in  2 .",
    "a description of the h@xmath2co 3@xmath32@xmath17 , cs 32 , and n@xmath2h@xmath5 10 data is presented in  3 .",
    "discussion of the infall and outflow motions revealed by h@xmath2co and the rotational and turbulent motions revealed by n@xmath2h@xmath5 follows in  4 . in  5 , a concluding summary is presented .",
    "an appendix describes the continuum data and the relative millimeter seds of 4a , 4b , and 4b .",
    "iras 4 was observed between july 1997 and march 1998 at the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) , nro nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) , and the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "table 1 lists the wavelengths , frequencies , configurations , and dates of observations made with each array , as well as the synthesized beam fwhms and the 1 @xmath18 ( rms ) continuum sensitivities obtained from combining all respective tracks .        at the iram pdbi , h@xmath2co 3@xmath32@xmath17 at 225.7 ghz was observed to trace infall or outflow motions in the region , following m97 or b95 but using other h@xmath2co transitions and at higher resolution .",
    "dense gas can be traced by this line , as its critical density @xmath19 @xmath8 7 @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ( from green 1991 ) , but h@xmath2co may be depleted in dense gas surrounding protostellar objects and enhanced in outflows ( see b95 ) .",
    "in addition , n@xmath2h@xmath5 10 at 93.17 ghz was observed to trace non - outflowing dense gas in iras 4 , following m97 but at higher resolution .",

    "therefore , we expect h@xmath2co or cs traces better outflowing gas than n@xmath2h@xmath5 . such molecular abundance contrasts are not unique to iras 4 and have been observed similarly elsewhere , e.g. , the single - dish observations of the l1157 core and outflow by bachiller & prez - gutirrez ( 1997 ) .",
    "another important reason our data distinctly trace specific motions is their high spatial resolution .",
    "for example , interferometers allow detection of the inverse p - cygni profiles because the brightnesses of the continuum objects in the relatively small beams can exceed the brightnesses of line emission from intervening , infalling gas along the line - of - sight , leading to red - shifted absorption .",
    "( blue - shifted emission in the inverse p - cygni profiles arises from concentrated gas on the far sides of the protostellar objects . ) in addition , the spatial filtering properties of the interferometer can further distinguish specific motions better than single - dish observations , especially at low relative velocities , by selectively sampling the kinematics of compact structures , and resolving out confusing , extended emission .",
    "for example , outflowing gas is detected more distinctly in interferometer observations of h@xmath2co or cs , beyond abundance differences , because zones of outflowing dense gas are expected to be more compact , and hence are more easily seen by an interferometer , than the outer , less - dense layers of a circumstellar envelope that may still contain abundant h@xmath2co or cs .",
    "on the other hand , interferometers can still detect non - outflowing gas in such an envelope using n@xmath2h@xmath5 because , unlike h@xmath2co or cs , it remains relatively abundant in the denser and more - compact inner regions that are less resolved out than outer regions .",
    "( as described below , n@xmath2h@xmath5 may be somewhat depleted relative to  canonical \" values in iras 4 . )",
    "detections of red - shifted absorption indicative of infall motions have been made primarily toward high - mass young stellar objects , where the absorption profiles were seen against the continuum emission of bright hii regions in interferometer beams .",

    "given that the south - by - southwest pocket is unusually red - shifted and that it lies in the same direction of the blue 4a outflow lobe ( see  4.2.2 ) , the pocket may be a local distortion of a rotational velocity field due to selective clearing of n@xmath2h@xmath5 at blue - shifted velocities by the outflow in that direction . a similar explanation may account for the unusually blue - shifted pockets in the same direction as the red outflow lobe . (",
    "the interpretation of velocity variations as caused by rotation is not unique , and the velocity distribution also could be due to bulk infall or outflow motions of gas on either side of 4a . )",
    "near 4b , the characteristics of @xmath46 are much different from those seen around 4a . the rms variation of @xmath46 is less than half the mean @xmath92 , i.e. , 0.096 km s@xmath1 vs. 0.25 km s@xmath1 , and only @xmath025% that of the non - outflowing dense gas around 4a , suggesting the variations of @xmath46 are not significant .",
    "in addition , no systematic variation of @xmath46 is seen with position , and hence no suggestion of rotation ( and infall or outflow ) , at least from the n@xmath2h@xmath5 10 line .",
    "the difference in rotational properties between the non - outflowing dense gas surrounding 4a and 4b is striking in the context of binary formation . since 4a is a known binary of 1  ( or 350 au ) separation but 4b has not been confirmed to be a multiple , the relatively large rotation of the non - outflowing dense gas about 4a suggests binaries may form preferentially in cores of relatively high intrinsic angular momentum but single stars form preferentially in cores of relatively low intrinsic angular momentum .",

    "ngc 1333 is located in the western perseus molecular cloud , a region where a large number of stars are forming in close proximity from gas that is fairly turbulent , judging from the observed line widths .",
    "for example , iras 4a and 4b have among the largest n@xmath2h@xmath5 10 line widths , 1.32 km s@xmath1 and 1.04 km s@xmath1 respectively , of the 47 class 0 or class i objects within 400 pc sampled by m97 . as the thermal fwhm of n@xmath2h@xmath5 is 0.247 km s@xmath1 if @xmath116 = 40 k ( i.e , .",

    "for example , maximum beam - averaged values of @xmath10 around both objects are @xmath60.84 km s@xmath1 , and the mean beam - averaged values of @xmath92 are both only @xmath00.50 km s@xmath1 , much less than seen in single - dish data .    at first glance ,",
    "it is conceivable that the larger @xmath10 in single - dish observations could originate from the unresolved combination of intrinsically narrow lines with potentially wide variations of central line velocity in the dense gas ( e.g. , from rotation ) .",
    "however , the rms values of @xmath46 and the mean values of @xmath10 are too small to support this possibility . instead , the overall reduction of line width with scale in iras 4 may be a manifestation of the linewidth - size relation , as observed in many molecular clouds ( e.g. , see mckee 1999 and references therein ) , and the interferometer data is probing the smallest scales of this relation . at these scales , the nonthermal component of the line width is predicted to be comparable in magnitude to the thermal component , possibly due to dissipation of turbulence ( vazquez - semadeni et al . 1999 ) or the cutoff of mhd wave propagation ( nakano 1998 ; myers 1998 ) at small scales .",
    "a similar but less dramatic reduction of line width with scale was noted for 8  quiescent cores \" in the serpens nw cluster region by williams & myers , which is presumed to be at a similar distance to ngc 1333 ( i.e. , 310 pc ; de lara , chavarria - k , & lopez - molina 1991 ) . in serpens nw , the mean width ratio for lines observed between 10  and 50  resolution over all 8 cores was 0.59 , whereas the mean width ratio for lines observed between @xmath04  and 27  over 4a and 4b is 0.43 , using the observations of m98 and the mean values of @xmath10 in table 5 .",
    "interestingly , the 8 cores found by williams & myers have typical sizes of @xmath05000 au , line widths of @xmath00.5 km s@xmath1 , and infall speeds of @xmath00.5 km s@xmath1 , values all similar to those of the non - outflowing dense gas around 4a and 4b ( assuming the infall speeds found in  4.2.1 from h@xmath2co apply to the n@xmath2h@xmath5 gas . )    despite the overall relative reduction in line width with scale seen here , the high spatial resolution of these observations reveals significant variations in @xmath10 in the non - outflowing dense gas around both objects ( see figures 7c and 7f ) , and a common narrow width of @xmath00.5 km s@xmath1 can not describe the line emission .",

    "lines of the first peak are located generally to the northwest and lines of the second peak are located generally to the southeast , although the populations are mixed . for 4b , the lines broaden systematically from north to south across its dense gas .",
    "the condensations from which 4a and 4b formed may be plausibly assumed to have had nearly - uniform initial velocity dispersions , as is seen in many starless dense cores ( see goodman et al . 1998 ; caselli et al .",
    "the star formation process from that time until the present likely increased the velocity dispersion by differing amounts thoughout each condensation , due mainly to modest outflow - core interaction or heating from the protostars , but very likely did not decrease the dispersion anywhere .",
    "every independent measurement of line width in the gas around each object then gives an upper limit on the initial velocity dispersion of the original condensation .",
    "the typical upper limit comes from the mean present - day line width ,",

    "@xmath00.2 km s@xmath1 in the gas around both 4a and 4b .",
    "these new limits indicate that the initial level of turbulence in star - forming condensations may be very low , even in regions of clustered star formation .",

    "if the velocity dispersion has evolved from its initial state though the injection of energy , line widths arguably should be largest at positions closest to possible sources of energy , and there is indeed some evidence for this in the dense gas around both objects .",
    "for example , there appears to be some spatial correspondence between large values of @xmath10 and the blue - shifted outflow features ( as traced by h@xmath2co ) south of both 4a and 4b .",
    "however , the situation is not so clear cut and evidence to the contrary is also found .",
    "for example , the narrowest lines in the non - outflowing dense gas around 4a and 4b are found actually near the respective red outflow features north of each object .",
    "moreover , large line widths are found across the southeastern half of the 4a dense gas , not just at positions near the blue outflow lobe .",
    "given the factor of @xmath01020 difference between the spectral width of the h@xmath2co wings and the width of the n@xmath2h@xmath5 line even at positions of large @xmath92 , whatever coupling does exist between the dense outflowing gas and n@xmath2h@xmath5 appears to be very inefficient .",
    "the weak coupling between the fast outflow and the non - outflowing gas may be a consequence of their difference in speed , with greater coupling expected when the flow speed is more comparable to the velocity dispersion of its environment .",
    "on the other hand , possibly the n@xmath2h@xmath5 is depleted more rapidly than it can be accelerated to speeds similar to the outflow .",
    "( the contrast of widths can not be ascribed to the outflow gas being less dense than the non - outflowing gas , as both transitions probe gas at @xmath11 @xmath8 10@xmath123 @xmath14 . )",

    "at the same wavelength . ) for 4b , the linear fit included the flux density at @xmath22 = 1.3 mm , although this measurement is particularly uncertain , and excluded our upper limit at @xmath22 = 1.3 cm .",
    "the similar slopes reveal that continuum emission for the iras 4 objects at @xmath22 @xmath6 1.3 cm is dominated by thermal emission from dust grains surrounding each source .",
    "given the deconvolved sizes of the emission , the warm dust being traced is likely situated within accretion disks or the inner radii of envelopes around each source .",

    "these values are similar to the @xmath129 @xmath8 1 values inferred for dust around many other young stellar objects , a decrease in @xmath129 possibly due to growth or composition changes of the dust ( beckwith & sargent 1991 )",
    ".    the submillimeter wavelength data of lay et al .",

    "departures of individual flux densities at millimeter wavelengths from the linear fits are seen least in the fit to the 4b sed , whose reduced @xmath131 = 1.6 , but are seen more for the fits to the 4a sed ( reduced @xmath131 = 7.9 ) and 4b  sed ( reduced @xmath131 = 9.5 ) .",
    "these latter large values of reduced @xmath131 may be due to underestimates of the absolute flux calibration uncertainties .    at specific wavelengths ,",
    "the largest departures from the linear fits are the positive ones found at @xmath22 = 3.2 mm for all 3 objects .",
    "the object 3c  84 was also observed during all tracks as iras 4 , but a similar positive departure of its flux density at @xmath22 = 3.2 from a linear fit is not seen .",
    "this consistency suggests the deviations in the iras 4 seds from their fits at this wavelength may be real , and the slopes of the iras 4 seds at @xmath22 @xmath130 3.2 mm may be shallower than those found in earlier fits .",
    "dust emission at @xmath22 @xmath24 3.2 mm may be declining at a steeper overall slope , possibly because the cooler , outer layers of the iras 4 envelopes are resolved out at our high resolutions , or have lower optical depths than the inner regions .    slightly shallower slopes of the linear fits are found for the 4a and 4b seds if our vla data are additionally excluded from the fits , i.e. , @xmath132 = -2.6 @xmath127 0.29 and -2.7 @xmath127 0.30 respectively , but these do not differ significantly from slopes obtained with the vla data included .",
    "one slope that does differ significantly is that of 4b , namely @xmath132 = -1.8 @xmath127 0.39 .",
    "the slopes of all three seds change only slightly if the nma data are also excluded .",
    "unlike for 4a and 4b , both @xmath126 and @xmath132 for 4b  are significantly more than the values of -3.8 or -3.9 derived by choi ( 2001 ) from interferometer continuum data at @xmath22 = 3.4 mm and @xmath22 = 2.7 mm .",
    "values of @xmath129 derived from our slopes suggest so 4b  could have dust with significantly different opacity than 4a and 4b , possibly from a population of larger dust grains . alternatively , the dust may be optically thick . given the relative dimness of 4b  relative to 4a or 4b , more sensitive data than those shown here ( especially at @xmath22 = 1.3 mm and @xmath22 = 6.9 mm ) are needed to properly evaluate either possibility .",
