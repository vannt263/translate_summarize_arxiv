    "the range of @xmath14 is from @xmath15 at the center to @xmath16 ; correspondingly , the range of @xmath17 is from @xmath18 at the center of configuration ( @xmath19 ) to @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath22 is also a measure of the strength of the field .",
    "we also make it such that the value of @xmath17 at @xmath15 is precisely @xmath22 ; this is no loss of generality as justified in appendix a.        for the case of four - dimensional field equations   to  , bronnikov  @xcite established some restrictive results , which have been latter generalized to @xmath28-dimensional field equations  @xcite .",
    "we are concerned with the following conclusions  @xcite .    *",
    "all horizons are simple . *",
    "all possible global structures for @xmath29 and for @xmath30 are the same ; * possible non - singular solutions have either minkowski / ads or de sitter structures .",
    "p - l asymptotically flat solutions with mass @xmath31 and @xmath32 having both signs are not excluded ; however , if @xmath33 no such p - l solutions ( @xmath31 ) exist .",
    "* for all functions @xmath34 , eqs   to   do not admit static , spherically symmetric regular bh and wormhole solutions with any asymptotic .",
    "* for @xmath33 , eqs   to   do not admit any hairy bh solutions ( no scalar hair theorems  @xcite ) .    an asymptotically flat bh solution to eqs   to is characterized by the presence of event horizons . since all horizons are simple , there is a change in the sign of @xmath35 at each event horizon .",
    "thus for a bh , @xmath35 has both signs in the domain @xmath36 . for an asymptotically flat p - l or ns solution",
    "there are no event horizons , thus @xmath35 has a constant sign for @xmath37 and because @xmath38 at spatial infinity so it is for @xmath37 . only for p - l solutions ,",
    "the functions @xmath35 , @xmath34 & @xmath39 are finite everywhere for @xmath37 .",
    "some static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solutions to eqs   to   have been derived in  @xcite , some of which represent different configurations of _ singular _ bhs . in ref  @xcite , bronnikov and shikin constructed bh , ns and p - l solutions .",
    "for the latter solution , their function @xmath40 ( eq ( b.3 ) of ref  @xcite ) does not approach 1 at spatial infinity ( @xmath41 ) ; rather , it approaches the limit @xmath42 , where @xmath22 is their parametric constant .",
    "thus , their ",
    "p - l \" solution is asymptotically flat only in the limit @xmath43 , corresponding to the trivial case @xmath44 with zero mass and constant functions @xmath45 : this is minkowski space time .",
    "recently , bronnikov and chernakova  @xcite constructed a two - parameter asymptotically flat bh characterized by its negative potential @xmath32 and where @xmath46 diverge near the center and converge as @xmath47 , while @xmath40 is finite everywhere .",
    "very recently , nikonov _ et al _  @xcite have obtained a two - parameter bhs and nss as well as a one - parameter p - l solutions . for the latter , all the three functions @xmath48",
    "are finite everywhere , @xmath32 has both signs and @xmath3 is an incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "most of the solutions constructed previously  @xcite were derived using the inverse problem method .",
    "the method consists in choosing a suitable function @xmath9 then solving eqs   to   for @xmath49 ( eq   is automatically satisfied ) .",
    "there are physically many interesting exact solutions to eqs   to   depending on the particular form of @xmath9 .",
    "the behavior of the solutions at spatial infinity is somehow defined by the boundary condition requiring that the solutions be asymptotically flat @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the schwarzschild mass . at the center",
    "there is no specific boundary condition , this is why there is a _ variety _ of possible asymptotically flat solutions , however , grouped into three categories : different ( singular ) bh solutions , ns and p - l solutions . to be more specific , the bh set ( @xmath40 having both signs ) include solutions where @xmath32 is finite everywhere ( this paper ) as well as solutions with divergent @xmath32  @xcite ; the same applies to the ns set where @xmath52 ( this paper ) .",
    "the solutions discussed in  @xcite and those discussed in this paper have different boundary conditions at the center .",

    ", we derive new integral formulas for @xmath49 and proof five corollaries and a theorem on selection criteria for obtaining predefined static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solutions to eqs   to",
    ". first we deal with the most generic case then focus on a constrained case with minimum conditions . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the behaviors of @xmath49 near the center and at spatial infinity are discussed , instances of solutions of particular interest are provided and two energy conditions are analyzed leading to two further corollaries . in section  [ sec4 ] , we derive further solutions by the inverse problem method .",
    "two appendices have been added for completeness .",
    "eq   is readily brought to the form @xmath55 ' = 2 $ ] which is integrated by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is constant of integration . integrating   leads to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a second constant of integration . with the boundary conditions",
    ", we must have @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "hence , @xmath62 using @xmath55 ' = 2 $ ] into  , we bring @xmath32 to the form @xmath63 substituting   into the one or the other expression of @xmath32 , one obtains @xmath64 finally , without loss of generality we take the negative sign in   ( @xmath65 ) and introduce two arbitrary constants @xmath66 & @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68    throughout the remaining part of the paper , when the limits of @xmath49 at the center @xmath22 exist , we define @xmath69 by @xmath70 @xmath71 & @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "this definition extends to their derivatives at the center .",
    "notice that eqs  , & have been derived without referring to any extra condition ( except the boundary conditions   and , in order to integrate  , we have assumed implicitly that @xmath73 exists ( @xmath9 differentiable ) ) , thus the following first two corollaries are generic .",
    "consider the case where @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath75 we have @xmath76 , thus the integral in   is positive leading to @xmath52 .",
    "hence ,    if the mass of the spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solution to eqs   to is such that @xmath74 where @xmath22 is the scaling constant , then the configuration is either a ns or a p - l solution . a negative - masse , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solution is either a ns or a p - l solution .",
    "now , let us look for the conditions that make ( the limit of ) @xmath40 finite at @xmath22 .",
    "writing @xmath77 in  , where @xmath78 is any fixed number in the open domain ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the improper integral @xmath80 converges by the limit comparison test .",
    "in fact , let @xmath81 & @xmath82 , since @xmath83 and since @xmath84 converges for @xmath85 , then the integral of @xmath86 is convergent . with that said ,",
    "the value of @xmath40 at @xmath22 is the following limit @xmath87 the conditions @xmath21 ( eq  ) and @xmath88 ( eq  ) imply @xmath89 for @xmath37 .",
    "now , with @xmath19 , the limit in   exists only is finite with @xmath90 arbitrary is @xmath91 .",
    "however , for this function @xmath92 & @xmath93 are divergent at @xmath22 , consequently @xmath32 too diverges at @xmath22 , thus there is no p - l solution . ]",
    "if @xmath94 . in this case @xmath95",
    "if @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the solution is a ns by corollary 1 . if @xmath98 , @xmath99 and the solution is a bh since @xmath35 has both signs . in this case",
    "( @xmath98 ) , @xmath35 is manifestly positive for @xmath100 .",
    "for @xmath101 , we can write the integral in   as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 . as @xmath17 decreases from @xmath105 to @xmath22 , the second integral @xmath106 decreases monotonically from @xmath107 to @xmath108 ( since we found @xmath99 ) . consequently , the sum of the two integrals and @xmath35 vanish at one and only one point @xmath109 ( event horizon ) between @xmath22 and @xmath105 : @xmath110 .",
    "thus for @xmath98 , @xmath109 is a simple root of @xmath111 ( all horizons are simple ) .",
    "if @xmath9 is differentiable at @xmath22 , a necessary condition to find a spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat p - l solution to eqs   to is @xmath112 and in this case @xmath113 . in the other cases ,",

    "the condition @xmath112 in the above statement for obtaining p - l solutions being necessary , one may derive solutions with @xmath112 which are not p - l solutions . by corollary 1 , these solutions must be nss .",
    "thus , corollary 2 does not rule out nss with @xmath112 .",
    "solutions with @xmath112 and @xmath115 divergent are indeed nss .",
    "we shall see in the next subsection that , for the conditions on which corollary 2 rests , @xmath35 is finite for @xmath116 . since the condition @xmath112 ensures finiteness of @xmath40 at @xmath22 , thus by corollary 2 we have solved the eigenvalue problem consisting in determining an everywhere finite solution @xmath35 to eq   with the  eigenvalue \" @xmath117 .    repeating the steps",

    "we will do that without losing much generality .",
    "thus , throughout the rest of this section , we assume that @xmath9 is four times differentiable in the domain @xmath36 , which means that there @xmath9 and the derivatives @xmath73 to @xmath122 are smooth functions ( continuous ) and finite @xmath123 notice that @xmath124 ; particularly , we have @xmath125 . in part 1 of appendix",
    "a , however , we will see that the third and fourth derivatives of @xmath9 need not exist on the whole domain @xmath126 ; rather , on a small half - open interval containing @xmath22 .",
    "the conditions   & do not ensure existence of taylor series expansions or others for @xmath9 at the center @xmath22 since the fifth and higher order derivatives of @xmath9 are not assumed to exist there and elsewhere .",

    "for this reason the method we are considering in this subsection ( as was the case in the previous one ) and appendix a is more general , different from and even advantageous than series expansion methods .",
