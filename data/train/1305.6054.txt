    "dark energy and any studies about dark universe are important in theoretical physics and cosmology . in order to understand nature of dark universe one can investigate time - dependent density of dark energy [ 1 ] .",
    "there are several models to describe dark energy [ 2 - 16 ] .",
    "we are interested to the cases of chaplygin gas ( cg ) as a model for dark energy [ 17 - 24 ] , which is extended to generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) for observational agreements [ 25 - 29 ] . also , it is possible to extend gcg to the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) [ 30 ] , or modified cosmic chaplygin gas ( mccg ) [ 31 ] .",
    "moreover , we know that the bulk viscosity plays an important role in cosmology [ 32 , 33 , 34 ] .",
    "the idea that chaplygin gas may has viscosity first proposed by the ref .",
    "[ 35 ] and then developed by the refs .",
    "[ 36 - 41 ] . in the refs .",
    "[ 31 , 36 ] we studied viscous modified cosmic chaplygin gas and viscous modified chaplygin gas , and calculated time - dependent energy density . in the ref . [ 38 ] we studied viscous chaplygin gas in non - flat frw universe . in these works we considered special case of @xmath0 , so extension of viscous generalized chaplygin gas for arbitrary @xmath1 performed in the ref .",
    "[ 39 ] . in all cases",
    "the viscous parameter considered as a constant . in the ref .",
    "[ 42 ] it is pointed that the viscous coefficient may be considered proportional to powers of density ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "so , in this work we study effect of non - constant bulk viscosity on generalized chaplygin gas .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas which unified dark energy and dark matter described by the following equation of state , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a positive constant and @xmath5 , so @xmath6 gives chaplygin gas equation of state .",
    "as we know the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe is described by the following metric , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 represents the scale factor .",
    "we assume that the universe is filled with the generalized chaplygin gas with equation of state ( 1 ) and neglect contribution of other components . also , @xmath10 is the total pressure which involves the proper pressure @xmath11 , given by equation of state ( 1 ) , bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath12 and hubble expansion parameter @xmath13 .",
    "also conservation equation is given by , @xmath14 now , one can obtain the following field equations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 where dot denotes derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath17 . by using the equation of state ( 1 ) and total pressure in the energy - momentum conservation formula ( 4 )",
    "one can obtain the following differential equation , @xmath18 main goal of this paper is considering @xmath19-dependent viscous coefficient instead of constant one . if we assume @xmath20 , then the energy density is obtained as the following , @xmath21^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is an integration constant .",
    "it is interesting to choose the bulk viscous coefficient as the following @xmath19-dependent expression , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant . in that case",
    "the equation ( 7 ) may be written as the following , @xmath25 our main goal is solving the equation ( 10 ) to obtain time - dependent density .",
    "then , we are able to discuss evolution of scale factor and hubble expansion parameter . + special case of @xmath26 yields to the following expression in terms of the hypergeometric function , @xmath27 in the fig . 1 we show behavior of energy density in terms of time for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this case corresponds to negative @xmath31 which may be unphysical , because we expect that increasing density , increased viscosity .",
    "but for the negative @xmath31 we find that increasing density decreased viscosity .",
    "therefore , we will consider another special cases with positive @xmath31 .",
    "with @xmath32 ( dotted line ) , @xmath0 ( solid line ) , @xmath33 ( dashed line ) . ]    in the fig .",
    "2 we draw behavior of energy density in terms of time for @xmath0 and some positive value of @xmath31 . we find that @xmath34 is essential condition to avoid singularity .     for @xmath35 ( dotted line ) , @xmath36 ( solid line ) , @xmath37 ( dashed line ) . ]    now , instead of equation of state ( 1 ) we used the following equation of state includes viscous coefficient , @xmath38 if @xmath39 and @xmath40 then , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a positive constant , which is equation of state of modified chaplygin gas .",
    "it means that viscous generalized chaplygin gas may serves as modified chaplygin gas .",
    "therefore we can write scale factor dependent energy density as the following , @xmath43^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is an integration constant and may be choose as the following , @xmath44 it is clear that large values of the scale factor ( @xmath45 ) give the following expression , @xmath46^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}},\\ ] ] which is corresponding to an empty universe .",
    "in this paper we considered generalized chaplygin gas which has viscosity .",
    "indeed we considered non - constant viscosity proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "special case of @xmath35 and @xmath0 yields to the results of the ref .",
    "[ 43 ] for @xmath48 ( flat space ) .",
    "two possibility of positive and negative @xmath31 investigated by using plots of fig . 1 and fig",
    "we found special case with @xmath40 and @xmath39 , changed equation of state of viscous generalized chaplygin gas to modified chaplygin gas .",
    "therefore , analogous to modified chaplygin gas we obtained energy density in terms of scale factor and saw that @xmath49 limit of the equation ( 14 ) reduced to the equation ( 8) .",
    "hence we expect that this model will be stable .",
    "however obtaining solution for arbitrary @xmath31 left for future study .",
    "also it is interesting to consider another dependents of viscosity such as @xmath50 .",
