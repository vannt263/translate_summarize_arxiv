    "a quantum computer , exploiting quantum state superposition and entanglement , is capable of performing select computations more powerfully than any classical computer@xcite .",
    "many quantum algorithms that achieve the same computational tasks much faster than their classical counterparts have been designed@xcite .",
    "these theoretical results have led many groups to try to realize a quantum computer experimentally . up to now",
    ", there are a rapidly growing number of proposed device technologies for quantum computation@xcite . of these technologies , those exploiting nuclear magnetic resonance(nmr )",
    "have been the first to demonstrate non - trivial quantum algorithms with small numbers of qubits@xcite , most authors realized three - qubit nmr quantum computation@xcite .",
    "one of the key challenges we are facing is to increase the size of the system used .",
    "it is notable that the largest number of qubits used up to date is seven - qubit@xcite . to experimenter",
    ", any computational task could be viewed as a quantum circuit composed of quantum logic gates@xcite , in analogy to the situation of classical computers .",
    "in addition , from the point of view of decoherence , the circuit must be high efficient in experiment .",
    "therefore , it is important to demonstrate the multi - qubit quantum logic gates on a large number of qubits effectively in practice . on the other hand ,",
    "some methods to construct the arbitrary multi - qubit quantum circuit with a sequence of universal two - qubit gates were reported recently@xcite .    in this paper , we start from the introduction of @xmath1 gate , and try to realize it with a sequence of two - qubit @xmath2 gates presented by barenco et al@xcite . through this procedure",
    "we find that in nmr doing nothing ( suspending evolution ) in one part of a system while doing something in another part of the system is nontrivial , i.e. the extension of two - qubit gate to more than two coupled spins is complicated and not easy to implement",
    ". then , we report the implementation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 gates by utilizing the electromagnetic pulses of well - defined frequency and length in three and four - qubit systems . for the sake of experimental convenience , these pulses are physically reasonable choice for the method of quantum circuit construction in quantum computation rather than two - qubit @xmath5 gate .",
    "it seems that this method is experimentally convenient when we extend this procedure to more qubits , and one can perform a large class of multi - qubit controlled rotations simultaneously in many physical systems such as quantum dots , nuclear spins and trapped ions _",
    "the @xmath6 gate is a @xmath7-qubit quantum logic gate in which there are @xmath8 control qubits and one target qubit , performing the unitary transformation    @xmath9    @xmath10    for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes the and of the boolean variables @xmath13 it can be seen that @xmath8 control qubits does not change their values @xmath14 after the action of the @xmath1 gate and the target qubit flips its state @xmath15 to @xmath16 if and only if @xmath17 . the @xmath6 gate can also be described by the following unitary matrix    @xmath18    where the basis states of @xmath19 qubits are lexicographically ordered , i.e. , @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the @xmath23 identity matrix and @xmath24 are pauli spin matrices .",
    "when @xmath25 , @xmath5 is the so - called cnot gate    @xmath26    it has a role to play in quantum measurement , in creation and manipulation of entanglement and in quantum error correction .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 gate is of central importance in quantum computation because any quantum logic gates can be decomposed into a sequence of one - qubit rotations and two - qubit @xmath5 gates@xcite .",
    "most implementation of the @xmath5 gate in a liquid state nmr involved a special sequence of resonance electromagnetic pulses .",
    "for example , in two - spin physical system of the carbon-13 labeled chloroform , the `` modified '' @xmath5 gate was implemented using two radio - frequency pulses@xcite .",
    "the first pulse induced a @xmath28/@xmath29 rotation of the target spin around the one axis of the rotating reference frame .",
    "the second pulse induced a similar rotation around the other axis .",
    "the delay time between two pulses was @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the interaction constant .",
    "this action is modified in the sense that it differs from @xmath5 gate in relative phases but it require even less resources .",
    "one can also see the ideal implementation of @xmath2 gate with more resources@xcite .",
    "if @xmath32 , @xmath3 can be regarded as a three - qubit quantum logic gate which is named as toffolli - gate now , and this gate plays the role of a universal gate for reversible circuits .",
    "@xmath33    similarly , the four - qubit gate @xmath34 can be written as    @xmath35    one method to implement @xmath3 gate and @xmath36 gate would be to make use of one - qubit rotations and two - qubit @xmath5 gates .",
    "several schemes have been proposed to realize @xmath6 gates by these foundational quantum logic gates . however , extending the number of qubits has not been proved easy .",
    "barenco et al .",
    "exhibited to obtain the best known three - qubit toffoli gate@xcite@xmath37 with five @xmath5 gates ; in this same paper , they also built up a @xmath34 gate with thirteen @xmath5 gates@xcite .",
    "_ proved that any @xmath8-qubit quantum circuit , expressed as an unitary operator , could be constructed using a finite number @xmath38 of two - qubit gates@xcite .",
    "more important , due to the interactions among the qubits , to apply two - qubit gate while doing nothing on the other @xmath39 qubits in @xmath8-qubit system is much more complicated than to apply the same two - qubit gate in a two - qubit nmr quantum computer@xcite .    the above scheme to realize the @xmath6 gates @xmath40 depends heavily on using the fundamental two - qubit @xmath27 gate .",
    "although each gate in these schemes can be implemented by appropriately refocused evolutions in nmr , however , the approach to realize @xmath6 gate in the n - qubit nmr system according to these theoretical schemes is not efficient in general .",
    "there are two main reasons .",
    "one is that most of these schemes are to construct the arbitrary quantum circuit with a sequence of the two - qubit operation @xmath5 .",
    "this may not be a physically reasonable choice in some nmr quantum computation , but for the moment this should be considered as a mathematical convenience which will permit us to address somewhat general questions .",
    "the other is that nmr quantum operations depend heavily on the molecule being used .",
    "the fact that the chemical shift and coupling constant are small in the spin systems leads to the requirement of the highly frequency selectivity which is important in quantum operation .",
    "seth lloyd described a method to perform arbitrary quantum circuit by a sequence of electromagnetic pulses of well - defined frequency and length in a weakly - coupled quantum systems@xcite .",
    "for the purpose of interpreting this method , let us consider a macroscopic ensemble of @xmath8-spin molecules at room temperature .",
    "the @xmath8 nuclear spins in each molecule represent a @xmath8-qubit register .",
    "the qubits are labeled by the characteristic frequencies , @xmath41 , @xmath42 due to the zeeman interaction of the nuclear spins with the magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the nuclear spins in a molecule in solution is well approximated for the following reason : small interactions with other nuclei do not play a major role in the dynamics while higher order terms in the spin - spin coupling can be disregarded in the first - order model , and the rapid molecular tumbling averages away in the liquid at a high magnetic field .",

    "some groups tested this method experimentally in their small two - qubit and three - qubit nmr quantum computers@xcite . here , we extend this method to four - qubit systems and realized the toffoli gate and @xmath4 gate experimentally .",
    "the single - pulse experimental realization of a modified three - qubit quantum @xmath83 gate ( toffoli gate ) is shown in figure 1 . in our nmr approach to realize three - qubit @xmath3 gate we need three qubits .",
    "a convenient system we used is the liquid consisting of identical chlorostyrene molecules , the three weakly coupled spin 1/2 hydrogen nuclei , which are distinguished by their different resonance frequencies , i.e. @xmath84 , @xmath85and @xmath86 , can be regarded as the isolated qubits ( @xmath87 ) .    in this experiment ,",
    "the difference frequencies of the three spins are @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath31 coupling constant between the two qubits are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the transmitter frequency of the transition - pulse is set at the @xmath94 .",
    "the power and the duration of the transition - pulse are adjusted to optimize the frequency selectivity .",
    "the real part of the fourier transform of the resulting signal gives a nmr spectrum of the target qubit-3 containing four peaks at frequencies @xmath95 .",
    "these four peaks ( from left to right ) correspond to the two control qubits in the following states @xmath96and @xmath97 .",
    "it is clear that our implementation of the quantum @xmath98 gate leaves the computer in a final result as expected : if any one of the two control qubits is in ground state , the target qubit-3 does not change its value after the action of the gate ; and if the two control qubits are both in states @xmath82 , the target qubit-3 flips its state @xmath99 .",
    "the experimental realization of a modified four - qubit quantum @xmath36 gate is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the physical system that we used to implement the @xmath34 gate is the liquid - state proton and carbon nmr of @xmath100 labeled alanine @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 , with decoupling of the methyl protons , alanine exhibits a weakly coupled four - spin system .",
    "the @xmath105 was chosen as target qubit ( labeled qubit-4 ) because of its well - resolved couplings with the other carbons @xmath106 and with the adjacent proton @xmath107 , which were chosen as the three control spins ( labeled qubit-1 , qubit-2 and qubit-3 ) .",
    "the selective @xmath28 pulse were applied on the connected single - quantum transition @xmath108 @xmath109 of the target qubit-4 , it is noted that all eight lines arise from the target qubit-4 , and the intensity of each line is proportional to the total population difference between the corresponding states .",
    "it is clear that our implementation of the quantum logic gate leaves the computer in a final result as expected ,    all nmr experiments are performed at room temperature and pressure on bruker avance @xmath110 spectrometer @xmath111 with a @xmath112 probe in laboratory of structure biology , university of science and technology of china .",
    "we can see the small but significant distortions in the final spectra arising from the difficulty of implementing perfect selective pulses and inhomogeneity of the magnetic field .",
    "the experimental task is to shape the radio - frequency pulse envelope so as to achieve sufficient selectivity in the frequency domain that there is negligible perturbation of the next nearest neighbor of the spin multiplet .",
    "in conclusion , utilizing the proper resonant pulse of the well - defined frequency and length , we have demonstrated the reversible and universal three and four - qubit quantum @xmath6 logic gates in two - level nuclear spin systems at room temperature .",
    "one of the key challenges in quantum computation is to try to increase the size of the system used .",
    "the transition pulse that used in this paper can apply to all qubits of a quantum register in one operation .",
    "the operational time of the pulse is not influenced by the number of the qubits , therefore , it is experimentally convenient when we extend this procedure to more qubits .",
    "this advantage may be helpful to answer the question given a unitary transformation corresponding to a quantum computational task , what is the shortest sequence of pulses and evolutions which generates it ?",
    "further , in quantum information processing , this single - pulse quantum operation is useful not only in an ensemble of nuclear spins system but also in many other physical systems such as quantum dots , trapped ions _ etc . _",
    "although the multi - qubit gates implementation with transition pulse is much simpler , it must be noted that it takes more time than the multi - qubit gates implementation with spin - selective pulse . for the experimenters , a reasonable choice should be to combine the utility of various nmr methods .",
