    "<S> in a recent publication [ m.  b. stone , new journal of physics * 9 * 31 ( 2007 ) ] a `` renormalized classical 2d '' ( rc ) phase has been reported in a quasi - two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet phcc . </S>",
    "<S> its key signature is a sharp cusp - like feature in the magnetic susceptibility which appears below the critical field of magnetic ordering indicated by specific heat anomaly and emergence of a bragg peak . </S>",
    "<S> here we present experimental data which shows that regardless of experimental geometry , the specific heat and susceptibility anomalies in phcc both coincide with the onset of true long range order . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves no room for any additional intermediate `` rc '' phase .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the central claims of this work is the existence of a novel `` renormalized classical 2d '' ( rc ) phase in the quantum magnet phcc . </S>",
    "<S> this phase supposedly separates the long range order ( lro ) phase from the quantum paramagnetic ( qp ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> its key signature is a sharp cusp - like feature in the magnetic susceptibility . according to stone _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , at @xmath0 it appears _ below _ the critical field of magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the latter manifests itself in a lambda - anomaly of @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and the appearance of a magnetic bragg reflections . </S>",
    "<S> the rc phase is then said to exist in the field range between the two _ distinct _ anomalies in susceptibility and specific heat .     orientation . </S>",
    "<S> arrows indicate the susceptibility kinks signifying phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> b ) @xmath3 phase boundaries in phcc based on calorimetric and magnetometric data from different sources . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1],width=453 ]    in a recent study @xcite we have demonstrated that any rc - like phase is absent for a magnetic field applied along the @xmath4 crystallographic axis . it was later argued @xcite that the discrepancy is only apparent , since the rc phase was initially reported for the @xmath5 geometry , and may be absent in other orientations . to clarify this issue we repeated our measurements in the @xmath5 geometry of the original study . </S>",
    "<S> measurements were done on a 69  mg solution - grown @xcite single crystal of phcc . </S>",
    "<S> ac susceptibility data were collected at 316  hz using a commercial quantum design ppms system . </S>",
    "<S> the measured @xmath6 curves are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a for different temperatures . as in all previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> including those represented in fig .  2 of stone et al . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite and fig .  2 of @xcite , we see a clear cusp - like feature in the measured field sweeps ( arrows ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data at each temperature were analyzed as in @xcite to pinpoint the exact position of the anomaly . in fig.[fig1]b </S>",
    "<S> we show the measured temperature dependence ( solid diamonds ) . for comparison , we also show the critical field of 3d ordering determined from @xmath1 measurements , as digitized from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 11 of stone _ et al _ ( asterisks ) . within experimental error , </S>",
    "<S> the two phase boundaries coincide , excluding the possibility of any intermediate phase . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the locations of the sharp anomalies in @xmath7 and @xmath6 observed by stone _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> are shown in crosses ( digitized from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 11 ) , and are clearly inconsistent with our measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> the actual field orientation does not seem to play any role , despite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[fig1]b we show the temperature dependencies of calorimetric and @xmath7 anomalies previously measured in phcc for different field orientations . for these data , </S>",
    "<S> the values of magnetic field were re - normalized by the slightly anisotropic @xmath8-factor of cu@xmath9 in phcc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an excellent data collapse is apparent .    a further discrepancy with stone _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> is in the shape of the measured @xmath7 curves at elevated temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath5 @xmath6 data measured at @xmath10  k ( fig.[fig1]a ) are considerably broader than the corresponding curves in fig .  2 of stone _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._. a similar discrepancy is found between our 3  k data and those reported by stone _ et al . _ in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath7 curves from stone _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ closely resemble our data collected at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> one can speculate that the discrepancy may amount to a trivial thermometry problem . to ensure that this does not apply to our new measurements </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed experiments in a different ppms unit using a vibrating sample magnetometer equipped with separate temperature sensor . </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility curves obtained by differentiating the thus - measured magnetization data are virtually identical to those that we get from ac experiments .    in summary , regardless of experimental geometry , the specific heat and susceptibility anomalies in phcc both coincide with the onset of true long range order . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves no room for any additional intermediate `` rc '' phase . </S>"
