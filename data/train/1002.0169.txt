    "the ( isolated ) rssler oscillator presents a stable limit cycle . for our simulations , we have chosen as initial condition for each oscillator in the network a randomly perturbed version of a particular point of this stable limit cycle .",
    "this particular point is @xmath201 .",
    "we have chosen the perturbed initial state for the @xmath27-th oscillator to be @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is a uniformly distributed random variable in the @xmath204-dimensional cube @xmath205 ^{3}$ ] , and @xmath206 is independent of @xmath207 for @xmath208.i    in our first simulation , we use a coupling strength @xmath209 ; thus , we predict the synchronous state to be locally stable .",

    "in this paper , we have studied the eigenvalue distribution of the laplacian matrix of a large - scale small - world networks .",
    "we have focused our attention on the low - order moments of the spectral distribution .",
    "we have derived explicit expressions of these moments as functions of the parameters in the small - world model .",

    "we have studied the local stability of the synchronous state in a large - scale small - world network of oscillators .",
    "our approach is based on performing a triangular reconstruction matching the first three moments of the unknown spectral measure .",
    "our numerical results match our predictions with high accuracy .",
    "several questions remain open .",
