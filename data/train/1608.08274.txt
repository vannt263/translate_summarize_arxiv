    "an interaction model between a real scalar field and a two - level atom called unruh - dewitt ( udw ) particle detector was conceived  @xcite , improved  @xcite and studied in many physical situations  @xcite .",
    "a udw detector consists of a two - level atom linearly coupled to a scalar field .",
    "research in this area typically focuses on a single udw detector to probe the field or two udw detectors to study bipartite correlations with a special interest in the vacuum entanglement .",
    "the calculation is of a perturbative character but to the author s knowledge , the unruh - dewitt hamiltonian has not been ( dis)proved to be exactly solvable  @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is the next best thing .",
    "we also approach the problem perturbatively and provide an expansion to an arbitrary order of a coupling constant and so we can study the field - detector(s ) interaction in the strong coupling regime . crucially , unlike a typical situation in quantum field theory , we show that the number of perturbative terms grows polynomially with the perturbative order .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast with the textbook problem of the interacting scalar @xmath1 theory ( and other more realistic models ) where the number of terms grows factorially  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the perturbative series are typically asymptotic and this limits even the perturbative approach itself . as",
    "one reaches the perturbative order of approximately the inverse of the coupling strength the series summands start to increase .",
    "the series diverges  @xcite and resummation techniques must be used  @xcite . in the case of two udw detectors",
    "we show that there is no factorial explosion and the polynomial growth indicates no problems with convergence .",
    "could it be then that the actual series for two udw detectors we obtained here is summable or is the issue of divergence more subtle and persistent ?",
    "this is an interesting open question probably waiting to be rigorously settled but the results presented in this paper will prove to be useful irrespective of the answer .",
    "surprisingly , a part of our udw calculation turns out to be useful for a perturbative calculation of the scattering amplitudes in the interacting scalar @xmath1 theory . a typical approach for the high - order loop corrections is to enumerate all participating feynman diagrams  @xcite . here",
    "we circumvent this step and instead use the statistics cousin of wick s theorem  @xcite known as isserlis theorem  @xcite to directly calculate the perturbative contributions .",
    "this is possible due to an easy way of finding all ( non - negative ) solutions of a system of linear diophantine equations isserlis theorem leads to . as a result , the scattering amplitudes for the interacting @xmath1 scalar model can be found without the need to infer feynman s rules  @xcite .",
    "feynman s diagrams can , however , be easily recovered and we demonstrate the whole process on the textbook examples of the second order expansion of the @xmath3 and  @xmath0 models ( for two interacting fields ) .",
    "this obviously does not remove or circumvent the fast growth of the perturbative contributions in these models but it seems that the approach coming from this direction is novel and makes the perturbative calculations ( even to high orders ) extremely streamlined",
    ". this may be surprising due to the fact that diophantine equations have a well - earned reputation of being hard to solve .    in section  [ sec",
    ": udw ] we recall the definition of the unruh - dewitt detector , take two copies of it and introduce the problem we would like to solve .",
    "the solution is presented in section  [ sec : phases ] and is divided in three phases . in section  [ sec : phin ] we show how to apply our approach to perturbatively calculate the scattering amplitudes for the @xmath1 scalar model .",
    "a realistic udw detector is described by the following term @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a real scalar field where @xmath6 is a four - momentum , @xmath7 is a detector s window function ( @xmath8 is its proper time and @xmath9 are minkowski coordinates ) , @xmath10 a smearing function , @xmath11 are the detector ladder operators , @xmath12 stands for the energy gap and @xmath13 for a coupling constant .",

    "out task is to efficiently calculate the following unitary @xmath18 for any @xmath19 , no matter how large , and for any input atomic state .",
    "we denoted @xmath20 and so @xmath21 holds .",
    "note that we set @xmath10 to be a delta function for convenience .",
    "the result of this paper is oblivious to the details of smearing , window functions or trajectories .",
    "the important expression is eq .",
    "( [ eq : twoudwdetectors ] ) and the fact that @xmath22 are bosonic in nature .",
    "our final goal is to express @xmath23-point correlators in terms of a polynomial number of 2-point correlators and not their calculation where these details are relevant .",
    "the matrix elements of  ( [ eq : twoudwdetectors ] ) ( in the canonical basis ) will be shorthanded as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and a tensor product implied .",
    "so for the detector density matrix we get @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes minkowski vacuum and @xmath28 is the detectors initial state .",

    "we will derive @xmath29 for @xmath30 and show a trivial modification enabling us to calculate eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitaryentries ] ) for any canonical basis state @xmath28 .",
    "this , on the other hand , will lead to a ` standalone ' unitary matrix @xmath31 that can be used to find @xmath29 for _ any _ detector input state and thus completely solving the problem . in the first step ( phase  i ) we tame the exponential number ( in @xmath19 ) of summands of the core expression  eq .",

    "there are two possibilities for the output states : @xmath39 and @xmath41 but taking into account the nilpotency property of @xmath11 we can also enumerate all possible ways the output states can be obtained .",
    "it is simply @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "all other operator sequences result in zero . in our case",
    "we have two sets of ladder operators  for the @xmath14 and @xmath17 hilbert spaces and so    [ eq : allpaths2atoms ] @xmath44    in the first two lines @xmath19 is even and in the last two lines @xmath19 is odd .",
    "the sums should be understood as counting all possible strings of the sigma operators leading to a given output state on the left and we will now find the explicit expressions . let s call them _",
    "nonzero strings_. given the desired output state , the main observation is that there are always only two sigma operators that do not destroy the previous nonzero string .",
    "this is because every nonzero string acting on @xmath45 can land in only one of the four possible states .",
    "for instance , if the state is @xmath46 the next sigma operator can be @xmath47 or @xmath48 to get another nonzero string .",
    "similarly for the other three states and so we can represent all nonzero strings as a complete binary tree of the depth @xmath19 where we adopt the following convention : the root node is the initial state @xmath45 where the left offsprings correspond to the action of @xmath49 and the right offsprings correspond to @xmath50 .",

    "[ fig : littlebintree ] . in all the branchings that follow the left offsprings",

    "given the offspring node , the choice of either @xmath53 or @xmath54 in the branching is unambiguous .    but this immediately provides the desired counting because we have just proved a bijection between the number of branches of a perfect binary tree of the depth @xmath19 and the number of non - zero strings of the same length . consider  eq .",

    "it also illustrates the fact that the same analysis can be done for any initial state @xmath28 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 the arrows in the binary tree will represent different ladder operators leading to the same counting and different boson operators on the rhs of eqs .",

    "we can obtain an output state for @xmath73 .",
    "a non - trivial check is the trace of  ( [ eq : omega ] ) being equal to one irrespective of the perturbative order .",

    "however , upon inserting two such expressions into eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) we note that the exponential growth crept back .",

    "the theorem is also known as wick s theorem  @xcite .",
    "wick s theorem transforms time - ordered operator expression into a normal form  @xcite and isserlis result is recovered upon taking a ( free ) vacuum expectation value . as a matter of fact , isserlis theorem is more general since naturally there is no notion of time - ordering in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isserlis ] ) and so the theorem applies even for ` ordinary ' products of free scalar fields .",
    "of course , we are actually calculating the time ordered version as it appears in the definition of the sought after green s function .",

    "7 ) we also find a perfect agreement . from this point",
    "we proceed as usual .",
    "since we integrate over the ` internal ' variables ( here labelled 3 and 4 ) , some conformations represent the same physical process .",
    "we can easily find them from ( [ eq : ell1133 ] ) as those invariant wrt the swap @xmath226 .",
    "those are the following pairs of ten - tuples : @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 . considering the double multiplicities we reproduce and finalize the derivation of the second order of the @xmath3 theory  @xcite(ch .",
    "7 ) .    of course , these are standard results obtainable through wick s theorem . yet",
    ", the ease with which we reproduced them is notable as we do nt need to count the contractions or draw the feynman diagrams .",
    "an implementation of theorems  [ thm : phaseii ] and  [ thm : phaseiii ] in a suitable programming language such as mathematica is straightforward . for example , one can convert the proof of theorem  [ thm : phaseii ] into a program that systematically finds all solutions . essentially , if it takes one time step to find the first solution then all @xmath230 solutions can be find in @xmath230 time steps where @xmath230 increases polynomially .",
    "there is really no diophantine calculation involved since due to the simple form of  ( [ eq : diophantine ] ) we get _ all _ the solutions by inspection and only need to list them ( save them to a memory )",
    ".    the whole process would arguably be much more impressive for more than two interacting fields and for high - loop corrections . in that case",
    "the number of variables increases and theorem  [ thm : phaseii ] needs to be generalized .",
    "this can be done in a straightforward way but the presence of more variables is ultimately responsible for the factorial growth of the perturbative contributions .",
    "we obviously can not get rid of the factorial growth but the easy - to - see character of the diophantine linear system remains and so all the solutions can again be listed in @xmath230 time steps ( @xmath230 grows factorially with a perturbative order , though ) . in this way , we can again get the perturbative contributions for any number of interacting fields , to a essentially an arbitrarily high perturbative order ( keeping in mind the exponential growth discussed in this paragraph ) and for all @xmath19 with no effort whatsoever .",
    "furthermore , the feynman diagrams are encoded in the conformation exponents .",
    "this is not surprising as @xmath231 represents a free propagator @xmath232 for @xmath233 being the internal degrees of freedom .",

    "hence we can immediately obtain the standard way of performing the perturbative expansion of the @xmath0 model ( for two interacting fields and to the second order ) .",
    "the same is true for any @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we present two results : the main one is an efficient perturbative calculation of the interaction hamiltonian for a pair of unruh - dewitt detectors in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the result is independent on the detector details and works for any smearing , envelope function or trajectory by efficiently decomposing a generic @xmath23-point correlator to a product of two - point green s functions where the detector details play a role .",
    "an efficient calculation means that the number of perturbative terms increases polynomially with the perturbative order of the coupling constant .",
    "this is atypical in quantum field theory as even in the simplest models ( such as the interacting scalar @xmath1 model ) the number of perturbative terms explodes factorially .",
    "a notable accompanying result is an extremely straightforward calculation of the perturbative expansion for the previously mentioned interacting scalar @xmath1 model without going through the construction of feynman diagrams ( they can be immediately recovered from our approach ) .",
    "the presented method seems novel and even though the usual route through the creation of feynman diagrams can be computerized the proposed technique here mechanized the whole perturbative calculation to the point of no effort .",
    "we demonstrate it on the typical case of @xmath2 for the @xmath1 model , for two interacting fields and up to the second order .",
    "a generalization for many interacting fields and a high perturbative order ( again for any @xmath19 ) seems straightforward .",
    "this does not say that we can avoid the factorial growth of perturbative contributions  we can just streamline it as much as possible .",
    "the details of this process can be an interesting direction to pursue .",
    "going back to the main result , it also offers several routes for further explorations .",
    "one is the study of more than two unruh - dewitt detectors and showing the same tractability as presented here for two detectors .",
    "it seems that for a fixed number of unruh - dewitt detectors the growth remains polynomial .",
