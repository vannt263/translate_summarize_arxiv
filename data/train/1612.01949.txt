    "the study of the electronic dynamics in molecules is a subject of great current experimental interest@xcite and has been intensively investigated also from a quantum chemical perspective.@xcite most of these theoretical works concern the many - electron dynamics in isolated molecular systems neglecting the effects that may be induced by the presence of a dynamically reactive ( i.e. polarizable ) environment , as a solvent .",
    "in fact , when the molecule is in solution ( or in even more complex environment ) , the electronic dynamics is coupled to the behavior of the solvent , that is in general delayed resulting in a far - from trivial dynamics of the overall solute+solvent system . within the polarizable continuum model ( pcm)@xcite for solvation the general theoretical framework to investigate such dynamics",
    "was set long ago,@xcite but only in a recent paper,@xcite we have shown a convenient way to take into account such coupled dynamics _ in real time_. this approach was based on the definition of _ equations of motion _",
    "( eom)@xcite for the time - dependent apparent charges that in pcm generate the time - dependent reaction field.@xcite alternative approaches to study real - time solute electron dynamics within the pcm have also been devised and applied.@xcite    in our previous work , the evolution of the electrons of the molecule was described by a real - time time - dependent density functional theory ( rt - tddft ) approach . while the set - up exploited there was suitable to show how apparent charge eom derived for the debye dielectric constant@xcite could be seamlessly added to the bare rt - tddft propagation , it is not ideal to study qualitatively the effect of the solvent on the solute dynamics involving excited states .",
    "in fact , it is well - documented that the present versions of rt - tddft suffer from various artifacts when excited and/or non - stationary states are in focus : for example , the response to @xmath0-pulses ( i.e. , light pulses that take all the molecular population from ground state to a given excited state ) is unphysical , @xcite and rabi oscillations are not properly described.@xcite all these artifacts are thought to be consequences of the adiabatic approximation , i.e. , the assumption that the exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential at a given time depends only on the density at that time rather than to all the previous instants.@xcite although in perspective the use of rt - tddft promises to achieve the prominent role that dft and linear response tddft have for investigating ground state propertie and excitation energies and spectra , at present studying electronic dynamics under generic electromagnetic perturbations with rt - tddft is complicated by such artifacts .",
    "an alternative to rt - tddft is the use of time - dependent methods based on the polyelectronic time - dependent schrdinger equation . in practice , for molecules in vacuo this boils down to precalculate a sufficiently large number of excited states energies and dipole elements , and then to numerically evolve the expansion coefficients of the polyelectronic wavefunction on the eigenstate basis under the time - dependent electromagnetic perturbation .",
    "various groups used this approach in the past for investigating electromagnetic field effects on molecules in vacuo .",
    "krause , klamroth and saalfrank@xcite extended the configuration interaction singles ( doubles ) , cis(d ) , to the time - dependent domain ( td - cis(d))to directly study the laser - pulse - driven many - electron dynamics , focusing in particular on @xmath0 pulses and consequent dipole - switching .",
    "klamroth@xcite exploited td - cis coupled to the optimal control theory to find the laser pulse shaped that maximizes the population transfer to a selected excited state , and krause and klamroth@xcite investigated the role of the molecular size in the selectivity of such pulses .",
    "schlegel , smith and li@xcite compared the behavior of td hartree fock ( td - hf ) , td - cis and td - cis(d ) to describe the dynamics of molecules in intense electromagnetic fields .",
    "they found similar behaviors between td - hf and td - cis for low applied electromagnetic fields , while they found differences when the perturbative regime ( i.e. , excited state populations much smaller than 1 ) is left .",
    "the comparison has been recently extended to eom - ccsd as well.@xcite other wave - function approaches have been based on time - dependent self - consistent field methods , @xcite that however are less straightforward in terms of qualitative behaviors due to the non - linearity associated with the self - consistency.@xcite    in the present work , we couple an approach based on a time - dependent polyelectronic wave function with a pcm description of the time - dependent solvent response in the eom formalism .",
    "thanks to this development , the evolution of the molecular wavefunction in solution under an external perturbation can be studied free from qualitative artifacts . in this work ,",
    "we have chosen to rely on the simplest of the wave - function based approaches for excited states , i.e. , cis . despite its well - known quantitative limitations ( in particular its tendency to overestimate excitation energies)@xcite it is the simplest method that encompasses the formal features common to more complex approaches , as well as a correct qualitative behavior for solvent - affected excitations such as charge - transfer ones .",
    "td - cis has been used before to investigate the time - dependent behavior of molecules subjected to electromagnetic radiation.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section _ theory _ , the basic concepts of the eom pcm approach , on one side , and td - cis for molecules in vacuo are recalled and the way such approaches can be coupled is described in details . in section _ results and discussion _ , we shall show results for the solvent relaxation following a transition to a given excited state both within the onsager solvation model and the pcm approach .",
    "in particular , we shall create this excited state in two different ways .",
    "first we shall simply assume an instantaneous excitation from the ground to the excited state , in the usual fashion of non - equilibrium approaches .",
    "this is the standard way the excitations are modeled in the frequency domain calculations of optical properties of molecules in solution.@xcite then we shall create the same state by applying a @xmath0 pulse to the molecule , of short but finite length .",
    "this is a more physical realization of the excitation , that is possible only when a real - time description of the system is at hand .",
    "finally we shall draw the conclusions .",
