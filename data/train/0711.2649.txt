    "the neutrino oscillation phenomenon is well established now @xcite . for the detailed information about neutrino flavour oscillations we refer to the pioneer works @xcite ,",
    "some resent reviews @xcite and references therein . from the theory of this phenomenon it follows that oscillations are possible only when neutrino possesses non - vanishing mass .",
    "consequently , a neutrino has non - trivial electromagnetic properties . in particular",
    ", a dirac neutrino has to possess a non - zero magnetic moment @xcite . in turn , the existence of the magnetic moment is associated with so - called neutrino spin oscillations .",
    "these oscillations are described as neutrino spin precession or , in other words , as transitions between left - handed ( active ) and right - handed ( sterile ) neutrino states in an electromagnetic field .",
    "phenomenology of this effect was widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however in the most popular papers the theory of neutrino spin oscillation was based on solving the cauchy problem for the schrdinger type equation with an effective hamiltonian .",
    "so the states of neutrino were treated as mixed states .",
    "the purpose of our work is to find a complete system of solutions of the wave equation which accounts for the influence of an electromagnetic field and a dense matter on neutrino dynamics .",
    "the existence of such system gives a possibility to describe the states of neutrino with rotating spin as pure states and to evaluate the probabilities of various processes with neutrino in the framework of the furry picture .",
    "when the interaction of a massive neutrino possessing an anomalous magnetic moment @xmath0 with background fermions is considered to be coherent , its propagation in matter and electromagnetic field is described by the dirac ",
    "pauli equation with the effective potential @xcite . for a moving and polarized matter such an interaction",
    "is described by the effective four - potential @xmath1 .",
    "the function @xmath2 is a linear combination of the currents @xmath3 and the polarizations @xmath4 of background fermions . in these equations @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are , respectively , the number density and the mean value of the polarization vector of the background fermions @xmath7 in their center - of - mass system . in this reference",
    "frame the mean momentum of the fermions @xmath7 is equal to zero , and @xmath8 denote the four - velocity of the reference frame .",
    "summation is carried out over the background fermions @xmath7 .",
    "we use the units @xmath9 .",
    "the expressions for the coefficients @xmath10 depend on the model chosen for neutrino interactions . in the framework of the standard model these coefficients calculated in the first order of the perturbation theory have the forms @xcite    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is an electric charge of the fermion , @xmath13 is a third component of weak isospin , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the fermi constant and the weinberg angle respectively . for electron neutrino interaction with electrons , positrons , otherwise @xmath16 .",
    "let us discuss an equation for neutrino ( its mass eigenstate ) in matter and electromagnetic field .",
    "in order to avoid correlations between flavour and spin oscillations ( the mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein effect @xcite ) we shall suppose that the effective four - potential is the same for all neutrino flavours and consider the matter , in which a fraction of electrons is small , i.e. approximately @xmath17 .",
    "in what follows , we restrict our consideration to the case of a homogeneous medium .",
    "then the explicit form of the generalized dirac ",
    "pauli equation is uniquely determined by the assumptions similar to those adopted in @xcite : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is an electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath20 .",
    "the quantities with hats denote scalar products of the dirac matrices with four - vectors : @xmath21    note , when propagation of neutrino through a dense matter and an electromagnetic field is studied , we should keep in mind that the matter and the field are mainly situated in the same area .",
    "therefore strengthes of electric and magnetic fields and average velocities and polarizations of matter should satisfy the self - consistent system of equations including the maxwell equations , the lorentz equation @xmath22 and the classical spin evolution bargmann ",
    "michel  telegdi ( bmt ) equation @xcite @xmath23\\lambda^\\nu_{f}.\\ ] ] here a dot denotes the differentiation with respect to the proper time @xmath24 .",
    "as already mentioned , we restrict our consideration to constant velocity and polarization of matter and constant homogeneous electromagnetic field in equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "however , even such a choice imposes certain limitations on @xmath19 and @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , function @xmath1 is a linear combination of currents and polarizations of background fermions . since the velocities ,",
    "polarizations and number densities of different components of matter are independent characteristics in the general case , then from the condition @xmath26 or @xmath27 it follows that velocities and polarizations of background components should be stationary : @xmath28 using equations ( [ 01 ] ) , ( [ 02 ] ) we can obtain the restriction @xmath29 it should be stressed that this condition is a direct consequence of the fact that the average velocity and polarization of particles of matter in an external field should satisfy the classical equations of motion .",
    "let us look for a solution of equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "since the functions @xmath30 , @xmath25 are constant , the canonical momentum operator @xmath31 commutes with the hamiltonian of this equation .",
    "however , the commonly adopted choice of eigenvalues of this operator as quantum numbers is not satisfactory in our case .",
    "particle kinetic momentum components related to its group four - velocity @xmath32 by the relation @xmath33 are more suitable to play this role . in the present paper we discuss the solutions described by the quantum numbers which can be interpreted as kinetic momentum components .",
    "the explicit form of a kinetic momentum operator for a particle with spin is not known beforehand , hence , in order to find the appropriate solutions , we have to use the correspondence principle .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if effects of neutrino weak interactions are taken into account , the lorentz invariant generalization of the bmt equation for a spin vector @xmath34 of a neutrino moving with the four - velocity @xmath32 has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 here and further for the simplification of the formulae we include a value of neutrino magnetic moment into an electromagnetic field tensor , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "we introduce quasi - classical spin wavefunctions , which can be constructed as discussed in @xcite .",
    "suppose the lorentz equation is solved , and the dependence of particle coordinates on the proper time is found .",
    "then the bmt equation transforms to an ordinary differential equation , whose resolvent determines a one - parametric subgroup of the lorentz group .",
    "the quasi - classical spin wavefunction is represented by a spin - tensor , whose evolution is determined by the same one - parametric subgroup . in our case",
    "this spin - tensor represents the dirac bispinor .    following the technique presented in the works @xcite we choose the solution of equation ( [ 1 ] ) in the form    @xmath38    in this formula",
    "@xmath39 is an operator of evolution for a quasi - classical spin wavefunction , @xmath40 is a phase factor , and    @xmath41    is a solution of the dirac equation for a free particle . here",

    "@xmath39 obeys the equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a dual electromagnetic field tensor .",

    "clearly , our arguments based on the consideration of vector and axial currents and the final formula ( [ g14 ] ) are illustrations for neutrino propagation through background media . as it is commonly known @xcite , in a relativistic case",
    "only the integrals of motion are well defined observables .",
