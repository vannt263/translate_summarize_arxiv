    "in transition - metal spinels , magnetic , charge , and orbital interactions are strongly affected by the crystal geometry .",
    "a special character of spinels is associated with the arrangement of cations in the octahedrally coordinated sites forming a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "consisting of the corner - sharing tetrahedra , this crystal structure causes the geometrical frustration of magnetic interactions and makes the electronic ground state highly degenerate @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the system may remain in a disordered state like a quantum spin liquid or spin ice even at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "it makes also the electronic state very susceptible to lattice distortion , which lifts the degeneracy and drives the structural phase transition .",

    "the b sites create the atomic chains along the @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] directions . in the most common cases ,",
    "the valence state for the a site is 2 + and for the b site 3 + ( @xmath15 in mgal@xmath2o@xmath1 ) .",
    "the 4 + valence state for the a site exists only in the high - pressure forms of olivines ( fe@xmath2sio@xmath1 , co@xmath2sio@xmath1 ) . in inverse spinels , the a atoms occupy half of the octahedral sites , while the b ones are shared equally by the octahedral and tetrahedral sites .",
    "fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is classified as the inverse spinel due to mixed valency of iron ions in the octahedral sites ( 2+/3 + ) .",
    "depending on the type of cations in the octahedral sites , transition - metal spinels exhibit various types of ordered phases at low temperatures @xcite .",

    "verwey proposed that a discontinuous drop of the electrical conductivity at @xmath18 k is associated with the ordering of the fe@xmath19 and fe@xmath20 ions in the octahedral sites @xcite . according to this scenario , the conductivity increases above @xmath21 due to higher mobility of electrons fluctuating between the fe sites . at @xmath21 ,",
    "electron movement freezes out and the charge ordering stabilized by the electrostatic forces develops .",
    "however , this simple picture was not confirmed by more recent studies .",
    "firstly , anderson demonstrated that in the spinel geometry the energy difference between a short - range and long - range order is very small and therefore typical order - disorder mechanism is therefore unlikely @xcite .",
    "secondly , the crystallographic studies revealed the monoclinic deformation below @xmath21 , which is inconsistent with the verwey model @xcite .",
    "the diffraction measurements support only the fractional charge ordering with small differences of charges @xcite .",
    "finally , the theoretical studies demonstrated the importance of local coulomb interactions in the @xmath5 states on iron , which induces the charge - orbital ordering in the monoclinic phase @xcite . in our studies , we developed the mechanism of the verwey transition based on the interplay between the electron correlations and the electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",

    "fe@xmath2sio@xmath1 , which is the end - member of geologically import group of olivines ( mg , fe)@xmath2sio@xmath1 , can be obtained from magnetite by replacing the fe atom at the a site by the si atom .",
    "the experimental information on the electronic properties of this mineral is very limited .",
    "the heat capacity measurement revealed the peak at @xmath22 k , most probably associated with the paramagnetic - antiferromagnetic transition @xcite . above @xmath23 , a paramagnetic state is consistent with the mssbauer measurements @xcite . in the previous study , we have analyzed the electronic structure of fe@xmath2sio@xmath1 using the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "we found that the insulating state results from the local hubbard interaction @xmath3 included within the generalized gradient approximation within the so - called gga+@xmath3 approach .",

    "it is reasonable to assume that the coulomb interaction parameters @xmath31 are the same in both fe@xmath0o@xmath1 and fe@xmath2sio@xmath1 systems in their insulating phases , as one expects that the screening of the coulomb interaction should be rather similar .",
    "however , we can not exclude that the coulomb parameter @xmath3 changes in the magnetite at the verwey transition , when the metallic state is transformed into an insulating one ( this effect was not considered in the theory until now ) .",
    "the calculations for the cubic symmetry @xmath11 were performed in the @xmath32 supercell and for the monoclinic phase @xmath33 of magnetite in the @xmath34 cell , both with 56 atoms .",

    "the splitting of the @xmath5 states into the @xmath7 and @xmath42 orbitals is induced by the crystal field , which is much larger at the octahedral sites than at the tetrahedral ones .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] , we compare the electronic density of states ( dos ) in these compounds for @xmath45 .",

    "these states come only from the fe atoms at the octahedral sites .",
    "neither the @xmath5 states on the fe(a ) atoms in magnetite nor the @xmath46 and @xmath47 states participate in the electron transport .",
    "similarly to the fe(b ) states , the up - spin and down - spin states at the fe(a ) sites are splitted by the exchange coupling .",
    "all the down - spin states are occupied , while the up - spin states are empty , so the magnetic moments on the a and b sites have the opposite directions generating the ferrimagnetic order in magnetite",
    ". the half - metallic ground state of magnetite agrees with the properties of the high - symmetry phase indicating that the local coulomb interactions do not play important role at high temperatures .    without the hubbard interaction , the metallic ground state of fe@xmath2sio@xmath1",
    "has the ferromagnetic ( fm ) order with the magnetic moment on iron equal @xmath48 .",
    "it remains a metal even at high pressures , showing a disagreement with the insulating behavior of this material .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the main effect of pressure is to increase the bandwidth due to larger overlap of the @xmath5 orbitals .",

    "we compare the changes in the doss induced by the on - site interactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , while keeping the cubic symmetry .",
    "we allow only for the relaxation of the lattice constant and the internal parameter @xmath49 .",

    "3(b ) , the interaction @xmath3 has a strong impact on the electronic dos , inducing the insulating gap at @xmath43 .",
    "the gap with the magnitude @xmath52 ev separates the occupied down - spin @xmath7 states from the empty ones .",
    "the insulating state is generated by the inter - orbital hubbard interaction with the effective energy @xmath53 ( note that @xmath3 is here an average value of local coulomb interaction for different electron pairs , as usually assumed in the local density approximation supplemented by local electron - electron interactions ( lda+@xmath3 ) @xcite ) , so the magnitute of the gap can be estimated from the formula @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the width of the @xmath7 band . for @xmath56",

    "the verwey transition involves both the charge and orbital degrees of freedom , and their ordering below @xmath21 is stabilized by the monoclinic distortion @xcite . using the group theory , we found that the low - symmetry phase results from the condensation of two phonons ( order parameters ) with the symmetries @xmath58 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the strength of the electron - phonon coupling strongly depends on the hubbard interaction @xmath3 , which induces the antiferro - orbital ordering and splitting of the @xmath7 states at the fermi level . without the lattice distortion ,",
    "the electronic state with orbital polarization is highly degenerate showing a short - range order @xcite .",
    "we found that the charge - orbital ordering is stabilized by the coupling between the @xmath5 electrons and the @xmath8 phonon @xcite .",

    "the displacements of the b@xmath0 and b@xmath1 atoms together with oxygens located in the same plane induce the orbital ordering on the b@xmath59 and b@xmath2 atoms in the nearest neighbor planes .",
    "the second order parameter @xmath58 also couples strongly to electrons but it does not induce the gap opening .",
    "it generates the crystal distortion which doubles the unit cell in the @xmath61 direction .",
    "these results demonstrate that the cubic phase is not a real ground state of magnetite , and the structural transition to a phase with broken symmetry must occur when temperature is lowered .",

    "we have considered two magnetic configurations with the fm and af order .",
    "we assumed that the magnetic moments in the af configuration are aligned parallely in the ( 001 ) planes , and have opposite ( alterneting ) directions in the subsequent planes along the @xmath61 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) . instead of the @xmath61 axis",
    "one can choose either @xmath64 or @xmath65 direction , so the af order is triply degenerate in the cubic symmetry .",
    "we found that for @xmath9 ev , there is a change of the ground state from the fm to af order @xcite .",
    "this change is driven by the metal - insulator transition at the same value of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the electronic dos with the fm order presented in fig .",
    "3(b ) does not correspond to the ground state realized at @xmath27 ev .",
    "we revealed that the af configuration induces the tetragonal distortion ( @xmath66 ) , breaking the cubic symmetry and lowering the total energy .",

    "the gap separates the occupied states at the b@xmath59 and b@xmath1 sites from the empty ones at the b@xmath2 and b@xmath0 sites .",
    "this explains the origin of the fractional charge ordering in the monoclinic phase .",
    "the orbital ordering arises due to the preferential occupation of the @xmath7 states . a schematic plot of the orbital ordering is presented in fig .",

    "the presented results reveal some interesting aspects of two iron - based spinels . as a common feature ,",
    "the electronic properties of both compounds are strongly affected by the on - site hubbard interaction @xmath3 .",
    "the interplay of this local coulomb interaction with a lattice distortion is the driving force of the observed phase transitions , which lead in both spinels to a new ordered phase with a broken cubic symmetry .    in magnetite",
    ", this interaction does not lead directly to the insulating phase as in the mott - hubbard mechanism .",
    "it enhances a natural tendency of the degenerated @xmath7 states to create an orbital ordering .",
    "such state becomes very sensitive to lattice distortion , which by splitting the @xmath7 band opens the insulating gap .",
    "this mechanism is similar to the jahn - teller effect , however , the lattice distortion in magnetite is much more complex than in simple perovskites , see e.g. ref .",
    "the structural transition is here induced by two order parameters , which couple to each other and generate the monoclinic phase @xcite .",
    "long time ago , anderson predicted the existence of the short - range order in magnetite on the basis of the simple electrostatic model @xcite .",
    "there are many signs of such state above the verwey transition .",
    "one of them is the insulating gap that does not close completely at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "recently , the resonant x - ray scattering studies revealed that charge - orbital ordering starts to develop about 10 k above @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the charge - orbital fluctuations couple to phonons producing the critical diffuse scattering .",
    "the neutron studies found the symmetries of lattice distortions associated with these fluctuations .",
    "they are the precursors of the order parameters @xmath58 @xcite and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we found that the geologically important mineral fe@xmath2sio@xmath1-spinel is a mott insulator .",
    "the on - site hubbard interaction @xmath3 in the @xmath5 states on iron generates the insulating state with the af order .",
    "we suggest that these af interactions drive the phase transition observed at @xmath22 k. furthermore , we discovered that the af order induces the tetragonal distortion reducing the cubic @xmath11 symmetry to its subgroup @xmath16 .",
    "this distortion releases the geometrical frustration of the magnetic interaction enabling for the long - range order . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have estimated the exchange constant @xmath4 and the curie - weiss temperature @xmath74 using the classical heisenberg model . the obtained large values of the exchange constant @xmath75 mev and the curie - weiss temperature @xmath76 k",
    "are in sharp constrast with the low value of @xmath22 k and indicate that magnetic interactions are strongly frustrated and are expected to generate short - range order above @xmath23 .",
    "so far , there are no experimental indications that the af order in its simplest form ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) exists below @xmath23 , and its nature is more subtle .",
    "one possibility is that the magnetic order is non - colinear , with complicated spin orientations .",
    "in such a case , the low - symmetry structure could be different from the tetragonal .",
    "it is also possible that below @xmath23 the magnetic order has only a short - range character ( similar to spin ice ) , or the long - range order coexists with the short - range order like in the znfe@xmath2o@xmath1 spinel @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we suggest that while the origin of the verwey transition in fe@xmath0o@xmath1 could be understood , the nature of the magnetic order in fe@xmath2sio@xmath1 below @xmath23 poses an interesting experimental problem .",
