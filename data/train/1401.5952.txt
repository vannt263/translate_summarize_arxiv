    "short laser pulses are widely used in microscopy , spectroscopy and micro - machining.@xcite they allow the study of elementary processes in real time and , thanks to their high peak power , they are ideal for investigating nonlinear phenomena .",
    "however they are difficult to handle , since as they propagate through any medium , including air , they collect phase distortions .",
    "this is particularly critical in the case of focusing through high numerical aperture objectives , since the amount of glass contained in such devices is enough to broaden the pulse duration of a femtosecond pulse by several orders of magnitude.@xcite there are several techniques which can in principle be used to compensate phase distortions and deliver transform limited pulses to the sample plane of a microscope .",
    "the most straightforward are based on prism and grating compressors , which can be used to minimize the quadratic and cubic terms in the phase expansion.@xcite    pulse shaping has , in principle , the ability to compensate arbitrary phase distortions,@xcite but how to determine which phase to program in the pulse shaper is less straightforward .",
    "genetic algorithms , for instance , require substantial measurement time and computational effort and do not always yield the desired pulse phase profile in a reproducible way .",
    "frequency - resolved optical gating ( frog ) is perhaps one of the most popular tools to retrieve to phase of femotosecond pulses,@xcite and there are several others ingenious techniques.@xcite a significant step towards reliable and reproducible compression of ultra - short laser pulses was achieved by the group of dantus , with the development of miips.@xcite the authors demonstrated the possibility to compensate the phase distortion introduced by a @xmath0 objective by only using miips.@xcite however the compensation of higher na objectives benefits from external compression ( for instance by a prism pair ) to retain the accessible phase range of the shaper.@xcite    in this paper we show that miips can be improved by complementing it with an amplitude gate , that is scanned across the spectrum .",
    "we demonstrate that this gated version of miips ( fig.[fig : gatedmiips ] ) estimates more accurately the spectral phase , without the need to increase the measurement time .",
    "it is also less affected by systematic errors originating from higher order phase distorsions and shaper artifacts .",
    "the work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : miipsintro ] we give a brief introduction to the miips technique ; in section [ sec : miipschallenges ] we discuss the limitations of the standard implementation of miips ; in section [ sec : gatedmiips ] we introduce gated - miips , in section [ sec : analytical ] we derive analytical models for miips and gated - miips ; in section [ sec : numsimulation ] we illustrate , by numerical simulation , the advantages of gated - miips and , in section [ sec : expdata ] , we show experimental data indicating that gated - miips is better suitable than standard miips in estimating the phase of a femtosecond laser pulse .",

    "miips was designed as a tool to control multi - photon processes and to characterize and compress ultrashort laser pulses.@xcite it employs a pulse - shaper setup , in order to estimate the group delay dispersion ( gdd ) and to compensate arbitrary complex spectral phase distortions .",
    "the main concept is that the gdd is correlated with the intensity of second harmonic generation ( shg ) : at any given frequency the shg is maximized if the gdd is null.@xcite it follows that a transform limited ( flat phase ) pulse can be obtained by applying suitable phase masks and maximizing the shg for the whole spectrum.@xcite this can be seen from the equation for the shg at the frequency @xmath1 in the ideal case ( assuming @xmath2 ) as : @xmath3      { \\rm d}\\omega \\left.\\vphantom{\\int } \\right|^2\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the amplitude of the electric field at angular frequency @xmath1 . a list of the symbols used in this articles can be found in table [ tab : listofabbreviations ] .",
    "since the first two factors of the integrand in eq.[eq : shg ] are positive , the shg is maximized when the argument of the exponential is zero .",
    "expanding the phase in series and retaining the second order , the approximated equation for the shg becomes : @xmath5 it follows that the shg is maximized when the group delay dispersion @xmath6 is equal to zero .",
    "this condition is at the basis of miips , and it is valid as long as the phase can be locally approximated by a second order polynomial .",
    "the standard implementation of miips involves adding a sinusoidal modulation to the phase of the laser pulse , typically using a pulse - shaper : @xmath7 \\right\\ } \\label{eq : miipstestphase}\\ ] ] we note that such a sinusoidal phase modulation can also be seen , in the time domain , as the generation of a pulse train.@xcite the modulation frequency @xmath8 , which has the units of time , corresponds to the temporal separation between subsequent pulses.@xcite the gdd is then estimated by varying the modulation phase @xmath9 ( fig.[fig : gatedmiips ] ) and determining for which values the shg intensity is locally maximized .",
    "combining eq.[eq : shg ] and eq.[eq : miipstestphase ] and using the prosthaphaeresis formulae , it is possible to show that the shg of a laser pulse subject to sinusoidal phase modulation is maximized when : @xmath10 = 0 \\label{eq : miipscondition}\\ ] ] which means that the gdd can be estimated , to the second order of accuracy , as : @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the value of the scanning parameter @xmath9 which maximizes the shg for the frequency @xmath1 . the phase is then recovered numerically by double integration . for a more extensive description of the implementation of miips and its applications we refer to the works by dantus , quoted in the references .",
    "we note that the zero and first order terms in the taylor expansion of the phase do not contribute to second harmonic generation ( eq.[eq : shg ] ) and therefore are not measured by miips.@xcite the zero order is responsible for the carrier - envelope phase and the first order leads to a translation of the pulse along the time axes .",
    "a known limitation of miips is that it only considers the @xmath13 order correction to the phase at a given frequency , neglecting higher orders in the taylor expansion.@xcite although this can lead to tolerable errors for not overly distorted pulses , in other cases it can significantly reduce the accuracy of miips as discussed below .",
    "xu et al . showed that the systematic error is of the order of @xmath14 , where @xmath8 is the miips modulation frequency and @xmath15 is the transform limited pulse duration.@xcite from the above estimate , it might seem that accurate results could always be obtained for very short pulse duration , just by choosing a very small modulation frequency , and indeed an ideal miips simulation , which does not take into account any of the shaper artifacts , would confirm this conclusion .     laser pulse after propagation through @xmath16 glass , using different phase modulation frequencies and keeping the maximum correction constant @xmath17 .",
    "( a ) shg uncorrected and miips corrected spectra for different phase modulation frequencies .",
    "( b ) residual phase for the uncorrected laser pulse ( demagnified @xmath18 times ) and after miips correction using different phase modulation frequencies.,width=317 ]    in fig.[fig : miipsperformance ] we report several simulated miips scans performed on a @xmath19 laser pulse centered at @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , after propagation through @xmath16 of bk7 glass , which mimic the optical path length of a microscope objective . for each scan",
    "we report the residual spectral phase and the shg spectrum . in order to compare the different modulation parameters we kept the maximum gdd correction constant ( see eq.[eq : maxgdd ] ) .",
    "as expected , the best performance in terms of maximum shg and residual phase are obtained for the smaller values of the modulation frequency @xmath8 .    in practice",
    "the adjustment of the modulation parameters is subtler because , for highly distorted ultrashort pulses , it requires setting the modulation amplitude to very high values , which in turn deteriorates the spectrum by introducing shaper artifacts , like for instance diffraction caused by phase grating and ripples in transmitted spectra .",
    "the former can be minimized by employing a double pass 4f pulse shaper setup.@xcite the latter can be explained as follows .    by definition",
    "the spectral phase is given by multiples of @xmath22 radians .",
    "however due to cross - talk between the slm pixels , phase and amplitude distortions can be observed in the spectral regions where the phase crosses @xmath22 , known as wrapping.@xcite therefore , if the amount of wrapping is very high , the spectrum transmitted through the slm can be too distorted to be accurately characterized .",
    "this poses a limitation to the total phase which can be compensated and it is particularly severe for very short pulses ( @xmath23 ) in combination with high - numerical aperture objectives .",
    "[ fig : miipstrajectory ]     for the above reasons , a common choice is to set the phase modulation frequency @xmath8 equal to the transform limited pulse duration @xmath15.@xcite this is a good compromise because lower modulation frequency would result in having a too high modulation amplitude , which would cause phase - wrapping artifacts , as we previously discussed .",
    "higher modulation frequencies , on the other hand , are not optimal because the second order polynomial expansion in eq.[eq : shgapprox ] loses validity . indeed , since miips uses a sinusoidal phase mask , it introduces both second ( sod ) and fourth order ( fod ) corrections , linked by the relation : @xmath24 . in a 2d map which represents the shg intensity as a function of gdd and fod values ( fig.[fig : miipstrajectory ] ) , miips maximizes the signal along a linear trajectory and from fig.[fig : miipstrajectory ]",
    "it can be seen that this maximum does not necessarily correspond to a zero gdd .      for a defined set of modulation parameters , the maximum gdd which can be compensated by a single miips iteration",
    "is : @xmath25 on the other hand , the minimum gdd which can be compensated depends on the size of the phase steps and on the maximum relative error which can be accepted for the gdd .",
    "if @xmath26 is the increment of the argument of the sinusoidal modulation , and @xmath27 is the maximum relative error on the gdd , then it follows that : @xmath28    the dynamical range , defined as the ratio of the maximum and the minimum gdd is therefore : @xmath29 which leads , for a scan of 1000 points and an accuracy of @xmath30 , to a dynamical range of only 16 .",
    "this explains why miips needs to be iterated multiple times to compensate the phase of laser pulses .",
    "this limitation can be mitigated by limiting the spectral bandwidth ( and the range of gdd values ) around the frequency at which the gdd is being compensated , as done in gated - miips discussed below .",
    "we developed gated - miips to avoid the limitations of miips when compensating large phase distortions caused by broad spectra and high numerical aperture objective .",
    "the idea , illustrated in fig.[fig : gatedmiips ] , is to enable using higher modulation frequencies for the sinusoidal phase , while avoiding systematic errors due to higher order phase terms . in the next sections ,",
    "however , we will show that gated - miips is more accurate that miips also with the same choice of modulation parameters .",
    "gated - miips can be readily implemented using a pulse shaper which provides both phase and amplitude modulation .",
    "the amplitude modulation is exploited to gate the spectrum around a specific frequency ( fig.[fig : gatedmiips]c ) , therefore improving the validity of the second order polynomial expansion of the phase , even in the case of significant higher order contributions , as will be shown below .",
    "it then becomes possible to use higher values of the modulation frequency @xmath8 and lower values of the modulation amplitude @xmath31 minimizing the phase wrapping . in the case of a gaussian gate",
    "the modulation that is applied by the pulse shaper can be written as a function of the phase terms : @xmath32 ^ 2   + i \\phi_0 \\sin \\left[\\tau \\ , ( \\omega-\\omega_0)-\\psi \\right ]   \\right\\ } \\end{split } \\label{eq : gate}\\ ] ]    as it can be seen from eq.[eq : gate ] , in gated - miips a gaussian amplitude mask of width @xmath33 ( here called gate ) is translated alongside the phase modulation , using the scanning parameter @xmath9 . to improve the accuracy for the gdd values closer to the gate boundaries ( @xmath34 ) the gated - miips signal @xmath35",
    "is then obtained by dividing the shg spectrum by the square of the gaussian amplitude mask .",
    "@xmath36 ^ 2 \\right\\ }      \\label{eq : gatedmiipssignal}\\ ] ]    by combining eq.[eq : shg ] with eq.[eq : gate ] , in analogy with what previously discussed for the standard miips case , it can be shown that :    @xmath37 \\left.\\right ] \\left.\\right\\ } { \\rm d}\\omega \\vphantom{\\int}\\right|^2 \\end{split } \\label{eq : gatedmiips}\\ ] ]    by direct inspection , it can be seen from eq.[eq : gatedmiips ] that the gated - miips signal @xmath35 is maximized by the same condition expressed by the eq.[eq : miipscondition ] .",
    "therefore , in the ideal case gated - miips should provide the same results as the standard miips .",
    "the advantage of gated - miips stems from the fact that the presence of the gaussian term in eq.[eq : gatedmiips ] improves the validity of the second order expansion of the spectral phase ( eq.[eq : shgapprox ] ) .    in analogy with standard miips,@xcite the gated - miips signal",
    "can also be expressed analytically for a few simple pulse shapes .",
    "for instance , analytical expressions for the shg signal of a transform limited gaussian pulse , subject to sinusoidal phase modulation , have been given by hacker et al.@xcite and reproposed by lozovoy et al.@xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , an analytical expression of the miips signal in the case of a chirped gaussian pulse has not been shown yet . in the next section",
    "we will derive it for the cases of both miips and gated - miips .",
    "such an expression can be useful for fitting a miips trace without relying on a peak finding algorithm , as it is usually done.@xcite additionally , we will show that an approximated analytic expression for gated - miips signal can be also be written for a generic pulse shape , provided that the field amplitude varies slowly with respect to the gaussian gate ( eq.[eq : gate ] ) .",

    "the resulting shg is given by : @xmath43 eq.[eq : miipsfullanalytical ] can be accurately computed using a limited number of terms , because as @xmath44 increases the contribution of each added term decreases exponentially .",
    "a simpler formula , accurate to second order in the phase , can be obtained by doing the taylor expansion of the phase term in eq.[eq : miipsgaussianpulse ] .    after some algebraic manipulation one obtains : @xmath45 ^ 2 \\right\\}^{-1/2 } \\end{split }",

    "the analytical expression for the gated - miips signal is very similar to the one we just derived for miips . by substituting eq.[eq : chirpedpulse ] into eq.[eq : gatedmiips ] , after some algebraic manipulation , one arrives at a formula similar to eq.[eq : miipsgaussianpulse ] , except for the substitution @xmath47 inside the integration sign .",

    "reported in fig.[fig : glasscompression10 cm ] it can be seen that the gated version of miips is superior in both estimating the group velocity dispersion and yielding greater shg after one iteration .",
    "the difference could be even greater if we consider that , to compensate such a considerable gdd , we had to employ a modulation amplitude @xmath31 of @xmath60 , which could cause significant phase - wrapping distortions . in order to reduce phase wrapping , we would have to decrease @xmath31 and correspondingly increase @xmath8 ( see eq.[eq : maxgdd ] ) .",
