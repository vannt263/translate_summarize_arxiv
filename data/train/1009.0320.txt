    "the discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with frequencies around 1 khz from several low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite has been increasing the interest in the detailed theory of disk accretion onto neutron stars .",
    "several authors have suggested that at least some of the khz qpos may be related to the kepler frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the accretion disk around a neutron star ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "_ @xcite have suggested that the frequency of the co  rotating orbit at isco in compact stellar remnant could be determined through x ",
    "ray observations of low  mass x  ray binaries and",

    "morsink and stella have remarked the central rle of isco in relativistic precession of orbits around neutron stars and bulik _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that observations are consistent with the assumption that the maximum ",
    "frequency qpos occurs at the isco .",
    "the last statement could be used to test general relativity ( gr ) in the strong  field regime around accreting neutron stars , or even to measure the stellar mass by directly comparing the highest frequency manifest in the x  ray flux with the relativistic formula for the orbital frequency in the isco orbit @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the study of the structure and dynamics of neutron stars endowed with magnetic field in gr is an active , interesting and challenging theoretical issue .",

    "_ @xcite have indicated how magnetic field affects the maximum mass of stars . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ellipticity of the deformed star due to the rotation and to the magnetic field is calculated , and these two effects are compared to each other within gr .",
    "in addition , the formulation of deformation of relativistic stars due to the magnetic stress , considering the magnetic fields as perturbations from spherical stars , has also been studied in @xcite by means of an analytical treatment assuming weak magnetic fields compared to gravity .",
    "the quadrupole deformation of magnetized newtonian stars was discussed by chandrasekhar and fermi @xcite and ferraro @xcite .",

    "more than one decade ago , shibata and sasaki ( hereafter s&s ) computed an approximate analytical formula for the radius at isco on massive rotating and arbitrarily deformed sources within gr .",
    "they considered the rle of the quadrupole moment of mass in physics related to neutron stars ( this fact has also been noted by other authors , see for instance and references therein ) , by including multipolar moments of mass up to the @xmath2pole order in their calculations . yet , as discussed above , there exist an strong influence of the magnetic field on the structure of the neutron stars and hence is desirable to include also the magnetic field in an approximation as the given by s&s . in the present paper",
    "we tackle this point by following the procedure by s&s to compute approximate formulas for the isco including the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "thereby , our goal is to calculate approximate formulas for the radius , angular velocity , energy and angular momentum at isco for massive rotating and deformed sources endowed with magnetic dipole . due to the importance that these parameters have for magnetized neutron stars ( see _ e.g. _",

    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ formalism ] the general formalism to calculate the isco for a neutral particle orbiting around a massive source in gr is presented . the procedure to compute the approximate formulas for radius , angular velocity , energy and angular momentum at isco of a neutral test particle is shown in section [ approx ] .",

    "as can be easily noted from the insets in fig.[fig : mu1 ] , for the case of a dipolar magnetic moment of @xmath98 , the changes introduced in the radius at isco by the approximate formula ( [ risco ] ) taking into account the magnetic dipole are negligible .

    "in this paper , we have obtained simple approximate formulas for the radius , the angular velocity , the energy and the angular momentum of a neutral test particle at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "these formulas correct the results obtained by shibata and sasaki and generalize it to the case of neutral test particles moving on the equatorial plane around a rotating source endowed with magnetic dipole . in order to test the accuracy of our approximate expressions ,",
