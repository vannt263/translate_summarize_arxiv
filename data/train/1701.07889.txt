    "the idea of intrinsic shape of a nucleus turned out instrumental for understanding many features of the nuclear structure and spectroscopy .",
    "in particular , specific nuclear shapes were related to the prominent shell effects in both proton and neutron systems exhibited by the nuclear binding , and to the observed patterns of collective excitations . besides the axial quadrupole distortion which is the nuclear deformation of primary importance , the secondary effects of hexadecapole @xcite and , in some regions , octupole @xcite distortion are clearly recognized . additionally , there are theoretical predictions of quadrupole triaxial equilibrium shapes in some nuclei , e.g. @xcite , but rather limited experimental evidence for them , see e.g. @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "even more exotic shapes are possible , characterized by a high rank symmetry group which would lead to an extra degeneracy of s.p .",
    "energy levels .",
    "one such possibility is the tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "it is well known that many quantum objects , like molecules , fullerenes and alkali metal clusters prefer such a shape in their ground state . due to these facts a hypothesis of tetrahedral symmetry of an atomic nucleus was put forward as early as in the 1970s for @xmath8o @xcite in relation to its expected four-@xmath9 cluster structure . since the 1990s , such concept has been extended also to the heavier systems , e.g. @xcite and then intensively studied , both within microscopic - macroscopic ( mm ) @xcite and selfconsistent models @xcite . generally , these studies are inconclusive since : a ) the existence of global tetrahedral minima was rare and model - dependent b ) contradictory results were obtained within the same models .",
    "similar ambiguity occurs also in experiments which so far either did not give a clear evidence @xcite or even gave a strong evidence against tetrahedral symmetry @xcite .",
    "for example , negative - parity bands in @xmath10dy , observed quite recently @xcite , are most likely related to the octupole excitations rather than the exotic tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "here we summarize the results of a search for tetrahedral minima in heavy and super - heavy nuclei obtained within the mm model based on the deformed woods - saxon potential with parameters used many times before , therefore well tested in this region .",
    "the present work is a much improved version of @xcite , extended to odd-@xmath11 and odd - odd nuclei , with an expanded space of deformations used for searching ground - state ( absolute ) tetrahedral minima .",
    "the microscopic - macroscopic results were obtained with the deformed woods - saxon potential .",
    "the nuclear deformation enters via a definition of the nuclear surface @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the volume - fixing factor .",
    "the real - valued spherical harmonics @xmath14 , with even @xmath15 , are defined in terms of the usual ones as : @xmath16 . in other words",
    ", we consider shapes with two symmetry planes .",
    "note , that traditional quadrupole deformations @xmath17 and @xmath18 are related to @xmath19 and @xmath20 by : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23 lowest proton levels and @xmath24 lowest neutron levels from the @xmath25 lowest shells of the deformed oscillator were taken into account in the diagonalization procedure .",
    "for the macroscopic part we used the yukawa plus exponential model @xcite .",
    "all parameters used in the present work , determining the s.p .",
    "potential , the pairing strength , and the macroscopic energy , are equal to those used previously in the calculations of masses @xcite and fission barriers @xcite in actinides and the heaviest nuclei .",
    "in particular , we took the `` universal set '' of potential parameters and the pairing strengths @xmath26 for neutrons , @xmath27 for protons ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "as always within this model , @xmath29 neutron and @xmath30 proton s.p .",
    "levels have been included when solving bcs equations . for systems with odd proton or neutron ( or both )",
    "we use blocking .",
    "we assume the g.s .",
    "configuration consisting of an odd particle occupying one of the levels close to the fermi level and the rest of the particles forming a paired bcs state on the remaining levels .",
    "any minimum , including the ground state , is found by minimizing over configurations , blocking particles on levels from the 10-th below to 10-th above the fermi level .",
    "we performed three types of calculations looking for both conditional and ground - state tetrahedral minima in nearly 3000 heavy and superheavy nuclei with @xmath31 .",
    "\\1 ) conditional tetrahedral minima were found by fixing quadrupole deformations at zero : @xmath32 , and calculating total energy with the step 0.02 in @xmath0 by minimization over the other seven deformation parameters : @xmath5 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the occurence of a minimum at @xmath39 in such an energy plot ( after additional interpolation of the energy to the step 0.01 in @xmath0 ) signals the conditional minimum , usually excited above the g.s .",
    "the rationale behind this procedure is that , as known from other studies , quadrupole deformation does not cooperate with the tetrahedral one @xcite , and switching off the effects of the quadrupole might help to locate a prominent tetrahedral shell effect at sizable deformation @xmath0 .",
    "\\2 ) the ground states in all nuclei were found initially by the minimization over seven axial deformations @xmath40 , @xmath41 - 8 .",
    "\\3 ) finally , the ground states were found for the second time , by the minimization over ten deformations : the axial ones from 2 ) plus @xmath20 , @xmath0 , and @xmath34 .    in additional calculations , for a restricted region of sh nuclei in which the minima found in 3 ) were @xmath42 mev deeper than those resulting from 2 ) , we minimized energy with respect to nine deformations , excluding @xmath0 .",
    "the aim was to see whether the effect is driven by @xmath0 .    in all calculations we used one non - axial version of the ws code to eliminate possible numerical differences which could follow from the different imposed spatial symmetries .",
    "when looking for ground state minima , a minimization for each nucleus was repeated at least 30 times , with various starting points , in order to ensure that the proper ground state was found .",
    "as , especially for superheavy nuclei , the minimization can end behind the fission barrier , only minima within the the fission barrier were accepted .",
    "the map of tetrahedral deformations in the obtained conditional minima is shown in fig .",
    "1 . we emphasize that in these minima the quadrupole deformation was forced to vanish in order to exhibit large tetrahedral shell effects .",
    "as may be seen , the largest @xmath0 reach @xmath43 .",
    "the conditional tetrahedral minima with sizable @xmath44 occur in three regions : a wide region around @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and two very exotic regions : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , @xmath48 .",
    "this , however , should be confronted with the excitation energies of the conditional minima above the axially symmetric g.s .",
    "minima [ found in calculations no .",
    "2 ) ] , shown in fig .",
    "as may be seen there , the low excitation energies in the _ a priori _ interesting first region occur in neutron rich @xmath50 nuclei and in the very neutron deficient @xmath51 isotopes which probably can not be reached in experiment .",
    "there are some very exotic nuclei in which the conditional tetrahedral minima lie lower than the axially symmetric ones , but the largest difference is only 0.25 mev .",
    "the conclusion from this part of the study is that in the whole investigated region there are no prominent low - energy tetrahedral minima .     at the conditional minima obtained by setting @xmath32 ;",
    "the minimization performed over 7 other deformation parameters ( see text ) . ]     above the axially symmetric g.s . ]    among the group of neutron - rich @xmath52 - 94 nuclei , there are altogether fourteen conditional minima below 2 mev excitation energy : nine in po isotopes , four in rn isotopes , and in @xmath53np .",
    "an example of the energy landscape of a nucleus @xmath54po , with coexisting shallow , nearly degenerate minima : with @xmath55 and the wide prolate-@xmath5 one , is shown in fig .",
    "3 , in three projections : ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , ( @xmath19 , @xmath5 ) , and ( @xmath19 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "these maps were obtained by using all 10 deformations by the minimization over 8 remaining ones .",
    "the unusual landscape may be interpreted as two competing minima with a slight barrier between them .",
    "concerning the excited minima , the important question is whether they are protected by a barrier from the transition to the axially symmetric g.s .",
    "the typical situation is shown in fig .",
    "4 , for the nucleus @xmath56rn . the landscape in ( @xmath57 ) plane was obtained by the minimmization over 8 remaining deformations . one can see that the conditional minimum with @xmath58 is not a minimum after lifting the constraint on @xmath19 : the very shallow real tetrahedral minimum occurs at @xmath59 and @xmath60 which is smaller than @xmath61 of the conditional minimum .",
    "the barrier between the tetrahedral and the axial prolate g.s .",
    "minimum is less than 300 kev .",
    "one has to notice though , that the presented picture involves the minimization over other deformations , while finding the height of the saddle would require another method , like , for example , the imaginary water flow ( e.g. @xcite ) , applied in the whole deformation hypercube .    ,",

    "they are shown in fig .",
    "5 . in many of them ,",
    "the effect comes entirely from the quadrupole and hexadecapole nonaxiality ( @xmath20 and @xmath34 ) .",

    "the energy differences greater than 200 kev between non - axial and axial minima occur in rather exotic nuclei .",
    "for example , the purely tetrahedral effect occurs in the neutron - poor es isotope with @xmath73 neutrons and in ultra - neutron - rich es isotopes with @xmath74 , and also in a few nuclei around them .     and octupole @xmath5 and @xmath0 are below the axial ones . ]",

    "it turns out that including terahedral deformation induces also oblate quadrupole and the _ axial octupole _",
    "the obtained minima , corresponding to moderately oblate shapes with octupole distortions in the ratio : @xmath6 are equivalent to the octupole deformation @xmath7 superimposed on the oblate shape along its symmetry axis .",

    "as previously , these maps are obtained by minimizing over the remaining eight deformation parameters .",
    "the oblate-@xmath7 minima are lower by 720 and 530 kev , respectively , than the axially symmetric oblate minima . as there is no barrier between both , the previously found axially symmetric minima were spurious .",
    "one has to mention that the depth of the oblate-@xmath7 minima diminishes with increasing pairing strengths which is especially relevant in odd-@xmath11 and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "as we have checked , at least some of these minima survive even after a 10% increase in pairing strengths which corresponds to a considerable increase in rather weak g.s . pairing correlations of the original model .",
    "for example , such a change leads to the @xmath7 g.s . in @xmath83123",
    "still lying by 450 kev lower than the axially symmetric minimum .",
    "the results obtained for about 3000 heavy and superheavy nuclei by the microscopic - macroscopic model based on the deformed woods - saxon potential and the yukawa - plus - exponential energy within the ten - dimensional space of deformations may be summarized as follows :    - we could not find any deep minima of large tetrahedral deformation .",
    "the conditional minima , found under the restriction of zero quadrupole distortion , have mostly a large excitation and are not protected by any substantial barrier .",
    "minima relatively soft with respect to the tetrahedral coordinate @xmath0 occur in po isotopes with @xmath88 and in a few very exotic ( off @xmath17 - stability ) systems .",
