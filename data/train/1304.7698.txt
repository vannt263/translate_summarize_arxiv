    "the @xmath2 reaction has shown an intriguing feature since the cross section exhibits a very narrow peak around @xmath9 of about @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass distribution also shows a preference for the two pions having an invariant mass close to two pion masses .",
    "the quantum numbers of the reaction demand that the @xmath11 state is in isospin @xmath5 which in turn also calls for @xmath12 of the pair of pions to allow them to go together and have an invariant mass closer to the threshold of the two pions .",
    "the narrowness of the signal has prompted the authors of @xcite to claim that it is most probably due to the formation of a dibaryon resonance .",
    "the search for dibaryons has been a recurring subject , so far filled only with negative results .",
    "the confirmation of a dibaryon as being responsible for the reaction would undeniably be an important discovery .",
    "the first problem one faces in the dibaryon interpretation is that the @xmath2 reaction is done as a fusion process .",
    "the @xmath4 scattering is actually done using a deuteron target and arguments are given in @xcite to show that the proton in the deuteron is acting as a spectator .",
    "hence , the reaction proceeds via the breakup of the target deuteron followed by the recombination of the deuteron from the neutron of the target and the proton of the beam , according to @xcite",
    ". one might think that it is easier to make the scattering on the original deuteron that is not broken and remains in the final state , and actually this is an unavoidable part of the mechanisms of the actual reaction , although the cuts made to demand that the proton of the initial deuteron acts as a spectator should make that mechanism subdominant .",
    "yet , it is unclear what its unavoidable interference with the dominant mechanism could be .",
    "one can look for other possible reasons for the narrow peak .",
    "assuming the fusion reaction to be responsible for it , if one has a long range @xmath13-channel mechanism for the production ( imagine for instance @xmath14 production mediated by pion exchange ) , the fusion reaction involves the deuteron wave function in momentum space in a way that could magnify certain kinematics .",
    "the fact is that although possible explanations could be given related to the the way the deuteron wave function enters the fusion reaction , no theoretical study along these lines has been done .",
    "the hypothesis of the dibaryon resonance then stands without a contradiction so far .",
    "one step forward to show possible contradictions was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors take the experimental cross section of the @xmath2 reaction , assuming it to be formed by a resonance in the entrance channel , and relate it to the cross section of the @xmath15 reaction with the positive energy @xmath4 system in the final state having the same quantum numbers as the deuteron , @xmath5 , @xmath6 . using approximate techniques to take into account the final state interaction in the case of @xmath16 or @xmath4 formation",
    ", the authors can determine the resonant cross section for @xmath15 reaction , having a strength at the peak of about @xmath17 . or @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath18 is the case favored in @xcite we refer to the numbers of @xcite for @xmath18 . ] to this cross section , one should add the background contribution from many other quantum numbers in the final state and compare with the total experimental cross section for the @xmath15 reaction .",
    "unfortunately there are no data for this reaction and the authors urged the experiment to be performed to clarify the issue .    in @xcite",
    "the consistency with the inelasticity in the @xmath19 cross section was also investigated and it was found that the inelastic @xmath19 cross section based only on the resonant mechanism exceeded the experimental cross section of the @xmath20 partial wave obtained from the said analysis of @xcite , and was barely below the sum of the two partial waves @xmath21 , which are possible with @xmath22 in the entrance channel . in between , the normalization of the data used for the @xmath2 reaction has been reduced from @xmath17 at the peak to @xmath23 in @xcite and now the estimated @xmath19 inelastic cross section from the @xmath15 reaction with @xmath4 having the deuteron quantum numbers alone would be well below the experiment .    in between",
    ", some important experimental information has appeared from the measurement of the @xmath1 cross section around the peak of the @xmath2 one . since the @xmath24 state has also @xmath5 component , it was certainly a puzzle that the narrow peak seen in the @xmath2 cross section was not seen in the @xmath1 .",
    "yet , the high precision data for this latter reaction measured in @xcite also show a clear and narrow peak exactly at the same position as the @xmath2 reaction , with a strength at the peak about twice as big as for @xmath2 , as demanded by isospin symmetry .    with this latter information it becomes most advisable to conduct the same test as in @xcite , relating",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath3 cross sections , because now the predictions for the latter reaction can be compared with the experimental data @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can also use a more elaborate model to account for final state interaction than used in @xcite , which was based on the use of the @xmath4 scattering amplitude in the deuteron channel as being dominated by the deuteron pole . in the present paper",
    "we shall study the final state interaction using techniques developed in the chiral unitary approach @xcite .",
    "using unitarity in coupled channels and the @xmath25 method it was found that it was justified to make an on shell factorization of the potential and the t - matrix in the bethe salpeter equation @xcite which renders this equation an algebraic one for each partial wave .",
    "furthermore , we shall also use results from @xcite , where the link between scattering amplitudes of the chiral unitary approach and wave functions in coordinate space is made and a meaning is found for the couplings of a bound state or a resonance to the interacting particles . using these theoretical techniques and the recent data for the @xmath1 reaction from @xcite , we shall see that the predicted cross section for the @xmath3 reaction with @xmath4 with the deuteron quantum numbers , assuming it to be due to the dibaryon formation , nearly equals the experimental total cross section for this reaction at the energy where the @xmath26 cross section peaks . by adding a necessary background , which is obtained by a fit to the @xmath8 data adding the resonance contribution and a background parametrized in different ways , the total cross section obtained exceeds the experimental one around the energy of the resonant peak . while this poses a problem to the dibaryon hypothesis",

    "this is because the @xmath17 cross section used in @xcite at the peak was changed to @xmath23 in @xcite .",

    "we compared this cross section with the total experimental one for the @xmath3 reaction and found that it was quite close to the experiment at the peak of the resonance .",
    "we then added a background from unavoidable standard nonresonant channels , which summed to the resonant contribution was fitted to present @xmath27 data , and found that the total cross section exceeds the experimental one around @xmath0 , where one has the peak of the @xmath26 cross section .",
    "we could admit uncertainties of about 20% in the size of the @xmath139 cross section ( as also admitted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the fit with the resonant plus background contributions leads to results basically the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_2 ] .",
    "hence , based on this scarce experimental information , this excess puts a problem to the hypothesis of the dibaryon resonance as being responsible for the narrow peak observed in the @xmath2 and @xmath1 reactions . in view of this",
    ", we can recommend two lines of research to further clarify this problem .",
    "the first one is to work on theoretical models for @xmath140 , and concretely for the @xmath141 , reactions .",
    "for some mechanisms which involve a light particle ( a pion ) exchange in the @xmath13-channel , the consideration of the deuteron wave function is bound to constraint some distributions in the phase space that can repercute also in the cross section as a function of the energy .",
    "some steps in this direction were done in @xcite in the study of the @xmath2 reaction using the model of @xcite , but at much lower energies than those discussed here .",
    "the second line of suggested research is the measurement of the @xmath3 cross section with good resolution around the region of @xmath9 , where the peak of the cross sections in the deuteron production processes is seen .",
    "we have clearly shown that a large resonant cross section should develop as a consequence of the assumption of a resonant formation in the entrance channel .",
    "so far , the scarce data around this energy do not let us see the shape as a function of energy .",
    "a combination of efforts in those or other directions to clarify why such a narrow peak appears in the deuteron fusion reactions are much needed to see if the resonance hypothesis stands .",
    "we should note that many of the data points are very old , and present experimental facilities at cosy , hades and other can provide measurements with far better accuracy . in view of this , we urge that experimental efforts are devoted to this task which , combined with the findings of the present paper , should help clarify this interesting problem .",

    "<S> we use recent data that show a narrow peak around @xmath0 in the @xmath1 cross section , with about double strength at the peak than in the analogous @xmath2 reaction , and , assuming that it is due to the excitation of a dibaryon resonance , we evaluate the cross section for the @xmath3 reaction , with the final @xmath4 unbound but with the same quantum numbers as the deuteron . </S>",
    "<S> we use accurate techniques to determine the final state interaction in the case of the @xmath4 forming a deuteron or a positive energy state , which allow us to get the @xmath3 cross section with @xmath4 in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , that turns out to be quite close or saturates the experimental @xmath3 total cross section around @xmath7 , depending on the angular momentum assumed . </S>",
    "<S> we then parametrize a background with different methods , and the sum of the resonant and background contributions is fitted to present data . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting cross section exceeds the experimental results in the region of the resonant peak , showing a problem in the dibaryon hypothesis . yet , in view of the dispersion of present experimental data , and the scarce information around @xmath7 , a call is made for precise measurements of the @xmath8 reaction around this energy , to further clarify this issue .    </S>"
