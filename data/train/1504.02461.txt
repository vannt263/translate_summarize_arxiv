    "this has motivated intensive theoretical efforts to understand fundamental aspects of the dynamics in interacting many - body systems , and leads to predictions in marked contrast to the naive expectation that interactions imply rapid thermalization @xcite : integrable systems can keep memory of the initial state for all times and relax to a generalized gibbs ensemble @xcite , but also away from integrability thermalization can be delayed by prethermalizaton @xcite , and one can identify regimes of different dynamical behavior which are clearly separated by non - thermal critical points @xcite .    of particular interest with respect to complex phases in condensed matter is the dynamics of symmetry broken - states @xcite .",
    "while the relevant relaxation mechanisms after a perturbation are hard to disentangle in a solid , cold atoms in optical lattices provide a versatile platform to investigate isolated quantum systems in ideal situations .",
    "the preparation of thermodynamic long - range ordered phases in cold atoms is still a challenge @xcite , but advanced techniques for lattice design have made it possible to prepare an ordered state on a lattice of isolated sites , and to probe its dynamics after tunneling between the sites is switched on @xcite . in the following we consider such a setup for the fermi - hubbard model , a paradigm model for emergent long - range order in condensed matter systems",

    ", one can anticipate fundamentally different pathways for melting of long - range antiferromagnetic order in the weakly and strongly interacting hubbard model : for strong interaction , long - range order arises from antiferromagnetically coupled local moments , which emerge when charge fluctuations are frozen .",
    "magnetic order could thus possibly melt via the destruction of the local moments themselves , through a reduction of the effective exchange interaction @xcite ( while moments persist ) , or , along a quasi - thermal pathway , by the transfer of energy from excited quasiparticles ( hot electrons ) to spins .",
    "the latter mechanism is intensively studied in the context of photo - carrier relaxation in high - t@xmath0 cuprates @xcite , where the investigation of the spin - charge interaction challenges the limits for the time - resolution in state of the art pump - probe experiments @xcite . for weak interaction , on the other hand",
    ", quasiparticle states may be important to understand relaxation processes . in the paramagnetic phase the conservation of the quasiparticle momentum occupations imposes constraints on the dynamics which can lead to prethermalization @xcite .",
    "prethermalizaton , which was recently observed in a one - dimensional bose gas @xcite , has been suggested to be a universal feature of near - integrable systems @xcite , but previous predictions for the hubbard model rely on a discontinuity of the momentum distribution which is absent at nonzero temperature and thus experimentally hard to observe .",
    "here we show that the symmetry - broken initial state provides an alternative perspective to investigate this physics and its breakdown far from integrability .",
    "quenches from a nel state have been explored in quantum spin models @xcite , also as a way to prepare ordered states in the hubbard model @xcite , but a pure spin model can not describe the relevant dynamics of charge excitations and local moments . the hubbard model has been studied in one dimension using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite . for the dynamics of lattice fermion models in more than one dimension ,",
    "nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite is the most promising approach .",
    "quenches within the antiferromagnetic phase of the hubbard model at strong - coupling @xcite are in line with the `` quasi - thermal '' pathway discussed above .",
    "the regime of intermediate interactions , where the notion of local moments becomes ambiguous , or to weak coupling , where prethermalization may be expected , has been elusive so far .",
    "previous numerical solutions of the dmft equations were based on the self - consistent strong - coupling expansion @xcite or weak - coupling impurity solvers  @xcite , which both fail at intermediate coupling , while weak - coupling quantum monte carlo studies @xcite are most efficient for noninteracting initial states and restricted to short times . in this work",
    "we overcome these limitations using a recently developed hamiltonian based formulation for the impurity model of nonequilibrium dmft @xcite , which has opened the possibility to use wave - function based techniques to solve the dmft equations @xcite . here",
    "we use dmrg as an impurity solver @xcite , which allows us to reach sufficiently long times in the evolution to address the above issues .",

    "@xcite . to second order in @xmath2 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is unitarily equivalent to a model @xmath69 which is quadratic in terms of quasiparticle operators @xmath70 ; we have @xmath71 with a finite residue @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes incoherent contributions , i.e. , an admixture of particle - hole excitations to higher order in @xmath2 .",
    "hence the momentum occupation is given by @xmath74 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath75 ( the coherent part ) is unchanged by the time evolution to second order in @xmath2 .",
    "back - transforming gives @xmath76 , where the incoherent contribution is a smooth function of @xmath42 .",
    "for quenches in the paramagnetic phase , @xmath77 thus preserves the initial discontinuity at the fermi surface , which can be taken as a measure of prethermalization @xcite . in the symmetry broken state , however , @xmath78 is independent of @xmath42 , and thus @xmath77 does not clearly exhibit the existence of residual quasiparticles .",
    "in fact , the numerical results suggest that the incoherent part can accurately be described by a thermal distribution . in contrast , a similar argument for the off - diagonal component shows that @xmath79 , where we have used the time evolution of the quasiparticle , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "hence we find that the residual quasiparticle dynamics leading to prethermalization close to the integrable point @xmath37 can be studied very conveniently with the symmetry broken initial state in terms of oscillations in the off - diagonal components of the momentum occupation .",
    "similar to the interaction quench in the paramagnetic phase @xcite , we find that the `` prethermalization '' regime in which residual quasiparticles dominate the dynamics is limited to small interactions ; at large interactions , @xmath61 relaxes to zero monotonously ( see the @xmath82 data in fig .

    "[ fig3]b ) .    before discussing the strong - coupling regime",
    ", we note that off - diagonal momentum distributions can in principle be measured by a modified time - of - flight measurement , if before releasing the cloud , one would switch off the tunneling and the interaction , switch on a staggered potential which is @xmath93 on the a and b sub - lattice , respectively , and evolve for a given time @xmath94 .",

    "in a mott insulator at large @xmath2 one can expect the existence of well - defined local moments .",
    "it is an intriguing question whether these moments persist in the quenched state while the long - range order disappears , and to what extent the crossover in relaxation behavior from weak to strong coupling can be characterized in terms of these local moments . in the following ,",
    "we propose a simple experiment to distinguish the existence and strength of moments in the quenched state : one spin in the initial nel state on a given site ( the probe site `` @xmath101 '' ) is flipped to the @xmath102-direction ( see fig .",

    "<S> melting of long - range order occurs due to the ultra - fast transfer of energy from charge excitations to the spin background , while local magnetic moments and their exchange coupling persist during the process . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be demonstrated by a local spin - precession experiment . at weak interaction , local moments decay along with the long - range order . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics is governed by residual quasiparticles , which are reflected in oscillations of the off - diagonal components of the momentum distribution . </S>",
