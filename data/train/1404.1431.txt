    "thus , the x - mode and o - mode components of initial emission are separated in pulsar magnetosphere , the observed polarization intensity at a given rotation phase should be the incoherent mixture of the x - mode and o - mode emission cones from discrete emission positions . _",

    "fig : beam_rot ] and [ fig : profiles ] ) , which means the final profiles could have significant polarization with different modes .",
    "since the refraction bend the o - mode emissions towards the outer part of pulsar beam , the final polarization profiles usually show the `` o  x  o '' modes in phases , with the x - mode dominating the central part and the o - mode at the two wings , which agrees with predictions by @xcite and observations shown by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the asymmetric intensity distribution of x - mode and o - mode emission caused by the additional co - rotation of particles can be used to understand the high degrees of linear polarization .    in this paper , we studied the emission from curvature radiations with or without the rotation involved , and the initial propagation ( i.e. `` adiabatic walking '' and refraction ) of the polarized waves within pulsar magnetosphere . when the waves propagate outwards , other propagation effects , e.g. wave mode coupling , should be considered since it could alter the polarization states .",

    "the plasma generated through the cascade process in the polar cap region can be hot and has a wide energy distribution @xcite . meanwhile , the sparking process may also lead to irregular density patches .",
    "nevertheless , only if the o - mode components are coupled to the superluminous o - mode can they leave the magnetosphere , which suggests the intrinsical nonlinear process @xcite .",
    "however , little is known about the nonlinear process up to now . in our calculations for the coherent curvature radiation , the coherency",
    "is simply treated by assuming the coherent bunch to be a huge point charge .",
    "however , the actual coherent manner , both in the bunching form of particles and the maser - type instabilities , will lead to diverse radiation patterns . in our study , the dipole magnetosphere is used to investigate the curvature radiation and propagation processes , while the distortion of the dipole magnetosphere caused either by pulsar rotation or by the polar cap current @xcite is not considered .",
    "these factors will make the final emergent radiation much more complicated @xcite and should be investigated in the future .",

    "<S> the propagation of polarized emission in pulsar magnetosphere is investigated in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the polarized waves are generated through curvature radiation from the relativistic particles streaming along curved magnetic field lines and co - rotating with the pulsar magnetosphere . within the @xmath0 emission cone , </S>",
    "<S> the waves can be divided into two natural wave mode components , the ordinary ( o ) mode and the extraordinary ( x ) mode , with comparable intensities . </S>",
    "<S> both components propagate separately in magnetosphere , and are aligned within the cone by adiabatic walking . </S>",
    "<S> the refraction of o - mode makes the two components separated and incoherent . </S>",
    "<S> the detectable emission at a given height and a given rotation phase consists of incoherent x - mode and o - mode components coming from discrete emission regions . for four particle - density models in the form of uniformity , cone , core and patches </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the intensities for each mode numerically within the entire pulsar beam . if the co - rotation of relativistic particles with magnetosphere is not considered , the intensity distributions for the x - mode and o - mode components are quite similar within the pulsar beam , which causes serious depolarization . however , if the co - rotation of relativistic particles is considered , the intensity distributions of the two modes are very different , and the net polarization of out - coming emission should be significant . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results are compared with observations , and can naturally explain the orthogonal polarization modes of some pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> strong linear polarizations of some parts of pulsar profile can be reproduced by curvature radiation and subsequent propagation effect .    </S>",
