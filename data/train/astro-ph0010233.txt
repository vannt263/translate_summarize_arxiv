    "one of the main observables of pulsar emission is its flux density @xmath3 , measured at a given central frequency @xmath4 of the receiver bandwidth .",
    "flux measurements are crucial for deriving , the so called , pulsar luminosity function and therefore the birth rate of the galactic population of neutron stars .",
    "the first spectrum of a pulsar taken at 5 frequencies was published by robinson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the flux density variations and spectra for frequencies between 0.15 and 1.6 ghz were later reported for a number of pulsars by mclean ( @xcite ) .",
    "spectra of 27 pulsars were published by sieber ( @xcite ) who used pulse energy values obtained with the 100-m and 25-m telescopes of the max - planck - institute for radioastronomy ( mpifr ) as well as other values published in the literature .",
    "he was the first to show a turn - over behaviour at low frequencies around 100 mhz and a break in spectrum at high frequencies ( about 1 ghz ) .",
    "sieber et al .",
    "( @xcite ) published pulse shapes and their energies for 35 pulsars at 2.7 and 4.9 ghz , and for 7 pulsars at 10.7 ghz .",
    "izvekova et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and slee et al . (",
    "@xcite ) presented an analysis of flux measurements for pulsars at meter wavelengths ( @xmath2  80 mhz ) .",
    "a compilation of spectra of 45 pulsars over a wide frequency range was published for the first time by malofeev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "seiradakis et al .",
    "( @xcite ) published a collection of high frequency data on pulsar profiles and flux densities for 183 pulsars at 1.4 ghz , 46 pulsars at 4.85 ghz and 24 pulsars at 10.5 ghz .",
    "the catalogue of pulsar flux density measurements for 281 pulsars at frequencies ranging from 0.4 ghz to 1.6 ghz was published by lorimer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the first spectra for four millisecond pulsars were published by foster et al .",

    "( @xcite ) studied the emission properties of millisecond pulsars up 4.85 ghz .",
    "a first large sample of flux densities of weak pulsars at 4.85 ghz was published by kijak et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been long believed that flux density spectra for most of the pulsars have been well described by a simple power law @xmath5 with spectral index of @xmath6 ( sieber @xcite and lorimer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , a considerable fraction of pulsars demonstrated spectra that required modelling by two power laws ( sieber @xcite and malofeev et al .",
    "these were commonly called the broken - type spectra . in this paper",
    "we show that the two power law spectra are rare exception and that majority of pulsars can be modelled by a single power law .",
    "our analysis shows that only 10% of pulsars requires two power law spectra .",
    "recently , pulsar flux density measurements have been extended to the mm - wavelengths region , which provided information about this newly explored spectral region .",
    "these measurements suggested that spectrum flattens out or even turns up at very high frequencies ( kramer et al .",

    "we present a new and most complete compilation of spectra for 281 pulsars in the frequency range from 39 mhz to 43 ghz .",
