    "the standard model of diffusion and its variants have many applications , for example , in solid state physics ( @xcite ) , environmental modeling ( @xcite ) , image processing ( @xcite ) and inverse problems ( @xcite ) . for these applications the standard diffusion model ( @xcite )",
    "@xmath3 is usually modified by replacing the diffusion constant @xmath4 by a tensor that takes inhomogenities or anisotropy of the medium into account .",
    "recently _ sub - diffusion _ ( very slow diffusion ) and _ super - diffusion _ ( very fast diffusion ) have been modeled by a completely different approach where the time derivative in  ( [ stddiffeq ] ) is replaced by a fractional time derivative ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although , many of these models ( or their discretizations ) are successfully used in applications , they violate the principle of causality . by causality we mean , for example , that a characteristic feature of a process like an _ interface _ or a _ front _ must propagate with a finite speed .",
    "it is peculiar that causality is a fundamental concept in physics of wave propagation and the respective mathematical theory of hyperbolic equations , but it is ignored in physics of diffusion and the respective mathematical theory of parabolic equations and stochastic processes .",
    "is it so difficult - or even impossible - to find a causal model of diffusion ?",
    "it seems that processes like diffusion are more `` complicated '' than processes related to waves , but as a matter of fact many of the standard models of wave propagation in _ dissipative media _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) lack causality , too .",
    "causality demands a coupling of space and time and therefore forbids _ model equations _ that are to  simple \" .",
    "hence , apart from its physical significance , it is interesting to study causality from the mathematical point of view .",
    "even if causality is not relevant for many applications , which is not really clear yet , there is no mathematical reason to ignore this issue .",
    "it is the concern of this paper to model and analyze a causal model of diffusion .",
    "the paper consists of essentially two parts .",
    "first we show that causal diffusion can not satisfy the strongly continuous semigroup property and its respective evolution equation .",
    "more precisely , we show that a process decribed by the _ scalar - valued _ evolution equation @xmath5 where the space convolution operator @xmath6 is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous semigroup ( @xcite ) , can not satisfy causality .",
    "that is to say , there exists a fundamental solution @xmath7 of  ( [ evolequv ] ) that does not satisfy @xmath8 for a positive constant @xmath9 .",
    "this causality condition can be interpreted as follows : consider the diffusion of an ink droplet of radius @xmath10 dropped in water at time @xmath11 .",
    "then causality demands that the ink water interface propagates with a finite speed bounded by @xmath9 .",
    "even if there is no interface ( visible ) , the concentration @xmath1 of ink must vanish outside a closed ball of radius @xmath12 .",
    "although diffusion equation  ( [ stddiffeq ] ) does not satisfy  ( [ causagcond ] ) , many scientists consider this equation as _ weak causal _ ( or shortly as _ causal _ ) , since there exists a fundamental solution @xmath13 that satisfies @xmath14 however , this property has nothing to do with causality . as a consequence , the problem of causality has beed ignored .    the second and larger part of this paper presents and analyzes a causal model of diffusion . in case of constant speed @xmath9 of diffusion",
    ", the model reads as follows @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes a small time period , @xmath17 is such that @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 denotes the lebesgue surface measure on @xmath21 and @xmath22 denotes the surface area of the sphere @xmath23 .",
    "this diffusion modell satisfies causality , the semigroup property on the discrete set of time points @xmath24 and @xmath25 is discontinuous at @xmath26 for each @xmath27 .",
    "thus model  ( [ defcausdiff10 ] ) constitutes a compromise between causality and the strongly continuous semigroup property .",
    "physically , this model describes a transport process of mass during which the masses split up at time points @xmath26 and then spread out in each direction without interfering.$ ] of speeds does not satisfy the strongly continuous semigroup property , but the splitting up of masses take place at each time point @xmath28 for some @xmath29 . ] as a consequence , not each space - time point has a unique velocity vector , but the _ general continuity equation _",
    "@xmath30 holds with _ flux density _",

    "] @xmath36 note if @xmath37 say under the side condition @xmath38 , then @xmath39 , i.e. causality does not hold for this limit .",
    "finally , we show that the diffusion process  ( [ defcausdiff10 ] ) satisfies an inhomogeneous wave equation with time dependent coefficient such that mass is conserved .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - semigroups ] we prove under fairly reasonable assumptions that causal diffusion can not satisfy the property of a strongly continuous semigroup . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we put some of the technical parts of the proof of the main theorem in the appendix .",
    "subsequently we present and analyze a causal diffusion model in section  [ sec - causalmodel ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a short section of conclusion ( section  [ sec - conclusion ] ) .",
    "it is common in science to assume that the operator @xmath6 in  ( [ evolequv ] ) has nice properties like linearity , translation invariance and some kind of smoothness such that it can infered that @xmath6 is a space convolution operator .",
    "theorem 4.2.1 in  @xcite provides such a list of necessary properties .",
    "for example , translation and rotation invariance of @xmath6 means that the medium in which the process takes place is homogeneous and isotropic . in this section",
    "we assume that @xmath6 is a _ space convolution operator _ and an _ ( infinitesimal ) generator _ of a strongly continuous semigroup in @xmath40 and prove that the solution of evolution equation  ( [ evolequv ] ) can not satisfy causality condition  ( [ causagcond ] ) .",
    "this result suggests that even if some of the nice properties of @xmath6 are dropped , causality can not be restored .",
    "and therefore we present a new model for causal diffusion that do not satisfy the semigroup property for all time points in the following section .    for the convenience of the reader we put the technical parts of the proof of the main theorem in the appendix .",
    "+      the notion of the fourier transform and the convolution used in this paper are specified at the beginning of the appendix .",
    "moreover , we use the following notion    [ defaa ] let @xmath41 and @xmath42 be a positive and rotational symmetric function such that @xmath43 moreover , let @xmath44 . the operator @xmath45 is defined as the convolution operator @xmath46 here @xmath47 denotes the convolution with respect to the space variable @xmath48 .",
    "this definition is reasonable , since the convolution @xmath49 of distributions @xmath50 and @xmath51 is well - defined and lies in @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "+ let @xmath53 and @xmath6 be as in definition  [ defaa ] .",

    "e.g. chapter xvii in  @xcite or chapter 7.4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 satisfies the evolution equation @xmath57 with initial condition @xmath58 here @xmath59 denotes the _ dirac delta distribution _ on @xmath21 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath60 is a semigroup with a generator @xmath6 that is a space convolution operator with kernel @xmath61 , then @xmath13 defined as in  ( [ defg ] ) satisfies  ( [ relstg ] ) and  ( [ evoleqg ] ) with  ( [ initevoleqg ] ) .",
    "the assumption that @xmath53 is rotational symmetric is motivated by the following fact .",
    "if a process takes place in a homogeneous and isotropic medium , then - by symmetry - the fundamental solution @xmath62 of the respectively evolution equation must be rotational symmetric in @xmath63 . and",
    "consequently , @xmath53 is rotational symmetric , too . since this paper is a first approach on causality of semigroups and its evolution equations , we focus on these special types of processes .",

    "@xmath64 where @xmath4 is a constant .",

    "moreover , @xmath13 satisfies the standard diffusion equation  ( [ stddiffeq ] ) with @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67      we first investigate the properties of @xmath68 , the fourier transform of the kernel @xmath61 of the operator @xmath6 . for this purpose",
    "we recall some facts about _ holomorphic roots . _    if @xmath69 and @xmath70 are entire functions such that @xmath71 , then we call @xmath70 an @xmath72th holomorphic root of @xmath69 .",

    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 denotes the @xmath72th derivative of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath80 . for a proof of this statement see the `` wurzelkriterium '' in chapter 3 section 1 in  @xcite .",

    "the first statement is well - known ( cf .",

    ", each @xmath81 divides @xmath76 and consequently @xmath76 must be zero .",
    "but this means that @xmath69 has no zeros which concludes the proof .",
