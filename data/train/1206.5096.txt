    "in spite of real - world qcd being neither supersymmetric nor conformal invariant , it shares many features with @xmath0 sym .",
    "both theories are identical when loops of quarks and scalars do not appear , i.e. at tree - level , and in the leading @xmath1 term of the high - energy limit , where the scattering is dominated by exchange of a gluon ladder in the @xmath2-channel .",
    "the infrared structure of both theories is similar at the level of soft divergences .",
    "it is interesting to look for regimes where qcd and @xmath0 give similar predictions . with this target in mind",
    "we will study both theories in the regge limit @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath2 the usual mandelstam invariants .",
    "to define the observables of interest , we consider the kinematic configuration of fig . [ dijet ] , the well - known mueller - navelet jets @xcite .",
    "two forward jets with similar transverse scales @xmath5 are tagged at a large rapidity separation @xmath6 and relative azimuthal angle @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the fractions of longitudinal momenta of the parent hadrons carried by the jet .",
    "such a configuration is particularly suited to unveil qcd dynamics in the high - energy limit , specifically through the study of dijet azimuthal correlation @xcite .",
    "the large value of @xmath9 calls for a resummation of high - energy logarithms of the form @xmath10 .",
    "this resummation is performed in the bfkl approach @xcite , and the differential cross section for dijet production at the parton level . ]",
    "is given by    @xmath11    in terms of the mellin transform of the solution to the bfkl equation    @xmath12    in the leading log approximation , this equation enjoys conformal sl(2,@xmath13 invariance in the plane transverse to the colliding partons @xcite , and the integral kernel @xmath14 is diagonalised by the eigenfunctions @xmath15 . the discrete quantum number @xmath16 controls the azimuthal behaviour in the transverse plane and corresponds to a conformal spin , since it carries a representation of sl(2,@xmath13 .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the asympotic intercepts of the kernel corresponding to @xmath17 are very similar at ll and nll , not having the weak convergence problem of the @xmath18 case corresponding to the pomeron intercept which needs an all - orders collinear resummation  @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to look for observables insensitive to the conformal spin @xmath18 .",
    "+ we consider the fourier expansion of the differential cross section in the azimuthal angle @xmath19}{1/4+\\nu^2}. \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    the label @xmath20 for each of the moments is the conformal spin .",
    "the functions @xmath21 in the definition of the coefficients @xmath22 are the building blocks of the nll bfkl kernel @xcite . a similar formula for @xmath22 holds in the supersymmetric case with @xmath23 and @xmath24 replaced by the corresponding t hooft coupling @xmath25 , see @xcite for details .",
    "different observables can be built out of the coefficients @xmath22 .",
    "the total ( averaged over @xmath26 ) cross - section is @xmath27 , while contributions of higher conformal spins are projected in the moments @xmath28 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath18 cancels when constructing the ratios @xmath29 .",
    "these ratios @xmath30 have a good perturbative convergence , and are clean observables to test the properties of the regge limit , in particular conformal invariance , without interference of collinear contributions .",
    "they were computed in @xcite in qcd and @xmath0 sym for different renormalisation prescriptions .",
    "the results found in @xcite are summarised in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "@xmath0 results are showed in a yellow band since the non - running coupling was allowed to take values in a given range .",
    "one can see that the predictions of the two theories for @xmath30 lie very close , in particular when choosing the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) procedure @xcite .",
    "the blm procedure effectively resums the effects of a non - zero @xmath31-function and has a conformal behaviour like the one exhibited by @xmath0 theory . in @xcite",
    "it was shown to give a more sensible result than @xmath32 scheme for the pomeron intercept .",
    "the appearance of an unnaturally high blm scale for the coupling in this case is relaxed when studying observables insensitive to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that only when considering clean and perturbatively convergent observables for the high - energy limit , the blm prescription is systematically closer than the other renormalization schemes to the supersymmetric result .",
