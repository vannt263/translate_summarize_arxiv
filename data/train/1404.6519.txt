    "compendia of mathematical formulae have a long and rich history .",
    "many scientists have developed such repositories as books and these have been extremely useful to scientists , mathematicians and engineers over the last several centuries ( see @xcite for instance ) .",
    "while there may be some overlap of formulae in different compendia , one often needs to be familiar with many different compendia to find a specific desired formula .",
    "online compendia of mathematical formulae exist , such as the http://dlmf.nist.gov[nist digital library of mathematical functions ] ( dlmf ) , subsets of http://en.wikipedia.org[wikipedia ] , and the http://functions.wolfram.com[wolfram functions site ] .",
    "we hope to take advantage of the best aspects of these online efforts while also incorporating powerful new features that a community - arm of scientists should find beneficial .",
    "our strategy is to start with validated and trustworthy special function data from the nist dlmf , while adding web 2.0 capabilities which will encourage community members to discuss mathematical data associated with formulae .",
    "these discussions will include internally hyperlinked proofs as well as mathematical connections between formulae in the repository .",
    "the online repository will be designed for a mathematically literate audience and should ( 1 ) facilitate interaction among a community of mathematicians and scientists interested in formulae data related to orthogonal polynomials and special functions ( opsf ) ; ( 2 ) be expandable , allowing the input of new formulae ; ( 3 ) be accessible as a standalone resource ; ( 4 ) have a user friendly , consistent , and hyperlinkable viewpoint and authoring perspective ; and ( 5 ) contain easily searchable mathematics and take advantage of modern mathml tools for easy to read , scalably rendered mathematics .",
    "it is the desire of our group to build a tool that brings the above features together in a public website for mathematicians , scientists and engineers .",
    "we refer to this web tool as the digital repository of mathematical formulae ( http://drmf.mathweb.org[drmf ] ) .",
    "our project was motivated by the goal of creating an interactive online compendium of mathematical formulae .",
    "this need was was addressed in https://www.siam.org[siam ] activity group opsf - net discussions , such as http://math.nist.gov/~dlozier/opsfnet/opsf-net_18.4.pdf[dmitry karp ( opsf - net 18.4 , topic # 5 ) ] . in that opsf - net edition , there were two related posts http://math.nist.gov/~dlozier/opsfnet/opsf-net_18.4.pdf[(opsf-net 18.4 , topics # 6,#7 ) ] with a follow - up post in http://math.nist.gov/~dlozier/opsfnet/opsf-net_18.6.pdf[opsf-net 18.6 , topic # 3 ] .",
    "in our project , we have taken advantage of the free and open source http://www.mediawiki.org[mediawiki ] wiki software as well as tools developed within the http://dlmf.nist.gov[dlmf project ] @xcite , such as latexml and the dlmf latexmacros .",
    "dlmf macros ( and extensions as necessary ) tie specific character sequences to unique mathematical objects such as special functions , orthogonal polynomials , or to other mathematical symbols associated with these .",
    "the dlmf macros are hence used to define opsf within drmf and through latexml , their corresponding rendered mathematical symbols .",
    "furthermore , the use of dlmf macros as linked to their definitions within the dlmf , allows for easy access to precise opsf definitions for the symbols used within the latexsource for opsf formulae . the committed use of dlmf macros guarantees a mathematical and structural consistency throughout the drmf .",
    "as a web tool , the drmf provides ( 1 ) formula interactivity , ( 2 ) formula home pages , ( 3 ) centralized bibliography , and ( 4 ) mathematical search .",
    "the drmf shares the core dlmf component , http://dlmf.nist.gov/latexml[latexml ] , which ( through the math extension ) processes wikitext math markup written in latexto produce xml and html . for formula interactivity and menus linked to formulae",
    ", we have utilized the https://github.com/kwarc/jobad[jobad interactivity framework ] and are investigating the use of mathjax @xcite .",
    "we have also incorporated the http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/extension:math [ :  math ] and mathsearch @xcite extensions . within the drmf",
    ", we will develop technology for users to interact with formulae using a clipboard , which allows for easy copy / paste of formula source representations ( to include latexwith dlmf macros ; presentation or content mathml ; as well as input formats for computer algebra systems such as http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/[mathematica ] , http://www.maplesoft.com[maple ] , and http://www.sagemath.org[sage ] ) .",
    "the drmf treats formulae as first class objects , describing them in formula home pages that currently contain : ( 1 ) a rendered description of the formula itself ( required ) ; ( 2 ) bibliographic citation ( required ) ; ( 3 ) open section for proofs ( required ) ; ( 4 ) list of symbols used and links to their definitions corresponding to the dlmf macros ( required ) ; ( 5 ) open section for notes relevant to the formula ( e.g. , formula name , if the formula is a generalization or specialization of some other formula , growth or decay conditions , links to errata pages , etc . )",
    "; ( 6 ) open section for external links ; ( 7 ) substitutions with definitions required to understand the formula ; and ( 8) constraints the formula must obey . for each formula",
    "home page there is a corresponding talk page , and we are incorporating a strategy for handling the insertion of formula errata . a major resource in our ability to implement effective and precise opsf search will be the use of the dlmf macros in building the latexsource for opsf formulae and related mathematical data .",
    "+ next , we present an overview of the seed resources , which we plan to incorporate within drmf .",
    "we have been given permission and are seeding the drmf with data from the nist dlmf @xcite .",
    "we have also been given permission to and are seeding latexformulae data from @xcite ( kls ) .",
    "we will also incorporate tom koornwinder s companion of recent arxiv published additions to kls @xcite .",
    "we have also been given permission to incorporate seed formula data from @xcite ( bmp ) .",
    "efforts to upload bmp data , as well as any book data without existing latexsource , will prove extremely difficult , since this effort will rely on the use of mathematical optical character recognition ( ocr ) software such as http://www.inftyreader.org[inftyreader ] to produce latexsource for these formulae .",
    "mathematical ocr is still in its nascence and this effort is currently under consideration for feasibility of use .",
    "we are in communication with other authors and publishers to gain access and permission for other proven sources of mathematical opsf formulae such as @xcite and we are are excited about the prospect of seeding proof data by victor moll and collaborators ( see for instance @xcite ) . for latex  source where dlmf macros are not present ( such as kls )",
    ", we are developing tools which automate dlmf macro replacements . seeding and generating symbol lists",
    "are accomplished by converting latex  source into wikitext , in an automated fashion .",
    "we use pywikibot to automate the uploading of wikitext pages to our demo site .",
    "* acknowledgements *   + we are deeply indebted to deyan ginev for sharing with us his expansive vision and especially for his support in the development of our proof of concept . without his guidance and coding , our present demonstration would not be possible .",
    "we would also like to thank bruce miller at nist for his invaluable contributions regarding latexml .",
    "we would also like to express our deep gratitude to the kwarc group at jacobs university , bremen , germany , and especially to its group leader , michael kohlhase , for his advice and for access to his group s mathweb server for our initial drmf development .",
    "we would also like to thank dan lozier , tom koornwinder , dmitry karp , dan zwillinger , victor moll , and hans volkmer for offering their advice and for valuable discussions .",
