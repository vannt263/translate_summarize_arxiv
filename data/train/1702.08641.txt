    "popular statistical multi - object tracking techniques include multiple - hypotheses tracking ( mht )  @xcite , joint probabilistic data association ( jpda )  @xcite , and random finite set ( rfs ) filters  @xcite .",
    "recent studies on rfs theory have led to various filters with different implementations ( based on simplifying but reasonable assumptions on the multi - object distribution ) such as probability hypothesis density ( phd ) filter and its cardinalized version ( cphd )  @xcite , the multi - bernoulli filter ( mb ) and its cardinality - balanced version ( cb - member )  @xcite , and the newly derived @xmath0-glmb(generalized labeled multi - bernoulli )  @xcite and its special case , the labeled multi - bernoulli ( lmb ) filters  @xcite . a robust version of multi - bernoulli filter that can handle unknown clutter intensity and detection profile has also been introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the most recent family of rfs filters are based on using _ labeled random finite set _ densities which have been shown to admit conjugacy with the general multiple point measurement set likelihood and to be closed under the chapman - kolmogorov equation  @xcite .",
    "various implementations of rfs filters based on sequential monte carlo ( smc ) and gaussian - mixture approximations have been presented .",
    "these methods have been utilized to solve different tracking problems in various applications such as track - before - detect visual tracking applications  @xcite , and sensor management in target tracking applications  @xcite .    in multi - sensor applications ,",
    "a common approach is to use the above filters in each sensor node and fuse the posterior densities that computed locally in every node with each other .",
    "the fusion operation can be executed in a distributed or central manner . in this context",
    ", multi - sensor fusion refers to combining several multi - object posteriors that depending on the type of the filter used in each sensor node , can have a different mathematical form . to combine the local posteriors ,",
    "the most common method proposed in the rfs filtering literature is using the generalized covariance intersection ( gci ) rule .",

    "the multi - sensor fusion rules that have been formulated based on the gci - rule in  @xcite all lead to _ consensus fusion _",

    ", some objects may not be detected by _ all _ sensors . in a consensus",

    "the proposed sensor fusion method is fundamentally different from the gci - rule as used in  @xcite , in the sense that it performs not only consensus fusion ( thus , enhanced accuracy when sensors are in agreement on the same object ) , but also complementary fusion ( thus , extended coverage when different sensors cover different regions ) .",
    "our method is particularly useful for fusion of lmb posteriors , with which the gci - rule leads to separately combining the densities of bernoulli components ( possible objects ) with the same label .",
    "we give adaptive weights to each bernoulli component label , so that _ the more informative _ local posteriors for that label influence the fused density more .",
    "the information content of each local posterior can be quantified using information theoretic divergence .    in a bayes filtering context , divergence functionals",
    "are commonly used to quantify the expected information gain from prior to posterior densities .",
    "the commonly used divergence functions in the stochastic filtering literature include the shannon entropy  @xcite , the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence  @xcite , and rnyi divergence  @xcite which has been the dominant choice of divergence in the random set filtering literature .",
    "these divergences have significant computational cost and can only be computed analytically for simple cases .",
    "recently , cauchy - schwarz divergence was shown to admit a simple closed - form expression for poisson multi - object densities  @xcite .",
    "this was followed by an increasing uptake of cauchy - schwarz divergence to solve multi - object tracking problems using labeled random set filters  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use cauchy - schwarz divergence to quantify the information content of each local posterior in relation to each possibly existing object ( bernoulli component of the fused lmb posterior ) .    the major contributions of this paper include :    1 .",
    "a complete framework is proposed for statistical multi - sensor fusion in multi - object systems , formulated for lmb filters running locally in each sensor node of the system .",
    "the solution can handle both consensus ( competitive ) fusion of sensors that detect the same object , and complementary fusion of sensors with limited field of view that cover different parts of the object state space , or a mix of competitive and complementary fusion in cases where the sensors fields of view overlap and objects can be detected by more than one sensor .",
    "2 .   formulation of cauchy schwarz divergence from prior to posterior is presented for each component of an lmb density , in addition to its incorporation into the fusion formula .",
    "detailed sequential monte carlo ( smc ) implementation of the entire framework using lmb filters is presented via a step - by - step algorithm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : back ] briefly reviews the necessary background material on labeled multi - bernoulli filter and cauchy - schwarz divergence . the proposed multi - sensor fusion method and its full implementation are then presented in section  [ sec : approach ] .",
    "numerical experiments are given in section  [ sec : sim_res ] .",
    "they demonstrate that in scenarios involving sensors with unlimited fields of view ( hence all objects being detectable , and consensus fusion being suitable ) , our method performs very similar to the gci - rule .",

    "a bandwidth of @xmath193 means unlimited sensors field of view .",
    "hence , all sensors should have consensus on detecting an existing target , and the gci fusion method ( which is consensus - based ) should work .",

    "the following observations can be made from the results presented in figures  [ fig : different_width ] and  [ fig : card_different_width ] :    * when the sensors have unlimited field of view ( @xmath193 ) , our method and the state of art gci fusion method  @xcite perform similarly .",
    "but our method returns slightly lower estimation errors , because within its sensor fusion scheme , it prioritizes sensor measurements that convey more information .",
    "* when the field of view is limited ( e.g. @xmath195 in our experiments ) , the gci fusion method  @xcite fails to detect some targets ( it returns cardinality estimates that are far below the ground truth in figure  [ fig : card_different_width ] ) and consequently returns large ospa errors  see figure  [ fig : different_width ] .",
    "this is while with the same limited field of view , our method returns acceptable cardinality estimates ( detecting all targets in most of the 200 monte carlo runs ) and small ospa errors . *",
    "the performance of our proposed method ( in terms of detection - cardinality - and overall ospa errors ) is robust to variations in the field of view .",
    "there is not much difference in data plotted for our method in figures  [ fig : different_width ] and  [ fig : card_different_width ] for different @xmath196 values .",

    "a novel multiple - view multi - sensor fusion method was introduced for lmb filters . through the cauchy - schwarz divergence evaluation for each lmb component on all sensors ,",
    "the proposed method overcomes the drawbacks of commonly used generalized covariance intersection ( gci ) method , which only considers a constant weight to each sensor during the whole tracking and fusion process . with a proper sensor importance weights selection scheme , a step - by - step smc fusion implementation algorithm was detailed with lmb filters running on each sensor node .",
