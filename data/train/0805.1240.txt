    "let @xmath4 denote the associated contact structure , and let @xmath5 .",
    "the embedded contact homology @xmath6 is the homology of a chain complex which is generated by finite sets of pairs @xmath7 , where the @xmath8 s are distinct embedded reeb orbits , the @xmath9 s are positive integers , @xmath10=\\gamma \\in h_1(y)$ ] , and @xmath11 whenever @xmath8 is hyperbolic .",
    "the differential @xmath12 on the chain complex counts certain ( mostly ) embedded holomorphic curves in @xmath13 , with respect to a suitable @xmath14-invariant almost complex structure @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , the differential counts holomorphic curves @xmath16 whose ech index equals one . the ech index @xmath17 , originally defined in @xcite and reviewed here in ",
    "[ sec : i ] , is a certain topological quantity which depends only on the relative homology class of @xmath16 .",
    "the relation between the condition @xmath18 and embeddedness is as follows .",
    "it is shown . ] in @xcite that if @xmath16 is not multiply covered , then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a nonnegative integer which equals zero if and only if @xmath16 is embedded .",
    "here @xmath21 denotes the fredholm index of @xmath16 , which is the dimension of the moduli space of holomorphic curves near @xmath16 if @xmath15 is generic .",
    "it is further shown in @xcite that if @xmath22 is a union of @xmath14-invariant cylinders , and if the image of @xmath16 contains no @xmath14-invariant cylinder , then @xmath23 where ` @xmath24 ' denotes the algebraic intersection number , which is nonnegative by intersection positivity . the inequalities and imply , as explained in (",
    "11.5 ) , that if @xmath15 is generic , then any holomorphic curve @xmath16 with @xmath18 consists of an embedded component of fredholm index one , possibly together with some covers of @xmath14-invariant cylinders which do not intersect the rest of @xmath16 .",
    "these are the curves that the ech differential counts .",
    "in particular , @xmath25 defines the relative grading on the chain complex .",
    "see @xcite for more about ech , and @xcite for a proof that @xmath26 .",
    "a priori , ech might depend not only on @xmath0 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , but also on the choice of contact form @xmath3 and almost complex structure @xmath15 .",
    "however , taubes @xcite has recently shown that , as conjectured in @xcite , ech is not only independent of @xmath3 and @xmath15 , but also isomorphic to a version of seiberg - witten floer homology as defined by kronheimer - mrowka @xcite .",
    "the precise statement is that .",
    "this is also isomorphic to the completed version @xmath29 , and conjecturally isomorphic to the heegaard floer homology @xmath30 . ]",
    "@xmath31 up to a grading shift , where @xmath32 is a spin - c structure determined by @xmath27 , see  [ sec : tp ] .",
    "thus ech is more or less a topological invariant of the three - manifold @xmath0 , and in this regard it differs substantially from the symplectic field theory of eliashberg - givental - hofer @xcite , which is highly sensitive to the contact structure and vanishes for overtwisted ones @xcite .",
    "the isomorphism can be regarded as an extension of taubes s `` seiberg - witten = gromov '' theorem for closed symplectic 4-manifolds @xcite to the noncompact symplectic 4-manifold @xmath13 .",
    "this hoped - for correspondence was the original motivation for the definition of ech , see @xcite .      despite this motivation ,",
    "the definition of ech , and especially the ech index , may at first seem a bit strange .",
    "the aim of this paper is to shed some additional light on the ech index by proving four new results about it .",
    "first , in  [ sec : ag ] we show that the relative grading on ech can be refined to an absolute grading , which associates to each generator a homotopy class of oriented 2-plane fields on @xmath0 , see theorem  [ thm : ag ] . if @xmath7 is an ech generator , then the associated 2-plane field @xmath33 is obtained by modifying the contact plane field @xmath27 in a canonical manner ( up to homotopy , depending only on @xmath9 ) in disjoint tubular neighborhoods of the reeb orbits @xmath8 .",
    "recall from @xcite that seiberg - witten floer homology also has an absolute grading by homotopy classes of oriented 2-plane fields .",
    "we conjecture that taubes s isomorphism between ech and seiberg - witten floer homology respects these absolute gradings .",
    "we also expect that one can define a similar absolute grading on heegaard floer homology , by refining the construction in @xcite that associates to each heegaard - floer generator a spin - c structure .",
    "second , in ",
    "[ sec : iicob ] we generalize the index inequality to holomorphic curves in four - dimensional symplectic cobordisms , see theorem  [ thm : indi ] .",
    "our proof follows the original proof of , but with a new and simpler proof of the key combinatorial lemma .",
    "third , in  [ sec : iu ] we prove a new inequality on the ech index of unions and multiple covers of holomorphic curves in cobordisms , see theorem  [ thm : iu ] .",
    "this inequality is a substantial generalization of and asserts that if @xmath16 and @xmath34 are two holomorphic curves , then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an `` intersection number '' of @xmath16 and @xmath34 defined in ",
    "[ sec : in ] .",
    "if the images of @xmath16 and @xmath34 do not have any irreducible components in common , then @xmath36 is simply the algebraic count of intersections of @xmath16 and @xmath34 , which is nonnegative by intersection positivity .",
    "if the images of @xmath16 and @xmath34 have a common component , then the definition of @xmath36 is more subtle . in particular , @xmath37 can be negative .",
    "ultimately , when @xmath38 is a symplectic cobordism from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , one would like to define a map from the ech of @xmath39 to that of @xmath40 by counting holomorphic curves @xmath16 in @xmath38 with ech index @xmath41 .",
    "a major difficulty is that even if @xmath15 is generic , an arbitrary @xmath42 curve may contain some negative ech index multiple covers , together with some other components with positive fredholm index .",
    "the inequality clarifies the extent to which this can happen .",
    "note that this problem does not arise in defining the ech differential . indeed , if @xmath38 is a symplectization @xmath13 with an @xmath14-invariant almost complex structure , then with some trivial exceptions @xmath43 is always nonnegative , see proposition  [ prop : cdotc ] .",
    "while the ech differential counts holomorphic curves @xmath16 with @xmath18 , the latter condition does not specify the genus or euler characteristic of @xmath16 . to complete the picture here",
    ", the last part of this paper introduces another relative index , which we denote by @xmath44 .",
    "this is a natural cousin of the ech index @xmath25 , and has similar basic properties .",
    "an analogue of the inequality holds for @xmath44 , in which @xmath44 bounds the negative euler characteristic instead of the fredholm index , see corollary  [ cor : eulerbound ] and the stronger proposition  [ prop : jbound ] . a version of the inequality also holds for @xmath44 , see proposition  [ prop : ju ] .",
    "the resulting bound on the topological complexity of holomorphic curves in terms of @xmath44 plays a key role in a subsequent paper @xcite , which obtains various extensions of the weinstein conjecture .",
    "the above inequalities also lead to the last main result of the present paper , theorem  [ thm : j+ ] , asserting that if @xmath38 is the symplectization of a contact manifold @xmath0 with an @xmath14-invariant almost complex structure , then every holomorphic curve @xmath16 in @xmath38 satisfies @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is another relative index which is a slight variant of @xmath44 .",
    "it follows that @xmath46 defines a relative filtration on embedded contact homology , or for that matter on any kind of contact homology of a contact 3-manifold . as explained in ",
    "[ sec : jdiscussion ] , this filtration is a useful computational tool , although it does not give new topological invariants except possibly in special situations .      embedded contact homology is very similar to the periodic floer homology ( pfh ) of mapping tori considered in @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a more general geometric structure from @xcite , called a `` stable hamiltonian structure '' , which includes both contact manifolds and mapping tori as special cases , and for which one still has gromov - type compactness for holomorphic curves .",
    "the definition of ech or pfh then extends in a straightforward way to any 3-manifold with a stable hamiltonian structure in which all reeb orbits are nondegenerate . for this reason",
    ", we will use stable hamiltonian structures as the basic geometric setup throughout this paper .",
    "we now review the definition of the ech index , and the various notions that enter into it , in the context of stable hamiltonian structures .",
    "let @xmath0 be an oriented @xmath47-manifold . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is closed , although for most of this paper this is not actually necessary .",
