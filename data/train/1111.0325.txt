    "observations of pulsars by the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ large area telescope ( lat )  @xcite have shown that the high - energy emission likely originates in the outer magnetosphere  @xcite .",
    "we simulated high - energy light curves from geometrical versions of two standard high - altitude emission models , the outer gap ( og )  @xcite and slot gap ( sg )  @xcite , and from a third , modified sg model with azimuthal asymmetry in emissivity due to a naturally occurring offset dipole ( asg )  @xcite .",
    "these models were considered within two field geometries , the vacuum retarded dipole ( vrd ) and force - free ( ff )  @xcite fields .",
    "we compared the resulting light curves with the lat light curves of the vela pulsar and psr j0007 + 7303 , the cta 1 pulsar , to constrain the systems geometries , and calculated the model - dependent magnitude of the accelerating electric field @xmath0 in the vrd field .",
    "to model the lat light curves , we first simulated pulsar light curves from geometrical representations of the sg , asg , and og emission zones within the vrd and ff fields , following the simulation method of  @xcite . the @xmath1 field defined in the observer s frame is transformed to the co - rotating frame ( cf )  @xcite and photons are emitted tangent to * b * in the cf prior to calculation of the aberration .",
    "we assume constant emissivity along the field lines in the cf .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetry in the polar cap ( pc ) angle for the asg model is calculated for each inclination angle @xmath2 as in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . for a given @xmath2 , gap width @xmath3 ( in units of open volume",

    "the emission in the off - peak above the background level was assumed to be magnetospheric in origin ( but see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the vela background was found to be 204 counts / bin using the off - peak ( phases 0.8 - 1 , where no magnetospheric emission was detected in our spectral fits ) counts in the energy - dependent psf of the pulsar .",
    "we used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) maximum likelihood routine  @xcite to search the parameter space for the combination of ( @xmath2 , @xmath12 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath25 ) that best reproduced the lat light curves .",

    ", we subtracted the background level from the lat light curve , re - binned the model to match the data , and normalized the model to the total counts in the lat light curve . for each fit in the vacuum case , we ran 200 chains with 20 steps each to adequately sample the parameter space . for",

    "we have plotted @xmath0 and @xmath53 with minimum emission radius for the og and sg models in figure  [ eparallel ] .",
    "for both emission models , vela has overall a @xmath54constant or gradually varying @xmath0 with altitude ( panel @xmath55 of figure  [ eparallel ] ) , which is expected ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in panel @xmath56 ,",
    "the value of @xmath0 is compared with @xmath57 . as expected for an @xmath58 field induced by @xmath1 , the ratio @xmath59 for all @xmath8 out to the light cylinder radius ( near and beyond @xmath60 , the vector components of * b * are less certain and",
    "are not included in this calculation ) .    for psr j0007",
    "+ 7303 , the magnitude of @xmath0 with @xmath8 is consistent with a constant ( panel @xmath61 ) , and its values are similar to those calculated for vela .",
    "note that the geometrical parameters obtained from the light curve fits are very different from those of vela , leading to a different range of @xmath8 for psr j0007 + 7303 .",
    "the ratio @xmath59 for the best fit sg model , but it is @xmath62 for the best fit parameters of the og model .",
    "there are instances in , for example , a non - ideal magnetosphere  @xcite where @xmath0 may be @xmath63 . in the case of the vacuum field ,",
    "in which there are no currents , the only source of @xmath0 is induction by @xmath1 , and therefore @xmath0 can not be larger than @xmath11 . in this particular case , then , we find that the combination of the og model and vrd field we have used does not approximate the physical environment of the pulsar magnetosphere and/or the geometry of the emission zone .",
    "we have evaluated the geometries of the slot gap and outer gap emission models , and the vacuum retarded dipole and force - free magnetic field solutions , by comparing the simulated light curves with the lat light curves of vela and psr j0007 + 7303 and finding the geometrical model parameters that best reproduce the data in each case . in general",
    ", the og has no off - peak emission ( this is largely responsible for the og fitting vela the best and psr j0007 + 7303 the worst ) , while the sg models do a better job of reproducing wing emission but over - predict the off - peak emission . introducing azimuthal asymmetry of the pc angle in the asg model leads to a reduction in the off - peak emission level , improving upon the sg model light curve fits within the vrd field . in the ff field , however , asg light curves tend to have a much reduced first peak , leading to significantly worse light curve fits .",
    "the first @xmath33-ray peak occurs at later phase in ff light curves , so values of @xmath25 are larger in the ff magnetosphere than in the vrd field .",
    "physically , @xmath25 can not be larger than the phase lag between the radio and first @xmath33-ray peak unless the radio beam model is highly contrived .",
    "the ff field requires a @xmath64 larger than this phase lag for vela .",
    "this suggests that the true pulsar magnetosphere may be significantly different from the ff magnetosphere .    for vela ,",
    "all fits within the vrd field have @xmath12 close to the expected value of @xmath65 , and all have reasonable values of @xmath34 such that the radio emission is observable .",
    "interestingly , the asg model has @xmath12 closest to @xmath65 , and while its @xmath31 is poor , it is an improvement over the sg and qualitatively reproduces well the major features ( two main peaks and inner peak ) of the pulsed emission .",
    "the ff fits also get close to the correct @xmath12 value , but only the og has an acceptable @xmath66 , while the best fit sg models are consistent with a radio - quiet pulsar .",
    "both field structures lead to large @xmath66 for psr j0007 + 7303 , consistent with the lack of detected radio emission .",
    "we calculated the model - dependent @xmath0 for the og and sg geometries , and found that it is constant or slowly varying with emission radius .",
    "comparing @xmath0 with @xmath11 leads to the interesting result that for psr j0007 + 7303 , @xmath67 , and thus disfavors the og model in the vrd geometry at the location in parameter space where the best light curve fit is found .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 can therefore be used as a diagnostic of the model magnetosphere and emission geometry , in addition to the light curve fitting .",
    "we can not rule in favor of the sg or og from these light curve fits . as the models are purely geometrical , we expect to reproduce only dominant light curve features , and our statistical fits are poor .",
    "the vacuum field produces better light curve fits than the force - free field .",
    "however , we note that the resolution in @xmath2 of our ff models is much lower than in the vrd , so further modeling with higher resolution is needed to confirm this result .",
    "we have demonstrated that light curve modeling leads to constraints on the geometry of individual systems , and that the phase lag is an important diagnostic in comparing magnetic field structures .",
    "the model - dependent calculation of @xmath0 , and comparison with the model @xmath11 , can additionally be used to constrain both the magnetosphere and emission geometry ."
