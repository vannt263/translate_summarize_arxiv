    "the formation , stability and dynamics of vortex - like structures has been a long - standing theme of interest in many areas of physics , including classical fluid mechanics @xcite , superfluidity and superconductivity @xcite , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the past decade , there has been a tremendous growth of excitement in this topic in the branches of atomic and optical physics .",
    "this has been propelled by considerable experimental and theoretical advances in the fields of nonlinear optics @xcite and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in dilute alkali vapors @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "focusing more specifically on the rapidly growing area of becs @xcite , one can recognize that the study of vortices has been central to the relevant literature .",
    "in particular , as concerns the experimental efforts , the original observations of single @xcite and multiple vortices @xcite was soon followed by the realization of robust lattices of large numbers of vortices @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies turned to higher - charged structures such as vortices of topological charge @xmath0 and even @xmath1 @xcite and illustrating dynamical instability of these topological objects @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the abundance of experimental results has stirred an intense theoretical interest in the conditions under which such vortices and vortex lattices would be robust and experimentally observable .",
    "most often , vortex existence and stability issues were examined in the framework of the standard parabolic confining potential ( typically produced by magnetic traps ) . in that framework , and in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , vortices of charge @xmath2 were found to be stable , while vortices of higher charge ( @xmath3 ) were shown to be potentially unstable @xcite ( depending on the atom numbers ) .",
    "later , similar results were found for vortices of @xmath1 @xcite , while the availability of more substantial computational resources has more recently led to similar conclusions in the fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) case @xcite .",
    "the studies of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite examined the various scenarios of break - up of higher - charge vortices during dynamical evolution simulations for repulsive and attractive interactions respectively .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "@xcite considered such vortices riding on the background of not just the ground state , but also of higher , ring - like , excited states of the system .",
    "it should also be mentioned that these advancements have motivated the development of mathematically rigorous tools in order to study the spectrum of such vortex modes .",
    "such methods involve the use of the evans function @xcite , or the use of the index theorem evaluating the number of potentially unstable eigendirections @xcite .",
    "although the existence and stability of fundamental and higher charge vortices has been examined extensively as indicated above , the _ formation _ of such vortex structures is far less studied . in particular , while seminal interference experiments ( demonstrating that becs are coherent matter waves ) were reported as early as a decade ago @xcite , the role of interference between becs in vortex generation was experimentally studied only recently @xcite .",
    "this work proposed and examined the formation of vortices resulting from the interference and controlled merging of three condensed fragments , where the fragments were essentially independent becs separated by an optical potential barrier .",
    "such a process has close ties to elements of topological defect formation in phase transitions , as proposed by kibble @xcite and zurek @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the experimental work was almost concurrent with a theoretical study investigating a simpler elongated barrier separating two independent becs @xcite ; in the latter setting , the interference forms a dark soliton whose bending and subsequent breakup due to the manifestation of the transverse modulational instability also result in vortices .    in the present work ,",
    "we expand on these considerations and study in detail , by means of systematic numerical simulations , the formation of vortices in a setting closely matching the one of the experiment in ref .",
    "our purpose is to get a deeper insight into this interference - induced vortex formation mechanism , investigating fundamental features , such as the number and lifetime of ensuing vortices .",
    "this is done upon studying in detail the parametric dependences influencing the relevant experimental observations .",
    "specifically , we quantify the above mentioned features as functions of the elimination / ramping - down time of the optical barrier between the fragments , or the initial relative phases between the original independent fragments .",
    "our investigation chiefly refers to a 2d setting , but we also illustrate how the results are generalized in the pertinent 3d case . notice that our considerations are motivated not only by their direct bearing on the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , but also by their relevance to studies of spontaneous symmetry breaking during phase transitions @xcite .",

    "it is also possible to observe some vorticity in the bulk of the cloud that does not directly come from the phase differences between the initial fragments , but from the actual turbulence that is created by the fragment collision . as an example ,",
    "two small vortex rings are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ 3da ] for @xmath72 ms ( one close to the top of the cloud and the other one 1/3 from the bottom ) .",
    "we would like to stress the difficulty of capturing the vorticity at the edge of the cloud ( where most vorticity is actually observed ) in our numerical experiments .",
    "this is due to the fact that the vorticity is defined as the curl of the fluid velocity of eq .",
    "( [ fluid_vel ] ) that is normalized by the density .",
    "the numerical effect is that close to the periphery ( where the density is small ) the fluid velocity corresponds to the ratio of small numbers which imposes great numerical difficulties .",
    "nonetheless , by using a fine grid of @xmath73 we are able to capture most of the delicate vorticity dynamics at the periphery of the cloud consisting , mostly , of horizontal vortex lines that are parallel to the periphery of the cloud .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is the oscillation of the atomic cloud .",
    "the cloud starts with a larger horizontal extent compared to the vertical one and after merger creates an almost spherical cloud , which in turn elongates again in the horizontal direction after the fragments go `` through '' each other .",
    "this behavior repeats a few times until the cloud takes an approximate spherical shape ( results not shown here ) .",
    "we have also monitored the effects of damping due to the coupling of the condensed atoms to the thermal cloud .",
    "equation  ( [ gpe ] ) is obtained by supposing a dilute bose gas at a temperature close to _ absolute zero_. however , at finite temperatures , but still smaller than the critical temperature @xmath74 for condensation , a fraction of the atoms are not condensed and form the so - called thermal cloud . in turn",
    ", this thermal cloud induces a damping on the dynamics of the condensed cloud .",
    "we used the approach of phenomenological damping @xcite described in refs .",
    "@xcite that relies on replacing the @xmath75 in front of the time derivative in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the damping rate , and by renormalizing the solution at each iteration to keep the initial mass ( number of atoms ) constant during integration .",
    "we tested values of @xmath77 in the interval @xmath78 $ ] that contains the value of 0.03 estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite for a temperature @xmath79 .",
    "the results of the phenomenological damping are , qualitatively , very similar ( results not shown here ) to the effects of ramping down the barrier over longer time scales : larger damping resulting in a stronger suppression of the vorticity generated by the merger of the different cloud fragments .",
    "the simulations described in the present work were directly aimed at developing a more thorough understanding of both the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite and the dynamics of vortex formation during bec merging and collisions . in this section ,",
    "we thus briefly discuss the observed similarities and differences between the experimental and theoretical results .    in the laboratory experiment ,",
    "an optical potential was used to segment a harmonic trap before condensation was achieved ; with additional evaporative cooling , three initially isolated and mutually independent ( i.e. , uncorrelated phases between the different fragments ) condensates were created . a phase - contrast image of three such becs is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_expt](a ) , which can be directly compared with the simulated data of fig .",
    "[ 3da ] ( bottom row , left image ) .",
    "the initial condition of incoherent condensate fragments serves as the conceptual basis behind the motivation to impose and examine various relative phases between the fragments in this work s simulations . in the experiment ,",
    "the optical barrier was ramped off approximately linearly over time scales between 50 ms and 3 s , significantly longer than the time scales considered in the simulations . at the end of the merging process ,",
    "immediately after the barrier was completely removed , the fully merged bec was released from the harmonic trap and allowed to ballistically expand for 56 ms to enable imaging of vortex cores .",
    "example images of merged and expanded becs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_expt](b ) through ( d ) .",
    "these images can be compared with the simulated data of figs .",
    "[ 3da ] through [ 3dc ] ( bottom rows ) ; note that the simulations do not involve an expansion stage .        -0.4 cm    in both experimental results and in the simulations shown here , we note the following important similarities .",
    "first , it is clear that vortex cores may be formed during the merging process .",
    "second , as noted in the experimental work , the vortex formation process should depend upon relative phases between the condensates .",
    "this conclusion is borne out by the present work .",
    "specifically , the simple analysis of a slow merging process leading to a 25% probability of vortex formation , as presented in the experimental work , matches the results of the simulations summarized in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "finally , experimental and simulated results show that faster merging leads to more vortices initially created , but these vortices may self - annihilate with time by holding the fully merged bec in the trap .",
    "however , there is one notable quantitative difference between the experimental and numerical results . in the experimental work , for barrier",
    "ramp - down times longer than 1 s , single vortices were experimentally observed in approximately 25% of the images obtained directly at the conclusion of the merging process .",
    "multiple vortex cores were not observed under these conditions . for faster ramps , experimental images containing either single or multiple cores",
    "were more often obtained , with significantly more than 25% of the images containing at least one vortex core .",
    "the results of the numerical data show that the slow merging limit ( where multiple vortices cease to be created during merging ) is reached for merging times that are much shorter than in the experiment . in other words ,",
    "images with multiple vortices are seen in the experiment under conditions where the numerical results would suggest that a given bec should have at most one vortex .",
    "there are a few possible sources of this discrepancy . at first glance",
    ", it might appear that the spontaneous formation of vortices in becs during evaporative cooling in an axi - symmetric _ harmonic _ trap , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , could play a role in higher percentage of vortices seen in the experiment .",
    "such vortex formation processes can not be described by the gpe and are thus not observable in the simulations of this work . however , due to angular momentum damping and self - annihilation of vortices in the asymmetric local potentials in which the three bec fragments grow , we believe that vortices that might be spontaneously created in one ( or more ) of the three becs are unlikely to survive at rates that would affect the experimental observations of ref .  @xcite .",
    "this possible source for the quantitative discrepancy could be tested , for example , with simulation methods based on the stochastic gpe @xcite .",
    "perhaps a more likely source of the quantitative discrepancy may lie in the optical potential energy or shape ; differences between the experiment and simulations regarding barrier heights , widths , and ramp - down trajectory might induce more vortices to form during merging .",
    "for example , if center - of - mass oscillations of the cloud were induced in the experiment , atomic fluid flow around the central portion of the optical barrier could induce formation of vortices and lead to increased vortex observation rates in the experiment .",
    "such processes could be studied in future gpe simulations in order to further characterize dynamical processes that may be involved in vortex formation",
    ". it might also be possible that imperfections in the true optical barrier used in the experiment could pin vortices for a portion of the barrier ramp process , and significantly alter the vortex formation and annihilation process . finally , much of the present work focused on the central portion of the trap , a region that encompasses the center of the merged bec . in the experimental work , however , vortices were most often seen further from the bec center .",
    "we have studied the formation and subsequent evolution of vortex structures and filaments in a system directly simulating the experimental setup of ref .",
    "in particular , we have considered the case of three independent fragments ( of variable initial relative phases ) and how these merge upon the ramping down and eventual removal of the optical barrier that separates them . while there are many similarities between the numerical results and the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the numerical simulations importantly show features and new dynamics not discussed or observed in the experimental work .",
    "the first part of our study concerns the simpler two - dimensional setting , where it is straightforward to observe the interference of the independent matter waves , the ensuing formation of vortices , as well as their motion within the cloud , as a function of different parameters such as the ramping - down time or the initial relative phases between the fragments .",
    "different diagnostics for the vorticity were developed in the process ( such as the @xmath54-component of the angular momentum , or the integrated velocity of the flow throughout the cloud or near its center ) and their dynamics was explained based on the evolution simulations .",
    "principal findings of this part of the work included the formation of smaller numbers of vortices as the ramping - down time was increased and the formation of a single vortex in the core of the condensate for appropriate , discrete - vortex - like relations between the phases of the different fragments .    the second part of our work explored how the features found in the two - dimensional setup are generalized in a fully three - dimensional setting , and how these affect the measurement process through , e.g. , the projection of the bec density on the plane .",
    "key features of the latter dynamical evolutions involved the blurring of the vortex dynamics by the projection process coupled with the spontaneous vortex bending even when the different fragments have the appropriate phase relation to generate a vortex through their merging . in the 3d setting ,",
    "the vorticity emerged in the form of vorticity sheets inducing vortex filaments ( most often in a horizontal form ) which led to pinching effects at the vortex cloud periphery and the formation of corresponding ridges in the atomic density profile .",
    "our work is related to a physical mechanism that has previously been discussed in the context of topological defect formation and trapping during phase transitions , often referred to as the kibble - zurek ( kz ) mechanism @xcite . for the case of cooling of an atomic gas through the bec phase transition @xcite , the kz scenario involves the growth and subsequent merging of phase - incoherent regions of the atomic cloud , with vortices being trapped in the merging process as the bec grows in size and atom number .",
    "the full kz mechanism involves physics beyond the scope of the simulations of this work ; however , our simulations show dynamical processes that may relate to the portion of the kz mechanism involving the merging of phase - incoherent regions of condensed atoms .",
    "our numerical results showing the phase relationships involved in vortex formation during merging are consistent with basic notions of this portion of the kz mechanism .",
    "there are many interesting questions to consider for future work in the present framework .",
    "firstly , it is clear that further analysis of experimental data and further variations of simulation parameters will be needed in order to resolve the quantitative differences between experimental and numerical results , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : expt ] .",
    "perhaps additional light on this question ( and an interesting diagnostic in its own right ) would be the examination of the integrated density along the @xmath80 plane which should perhaps detect some of the horizontal vorticity filaments illustrated herein .",
    "a particularly challenging ( and more general ) question along the same vein concerns the extent to which it may be possible to reconstruct the fully three - dimensional cloud density from such projections .    both from an experimental and from a theoretical point of view it would be interesting to extend the present considerations also to multi - component condensates in order to examine the potential formation of vortex - like filaments and structures in settings similar to the ones presented herein ( e.g. , containing fragments from different components ) . in the latter setting , there would exist an exciting interplay between the interference mechanisms and the formation of the coherent structures , and the phase separation dynamics between the components ; see e.g. , the recent experimental results of ref .",
