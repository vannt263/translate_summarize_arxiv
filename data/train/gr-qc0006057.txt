    "general relativity predicts that gravitational collapse of massive objects leads to space - time singularities in rather general circumstances in our universe@xcite and such singularities might be accompanied with the blow up of physical quantities ( energy density , pressure and curvature of space - time , etc ) . the known physical laws including general relativity itself will break down in the neighborhood of the space - time singularity and hence the quantum theory of gravity is believed to be necessary to describe the physical phenomena in such a region .",
    "one of the important issues is whether the space - time singularities formed in our universe are visible or not for the observer ( us ) far from the region where the gravitational collapse occurs .",
    "the cosmic censorship conjecture proposed by penrose gave a strong motivation to investigate this problem@xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , this conjecture states that the singularity is not visible for any observer if it is resulted from physically reasonable initial conditions .",
    "however , this conjecture has not yet been proven .",
    "rather candidates of the counterexample of this conjecture have been found .",
    "the simplest example is the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric dust fluid .",
    "there is an exact solution of einstein equations for this case ; the so - called lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution .",
    "after eardley and smarr have pointed out the occurrence of a central shell focusing naked singularity of marginally bound dust collapse@xcite , several theoretical efforts revealed the genericity of the shell focusing naked singularity formation in the ltb solution@xcite .",
    "there are several researches for more general spherically symmetric system and those revealed that non - vanishing pressure does not necessarily prevent the formation of the central shell focusing naked singularity@xcite .    on the other hand , there are not so much researches for non - spherical systems as the spherically symmetric cases since general analytic approach is impossible .",
    "nakamura et al .",
    "and nakamura and sato performed numerical simulations for axisymmetric perfect fluid system@xcite .",
    "their results suggest that naked singularities might be formed if the initial internal energy of the fluid elements is very small and initial configuration is sufficiently elongated .",
    "this result is consistent with the hoop conjecture proposed by thorne , which states that black holes with horizons form when and only when a mass @xmath3 gets compacted into a region whose circumference in every direction is @xmath4@xcite .",
    "shapiro and teukolsky also performed numerical simulations for the axisymmetric collision - less - particle system and showed a possibility of naked singularity formation which is also consistent with the hoop conjecture@xcite .",
    "the critical behavior of the axisymmetric gravitational waves is also a candidate of the naked singularity formation@xcite .",
    "an example which can be investigated analytically is the shell focusing naked singularity formation in the szekeres solution@xcite . anyway , even in the non - spherical cases , there are several examples of naked singularity formation .",
    "there might be readers who state that numerical examples can not be regarded as candidates of naked singularity formation since the numerical simulation can not reveal the global structure of the space - time and further can not deal with infinite quantities ( the numerical technique recently proposed by h@xmath5bner might be able to avoid this difficulty@xcite ) .",
    "however , the present authors would like to stress that if the region of sufficiently high energy , large pressure and large space - time curvature is visible from an observer far from the region , it should be regarded as a naked singularity .",
    "the region with extremely large physical quantities will be described by the quantum theory of gravity which is little known and hence such region is equivalent to a space - time singularity in practical sense .",
    "an important point of view for the naked singularity formation process has been proposed by nakamura et al.@xcite .",
    "they pointed out that the visible strong curvature region may be a candidate of strong gravitational wave sources .",
    "gravitational waves generated in such a region will propagate out from there since there is no event horizon . from this point of view , chiba investigated cylindrical gravitational collapse but his result is not consistent to the nakamura et al s conjecture@xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations by shapiro and teukolsky essentially agrees with chiba s result with respect to the gravitational radiation .",
    "however , we should be concerned about the numerically covered domain since the gravitational waves might be emitted form just the neighborhood of the naked singularity .",
    "recently , present authors investigated the behavior of aspherical perturbations in the ltb space - time and showed that the weyl curvature of even mode perturbations corresponding to outgoing gravitational waves diverges@xcite .",
    "although this result was obtained by numerical integration of linearized einstein equations , the numerical stability is guaranteed much better than that of the numerical simulation of full einstein equations .",
    "further , linearized einstein equations were solved as the characteristic initial value problem and hence the numerically covered domain of the space - time by this analysis is much wider than the previous two numerical simulations .",
    "the results of the linear perturbation analysis of the ltb space - time suggest that gravitational waves will be emitted in the formation process of naked singularities .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to re - analyze the dynamics of perturbations of the ltb space - time in the framework of the newtonian approximation . in order that the singularity of the spherically symmetric space - time is naked , `` the gravitational potential '' @xmath6 is smaller than unity in the neighborhood of the singularity , where @xmath3 is the misner - sharp mass function and @xmath7 is the areal radius .",
    "the central shell focusing naked singularity of the ltb space - time satisfies this condition and further the gravitational potential vanishes even at this singularity .",
    "the speed of the dust fluid is also much smaller than the speed of light before and at the central shell focusing naked singularity formation .",
    "therefore the newtonian approximation seems to be available , even though the space - time curvature is infinite at the singularity .",
    "the advantage of the newtonian approximation scheme is that the dynamics of perturbations of the dust fluid and gravitational waves generated by the motion of the dust fluid are separately estimated ; the evolution of the perturbations of the dust fluid are obtained by the newtonian dynamics and the gravitational radiation is obtained by the quadrupole formula .",
    "hence the semi - analytic estimate of the gravitational radiation due to the matter perturbation of the ltb space - time is possible if we adopt the newtonian approximation .",
    "the results of the newtonian perturbation analysis well agrees with the relativistic perturbation analysis by the present authors .",
    "this suggests that the newtonian analysis will be a powerful tool in the analysis of some category of naked singularity .",
    "however , we should stress that the neighborhood of the naked singularity is not newtonian in ordinary sense , because there is indefinitely strong tidal force .",
    "further , studies of quantum effects have revealed that the violent quantum particle creation occurs in this space - time@xcite .",
    "the particle creation is just a highly relativistic phenomenon .",
    "the newtonian approximation scheme is available to describe the dynamics of the neighborhood of the naked singularity but the situation is not newtonian .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we briefly review the ltb solution . in sec.3 , we consider the newtonian approximation of a spherically symmetric dust collapse and show the relation between the eulerian , lagrangian and synchronous - comoving ( sc ) coordinate systems in this approximation scheme .",
    "further in this section , we show the validity of the newtonian approximation scheme even in the neighborhood of the central shell focusing naked singularity as long as we adopt the eulerian coordinate system .",
    "the basic equations for the even mode of perturbations are presented in sec.4 . in order to estimate the gravitational radiation generated by aspherical perturbations of dust fluid",
    ", we need the knowledge about mass - quadrupole moment .",
    "we show an explicit expression of the quadrupole moment in sec.5 .",
    "then we show the numerical calculation in sec.6 and the asymptotic behavior of the mass - quadrupole moment is presented in sec.7 .",
    "finally , sec.8 is devoted for summary and discussion .    in this article",
    ", we adopt @xmath8 unit and basically follow the convention and notation in ref.@xcite .",
    "the greek indices mean components of tensors , while the latin indices except for @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent a type of a tensor .",
    "we use the sub- or super - scripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 to denote spatial components of tensors .",
    "in general , the gravitational collapse of a spherical dust ball produces a shell focusing naked singularity at the symmetric center .",
    "this singularity can be locally or globally naked in accordance with the initial rest - mass density configuration .",
    "the solution of the einstein equations describing such a situation is known as the ltb space - time .",
    "the line element is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the line element of an unit 2-sphere .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of the dust fluid is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the rest - mass density and @xmath15 is the 4-velocity of the dust fluid element . in the coordinate system ( [ eq : sc - line ] ) , the components of the 4-velocity @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 einstein equations and the equation of motion for the dust fluid lead to the equations for the areal radius @xmath7 and rest - mass density @xmath14 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are arbitrary functions .",
    "eq.([eq : energy - eq ] ) might be regarded as an energy equation of the dust fluid element at @xmath21 . from this point of view",
    ", the function @xmath19 corresponds to the specific energy of the dust fluid element and the function @xmath20 can be regarded as the gravitational mass function .",
    "the solution is completely fixed by choosing the specific energy @xmath19 and initial rest - mass density profile @xmath22 , or equivalently the mass function @xmath20 .",
    "the shell focusing naked singularity is formed only at @xmath23 .    for simplicity",
    ", hereafter we will focus on the marginally bound case @xmath24 .",
    "since our interest is on the behavior of the space - time near the central singularity , this restriction might not lose generality of the conclusion .",

    ", we can naturally introduce a `` gravitational potential '' @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 as hayward discussed , the gravitational potential @xmath29 is deeply related to the formation of trapped region and hence gives a measure of the strength of the gravitational field@xcite . to see the behavior of the gravitational potential @xmath29 and the velocity @xmath31 of the dust fluid element",
    ", we adopt the following initial density configuration for @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are positive constants .",
    "since a sufficient condition for the nakedness of the central shell focusing singularity is @xmath36@xcite , the above initial density distribution necessarily leads to the naked singularity at the symmetric center @xmath23 . here",
    "note that the moment of the central shell focusing singularity is @xmath37 by the above initial density profile . the core radius of the above configuration is given by @xmath38",
    "if we set appropriate @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the space - time is globally naked singular . in fig.1",
    ", we depict the gravitational potential @xmath29 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we see that the gravitational potential @xmath29 is much smaller than unity even at the moment of the central shell focusing naked singularity formation .",
    "note that form eq.([eq : energy - eq ] ) , @xmath41 is also much smaller than unity .",
    "hence in this example , the newtonian approximation scheme seems to be available and in reality it is true as will be shown in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric dust fluid in the framework of the newtonian approximation and show that the newtonian approximation is valid even at the moment of the central shell focusing naked singularity formation if the initial condition is appropriately set up as in the case of the example in the previous section .        for the purpose to follow the motion of a dust sphere , the lagrangian coordinate is more suitable than the eulerian one .",
    "the transformation matrix between the eulerian and lagrangian coordinate systems is given by @xmath47 where regarding @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the independent variables , a dot means a partial derivative with respect to @xmath48 while a prime denotes a partial derivative with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "then the line element in the lagrangian coordinate system is obtained as @xmath50 equations for the dust fluid and newtonian gravitational potential are given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are regarded as arbitrary functions .",
    "since the equation for the areal radius @xmath7 is the same as that of the ltb space - time , its solution for the marginally bound collapse @xmath54 is given by the same functional form as eq.([eq : radius ] ) , @xmath55^{2\\over3 } , \\label{eq : n - radius}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is an arbitrary function which determines the moment of singularity formation .",
    "here we consider the newtonian approximation of the example given in the previous section .",
    "hence we choose the moment of the singularity formation as @xmath57 so that @xmath7 agrees with @xmath49 at @xmath58 . as for the initial density configuration",
    ", we adopt the same functional form as eq.([eq : initial - density ] ) , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are positive constants .",
    "the above choice guarantees the regularity of all the variables before the singularity formation and that the central shell focusing singularity is formed at @xmath62 .    imposing a boundary condition @xmath63 for @xmath64 , the solution of eq.([eq : l - poisson ] )",
    "is formally expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 the behavior of @xmath67 is the same as that of @xmath29 as shown in fig.1 .",

    "it is easy to see that their derivatives with respect to @xmath48 or @xmath49 also take the same functional structure with respect to @xmath80 and @xmath74 .",
    "thus the @xmath49-dependent part @xmath81 of the newtonian gravitational potential will also behave in the manner @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant and @xmath84 is a function of @xmath74 . substituting the above equation into eq.([eq : l - poisson ] ) and using the asymptotic behavior ( [ eq : f - ap ] ) and ( [ eq : r - ap ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath85 in order that the dependence of both sides in the above equation on @xmath80 agrees with each other , @xmath83 should be equal to @xmath86 .",

    "since as shown in the above , this divergence comes from the irregularity of the integrand at the origin @xmath70 , we shall estimate the contribution near the origin to the integral in eq.([eq : dt - phi ] ) .",

    "substituting eqs.([eq : rho - asp])@xmath163([eq : p - asp ] ) into eqs.([eq : rho - eq])@xmath163([eq : p - eq ] ) , and using the asymptotic behavior of the background variables ( [ eq : f - ap])@xmath163([eq : r - ap ] ) , we obtain @xmath210 \\delta\\tau^{-q-7/3}=0,\\label{eq : conti - ap}\\ ] ] @xmath211 and @xmath212 \\delta\\tau^{-r+5/3 } -{2\\over9}w^{4}{\\delta}^{*}_{\\rho}\\delta\\tau^{-p+2}=0.\\label{eq : p - ap}\\ ] ] since the power of @xmath80 should be balanced in each equation , we obtain @xmath213 eqs.([eq : conti - ap])@xmath163([eq : p - ap ] ) constitute a closed system of ordinary differential equations . in order to obtain a solution of the above equations , we also need numerical integration .",
    "however , here we are going to search for regular and gentle solutions of the ordinary differential equations .",
    "this is much easier than the previous numerical integration of the partial differential equations of which solutions show singular behavior .",
    "further high numerical accuracy is guaranteed and therefore the following analysis might be called `` semi - analytic '' .    by an appropriate manipulation@xcite , we obtain a single decoupled equation for @xmath214 as @xmath215 where @xmath216 and @xmath217 giving an appropriate boundary condition , we can numerically solve eqs.([eq : conti - ap])@xmath163([eq : p - ap ] ) as a kind of the eigen value problem to obtain @xmath218 and the solution for @xmath214 .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath219 is given by the following procedure .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath220 , @xmath214 and @xmath221 are @xmath222 functions . by this assumption ,",
    "the perturbation variables are written in the form of the taylor series as , @xmath223 then substituting the above expressions into eqs.([eq : rho - eq])@xmath163([eq : p - eq ] ) , we obtain @xmath224 where @xmath10 is non - negative integer . from the above equations , we obtain @xmath225 since eq.([eq : u - eq ] ) is linear , the value of @xmath226 has no special meaning and hence we set @xmath227 , for simplicity .",
    "then the boundary condition at @xmath219 for eq.([eq : u - eq ] ) is uniquely determined as @xmath228 we numerically integrate eq.([eq : u - eq ] ) outward from @xmath219 by 4th - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the behavior of @xmath214 depends on the value of @xmath218 .    in order to set up the boundary condition at the outer numerical boundary",
    ", we consider the behavior of eq.([eq : u - eq ] ) in the limit of @xmath229 , @xmath230 therefore , @xmath231 behaves as @xmath232 inserting the above equation into eq.([eq : u - eq - ap ] ) , we obtain a 4th - order algebraic equation for @xmath233 .",
    "the solutions of this equation are given by @xmath234 in order to pick up a solution from the above four independent asymptotic solutions , we consider @xmath235 in the limit of @xmath236 , @xmath237 here we impose a condition that @xmath235 is non - zero and finite for @xmath238 at @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is a positive infinitesimal number .",
    "this condition leads to @xmath241 hence by varying @xmath218 , we search for the solution which behaves @xmath242 the numerical calculation reveals that the above behavior is realized when @xmath243 from eq.([eq : power ] ) , we obtain @xmath244 the above values agree with the numerical results ( [ eq : n - results ] ) quite well .",
    "we depict the data for @xmath245 , @xmath214 and @xmath246 in figs.5 , 6 and 7 together with the variables @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 obtained by the numerical calculation of eqs.([eq : vrho - eq2])@xmath163([eq : ut - eq2 ] ) , where @xmath250 and @xmath251 are defined by eqs.([eq : p - rho - def ] ) and ( [ eq : p - phi - def ] ) , respectively .",
    "we see the quite excellent agreement .",
    "now we examine the mass - quadrupole moment @xmath252 and its time - derivatives @xmath253 . in order to see the contribution of the central singularity to @xmath253",
    ", we consider the integrand in the right hand side of eq.([eq : delt - q ] ) .",
    "using eqs.([eq : f - ap ] ) , ( [ eq : r - ap ] ) and ( [ eq : rho - asp ] ) , we obtain @xmath254 from the above equation , we obtain @xmath255    we consider the integral of @xmath256 from @xmath70 to @xmath257 to see the contribution of the central shell focusing naked singularity to the time derivatives of the mass - quadrupole moment . here we take a limit @xmath91 with fixed @xmath258 and then consider the limit @xmath259 . as a result ,",
    "we obtain @xmath260 the above equation and eq.([eq : ap - results ] ) show that the contribution of the central singularity to @xmath253 diverges for @xmath195 if and only if @xmath10 is larger than or equal to 4 .",
    "this result and the quadrupole formula imply that the metric perturbation corresponding to the gravitational radiation and its first order temporal derivative is finite but the second order temporal derivative diverges .",
    "hence the power @xmath141 of the gravitational radiation is finite but the curvature @xmath145 carried by the gravitational waves from the central naked singularity diverges ; see eqs.([eq : g - power ] ) and ( [ eq : curvature ] ) .",
    "this agrees with the relativistic perturbation analysis .",
    "further , we find that in the limit of @xmath195 , @xmath261 this result is also consistent with the relativistic perturbation analysis@xcite .",
    "we analyzed the even mode perturbations of @xmath129 in the spherically symmetric dust collapse in the framework of the newtonian approximation and estimated the gravitational radiation generated by these perturbations by the quadrupole formula .",
    "since we treat separately the dynamics of the matter perturbations and the gravitational waves in the wave zone , we can estimate the asymptotic behavior semi - analytically , where `` semi - analytically '' means that we know it by solving the gentle ordinary differential equations .",
    "this is the great advantage of the newtonian approximation .    as a result",
    ", we found that the power carried by the gravitational waves from the neighborhood of the naked singularity at the symmetric center is finite .",
    "however , the space - time curvature associated to the gravitational waves becomes infinite in accordance with the power law .",
    "this result is consistent with recently performed relativistic perturbation analysis by iguchi et al.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the power index obtained by the newtonian analysis also agrees with the relativistic perturbation analysis quite well .",
    "the agreement between the results of the newtonian and relativistic analyses implies that the perturbations themselves are always confined within the range to which the newtonian approximation is applicable . here",
    "we will focus on the metric perturbation , @xmath161 . since the asymptotic solution of @xmath161 has the same form as eq.([eq : z - ap ] )",
    ", we immediately find that in the limit of @xmath91 with fixed @xmath74 , @xmath262 and hence the assumption @xmath263 of the newtonian approximation is valid in the eulerian coordinate system .",
    "we can also see 2nd - order derivatives . in the same limit , we find @xmath264 from the above equations , we obtain @xmath265 the above equation means that in the limit of @xmath91 with fixed @xmath74 , the following inequality is also satisfied , latexmath:[\\[|\\partial_{t}^{2}{\\delta}^{*}_{\\phi}|\\ll      however as mentioned in sec.2 , the gravitational collapse producing the shell focusing globally naked singularity is not newtonian in ordinary sense . the same is true for the perturbation variables because @xmath267 in the limit of @xmath91 with fixed @xmath74 . even though the newtonian approximation is valid for the eulerian coordinate system , the newtonian order counting breaks down if we adopt the lagrangian coordinate system as the spatial coordinates .",
