    "though during past few decades neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite-@xcite have made great success in revealing the structure of lepton flavor mixing matrix , but still there remain several unanswered questions .",
    "investigation of the fact , whether third neutrino is heavier ( lighter ) than the two neutrinos , whose mass square difference is responsible for atmospheric neutrino oscillations i.e. @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , known as normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy , is one of the most intriguing unanswered questions till now .",
    "investigation of mass hierarchy would be very helpful to disclose the theoretical phenomenology describing the neutrino mass .",
    "an another tantalizing question that present and future oscillation experiments have to uncover is the determination of leptonic cp - violation strength , which depends on cp / t - violation phase @xmath0 or @xmath7 .",
    "this will not only shed light on the theoretical structure behind the complete parallelism between quarks and leptons , but also may be very useful in understanding matter anti - matter asymmetry arising due to baryon number violation in the universe @xcite .",
    "an expected small value of @xmath8 mixing angle is the major problem , as it obscure the sensitivity of both cp - violating phase @xmath0 and mass hierarchy effects @xcite , as is also evident from eqn s .",
    "( [ parti ] ) and ( [ coeff ] ) .",
    "recent confirmation of moderately large value of reactor mixing angle ( @xmath9 ) @xcite , @xcite has opened the door of the possibility for precise determination of leptonic t / cp phase @xmath0 .    due to the fact that @xmath10 @xcite , @xcite , which is true for the constant matter density approximation , sizes and separation between ellipses in @xmath1 plane will be same for all appearance channels in three flavor oscillations , hence it is enough to study any one suitable channel .",
    "relatively long lived charged particles @xmath11 mesons can be easily stored in accelerators and can be accelerated to the desired energies , which make them the most easily available source of @xmath12 and @xmath13 beams . due to this reason present and",
    "most of future oscillation experiments are operating with @xmath14 channel , to which have been preferred to discuss in this article . in order to complete our investigation toward the investigation of optimized experimental configurations ( i.e. base line l and beam energy e )",

    "we will restrict to base lines @xmath15 km , so as to fulfill the constant matter density approximation , as below this base line value we remain confined to earth s crust layer region only .",
    "experiment with smallest base line l=350 km assume the approximation of vacuum oscillations , because of very small matter effects . at long base lines matter contamination to the oscillation effects becomes significantly large , which fake the signal arising due to true / intrinsic t - violation phase in such experiments . though contamination of matter effects hinders the precise direct measurement of cp - violation phase , but it separates the ellipses corresponding to nh and ih far apart , which makes the hierarchy investigation possible .",
    "this effect has been illustrated in figure  [ fig : elpsep ] .",
    "matter contamination at long base lines also increases the size of ellipse at specific beam energy , which in turn make the possible determination of narrow range for @xmath16 phase , this has been illustrated in figure  [ fig : majmin ] . in this article",

    "the values of more than one @xmath8 related solutions especially in case of small base lines , may lie in the 2@xmath18 or 3@xmath18 range of this parameter , which unable the exact determination of phase @xmath0 .",
    "last section discusses in detail of the sources , and how to circumvent this degeneracy within the currently available @xmath19 ranges of mixing parameters @xcite .",
    "the neutrino oscillation pattern in vacuum can be modified significantly during the passage of neutrinos through matter because of the effect of coherent forward scattering of the neutrinos on the nucleons , as has been pointed out by wolfenstein @xcite and by mikheyev and smirnov @xcite .",
    "we can find neutrino transition probability in matter by starting from neutrino oscillation in vacuum with consideration of the evolution of the neutrino state vector described by `` schr@xmath20dinger equation '' , for literature may see @xcite-@xcite . throughout the whole literature ,",
    "results of neutrino oscillation experiments have been usually analyzed under the simplest assumption of oscillations between two neutrino types .",

    "( [ soln7 ] ) and ( [ soln8 ] ) the following inequality , @xmath95 this physical region has been shown by green curve enclosing the ellipses in figure  [ fig : ellips3 ] . in this figure",

    "thus we conclude to say , if there is opposite sign degeneracy at small base line , it will get circumvented at longer base lines for the same other experimental inputs .",
    "this is due to the fact , as matter effects in long base lines increase , which in turn pull the two different hierarchy cp trajectory ellipses more apart , as we can confirm from figure  [ fig : ellips1 ] .",
    "opposite sign degeneracy has physical manifestation as long as two ellipses corresponding to nh and ih are overlapping .",
    "we can avoid overlapping of opposite sign ellipses by appropriately choosing longer base line l and specific beam energy e. to find an optimized l and e configuration , figure  [ fig : elpsep ] is very guiding .",

    "to explore an optimal set up in order to investigate mass hierarchy , separation between two opposite hierarchy ellipses in the biprobability ( p  @xmath102 ) plane , serves as an optimization parameter .",
    "it is evident from figures  [ fig : elpsep ] and [ fig : ellips1 ] , at larger base lines hierarchy ellipses separate to large extent as compared to the smaller base lines , which suggests that longer base lines are useful to investigate mass hierarchy in the the @xmath1 plane .",
    "we come to know from figures [ fig : ellsep2d ] and [ fig : elpsep ] that at given base line below a specific value of beam energy , oscillations becomes very fast and separation between hierarchy ellipses becomes so small , that they may overlap to large extent too .",
    "this value of beam energy has values @xmath103 3 , 2 , 1.3 , 0.8 and @xmath103 0.1 & @xmath104 1.0 gev , respectively for base lines 2900 , 2100 , 1200 , 730 and 350 km .",
    "the hierarchy investigation in the context of biprobability - plane provides an elegant way .",
    "the major drawback that could hinder precise measurement of hierarchy is that , there always exist four fold degeneracy for any coordinate in the @xmath1 plane within the @xmath105 parameter space .",
    "opposite sign degeneracy have physical existence in the case when two hierarchy ellipses overlap .",
    "to get rid of this degeneracy we need to observe the results at suitable long base lines and beam energy .",
    "same sign degeneracy disappears as soon as @xmath106 , which is fulfilled for @xmath107 km for n=1 and for @xmath108 km for n=2 scenario .",
    "it is recommended to especially follow figure  [ fig : elpsep ] in order to choose suitable l and e configurations at which both the opposite and same sign degeneracies can be circumvented .",
    "also we can analyze from table  [ tab : tabsep ] that , experimental configuration l=2,535 km , e=5 gev for n=1 scenario , is the most suitable one that fulfills the criteria mentioned in previous line .",
