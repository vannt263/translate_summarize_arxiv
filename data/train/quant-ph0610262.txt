    "the investigation of the spectral properties of strongly interacting microscopic many - body quantum systems necessitates the use of non - perturbative approaches .",
    "most of these rest on the renormalization group concept introduced by wilson  @xcite and universally used since in all fields of quantum physics .",
    "this is the case for the study of lattice quantum systems for which the real space renormalization group ( rsrg )  @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite have been introduced in order to reduce the dimensions of the systems .",
    "more generally the particular property of the renormalization methods is the fact that they can reveal the existence and location of phase transitions which are characterized as fixed points , i.e. the coupling strengths which define the hamiltonian or the action of the systems and evolve during the renormalization process ( running coupling constants ) stay constant at these specific points , both in the case of discontinuous and continuous transitions  @xcite .",
    "the reduction process has mainly been applied in @xmath0-dimensional real and momentum space . in the present approach",
    "we introduce a reduction algorithm which operates in @xmath1 hilbert space .",
    "the spectral properties of quantum systems are obtained through the diagonalization of a many - body hamiltonian acting in a complete , in general infinite or at least very large set of basis states although the information of interest is restricted to the knowledge of a few low - energy states .    in order to avoid the diagonalization of very large matrices we recently proposed a non - perturbative approach which tackles this question  @xcite .",
    "we implemented it in the study of strongly interacting systems like frustrated two - leg ladders  @xcite .",
    "the approach consists of a step by step reduction of the size of hilbert space by means of a projection technique .",
    "it induces a renormalization process in the spirit of former work  @xcite .",
    "its advantage over other reduction procedures lies in the fact that it is applicable to all types of microscopic quantum systems since it works in hilbert space like in the procedure developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work we concentrate on the use of the algorithm in order to characterise and study interacting systems in the vicinity of discontinuous ( first order ) phase transitions and avoided crossings which are signalized by the existence of fixed points at which coupling constants stay constant during the reduction process .",
