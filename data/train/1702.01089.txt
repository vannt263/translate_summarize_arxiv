    "semi - tauonic @xmath4 decays have attracted renewed attention after the measurements of the exclusive channels @xmath9 , which exhibit a tension with the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , the theoretical predictions within the sm turn out to be quite precise , since one of the relevant form factors can be inferred from the decays into light leptons ( electrons and muons ) , while the longitudinal form factor that appears only for the heavy @xmath0 lepton can be related to the known one by heavy quark symmetries ( hqs ) .",
    "although the use of hqs implies corrections of the order @xmath10 , a good precision is maintained due to the fact , that the contribution of the longitudinal form factor receives an additional suppression factor @xmath11 .",
    "however , there is another problem with the current data on exclusive semi - tauonic @xmath4 decays which is related to the degree of saturation of the inclusive @xmath12 rate . there is on the one hand a measurement of this inclusive rate based on the @xmath13-hadron admixture as it was generated by lep @xcite , @xmath14 which to leading order in the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) should be the branching ratio for each individual hadron . on the other hand",
    ", one may also compute the inclusive semi - tauonic ratio @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a light lepton .",
    "this ratio does not depend on @xmath17 and can been computed within the hqe very precisely . in combination with",
    "the accurately measured branching ratio @xmath18 one finds in the @xmath19 scheme including corrections up to @xmath20 @xcite @xmath21 in full agreement with the lep measurement . taking the current data for @xmath22 and @xmath23 at face value , the two exclusive decay modes @xmath24 and @xmath25 would at least fully saturate ( if not oversaturate ) the inclusive rate .",
    "this situation has motivated us to perform an independent calculation of @xmath12 within the hqe .",
    "the calculation presented in @xcite makes use of the @xmath19 scheme and includes terms up to order @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we present a calculation in the kinetic scheme and include terms up to order @xmath26 , improving the existing calculations by including the next order in the hqe . in the light of the quite precise prediction for the inclusive @xmath12 rate we discuss the theoretical predictions for the exclusive channels @xmath27 and compare to the current experimental situation .",
    "the matrix element for the @xmath28 @xmath29 decay can be written in terms of the low energy effective hamiltonian for the weak process",
    "@xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the leptonic and hadronic currents , respectively , and @xmath17 is the ckm matrix element involved in the decay .    we express the triple - differential distribution for @xmath28 in terms of the energies of the lepton and neutrino @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the dilepton invariant mass @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are called the leptonic and hadronic tensors , respectively . in the standard model , the leptonic tensor takes the form @xmath40 and the hadronic tensor is defined as @xmath41 its general decomposition into scalar functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 reads @xmath44 after contraction of leptonic and hadronic tensors the triple differential decay rate takes the form : @xmath45 - \\frac{1}{2 } m_\\ell^4 w_4 \\big\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the optical theorem , the hadronic tensor @xmath46 is related to the discontinuity of a time - ordered product of currents : @xmath47 via the relations @xmath48 with the structure functions @xmath49 defined in analogy to @xmath46 : @xmath50    inserting @xmath51 for the momentum of the @xmath13 quark and expanding in the residual momentum @xmath52 yields the standard ope as it is used for the light leptons @xcite .    in order to calculate @xmath0-lepton energy spectrum and decay width",
    "we need to define the kinematic boundaries of the variable involved in the triple differential decay rate ( [ eq : trip - distr - contr ] ) .",
    "we introduce the following dimensionless variables @xmath53 and the mass parameters @xmath54 we first perform an integration over the energy of the final state neutrino @xmath35 and in terms of corresponding dimensionless variable @xmath55 the limits of integration are determined as @xmath56 subsequently we perform the integration over variable @xmath57 with corresponding boundaries : @xmath58 and one gets the @xmath0-lepton energy distribution .",
    "integration over all possible values of the @xmath0-lepton energy @xmath59 allows us to calculate decay width .    in this way",
    "we obtain the analytic result for the decay width which can be presented in the following form : @xmath60 ,   \\label{eq : decay - width - res}\\ ] ] where nonperturbative parameters @xmath61 are the same as @xmath62 defined in @xcite ( we omitted `` hat '' for brevity ) , the coefficients @xmath63 depend on @xmath64 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 the calculation of the decay width revealed that - as in the case of a massless lepton - the corresponding coefficients @xmath67 for massive @xmath0-lepton also vanishes , @xmath68 .",
    "the explicit analytic expressions for coefficients @xmath69 as functions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be found in appendix .",
    "the derived expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath71 are in agreement with the corresponding results of @xcite , while analytic formula for @xmath72 represents a new result of this paper which in the particular case @xmath73 ( or equivalently @xmath74 ) reproduces the corresponding expression in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we include perturbative radiative corrections to the partonic level of the decay width using results of @xcite .",
    "this correction is presented as @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay - width - res ] ) . additionally , we include the electroweak correction @xmath76 to the decay width which is well - known and can be found in @xcite : @xmath77    aside from the decay width there are other observables of interest from the experimental side , such as @xmath0-lepton energy distribution and their moments .",
    "we define the moments of the @xmath0-lepton energy distribution as in @xcite @xmath78 and the central moments @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the energy cut of @xmath0-lepton and @xmath81 is its maximal value .",
