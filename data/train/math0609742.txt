    "witten gave in @xcite a path integral formulation of the chern - simons field theory which gives a framework for understanding many invariants of knots in a 3-manifold .",
    "but path integral is not yet well defined mathematically .",
    "though , the perturbative expansion method for the path integral gives a mathematical definition of knot invariants .",
    "it is defined by configuration space integral with certain uni - trivalent graphs called jacobi diagrams .",
    "this construction of invariants has been studied by axelrod - singer , bar - natan , guadagnini - martellini - mintchev , kohno , kontsevich , bott - taubes , dylan thurston and others @xcite .",
    "it is known that the configuration space integral invariant of knots in @xmath4 is a universal finite type ( or vassiliev ) invariant @xcite .",
    "there is a higher dimensional analogue of these theory with a certain variant of jacobi diagrams .",
    "the suitable diagrams for higher dimensions are graphs with two kinds of edges corresponding to the  angular forms \" in @xmath5 and in @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the diagrams have degrees given by half the number of vertices .",
    "in his seminal paper , bott constructed an invariant for higher dimensional knots @xcite associated to degree 2 diagrams .",
    "after that cattaneo and rossi gave a path integral formula for invariants of higher dimensional embedded manifolds into a manifold and as a perturbative expansion of it , they obtained invariants for higher dimensional knots , which will be denoted by @xmath7 in this paper , associated to degree @xmath8 diagrams @xcite .",
    "it may be a generalization of the 3-dimensional perturbative chern - simons theory and bott s invariant is the degree 2 part of cattaneo - rossi s invariant .",
    "so we call @xmath9 the bott - cattaneo - rossi invariant , or the bcr invariant for short .",
    "more precisely , cattaneo - rossi proved that @xmath9 ( or its framing correction ) is an isotopy invariant if @xmath0 is odd ( or @xmath10 ) .",
    "the bcr invariant currently seems to be a new invariant of long @xmath0-knots .",
    "however , it has not been known whether @xmath9 is non - trivial or not .",
    "so we try to understand its features , in particular , whether there is some connection with known invariants .",
    "in this paper we study the invariant @xmath7 restricting to a certain class of long @xmath0-knots called long ribbon @xmath0-knots . the class of long ribbon @xmath0-knots is a rather familiar class known to have similarities to the classical knot theory in 3-dimension .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , habiro , kanenobu and shima introduced the notion of finite type invariant of ribbon 2-knots , which is straightforwardly generalizable to long ribbon @xmath0-knots , and showed that the coefficients of the alexander polynomial expanded as a power series in @xmath11 , are finite type invariants .",
    "finite type invariant of type @xmath8 is defined by the condition that a given invariant vanishes at any ` @xmath12-th order differential ' of a ribbon 2-knot .",
    "moreover , habiro and shima obtained in @xcite a remarkable result saying that the set of all finite type invariants is isomorphic as a graded algebra to the polynomial algebra in the coefficients of the alexander polynomial .",
    "restricting to long ribbon @xmath0-knots , we characterize the bcr invariant @xmath9 as a finite type invariant ( theorem  [ thm : zuniversal ] ) .",
    "in particular , we determine its ` highest order term ' explicitly . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain a description in terms of the coefficients of the logarithm of the alexander polynomial at @xmath13 with an explicit highest order term .",
    "in particular , it shows that the bcr invariant is non - trivial . the proof is done by choosing an embedding for a long ribbon @xmath0-knot in some extreme situation and then computing @xmath9 explicitly at the @xmath8-th order differentials of long ribbon @xmath0-knots . in the limit , the computation of the integral is highly reduced and we can compute explicitly . the presence of two kinds of edges in the diagrams appearing in the definition of the bcr invariant makes the computation slightly complicated .",
    "but the spirit in the computation is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we consider also the cases of long @xmath0-knots of codimension @xmath14 .",
    "recently , budney proved in @xcite that the space @xmath15 of long embeddings is @xmath16-connected if @xmath17 , namely , all homotopy groups in dimensions @xmath18 vanish . in this paper",
    "we study the cohomology of @xmath15 in dimensions higher than budney s bound @xmath19 . a similar proof to theorem  [ thm : zuniversal ] works to prove the non - triviality of some cohomology classes of @xmath15 in this range .",
    "this study is inspired mainly by the result of cattaneo , cotta - ramusino and longoni , which concerns the case @xmath20 , proving that the chern - simons perturbative series classes are non - trivial in cohomology of @xmath21 when @xmath22 @xcite . in the case of higher dimensions @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath24 , the analogous construction to the bcr invariant also yields cohomology classes of @xmath15 if @xmath25 are odd .",
    "we prove that half of these classes are non - trivial and thus give an estimate below for @xmath26 .",
    "the strategy of the proof is similar to @xcite , that is to construct a certain cycle in @xmath15 and to evaluate the cohomology class on the cycle .",
    "we also study the bcr invariant for some classes , which we call long handle knots , other than ribbon .",
    "we observe that for long handle knots , the bcr invariant is expressed non - trivially in terms of the coefficients of levine s generalizations of the alexander polynomial in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "the definition of the bcr invariant @xmath9 is given and the cattaneo - rossi s result concerning the invariance of their invariant is stated .",
    "the bcr invariant is defined as a linear combination of the integrals over the configuration spaces associated with certain graphs . in  3",
    ", we will explain the generality on the space of graphs from which each coefficient in @xmath9 at a configuration space integral of a graph are determined .",
    "this section is somewhat digressive but needed in the invariance proof of @xmath9 in the appendix . in  4 , we restrict the study to long ribbon @xmath0-knots .",
    "the notion of habiro - kanenobu - shima s finite type invariant is recalled and the main theorem ( theorem  [ thm : zuniversal ] ) about the characterization of @xmath9 as a finite type invariant is stated and proved .",
    "the relation between @xmath9 and the alexander polynomial is explained at the end of  4 . in  5 , higher codimension results are given .",
    "we prove that higher bcr invariant classes are non - trivial .",
    "the proof is somewhat parallel to that of the theorem  [ thm : zuniversal ] and sometimes we refer some words from the former .",
    "so if the reader has read the proof of theorem  [ thm : zuniversal ] , then the proof of non - triviality may be more understandable . in ",
    "[ s : remark ] , we remark some result about the value of @xmath7 for some long @xmath0-knots other than ribbon and state a few problems . appendix  a is devoted to the self - contained proof of invariance of the bcr invariant @xmath7 , which is originally described in @xcite , filling the details not explicitly described in @xcite .",

    "|=======================================================================    +    +    since the integration along the sphere factors contributes by 1 , the    integral restricted to these faces is @xmath982 by the ihx relation .",
    "now we prove the vanishing of @xmath112 restricted to the hidden faces .",
    "let @xmath983 be a set of points to be collapsed having external edges ( edges connecting points in @xmath795 and points not in @xmath795 ) and let @xmath984 be the subgraph of @xmath34 consisting of edges connecting two vertices in @xmath795 .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to prove the following proposition .                  by lemma  [ lem : hiddenexternaledge ] and proposition  [ prop : a_n ] , for a non vanishing face the @xmath35 part of @xmath984 must form a disjoint union of chords , trees and wheels entirely included in @xmath984 .",
    "so we assume this condition in the rest of the proof .",
    "suppose that there exists an @xmath36-edge going from a point in @xmath795 to a point not in @xmath795 .",
    "then @xmath984 consists of a sequence of subgraphs as in ( [ eq : hairy - strut])(b ) joined by @xmath36-edges .",
    "if @xmath984 has a tree component with at least one internal vertex , then consider the automorphism on the fiber of @xmath799 defined as in figure  [ fig : inv - tree ] , which reverses ( resp .",
    "preserves ) the orientation of the fiber and preserves ( resp .",
    "reverses ) the sign of the form if @xmath0 is odd ( resp .",
    "hence the integral vanishes .",
    "if @xmath34 has only chords in its @xmath35 part , then by the assumption , there has to be at least two chords connected by an @xmath36-edge . but",
    "this case does not contribute by lemma  [ lem : hiddenchords ] .      by the observations in  [ ss :",
    "face ] , the face @xmath785 is a bundle @xmath987 with fiber @xmath988 the configuration space associated to the subgraph @xmath984 modulo translations and dilations . since @xmath984 is not connected , we can consider the action @xmath989 on @xmath988 which translates one connected component in @xmath984 fixing all other components .",
    "it is easy to see from @xmath986 that this action is non trivial on @xmath988 and the quotient map @xmath990 gives rise to a bundle @xmath991 with @xmath0 or @xmath31 dimensional fiber , depending on whether the translated component has external vertices or not . since the @xmath989-action does not affect to the integrand form @xmath661 extended to @xmath785 , namely the integrand form can be written as @xmath992 for some form @xmath993 on @xmath994 .",
    "thus @xmath995 where the integration is the fiber integration .",
    "the last integral is over the space with codimension at least @xmath198 and so it vanishes .",

    "let @xmath1001 be external vertices of @xmath34 mapped into an underlying @xmath0 dimensional plane with a tangent frame @xmath1002 and @xmath1003 be internal vertices of @xmath34 in the ambient space @xmath5 so that @xmath1004 . then consider the involution @xmath1005 on the fiber .",
    "since @xmath1006 is odd if @xmath0 is odd , @xmath172 reverses the orientation of the fiber of @xmath1007 and preserves the form @xmath1008 . therefore the integration along the fiber vanishes as in the proof of lemma  [ lem : involution ] .",
