    "the x - ray spectra of agn usually show a soft x - ray excess ( hereafter , soft excess ) above the low energy extrapolation of the 2 - 10  kev power law emission .",
    "the shape of this soft excess is often equally well modelled by either smeared , ionised reflection ( presumably from the surface of the putative accretion disc : @xcite ; @xcite ) or by a separate soft continuum component ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray spectral fitting alone can not distinguish between these quite smooth spectral models given the typically bandpass available to x - ray observatories .",
    "studies of x - ray variability can give complementary information , potentially breaking this deadlock .",
    "the x - ray reflection model predicts time delays between variations in the primary continuum , and the reflected response of the disc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the primary features of a disc reflected spectrum include fluorescence / resonance line emission , particularly from iron , and a curved continuum at high energies .",
    "the signal - to - noise around the @xmath3  kev fe k@xmath2 line is often rather low , but if the disc surface is moderately ionised there could also be strong soft x - ray emission ( e.g. @xcite ) , and this soft emission will also lag behind the illuminating continuum .",
    "however , these lags are simply the light travel time to the reflector , so should be short ( @xmath4  seconds for @xmath5 ) so are best probed by the fastest variability .",
    "concentrating on fast variability is also necessary as accreting black holes ( bhs ) seem to display hard lags at low frequencies  slow variations in the hard energy bands are delayed with respect to the soft energy bands ( @xcite ; @xcitea ; @xciteb ; @xcitea ; @xciteb ; @xcite ) .",
    "the favoured model for the origin of hard lags is the radial propagation of accretion rate fluctuations through a stratified emission region ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in combination , these two effects predict a switch from hard ( propagation ) lags at lower frequencies to soft ( reflection ) lags at higher frequencies .",
    "this pattern was tentatively observed in @xcite , and has now been observed in @xmath6 agn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and one black hole x - ray binary ( xrb ; @xcite ) .",
    "narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) are the targets of choice for much of this work as they are typically brighter in soft x - rays , and have low black hole mass , so their variability timescales are the shortest amongst agn , so they can be studied more easily in single observations at high signal - to - noise .",
    "a subset of nls1s ( the ` complex ' nls1s : @xcite ) can also show much more dramatic variability than seen in broad line seyfert 1s ( bls1s ) , with deep dips in their x - ray light curves where their spectra appear dominated by reflection ( @xcite ; 2009 ) .",
    "hence these should give the clearest detections of reverberation lags , contrasting with the ` simple ' nls1 , which show only moderate reflection and variability amplitude @xcite .",
    "nls1s typically show stronger soft excesses than broad line agn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , so the soft lag signature should be strong in all these systems if the soft excess is from reflection .",
    "however , detailed spectral decomposition shows that the majority of the strong soft x - ray emission in nls1s can be attributed to direct emission from the accretion disc , itself extending into the soft x - ray bandpass .",
    "there is still a ` true ' soft excess ( which can again be made from either ionised reflection or an additional component ) in addition to the disc and coronal components , but it is actually smaller than in broad line objects ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; hereafter j13 ) .",
    "j13 used frequency resolved spectroscopy ( e.g. @xcite ) as another approach to study the origin of the ` true ' soft excess in the ` simple ' nls1 pg 1244 + 026  . the fastest variability ( timescales @xmath7  s ) has a spectrum in which the soft excess is less prominent than in the time averaged spectrum , as expected if the corona is closest to the black hole so has more rapid variability than the soft excess and disc emission ( j13 ) . however",
    ", little of this rapid variability of the soft excess is correlated with the 3 - 10  kev light curve .",
    "this seems to rule out an ionised reflection origin for the majority of the soft excess , since ionised reflection produces simultaneously the soft excess and the fe k@xmath2 line and reflection continuum at higher energies ( j13 ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore the time lags from pg 1244 + 026  as a function of fourier frequency and of energy .",

    "the pn data were taken in small window ( sw ) mode , which reduces the impact of event pile - up ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we use 0.30.7  kev as a soft band to maximise the disc and soft excess components , with little contamination from the hard x - ray coronal emission , and 1.2 - 4  kev as a hard band to maximise the coronal emission , with little contamination from the soft excess or reflected iron k@xmath2 emission ( j13 , see also fig .",

    "we then averaged in geometrically spaced frequency bins ( each bin spanning a factor @xmath11 in frequency ) .",
    "for the analysis in this paper we use segment sizes of 20 ks and time bins of 20 s , leaving 6 segments in total .",
    "the choice of segment length and frequency bin averaging was chosen to maximise the number of data points being averaged in the cross - spectrum , whilst still maintaining a high enough frequency resolution to pick out any features in the cross - spectral products .",

    "the poisson noise level is estimated using equation a2 of @xcite , and is indicated by the dashed lines .    from the cross - spectra we get the coherence between the hard and soft band ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the coherence is defined between [ 0,1 ] , where 1 is perfect coherence and 0 is perfect incoherence .",

    "the noise corrected coherence is high ( @xmath12 ) for frequencies up to @xmath13 hz , showing that soft and hard band variations are very well correlated on timescales longer than a few ks , but then drops to @xmath14 between @xmath15 hz , and becomes well correlated again at frequencies higher than @xmath16 hz .    from the cross - spectrum",
    "we also obtain a phase lag at each frequency , @xmath17 , which we transform into the corresponding time lag @xmath18 with errors estimated using raw coherence ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we checked this method produces reliable error estimates when the contribution of poisson noise is large using monte carlo simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lower panel shows these frequency dependent time lags between the soft and hard bands , where we follow convention by using a negative time lag to indicate the soft band lagging behind the hard band ( hereafter ` soft lags ' ) .",
    "the lag - frequency spectrum shows a hard lag at frequencies below @xmath19 hz , whereas between @xmath20 and @xmath21 the soft emission lags the hard , with a maximum soft lag of @xmath22s at @xmath23hz .",
    "this shape is similar to that seen in other sources , and seems to be quite common in low - redshift , x - ray variable agn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "-function responses in each band .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ fig : lag_mod ] for details.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in this section we model the lag - frequency spectra using simple analytical models . following the approach of @xcite ( and references therein ) we use a top hat response functions ( or transfer functions when discussing the response function in the fourier domain ) , as well as a power - law dependence on lag - frequency , to model the frequency dependent time delays .",
    "the response functions can be present in either the hard band , the soft band or both , together with a @xmath24-function response to account for direct ( unreprocessed ) emission .",
    "the difference between these two ( actually , the complex argument of the product of the two complex transfer functions , see @xcite ) predicts the lag - frequency data between the two bands .",
    "we fit the lag - frequency data using standard @xmath25 fitting techniques , integrating the model over the bin width , rather than fitting just at the bin centre .",
    "a roughly power - law frequency dependence of the hard x - ray time lag is well established in x - ray binaries ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , at least at low frequencies , and consistent results from agn have been reported several times ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore consider a power - law model of the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "however , a power - law response function alone ( with no @xmath24-function ) for the hard band gives an unacceptable fit to the lag - frequency data ( @xmath28 ) , as this predicts only positive ( hard ) lags .",
    "we next model the response of the system assuming a @xmath24 function in the soft band , and a @xmath24 function plus a top hat in the hard band .",
    "the @xmath24 functions represent the non - delayed continuum emission in each band .",
    "a @xmath24 function plus top hat is clearly just an approximation to a more complex response function , but is relatively simple to fit and allows for comparison with previous work in this area .",
    "the parameters of the top hat are start time @xmath29 , width @xmath30 and area @xmath31 ( which sets the intensity of delayed emission relative to the direct emission ) .",
    "this was used to model distant reflection by @xcite , but the physical picture here is that it models the propagation time delays , as there is probably little reflection contributing to our ` hard ' ( 1.2 - 4  kev ) bandpass ( see @xcite , j13 ) .",
    "however , irrespective of the way this is interpreted , this can reproduce both positive and negative lags from ` ringing ' in the fourier domain as a result of the sharp edges of the impulse response function @xcite .",
    "this model also gives a poor fit to the data ( @xmath32 ) as the resulting negative lag from ringing is too sharp to explain the broad frequency range of the observed soft lag ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we next considered models including an additional top hat response in the soft band response , where this soft top hat is now physically modelling a reverberation response to the direct emission , whereas the top hat in the hard band is modelling propagation lags . thus the total model is a @xmath24 function plus top hat in both hard and soft bands , giving a total of 6 free parameters ( 3 for each top hat ) .",
    "we find a good fit to the data with @xmath33 = 9 / 5 d.o.f ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the full resolution model is shown as the red solid line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lag_mod ] ) .",
    "the hard response parameters are : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , while the soft response parameters are : @xmath38 , width @xmath39 , and scaling fraction @xmath40 .",
    "the lags due to any one component of the combined model can be isolated by computing the lag - frequency curve assuming that the response function in the other band is simply a @xmath24 function .",
    "if the soft band response is replaced by a @xmath24 function then the top hat in the hard causes the hard band variations to lag the soft band variations ( dashed line ) .",
    "conversely if the hard band response is replaced by a @xmath24 function then the top hat in the soft band causes the soft to lag the hard ( dotted line ) , but the soft lag extends to higher frequencies due to the narrower width of the top hat in the soft band than in the hard . the lags measured between the two bands , as a function of frequency , is a combination of these lags on each band which may be operating in different directions and so partially cancelling out .",
    "the lag from the combined model is approximately the sum of the lag contributions from each model component ( these two are not in general exactly equal as the phase difference between two transfer functions is computed after averaging the real and imaginary components of each transfer function over the finite frequency bins ) .",
    "the typical propagation lags of the hard band behind the soft band are @xmath41  s , while the typical reverberation timescale lags of the soft band behind the hard band are of order @xmath42  s. it is this timescale which gives the size scale of the reprocessor , not the lag of @xmath22  seconds as given from the cross - spectrum as the latter does not include the effect of dilution of the lagged flux ( top hat ) by the direct flux ( @xmath24 function ) ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence the reprocessing typically occurs on size scales of @xmath43 for a black hole mass of @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the model still does not quite match the soft lags observed at the highest frequencies .",
    "we could improve the fit by adding another top hat in the soft band , starting from @xmath45 with width of @xmath46  few hundred seconds .",
    "this would skew the response more towards shorter timescales i.e. to weight the reverberation towards smaller distance material .",
    "given the limited frequency resolution , such a complex model will over - fit the data .",
    "we note that improvement in fitting the highest frequency soft lags may also be achieved with the use of ` realistic ' response function , rather than a simple top hat plus @xmath24 function in the soft band ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a lag - energy spectrum can be calculated over a given range in frequency by estimating the cross - spectral lag between a light curve in each energy band with respect to the frequency resolved light curve over a broad reference band ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we take our reference band as the hard band in the previous lag - frequency work i.e. the 1.24.0 kev light curve _ minus _ the energy band for which the lag is being computed so that we never have correlated poisson noise .",
    "this reference band is chosen to maximise the lags between the coronal emission and the soft excess and reflected iron k@xmath2 emission ( see fig .  1 in j13 ) .",
    "this reduces the contribution to the reference band from the uncorrelated ( incoherent ) softest energy variations ( j13 ) .",
    "a positive lag indicates the given energy bin lags the broad reference band ( so soft lags are now positive ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : lag_en_plot ] shows the lag as a function of energy for the lf , hf and vhf frequencies . at lf ( lower panel ) the soft energies lead the 1.2 - 4.0  kev reference band , with the delay increasing with energy separation .",
    "this is consistent with results found in bh - xrbs ( e.g @xcite ; @xcite ) and agn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . a possible ( @xmath52 significance ) lag in the iron k band can be seen , which lags behind the 1.24.0  kev reference band by @xmath53s . in fig.[fig : lag_en_lf ] we show the lf lag - energy spectrum computed using the broad 0.3 - 10 kev energy band .",

    "j13 presented several spectral models to explain the time averaged spectrum and the covariance spectra . in this section",
    "we re - examine these models in terms of their lag - energy predictions .",
    "we model the resulting lag - energy spectra using simulations , similar to the method of @xcite .",
    "we simulated identical sets of light curves for each energy bin , including independent poisson noise in each .",
    "the light curves of each component ( at each energy ) were time - shifted and then combined weighted by the strength of the component in the mean spectrum at a given energy .",
    "the lag - energy spectra at each frequency were modelled independently , with each component having a different magnitude at each frequency .",
    "this is clearly a simplification of the effects of an impulse response function on each spectral component , but allows us to approximate the shape of the lag - energy spectrum resulting from the combined effects of multiple components .",
    "we first use the spectral components identified in j13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec]a ) , where there is a blackbody from intrinsic disc emission ( red ) , a separate soft excess component ( green ) which provides seed photons to produce the coronal emission from compton upscattering ( blue ) .",
    "this coronal emission illuminates the disc and produces a ( mostly ) neutral reflection spectrum ( black ) from a region with inner radius of @xmath62 .",
    "the soft excess component is modelled with comptt ( @xcite , representing incomplete thermalisation of the inner accretion disc ( see @xcite ) .    for slow variability , where we are seeing propagation time delays , we assume that the blackbody disc emission leads , followed by the soft excess , followed by the corona .",
    "this gives a good match to the lf lag - energy spectra if the soft excess lags 400 seconds behind the blackbody , and the corona lags by 1500 seconds behind the blackbody .",
    "a reflection lag of 2  ks behind the corona is included , to model any reflection that is occurring on top of the propagation delays at lf .",
    "the soft band emission then leads the hard band by @xmath41 seconds , as required by the lag - frequency fits ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lag_mod ] ) .",
    "these simulated lf lag - energy spectra are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lagenmod ] .",
    "the hf lag energy can be matched by assuming that some part of the soft excess emission is reprocessed on short timescales , so that it lags behind the corona by 300 seconds ( middle panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : lagenmod ] ) .",
    "no iron k@xmath2 is seen in the data at this frequency , but we include a 300 second lag for this feature . if an iron k@xmath2 reflection feature is observed at vhf , and at lf with a longer delay than in the vhf , then we might also expect to see this feature at hf .",
    "its presence in the lf suggests this feature has not been smeared out over the timescale of interest , and hence why we expect to observe it at hf .",
    "an iron line is instead seen in the vhf lag - energy plot .",
    "this can be well described if some fraction of the reflected emission lags 200 seconds behind the fastest coronal variability . however , this can not reproduce the low energy lag seen in the vhf ( blue simulations in upper panel of fig .  [",

    "the model above is an extreme interpretation of the spectrum .",
    "the reflector is likely to be ionized to some extent , so we explore how this might change the reverberation predictions .",
    "we allow reflection to be ionised in the fits .",
    "we describe this using the rfxconv model ( @xcite ) , which is a convolution version of the ross & fabian ( 2005 ) ionized reflection models , but also include an additional soft excess as is required by the fast covariance spectra ( j13 ) .",
    "however , this gives a best fitting model ( @xmath33 = 2204 / 1799 d.o.f ) to the time averaged epic spectrum for fairly low ionisation @xmath63 , which is again not highly smeared by relativistic effects ( @xmath64 for standard emissivity of @xmath65 ) .",
    "this does not produce much more low energy reflection than the original models , so instead we fix @xmath66 to explore the impact of the maximal contribution of reflection at low energies .",
    "this gives a slightly worse fit with @xmath33 = 2220 / 1800 d.o.f , and requires @xmath67 in order to smooth the low energy atomic features , and so implies high spin , in contrast to the intrinsic disc component in this source which implies low spin ( @xcite ) .",

    "the lag prediction from this maximal reflection model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lagenmod]b , calculated using the same lags for each component as before .",
    "they are not dramatically different to those from neutral reflection , possibly because the ionised reflection is still a small fraction of the soft band flux , relative to the other components .",
    "the additional blackbody variability is still required in the vhf to match the soft lag seen in these data as the reflected emission follows the illuminating spectrum , and there is a downturn in the illuminating spectrum at low energies due to the seed photon energy for compton upscattering being within the observed bandpass ( j13 ) .",
    "this downturn limits the amount of reflection at the lowest energies .",
    "we show that the x - ray time delays as a function of energy and fourier - frequency can be constrained in the ` simple ' nls1 pg 1244 + 026 using a 120ks xmm - newton observation .",
    "the lag as a function of frequency between a hard ( 1.24.0kev ) and a soft ( 0.3 - 1  kev ) energy band shows the now well established switch from a hard lag at low frequencies to a soft lag at high frequencies .",
    "the maximum soft lag of @xmath68 s is at @xmath23hz but there is also evidence for a second negative lag of @xmath69s at @xmath70hz .",
    "modelling the lag - frequency spectrum with simple response functions gives an acceptable fit if both hard and soft bands contain both direct emission ( modelled using a @xmath24-function response ) and a smoothed , time - delayed response ( approximated by a top hat response function ) .",
    "we interpret the lagged response in two different ways in the two different bands , with the hard band lag being a result of propagation time delays while the soft band lag results from reprocessing of the primary x - ray spectrum .",
    "the soft band response function has a maximum time delay of @xmath71s . for a black hole mass of @xmath72 ,",
    "this corresponds to reprocessing within @xmath73 of the illuminating source .",
    "we consider the lag as a function of energy in three frequency ranges .",
    "the lag - energy data are consistent with the interpretation above .",
    "the lowest frequency lag - energy spectra shows the long timescale variability has a lag which increases systematically with energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lag_en_plot ] ) .",
    "this is expected from propagating fluctuations through the accretion flow , where the disc , soft excess and harder x - ray emission from a spatially extended corona are produced at progressively smaller radii .",
    "the slow variability originates in the disc , propagates to the soft excess , then propagates to the corona .",
    "each component has its own lag , but the smoothly varying change in the contribution of each component with energy results in a smooth lag - energy spectrum .",
    "we also find evidence for a disc reflection component responding on this timescale .    on shorter timescales , we would not expect the propagating fluctuations to correlate at all across the spectrum , as the disc and soft excess probably can not vary much intrinsically on these timescales .",
    "the soft lag at these frequencies is therefore interpreted as reprocessing of the intrinsic power - law emission .",
    "we split the frequency band over which the soft lag is seen into two , and find evidence for a change in the lag - energy spectra with frequency .",
    "the high frequency ( hf ) variability appears to show a stronger reprocessing response in the soft excess rather than in the reflected component ; there is no significant lag at iron k@xmath2 seen in the data , but only at energies below 1.2  kev .",
    "the vhf has a lag at iron ( and redward ) energies , but this is accompanied not by the soft excess but by the blackbody .",
    "the hard x - ray emission from the corona is consistent with an origin in inverse - compton scattering .",
    "the downturn below 0.8  kev in the covariance indicates that the source of seed photons is the soft excess ( j13 ) .",
    "this strongly limits the amount of reflection which can contribute to the spectrum below 1  kev .",
    "thus reflection alone is not the only source of lags in this object .",
    "an obvious additional source is thermal reprocessing - the thermalisation of the non - reflected , absorbed emission , which leads to heating of the disc and soft excess regions as they respond to increased illumination .",
    "this could give a physical explanation as to why these components are seen to reverberate along with the reflection component .",
    "however , it is strange that the soft excess emission requires typically longer to respond to the coronal illumination than the blackbody and iron line .",
    "the propagation lags clearly show that the soft excess region lags the blackbody , and under the assumption that these are modulated by the same inwardly propagating fluctuations , is smaller and closer in than the blackbody .",
    "we would expect its reprocessed signature to be more evident at higher frequencies than the blackbody as it is closer to the coronal emission region .",
    "it may be that the region producing the soft excess has little reflected or reprocessed flux ( perhaps because it is too highly ionised ) , but that it responds to the corona via propagation lags on the blackbody disc response .    the hard band psd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lag_plot ] ) shows weaker variability power than the soft band at frequencies below @xmath74hz ( lf ) . at frequencies above @xmath74hz ( hf )",
    "the power in each band is comparable , with the hard showing a slight excess in power .",
    "the hard band shows an obvious excess in power exactly where the vhf soft lag occurs .",
    "the coherence also drops to @xmath14 just above the hf band .",
    "this drop in coherence is most easily explained as due to the ` cross over ' between two independently varying components with quite different energy spectra . at lf and vhf bands , where one component dominates the psd in both bands , the coherence is high since each component",
    "is correlated with itself .",
    "clearly the timing and variability properties of this simple spectrum source are very interesting .",
    "better estimates of the lag - energy and lag - frequency properties , only possible with much longer observations , are needed to fully understand the causal connection between the emission components in this highly promising source .",
    "after the original submission of this manuscript we learnt that the x - ray time lags in pg 1244 + 026 were simultaneously and independently studied by @xcite . that submitted paper focuses on the iron k@xmath2 reverberation lags at low frequencies , whereas this paper has focused on understanding the soft lags , and the time lags observed up to higher frequencies . the data analysis in the two papers",
    "are consistent , with the differences in the lag energy spectra presented in each paper resulting from the choice of reference band .",
    "these two papers highlight the need to better constrain the variability and time delays up to higher frequencies in this source .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for the thorough reading of our manuscript .",
