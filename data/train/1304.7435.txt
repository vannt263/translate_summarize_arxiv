    "@xmath0-@xmath1 fading distribution provides a general multipath model for a line - of - sight ( los ) propagation scenario controlled by two shape parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "some classical fading distributions are included in the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution as particular cases , e.g. one - sided gaussian , rayleigh , and ricean .",
    "in fact , the fitting of the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution to experimental data is better than that achieved by the classical distributions previously mentioned .",
    "a detailed description of the @xmath0-@xmath1 fading model and other related models such as @xmath3-@xmath1 and @xmath4-@xmath1 can be found    shadowing can be introduced in a los multipath fading model in two basic ways . the first way consists on assuming that the total power , associated to both the dominant components and the scattered waves , is subject to random fluctuations .",
    "the second way relies on assuming that only the dominant components are subject to random fluctuations . the first class of composite multipath / shadowing models are named multiplicative shadow fading models , while the second class of models are named los shadow fading models .",
    "the ricean shadowed fading model is a los shadow fading model that assumes the ricean distribution for the multipath fading and the nakagami-@xmath2 distribution for the shadowing .",
    "this model fits to the land mobile satellite ( lms ) channel experimental data @xcite , and recently , it has been shown that provides an excellent experimental fitting to underwater acoustic communications ( uac ) channels @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ricean shadowed fading distribution has good analytical properties and all its basic statistical characterizations are given in closed - form , i.e. the probability density function ( pdf ) and moment generating function ( mgf ) are given in @xcite and the cumulative density function ( cdf ) in @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution includes the ricean distribution as a particular case , a natural generalization of the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution can be obtained by a los shadow fading model with the same multipath / shadowing scheme used in the ricean shadowed model .",
    "this paper investigates this new model , shadowed distribution , so called by analogy with the ricean shadowed distribution .",
    "it is shown in this paper that the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution has three main properties :    * it is motivated by a clear underlying physical model . *",
    "it provides a remarkable unification of popular fading models : one - side gaussian , rayleigh , nakagami-@xmath2 , ricean , @xmath0-@xmath1 and ricean shadowed . *",
    "it has good analytical properties ; its pdf , cdf and mgf are obtained in closed - form .",
    "the statistics of the sum and maximum distributions can also be expressed in closed - form .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the @xmath0-@xmath1",
    "shadowed underlaying physical model is described .",
    "the pdf , cdf and mgf of the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution are derived in , while the sum and maximum distribution are investigated in some applications of this set of statistical results to the performance analysis of wireless communication systems are presented in .",
    "finally , some conclusions are given in",
    "the fading model for the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution relies on a generalization of the physical model corresponding to the @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution we consider a signal structured in clusters of waves which propagates in a nonhomogeneous environment . within each cluster",
    "the multipath waves are assumed to have scattered waves with identical powers and a dominant component with certain arbitrary power .",
    "while the intracluster scattered waves have random phases and similar delay times , the intercluster delay - time spreads are considered relatively large .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath0-@xmath1 model which assumes a deterministic dominant component within each cluster , the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed model assumes that the dominant components of all the clusters can randomly fluctuate as a consequence of shadowing .",
    "from the physical model for the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution , the signal power @xmath5 can be expressed in terms of the in - phase and quadrature components of the fading signal as follows @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a natural number , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are mutually independent gaussian processes with @xmath10=\\e[y_i]=0 $ ] , @xmath11=\\e[y_i^2]=\\sigma^2 $ ] , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are real numbers , and @xmath14 is a random variable with shaping and @xmath15=1 $ ] .",
    "the interpretation of ( [ model ] ) is the following .",
    "each multipath cluster is modelled by one term of the sum ; thus , @xmath7 is the number of multipath clusters .",
    "the scattered components of the @xmath16th cluster are represented by the circularly symmetric complex gaussian random variable @xmath17 . for each cluster",
    "the total power of the scattered components the dominant component of the @xmath16th cluster is a complex random variable given by @xmath18 ; thus , its power is given by @xmath19 .",
    "all the dominant components are subject to the same common shadowing fluctuation , represented by the power normalized random amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "this section includes the derivation of the pdf , cdf and mgf of the @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed distribution . for the sake of brevity , both the distribution of the signal envelope and the distribution of the signal power ( or equivalently the instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ) will be named @xmath0-@xmath1 shadowed ; both distributions are connected by a quadratic transformation .    the model represented in ( [ model ] ) implies that the conditional probability of the signal power @xmath5 given the shadowing amplitude @xmath14 follows a @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution with pdf @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the mean power of the dominant components and @xmath22 is the modified bessel function of the first kind @xcite . as noted in [ 1 ] , the natural number of can be replaced in ( [ pdf1 ] ) by the nonnegative real extension @xmath1 , resulting in a more general and flexible distribution .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is then defined as @xmath23 and can be interpreted , when @xmath1 is a natural number , as the ratio between the total power of the dominant components and the total power of the scattered waves . in many practical analyses ,",
