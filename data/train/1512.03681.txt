    "indeed , if @xmath115 is the second fundamental form , the gauss equations imply that @xmath116 at every @xmath117 .",
    "hence , in the connected subset @xmath118 intersected with the unit circle all points have distance at most @xmath119 .",
    "this implies that this set lies in the first quadrant with respect to some orthonormal basis @xmath103 , while it lies in its interior if it has positive sectional curvature .",
    "we thus have the shape operators @xmath120 since @xmath121 .    by the gauss equations we have @xmath122 , and hence @xmath123 ( and @xmath124 if the sectional curvature is positive ) .",
    "furthermore , the cone of shape operators which are positive semidefinite contains the first quadrant , while the cone of shape operators which are negative semidefinite contains the third .",
    "we will see that the interesting immersions are quite rigid as a consequence of the following purely algebraic key result which will be applied to the shape operators in .",

    "first , observe that the lemma follows easily if one of the operators is nonsingular . indeed ,",
    "if , say , @xmath105 is invertible , @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the characteristic polynomial of the positive semidefinite operator @xmath132 .",
    "since all the coefficients of @xmath131 are nonnegative the inequality holds , with equality if and only if @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , we can assume that both @xmath104 and @xmath105 are singular .",
    "let @xmath134 , and decompose @xmath104 as its block endomorphisms @xmath135 , according to the orthogonal decomposition @xmath136 , @xmath137 since @xmath138 , we have @xmath139 and @xmath140 .    for @xmath141",

    "if we call @xmath148 the symmetric operator @xmath105 restricted and projected to @xmath149 , then @xmath150 and , for all @xmath151 , @xmath152 thus , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the symmetric operator on @xmath149 given by @xmath155 .",
    "now , observe that  @xmath154 is nonnegative since @xmath156 this gives the inequality in the lemma as in the nonsingular case .",
    "moreover , this computation also shows that @xmath157 if and only if @xmath158 .",

    "@xmath162 , as claimed .",
    "the converse of the equality case is straightforward .",
    "since @xmath123 we can use the following rigidity result , where @xmath163 denotes the lie algebra of the holonomy group of @xmath164 ( see theorem 1.13 in @xcite ) :    [ rigidity ] if @xmath164 is a compact and simply connected riemannian manifold with @xmath123 , then one of the following holds :    * @xmath165 and @xmath164 is diffeomorphic to @xmath12 , with the ricci flow converging to a metric with constant positive curvature ; * @xmath166 and @xmath164 is diffeomorphic to @xmath167 , with the ricci flow converging to the fubini study metric ; * @xmath164 is isometric to an irreducible symmetric space @xmath168 with @xmath169 ; * arbitrary isometric products of the above cases .",

    "in this section we provide the proof of theorem  [ a ] . in the process , we reprove , simplify and strengthen known results about compact euclidean submanifolds in codimension 2 with nonnegative sectional curvature by using proposition  [ rigidity ] . along the way",
    ", we will see how the proof implies further rigidity of the immersion .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath11 be as in theorem  [ a ] . since @xmath11 is compact with nonnegative sectional curvature , a well - known consequence of the cheeger ",
    "gromoll splitting theorem , see @xcite theorem c , implies that its universal cover @xmath180 splits isometrically as @xmath181 where @xmath182 is compact and simply connected .",
    "since the lie algebra of the holonomy group of @xmath164 and @xmath183 coincide , proposition  [ bishop ] implies that @xmath184 .",
    "now observe that in our context @xmath173 and @xmath185 is not possible in proposition  [ bishop ] since then the universal cover would be compact , and by proposition  [ rigidity ] diffeomorphic to @xmath186 . but @xmath186 does not admit an immersion in @xmath187 as follows , e.g. , from @xmath188 , the product formula for pontrjagin classes , and @xmath189 for the normal 2 plane bundle  @xmath190 of the immersion .    therefore , the existence of an isometric immersion implies that @xmath191 for  some @xmath176 $ ] .",
    "we can now combine , and proposition  [ rigidity ] .",
    "first , it follows that @xmath184 and @xmath192 if and only if @xmath178 .    if @xmath193 , then @xmath180 is compact and hence diffeomorphic to @xmath12 , while if @xmath194 and @xmath195 , then @xmath180 is diffeomorphic to @xmath13 . in the latter case , by @xcite the immersion must be a product immersion of convex hypersurfaces and , in particular , @xmath11 itself is simply connected and diffeomorphic to @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath196 , and hence @xmath179 , implies that @xmath180 splits isometrically @xmath197 , with @xmath43 compact and simply connected .",
    "but then @xmath198 , and again by proposition  [ rigidity ] we get that @xmath43 is diffeomorphic to @xmath199 .",
    "thus @xmath200 isometrically , with @xmath201 a discrete group acting by isometries .",
    "we will see in [ z ] below that @xmath202 and that @xmath11 is diffeomorphic to either @xmath19 if @xmath11 is orientable , or to the nonorientable quotient @xmath20 otherwise .    to conclude the proof of theorem  [ a ] , it remains to study the possibilities for the fundamental group when @xmath193 and @xmath203 , or when @xmath196 and @xmath204 for some metrics of nonnegative curvature on the spheres . in order to do this",
    ", we first recall the relationship , due to kuiper , between height functions and shape operators of compact euclidean submanifolds .    following @xcite , for each @xmath205 consider the height function @xmath92 and define @xmath206 and @xmath207 since on a set of full measure the height functions are nondegenerate",
    ", we can apply the usual morse inequalities for morse functions . after integrating them",
    "we get @xmath208 and @xmath209 where @xmath210 for some field @xmath211 .",
    "clearly , @xmath212 is a critical point of @xmath94 if and only if @xmath213 for some @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the normal bundle of the immersion .",
    "moreover , @xmath212 is a nondegenerate critical point of @xmath216 if and only if @xmath217 is nonsingular , and the index of the critical point is equal to @xmath218 , the number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath217 .",
    "we now use the gauss map @xmath219 with @xmath220 , which for compact submanifolds is surjective .",
    "since @xmath221 , we have that @xmath212 is a nondegenerate critical point of @xmath216 if and only if @xmath222 is a regular point of @xmath223 .",
    "thus if @xmath224 is the set of regular values of @xmath223 ( an open and dense set of full measure ) , then @xmath94 with @xmath225 is a morse function and hence @xmath226 is constant on every connected component of @xmath227 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath225 , the set @xmath228 contains @xmath93 many points of index @xmath95 .",
    "thus by change of variables , @xmath229 since @xmath230 , we also have @xmath231 for all @xmath95 .",
    "we proceed by applying lemma  [ l : eq ] to the shape operators @xmath232 in in order to estimate @xmath233 for @xmath214 , by first integrating over a circle in the normal space @xmath234 , and then over @xmath117 . for a fixed normal space @xmath234 , lemma  [ l : eq ] implies that @xmath235 furthermore , if a regular value @xmath236 lies in the first quadrant , then , and if it lies in the third quadrant then @xmath237 , whereas all saddle points ( and possibly some local maxima and minima as well ) lie in the second and fourth quadrants .",
    "thus , together with @xmath231 , implies that @xmath238    as we will see , in the case of strict inequality @xmath164 is diffeomorphic to a sphere .",
    "we are thus interested from now on in the equality case , where one expects a certain amount of rigidity .",
    "this motivates our next key definition .",
    "_ definition .",
    "_ given a compact riemannian manifold @xmath11 with nonnegative sectional curvature , an isometric immersion @xmath9 is said to be _ wide _ if @xmath239 .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath133 at some point , then @xmath105 is nonsingular , and hence in a neighborhood of the point as well .",
    "but then this neighborhood will not have any saddle points , and we would have a strict inequality in .    notice that , along the ( open ) set where the first case holds , the orthonormal basis @xmath103 in , and hence @xmath104 and @xmath105 , are unique and thus smooth . on the other hand , no such information can be obtained in the second case .",
    "altogether , we have the following improvement of a result in @xcite , where we obtain additional information on the structure of the immersion .    [ main ] if @xmath11 is compact , nonnegatively curved and immersed in euclidean space in codimension @xmath247 , then we have for any coefficient field @xmath211 over which @xmath11 is orientable that @xmath248 with equality if and only if @xmath249 in particular , equality implies that the immersion is wide .    by the morse inequalities",
    "@xmath250 for @xmath251 and @xmath252 , i.e. @xmath253 . if @xmath11 is compact and orientable mod @xmath211 , then @xmath254 and , in general , @xmath255 .",
    "hence , @xmath256 which together with yields @xmath257 with equality as claimed .",
    "so far we have shown that there are three situations : either @xmath258 diffeomorphically , or @xmath259 splits isometrically as either @xmath260 or @xmath261 , for certain metrics of nonnegative curvature on the spheres . as a corollary of proposition  [ main ] , we conclude that in the first case @xmath164 itself is a sphere when @xmath262 :    [ sn ] if @xmath263 and @xmath264 is finite , then @xmath11 is simply connected . in particular",

    "assume @xmath11 is not simply connected , and let @xmath266 be an element of prime order @xmath267 , so @xmath268 .",
    "then , the lens space @xmath269 is a finite cover of @xmath11 and with the covering metric it has an isometric immersion into @xmath28 .",
    "but @xmath270 for all @xmath95 which contradicts proposition  [ main ] if @xmath262 .",

    "@xcite implies that the immersion is a product of two convex hypersurfaces .",
    "one easily sees that in this case the immersion is wide .    for the three dimensional case",
    "we have the following .    [ lens ] if @xmath273 and @xmath274 is finite , then @xmath4 is diffeomorphic to a lens space @xmath23 , and the immersion is wide with @xmath275 . furthermore , the height functions satisfy @xmath276 as well as @xmath277 .",
    "@xmath4 is again covered by a lens space with @xmath278 and we have equality in proposition  [ main ] , which implies that @xmath275 ( they do not have to be @xmath279 , though ) .",

    "we get @xmath285 for a.e .",
    "@xmath286 . therefore for almost all @xmath286 the morse function @xmath94 has the same number of critical points of index 0 and 1 ( first for the lens space , and then for @xmath4 as well ) .",
    "but if this is the case , the cancellation result in @xcite says that there exists another ( abstract ) morse function on @xmath4 with only one critical point of index 0 and 1 .",
    "in particular , this means that @xmath4 is a cw complex whose 1 skeleton is a circle , which implies by transversality that the map @xmath287 induced by the inclusion is onto and hence @xmath288 is finite cyclic .    for infinite fundamental group",
    ", we have :    [ z ] if @xmath264 is infinite , then @xmath289 is also cyclic .",

    "thus @xmath299 , and we can apply proposition  [ main ] to the induced immersion of @xmath300 . as in the proof of [ lens ] , it follows that for the height functions on @xmath300 we have @xmath283 and @xmath301 for a.e .",
    "the same thus holds for the height functions of the immersion of @xmath11 , and again as in the proof of [ lens ] , we see that @xmath302 is cyclic , hence @xmath201 is isomorphic to @xmath42",
