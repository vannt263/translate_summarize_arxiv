    "346 x - ray sources are identified .",
    "cdfs has become one of best - studied fields in the sky , and its importance increases significantly with the goods observations @xcite and the hubble ultra deep field ( udf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to reveal the nature and properties of these faint x - ray sources , extensive follow - up observations",
    "have been made in many wavelength bands .",
    "spectroscopic observations with the vlt and the fors instrument @xcite have yielded 168 spectra , of which 137 have reliable redshifts .",
    "in the mean time , deep imaging observations have been made with the eso vlt and ntt in eight bands : u , b , v , r , i , j , h and k@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the hst images taken by the goods team provide high - quality photometry and source morphology .",
    "these observations reach significantly deeper than the spectroscopic observations , therefore yield an essential multi - band database for deriving reliable photometric redshifts for the x - ray sources .",
    "they also provide two additional bands : the acs / f850lp ( z - band ) and wfpc2/f300w ( near - uv band ) .",
    "while x - ray sources account for only a small fraction of the field galaxies , they form a special group with distinct properties .",
    "the ultra deep survey @xcite indicates that the majority of x - ray sources are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "type - i agn are characterized with broad emission lines and an underlying power - law continuum , and the type - ii agn exhibit prominent narrow emission lines .",
    "the combined results of cdfs and chandra deep field north @xcite further confirm that they are consistent with an assumption that obscured agn ( type - ii ) outnumber normal , unobscured ( type - i ) agn by a factor of approximately 4 - 10 .",
    "a key parameter of these extremely faint x - ray sources is their redshifts , which may be determined spectroscopically or photometrically .",
    "the spectral - energy - distribution ( sed ) method of redshift estimation ( photometric redshift , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) uses a library of sed templates of galaxies at varying redshifts to fit the observed broadband data with a minimization of @xmath8 .",
    "the most prominent feature in these templates is a balmer break around 4000   in the rest frame , because of the thermal nature of the galaxy continuum . at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) ,",
    "intergalactic absorption shortward of ly@xmath10   produces a significant break at @xmath11  .",
    "these breaks or other strong spectral features can leave a distinctive signature across the range of passbands , making it possible to determine reasonable redshift estimates .",
    "simulations and observations have demonstrated that photometric redshifts can be accurate on the order of 10% for most sources .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) uses five - band color selection to find quasars , galaxies and other sources @xcite .",
    "photometric redshift estimation is an extension of such color selection techniques , and it has gained popularity in recent years as deep imaging surveys become one of the most important methods in probing the early universe @xcite .",
    "the majority of sources in these fields are so faint that it is impractical to obtain their spectra in large number .",
    "redshift information used in conjunction with the optical , uv , ir , and x - ray photometry is central in determining the nature of faint x - ray sources and how they are linked to the galaxy population at similar redshift .",
    "also , we can explore how the luminosity function of x - ray galaxies differs from that of other galaxies .",
    "a number of studies have been carried out to compare photometric and spectroscopic redshifts @xcite for x - ray sources .",
    "a study of similar scope @xcite finds that the photometric redshifts are within 25% of the spectroscopic redshifts for 94% of the non - broad - line sources with both photometric and spectroscopic measurements .    in this paper , we focus on refining our photometric redshift techniques on an x - ray selected sample of sources and testing our results against current model predictions .",
    "our redshift estimates are based on public imaging data in the near - uv ( nuv ,  3000 ) , optical and infrared bands .",
    "the results will facilitate our understanding of the broadband properties , luminosity function of x - ray sources and many other important issues such as clustering and the large - scale structure of the early universe .",
    "we discuss the data resources and processing in  2 . in ",
    "3 we discuss the application of several methods of photometric redshift and compare their results to derive the most probable redshifts . with the photometric redshifts for all cdfs sources , we discuss in  4 the redshift dependence of source properties and potential implications .",
    "our sample is the 346 x - ray sources identified from the 940 ksec of cdfs data @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we use ab magnitudes , and we calculate the x - ray magnitudes as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is flux in units of , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 hz for the soft x - ray band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and hard x - ray band ( 2 - 10 kev ) , respectively . for sources not detected in one of the x - ray bands , we derive the upper limits to x - ray magnitudes . in this calculation",
    ", we consider the limiting magnitude for the soft and hard - x - ray as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "approximately 85% of these x - ray sources have been identified in the optical r - band images of eso vlt / fors @xcite .",
    "the eso / fors r - band images cover most of the cdfs field to a limiting magnitude of @xmath19 .",
    "supplementary positions are added from the comparison with the eso imaging survey ( eis , * ? ? ?",
    "the eis images and catalogues also provide multiband information .",
    "only objects that fall with 5  from the x - ray positions are selected .",
    "each entry in the catalogs is compared with the x - ray positions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 limiting magnitudes of the eis data are u=25.7 , b=26.4 , v=25.4 , r=25.5 , i=24.7 , j=23.4 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the vlt / goods imaging data in j , h , and k@xmath7 bands reach limiting magnitudes of @xmath22 .",
    "uncertainties of the optical zero point are in the range of 0.03 - 0.08 . as our comparison of the measurements from different data indicates , real uncertainties may be larger than tabulated values .",
    "we therefore assign uniform errors of 0.1 magnitudes for most data points unless the tabulated errors are larger than 0.1 . as shown in figure 1 and table 1 , the majority of the optical counterparts lie with 2  from the x - ray position , ( and within 1  from the optical position given in @xcite ) .",
    "additional data are obtained from the combo-17 survey @xcite in its most sensitive broad bands and from the goods images .",
    "the combo-17 data of the cdfs consist of catalogs in three broad bands ( b , v and r ) , with limiting magnitudes of @xmath23 .",
    "the photometric redshift of 272 matched x - ray sources are available . in combo-17",
    "every object is either classified as a star , a galaxy or a quasar , and in the latter two cases redshifts are determined .",
    "combo-17 , because its significantly higher number of bands , provides more reliable redshift estimations , particularly for those with emission lines . a comparison between the combo-17 results and spectroscopic redshift yields an average error of @xmath24 @xcite , better than that of our broad - band results ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , its advantage is limited to relatively bright sources ( @xmath25 ) and redshift below 1.5 or above 2.5 .",
    "the optical goods data @xcite are taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board of  and filters f435w , f606w , f775w , and f850lp ( b , v , i , and z band , respectively ) .",
    "these data reach magnitudes of @xmath26 , therefore providing additional significant resources .",
    "the processed acs data images and catalogs , including the udf , are retrieved from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) .",
    "we use the _ sextractor _ algorithm @xcite to identify sources . since the hst data have significantly higher spatial resolution , we sum all the source fluxes within 0.5 from the optical positions in the eis data , in order to match its photometry .",
    "additional source positions are obtained for those that are not detected in either the eis or fors - r data . in total",
    ", data of 69 sources are added to the eis database .",
    "to obtain reliable colors for our sources the spread in seeing conditions for images in different wavebands has to be taken into account .",
    "we have computed corrected magnitudes according to the following strategy : 1 ) we computed magnitudes in apertures of 2  in each waveband using the available images ( `` original '' images ) ; 2 ) we degraded the point spread function ( psf ) of each image to match the worst condition ( `` degraded '' images ) ; 3 ) we recomputed the magnitudes in apertures of 2  using the `` degraded '' images ; and 4 ) we derived corrections for the different seeing conditions comparing , for stellar `` bright '' objects , magnitudes in the original and in the `` degraded '' images and applied these corrections to the `` original '' magnitudes .",
    "the goods data also include the band of wfpc2 f300w , which provides clues that complement the optical data . in the low - redshift range ,",
    "these data enable the separation of power - law continua from thermal components . at @xmath27",
    ", the data may reveal the signature of prominent ly@xmath10   emission .",
    "we obtain the processed images from mast and use iraf tasks to reject cosmic ray events and stack the images .",
    "a total of 112 stacked field images are produced , and each of them contains at least three independent wfpc2 images .",
    "we use _ sextractor _ to identify sources from the stacked images .",
    "the limiting magnitude in this band varies with the number of stacked images .",
    "the average @xmath20 limiting magnitude is @xmath23 .",
    "105 sources have detection in the nuv band , and 123 are confirmed with no detection .    in all , 191 sources have data in all ten bands : nuv , u , b , v , r , i , z , j , h , and k@xmath7 .",
    "326 sources have data in seven or more broad bands between u and k@xmath7 , 15 other sources have five or six bands of data .",
    "14 sources have no infrared data .",
    "there are four objects which do not have detections in addition to the fors - r results @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of selected x - ray sources were carried out in 2000 and 2001 , with the vlt telescope and fors instrument .",
    "details of the observations and data reduction may be found in @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts for 137 objects provide a critical source for our verifications , and the data also allow us to distinguish between broad - line and narrow - line objects . because of the low spectroscopic resolution ( @xmath28 ) , the classification of sources is tentative . as defined in @xcite , objects with emission lines of @xmath29  are considered as type - i agn .",
    "such a definition based on the opticaal spectroscopy is largely consistent with the classification by x - ray data ( see  3.2 and fig .",
    "3 ) , but a few exceptions do exist . approximately twenty spectroscopic redshifts are derived from the sources fainter than the nominal limiting magnitudes of @xmath30 . these values are considered reliable because of the sources prominent emission - line features .",
    "we calculate photometric redshifts using two parallel models : hyperz @xcite and the bayesian model ( bpz , * ? ? ?",
    "the results are dependent on the selection of model templates .",
    "using spectroscopic redshifts to check the reliability of the derived photometric redshifts , we are able to choose the galaxy templates that best suit",
    ". for hyperz , our sample of x - ray sources include starburst galaxies , e , s0 , sbc , scd , and i m galaxies from @xcite and the gissel98 library @xcite .",
    "the bpz model combines the @xmath8 minimization and bayesian marginalization , using relevant knowledge , such as the expected shape of the redshift distributions and the galaxy type fractions .",
    "we use the default library in the bpz , which is similar to hyperz but includes additional templates of starburst galaxies , and a set of flat spectra .    both the hyperz and bpz models provide accurate fits for approximately 85% of the objects , however , there are a number of objects whose fitted redshifts are different from the known spectroscopic values .",
    "most of these sources are type - i agn , which are known for their power - law spectra with prominent broad emission lines .",
    "failure to detect strong broad lines in the passbands is the most likely cause for poor fits . even in the broadband data",
    ", their difference may be significant . in figure 2",
    "we plot three representative sets of broadband data , plus the sdss composite spectrum as a representation of type - i agn and quasars @xcite .    between approximately 1200 and 5000 ",
    "the underlying continuum may be described by a single power law .",
    "however , the sdss composite spectrum itself does not fit all the type - i agn .",
    "some type - i agn show relatively weak emission lines , and their continuum is dominated by a thermal continuum of the underlying galaxy , instead of a power law .",
    "we therefore generate a set of agn spectra by combining a continuum component and emission - line components .",
    "the continuum is a broken power law .",
    "we assume a power law of @xmath31 , with @xmath10 varying between 0 and 1 .",
    "longward of 5000   we add another power - law component of @xmath32 to represent the contribution of the host galaxy , and a thermal component in the infrared band @xcite . the line components have the same ratios as those derived in @xcite , but the line intensities vary .",
    "the ly@xmath10  equivalent ( and other lines accordingly ) is scaled by factors between 0.5 and 5.0 from their nominal values in the composite quasar spectrum @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath10 intensity is derived from the h@xmath33 value , scaled up by a factor of three .",
    "running photometric - redshift tasks with two sets of templates of galaxies and power - laws , we test the results with objects with known spectroscopic redshifts . while hyperz can pickup the majority of type - i objects by the lower @xmath8 values in the fitting output , it identifies @xmath34 of them as galaxies .",
    "future work of improving the power - law templates and/or selective choice of galaxy templates may be needed . however",
    ", this uncertainty may be alleviated using the additional information in the x - ray bands . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the x - ray properties are indicative of object types .",
    "we pre - divide our sample into three groups based on their x - ray properties :    * type - i agn : @xmath35 or and @xmath36 .",
    "power - law templates ; * type - ii agn : @xmath37 . galaxy templates ; * galaxies : @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",
    "galaxy templates .",
    "the groups are established primarily by their x - ray hardness ratio and the x - ray - optical flux ratio , not on the broadband optical and infrared data . as shown in figure 3@xmath39 and 3@xmath40 ,",
    "nearly all type - ii agn have x - ray magnitude difference @xmath35 .",
    "this parameter can also be interpreted as the hardness ratio ( h - s)/(h+s ) @xmath41 , where h and s are the counts in the hard ( 2 - 10 kev ) and soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) bands , respectively .",
    "in addition , most galaxies are weaker emitter in the hard x - ray band , at @xmath38 , where @xmath42 is the optical r - band magnitude .",
    "once the initial separations are made , we manually check the broadband color of each object .",
    "these selections are applied before our photometric - redshift estimations .",
    "the estimations for type - ii agn and galaxies are made using the templates in hyperz and bpz , as their continuum features are primarily thermal . for type - i agn",
    ", we use our power - law templates and the hyperz task , which allows a large number of templates . to check whether the results is overly dominated by one single band",
    ", we also run the datasets with and without the bluest band .",
    "this is one of the criteria used in the final determination of redshifts .",
    "the source classification in table 1 represents our best results : for the 137 objects where reliable redshifts are established , we use their broad - line properties to classify them . for the others",
    ", we use the combo-17 results .",
    "if sources are not in the combo-17 catalog , we use their x - ray properties to classify them . in a few cases when we have reasons to believe as exceptions , we discuss them in  4.3 .",
    "there are several sources of uncertainties and discrepancies in our redshift estimations : ( 1 ) source confusion : deep optical images often reveal multiple sources within the x - ray positional error circle .",
    "many factors , such as the x - ray brightness and optical morphology , need to be considered before a careful decision may be made .",
    "( 2 ) complicated source energy distributions : some x - ray sources have hybrid continuum shape , as the combination of a thermal component and a power law .",
    "our model templates may not be sophisticated enough to reach the best and unique fits ; and ( 3 ) faintness of some sources : when the magnitudes are close to the detection limit , the task do poorly in distinguishing the balmer and lyman breaks .",
    "the results are cross - compared between hyperz and bpz .",
    "our main concern is potential catastrophic errors between redshift @xmath43 and that of @xmath44 , which arise from the confusion between the balmer continuum break and lyman-@xmath10 break . in such cases ,",
    "the x - ray properties provide additional discriminators for the estimates of redshift .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , approximately 90% of the redshift values derived from bpz and hyperz match well .",
    "their photometric redshifts and errors are calculated as the weighted average of bpz and hyperz .",
    "the weights are taken as the reciprocal of redshift errors , averaged over the lower and higher sides .",
    "both bpz and hyperz output the confidence levels of photometric redshifts , which we use to calculate the errors in redshift .",
    "the new 95% confidence level of photometric redshift is calculated from the weighted average of errors , respectively , on the lower and higher redshift side . with such a method ,",
    "the redshift values with narrower redshift range are given with more weights .",
    "several pairs of seemingly discrepant redshifts are compromised as they converge towards the values with narrower redshift ranges .",
    "several combo-17 redshifts do not have published error values @xcite .",
    "we use the errors in the pairing bpz or hpz redshifts .",
    "discrepant redshifts in approximately 15 sources are likely the results from ( 1 ) faint sources for which the uncertainties rise ; and ( 2 ) some sources with power - law continua , for which the hyperz evaluation is more reliable because of the added agn templates .",
    "nearly all the hard x - ray sources as well as the objects with large r - k colors are at lower redshifts ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "figure 5 compares photometric and spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the average dispersion @xmath46 is 0.08 .",
    "we run a similar test for bpz and hyperz values .",
    "the dispersion is 0.08 for hyperz values , and 0.10 for bpz .",
    "we assign quality indices to every source , from 0 to 3 . with quality index 3 ,",
    "the spectroscopic redshift is certain , and so is the optical counterpart .",
    "it corresponds to quality index 2 + and higher in @xcite .",
    "index 2 means a secure spectroscopic redshift , but the optical counterpart is uncertain .",
    "other index values are assigned with multiple factors , such as the combo-17 ( 0.4 ) , bpz ( 0.3 ) , hyperz ( 0.2 ) , and single - line redshifts ( 1.0 ) .",
    "the index values of 1 or smaller can be additive , e.g. if we have a single - line spectroscopic redshift , for which all three photo - z results agree , q=1.9 . the grading in photo - z does not mean to indicate a quality flag between bpz and hyperz .",
    "our main results are presented in table 1 .",
    "three objects are marked with quality index of 0.2 . in two such cases ,",
    "a power - law continuum is apparent , and their fitting results with hyperz must be specially chosen . in another case ,",
    "the hyperz values are supported by the x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "two objects are marked with quality index of 0.3 .",
    "it is very faint and are detected only in a few bands , leading to confusion between ly@xmath10  and balmer breaks . in such cases , the bpz values are chosen .",
    "based on the redshift information , we are able to fine tune the classification in  3.2 and further divide the three groups into seven :    * galaxy : @xmath47  with hardness ratio @xmath48 . * type-2 agn : @xmath49  and the hardness ratio @xmath50 .",

    "the latter are derived from the combination of bpz and hyperz , as described above .",
    "the redshift dispersion between these two samples is approximately 12% .",
    "the high quality of the  images enables us to resolve many x - ray sources .",
    "we find that approximately forty sources show significant sub - arcsecond structure , _",
    "i.e. _ two or more components with flux contrast less than 10 .",
    "they are marked in table 1 ( in column `` offset '' ) .",

    "three such sources show considerable color difference between bands , therefore implying discrepant redshifts .",
    "several sources show sub - arcsecond components of different colors .",

    "component b is brighter in the z band .",
    "the properties of a number of peculiar sources also need some discussions : are discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we discuss several other sources :    cdfs 38 and 100 : the broad - band data of these two objects exhibit a power - law continuum without signs of emission lines .",

    "no redshift information can be derived from these single - band detections .",
    "furthermore , these sources are among the faintest in both the x - ray and optical bands .",
    "it is therefore possible that their detections may not be highly reliable .",
    "approximately 95% of the x - ray sources have infrared data . to test their effect on photometric redshifts , we run the tasks with only the optical bands .",
    "the average accuracy in redshift is reduced from @xmath1 to @xmath61 .",

    "the impact of infrared data is not so significant .",

    "if we establish a subgroup whose r - band magnitudes are within 1.5 magnitudes to the detection limit , the number of outliers increase significantly .",
    "this dependence on sensitivity may be from the same reason as stated above : near the detection limit , the tasks may not distinguish balmer breaks from ly@xmath10  breaks .    as discussed in  4.1 , the dispersion of hyperz results , as compared with spectroscopic redshifts , is slightly smaller than that for bpz , this may be understood as our hyperz fitting includes a large grid of simulated agn-1 spectra , while the bpz fitting uses only its built - in galaxy templates .",

    "our results are consistent with that derived from the spectroscopic redshifts ( fig .",
    "22 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , offering encouraging evidence that , with careful calibration , photometric redshifts are a reliable resource for the statistical study of distant sources . the redshift values in this paper have found their application in a recent study of the x - ray luminosity function @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure 10 , there is significant evolution with redshift of x - ray and optical / near - ir colors .",
    "the hardness ratio declines with redshift .",
    "this is consistent with the finding of @xcite that most hard x - ray sources are at redshift lower than 1.5 . while it is possible that a part of the observed trend may be the result of increasing luminosity threshold with redshift , the effect may not account for all the changes , as they are found in sources whose fluxes are well above the detection thresholds . at higher redshifts ,",
    "a part of the hard xray flux is shifted into the soft x - ray band , thus reducing the hardness ratio .",
    "this effect may also explain the change in the u - k color : at higher redshifts , the k - band data represent only the data at the restframe wavelength @xmath69 m , since the reddening effect becomes significantly lessened .",
    "the change in the u - k color is mainly due to a simple redshift effect : at higher redshifts , the k - band data represent only the data at the restframe wavelength @xmath70 m , since the reddening effect becomes significantly lessened .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , different types of x - ray sources are separated in the plot of x - ray hardness ratio vs. x - ray luminosity .",
    "figure 11 demonstrates the same trend , with a significantly higher number of sources .",
    "we plot the relationship for both the hard- and soft - x - ray luminosities .",
    "many galaxies are not detected in the hard x - ray band .",
    "we utilize a photometric redshift estimation using 12-band data in near - uv , optical , infrared and x - ray .",
    "we employ a set of power - law models for type - i agn and various models of galaxies , to derive the photometric redshifts for 342 cdfs sources .",
    "a comparison with the spectroscopic redshift of 137 objects suggests an average accuracy of approximately 8% .",
    "our results well match that of combo-17 .",
    "these encouraging results suggest that photometric redshifts are of significant accuracy .",
    "the redshifts of cdfs sources subtend a broad range between 0.01 to 4.66 .",
    "the hard x - ray sources , mostly type - ii agn , are mainly populated at @xmath63 .",
    "the sources with power - law continuum , _",
    "i.e. _ type - i agn , show less redshift dependence .",
    "observations have been carried out using the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) and the 2.2 m telescope at the la silla observatory under program - id nos .",

    "<S> based on the photometry of 10 near - uv , optical , and near - infrared bands of the chandra deep field south , we estimate the photometric redshifts for 342 x - ray sources , which constitute @xmath0 of all the detected x - ray sources in the field . </S>",
    "<S> the models of spectral energy distribution are based on galaxies and a combination of power - law continuum and emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> color information is useful for source classifications : type - i agn show non - thermal spectral features that are distinctive from galaxies and type - ii agn . </S>",
    "<S> the hardness ratio in x - ray and the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio are also useful discriminators . using rudimentary color separation techniques , we are able to further refine our photometric redshift estimations . among these sources , </S>",
    "<S> 137 have reliable spectroscopic redshifts , which we use to verify the accuracy of photometric redshifts and to modify the model inputs . </S>",
    "<S> the average relative dispersion in redshift distribution is @xmath1 , among the most accurate for photometric surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the high reliability of our results is attributable to the high quality and broad coverage of data as well as the applications of several independent methods and a careful evaluation of every source . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our redshift estimations to study the effect of redshift on broadband colors and to study the redshift distribution of agn . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that both the hardness ratio and u - k color decline with redshift , which may be the result of a k - correction . </S>",
    "<S> the number of type - ii agn declines significantly at @xmath2 and that of galaxies declines at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the distribution of type - i agn exhibits less redshift dependence . </S>",
    "<S> as well , we observe a significant peak in the redshift distribution at z=0.6 . we demonstrate that our photometric redshift estimation produces a reliable database for the study of x - ray luminosity of galaxies and agn . </S>"
