    "a very fruitful information on the dynamics can be gained from the study of periodic orbits  @xcite .",
    "first , because these particular orbits are generically almost everywhere in phase space , and second because they can be computed easily , i.e.  with some short integration time .",
    "these periodic orbits together with their stability organize locally the dynamics .",
    "it is then natural to consider them as a cornerstone of control strategies .",
    "for instance , in order to create invariant tori of hamiltonian systems , cary and hanson  @xcite proposed a method based on the computation of an indicator of the linear stability of a set of periodic orbits , namely greene s residue  @xcite .",
    "it provides an algorithm to find the appropriate values of some pre - defined parameters in order to reconstruct invariant tori by vanishing some selected residues .",
    "first developed for two - dimensional symplectic maps , it has been extended to four dimensional symplectic maps , and has been applied to stellarators  @xcite ( where periodic orbits are closed magnetic field lines ) and particle accelerators  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we review and extend this residue method .",
    "the aim is to tune appropriately the parameters of the system such that appropriate bifurcations occur .",
    "it is well - known in the literature that local bifurcations occur when the tangent map associated with the poincar map obtained by a transversal intersection of the flow , has an eigenvalue which is a root of the unity . in particular",
    ", periodic orbits can lose their stability in case of multiple eigenvalues on the unit circle , i.e.  when these eigenvalues are equal to 1 or @xmath0 for two - dimensional symplectic maps .",
    "therefore it is natural to consider greene s residues as a way to locate those bifurcations . in this context ,",
    "vanishing residues indicate the specific values of the parameters where significant change occurs in the system and hence will be the basis for the reduction of chaos ( by creation of invariant tori ) as in refs .",
    "@xcite but also for the destruction of regular structures .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we review some basic notions on periodic orbits of hamiltonian systems and their stability , and we explain the details of the residue method .",
    "we give the condition on the residues of a pair of birkhoff periodic orbits to create an invariant torus in their vicinity , and a similar condition which leads to a destruction of nearby invariant tori . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we apply this method to the destruction and creation of librational and rotational invariant tori of a particular hamiltonian system , a forced pendulum with two interacting primary resonances , used as a paradigm for the transition to hamiltonian chaos .",
    "we consider an autonomous hamiltonian flow with two degrees of freedom which depends on a set of parameters denoted @xmath1  : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath5 being the two - dimensional identity matrix . in order to determine the periodic orbits of this flow and their linear stability properties , we also consider the tangent flow written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the hessian matrix ( composed by second derivatives of @xmath9 with respect to its canonical variables ) . for a given periodic orbit with period @xmath10 ,",
    "the spectrum of the monodromy matrix @xmath11 gives its linear stability property .",
    "as the flow is volume preserving , the determinant of such a matrix is equal to 1 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath12 is an eigenvalue , so are @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . as the orbit is periodic , @xmath16 is an eigenvalue with an eigenvector in the direction of the flow .",
    "its associated eigenspace is at least of dimension 2 since there is another eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 coming from the conserved quantity @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , according to the remark above , the orbit is elliptic if the spectrum of @xmath11 is @xmath18 ( and stable , except at some particular values ) , or hyperbolic if the spectrum is @xmath19 with @xmath20 ( unstable ) .",
    "the intermediate case is when the spectrum is restricted to @xmath21 or @xmath0 and the orbit is called parabolic . whether or not the parabolic periodic orbit is stable depends on higher order terms . in a more concise form",
    ", the above cases can be summarized using greene s definition of a residue which led to a criterion on the existence of invariant tori  @xcite  : @xmath22 we notice that the 4 ( instead of 2 for 2d maps ) in the numerator comes from the two additional eigenvalues 1 coming from autonomous hamiltonian flows . if @xmath230,1[$ ] , the periodic orbit is elliptic ; if @xmath24 or @xmath25 it is hyperbolic ; and if @xmath26 and @xmath27 , it is parabolic and higher order expansions give the stability of such periodic orbits .",
    "since the periodic orbit and its stability depend on the set of parameters @xmath28 , the features of the dynamics will change with variations of the parameters .",
    "generically , periodic orbits and their linear stability are robust to small changes of parameters , except at specific values where bifurcations occur .",
    "the proposed residue method to control chaos detects these rare events to yield the appropriate values of the parameters leading to the prescribed behavior on the dynamics .",
    "the residue method which leads to a reduction or an enhancement of the chaotic properties of the system is based on the change of stability of periodic orbits upon a change of the parameters of the system . for @xmath29 ,",
    "let us consider two associated birkhoff periodic orbits ( i.e.  periodic orbits having the same action but different angles in the integrable case and having the same rotation number on a selected poincar section ) , one elliptic @xmath30 and one hyperbolic @xmath31 .",
    "let us call @xmath32 and @xmath33 their residues .",
    "we have @xmath34 ( and smaller than one ) and @xmath35 .",
    "we slightly modify the parameters @xmath28 until the elliptic periodic orbits becomes parabolic .",

    "+ @xmath42  : @xmath43 while @xmath41 .",
    "+ the first case is associated with the creation of an invariant torus .",
    "the two latter cases might be associated with the destruction of invariant tori ( the ones around the elliptic periodic orbit ) .",
    "the third one is associated with a period doubling bifurcation . in this latter case , the change of stability of the new elliptic periodic orbit has to be considered .",
    "other interesting cases occur depending on the set of selected periodic orbits .",
    "the situation @xmath37 resembles the integrable situation where all the residues of periodic orbits of constant action are zero .",
    "it is expected that an invariant torus is reconstructed in this case .",
    "it can be associated with a transcritical bifurcation ( an exchange of stability ) , a fold , or another type of bifurcation .",
    "in the situation @xmath39 , a change of stability occurs  : the elliptic periodic orbit turns hyperbolic while the hyperbolic one stays hyperbolic .",
    "it is generically characterized by a stationary bifurcation . in this case , the destruction of invariant curves is expected in general whether there are librational ones ( representing the linear stability of an elliptic periodic orbit ) or the neighboring rotational ones .",
    "an extra caution has to be formulated since this method only provides an indicator of the _ linear _ stability of periodic orbits .",
    "the nonlinear stability ( or instability ) has to be checked a posteriori by a poincar section for instance .",
    "this method only states that a bifurcation has occurred in the system , whether it is a stationary , transcritical , period doubling or other types of bifurcations .",
    "a more rigorous and safer control method would require to consider the global bifurcations , like the ones obtained by the intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds of two hyperbolic periodic orbits in the spirit of ref .",
    "however such a control method would be computer - time consuming ( determination of the stable and unstable manifolds ) and hence not practical if some short time delay feedback is involved in the control process .",
    "we consider the following forced pendulum system with 1.5 degrees of freedom @xmath44 a poincar section of hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : fp ] ) is depicted on fig .",

    "the neighborhood of this periodic orbit becomes a chaotic layer and the qualitative change in the dynamics is seen since the chaotic layer becomes thicker at this value of the parameter .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) , the regularization is not drastic . in order to obtain a more significant change in the dynamics and a large chaotic zone , one needs to select a periodic orbit inside a regular region , like for instance the one with @xmath53 .",

    "it allows us to compare the results with the ones obtained by a control method proposed in refs .",
    "first , the idea is to look at the creation of a specific invariant torus .",
    "for instance , we select a torus which has been widely discussed in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , the goldenmean one , which has a frequency @xmath67 for hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : fp2 ] ) .",
    "we choose @xmath46 , and we first notice that when @xmath57 , this hamiltonian does not have such an invariant torus ( since its critical value is @xmath68  @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose here is to find the value of the control parameter @xmath47 needed by the residue method to reconstruct this invariant torus ( such that hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : fp2 ] ) has this invariant torus ) .",
    "the idea of doing this follows greene s residue criterion . by performing an appropriate change of stability on higher and higher order periodic orbits",
    ", the amplitude of the control term should be smaller and smaller . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the residues of the elliptic and hyperbolic periodic orbit vanish at @xmath70 , and for @xmath71 , at @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "both residues vanish at @xmath74 and also at @xmath75 . at these values of the parameter ,",
    "the phase space is locally filled by invariant tori where it is also expected that the goldenmean invariant torus is present .",
    "we notice that the elliptic periodic orbit with @xmath76 ( the next one in greene s residue approach for the analysis of the golden mean torus ) is destabilized at @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , there is no elliptic periodic orbit with @xmath76 at @xmath46 and the analysis using the coupled elliptic / hyperbolic periodic orbits can not be carried out .",
    "however , by following the two ( initially hyperbolic ) periodic orbits with @xmath76 , we see that both residues vanish at @xmath78 .",
    "we compared these values of stabilization with the one given by a method of local control based on an appropriate modification of the potential to reconstruct a specific invariant torus  @xcite .",
    "such method provides explicitly the shape ( and amplitude ) of possible control terms whereas the one used in this article has been guessed from these references . by appropriate truncation ( keeping the main fourier mode ) , this method provides @xmath79 where @xmath67 , as an approximate control term .",
    "therefore the amplitude is @xmath80 which is of the same order as the values obtained by zeroing the residues .",
    "however , we point out that smaller values are obtained by looking at higher periodic orbits .",
    "therefore , an efficient control strategy is to combine the advantages of both methods  : first , the specific shape of the terms that have to be added to regularize the system is obtained using the method of ref .",
    "then the amplitudes of these terms are lowered using high order periodic orbits . by considering the control term used in this article",
    ", we expect that zeroing the residues of high period will not be feasible with just this term ( as it is the case for instance in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . a more suitable form of control terms would be constructed from an exact control term which is @xmath81 however , it should be noticed that a control term given by ref .",
    "@xcite is not always experimentally accessible .",
    "the idea is to use a projection of this control term onto a basis of accessible functions .",
    "this projected control term would give an idea of the type of control terms to be used for the residue method .",
    "we would like to stress that in the absence of elliptic islands an initial guess for the newton - raphson method is not straightforward from the inspection of the poincar section .",
    "in particular , it is not easy to select the appropriate hyperbolic periodic orbits which will lead to a significant change in the dynamics .",
    "however , once it has been located , the method can follow them by continuity in the same way as the elliptic ones since the newton - raphson method does not depend on the linear stability of these orbits .",
    "this makes the method more difficult ( although possible ) to handle for just hyperbolic periodic orbits .      in this section , we consider hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : fp2 ] ) with @xmath82 .",
    "we notice that for @xmath57 , hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : fp2 ] ) does have the rotational goldenmean torus .",
    "the purpose is to find some small values of the parameter @xmath47 where this invariant torus is destroyed .",
    "we notice that this case is easier to find than in the previous section since it is well - known that any additional perturbation will end up by destroying an invariant torus generically . here",
    "it means that there will be large intervals of parameters for which the torus is broken ( contrary to the case of the creation of invariant tori ) .",
    "however we will add an additional assumption that the parameters for which this invariant torus is destroyed has to be small compared with the perturbation .",
    "we also notice that the destruction of the golden mean invariant torus is first obtained for negative values of the control parameter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "first we illustrate the method by considering specific elliptic and hyperbolic periodic orbits ( with winding ratio @xmath83 ) near the goldenmean torus which will show the changes of dynamics occurring as the parameter is varied .",
    "we notice that the behaviors described below are generic for all the neighboring periodic orbits .",
    "the residues of these periodic orbits as functions of the parameter @xmath47 are shown in fig .",
    "we notice that the elliptic periodic orbit changes its stability , i.e.  becomes hyperbolic , at @xmath84 ( where its residue becomes equal to 1 ) .",
    "a close inspection of the poincar section shows on fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] that it undergoes a period doubling bifurcation into an elliptic periodic orbit with 26 intersections on the poincar section ( and winding ratio @xmath85 ) which has a residue zero at the bifurcation . by following the residue of this elliptic periodic orbit ( depicted by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) we see that it vanishes for @xmath86 . at this value of the parameter and for higher value in amplitude , all the periodic orbits considered here ( the two with @xmath53 and the one with @xmath87 ) are hyperbolic .",
