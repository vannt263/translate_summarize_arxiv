    "the exclusive photoproduction of heavy vector mesons is a kind of diffractive process where , besides a soft scale characterized by the hadron size , there is clearly a hard scale ( mesons mass @xmath3 ) that allows to analyse the reaction from the perturbative qcd point of view .",
    "this advantage creates ways to investigate the pomeron exchange which could lead to a better understanding of this object in terms of qcd . other advantage in studying this process occurs in ultra - peripheral collisions @xcite , where the impact parameter is larger than the sum of the radius of the interacting hadrons . in this case , the exclusive photoproduction dominates the process through the emission of virtual photons which interact with the target featuring the photon - target cross section .",
    "the photon - target interaction amplitude , when considering the light - cone dipole formalism @xcite , can be written as a convolution between the photon - meson wave functions overlap and the elementary dipole - target cross section @xcite .",
    "the exclusive quarkonium photoproduction has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically in recent years .",
    "it allows to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics as the masses of these heavy mesons give a perturbative scale for the problem even in the photoproduction limit .",
    "an important feature of these exclusive processes at the high energy regime is the possibility to investigate the hard pqcd pomeron exchange . at present energy regime at lhc photons",
    "can be considered as color dipoles in the mixed light cone representation , where their transverse size can be considered frozen during the interaction @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scattering process is characterized by the color dipole cross section describing the interaction of those color dipoles with the nucleon or nucleus target .",
    "the referred approach is quite intuitive and brings information on the dynamics beyond the leading logarithmic qcd approach .",
    "the dynamics related to the meson formation is given by their wave - functions and to compute predictions for their excited states is a reasonably task @xcite .    in this work , we investigate the exclusive production of @xmath4 and its radially excited states @xmath5 and @xmath6 in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions in the lhc energy interval . in previous works",
    "@xcite some of us have considered coherent photoproduction of @xmath7 and @xmath8 states at various energies in @xmath9 and pbpb ( lead - lead ) collisions at the lhc .",
    "those calculations were carried out in the theoretical framework of the color light - cone dipole formalism @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the corresponding predictions describe nicely the experimental results from alice @xcite and lhcb @xcite collaborations on the charmonia production . in the dipole framework",
    ", the heavy quark - antiquark fluctuation of the incoming quasi - real photons interacts with the target via the dipole cross section , and the result is projected into the wave - function of the observed meson state .",
    "the photoproduction also gives us ways to investigate the transition between the linear dynamics , governed by dglap ( gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) and bfkl ( balitskii - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ) evolution equations , and the non - linear dynamics where the physical process of the partonic recombination , e.g. @xmath10 , becomes important .",
    "in the energies available at lhc , the transition of the regime described by the linear dynamics of emissions chain to a new regime , where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important , is expected .",
    "it is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wave - function , the so - called parton saturation phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the transition is set by the saturation scale @xmath11 , which is enhanced in the nuclear case .",
    "therefore , the color dipole approach will include both the parton saturation effects in photon - proton interaction as nuclear shadowing effects in photon - nucleus process . as examples of the values of bjorken @xmath12 reached at lhc ( at mid - rapidity )",
    "one has @xmath13 for @xmath9 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 collisions .",
    "those values are even smaller for very forward rapidities , e.g. for @xmath18 the @xmath12-value diminishes by a factor one hundred .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the main theoretical information to compute the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of @xmath19 states in @xmath9 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 collisions for present and future runs at the lhc .",
    "we directly compare the results to the experimental data measured by the lhcb collaboration @xcite for @xmath4 in @xmath9 collisions . in the section [ discussions ] we present the numerical calculations ,",
    "discuss the main theoretical uncertainties and a comparison with other approaches is done . in particular , we contrast the main results against the predictions available using the starlight monte carlo @xcite . in the last section",
    "we show the main conclusions .",
    "at high energies , the total cross section for photoproduction of a vector meson @xmath20 in ultra - peripheral @xmath9 , @xmath15 or @xmath17 collisions can be written in a factorized way as follows @xcite @xmath21 where the first term , @xmath22 , represents the virtual photons flux and can be calculated from the weizscker - williams method @xcite .",

    "( @xmath35 ) will be computed from the following scattering amplitude in the photoproduction limit ( @xmath36 ) @xcite , @xmath37 where the quantity @xmath38 represents the overlap of the photon - meson wave functions and @xmath39 is the dipole - target scattering amplitude ( assumed to be imaginary ) .",
    "accordingly , the usual kinematical variables are as follows : @xmath12 is the bjorken variable and the squared momentum transfer in hadron vertex is @xmath40 .",
    "the variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the quark and the transverse color dipole size , respectively .    from eq .",
    "( @xmath43 ) , we will consider the simplification that the @xmath44 dependence on the amplitude is exponential , @xmath45 .",

    "the integrated cross section ( in the range @xmath86 ) is predicted to be @xmath87 pb and @xmath88 pb , respectively .",
    "the error includes the theoretical uncertainty related to the model of the dipole cross section . when considering the higher energy of @xmath89 tev the values",

    "the model deviation is more intense on the very forward rapidity and the theoretical uncertainty reaches a factor two similarly to the @xmath9 case . the rapidity distribution exhibits directly the influence of the @xmath12-dependence of the dipole cross section in the interval @xmath95 , and specially for rapidities around @xmath96 .",
    "the shapes are similar for the lowest state and its radial excited states .",
    "therefore , it is feasible that a consideration of @xmath94 photoproduction in this rapidity interval offers potential in discriminating models of dipole cross sections .",
    "it is timely having a measurement of @xmath94 production at mid - rapidity , as the corresponding cross section in the @xmath97 case it is a challenge when considering the color dipole approaches .",

    "now , the mid - rapidity region seems to show sensitivity to discriminate models of dipole cross section and corresponding nuclear effects . compared to the starlight monte carlo @xcite , now our predictions are quite similar for the @xmath4 state ( we show the large theoretical uncertainty in modeling the dipole cross sections ) but lower values for the @xmath102 states . in general , the glauber model considered in @xcite involves less nuclear shadowing than the glauber - gribov approach we have used . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath94 production also was analyzed in @xmath17 collisions and we verify that the theoretical uncertainty in the color dipole approach is comparable to that present in perturbative two - gluon exchange formalism . in present study only the coherent channel is considered . an important investigation would be the inclusion of ultra - peripheral collisions accompanied by photonuclear breakup .",
    "the procedure for obtaining it involves the multiplication of original photon flux by a probability factor for the desired nuclear breakup .",
