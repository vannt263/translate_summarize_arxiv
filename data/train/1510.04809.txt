    "since the first redshift surveys in the late 1970s , the two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of galaxies has emerged as an important probe of the cosmological parameters ( e.g. peebles 1980 ; anderson et al .",
    "the 2pcf is often reported as a function solely of pair separation , @xmath0 , corresponding to having been isotropically averaged around the observer . however , in reality the measured clustering depends both on the separation and on the line of sight to each galaxy in the pair .",
    "this breaking of isotropy , known as redshift space distortion ( rsd ) , occurs because galaxies are not comoving with the background expansion of the universe , but rather have peculiar velocities generated both by virialization within clusters and by the growth of large - scale structure .",
    "consequently distance information along the line of sight , obtained by assuming all galaxies are comoving with the background expansion , is not fully accurate .",
    "the measured separation @xmath0 will therefore be faulty , more so the more the separation lies along the line of sight of either of the galaxies .",
    "while rsd present a challenge for comparison with theory , they also offer an opportunity . if general relativity ( gr ) is assumed , the anisotropic clustering probes the combination @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate and @xmath3 the clustering on @xmath4 scales ( percival & white 2009 ; samushia , percival & raccanelli 2012 ; chuang & wang 2013 ; oka et al .",
    "alternatively , the velocities inferred from anisotropic clustering can be compared with those predicted by gr as a stringent test of the latter ( taruya et al .",
    "2014 ; taddei & amendola 2015 ) .",
    "as already noted , the observed clustering depends on both the separation and the angle between the separation and the line of sight to each galaxy in the pair .",
    "the full geometry is therefore a triangle formed by the observer and the pair of galaxies .",
    "however in practice the geometry is often reduced from 3 parameters to 2 by defining an average line of sight .",
    "this does not lose much information if the typical triangle opening angle @xmath5 is small , as is commonly the case in present - day surveys .",
    "there are several approaches to defining an average line of sight .",
    "the crudest approach , known as flat - sky or plane - parallel , is using a single line of sight @xmath6 to the entire survey .",
    "this is appropriate if the angular scale of the survey is small .",
    "the kaiser formula ( 1987 ) in fourier space or the hamilton formulae in real space ( 1992 ) were derived under this assumption using linear perturbation theory ( pt ) ( see also taylor & hamilton 1996 ; nishioka & yamamoto 1999 ; bharadwaj 2001 ) .",
    "these formulae predict the multipole moments of the clustering with respect to the cosine @xmath7 of the angle between this single line of sight and the separation .",
    "the parity of the legendre polynomials demands that only even multipoles enter , and the expansion is relatively compact , involving only @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these formulae have been the dominant framework for interpreting anisotropic 2pcf or power spectrum measurements , often with some additional prescription for small - scale , non - linear effects such as fingers of god caused by collapse and virialization ( jackson 1972 ; peacock & dodds 1996 ; scoccimarro 2004 ; taruya , nishimichi & saito 2010 )",
    ".    however , many surveys are now too wide in angle to make the flat - sky approximation .",
    "a more accurate definition for the average line of sight is either the line of sight to a single pair member ( spm ) ( yamamoto et al .",
    "2006 ) , the angle bisector of the triangle opening angle ( szalay , matsubara & landy 1998 ; matsubara 2000 ; szapudi 2004 ; yoo & seljak 2015 ) , or the vector from the observer to the separation s midpoint ( yamamoto et al . 2006 ; samushia , branchini & percival 2015 ; bianchi et al . 2015 ) .",
    "these methods will be the primary focus of this work .",
    "they are all still approximate relative to tracking the full triangular geometry , but , as we will show , the information they lose is at @xmath10 in the opening angle rather than @xmath11 as in the flat - sky approach .",
    "indeed , it has been found empirically that for @xmath12 , there is very little difference between using the midpoint method and using the full triangular geometry ( samushia , percival & raccanelli 2012 ; beutler et al .",
    "2012 ; yoo & seljak 2015 ) .",
    "it is well known that fourier transforms ( fts ) can provide large speed advantages for the computation of correlation functions .",
    "it is therefore desirable to be able to apply fts to these more accurate methods for the line of sight .",
    "however , applying fts to compute these lines of sight is not transparent beause the line of sight varies throughout the survey volume .",
    "fts do have the disadvantage that they grid the data , losing some spatial information ( see slepian & eisenstein 2015 , hereafter se15 , for further discussion ) .",
    "however , in contexts where number of catalogs or objects is more important than spatial precision , ft techniques are an important complement to direct pair counting .",
    "it has recently been shown that the spm method for the anisotropic 2pcf can be evaluated using fts ( se15 ) , and bianchi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and scoccimarro ( 2015 ) show the same for the anisotropic power spectrum . in the present work ,",
    "we show how bisector and midpoint methods can also be evaluated with fts .",
    "we do so by using taylor series to compute the difference between these methods and the spm method , showing that at leading order the difference is @xmath10",
    ". the bisector and midpoint methods also differ from each other at this order .",
    "we present a slight generalization of the spm estimator that is still computable with fts and can be translated to the bisector and midpoint methods including terms of @xmath10 .",
    "the present work is complementary to recent work by samushia , branchini & percival ( 2015 ) empirically comparing the flat - sky and spm methods to the midpoint method . for flat - sky",
    "they find a scale - independent multiplicative renormalization of the @xmath13 moments of the anisotropic power spectrum , which should translate to the same effect in the anisotropic 2pcf .",
    "for spm they find a more complicated , scale - dependent difference from the midpoint method .",
    "they give correction formulae for both cases assuming a thin - shell spherical cap survey , that @xmath5 is small , and that boundary effects are negligible . providing these assumptions hold , samushia , branchini & percival s formulae can be used to translate spm to midpoint .",
    "one element of our work here is also such a conversion , but with no restrictions on survey geometry , triangle opening angle , or survey boundaries .",
    "we close by calculating pt predictions for this generalized estimator including @xmath10 wide - angle contributions from the full three - parameter geometry , from which the predictions for bisector and midpoint method can be straightforwardly found .",
    "these predictions improve upon the kaiser / hamilton formulae in two ways : they use more accurate lines of sight , and they include wide - angle , @xmath10 terms . while computed using a straightforward inverse ft of formulae in ppai & szapudi ( 2008 ) , our predictions may be of more practical utility because they are presented in a basis in which the data can be measured using fts .",
    "further , ppai & szapudi include a number of `` non - perturbative '' terms involving reciprocal trigonemetric functions of the triangle s angles ; our work perturbatively orders these corrections in powers of @xmath5 .    throughout this work ,",
    "we present explicit expressions including only the leading @xmath10 wide - angle corrections .",
    "however the techniques we develop , both for relating spm and bisector / midpoint methods and for computing the pt predictions , are fully general and could be used to arbitrary order in @xmath5 .    while wide - angle corrections are not important at the baryon acoustic oscillation scale of @xmath14 in current surveys such as boss , working on larger scales such as those relevant for measurements of primordial non - gaussianity ( dalal et al .",
    "2008 ) will likely require these corrections , especially given the small amplitude of the signal being sought .",
    "the spm estimator computes the value of the 2pcf weighted by legendre polynomials of the angle between the line of sight to one galaxy , given by the vector to that galaxy @xmath15 , and the separation vector @xmath16 .",
    "we have    @xmath17    @xmath18 bins separations into bins denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the sum above occurs because each pair of galaxies enters twice , once with sightline as @xmath20 and once with sightline as @xmath21 .",
    "thus the spm estimator averages over lines of sight after first weighting by the multipoles .",
    "as shown in se15 , decomposing the legendre polynomial @xmath22 into spherical harmonics using the spherical harmonic addition theorem allows evaluation of this estimator with fts ; bianchi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and scoccimarro ( 2015 ) show the analogous result for the anisotropic power spectrum .",
    "the bisector estimator computes the 2pcf weighted by legendre polynomials in the cosine @xmath23 of the angle between the angle bisector of @xmath5 and the separation vector @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath5 is the opening angle of the observer - galaxy - pair triangle ; the geometry is shown in the lefthand panel of figure [ fig : midpt_bisec_fig ] .",

    "\\label{eqn : bisec_def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the spm estimator averages over lines of sight after projecting onto @xmath26 , the bisector method does so before projecting .",
    "the difference between the two methods is simply produced by the extent to which these two operations fail to commute .",
    "the midpoint estimator computes the 2pcf weighted by legendre polynomials in the cosine @xmath27 of the angle between the vector pointing from the observer to separation s midpoint and the separation .",
    "this geometry is shown in the righthand panel of figure [ fig : midpt_bisec_fig ] .",
    "we have @xmath28 where the bisector method took unit vectors to each galaxy and then averaged them , this method averages first and then takes the unit vector .",
    "the difference between bisector and midpoint is thus again produced by a commutation failure .",
    "here we show that the three methods of  [ sec : definitions ] only disagree at @xmath10 and compute this difference explicitly .",
    "figure 1 shows our notation : @xmath29 is the segment of @xmath0 cut by the vector @xmath30 ; the bisector cuts @xmath0 into two possibly unequal segments @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for the midpoint , @xmath33 for small @xmath5 ; indeed in this limit @xmath34 .",

    "these predictions can be easily translated to predictions for the bisector and midpoint methods using our earlier work ; this shows the error induced if wide - angle corrections are neglected .",
    "a number of previous works have predicted the wide - angle corrections to the anisotropic power spectrum or 2pcf ( fisher , scharf & lahav 1994 ; zaroubi & hoffman 1994 ; heavens & taylor 1994 ; tegmark & bromley 1995 ; hamilton & culhane 1996 ; szalay 1998 ; bharadwaj 1999 ; taylor & valentine 1999 ; matsubara 2000 ; szapudi 2004 ; ppai & szapudi 2008 ; reimberg , bernardeau & pitrou 2015 ) ; indeed ppai & szapudi ( 2008 ) was our starting point here .",
    "the key advance of our work is casting this prediction in terms of an estimator that can be easily measured using fts , as well as ordering our prediction in a perturbative series in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "this ordering shows the error induced when rsd are measured using only 2 parameters ( separation and angle between the separation and the line of sight ) rather than 3 ( separation and two lines of sight or an equivalent combination ) .",
    "thus if the maximum opening angle of the triangles in a given survey were known , an upper bound could be simply placed on the error induced by ignoring wide - angle corrections .",

    "will then be straightforward to extract from data a measurement of @xmath1 that is more accurate than those obtained using the kaiser / hamilton formulae .    given the large number of objects and large volumes of upcoming surveys such as desi and euclid , it will be desirable to have ft methods for computing the anisotropic 2pcf that permit use of any desired definition of the line of sight . since gridding the data does lose some spatial information",
    ", we expect that fourier techniques will complement rather than replace pair counting in this context , being especially useful where the trade - off between spatial accuracy and a large number of objects or catalogs is favorable",
    ". the speed of the approach presented here should be particularly helpful in using thousands of mock catalogs to compute covariance matrices , in doing edge correction which requires computing the anisotropic 2pcf for of order @xmath150 random catalogues per dataset , and in testing pt predictions against n - body simulations .",
