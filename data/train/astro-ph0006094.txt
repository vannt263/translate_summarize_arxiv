    "arcs and multiple sources are indicative of lensing .",
    "however , the color differences between the three sources and the arc are significant , suggesting that they are not likely to be lensed images of one and the same source .",
    "the foreground cluster a2125 may magnify both mm source intensities by gravitational lensing , but since both sources are relatively far from the cluster center , the effect should be small .",

    "this indicates that the object may not be at very high redshift , i.e. , at @xmath78 , which is consistent with the photometric redshift of @xmath79 derived from the observed optical / near - ir colors .",
    "carilli and yun ( @xcite , @xcite ; cy ) have shown that the radio  to  sub - mm spectral index provides a rough indication of redshift for star forming galaxies , based on the tight radio  to  far infrared correlation for star forming galaxies found by condon ( @xcite ; see also dunne et al .",
    "@xcite ; dce ) .",
    "this correlation however assumes a narrow range of dust temperatures , because a high-@xmath12 object with warm dust would show the same spectral index as one with cool dust at low @xmath12 ( blain @xcite ) .",
    "redshift estimates based on the radio  to  sub - mm spectral index are thus to be taken with caution .",
    "cfrs14a has a radio flux density at 5ghz of 44@xmath0jy . assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath80 , typical for star forming galaxies ( condon @xcite ) , implies an expected 1.4 ghz flux density of 120@xmath0jy .",

    "it is also important to keep in mind that these models are relying on the idea that the radio  to  sub - mm correlation for star forming galaxies is independent of redshift .",
