    "variational principles occupy a privileged place in the history of physics .",
    "they provide approximate results to formidable problems where it is difficult to find analytical solutions from other methods @xcite .",
    "the first variational principle was established in mechanics by maupertuis ( 1744 ) .",
    "its interest and importance was later realized by lagrange , who referred to it as _ the most beautiful and important discovery of mechanics _",
    "this principle led to an elegant geometrization of mechanics @xcite for conservative systems , and had enormous consequences in the subsequent development of physics .",
    "the variational principles of mechanics constituted the key idea of the former mechanical approaches to thermodynamics .",
    "these were first attempted independently by boltzmann and clausius and later continued by helmholtz @xcite .",
    "these pioneering works allowed for a certain understanding of thermodynamics from mechanics @xcite but their importance was later underestimated in favour of a statistical interpretation of thermodynamics .",
    "the history of these developments and the confusion surrounding boltzmann ideas have been recently illuminated by some authors @xcite .    despite one century of successful results coming from the statistical approach ,",
    "the bridge between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic behaviour is still an open issue .",
    "probabilistic concepts are not only extremely useful in practical situations but play also a central role in laying the microscopic foundations of thermodynamics . the following criticism by einstein to boltzmann ( who realized the importance of the statistical approach in later works ) @xcite still holds : _ the systems considered in statistical mechanics are dynamical systems , consisting of moving particles [ and therefore ] the statistical results should all be derivable from the dynamics_.    in this article , we present some novel thermodynamic ideas which are grounded in the maupertuis principle as well as in the modern general theory of dynamical systems .",
    "ergodicity and probability assumptions ( phase space averaging ) are not invoked , and only time averages coming from the microscopic mechanics are considered .",
    "our approach makes use of hamiltonians given in terms of action - angle variables @xmath0 where @xmath1 are vectors containing suitable action and angle variables respectively , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , the  integrable  and  nonintegrable  parts of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is generally possible to construct such hamiltonians from , for example , mechanical variational principles @xcite .",
    "then , we show that thermal states can be fully characterized by the action variables .",
    "when the system is nonintegrable , these variables do not need to be adiabatic invariants but the entropy , defined as a function of them , must not change significantly within a period of the oscillation of any degree of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the dynamical concepts of equilibrium temperature , entropy and heat differential .",
    "the central concept in our approach is the nonequilibrium entropy for a system of many dofs , which is introduced in section iii .",
    "we then link this result to the ones in section ii and a natural , dynamical definition of probability arises , yielding an einstein relationship at the thermodynamic limit . in section",
    "iv we show that entropy attains its maximum at equilibrium for macroscopic systems with short - range interactions .",
    "this connects results in sections ii and iii . in section",
    "v we apply this dynamically based thermodynamic formalism to several systems of different nature : ideal systems ( noninteracting oscillators , ideal gas ) and systems with short and long - range interactions .",
    "we show how our dynamical definitions correctly reproduce previous equilibrium results obtained from the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "finally , in section vi , we provide an application to nonequilibrium stationary states in a network of coupled oscillators ( kuramoto model ) .",
    "we study the entropy production in this system by means of the nonequilibrium theory developed in sections iii and iv and illustrate its physical significance .",
    "we find that the entropy production at the stationary state is directly related to dissipation in attaining order far from equilibrium through synchronization .",
    "numerical calculations are performed to clarify this result .",
    "in the prehistory of statistical mechanics ( i.e. before the introduction of any probabilistic concept ) boltzmann provided a mechanical foundation of thermodynamics for monocyclic systems with only one dof @xcite .",
    "the constant energy trajectories in phase space of these systems ( e.g. a single harmonic oscillator ) were bounded , periodic orbits , and boltzmann defined heat as the energy difference between two orbits .",
    "then he introduced a dynamical temperature and proved that its reciprocal is an integrating factor for the heat differential , which allowed him to identify the entropy of the system . in this article",
    "we follow a different path inspired in the maupertuis principle .",
    "our approach is valid for @xmath4 dofs and reduces to boltzmann s theory for @xmath5 .",
    "consider a system whose hamiltonian @xmath6 depends on time @xmath7 and generalized position coordinates @xmath8 and momenta @xmath9 , where @xmath4 is the number of dofs .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation reads then @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lagrangian action and @xmath12 is the lagrangian of the system . for conservative systems , @xmath13",
    ", action can be varied with respect to the time @xmath14 of the trajectory and the following equation is satisfied @xcite @xmath15 since time can be separated in the hamilton - jacobi equation , after integration we obtain @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the abbreviated action .",
    "the maupertuis principle of classical mechanics states that _ the abbreviated action @xmath18 of the trajectory of the motion is an extremum over all possible energy - conserving trajectories that pass through ending points @xmath19 and @xmath20 in an arbitrary time @xmath14 _ @xcite .    from the total variation of the action @xmath21 , and eq .",
    "( [ variationtime ] ) , we have @xmath22 in the case of closed orbits this equation is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the abbreviated action of a closed orbit and @xmath25 is the ( poincar ) time needed for its completion .",
    "it is then clear that the product of @xmath26 and the recurrence frequency @xmath27 has dimensions of energy .",
    "we define the _ dynamical _ equilibrium temperature as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "a similar definition was introduced by boltzmann for the case @xmath4 = 1 ( see @xcite , p. 419 ) . since @xmath26 is an invariant of the motion and",
    "does not depend on the choice of coordinates @xcite , the equilibrium temperature does not depend on this choice either .",
    "the dynamical definition of the equilibrium entropy @xmath30 is introduced so that the thermodynamic equation @xmath31 is satisfied . since eqs.([time closed orbit ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) lead to @xmath32 the equilibrium entropy @xmath30 is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an integration constant with dimensions of inverse action ( in the following we take @xmath34 as unity ) .",
    "consistently , the heat differential is defined as @xmath35 which represents _ the variation of energy involved in changing the action on the closed trajectory_. thus , it is satisfied that @xmath36 is an integrating factor for the heat differential , @xmath37",
    ".    these thermodynamic expressions are useful if we are able to calculate @xmath26 from the microscopic dynamics . for systems with @xmath5 and bounded orbits this is always possible since the hamiltonian is integrable .",
    "the constant energy @xmath38 can then be directly related to @xmath26 . for systems with many dofs",
    ", ergodic theory has provided the means for calculating @xmath26 .",
    "this theory establishes the equality between time averages and phase space averages under certain conditions and the birkhoff theorem .",
    "our approach does not require ergodicity but leads to the same results if birkhoff theorem holds , as shown in appendix a.",
    "to extend the formalism to nonequilibrium systems with many dofs , we write the hamiltonian as in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) by means of an appropriate canonical transformation .",
    "this yields a set of action - angle variables @xmath39 whose evolution is then considered .",
    "the term @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) does not come from a perturbation expansion and it is not necessarily smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is associated to energy exchange between dofs in the form of heat . in that case",
    "the @xmath40 s are neither adiabatic invariants nor constants of the motion but suitable generalized coordinates with dimensions of action .",
    "these action - angle variables are to be understood as effective ones , coming from approximations consistent with the dynamics of the hamiltonian under consideration ( a criterion to be satisfied for appropriate action variables is given below ) . since each dof oscillates periodically with its effective frequency , it is physically meaningful to consider the action @xmath40 of the dof @xmath41 on its closed cycle with the understanding that this cycle can be completed by the dof going back and forth following the hill s region ( i.e. the region in configuration space to which the dof is confined ) until it reaches its initial angle . only in the limit of vanishing @xmath3",
    "are the action variables adiabatic invariants also : they correspond to the integrable part of the hamiltonian and solve _ exactly _ the integrable dynamics .",
    "this kind of representations is used in plasma physics and can be constructed for general hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "we define the `` temperature '' and `` entropy '' of the dof @xmath41 as @xmath42 @xmath43 so that the thermodynamic formalism for one dof resembles that for the whole system . the energy of each dof @xmath44 ( @xmath41 = 1 , ... , @xmath4 ) can vary subject to the constraint that the total energy @xmath45 is constant , and it is satisfied that @xmath46 .",
    "these definitions are reasonable because eqs .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) apply to _ any _ mechanical system , regardless of its size , and each dof in the hamiltonian behaves as a  system  with energy @xmath44 .",
    "however , contrarily to the many - dof system for which the total energy @xmath38 is a constant , each dof usually exchanges energy with the others ( provided that @xmath3 in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) is nonvanishing and the dofs are separated in @xmath2 ) .",
    "the energy @xmath44 is to be understood as a _ time average _ on the hill s region in which the dof moves .",
    "this is clear from the hamilton - jacobi equation , which can be applied both to the composite system and to each dof separately with the understanding that , in the latter case , each dof behaves as a system exchanging energy with the others and its energy is , therefore , a time average .",
    "the entropy of one dof , eq .",
    "( [ entropy dof i ] ) can of course change with time but to be physically meaningful it must not change significantly during one period @xmath47 of the oscilation of the dof i. the dof @xmath41 has explored its whole available hill region only after completing a period .",
    "the entropy of one dof is defined in terms of the _ whole _",
    "available hill region at a given time @xmath7 and it would be inconsistent not to have an almost constant value of this quantity within one period of the oscillation .",
    "this leads to stablish a criterion on the suitability of the action variables which , as pointed out above , need not to be adiabatic invariants .",
    "the condition to be satisfied comes from expanding the entropy of a dof @xmath48 in a time @xmath49 respect to its value at time @xmath7 . keeping only linear terms in @xmath50 we have @xmath51 the action variables are appropriate when the absolute value of the second term in the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ crit1 ] ) is much lower than unity .",
    "this implies @xmath52 if the action variables @xmath40 are adiabatic invariants this criterion is automatically ( and in the best way ) satisfied .",
    "but this is only a sufficient condition and not a necessary one .",
    "given any hamiltonian in action - angle variables , the criterion in eq .",
    "( [ crit2 ] ) can be applied to decide if the action variables are appropriate or if a canonical transformation to find a better set of variables is needed .",
    "if this condition is met , the temperature of one dof is also well defined from eq .",
    "( [ temperature dof i ] ) @xmath53    it is to be noted that action variables bear geometric properties of the phase space in the large @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in the fact that in obtaining the action variable @xmath54 the momentum of the @xmath41-th dof @xmath55 is integrated on a closed domain in configuration space involving the coordinate position @xmath56 .",
    "this closed domain ( a monocycle ) in @xmath56 is the definition of hill s region of dof @xmath41 .",
    "the hill s region can be a macroscopic object and , therefore , action variables connect in this way the micro- and macroscales : the former one is suggested by the fact that we address each dof separately ; the latter comes in the distance over which the dof moves , an information contained in its action variable . in a complicated problem , any assumption made in approximating action variables is connected to an assumption on how the trajectory fills the available phase space .",
    "this is of special relevance for the second law ( discussed in the next section ) to hold since a nonvanishing @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is then required .",
    "this in turn implies that the action - angle variables considered are already effective i.e. approximate ones ( the exact action - angle variables would make the hamiltonian independent of angle variables , the system being integrable ) .",
    "a nonvanishing @xmath3 in the action - angle representation is necessary to get relaxation to equilibrium coming from the thermalization of the dofs .",
    "this term exist because of , for example , having interactions between many dofs that make the system nonintegrable .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure as employed in the foundations of standard statistical mechanics can be also thought as contained in a particular assumption made on the action variables : the one sketched in appendix a in which every possible point in phase space is equally visited and distributed over the hill s regions of all dofs . under such an approximation the dynamical trajectory is _ a one - cycle permutation of all attainable points ( or microstates ) in phase space_. this allows to speak about a phase space volume instead of a dynamical trajectory and to introduce well - behaved probability distributions related to densities of occupancy of the phase space . in @xcite this and other assumptions leading to different statistical mechanics formalisms are discussed from a different ( but closely related ) viewpoint .",
    "common to both lines of reasoning in @xcite and here is that for the possibility of providing sound equilibrium statistical arguments motivated by the dynamics , the system trajectory should be long enough in order to approximate the volume of phase space in which it is contained .",
    "a situation of upmost interest occurs when the total energy is equally shared by all dofs of the system , so that @xmath57 for every dof . in this case",
    ", the temperature of every dof is equal to the equilibrium temperature of the system defined by eq.([temperature ] ) , @xmath58 .",
    "this equilibrium state of the system is characterized by the conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 finite . in relation to the latter condition , it must be noticed that @xmath60 can be vanishingly small for macroscopic systems but then @xmath26 is large .",
    "thus , in an equilibrium state it is satisfied that @xmath61 and therefore @xmath62 this provides the energetic equation of the system .    in a nonequilibrium state , however , the temperatures and energies of each dof are different .",
    "the nonequilibrium entropy of the system in such cases is @xmath63 it depends on each @xmath44 through the action variables .",
    "this entropy corresponds to an open segment on the closed trajectory with abbreviated action @xmath64 , and the last equality in eq .",
    "( [ superentropy ] ) makes this explicit .",
    "it is worth noting that eqs.([entropy dof i ] ) and ( [ superentropy ] ) coincide with eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) when the system has only one dof .",
    "the same applies to temperatures defined by eqs .",
    "( [ temperature ] ) and ( [ temperature dof i ] ) .    for a closed trajectory",
    "it is satisfied that @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the kinetic energy .",
    "( it may be remembered that the condition @xmath67 leads to the equation of the geodesics of the jacobi metric @xmath68 @xcite . )",
    "a segment of the closed trajectory is said to be typical if @xmath69 where @xmath14 is the duration of the segment ( in all what follows @xmath14 must be understood as a much longer time than the period @xmath50 of the slowest dof @xmath41 ) .",
    "therefore , the nonequilibrium entropy for a typical segment is equal to the equilibrium entropy , and this opens the possibility of defining the equilibrium thermodynamic variables in terms of the action over a typical segment rather than in terms of the action over the whole closed ( macro)trajectory , as done in the previous section .",
    "that is , we can consider that at equilibrium the system moves along typical segments .",
    "these considerations are further explored in appendix b. in relation to this , it is remarkable that the existence of an equilibrium state implies , from eqs .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) and ( [ superentropy ] ) @xmath70=[j_{c}(e)]^{f } \\label{limiting}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the relaxation time .",
    "that is , if the system has a state of thermodynamic equilibrium _",
    "it attains this state after a time @xmath71 lower than @xmath25_. this suggests that _ the lower is @xmath71 ( compared to @xmath25 ) the more accurate is the description of the equilibrium state in terms of typical segments_. this is because departures from equilibrium are then short and , therefore , the closed trajectory contains a higher number of typical segments .",
    "since we can use eq.([superentropy ] ) also to deal with equilibrium situations provided we address typical segments , action variables illuminate first - order equilibrium phase transitions involving a discontinuous change in the entropy .",
    "if we think on a lennard - jones fluid , for example , the hill s region of a dof of a bound particle changes discontinuously when changing ( continuously ) the total energy of the particle from @xmath72 to @xmath73 . in the former situation , the hill s region is bounded by the attractive region of the potential . in the latter one , the hill s region",
    "is bounded by the macroscopic volume where the fluid is contained .",
    "this signals the transition from a liquid to a gas state , involving a discontinuity on the value of the action variables of many dofs ( since their energy is varied continuosly but their hill s regions change abruptly ) and , therefore , a discontinuity on the entropy , eq .",
    "( [ superentropy ] ) .",
    "the probability @xmath74 that the system can be found in a given segment @xmath75 [ i.e. a piece of micro - trajectory on the closed ( macro)trajectory ] is given by the ratio between its duration @xmath14 and the total duration of the closed trajectory @xmath25 @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the nonequilibrium entropy in the segment .",
    "if we ask for the probability of measuring certain macrovariables ( as @xmath78 ) during a finite measurement time , it is clear from the above that this is given by @xmath79 where the @xmath80 s are all segments on the closed trajectory consistent with the macrostate characterized by the macrovariables whose probability we ask .",
    "two consecutive typical segments of durations @xmath81 and @xmath82 produce a typical segment of duration @xmath83 . however , the contrary is not necessarily true : not all pieces on an arbitrary decomposition of a typical segment are also , in general , typical ones .",
    "eq.([superentropy ] ) suggests a roughly linear dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath4 and , in the thermodynamic limit , eq .",
    "( [ probability ] ) can be simplified to @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant .",
    "this equation states that segments with the highest entropy are also the most probable ones .",
    "these segments are also the typical ones since , on them , the average in eq . ( [ tempopen ] ) coincide with the average over the whole trajectory .",
    "this is a result of the mean value theorem for integrals .",
    "note , finally , the similarity of eq .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) and einstein s inversion formula @xcite .",
    "the latter equation is the basis for gibbs variational principle ( maximum entropy approach ) that allows to develop equilibrium statistical thermodynamics .",
    "in most macroscopic systems with short - range interactions the relation between the energy and the action for every dof is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a positive exponent ( and @xmath88 does not depend on energy ) and the entropy is then @xmath89 at equilibrium , @xmath90 , @xmath91 from eq .",
    "( [ energyeqi ] ) , and @xmath92 we can use the following mathematical inequality @xcite ( the geometric mean of a series of values @xmath44 is lower than its arithmetic mean ) @xmath93 then , since @xmath87 is positive , by comparing eqs.([superentropy2 ] ) and ( [ superentropyeq ] ) we obtain that @xmath94 where the equality only holds at equilibrium .",
    "therefore , in the evolution to equilibrium @xmath95 .",
    "this constitutes the mathematical statement of the second law for conservative macroscopic systems with short - range interactions .",
    "thermalization results from the coupling between dofs and leads to the homogeneity required for all thermal properties at equilibrium .",
    "obviously , no such coupling is possible in a conservative system with @xmath5 , and this is always  at equilibrium \" . during the relaxation to equilibrium ,",
    "each @xmath40 , @xmath44 , @xmath48 and @xmath77 can change with time . whether a system has a state of thermodynamic equilibrium or not is determined by the form of the nonintegrable part @xmath96 of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "if it vanishes and the dofs are separated in @xmath2 , the system does not have a thermodynamic equilibrium state .",
    "the dynamical equations are then integrable with @xmath4 integral invariants @xmath40 and the dofs are not able to exchange energy because of the existence of regular orbits . in such case",
    "the closed trajectory is then only composed of nontypical segments .",
    "nonintegrability of the hamiltonian is thus necessary to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "as the system approaches equilibrium the segments gradually become typical ones .",

    "[ fig5 ] that , from a mixed state ( a ) , separating pink particles from black particles ( b ) and then mixing them again ( c ) leads to a longer trajectory than passing through intermediate mixed states such as ( b ) . attaining ( b ) from ( a ) requires each particle to travel a certain distance so that it is then located in the appropriate macroscopic subvolume .",
