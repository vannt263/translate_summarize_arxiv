    "since adler s seminal paper @xcite , several groups have reported the formation and the propagation of concentration waves in bacteria suspensions @xcite . typically , a suspension of swimming bacteria such as _ e. coli _ self - concentrates in regions where the environment is slightly different such as the entry ports of the chamber ( more exposed to oxygen ) or regions of different temperatures .",
    "after their formation , these high concentration regions propagate along the channel , within the suspension .",
    "it is commonly admitted that chemotaxis ( motion of cells directed by a chemical signal ) is one of the key ingredients triggering the formation of these pulses .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a complete review of experimental assays and mathematical approaches to model these issues and to @xcite for all biological aspects of _ e. coli_.    our goal is to derive a macroscopic model for chemotactic pulses based on a mesoscopic underlying description ( made of kinetic theory adapted to the specific run - and - tumble process that bacteria undergo @xcite ) .",
    "we base our approach on recent experimental evidence for traveling pulses ( see fig . [",
    "fig : wavechannel ] ) .",
    "these traveling pulses possess the following features which we are able to recover numerically : constant speed , constant amount of cells , short timescale ( cell division being negligible ) , and strong asymmetry in the profile .",
    "we describe as usual the population of bacteria by its density @xmath0 ( at time @xmath1 and position @xmath2 ) .",
    "we restrict our attention to the one - dimensional case due to the specific geometry of the channels .",
    "the cell density follows a drift - diffusion equation , combining brownian diffusion together with directed fluxes being the chemotactic contributions .",
    "this is coupled to reaction - diffusion equations driving the external chemical concentrations . in this paper",
    "we consider the influence of two chemical species , namely the chemoattractant signal @xmath3 , and the nutrient @xmath4 .",
    "although this is a very general framework , it has been shown in close but different conditions that glycine can play the role of the chemoattractant @xcite .",
    "similarly , glucose is presumed to be the nutrient .",
    "the exact nature of the chemical species has very little influence on our modeling process .",
    "in fact there is no need to know precisely the mechanisms of signal integration at this stage .",
    "the model reads as follows : @xmath5    the chemoattractant is assumed to be secreted by the bacteria ( at a constant rate @xmath6 ) , and is naturally degraded at rate @xmath7 , whereas the nutrient is consumed at rate @xmath8 .",
    "both chemical species diffuse with possibly different molecular diffusion coefficients .",
    "we assume a linear integration of the signal at the microscopic scale , resulting in a summation of two independent contributions for the directed part of the motion expressed by the fluxes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we expect that the flux @xmath9 will contribute to gather the cell density and create a pulse .",
    "the flux @xmath10 will be responsible for the motion of this pulse towards higher nutrient levels .",
    "several systems of this type have been proposed and the upmost classical is the so - called keller - segel equation @xcite for which fluxes are proportional to the gradient of the chemical : @xmath11 in the absence of nutrient , such systems enhance a positive feedback which counteracts dispersion of individuals and may eventually lead to aggregation .",
    "there is a large amount of literature dealing with this subtle mathematical phenomenon ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "self - induced chemotaxis following the keller - segel model has been shown successful for modeling self - organization of various cell populations undergoing aggregation ( slime mold amoebae , bacterial colony ,  ) . in the absence of a chemoattractant @xmath12",
    "being produced internally , this model can be used to describe traveling pulses .",
    "however it is required that the chemosensitivity function @xmath13 is singular at @xmath14 @xcite . following the work of nagai and ikeda @xcite , horstmann and stevens",
    "have constructed a class of such chemotaxis problems which admit traveling pulses solutions @xcite , assuming the consumption of the ( nutrient ) signal together with a singular chemosensitivity .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for a presentation of various contributions to this problem , and to @xcite for recent developments concerning the stability of traveling waves in some parabolic - hyperbolic chemotaxis system .",
    "in addition , the contribution of cell division to the dynamics of keller - segel systems ( and specially traveling waves ) has been considered by many authors ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "however these constraints ( including singular chemosensitivity or growth terms ) seem unreasonable in view of the experimental setting we aim at describing .",
    "an extension of the keller - segel model was also proposed in seminal paper by brenner _",
    "@xcite for the self - organization of _",
    "e. coli_. production of the chemoattractant by the bacteria triggers consumption of an external field ( namely the succinate ) .",
    "their objective is to accurately describe aggregation of bacteria along rings or spots , as observed in earlier experiments by budrene and berg @xcite that were performed over the surface of gels .",
    "one phase of the analysis consists in resolving a traveling ansatz for the motion of those bacterial rings .",
    "however the simple scenario they first adopt can not resolve the propagation of traveling pulses .",
    "the authors give subsequently two possible directions of modeling : either observed traveling rings are transient , or they result from a switch in metabolism far behind the front .",
    "the experimental setting we are based on is quite different from budrene and berg s experiments ( in particular regarding the dynamics ) : for the experiments discussed in the present paper , the bacteria swim in a liquid medium and not on agar plates",
    ". therefore we will not follow @xcite .",
    "on the other hand salman et al .",
    "@xcite consider a very similar experimental setting .",
    "however the model they introduce to account for their observations is not expected to exhibit pulse waves ( although the mathematical analysis would be more complex in its entire form than in @xcite ) .",
    "actually fig .",
    "5 in @xcite is not compatible with a traveling pulse ansatz ( because the pulse amplitude is increasing for the time of numerical experiments ) .",
    "traveling bands have also been reported in other cell species , and especially the slime mold _ dictyostelium discoideum _ @xcite .",
    "notice that the original model by keller and segel @xcite was indeed motivated by the observation of traveling pulses in _ dictyostelium _ population under starvation .",
    "this question has been developped more recently by hfer et al .",
    "@xcite using the keller - segel model , as well as dolak and schmeiser @xcite and erban and othmer @xcite using kinetic equations for chemotaxis .",
    "according to these models , the propagating pulse waves of chemoattractant ( namely camp ) are sustained by an excitable medium .",
    "the cells respond chemotactically to these waves by moving up to the gradient of camp .",
    "great efforts have been successfully performed to resolve the `` back - of - the - wave paradox '' : the polarized cells are supposed not to turn back when the front passed away ( this would result in a net motion outwards the pulsatile centers of camp ) .",
    "although we are also focusing on the description of pulse waves , the medium is not expected to be excitable and the bacteria are not polarized .",
    "nevertheless , we will retain from these approaches the kinetic description originally due to alt and coauthors @xcite .",
    "this mathematical framework is well - suited for describing bacterial motion following a microscopic run - and - tumble process .",
    "a new class of models for the collective motion of bacteria has emerged recently .",
    "it differs significantly from the classical keller - segel model . rather than following intuitive rules ( or first order approximations )",
    ", the chemotactic fluxes are derived analytically from a mesoscopic description of the run - and - tumble dynamics at the individual level and possibly internal molecular pathways , see @xcite . the scaling limit which links the macroscopic flux @xmath9 ( or similarly @xmath10 ) to the kinetic description",
    "is now well understood since the pioneering works @xcite .",
    "here we propose to follow the analysis in @xcite , which is based on the temporal response of bacteria @xcite , denoted by @xmath15 in appendix .",
    "namely we write these fluxes as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a ( small ) parameter issued from the microscopic description of motion . namely @xmath17 is the ratio between the pulse speed and the speed of individual cells ( they differ by one order of magnitude at least according to experimental measurements ) .",
    "the function @xmath18 contains the microscopic features that stem from the precise response of a bacterium to a change in the environment ( see the appendix ) .",
    "it mainly results from the so - called response function at the kinetic level that describe how a single bacterium responds to a change in the concentration of the chemoattractant @xmath12 in its surrounding environment .",
    "we give below analytical and numerical evidence that traveling pulses exist following such a modeling framework .",
    "we also investigate the characteristic features of those traveling pulses at the light of experimental observations .",
    "the experiments presented in the present paper will be described in more details in a subsequent paper .",
    "briefly , in a setup placed under a low magnification fluorescence microscope maintained at @xmath19 , we fill polymer microchannels  section : ca .",
    "@xmath20 , length ca . @xmath21",
    " with a suspension of fluorescent _",
    "e. coli _ bacteria ",
    "strain rp437 considered wild - type for motility and chemotaxis , transformed with a pze1r - gfp plasmid allowing quantitative measurement of bacteria concentration inside the channel .",
    "we concentrate the cells at the extremity of the channel and monitor the progression of the subsequent concentration wave along the channel . in particular , we dynamically extract the shape of the front and its velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wavechannel ] ) .    coupling the model with the formula results in a parabolic type partial differential equation for the bacterial density @xmath22 , such as in the keller - segel system .",
    "it significantly differs from it however , as it derives in our case from a kinetic description of motion .",
    "especially the flux @xmath9 is uniformly bounded , whereas the chemotactic flux in keller - segel model generally becomes unbounded when aggregative instability occurs , which is a strong obstacle to the existence of traveling pulses .",
    "it is usually impossible to compute explicitely traveling pulse solutions for general systems such as . to obtain qualitative properties is also a difficult problem : we refer to @xcite for examples of rigorous results . here , we are able to handle analytical computations in the limiting case of a stiff signal response function , when the fluxes are given by the expression ( see the appendix ):",
    "@xmath23 @xmath24 in other words , a specific expression for @xmath18 in is considered in this section .",
    "it eventually reduces to @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "we seek traveling pulses , in other words particular solutions of the form @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the speed of the wave .",
    "this reduces ( [ eq : full model ] ) to a new system with a single variable @xmath31 : @xmath32 we prescribe the following conditions at infinity : @xmath33    we impose @xmath34 without loss of generality .",
    "this means that the fresh nutrient is located on the right side , and thus we look for an increasing nutrient concentration @xmath35 .",
    "we expect that the chemoattractant profile exhibits a maximum coinciding with the cell density peak ( say at @xmath36 ) , and we look for a solution where @xmath37 changes sign only once at @xmath36 .",
    "then , the fluxes - express under the traveling wave ansatz as : @xmath38    integrating once the cell density equation we obtain , @xmath39 the flux @xmath9 takes two values ( with a jump at @xmath40 ) , whereas the flux @xmath10 is constant .",
    "therefore the cell density is a combination of two exponential distributions : @xmath41 this combination of two exponentials perfectly match with the numerical simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : front propagation ] ) .     +      to close the analysis it remains to derive the two unknowns : the maximum cell density @xmath42 and the speed @xmath30 , given the mass and the constraint that @xmath43 vanishes at @xmath36 ( because @xmath44 reaches a maximum ) .    on the one hand , the total mass of bacteria is given by @xmath45 .",
    "on the other hand the chemotactic field is given by @xmath46 , where the fudamental solution of the equation for @xmath44 is @xmath47 to match the transition in monotonicity condition , the chemical signal should satisfy @xmath48 , that is @xmath49 , which leads to @xmath50 this leads to the following equation that we shall invert to obtain the front speed : @xmath51 from this relation we infer : @xmath52 we deduce from monotonicity arguments that there is a unique possible traveling speed @xmath53 .    according to the expected pulse speed does not depend upon the total number of cells when the response function is stiff .",
    "this can be related to a recent work by mittal _",
    "@xcite where the authors observe experimentally such a fact in a different context ( see section [ sec : cluster ] below ) . in the case of a smooth tumbling kernel in",
    ", our model would predict a dependency of the speed upon the quantity of cells .",
    "but this analysis suggests that the number of cells is presumably not a sensitive biophysical parameter .",
    "observe that the speed does not depend on the bacterial diffusion coefficient either .",
    "therefore we expect to get the same formula if we follow the hyperbolic approach of @xcite in order to derive a macroscopic model . indeed the main difference at the macroscopic level lies in the diffusion coefficient which is very small in the hyperbolic system .",
    "nevertheless , the density distribution would be very different , being much more confined in the hyperbolic system .",
    "furthermore , scaling back the system to its original variables , we would obtain a pulse speed being comparable to the individual speed of bacteria ( see appendix ) .",
    "this is clearly not the case .",
    "mittal _ et al .",
    "_ have presented remarkable experiments where bacteria _",
    "e. coli _ self - organize in coherent aggregated structures due to chemotaxis @xcite .",
    "the cluster diameters are shown essentially not to depend on the quantity of cells being trapped .",
    "this experimental observation can be recovered from direct numerical simulations of random walks @xcite .",
    "we can recover this feature in our context using a model similar to derived from a kinetic description .",
    "following section [ sec : analytical ] we compute the solutions of in the absence of nutrient ( assuming again a stiff response function ) . observe that stationary solutions correspond here to zero - speed traveling pulses .",
    "the problem is reduced to finding solutions of the following system : @xmath54 we assume again that @xmath55 .",
    "this simply leads to , @xmath56 this is compatible with the postulate that @xmath57 changes sign only once , at @xmath58 ( the source @xmath59 being even ) .",
    "the typical size of the clusters is of the order @xmath60 , which does not depend on the total number of cells .",
    "this is in good agreement with experiments exhibited in @xcite .",
    "the fact that we can recover them from numerical simulations indicates that these stationary states are expected to be stable .",

    "we introduce the deviation to the stationary state : @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",

    "we can draw the following main conclusions from numerical experiments .      when the stiffness assumption for the internal response function is relaxed , no pulse propagation is observed numerically . deriving the exact conditions that guarantee the propagation of a traveling pulse seems to be a challenging task .",

    "we learn from section [ sec : cluster ] that the stiffness parameter @xmath61 plays an important role in the stability of the homogeneous solution .",

    "this is well understood in two dimensions of space for instance @xcite .",
    "if some nondimensional parameter is small enough , diffusion dominates and no self - organization arises in the system . on the contrary , self - attraction between cells overcomes diffusion when this parameter is large , and yields the formation of a singularity ( _ i.e. _ aggregation point ) @xcite .",

    "solitary modes with smaller amplitudes may appear at the back of the leading one ( not shown ) . to predict which fraction of mass starts traveling turns out to be a difficult question .",
    "we present in this article a simple mathematical description for the collective motion of bacterial pulses with constant speed and asymmetric profile in a channel .",
    "the nature of this model significantly differs from the classical keller - segel system although it belongs to the same class of drift - diffusion equations .",
    "our model is formally derived from a mesoscopic description of the bacterial density , which allows for a more accurate expression of the cell flux .",
    "we are able to compute analytically the speed of the pulse and its profile in the limit of a stiff response function @xmath15 .",
    "the theoretical pulse speed has some striking features : it does not depend on the total number of bacteria , neither on the bacterial diffusion coefficient .",
    "this can be related to experimental evidence by mittal _",
    "@xcite where bacteria self - organize into size - independent clusters .",
    "our approach can be summarized as follows : a nutrient is added to pull chemotactic clusters of cells .",
    "this creates an imbalance in the fluxes which induces the asymmetry of the traveling profile",
    ".    the next step would be to work at the kinetic level .",
    "much has to be done for the design of efficient kinetic schemes for the collective motion of cells subject to chemotactic interactions .",
    "it would also be feasible to point out the dependency of the tumbling operator upon some internal variable ( _ e.g. _ the cytoplasmic concentration of protein chey ) .",
    "this approach carries out the coupling between an internal protein network and the external chemoattractant signals @xcite .",
    "kinetic models are also relevant for describing this microscopic mechanism @xcite ( the network is basically transported along the cells trajectories ) .",
    "however the increase in complexity forces to reduce the size of the network , and to use rather caricatural systems mimicking high sensitivity to small temporal variations ( excitation ) and adaptation to constant levels of the chemoattractant .    assuming independent integration of the chemical signals constitutes a strong hypothesis of our model .",
    "there exist two main membranous receptors triggering chemotaxis , namely tar and tsr .",
    "as the signals which act in the present experiments are not perfectly determined , we have considered the simplest configuration .",

    "the classical theory of drift - diffusion limit for kinetic modeling of bacterial chemotaxis is a way to compute the macroscopic fluxes @xmath9 , @xmath10 in @xcite . because we assume a linear integration of the different signals for each individual , we restrict ourselves to the action of a single chemical species @xmath12 .",
