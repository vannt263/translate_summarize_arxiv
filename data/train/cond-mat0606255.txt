    "already the superposition of two standing - wave lattices of different wavelengths leads to a superlattice with a spatial modulation of the lattice well depths .",

    "first experimental results @xcite using an admixture of a fermionic species to a bose - einstein condensate in an optical lattice reveal first effects of the inter - species interactions on the matter - wave interference pattern .",

    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we investigate the effect of non - uniform lattice potentials  a simple two - colour superlattice in our case  on the phase diagram of binary bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "second , we introduce a physically motivated basis truncation scheme to extend the calculations to experimentally relevant system sizes .",
    "the basic formulation of the model and benchmark results for purely bosonic systems are summarized in sections [ secbfh ] and [ singleb ] , respectively",

    ", we introduce an adaptive basis truncation scheme , which reduces the many - body basis to the physically relevant states .",
    "the truncation scheme is discussed in section [ truncationscheme ] and a first application to bosons in superlattices is presented in section [ secfinite ] .",

    "@xcite . in extension of these studies , we are going to discuss the impact of spatial lattice modulations on the phase diagram of boson - fermion mixtures . in the simplest case",
    "we assume a two - colour superlattice potential , generated by a superposition of two standing - wave lattices of different wavelengths . provided",
    "the lattice is sufficiently deep , i.e. , the gap between the ground and first excited band is sufficiently large , we can restrict ourselves to the lowest energy band @xcite .",

    "one of the major advantages of exact diagonalization techniques is their applicability throughout the whole phase diagram , from the coherent superfluid regime to the strongly correlated mott - insulator @xcite .",
    "the price for this universality is the restriction to moderate system sizes due to the huge basis dimensions .",
    "our aim is to increase the computationally feasible system sizes by a physically motivated , adaptive truncation scheme , which selects the important basis states for a certain region of the phase diagram out of the complete basis .",
    "this allows us to approach the experimentally relevant system sizes , to check for finite size effects , and to use the truncated basis in time - dependent simulations @xcite .",

    "this is the onset of the quasi bose - glass phase , where the interplay of lattice irregularities and interaction causes redistributions of the particles within the system .",
    "these redistributions of the particles also manifest in increasing number fluctuations @xmath34 shown in figure [ cmax1](b ) . throughout the phase diagram",
    "one can clearly identify the complementary behaviour of @xmath31 and the number fluctuations @xmath28 .",
    "the lobes result from the finite differences of the on - site energies in the superlattice potential ( compare figure [ sl ] ) . in the limit of an infinite lattice with random disorder",
    "these stable regions will vanish and the genuine bose - glass phase will emerge .",
    "another characteristic regime is the localized phase in which all particles are gathered at the deepest lattice well of each super - cell .",
    "it is obvious that this phase only exists at very small interaction strengths .",
    "the effect of localization due to disorder in the lattice is called _ anderson localization _ @xcite .",
    "one possible way to extend these direct solutions of the eigenvalue problem to larger systems consists in a controlled and physically motivated truncation of the underlying basis .",
    "the challenge is to decide which number states are important and which can be discarded from the outset . as an example consider a system deep within the mott - insulating phase .",
    "number states with several particles at one particular lattice site are associated with very large interaction energies and their contribution to the ground state is negligible . those less important number states can be omitted from the beginning , leading to a significant reduction of the basis dimension .    a simple but very efficient a priori measure for the importance of individual number states is the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the following inequality is used to select the relevant basis states : @xmath35 hence , number states associated with interaction or on - site energy contributions above a specific truncation energy @xmath36 are discarded . by varying the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and",
    "@xmath15 one can optimize the basis for a particular region of the phase diagram . by varying the truncation energy @xmath36",
    "one can adjust the size of the remaining basis and at the same time assess the truncation errors .",
    "the truncation scheme works particularly well in regions where the ground state is composed of a few dominant basis states , i.e. in regions of large @xmath31 . on the other hand , in regions where almost all number states contribute significantly , e.g. in the superfluid phase",
    ", the truncation scheme will be less reliable .",
    "the generation of the truncated basis starts from a reference number state that minimizes the energy expectation value .",
    "with respect to this reference state , multiple particle - hole excitations are generated until the new states violate the inequality ( [ trunc ] ) . if the truncation energy @xmath36 is large enough , this process generates the complete set of number states .    as a first benchmark",
    ", we study the effect of the basis truncation for the single - component bose gas discussed earlier . for the sake of clarity and simplicity the interaction energy",
    "is fixed at @xmath37 .",
    "the calculations performed with the complete basis are compared to calculations with two different truncation levels .",

    "the strong truncation includes 3-particle3-hole excitations with respect to an appropriate reference state chosen for the particular region in the phase diagram .",
    "the remaining dimension is about 0.3% of the complete basis . for the basis with moderate truncation ,",
    "higher - order excitations are also included .",
    "nevertheless , the dimensions of the moderate truncated basis is still reduced to 4% of the complete basis .",

    ". further increase of the superlattice amplitude leads to the onset of the quasi bose - glass phase , where a pattern of regions with small values of @xmath39 and large number fluctuations and regions with small number fluctuations and large values of @xmath39 emerges as depicted in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ obs1 ] .",
    "the differences between the calculations with the full and the truncated basis are barely visible . only for the strongly truncated basis with 0.3% of the full basis dimension ,",
    "noticeable deviations occur .",
    "the basis using a moderate truncation to 4% of the full dimension yields results which are practically identical to the full calculation .",
    "a well - defined observable is the fraction of particles that undergo bose - einstein condensation .",

    "the exact calculation yields @xmath45 , for the moderate truncation @xmath46 and for the strong truncation @xmath47 .",
    "it is an intrinsic feature of the truncation to underestimate the condensate fraction because of the number states that are missed during the calculation of the one - body density - matrix elements .",
    "the kink in figure [ obs1](c ) at @xmath48 ( dashed line ) is due to the change of the basis at this point ( see table [ tabular ] ) . in principle",

    "the results of the full basis and the truncated basis with 4 % of the full dimension coincide almost everywhere.[obs1],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    an observable that is directly accessible to the experiment is the matter - wave interference pattern after release from the lattice and free expansion .",
    "after switching off the confining potential , the intensity of the matter - wave at a point @xmath49 can be written as @xcite @xmath50 since we are not interested in the spatial envelope of the interference pattern , the amplitude operator @xmath51 depends only on the phase @xmath52 acquired on the way from site @xmath6 to the observation point @xmath49 , @xmath53 considering microscopic distances between the lattice sites and a macroscopic distance from the lattice to the observation point , we assume a constant phase difference between adjacent sites @xmath54 .",
    "this far - field limit leads to the following expression for the matter - wave intensity : @xmath55 in which we used equation ( [ obdm ] ) .",
    "this expression is closely related to the quasi - momentum distribution . if @xmath56 is equal to one of the possible quasi - momenta @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , we obtain the respective quasi - momentum occupation numbers .",
    "exemplarily figure [ pattern1 ] shows the matter - wave interference pattern for three values of the superlattice amplitude @xmath15 in the vicinity of the transition point from the homogenous mott - insulator to the quasi bose - glass phase . from the sequence of interference patterns",
    "one can see that the height of the peak at quasi - momentum @xmath59 reaches a maximum at @xmath60 with an absolute value smaller than the condensate occupation number .",
    "note that in a regular lattice the condensate wave function ",
    "the lowest natural orbital  is identical to the quasi - momentum zero bloch function .",
    "hence , in that case the occupation of the quasi - momentum zero mode is equal to the lowest eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix .",
    "this relation does not hold for irregular lattice potentials .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as already mentioned , the truncation scheme is expected to deviate most from the complete calculations if a large number of basis states is necessary to represent the ground state . but even in the transition region , where this occurs , less than 1% of the complete set of number states is sufficient to reproduce the properties of the system qualitatively .",
    "the basis including 4% of the complete set of number states included shows virtually no deviation from the exact calculation .",
    "it seems that the estimate ( [ trunc ] ) is a suitable a priori measure to select the physically relevant number states .",
    "it is obvious that the more irregular the optical lattice is , the less energetically similar number states exist and the better the truncation scheme works .",
    "as a first application of the truncated basis in a regime where calculations with the full basis are not feasible anymore , we study the impact of finite size effects for a single - component bose gas in a superlattice . to this end , we extend the two - colour lattice to three and four super - cells , corresponding to a problem of 15 bosons on 15 lattice sites ( @xmath61 ) and 20 bosons on 20 lattice sites ( @xmath62 ) , respectively . we employ truncations to 1% and 0.001% of the respective full basis dimensions .     system with 3 super - cells , right : @xmath63 system with 4 super - cells .

    "they can be compared to the result of the full calculation for a system of two super - cells shown in figure [ pattern1 ] .",
    "the matter - wave interference patterns seem to be barely affected by the truncation and are of the same general shape for all system sizes . only the increasing number of possible quasimomenta @xmath66 with @xmath67 is reflected in the substructure of the interference peaks .",
    "figure [ pattern2 ] also demonstrates the dependence of the condensate fraction on @xmath38 at fixed @xmath37 for the truncated three and four super - cell system .",
    "the comparison with the complete calculation for the two super - cell system displayed in figure [ cmax1 ] reveals that the condensate fraction is generally reduced .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold : first , the basis truncation leads to an underestimation of the condensate fraction as discussed in section [ truncationscheme ] .",
    "second , finite size effects are relevant for the condensate fraction . the simplest indication for this results from the existence of a lower bound for @xmath43 which is proportional to @xmath68 . the largest eigenvalue @xmath40 of the one - body density matrix ( [ condfrac ] ) , which defines the condensate fraction , has a lower bound which results from the normalization of the one - body density matrix : @xmath69 hence",
    ", the smallest possible value for the condensate fraction is given by @xmath70 .",
    "for the genuine mott - insulating phase in a regular lattice of increasing size the condensate fraction would go to zero like @xmath68 . in agreement with this intrinsic size dependence , the condensate fraction within the mott - insulating phase shown in figure [ pattern2 ] tends to smaller values .    from these investigations",
    "we can conclude , that for the major observables finite size effects are under control and that calculations performed in small systems are well suited for qualitative and even semi - quantitative predictions for larger systems .",

    "all number states with    few particles per site are favoured since the strong boson - fermion    repulsion suppresses states with different species occupying the same    site .",

    "only three areas with a significant condensate fraction are visible . in the lower left corner  at small boson - fermion interaction strengths and superlattice amplitudes ",

    "might confirm their observation . with increasing interaction strength",
    "@xmath14 the visibility also decreases rapidly .",

    "the basis truncation scheme that was introduced in section [ truncationscheme ] , can also be applied to bose - fermi mixtures . before going to larger systems , we repeat the calculations of the previous section for a @xmath26 , @xmath71 boson - fermion mixture using a truncated basis .",
    "the truncation of the basis again makes use of the importance criterion ( [ trunc ] ) . for the present example",
    "the basis dimension is reduced to @xmath92 , thus about 15% of the number states of the complete basis are kept .",
    "we use this rather large set because the phase diagram is not partitioned into several areas with different optimized bases  for simplicity , only one basis optimized for @xmath93 is employed .",
    "of course , one can also work with an optimized basis for each point or for particular regions of the phase diagram .     and",
    "@xmath26 for fixed @xmath73 calculated with a truncated basis of roughly 15% of the full dimension .",
    "( a ) condensate fraction @xmath43 of the bosonic species .",
    "( b ) fringe visibility @xmath81 of the bosonic species .",
    "the comparison with figure [ cond2 ] illustrates the quality of the truncated calculation.[cond3],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    for brevity , we only consider the condensate fraction and the fringe visibility , as shown in figure [ cond3 ] , for the truncated calculations .",
    "the general structure of the phase diagram of figure [ cond2 ] is well - reproduced with the truncated basis .",
    "the absolute value of the condensate fraction is underestimated in the truncated calculation as was discussed earlier . in close connection to this ,",
    "the narrow stripe at the top left of figure [ cond3](b ) shows a significantly smaller visibility @xmath81 than in the complete calculation .",
    "this is because number states with many particles at the same lattice sites are discarded by the truncation scheme due to the optimization to a region , where also the boson - fermion interaction plays a significant role .",
    "although the coefficients @xmath94 of the missing number states would have been small , their contribution to the off - diagonal elements of the one - body density matrix is sizable .",
    "their omission causes a reduction of coherence and thus the reduced visibility of the interference fringes .    despite the quantitative deviations in some special regions in the phase - diagram , its global structure can be fully described by the truncated basis . naturally , the use of adapted bases in the different characteristic regions in the phase diagram would improve the quantitative agreement",
    "finally , we investigate a system with @xmath95 particles and @xmath26 lattice sites . the complete basis for this system",
    "consists of @xmath96 number states . for the presented calculations a truncation to 22% of the complete basis is used .    , @xmath95 .",
    "left panel : maximum coefficient @xmath31 in the expansion of number states , right panel : mean occupation numbers @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) of the bosonic ( fermionic ) species .",
    "[ cond4 ] the boson - boson interaction energy is fixed at @xmath73.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the maximum coefficient @xmath31 , depicted in figure [ cond4 ] as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath38 for fixed @xmath73 , reveals a phase diagram with a structure different from the half - filling case shown in figure [ cmax2 ] .",
    "the most significant difference is the absence of the mott - insulator - like phase in the lower part of the phase diagram . even in the limit of very strong repulsive interactions ,",
    "a homogeneous mott - insulator phase is not possible , since there are always lattice sites occupied with more than one particle due to the incommensurate filling . for this reason in region ( a ) , where the boson - fermion interaction is negligible compared to the boson - boson repulsion",
    ", pairs of bosons and fermions occupy the lattice with a distribution following the topology of the superlattice .",
    "an increase of the superlattice amplitude ( region ( b ) ) leads to a bosonic double occupancy of the deepest superlattice wells , whereas the fermions are forced to spread over several sites with mean occupation numbers less than or equal to one .",
    "the horizontal line , which appeared in the half - filling case for superlattice amplitudes @xmath15 equal to the boson - boson interaction strength @xmath13 , vanishes because of the incommensurability . for strong boson - fermion repulsion , any slight irregularity of the lattice ",
    "i.e . a small nonzero superlattice amplitude",
    " leads to multiple boson occupancies at the deeper lattice sites .",
    "a comparison of the mean occupation numbers at ( c ) and ( d ) or at ( e ) and ( f ) shows that if the boson - fermion interaction exceeds the boson - boson interaction , the mean occupation numbers are stable against increasing superlattice amplitude .",
    "however , at the same time the increasing value of @xmath31 indicates that the number fluctuations decrease successively .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram of binary boson - fermion mixtures in optical superlattices . for the symmetric half - filled system we identified a homogenous mott - insulator - like phase at small superlattice amplitudes and strong repulsive interactions within the bosonic species and between the bosonic and the fermionic component .",
    "a phase of complete localization of the bosonic species can be realized already for moderate superlattice amplitudes if the boson - fermion repulsion clearly exceeds the boson - boson repulsion .",
    "these `` localized condensates '' are of a different nature than the genuine bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices as indicated by the absence of matter - wave interference fringes .",
    "the phase - diagram of a boson - fermion mixture beyond half - filling is less structured , since the homogeneous mott - insulator phase at small superlattice amplitudes is absent . in the region of strong boson - fermion interaction any slight irregularity within the lattice immediately leads to double occupancies of the deeper site . for increasing superlattice amplitude , the mean occupation numbers are almost unaltered , only the number fluctuations decrease .",
    "part of the calculations were performed using a controlled basis truncation scheme tailored to select the physically important basis states out of the complete set .",
    "this versatile tool allows to increase the particle numbers and lattice sizes accessible to diagonalization techniques . by explicit comparison with full calculations",
    ", we have shown that truncated bases containing only about one percent of the number states , already provide quantitatively reliable results .",
    "the simplicity of the basis truncation facilitates time - dependent calculations for systems of moderate size , as will be discussed in a separate publication @xcite .",
