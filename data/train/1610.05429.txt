    "in qcd the strong interaction among quarks depends on their color charge . when quarks are placed in a medium , this color charge is screened due density and temperature effects  @xcite .",
    "if the density and/or the temperature increases beyond a certain critical value , one expects that the interactions between quarks no longer confine them inside a hadron , so that they are free to travel longer distances and deconfine .",
    "this transition from a confined to a deconfined phase is usually referred to as the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "a separate phase transition takes place when the realization of chiral symmetry shifts from a nambu - goldstone phase to a wigner - weyl phase .",
    "based , on lattice qcd evidence  @xcite one expects these two phase transitions to take place at approximately the same temperature at zero chemical potential . at finite density",
    "these two transitions can arise at different critical temperatures .",
    "the result will be a quarkyonic phase , where the chiral symmetry is restored but the quarks and gluons remains confined .    in order to characterize the properties of these phase transitions it has been customary to study the behavior of corresponding order parameters as functions of the temperature @xmath2 and the baryon chemical potential @xmath3 , namely the trace of the polyakov loop ( pl ) @xmath1 ( deconfinement phase transition ) and",
    "quark anti - quark chiral condensate @xmath5 ( chiral symmetry restoration ) , respectively .",
    "another important parameter in the discussion of these phase transitions is the role that an external magnetic field may play , inducing changes in the critical temperature , in the location of the critical end point , etc  @xcite .",
    "however , in this work we will not refer to magnetic field effects , since the goal of our discussion is to compare the polyakov loop order parameter with another qcd deconfinement parameter that has been introduced in the literature  @xcite in the form of the squared energy threshold , @xmath0 , for the onset of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in hadronic spectral functions . for an actual general review",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . around this energy , and at zero temperature , the resonance peaks in the spectrum are either no longer present or become very broad .",
    "the smooth hadronic spectral function thus approaches the pqcd regime . with increasing temperature approaching the critical temperature for deconfinement , one would expect hadrons to disappear from the spectral function which should then be described entirely by pqcd .    when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are nonzero , lattice qcd simulations can not be used , because of the sign problem in the fermionic determinant",
    ". therefore , one need to resort either to mathematical constructions to overcome the above limitation , or to model calculations .",
    "the two deconfinement order parameters mentioned before : the trace of the pl ( @xmath1 ) and the continuum threshold ( @xmath4 ) can be used to realize a phenomenological description of the deconfinement transition at finite temperature and density .    the natural framework to determine @xmath4 has been that of qcd sum rules  @xcite .",
    "this quantum field theory framework is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of current correlators at short distances , extended beyond perturbation theory , and on cauchy s theorem in the complex @xmath6-plane .",
    "the latter is usually referred to as quark - hadron duality .",
    "vacuum expectation values of quark and gluon field operators effectively parametrize the effects of confinement . an extension of this method to finite temperature was first outlined in  @xcite .",
    "further evidence supporting the validity of this program was provided in  @xcite , followed by a large number of applications  @xcite .    to analyze the role of the pl",
    ", we will concentrate on nonlocal polyakov@xmath7nambu@xmath7jona - lasinio ( nlpnjl ) models  @xcite , in which quarks move in a background color field and interact through covariant nonlocal chirally symmetric four point couplings .",
    "these approaches , which can be considered as an improvement over the ( local ) pnjl model  @xcite , offer a common framework to study both the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions .",
    "in fact , the nonlocal character of the interactions arises naturally in the context of several successful approaches to low - energy quark dynamics  @xcite , and leads to a momentum dependence in the quark propagator that can be made consistent  @xcite with lattice results  @xcite .    in view of the above mentioned points",
    ", the aim of the present work is to study the relation between both order parameters for the deconfinement transition at finite temperature and chemical potential , @xmath1 and @xmath4 , using the thermal finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) with inputs obtained from nlpnjl models .",
    "we begin by considering the ( charged ) axial - vector current correlator at @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the axial - vector current , @xmath11 is the four - momentum transfer , and the functions @xmath12 are free of kinematical singularities . concentrating on the function @xmath13 and writing the ope beyond perturbation theory in qcd @xcite , one of the two pillars of the sum rule method , one has @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a renormalization scale .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath16 depend on the lorentz indices and quantum numbers of the currents .",
    "finally , the local gauge invariant operators @xmath17 , are built from the quark and gluon fields in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of those operators ( @xmath18 ) , dubbed as condensates , parameterize nonperturbative effects and have to be extracted from experimental data or model calculations .",
    "these operators are ordered by increasing dimensionality and the wilson coefficients , calculable in pqcd , fall off by corresponding powers of @xmath19 .",
    "the unit operator above has dimension @xmath20 and @xmath21 stands for the purely perturbative contribution .",
    "hence , this ope factorizes short distance physics , encapsulated in the wilson coefficients , and long distance effects parametrized by the vacuum condensates .",
    "the second pillar of the qcd sum rules technique is cauchy s theorem in the complex squared energy @xmath6-plane @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary analytic function , and the radius of the circle @xmath4 is large enough for qcd and the ope to be used on the circle .",
    "the integral along the real @xmath6-axis involves the hadronic spectral function .",
    "this equation is the mathematical statement of what is usually referred to as quark - hadron duality . using the ope , eq.([ope ] ) , and an integration kernel @xmath24",

    "however , the analysis to be reported here is performed at lower values of @xmath2 , so that we can safely ignore this contribution in the sequel .",
    "the dimension @xmath30 term , a renormalization group invariant quantity , is given by @xmath31 the leading power correction of dimension @xmath32 is the four - quark condensate , which in the vacuum saturation approximation  @xcite becomes @xmath33 which has a very mild dependence on the renormalization scale .",
    "this approximation has no solid theoretical justification , other than its simplicity .",
    "hence , there is no reliable way of estimating corrections , which in fact appear to be rather large from comparisons between eq .",
    "( [ c6 ] ) and direct determinations from data  @xcite .",
    "the extension of this program to finite temperature is fairly straightforward  @xcite , with the wilson coefficients in the ope , eq.([ope ] ) , remaining independent of @xmath2 at leading order in @xmath34 , and the condensates developing a temperature dependence .",
    "radiative corrections in qcd involve now an additional scale , i.e. the temperature , so that @xmath35 . this problem has not yet been solved successfully .",
    "nevertheless , from the size of radiative corrections at @xmath8 one does not expect any major loss of accuracy in results from thermal fesr to leading order in pqcd , as long as the temperature is not too high , say @xmath36 .",
    "essentially all applications of fesr at @xmath37 have been done at leading order in pqcd , thus implying a systematic uncertainty at the level of 10 % .    in the static limit ( @xmath38 ) , to leading order in pqcd , and for @xmath39 and @xmath40 the function @xmath41 in eq.([correlator ] ) becomes @xmath42 ; to simplify the notation we shall omit the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependence in the sequel .",

    "the fact that both deconfinement temperatures are smaller than the chiral critical temperature is in agreement with other analysis .    at finite chemical potential",
    ", we find that for both deconfinement parameters , beyond the critical end point chemical potential , the system remains in its confined phase even when the chiral symmetry is restored .",
