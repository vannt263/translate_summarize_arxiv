    "an isolated conducting ring in its quantum ground state ( or , at finite temperature , in thermal equilibrium ) supports a non - zero current whenever the magnetic flux @xmath3 that it encloses is a non - integer multiple of the flux quantum @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this equilibrium current is known as persistent current , and reflects the sensitivity of the electron wavefunction phase to the ring s topology and the flux @xmath3 . as a result , persistent current can only be observed if the electron phase coherence length is greater than the ring s circumference .",
    "persistent current has been a topic of considerable interest since it was first predicted to be observable in microfabricated rings @xcite . in disordered metal rings with circumference @xmath5 1 @xmath1 m its magnitude",
    "is predicted to be roughly @xmath5 1 na , and to be suppressed on a temperature scale @xmath5 1 k @xcite .",
    "the current exists only within the closed ring , and so can not be measured using conventional ammeters .",
    "instead , experiments have mostly inferred it by measuring its magnetic moment ( or related quantities ) .",
    "this presents a substantial technical challenge , as the magnetic moment produced by the persistent current in such a ring is typically @xmath6 .",
    "persistent current can be distinguished from many background signals because it oscillates as a function of @xmath3 with period @xmath7 .",
    "more specifically , in an isolated disordered metal ring it is given by    @xmath8    where the fourier amplitudes @xmath9 are random variables drawn from probability distribution functions that are very nearly gaussian @xcite .",
    "( the randomness arises from the lack of control over the microscopic details of the ring ) .",
    "each of these distributions is characterized by a mean value @xmath10 and a width @xmath11 .    for non - interacting electrons , the mean values",
    "@xmath10 are predicted to be very small @xcite ( well below the sensitivity of existing instruments ) . as a result",
    ", the current in a particular ring will have fourier amplitudes with random signs and magnitudes of the order of @xmath12 , and the total signal from an array of @xmath13 rings will be proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath11 decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath15 , so @xmath16 tends to be dominated by the @xmath17 term @xcite .",
    "thus , the signal from an array of @xmath13 rings will have period @xmath7 and amplitude @xmath18 .",
    "the magnitude of the typical current @xmath19 is set by the thouless energy , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the diffusion constant and @xmath22 the ring circumference . at low temperature ( @xmath23 ,",
    "where @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 @xcite",
    ".    for interacting electrons calculations predict that the average value of the second fourier amplitude is greatly enhanced @xcite .",
    "specifically , ambegaokar and eckern found that a hartree - fock treatment including a screened coulomb interaction yields @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 ) with the effective electron - electron coupling constant @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "for repulsive electron - electron interactions @xmath29 , corresponding to paramagnetic susceptibility around @xmath30 .",
    "for attractive electron - electron interactions ( such as in a superconductor above the critical temperature ) @xmath31 , corresponding to diamagnetic susceptibility around @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "thus for interacting electrons , the signal from an array of @xmath13 rings is expected to be dominated by oscillations with period @xmath32 and amplitude @xmath33 .",
    "we emphasize that the interactions considered here are between the electrons in an individual ring .",
    "interactions between rings in the array are assumed to be negligible .",
    "this interaction - based enhancement of @xmath34 is predicted to be suppressed by modest magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "specifically , when the magnetic flux through the metal of the ring @xmath35 ( distinct from the flux @xmath3 through the hole in the ring ) satisfies @xmath36 , the enhancement vanishes and the persistent current is expected to be described by the non - interacting model .    to date , several measurements on arrays of rings @xcite have been interpreted as showing a diamagnetic persistent current with period @xmath32 and an amplitude that is comparable to ( but somewhat larger than ) @xmath37 as predicted by ambegaokar and eckern @xcite .",
    "these results have been obtained on arrays of rings made of au @xcite , gaas @xcite , and ag @xcite .",
    "measurements of cu rings found similar signals , but did not determine the sign @xcite . interpreting these results within the ambegaokar and eckern theory would require the electron - electron interactions in these materials to be attractive .",
    "this is in apparent disagreement with the absence of a superconducting phase in these materials , as well as with other measurements ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "some possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy have been proposed .",
    "these include a non - zero ( but very low ) superconducting transition temperature for some of these materials which is further suppressed by magnetic impurities within the ring @xcite , as well as nonequilibrium effects due to high - frequency electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however to date there is not a complete understanding of what role these effects might play in the measurements of @xmath38 reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we describe the fabrication and characterization of a new type of device for measuring @xmath34 .",
    "each device consists of a large array of au rings supported on a micromechanical cantilever . in the presence of an applied magnetic field persistent current in the rings",
    "will experience a torque , which in turn can be sensed as a static displacement of the cantilever or as a shift in the cantilever s resonant frequency .",
    "these devices will complement in a number of ways the squid - based and microwave - resonator - based detectors used in previous measurements of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "first , they will measure persistent current ( pc ) in the presence of a somewhat larger magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field must be large enough to generate a measurable torque , but small enough that @xmath35 is not much larger than @xmath39 ; as described below , this will correspond to 0.05 t @xmath40 0.25 t. in contrast , previous measurements of @xmath34 were made with @xmath41 0.01 t. second , the mechanical detectors described here will not produce high - frequency electromagnetic fields .",
    "this is in contrast to previous experiments , in which high - frequency fields were produced either as part of the measurement @xcite or as a consequence of josephson oscillations in the squid junctions @xcite .",
    "mechanical detectors similar to the ones described here were used previously to measure the persistent current in al rings in large @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath42 used in refs .",
    "@xcite completely suppressed the superconductivity of the al , and resulted in torsional signals with large signal - to - noise ratio ( even for samples consisting of a single ring @xcite ) .",
    "however the large @xmath42 ensured that @xmath43 , and so precluded the observation of the interaction effects predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite . the devices described here incorporate a number of changes from those used in refs .",
    "first , the number of rings on a cantilever is increased by roughly three orders of magnitude to @xmath44 rings .",
    "second , the rings dimensions are chosen to minimize @xmath35 for a given @xmath42 . finally , the al that was used in refs .",
    "@xcite ( and which is a superconductor at low @xmath42 ) is replaced by au . to avoid proximity effects from commonly - used sticking layers ( many of which are superconductors ) ,",
    "the au rings described here are deposited directly onto a silicon wafer .",
    "the process starts from a @xmath45 silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) 4-inch wafer ( see fig . [",
    "fabstages]a ) .",
    "the 120 nm thick silicon device layer will eventually form the cantilevers after the underlying 400 nm thick box ( buried silicon oxide ) and 400 @xmath1 m thick silicon handle layers are etched away .",
    "a layer of silicon nitride ( 200 nm ) followed by a layer of silicon oxide ( 750 nm ) is deposited by pecvd ( plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ) on the handle layer ( fig . [ fabstages]b ) .",
    "these layers will be patterned into an etch mask .",
    "( the use of a bilayer provides stress compensation . )    to pattern the cantilevers , standard photolithograpy is used to define a photoresist mask on the device layer , followed by a cf@xmath46 reactive ion etch ( rie ) ( fig . [",
    "fabstages]c ) .",
    "then a second photolithographic mask is defined on the back side of the wafer .",
    "this mask is aligned with the cantilever pattern on the front side of the wafer .",
    "the pattern is transferred to the oxide and nitride layers by a chf@xmath47/o@xmath48 rie ( fig . [ fabstages]d ) . in later steps these layers will serve as a hard mask for a wet etch .    to produce the rings , a mma - maa / pmma bi - layer with a 270 nm/140 nm aspect ratio is spun on the device layer and exposed by an electron beam .",
    "the pattern is developed in mibk / ipa at 25@xmath49c for 50 s. 50 nm of 6n - purity gold is then deposited in an evaporator which has never evaporated magnetic materials .",
    "lift - off is done in nmp at 80@xmath49c ( fig . [ fabstages]e ) .    to protect the gold rings during the wet etch of the handle layer ,",
    "they are covered with koh - resistant pro - tek b3 coating and the wafer is mounted on a specially made chuck which provides leak - tight coverage of the top side of the wafer .",
    "the silicon handle is then etched in a 30@xmath50 water solution of koh at 85@xmath49c for approximately 4 hours at the rate of @xmath51 @xmath1m / h ( fig . [ fabstages]f ) . as the etch rate depends on the etchant concentration and temperature , and varies for different crystalographic axes of silicon , it is important to make sure that the solution is homogeneous ( by constant stirring ) and temperature stable ( controlled by a feedback loop on the heater ) throughout .",
    "the etch is quenched in water once the the box etch - stop layer is reached .",
    "the pro - tek layer covering the front side of the wafer was found to be important in preventing the koh from passing through small cracks in the box layer .",
    "the last step of the process is to release the cantilevers from the pro - tek film and box etch - stop layer .",
    "the sio@xmath48 layer is removed by immersing the chips in a 6:1 h@xmath48o : hf solution with surfactant ohs ( fig . [",
    "fabstages]g ) .",
    "the pro - tek film is then removed in nmp heated to 80@xmath49c .",
    "the chips are transferred in fluid from nmp to acetone , methanol and finally isopropanol and critical point dried ( fig .",
    "[ fabstages]h ) .",
    "occasionally the pro - tek layer can leave small amounts of residue on the cantilevers which are easily removed by a short cf@xmath46/o@xmath48 ( 5:45 sccm ) rie clean after the cantilevers are fully suspended .",
    "optical and sem images of fabricated devices can be seen in figure [ samplephoto ] .",
    "the cantilevers ( green ) are",
    "all about 500 @xmath1 m long and 100 @xmath1 m to 1 mm wide .",
    "the rings are in fact squares as this shape is faster to pattern with the e - beam writer .",
    "the square sides are 250 nm long and 50 nm wide .",
    "the spacing between adjacent squares sides is 400 nm .",
    "the sample is placed in the vacuum space of a @xmath52he fridge with 300 mk base temperature and an 8 t superconducting magnet .",
    "the cantilever deflection is detected with a fiber - optic interferometer @xcite using a 1550 nm laser .",
    "the interferometer signal is used as an input to a phase - locked loop , which in turn drives the cantilever at its resonant frequency ( via a piezoelectric element ) .",
    "the frequency of this drive is monitored , and is used to infer the persistent current in the rings : as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the change of the cantilever resonant frequency as function of field is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ freqscan ] shows a measurement of two resonances of a cantilever that is 500 @xmath1 m long , 300 @xmath1 m wide and 120 nm thick .",
    "the cantilever supports an array of @xmath0 rings .",
    "this measurement is performed by applying a sinusoidal drive to the piezoelectric element and then using the interferometer to record the amplitude of the cantilever s motion .",
    "the first flexural mode is at 882 hz and the second at 5425 hz . the first torsional mode ( not shown ) is at 4552 hz .",
    "the quality factors @xmath54 of each mode were determined by measuring the ringdown time .",
    "this measurement is performed by driving the cantilever on resonance , then turning off the drive and monitoring the amplitude of the cantilever s motion as function of time .",
    "a typical ringdown measurement at @xmath55 mk and @xmath56 t is shown in figure [ cantilever_ringdown ] .",
    "fitting the data gives @xmath57 .",
    "quality factors of other resonances were similar and they were found not to be strongly affected by the magnetic field .",
    "to estimate the likely signal from @xmath34 , we note that previous experiments on ensembles of rings have found amplitudes @xmath58 @xcite . assuming that @xmath59 in the au rings described above",
    ", we expect this to correspond to 1 na in each ring .",
    "this estimate is based on the transport measurements ( not shown ) of wires deposited from the same source material , which give @xmath60 @xmath61/s .",
    "the estimate @xmath62 na includes the effect of the expected measurement temperature ( @xmath63 mk ) , which results in a @xmath64 reduction of @xmath34 from its @xmath65 value .        where @xmath67 is the cantilever resonant frequency , @xmath68 the spring constant , @xmath69 the cantilever length , @xmath70 the geometrical factor of the order of 1 related to the mode - shape , @xmath71 the surface of the ring , @xmath42 the external magnetic field and @xmath72 the angle between the field and the perpendicular to the ring plane @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath73 , the current of 1 na in @xmath74 rings should produce a frequency shift of @xmath75 @xmath1hz .",
    "figure [ expectedsignal ] shows the expected frequency shift in the field range of interest .",
    "the signal scales as @xmath76 for small fields ( eq . [ eq1 ] ) and then decays at higher fields for which @xmath77 ( here @xmath5 0.2 t ) due to the suppression of the interaction current by flux penetrating the metal of the ring .",
    "this suppression is calculated following ref .",
    "the sign of the current corresponds to the sign of the frequency shift such that @xmath78 would lead to @xmath79 .        where @xmath81 is the measurement time and @xmath82 the maximum displacement of the cantilever @xcite .",
    "if we take @xmath83 s and @xmath84 nm ( typical values for similar measurements @xcite ) we get @xmath85 4 @xmath1hz at 300 mk , shown as the noise floor on fig .",
    "[ expectedsignal ] . as a result",
    ", we expect that these devices will allow for measurement of @xmath34 , and may provide insight into the role of electron - electron interactions in persistent current and weak localization in thermal equilibrium .",
