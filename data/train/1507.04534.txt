    "the first comprehensive analysis of the temporal and spectral x - ray properties of this source was done by @xcite using data from the _ asca _ , _ bepposax _ , _ integral _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories . in particular , _ xmm - newton _ data showed coherent pulsations with a period of around 700  s. joint spectral analysis of _ xmm - newton _ and _ integral _ data demonstrated that the spectral shape is very typical for accretion - powered x - ray pulsars ( namely , an absorbed power law with a high - energy cut - off ) .    based on 2mass archival data , @xcite proposed that the binary companion to 2rxp j130159.6 - 635806 is a be star at a distance of 47  kpc . this suggestion was later confirmed by , who reported the presence of emission lines of hei @xmath42.0594 @xmath5 m and br(74 ) @xmath42.1663 @xmath5 m , which are typical for a be star .",

    "x - ray pulsars in binary systems with be companions ( bexrps ) typically manifest themselves as transient sources through either type i ( periodic flares related to the periastron passage ) or type ii outbursts ( powerful rare transient events ) , or a combination of both .",
    "2rxpj130159.6 - 635806 shows several differences from a standard transient bexrp .",
    "specifically , it has a relatively low persistent flux , a long pulse period , and it does not demonstrate either type i or type ii outbursts .",
    "@xcite , however , did report some variability of its x - ray flux .",
    "therefore , there are substantial reasons to consider 2rxpj130159.6 - 635806 as a member of the subclass of persistent bexrps @xcite .",
    "so far , only a few members of this relatively small category of objects have been studied in detail : 4u  0352 + 309/x  persei , rx  j0146.9 + 6121/ls  i  + 61  235 , rx  j0440.9 + 4431 , and rx  j1037.5 - 564 @xcite .    in this paper , we present results of a comprehensive analysis of the temporal and spectral properties of 2rxpj130159.6 - 635806 in a broad energy range , finding some properties that are very unusual for bexrps .",

    "the most recent measurements by , from 2014 , show the period to be around 643  s ( table  [ tab : log ] ) .",

    "as seen from the fit parameters , the spin - up rate becomes significantly higher after the break . as noted above , the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : period ] shows that the  data points fit the long - term spin - up rate with remarkably high precision .",
    "similar behavior was observed for the x - ray pulsar gx  1 + 4 , which showed steady spin up for more than a decade .",
    "however , gx  1 + 4 belongs to the subclass of accreting x - ray pulsars known as symbiotic x - ray binaries ( syxbs ) . for bexrps ,",
    "persistent sources typically demonstrate pulse periods that are relatively stable .",
    "examples include the population of be systems in the small magellanic cloud @xcite and the well - known low luminosity galactic system x  persei @xcite .",
    "transient bexrps show strong spin - up during type i and type ii outbursts @xcite with significant spin - down episodes in between ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , 2rxp j130159.6 - 635806 is a unique source among the bexrps because it demonstrates steady and high long - term spin - up with a relatively low and stable luminosity .",
    "pulsar pulse profiles and their evolution with luminosity and energy band depend on the geometrical and physical properties of the emitting regions in the vicinity of the neutron star . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pprof ] , the _ nustar _ pulse profiles of rxp  are shown in three different energy bands : 310 , 1020 and 2040 kev .",
    "the lower panel shows `` soft '' ( ( 1020)/(310 ) kev ) and `` hard '' ( ( 2040)/(1020 ) kev ) hardness ratios .    at all energies",
    ", the pulse profile can roughly be divided into one main peak at phases 0.00.5 and two smaller peaks at phases 0.50.75 and 0.751.0 .",
    "the main feature that changes with energy is the depth of the minimum at phase 0.0 . as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pprof ] , while the `` hard '' hardness ratio is almost constant , the `` soft '' hardness ratio shows a maximum at phase 0.0 due to an increase in the depth of the minimum at 310 kev .",
    "such behavior is caused by differences in the source spectrum with pulse phase ( see section 4 ) .    fig .  [ fig : ppfrac ] shows the pulsed fraction as a function of energy .",
    "the pulsed fraction is defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the maximum and minimum intensities in the pulse profile , respectively .",
    "defined in this way , the pulsed fraction is very high ( about 80% ) . the alternative way to characterize",
    "the pulsed fraction is the relative root mean square ( rms ) , which can be calculated using the following equation : @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the background - corrected count rate in a given bin of the pulse profile , @xmath54 is the count rate averaged over the pulse period , and n is the total number of phase bins in the profile ( @xmath55 in our analysis ) .",
    "the @xmath56 deviation obtained in this way reflects the variability of the source pulse profile in a manner that is not sensitive to outliers like the narrow features seen in the profile of rxp .",
    "therefore , this quantity has a value of around 30% that is much lower than the classically determined pulsed fraction and also independent of the energy band ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ppfrac ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in contrast to the majority of x - ray pulsars @xcite , rxp  does not show an increase in the pulsed fraction at higher energies .",
    "such uncharacteristic behavior was previously observed for another persistent bexrp  rxj0440.9 + 4431 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "[ fig : pprof ] shows that the pulsed fraction increases somewhat with energy if @xmath51 is defined from the the pulse plateau rather than from the pulse minimum . in other words , the peak - to - plateau difference slightly grows with energy .",
    "the observed 20-year strong and steady spin - up of rxp  reveals the existence of a long - term accelerating torque , which indicates that the binary interaction must lead to regular accretion over a decade - long time scale , although this could certainly be episodic ( e.g. , at periastron passages ) .",
    "the torque can be transferred by matter accreted from either the disc around the neutron star or a stellar wind from the optical counterpart .",
    "unfortunately , there is no strong observational evidence allowing us to distinguish between these two different accretion channels . in both scenarios ,",
    "this process is defined mainly by the mass accretion rate and the magnetic field strength ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        due to the unknown distance of rxp ,",
    "the luminosity and mass accretion rate are highly uncertain ; the magnetic field is also unknown since no cyclotron line is found in the energy spectrum ( sect .",
    "[ section : spec ] ) .",
    "however , some qualitative conclusions about the interaction between the accretion disk and the neutron star magnetosphere can be made from the noise power spectrum of the x - ray pulsar .    according to the `` perturbation propagation '' model , stochastic variations of viscous stresses in the accretion disc cause variations of the mass accretion rate @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , results in a specific shape of the power density spectrum ( pds ) of the emerging light curve .",
    "namely , it will appear as a power law with slope 1 to 1.5 ( but the exact value is not well established for x - ray pulsars ) up to the break frequency , which is the highest frequency that can be generated in the accretion disk @xcite .    in the case of a highly magnetized neutron star , this maximal frequency",
    "is limited by the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric radius , above which one can expect a cutoff in the source pds .",
    "if the source stays in spin equilibrium ( corotation ) , the cutoff frequency will coincide with the spin frequency of the pulsar , whereas , in the case of spin - up ( increased mass accretion rate ) , the magnetosphere will be squeezed and additional noise will be generated at higher frequencies . if the mass accretion rate is known ( i.e. , the distance to the source",
    "is known ) , this property of the pds can be used to estimate the magnetic field strength of the neutron star .",
    "the appearance of the break in the pds does not necessarily indicate that accretion is from a disk .",
    "there are wind - accreting sources in spin equilibrium also showing a break in their pdss around the pulse frequency @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution of the pds shape aw a function of mass accretion rate in such systems is not well studied .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] , we show the pds of rxp  obtained with the _ nustar _ data in the 4th observation after subtracting the pulse profile folded with the measured period from the light curve .",
    "the solid line represents the fitting model in the form of a broken power law .",
    "the measured break frequency is 0.0066  hz ( shown by dotted line ) , and it is clear that it is shifted towards higher frequencies relative to the spin frequency in this observation ( 0.0015  hz ; shown by dashed vertical line ) .",
    "the power - law slope above the break frequency is fixed at 2 .",
    "the best - fit value of the slope below the break is @xmath57 .",
    "given the steady persistent luminosity , we conclude that the spin - up observed during last @xmath58@xmath59 years is caused by a long - term mass accretion rate that is high enough to squeeze the magnetosphere inside the corotational radius .",
    "this finding confirms the uniquness of rxp  among the other x - ray pulsars in binary systems with be companions .",
    "we used _ nuproducts _ , a part of the nustardas package , to extract source and background spectra and to generate  response matrix ( rmf ) and effective area ( arf ) files for a point source . in our analysis we utilized the most recent calibration database ( caldb ) , version 20150316 .",
    "the extracted spectra were then grouped to have more than 20 counts per bin using the _ grppha _ tool from the heasoft 6.15.1 package .",
    "we fit the  spectra using xspec version 12.8.1 @xcite .      according to measurements from the _ asca _ and _",
    "xmm - newton _ observatories , the spectrum of rxp  is characterized by a moderate absorption value @xmath60 @xmath61 , which is stable over a dozen years @xcite .",
    "this value was obtained by approximating the source spectra as a power law model modified by interstellar absorption ( wabs model in the xspec package ) .",
    "note that it is just slightly higher than the value of the interstellar hydrogen absorption @xmath62 @xmath61 determined by @xcite in the direction of rxp .    in the first three  observations rxp  serendipitously appeared highly offset from the optical axis , and at the large",
    "off - axis angles the absolute flux measurements can be affected by inaccurate psf positioning and subsequent inapropriate weighting in the spectrum extraction procedure .",
    "this leads to large systematics for the extracted spectra .",
    "therefore , we restrict detailed analysis of the source spectrum to the data obtained in the 4th ( on - axis ) observation , which provides high - quality data .    in general , the spectrum of rxp  has a shape which is typical for accreting pulsars in binary systems , showing a hard spectrum with an exponential cutoff at high energies .",
    "[ fig : spectr_onaxis ] ( a ) presents the phase - averaged spectrum approximated with the most suitable spectral model determined below .",
    "we initially modeled data with a cutoff power - law model ( cutoffpl in the xspec package ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the photon index , @xmath65 is the characteristic energy of the cutoff ( e.g. , the folding energy ) , and @xmath66 is a normalization .",
    "this model was modified by interstellar absorption in the form of the wabs model . as the working energy range of the _ nustar _ observatory begins at 3 kev ,",
    "it is not very sensitive to measuring low absorption columns . therefore , in the following analysis , the interstellar absorption was fixed to the value @xmath67 @xmath61 measured by @xcite .",
    "note that we simultaneously fitted spectra obtained by both _",
    "_ modules . to take into account the uncertainty in their relative calibrations , which may be even more of a concern for the observations where the source is highly offset from the optical axis",
    ", we added a cross - calibration constant between the modules .",
    "the fitting parameters for different data sets are shown in table  [ tab : spectr ] .",
    "the ` cutoff ' model approximates the source spectrum relatively well with @xmath68 for 921 degrees - of - freedom ( _ dof _ ; see table  [ tab : spectr ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a wave - like structure is clearly seen in the residual panel fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr_onaxis ] ( b ) . to improve the quality of the fit",
    ", we applied another continuum model in the form of a power - law multiplied by a high - energy cutoff ( highecut model in the xspec package ; @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : spectr_onaxis ] ( c ) , and best fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : spectr ] .",

    "the apparent discrepancy is probably due to the lower statistical quality of the _ integral _ data and the gap between the energy bands covered by the _ xmm - newton _ and _ integral _ observatories .",
    "an additional possible problem is that the cutoff energy @xmath74 kev is very close to the energy of the iron fluorescent line at 6.4 kev .",
    "the simplistic ` highecut ' model might hide the presence of the emission line in the source spectrum . observed deviations of the measured spectrum from the model near this energy argue in favor of this possibility .    to investigate this issue",
    ", we added a gaussian emission line to the ` highecut ' model , fixing its energy to 6.4 kev and width to @xmath75  kev , allowing its normalization to be a free parameter .",

    "the search procedure was performed following the prescription from @xcite .",

    "[ fig : pprof ] . the @xmath117  kev hardness ratio demonstrates correlation with the pulse intensity and the @xmath118  kev ratio peaks at the pulse minimum right in place where @xmath70 shifts from @xmath119 to @xmath120  kev . finally , it is necessary to note that the observed behavior of spectral parameters with the pulse phase can be caused by both physical and artificial reasons ( in particular , due to limitations of available data , the adopted spectral model , and which model parameters were fixed ) .",
    "more data are required to confidently constrain all the spectral parameters and trace their behavior with the pulse phase .",
    "we summarize the results of spectral and timing analysis of serendipitous and dedicated  observations of the accreting x - ray pulsar rxp  in 2014 may - june .    *",
    "the source demonstrates strong pulsations with a period of @xmath121  s. the @xmath3 pulsed fraction is measured to be constant with energy up to 40  kev . *",
    "the pulse profile is virtually independent of energy and can roughly be divided into one main peak at phases 0.00.5 and two smaller peaks at phases 0.50.75 and 0.751.0 .",
    "the only feature that is changing with energy is the depth of the main minimum at phase 0 . *",
    "the measured period shows a significant change over the @xmath122  day time span of the  observations , which is consistent with a spin - up rate of @xmath33  hz  s@xmath28 .",
    "this rate is in remarkable agreement with measurements made by @xcite almost a decade ago . * together with the results of @xcite , the _ xmm - newton _ data taken in 2007 and 2011 , and the  observations , we show a long - term spin - up trend of the source during the last 20 years . during the last 15 years",
    ", the source has undergone a strong and steady spin - up rate at the level of @xmath123 s s@xmath28 . *",
    "the power density spectrum of the source shows a clear break at 0.0066  hz , which is higher than the period frequency of 0.0015  hz .",
    "this fact , together with the steady persistent luminosity of the source , implies that the spin - up observed during the last 20  years is likely caused by a long - term mass accretion rate high enough to squeeze the magnetosphere inside the corotational radius , which makes rxp  unique among the other x - ray pulsars in binary systems with be companions .",
    "* the phase - averaged spectrum of the source has a typical shape for accreting neutron stars in binary systems , in particular , for x - ray pulsars , and demonstrates an exponential cutoff at high energies .",
    "our best - fit model contains an absorbed power - law with @xmath124 modified by a high - energy spectral drop with a cut - off energy of @xmath125  kev and a folding energy of @xmath126  kev .",
    "the spectrum also shows @xmath2 evidence for an iron 6.4  kev emission line , with an improvement in the fit when it is included . *",
    "the observed flux corresponds to an _ unabsorbed _ luminosity in the range @xmath127  , assuming a source distance between 4 and 7 kpc @xcite .",
    "these luminosity values imply that the source is a member of the subclass of persistent low luminosity be systems .",
    "* the phase - resolved spectroscopy shows some differences in source spectrum with phase .",
    "the cut - off energy is very stable over the pulse except at zero phase where its value increases by a factor of two .",
    "the apparent correlation of the folding energy with pulse intensity is attributed to the change in hardness of the source spectrum with orbital phase .",
