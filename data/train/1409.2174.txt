    "<S> lightest pseudoscalar ( @xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) exchange contribution to the light - by - light ( @xmath4 ) scattering piece of the muon anomaly , @xmath5 , has been evaluated using a resonance chiral lagrangian ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> best description of pion transition form - factor ( @xmath7 ) data is obtained with only tiny violations of one of the relations in the minimal consistent set of short - distance constraints on the anomalous @xmath6 couplings . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 @xmath7 , predicted in terms of the @xmath9 @xmath7 and the @xmath10 mixing , are in good agreement with measurements . with this input , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath11 , consistent with the reference determinations in the literature , albeit with smaller error .    electromagnetic form - factors , resonance chiral lagrangians , qcd , @xmath12 expansion , muon anomalous magnetic moment .    </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon , @xmath13 , is one the most precisely measured @xcite and accurately predicted @xcite observables . since 2000 </S>",
    "<S> , it exhibits a persistent discrepancy in the ballpark of three standard deviations , @xmath14 , @xmath15  @xcite . + as an electromagnetic property @xmath13 is , first , a stringent test of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the one loop contribution computed by schwinger @xcite fixes its size universally to @xmath17 for all charged leptons , which differs by six orders of magnitude with the current discrepancy @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> a tremendous effort in computing higher - order terms lead to the complete five - loop @xmath16 result @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its error is four orders of magnitude smaller than the previous value and the @xmath19 term is only @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this anomaly can not be attributed to uncalculated or imprecise @xmath16 contributions . </S>",
    "<S> + conversely , hadronic effects are important in @xmath13 : @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> hadronic vacuum polarization ( @xmath21 ) contributes @xmath22 to @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although with much smaller central value , the hadronic @xmath4 contribution ( @xmath23 ) is crucial for the final theoretical uncertainty : @xmath24 @xcite , if we stick to the most conservative estimate . </S>",
    "<S> + the total error on the standard model prediction for @xmath13 , @xmath25 , nearly equals the current experimental uncertainty , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> however , forthcoming experiments at fnal and j - parc @xcite will soon reduce the latter to a fourth . </S>",
    "<S> this urges theoreticians to achieve a similar error reduction to benefit fully from the precision of these measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this is our main motivation to revisit the dominant contribution to @xmath27 given by @xmath28 exchange . </S>",
    "<S> + we have reconsidered @xcite the lightest pseudoscalar ( @xmath0 @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) exchange contribution to @xmath27 , which is one of the possible intermediate states in the four - point @xmath29 green function with one real and three virtual photons that enters @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution turns out to basically saturate it , due to approximate cancellations between the remaining pieces @xcite . despite a simultaneous chiral and </S>",
    "<S> large-@xmath30 expansion has been suggested @xcite to tackle @xmath27 , the relative size of the various terms is not fully understood yet . </S>",
    "<S> this raises reasonable doubts on the errors obtained studying invividual contributions isolately , which might translate into an increased overall error for @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the main difficulty for computing @xmath27 has been that , contrary to the hadronic vacuum polarization , there was no way to relate it to measurements using dispersion relations and the optical theorem . </S>",
    "<S> however , very recently a formalism has been put forward @xcite , which would allow to extract the dominant one- and two - pion exchange contributions directly from data . </S>",
    "<S> + at the time being , nevertheless , the most precise experimental information that can be obtained on @xmath31 comes from the corresponding @xmath7 , where one photon is real to a very good approximation and the form - factor is measured as a function of the virtuality of the other photon up to roughly @xmath32 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that demanding an appropriate short - distance behaviour @xcite to the @xmath28 @xmath7 and to the related @xmath33 green s function turns out to be crucial for the reliability of the @xmath31 value . dedicated studies of this question @xcite have found that using @xmath6 @xcite ( rooted in the large-@xmath30 limit of qcd @xcite and chiral symmetry @xcite ) there exists a consistent set of short - distance constraints on the @xmath33 green function and related form factors @xcite . for this , the antisymmetric tensor formalism needs to be employed @xcite and pseudoscalar resonances be active degrees of freedom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still an open question whether all short - distance constraints are already imposed working this way , or there are new genuine relations arising from the @xmath29 green function which have not been considered yet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in this framework the @xmath9 @xmath7 can be written @xcite @xmath34 and one of the high - energy constraints in the minimal consistent set demands that @xmath35 cancels the @xmath36 term for @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that allowing a @xmath38 violation of this condition yields the best fit to current data .. ] fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : piggff ] compares our best fit result to all available data .     ]    </S>",
    "<S> the fully off - shell form factor is also needed to evaluate @xmath39 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it depends only on one additional coupling unrestricted by high - energy behaviour , which can be fixed analysing the @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays @xcite . upon the required integrations @xcite </S>",
    "<S> one finds    @xmath42    where the corresponding contributions to the error are discussed in detail in our paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + chiral dynamics and the @xmath2-@xmath43 mixing ( whose uncertainty saturates the error on @xmath44 ) allow to relate the @xmath9 @xmath7 to the @xmath45 @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are compared to data in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : etatff ] and [ fig : etaptff ] .     ]     ]    the corresponding contributions to @xmath39 being    @xmath46    @xmath47    our main result is the value @xmath48 for the contribution of the three lightest pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath43 ) to the muon anomaly , which is in good agreement with the two reference values : @xmath49 ( jegerlehner and nyffeler ) and @xmath50 ( prades , de rafael and vainshtein ) @xcite but has a reduced error , mainly thanks to the new babar and belle data on the @xmath28 @xmath7 extending to larger energies . </S>",
    "<S> + using the values in the literature for the remaining contributions to @xmath27 @xcite yields @xmath51 which would translate into a theoretical uncertainty on @xmath13 of @xmath52 , @xmath53 smaller than the current estimate . </S>",
    "<S> + finally , we also propose @xcite the measurement of @xmath54 and the corresponding differential distribution as a function of the di - muon invariant mass to better characterize the @xmath28 @xmath7 and hopefully further reduce the error of @xmath39 . </S>"
