    "turbulence may also appear in a system of nonlinearly interacting waves @xcite , which is referred to as _ wave turbulence_. the concept of wave turbulence originated from peierls work @xcite on anharmonic crystals .",

    "wave turbulence is much easier to understand than hydrodynamic turbulence , because it is appropriate when the building blocks of a system are linear waves that admit analytical descriptions .",
    "when the nonlinear interactions between waves may be treated as weak perturbations , the statistics of the system become tractable analytically .",
    "this allows one to derive the closed equation for the spectral energy density of the waves , called the _",
    "kinetic equation_. the kinetic equation for interacting waves has a steady - state scale invariant ( power - law ) solution that describes a constant flux of energy towards smaller scales .",
    "such a power law spectrum can be viewed as the wave analog of the kolmogorov spectrum of hydrodynamic turbulence  @xcite and is referred to as the _ kolmogorov - zakharov _ ( kz ) spectrum of wave turbulence @xcite .",
    "surface capillary waves are the ripples that are created by a light breeze on the surface of a pond .",
    "they are short waves for which surface tension is the primary restoring force .",
