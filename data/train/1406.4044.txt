    "theoretical models based on mean field interacting spin systems , although simplistic , are able to show a good qualitative description of cooperative macroscopic behavior in self - organizing systems . in the last decades , for this reason and their analytical tractability , they have also been applied to social sciences @xcite , finance @xcite , chemistry @xcite and ecology @xcite .",

    "for instance , the possibility of partitioning a population in classes of people sharing the same characteristics yields to a more realistic modeling . in this respect",
    ", it is worth to mention a series of papers @xcite , where this kind of interacting particle systems and techniques coming from statistical mechanics are used not only to describe problems concerning cultural coexistence , immigration and integration in societies , but also to make predictions at the population level .",
    "this framework has been tested against experimental data with an overall good agreement @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , the system under consideration consists of a two - population generalization of the classical mean field ising model .",
    "thus , on the complete graph two types of spins are present , with an interaction which is homogeneous among sites belonging to the same group , whereas it assumes a different value between sites of distinct populations . to have more intuition it may be helpful to think of the model as an interacting mixture of two curie - weiss models .",
    "+ in the equilibrium theory , the thermodynamic limit of the model has been rigorously obtained in @xcite , where also some preliminary results concerning the phase diagram are given . under mild assumptions on the interaction parameters and the restriction to populations of the same size , an analytic description of the latter is provided in @xcite .",
    "a variety of phase transitions is shown . + here , however , we examine in detail some aspects of the dynamics of the model .",
    "we start with a glauber dynamics for the @xmath0-particle system , where each spin may experience a flip with a rate depending on the gradient of the hamiltonian felt by the particle .",
    "next we show , via a large deviation approach on path space , that a propagation of chaos result holds and establish the asymptotic dynamics of the pair of group magnetizations in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this result corresponds to a law of large numbers and it allows to describe the macroscopic evolution of the system , which is deterministic .",
    "we then give the full phase diagram of the stationary solutions in absence of external fields .",
    "in comparison with the results in @xcite , we keep complete arbitrariness of the interaction parameters and , moreover , we relax the symmetry hypothesis on the relative proportion of the groups .",
    "although the model itself is not a novelty in literature and its static analysis is well understood , to our knowledge we provide the first attempt of dynamical description of the time evolution of such system , obtaining also some non - equilibrium properties . + the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sct : model - results ]",
