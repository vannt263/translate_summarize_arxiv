    "type ii supernovae ( sne ) emerge from shock - driven explosion of massive ( @xmath12 ) stars initiated by core collapse @xcite .",
    "in particular , plateau type ii sne ( sne iip ) result from core collapse of supergiants that have massive hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "the light curves of sne iip are characterized by a constant luminosity plateau lasting about 80 - 120 days after explosion @xcite .",
    "recently , the progenitors of a few sne iip have been directly identified on pre - explosion images @xcite , revealing that these are @xmath13 supergiants , close to the low - mass theoretical limit of the core collapse process .",
    "sn  2004dj in ngc  2403 is an outstanding sn discovered by itagaki @xcite on july 31 , 2004 ( jd 2453218 ) , because it is one of the brightest and closest supernova observed ever .",
    "based on its first optical spectrum @xcite sn  2004dj was quickly classified as a `` normal '' type iip event . unfortunately , it was discovered during the plateau phase ( @xmath14 month after explosion ) , thus , the maximum of the light curve could not be covered . due to its proximity ( @xmath15 mpc ) @xcite , sn  2004dj was also detected in radio @xcite , infrared @xcite and x - ray bands @xcite .",
    "@xmath16-band optical photometry and high - resolution @xmath17 spectroscopy obtained during the plateau phase was published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath18 light curve and full optical spectra in the nebular phase .",
    "they estimated the amount of @xmath19ni as @xmath20 , and pointed out an asymmetric , bipolar distribution of the ejected nickel from modeling the nebular @xmath17 profile .",
    "the optical light curve observed in the batc ( intermediate - band ) system was also studied by @xcite .",
    "they concluded that sn  2004dj was a typical sn iip that ejected a @xmath21 envelope and synthesized @xmath20 of radioactive nickel .",
    "particular interest was paid on the association of sn  2004dj with the compact cluster sandage  96 which is thought to be the host of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analysed the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sandage  96 ( based on archival ccd photometry ) , and concluded that s96 is indeed a compact cluster with age of @xmath22 myr and total stellar mass of @xmath23 ( the uncertainty is due to the different reddening determination ) . from population synthesis ,",
    "the initial mass of the progenitor star of sn  2004dj was estimated as @xmath24 , which is in the upper part of the mass range of other sne iip progenitors ( see above ) .    in this paper we present time - resolved optical photometry and spectroscopy of sn  2004dj covering its first year after discovery .",
    "our primary goal is to derive a reasonable distance to this sn and its host galaxy ngc  2403 by using all available information .",
    "the new observational data are presented in section 2 and 3 . in section 4",
    "we apply a variant of the expanding photosphere method ( epm ) and the sne iip standard candle method ( scm ) for distance determination , and critically compare the results with other distance estimates of the host galaxy .",
    "based on the improved distance , we estimate some of the physical properties of sn  2004dj and s96 in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 summarizes our results .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resulting parameters corresponding to the minimum of @xmath7 are listed in table  13 and plotted in fig .  19 .",
    "because the metallicity of ngc 2403 at the position of s96 is probably subsolar ( @xmath25o / h@xmath26 = -0.24 $ ] , @xcite ) , we have used the models with @xmath27 and @xmath28 metallicities from both grids . comparing these results with the published ones ( shown in the last three rows of table  13 ) , it is visible that our analysis resulted in the same kinds of solutions as the previous studies : a `` young '' population with @xmath8 myr and an `` old '' population with @xmath29 myr .",
    "the `` old '' solutions are very similar to the ones given in the previous studies .",
    "the `` young '' solution , however , has considerably less age .",
    "it is interesting that this solution comes out using both model grids , regardless of metallicity ( but with different reddenings and cluster masses , of course ) .",
    "based on the @xmath7 values , the `` young '' solution from the bc03 grid gives the best description of the observed data .",
    "however , we agree with @xcite that if the observed sed is undersampled , such as the one presented here , it may be misleading to accept or reject solutions based on @xmath7 values only .",
    "thus , we conclude that , at present , there are three probable solutions for the sed fitting of s96 : the old one corresponds to @xmath30 myr , the young one with @xmath31 myr , and a solution with age between these two , @xmath32 myr .",
    "each solutions have their own combinations of cluster reddening and total mass , between the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . due to the correlations between these parameters",
    ", it is not possible to assign a unique solution for all these quantities simultaneously .    regarding the potential progenitor of sn  2004dj ,",
    "it is seen in table  13 that the sn mass ( determined from the padova isochrones , @xcite ) ranges from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , depending on age .",
    "the uncertainty of the age determined from sed fitting is at least 10 % @xcite , implying an error of the sn - mass of about @xmath37 for the young- and @xmath38 for the old solution .",
    "it is interesting that the young ( 8 myr ) solution results in significantly higher mass than all the sne iip progenitor masses detected so far .",
    "the highest mass of a detected sn type ii progenitor is that of sn  1999ev @xcite with @xmath39 .",
    "this is similar to the progenitor mass of sn  2004et , being @xmath40 @xcite and sn  1999gi with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "contrary to these , the progenitors of sn  2003gd @xcite and sn  2005cs @xcite , also detected on pre - explosion images , are found within the mass range of @xmath42 .",
    "these two recent discoveries have led to a conclusion that perhaps all type iip sne emerge from relatively less massive progenitors , so that @xmath43 .",
    "this is supported by the non - detection of the progenitors of sn  1999em , sn  1999gi and sn  2001du @xcite giving @xmath44 .",
    "however , the possible masses of the progenitor of sn  2004dj determined above do not fully support this scenario . if the @xmath45 myr solution of s96 is indeed valid , then the progenitor mass of sn  2004dj must have been higher than @xmath46 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the masses found for the other progenitors , even for sn  1999ev ( see above ) .",
    "since the other two solutions for s96 give progenitor masses that are consistent with the mass range of the others , it can not be stated that sn  2004dj had definitely a more massive progenitor , but it can not be ruled out at present . in principle , the cluster masses in table  13 imply that there might be at least a few stars with @xmath11 when sn  2004dj exploded . from the integration of the salpeter imf , the number of stars with @xmath11 is @xmath47 , which gives @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the actual number of massive stars in s96 may , of course , differ from this value , but statistically it is possible that at least a few such stars are indeed there .",
    "@xcite estimated that s96 contains about 12 red and perhaps 2 - 3 blue supergiants , based on their sed parameters .",
    "the spectrophotometric observations of the remainder of s96 after the sn faded away would help to clarify the picture .",
    "comparing the observations of the co vibrational bands in the mid - ir with theoretical explosion models combined with radiative transfer calculations , @xcite presented evidence for a red supergiant with @xmath50 as the likely progenitor of sn  2004dj .",
    "again , this is at the upper end of the detected progenitor masses for type ii sne , close to the prediction of the @xmath51 myr cluster solution by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the parameters of the pre - supernova star using the formulae given by @xcite .",
    "these formulae relate the length of the plateau @xmath52 , the middle - plateau absolute magnitude @xmath53 and expansion velocity at the photosphere @xmath54 to the explosion energy ( @xmath55 ) , ejected mass ( @xmath56 ) and progenitor radius ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath57 days , @xmath58 mag and @xmath59 kms@xmath60 , and they got @xmath61 erg , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . from the more detailed analysis presented in this paper , we estimate these parameters as @xmath64 days ( sect .",
    "2.1.1 , allowing @xmath65 days for the peak duration before the plateau , see @xcite ) , @xmath66 mag and @xmath67 kms@xmath60 ( sect . 4.2 and 4.3 ) .",
    "these parameters result in @xmath68 erg , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is interesting that the ejected mass is , again , close to @xmath71 , although with high uncertainty .",
    "it is concluded that the presently available information suggest that the progenitor mass of sn  2004dj is @xmath72 .",
    "the sed fitting of s96 may suggest a cluster age as low as 8 myr , indicating @xmath73 .",
    "this massive progenitor may also be suspected from theoretical sn models .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * new @xmath0 photometric observations of sn  2004dj are presented .",
    "the date of explosion is estimated as june 30 , 2004 ( jd @xmath74 ) , about 1 month before discovery .",
    "the plateau phase lasted about @xmath75 days after explosion .",
    "the most probable value of the reddening toward sn  2004dj is @xmath76 mag @xcite .",
    "the progenitor cluster s96 is also detected on pre - explosion frames . *",
    "the new , plateau - phase optical spectra reveal great similarity between sn  2004dj and sn  1999em , a typical sn iip .",
    "radial velocities from metallic lines and @xmath77 are presented .",
    "the spectral features are successfully modeled with the spectrum synthesis code _ synow _ with @xmath78 k as the photospheric temperature .",
    "the observed p cyg profile of @xmath77 can be better described by an increased emission of the photosphere relative to the blackbody intensity at the rest wavelength of @xmath77 .",
    "a single nebular spectrum confirms the @xmath77 asymmetry reported by @xcite . *",
    "the distance to sn  2004dj is estimated from two methods applicable for sne iip .",
    "the epm distance is @xmath79 mpc , while the scm gives @xmath80 mpc .",
    "these are in good agreement with other distance estimates to the host galaxy ngc  2403 , based on cepheids and tf - relation , although the cepheid - distance is slightly less than the sn - distances .",
    "the averaged distance is @xmath81 mpc , which is consistent with all available information . *",
    "using the updated distance , the nickel mass of sn  2004dj is calculated as @xmath82 from the shape of the tail light curve .",
    "the progenitor mass has been estimated from fitting theoretical seds to the observations of s96 .",
    "the solutions are similar to those of @xcite and @xcite , except that a `` young '' solution corresponding to @xmath8 myr is also possible .",
    "such a young cluster age would mean that the mass of the progenitor was @xmath11 .",
    "the sn - masses of the other solutions are less than @xmath83 , being in better agreement with other sne iip progenitors .",
