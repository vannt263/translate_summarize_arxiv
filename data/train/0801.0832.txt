    "quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) are the most luminous active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes ( bh ) .",
    "the growing observational evidence that massive bhs exist not only in the centers of active galaxies , but also in inactive early - type galaxies indicates that more than the mere presence of a massive bh is needed to trigger the activity . and while the `` bright quasar phase '' is now often cited as an essential phase in the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we still do not have a clear picture of what causes the triggering , or even what the necessary conditions are for the triggering to occur .    for more than two decades",
    "now , mergers have been suspected to be responsible for triggering qsos @xcite .",
    "there is an abundance of circumstantial evidence in the literature connecting qso activity at low redshifts with mergers and interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "not only do a number of low - redshift qsos show signs of interactions and mergers , but there is also a tendency for qso host galaxies to exist in only moderately rich environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see , however , @xcite for a counterexample ) consistent with the results of quasar clustering studies , which suggests that quasars exist in haloes of mass @xmath110@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite . in such environments ,",
    "velocity dispersions are moderate , and interactions have their greatest effect .    at least in the case of qsos found in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ,",
    "there is a close connection between mergers and qso activity .",
    "ulirgs are essentially always found in merging systems @xcite , and far too many of them harbor qsos to be explained by the joint probability of finding a given @xmath7 or brighter galaxy to be both a ulirg and a qso host galaxy by chance @xcite .",
    "so , at least for this subclass of qso , some of the gas that the merger feeds into the central starburst also finds its way much deeper to the central black hole .",
    "nevertheless , recent high - resolution imaging studies show that a large fraction of qsos reside in hosts with relaxed morphologies like elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations have elicited claims that tidal interactions in qso host galaxies are the exception rather than the rule , and that even in those cases in which there are clear signs of interaction , the interactions are not necessarily related to the nuclear activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * hereafter d03 ) . from two - dimensional fitting of a well matched sample of 33 agns ( radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos as well as radio galaxies ) ,",
    "using images obtained with the wide field & planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board _ hst _ , d03 concluded that `` for nuclear luminosities @xmath8 , the hosts of both radio - loud _ and _ radio - quiet agn are virtually all massive elliptical galaxies with basic properties that are indistinguishable from those of quiescent , evolved , low - redshift ellipticals of comparable mass '' .",
    "such conclusions conflict with recent findings of significant amounts of dust and cold molecular gas , as well as young stellar populations , in many radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although the hosts of most luminous agns are bulge - dominated , they seem to be significantly bluer than inactive elliptical galaxies and indeed show evidence for starbursts in the relatively recent past ( 12 gyr ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , both numerical simulations and observations show that merger remnants that have undergone violent relaxation have surface - brightness profiles that follow @xmath9 laws ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even while still showing clear signs of the tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "thus , if qso host galaxies are indeed relatively recent merger remnants , they would most likely have elliptical profiles , but they would also show fine structure indicative of past interactions .    detecting fine structure in the already elusive qso host galaxies",
    "is a challenging task .",
    "studies of nearby merger remnants show that their fine structure is often faint compared to the galaxies themselves .",
    "for example , the total luminosity of the shells in shell galaxies accounts only for 515% of the total luminosity of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their detection often requires a resolution of at least @xmath10.5 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , detecting fine structure in qso hosts requires high angular resolution and higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) observations than those obtained in previous studies .",
    "thus , we are conducting a study with deep ( 5 orbit ) hst acs and wfpc2 observations of a sample of qso host galaxies that are classified as ellipticals .",
    "we presented results for the first object in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in the present paper , we describe results for the four remaining objects from our pilot acs study of 5 objects .",
    "we will present results for the rest of the sample ( 14 additional objects ) in subsequent papers . throughout this paper , we adopt @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 = 71 kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 .",
    "since the goal of our project is to investigate the possibility that qso host galaxies are formed through mergers even when they do not show dramatic signs of tidal interactions , we should ideally draw our sample from a sample of hosts that have been classified as undisturbed elliptical galaxies .",
    "the best such sample is that of d03 .    from the detailed morphological study of radio - loud and radio - quiet qso host galaxies by d03 , we selected qsos for which the host galaxies were classified as elliptical galaxies .",
    "moreover , we selected those objects for which existing deep keck spectra did not reveal extended emission lines that could contaminate our observations in the broad @xmath0-band filter ( f606w ) .",
    "we chose a sample of five qsos , three radio - quiet and two radio - loud .",
    "the sample properties are summarized in table  [ obstable ] .",
    "all observations were obtained using the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) onboard the _ hst _ with the broad @xmath0-band f606w filter ( @xmath14 = 2342 ; 1 pixel corresponds to 0.05 ) .",
    "five sets of dithered images were taken ( with four subsets of 485588 s integration time each ) , yielding a total integration time of 1074011464 s per target ( see table  [ obstable ] ) .",

    "consequently , the central pixels of the qso nuclei are saturated in these images .",
    "we discuss the effects of the saturation in detail in the next section .",
    "we re - calibrated the data manually , correcting the pipeline flat - fielded single exposures for the bias - level offset between the adjacent quadrants that is still present in the final product of calacs @xcite .",
    "we used multidrizzle @xcite to combine the individual images to the final distortion and cosmic - ray corrected scientific image ( default values plus bits=8578 and a deltashift file with the offsets between the images as determined from stars within the field - of - view ( fov ) ) .",
    "note that no sky subtraction was performed during multidrizzle .",
    "different methods such as unsharp masking , creating a structure map @xcite , and using the two - dimensional galaxy fitting program galfit @xcite were applied to look for any fine structure that might be present .",
    "we here describe only the procedure we adopted for the use of galfit as the other two methods did not yield additional information ( see paper i for details on these methods ) .    for convolution with the point - spread function ( psf ) of the _ hst _ acs optics , we created both an artificial psf star from tinytim ( version 6.3 ) at the same position as each qso and a psf star from an observed star on an acs / wfc f606w image observed close to the positions of the qsos . for the tinytim psf",
    ", we adopted a power law @xmath15 with @xmath16 = @xmath170.3 which is the average value we obtain for the qsos .",
    "ranges between 0.1 and 0.7 as measured from nuclear keck spectra . ]",
    "the computed radius for this artificial psf is 10 .    for the observed psf star , we chose a star with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of 20,000 from the _ hst _ archive . the star was observed on 20 dithered images with a total exposure time of @xmath18100s ( go-9433 , data sets j6mf19 * and j6mf21 * ) and at a position of the wfc chip less than 5@xmath18 away from the position of each qso ; note that the full acs fov is 3.4  @xmath19 3.4 .",
    "these images were processed in the same manner as described above for the qso observations .",
    "finally , we eliminated a few faint objects surrounding the psf star and modified the psf image to minimize any noise introduced during psf subtraction and convolution procedures . to adaptively smooth the psf , we compared data values to the standard deviation @xmath20 of the surrounding sky : ( 1 ) for data values @xmath21 7@xmath20 , we retained the unmodified psf ; ( 2 ) for data values between 3@xmath20 and 7@xmath20 ,",
    "the image was smoothed with a gaussian kernel with @xmath22 = 0.5 pixel ; ( 3 ) for data values @xmath23 , a gaussian kernel of @xmath22 = 2.0 pixel was used , and ( 4 ) for data values @xmath24 after this last operation , the value was replaced with 0 .",
    "the radius of the observed psf star is @xmath14 .",
    "the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the psf is 0.1  in both the artificial star and the observed psf star , in close agreement with the fwhm of stars on the acs images close to the qso .",
    "the observed psf star has @xmath25 @xmath26 1.4 mag , as inferred from usno data .",
    "to test chromatic effects on the form of the psf , we created a series of artificial psf stars using tinytim .",
    "we used power laws with @xmath16 ranging from -4.0 to 0.9 , corresponding to @xmath25 values between 2 mag and 0 mag ( to account for the observed range of @xmath25 of the qsos and the star , plus possible uncertainties ) .",
    "we also created psfs using a blackbody spectrum with temperatures between 3000 and 40000 k. we fitted these different psfs and a host galaxy model to our qsos .",
    "the derived host galaxy parameters vary by 2% .",
    "we thus consider the chromatic effects as negligible compared to the other uncertainties such as the psf mismatch due to telescope or plate scale breathing , focus changes , psf saturation ( see below ) etc .",
    "we subtracted the two different psfs ( star and tinytim ) from saturated and unsaturated stars within the acs fov , for comparison .",
    "the observed psf star yielded significantly better results than the tinytim psf .",
    "thus , we used the observed psf star for all the subsequent fitting and , in the following , we simply refer to it as psf or psf star .",
    "this exercise also allowed us to estimate the quality of our psf fit , taking into account the saturation of the qso nucleus .",
    "the central region within a radius of @xmath11.7  is strongly affected by the psf subtraction .",
    "any structure within this region may be an artifact .",
    "we created artificial images to test the influence of the psf saturation on the derived qso host galaxy parameters .",
    "since luminous quasars generally do not vary much over time scales of a few years , we can compare our quasar luminosities with d03 to estimate the degree of saturation in our images and the potential systematic errors that might arise due to saturation .",
    "this direct comparison shows that our agns may be saturated by as much as 60% .",
    "( note that we define `` 60% saturation '' in such a way that 60% of the flux is lost due to saturation . ) in addition , we created model images where the agn has the same luminosity as in d03 .",
    "we then saturated the agn by 60% . after masking out the central saturated pixels in the same manner as we analyzed our data ( see below ) , we find that our systematic errors can be as large as 7% for the magnitude , 30% for the effective radius of the different host galaxy components and up to 30% for the srsi index",
    ". the psf magnitude can be underestimated by up to 90% due to saturation .",
    "this explains the differences in agn luminosity that we observe compared with d03 ( see table  [ results ] ) .",
    "galfit @xcite is a 2-dimensional fitting program based on @xmath27@xmath28 minimization ; it allows the user to simultaneously fit one or more objects in an image with different model light distributions , such as srsi @xcite , de vaucouleurs @xcite , or exponential .",
    "the following steps were performed .",
    "we created a mask to exclude the saturated pixels in the center , the diffraction spikes , surrounding objects , and any visible fine structure in order to fit only the smooth underlying host galaxy light distribution .",
    "for the purpose of the @xmath27@xmath28 minimization , pixels were weighted by 1/@xmath22@xmath28 with @xmath22 based on poisson statistics as estimated by galfit .",
    "( note that the weighting is however irrelevant for the central saturated pixel that were masked . ) a psf and a srsi function were fitted .",
    "we fitted the background sky and bright close neighboring galaxies simultaneously , while faint neighboring objects were simply masked .",
    "this least - square fit was then subtracted from the original image to obtain the residual image in which any fine structure superposed on the smooth host galaxy light distribution is more readily visible .    to estimate the uncertainties caused by the sky determination ,",
    "we used two different approaches . first , different sizes of the fitting region were used ( up to the largest possible size ) with the sky varying freely .",
    "second , the sky was also determined independently and held fixed to this value during alternative fits .",
    "note that a srsi power law is defined as @xmath29 \\hspace{0.2 cm } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the pixel surface brightness at the effective radius @xmath3 , and @xmath31 is the srsi index ( @xmath32 for a de vaucouleurs profile , @xmath33 for an exponential profile ) .",
    "to fit the host galaxies , we used three different models : ( 1 ) a single de vaucouleurs profile ( srsi with @xmath32 ) , ( 2 ) a single srsi profile ( @xmath31 free ) and ( 3 ) a combination of a de vaucouleurs plus exponential ( srsi with @xmath33 ) profile . if the sky value is kept fixed during the fitting process , the fit for ( 1 ) has a total of nine free parameters : three parameters for the fitting of the psf ( @xmath16 , @xmath34 , magnitude ) , and six free parameters for the fitting of the de vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath16 , @xmath34 , magnitude , @xmath3 , b / a , p.a . ) .",
    "model ( 2 ) has one additional free parameter for the index @xmath31 .",
    "model ( 3 ) has six more free parameters than model ( 1 ) .",
    "these parameters correspond to the exponential profile ( @xmath16 , @xmath34 , magnitude , @xmath3 , b / a , p.a . ) . in all three cases , if the sky is also fitted , there are three additional parameters ( background and gradient in @xmath16 and @xmath34 ) . in some cases , we used a srsi profile to fit bright galaxies in close proximity to the qso hosts ( phl909 : six galaxies ; pg0923 + 201 : seven galaxies , mc21635 + 119 : one galaxy ) . in those cases , the free parameters for these fits",
    "add to the number of total free parameters .",
    "in this section , we summarize the results for all five qsos in the pilot sample .",
    "although mc21635 + 119 was discussed in detail in paper i , figure  [ finalsbp ] shows its luminosity profile which was not included in paper i. to facilitate comparisons , we also include the results for mc21635 + 119 in the tables .      figure  [ final ] shows the acs / wfc images for four of the five qsos in our sample : phl909 , pks0736 + 01 , pg0923 + 201 , and ox169 .",
    "including mc21635 + 119 , four of the five host galaxies reveal extended fine structure on different scales and with different morphologies , ranging from spectacular shells and arcs ( mc21635 + 119 ; paper i ) , to tidal tails ( phl909 ) to jet - like ( ox169 ) and spiral - like ( pks0736 + 01 ) structure .",
    "only one object ( pg0923 + 201 ) resides in a host galaxy without any obvious fine structure .",
    "we here describe the overall host - galaxy morphology for each object in turn .",
    "further details on each object , including a comparison with results in the literature and a description of neighboring objects , are given in appendix  [ individual ] .",
    "the host galaxy of phl909 shows a variety of fine structures at different radii .",
    "a central ring- or disk - like structure ( @xmath351.8   2.5 ) can be seen , possibly intersected by a dust lane to the se ( fig .",
    "[ final ] ) . to the nw ,",
    "two shells are apparent .",
    "they occur at distances of 2.5  ( p.a .",

    "diffuse outer material seems to form another ring or disk - like structure ( fig .",
    "[ acs ] , inset ; @xmath35 3.4   6 ) .",
    "the most prominent fine structure consists of two tidal tails , one extending from the disk - like structure in the se , curving towards the n , and the other extending from the disk in the nw , bending towards the south ( figs .",
    "[ final ] and  [ acs ] ) .",
    "the western tidal tail extends to a galaxy ( `` a '' ; fig .",
    "[ acs ] ) @xmath2616  to the nw ( p.a .",
    "@xmath26 284@xmath36 ) .",
    "the tidal feature most likely corresponds to the faint extended emission reported by @xcite which was also seen in the k - band image @xcite .",
    "the companion ( `` a '' ) itself has two tidal tails , one reaching out in the direction of the qso and connecting with its tidal tail , another tidal tail extending to the s up to 5.5  ( fig .",
    "[ final ] ) .",
    "also the eastern tidal tail seems to be connected to a very faint small companion ( `` d '' ) at 14  distance from the qso ( p.a .",
    "@xmath26 98@xmath36 ) , possibly a dwarf galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ acs ] , inset ) .",
    "pks0736 + 01 has been observed in the near - infrared k - band by @xcite .",
    "the host is about 10  in diameter and is described as highly disturbed with a large area of low surface - brightness nebulosity and several compact companions embedded . in our deep _",
    "acs image , this nebulosity is clearly visible and shows resolved structure that looks like a faint face - on spiral .",
    "the spiral - like structure extends out to a radius of 16  ( @xmath26 50kpc ) , i.e.  very large for a normal spiral galaxy .",
    "also , the pitch angle changes with radius , arguing against a simple spiral - arm interpretation . instead , what is observed here , may be spatial wrapping of material from a merger event ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ mergerage ] ) .",
    "pg0923 + 201 resides in a galaxy group of at least 6 galaxies , some of which form closely interacting pairs , including the two large elliptical galaxies to the south - east of the qso ( see appendix  [ individual ] ) .",
    "however , the host galaxy itself does not reveal any obvious fine structure in the deep _ hst _ acs image .",
    "the host galaxy of mc21635 + 119 has been described in detail in paper i. it reveals spectacular fine structure , consisting of ( at least ) five interleaved inner shells ( out to @xmath35 13kpc ) and several extended arcs out to a radius of @xmath1 65kpc .    the host galaxy of ox169 exhibits an extended linear structure which has been reported by several authors @xcite .",
    "ox169 was studied by @xcite and @xcite who described this jet - like structure in detail .",
    "@xcite showed that it consists mainly of old stars at the same redshift .",
    "this is supported by the prominence of the structure also in the k - band image @xcite .",
    "while the feature resembles a galactic disk seen edge - on , with a dust lane in the se , it is not centered on the qso ; almost 2/3 of it lies on the se side of the qso .",
    "because of its strong asymmetry , @xcite favor an interpretation as a tidal tail seen edge - on rather than a normal galactic disk . in our deep _",
    "acs image , the linear structure is very prominent and extends over a projected distance of @xmath168kpc .",
    "the feature runs from nw to se ( p.a .",
    "@xmath26 303@xmath36 ) , out to @xmath267.6  in the nw and @xmath2612.5  in the se .",
    "it is slightly curved and appears to continue across the nucleus .",
    "a dust lane is clearly visible between 7.6  and 11.5  in the se side of the tail .",
    "in addition to the prominent linear structure , the deep _ hst _ acs image reveals faint extended structure for the first time : a shell - like feature in the ne ( p.a .",
    "@xmath26 83@xmath36 ) at a distance of @xmath265 , plumes to the n of the se end of the tail ( p.a .",
    "@xmath26 110@xmath36 ) at a distance of @xmath2611.5  from the center , and a fan extending from the se tail towards the sw .",
    "the latter extends out to a companion ( `` a '' ; fig .",
    "[ acs ] ) to the sw ( p.a .",
    "@xmath26 235@xmath36 ) at a distance of 6.1  and may be a tidal stream .",
    "the companion has an overall spiral - like morphology which seems to be tidally stretched .",
    "these findings provide strong support for the interpretation of the linear structure as a tidal tail seen edge on rather than it being a normal galactic disk .",
    "it is only natural to assume that all features have a common origin during a merger event .      as described in section  [ process ] , we modeled the qso host galaxies with galfit and fitted single de vaucouleurs profiles , single srsi components , and a combination of de vaucouleurs and exponential - disk profiles .",
    "varying the range of the sky parameter shows that the uncertainty in photometry can be up to 20% , the uncertainty in @xmath3 up to 10% , and the uncertainty in srsi index up to 20% .",
    "these uncertainties add to the uncertainties from the psf saturation ( see sec .",
    "[ process ] ) .",
    "the total uncertainties are @xmath120% for photometry , @xmath130% in @xmath3 and @xmath135% in the srsi index .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ results ] .",
    "for all objects , good fits were achieved with all three fitting functions mentioned above .",
    "the fits improved slightly in going from a single de vaucouleurs to a single srsi to a combination of de vaucouleurs plus exponential - disk profiles ( see table  [ results ] ) .",
    "while this is expected simply because of the increasing number of free parameters , the residual images do look smoother for the two - component fits .",
    "in such a decomposition , the de vaucouleurs profile remains the dominant component , but the exponential - disk component contributes between 6% and 28% of the total luminosity in @xmath0 of the hosts ( table  [ results ] ) .",
    "the residual image did improve significantly when adding a second component to the host in mc21635 + 119 ( paper i ) .",
    "single - srsi fits yielded a srsi index around 4 for each of the host galaxies ( ranging between 2.9 and 6.5 ) .",
    "our results for the surface - brightness profiles of the underlying host galaxies are thus in overall agreement with those of @xcite . in figure",
    "[ finalall ] , we show the residual images derived by subtracting a galfit model consisting of a single srsi profile from the observed images .",
    "we derived surface - brightness profiles for each object using the iraf task _",
    "ellipse_. the profiles were obtained for both the observed surface brightness and the best - fitting model using galfit and its subcomponents .",
    "the resulting 1d profiles for the different fits ( single de vaucouleurs , single srsi , de vaucouleurs plus exponential ) are only marginally different .",
    "therefore , we only present the best fitting model using a srsi component in figure  [ finalsbp ] .",
    "the deviation of the model from the data within the central 1.7  is most likely caused by the psf subtraction .",
    "this is especially pronounced for pg0923 + 201 , as this object has the brightest psf ( see table  [ results ] ) , and the low s / n ratio in the outer parts of the psf star results in additional noise in the data . in general , data points at a higher surface brightness than the model correspond to the fine structure that was masked out during galfit fitting but that was included for the creation of the 1d profiles .",
    "this is clearly the case for ox169 , for which the tidal tail causes the deviation between data and model beyond 5 .",
    "the surface - brightness plot of the observed host profile of pg0923 + 201 shows a bump peaking around 2  that is not fitted by the model .",
    "since this feature lies just outside of the central region that is affected by the psf , we found it difficult to determine whether it is real or not .",
    "however , it could reflect the presence of an inner disk .",
    "if so , the outer radius of this disk would be approximately 8kpc .",
    "the outer `` uplift '' of points over the best - fit profile ( around @xmath37 ) is most likely due to the companion galaxy to the sse and the relatively strong residuals that remain after subtracting the galfit model for this galaxy ( see also fig .  [ finalall ] ) .",

    "much of the fine structure observed in our deep _ hst _",
    "acs images of the other four qso host galaxies is indicative of merger events in the relatively recent past .",
    "the possible type and timescales for the merger in mc21635 + 119 were discussed in detail in paper i. briefly , we found that the fine structure seen in the host galaxy of this object was most likely produced by a strong tidal interaction within the last @xmath11gyr . on the one hand , the regularity of the inner shell structure is suggestive of a near radial collision of a dwarf galaxy with a giant elliptical galaxy in a minor merger . on the other hand ,",
    "the arcs observed at much larger distances than the inner shells , and other tidal debris off - axis from the direction of the encounter implied by the inner shells , are more indicative of a major merger . using simple @xmath43-body simulations , we estimated that the time scale needed to form the observed structure is less than @xmath11.7 gyr ( see paper i for details ) . in comparison ,",
    "the spectrum of the host galaxy is dominated by a population of intermediate - age ( @xmath11.4 gyr ) stars , indicative of a strong starburst that may have occurred during the merger event .",
    "thus , the observed qso activity may have been triggered in the recent past either by a minor merger or by debris from an older ( @xmath1gyr ) major merger that is currently `` raining '' back into the central regions of the merger remnant .",
    "the prominent extended structure observed in ox169 is most likely a tidal tail seen edge on .",
    "prominent tidal tails are also observed in the host of phl909 .",
    "the tails in both qso hosts are strongly suggestive of relatively recent major merger events , where at least some of the parent galaxies were disk galaxies .",
    "the structure surrounding pks0736 + 201 resembles that of the seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc5548 , an sa galaxy with ripples , tidal arms and a faint long tidal tail that has been described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the observed structure in ngc5548 has been interpreted in terms of the spatial wrapping of material from an obliquely infalling companion . when seen in projection",
    ", such material can appear in the form of relatively sharp - edged ripples @xcite .",
    "compared with ngc5548 , the faint spiral - like structure seen in pks0736 + 01 is more extended ( @xmath1 50kpc vs. 10kpc ) and more regular .    structure similar to that observed in pks 0736 + 201 can be reproduced in numerical simulations of minor mergers . for example , the merger of a dwarf elliptical galaxy with a large spiral and a total mass ratio of 1:8 results in very similar structure @xmath11gyr after the first passage of the two galaxies , but also again at later stages in the merger event ( @xcite ; t. j. cox , private communication ) .    by comparing the structure observed in these hosts to results from numerous published @xmath43-body simulations of mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "we know that the ages of these tidal features are likely of the order of a few orbital times . given the masses of giant elliptical galaxies and the distances at which we observe these features , this time span ranges from a few hundred myr to about 1 gyr . in the cases in which we can clearly see tidal tails , we can infer that the dynamical timescales can not be much less than @xmath44 myr , since that is roughly the amount of time that it would take for stars with typical orbital velocities ( @xmath45kms@xmath13 ) to travel in a straight line to the projected maximum distances at which we observe the features ( e.g. , @xmath1 50 kpc for phl909 or @xmath1 42 kpc for ox169 ) . on timescales longer than @xmath11 gyr , tidal tails are expected to rapidly disperse and lose contrast .",
    "further evidence that these are relatively evolved mergers is the fact that enough time has elapsed since the initial tidal encounter for each host to acquire an essentially elliptical morphology .",
    "while it is possible that some of the objects , such as mc1635 + 119 and pg0923 + 201 , may have started off as elliptical galaxies , at least ox169 and phl909 must have resulted from the merger of disk galaxies .",
    "the fact that they are at the present time reasonably well fitted by de vaucouleurs profiles implies merger timescales on the order of a gyr .    to address the question of whether the agn activity may indeed have been triggered by the merger events , we need to obtain estimates of the different timescales involved .",
    "how do the ages of the stellar populations compare to the time elapsed since the merger events , and what does that imply for the qso duty cycle ?",
    "what is the connection between merger , star formation , and bh accretion ?    as mentioned above , the timescales for the merger events observed in our sample is of the order of a gyr or less .",
    "g. canalizo & a. stockton ( 2008 , in preparation ) find similar timescales for strong starburst events in the host galaxies of these qsos . by modeling deep keck spectra of these objects",
    ", they find traces of major starburst episodes in intermediate - age starburst populations that involve a substantial fraction of the stellar mass .",
    "these starburst ages range from @xmath46 gyr ( ox169 ) to 2.2 gyr ( pks0736 + 017 ) .",
    "hence , it seems possible that the starbursts were triggered by the merger events .",
    "the most difficult timescale to estimate is that of the duration of the agn activity .",
    "current estimates of qso lifetimes range between 10@xmath47 and 10@xmath48 years and are derived primarily from demographics ( see review by @xcite ) . for example , from theoretical calculations @xcite estimate a mean lifetime for a luminous qso ( @xmath49 @xmath50 10@xmath51ergs@xmath13 ) of ( 313 ) @xmath19 10@xmath52 yr which is comparable to the salpeter time scale ( @xmath1 4.5 @xmath19 10@xmath52 yr for @xmath53 = 0.1 and @xmath54 = 1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "apart from demographics , there have been several attempts to deduce the agn duty cycle for individual galaxies .",
    "for example , the length of radio jets can yield a lower estimate of qso lifetimes , depending on the expansion speed of the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this method can not be applied to our sample as the two radio - loud qsos in the sample each feature only a compact flat - spectrum radio source .",
    "also , the size of the nlr has been proposed as a straightforward geometric measure of agn lifetimes @xcite .",
    "however , the nlr sizes for the five qsos of our sample have not yet been determined .",
    "thus , as we do not have a direct way to estimate the time elapsed since the triggering of the nuclear activity for the objects in our sample , it is difficult to work out the physical relationship between the mergers we detect and the fueling of the qsos .",
    "an overly simplistic scenario , in which each qso was triggered by the merger at the time of the starburst episode would imply qso lifetimes on the order of a gyr , in stark contrast to the theoretical estimates cited above . instead , our observations may provide evidence in support of significant time delays between tidal interactions and the fueling of the central black holes , as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , while qsos often reside in bulge - dominated galaxies like the ones presented in this study , they are also frequently found in young mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if , as the accumulating evidence suggests , mergers are indeed essential for the triggering of qsos , then our results imply at least one of two scenarios : either qso activity is episodic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and occurs over longer timescales than previously speculated , or there is a large range of values for the time delays between the merger and the onset of the nuclear activity .",

    "<S> we present results from a pilot _ hst _ acs deep imaging study in broad - band @xmath0 of five low - redshift qso host galaxies classified in the literature as ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of our study is to determine whether these early - type hosts formed at high redshift and have since evolved passively , or whether they have undergone relatively recent mergers that may be related to the triggering of the nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> we perform two - dimensional modeling of the light distributions to analyze the host galaxies morphology . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , while each host galaxy is reasonably well fitted by a de vaucouleurs profile , the majority of them ( 4/5 ) reveal significant fine structure such as shells and tidal tails . </S>",
    "<S> these structures contribute between @xmath15% and 10% to the total @xmath0-band luminosity of each host galaxy within a region of @xmath2 3@xmath3 and are indicative of merger events that occurred between a few hundred myr and a gyr ago . </S>",
    "<S> these timescales are comparable to starburst ages in the qso hosts previously inferred from keck spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus support a consistent scenario in which most of the qso host galaxies suffered mergers with accompanying starbursts that likely also triggered the qso activity in some way , but we are also left with considerable uncertainty on physical mechanisms that might have delayed this triggering for several hundred myr after the merger . </S>"
