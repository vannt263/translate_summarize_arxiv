    "since the discovery of the quantum hall effect , quantum transport property of two - dimensional(2d ) systems in strong magnetic fields has been one of the central issues of the condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of electrons in two dimensions in a strong magnetic field forms equally spaced degenerate energy levels called the landau levels . in the presence of boundaries , there exist the edge states extending along the boundary of the sample @xcite .",
    "the edge state corresponds to the classical skipping orbit along the boundary and is known to be less influenced by impurities and defects of the system @xcite .",
    "since the edge state is associated with each landau level , the number of edge states at the fermi energy is equal to the number of the landau levels below it .",
    "the conductance is therefore quantized to be @xmath0 per spin when the fermi energy lies between the @xmath1th and the @xmath2th landau levels . in the absence of impurity scattering ,",
    "the transition between quantized values of the conductance occurs when the fermi energy crosses the landau level .",
    "the stability of the edge states and the mixing of the edge and the bulk states in the presence of impurities has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that even in the presence of disorder , the edge state is well defined and is extended along the boundary as long as its energy lies away from those of the bulk landau subbands and the magnetic field is strong enough .",
    "on the other hand , when its energy lies in the middle of the bulk landau subbands , the edge state mixes with the bulk states by the impurity scattering , which leads to the localization of edge states @xcite .",
    "it has been shown for long quantum hall wires with uncorrelated disorder potential that the conductance indeed vanishes when the fermi energy is close to the centers of the bulk landau subbands @xcite .",
    "the zero conductance regime therefore appears between the conductance plateaus @xmath0 and @xmath3 in the presence of disorder ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this transition between the quantized conductance and the insulator is called the chiral metal - insulator transition ( cmit ) @xcite .     and",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath4 per plaquette is assumed to be @xmath5 .",
    "the site energies @xmath6 obey the gaussian distribution with variance @xmath7 in units of the hopping amplitude .",
    "the spatial correlation of site energies is assumed to be @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the distance between the sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "conductance with potential correlation ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) and that without it ( @xmath14 @xmath15 are plotted . for @xmath12 , @xmath16",
    "is shown instead of @xmath17 . here",
    "the lattice constant is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines represent the positions of the conductance steps in the absence of disorder , namely the positions of the bulk landau levels.@xcite [ fig1 ] ]    we focus on the effect of disorder correlation in such systems . for the bulk quantum hall system",
    ", the effect of potential correlation has been studied @xcite and demonstrated numerically that the potential correlation suppresses the mixing between edge states @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that the critical energies of the bulk system are insensitive to the potential correlation as long as the disorder is weak@xcite .",
    "all these results are consistent with the intuitive picture that the potential correlation makes the potential smooth and reduces the scattering with large momentum transfers .",
    "it is therefore expected naively that in the case of the quantum hall wires , the zero conductance regime observed for the uncorrelated potential is suppressed and the quantized conductance steps are recovered when the potential correlation is introduced . in the previous paper@xcite , we have found indeed the suppression of cmit which yields the recovery of the quantized conductance steps .",
    "quite unexpectedly , however , it has also been found that the quantized conductance steps shift toward higher energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is remarkable since this means that the potential correlation acts against the conduction of the system contrary to the naive expectation .",
    "we have found that the scale of the shift is of the order of the strength of random potential and is insensitive to the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the shift appears in wires but does not appear in short systems . for understanding the physics behind this shift , we have argued that the correlated potential can act as a potential barrier across the wire , which produces the same amount of shift for each plateau transition .",
    "it has also been found @xcite by calculating the conductance for various values of energies keeping the disorder potential fixed , that though the size of the shifts depends considerably on the sample , the distance between successive transitions , namely the plateau width , is insensitive to the sample and is essentially the same as the bulk landau level separation .",
    "the quantum hall wire is therefore an interesting system where the potential correlation affects qualitatively its transport property .    in the present paper ,",
    "we further examine the effect of the disorder correlation in quantum hall wires by considering a different type of disorder , namely the disordered magnetic fields . when the disordered component of the magnetic fields is smaller than its uniform component , the system belongs to the quantum hall universality class except for the band center@xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that even in the case of the disordered magnetic field , the conductance plateau transitions also occur in the same way as the disordered potential case .",
    "the disordered magnetic field system has been studied theoretically in connection to the fractional quantum hall effect at filling factor @xmath19@xcite . due to the advances in the fabrication technique",
    ", such a system has also been realized experimentally in a semiconductor heterostructure and its magnetotransport has been studied under various conditions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to clarify the effect of correlation in 2d disordered magnetic fields theoretically and experimentally .",
    "we consider a lattice model with spatially correlated disordered magnetic fields and examine numerically how the effect of correlation shows up in the conductance plateau transitions in such a system .",
    "it is then found that the effect appears as the change of the separation of successive plateau transitions , which is qualitatively different from that observed for the correlated disorder potential case .",
    "the origin of this change of the separation is also discussed semi - classically .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional system with disordered magnetic fields described by the hamiltonian on the square lattice @xmath20 the phases @xmath21 are determined so that the summation around the @xmath10th plaquette is equal to the magnetic flux @xmath22 through the plaquette , where @xmath23 stands for the flux quantum .",
    "the flux @xmath24 through the @xmath10th plaquette can be expressed as @xmath25 here @xmath4 denotes the uniform component of the magnetic fluxes , which determines the mean value of fluxes .",
    "the disordered component around the mean is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "it is assumed that the disordered component of the flux is distributed with the gaussian distribution with zero mean as @xmath27 the spatial correlation of the disordered components is assumed to be @xmath28 the position vector for the site @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath29 .",
    "all length scales are measured in units of the lattice constant .",
    "the spatially correlated fluxes are constructed from the uncorrelated fluxes @xmath30 s as @xcite @xmath31 when the uncorrelated fluxes @xmath30 s obey the gaussian distribution with variance @xmath32 , it is easily verified that @xmath26 satisfies the relations in eqs.([gauss ] ) and ( [ corr1 ] ) .",
    "the effective width @xmath33 is used to specify the disorder strength . in the case of the present lattice model , the flux @xmath24 and @xmath34 with an integer @xmath35 are equivalent with each other . to avoid the artifact of this periodicity @xcite , we confine ourselves to small values of @xmath36 and @xmath4 and to the fermi energy away from the band center .",
    "we consider a system with the length @xmath37 and the width @xmath38 having two leads attached to both ends of the system .",
    "the fixed boundary condition is assumed in the transverse direction .",
    "for the realization of the isotropic correlation for the magnetic fields in the sample region @xmath39 , we consider an additional regions of the width @xmath40 outside of the sample in performing the summation over the uncorrelated fluxes @xmath41 . by this procedure , we realize isotropic correlations of disordered fluxes in the sample region@xcite .    the two - terminal conductance @xmath42 is obtained by means of the landauer formula @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the transmission matrix , which is evaluated by the transfer matrix method@xcite .",
    "the width @xmath38 is set to be 20 .",
    "the smallest magnetic flux @xmath45 per plaquette is @xmath46 , and the corresponding magnetic length @xmath47 is about @xmath48 , much smaller than the system width @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to the existence of edge states along the boundaries of the present systems .",
    "we show in fig . [ fig2 ]",
    "the conductance of a long wire ( @xmath49 ) as a function of the fermi energy @xmath50 and the correlation length @xmath51 of the random magnetic fields .",
    "the parameters for the magnetic fields are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "independent samples are assumed for each set of parameters @xmath51 and @xmath50 throughout this section .",
    "it is clearly seen here that the plateau transitions shift toward higher energies as the correlation of random magnetic fields is increased .",
    "it should be noted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the distance between successive transitions , namely the plateau width , increases as the correlation of magnetic fields is increased .",
    "this means that the shift of the critical energy of the plateau transition associated with lower landau levels seems to be smaller than that associated with higher landau levels .",
    "it is to be recalled that in the case of the correlated disorder potential@xcite , the scale of shifts is common to all plateau transitions and the distance between plateau transitions remains to be the same as the bulk landau level separation ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the change of the critical energy in the random field case is therefore qualitatively different from that observed for the case of the potential correlation .",
    "this change in the separations of plateau transitions is absent for a short system ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , and hence this change is a specific feature to long wires .",
    "insensitivity of the critical energy to the correlation in a short system is consistent with the fact that the positions of the bulk landau levels are insensitive to the random magnetic field correlation as long as the disorder is rather weak @xcite . for a long wire , the present enhancement of the plateau width with increasing correlation",
    "is also observed for the case of @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this is therefore a general feature of the conductance along long wires in spatially correlated magnetic fields . in both cases ,",
    "the crossover is likely to take place when the correlation length @xmath51 is of the order of the magnetic length @xmath56 .    ,",

    "the magnetic length for @xmath4 is @xmath62 .",
    "independent sample is assumed for each set of parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    it is also to be mentioned in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the cmit for small correlation length @xmath51 does not necessarily occur at every bulk landau level . in this case",
    ", the conductance does not vanish at higher landau levels even in the absence of correlation ( see also fig .",
    "this indicates that in the present case , the mixing of the edge states and the bulk states is not strong enough to reduce the conductance to be zero .",
    "note that in the case of the potential disorder , the conductance vanishes at the centers of the bulk landau levels when the correlation is weak @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , it is also confirmed that the signature of cmit survives for larger correlation length @xmath51 than in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , because the magnetic length is larger .",
    "in order to clarify the origin of the present increase of the plateau width in the presence of the correlation of the random components of the magnetic fields , we investigate the positions of the critical energy more carefully . we find that in the absence of correlation , the critical energies coincide with the centers of the bulk landau subbands .",
    "the plateau width is therefore determined by the mean value @xmath4 of the disordered magnetic fields . on the other hand , in the presence of correlation ,",
    "it is likely that the plateau width becomes larger and is determined by a stronger field @xmath63 , which is effectively the maximum of the distribution of disordered magnetic fields .    in fig .",

    "this value of the magnetic field is effectively the maximum value realized in the present system since @xmath68 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines are those for @xmath66 and @xmath57 , equivalent to the positions of the bulk landau subbands .",
    "the results clearly suggest that the critical energy in the presence of correlation ( @xmath64 ) is in good agreement with the landau level position for the case of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "it is to be emphasized that when the correlation is switched off ( @xmath65 ) , the critical energies coincide with the landau level positions for the mean value of the fields @xmath57 instead of @xmath67 , even in the case of @xmath69 .",
    "these facts mean that the conductance plateau transitions of a long wire in the presence of correlation is effectively determined by the stronger field @xmath63 .     and @xmath70 in the case of @xmath49 , @xmath57 and @xmath71 as a function of the fermi energy @xmath50 .",

    "[ fig5 ] ]    we have carried out the same analysis also for a different strength of the magnetic fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the results are shown in fig .",
    "here we find again that the critical energies in the presence of correlation @xmath64 agree with the positions of the landau levels in the effective magnetic field @xmath73 . on the other hand , for uncorrelated case ( @xmath65 ) , the critical energies are identical to the landau level positions for the mean value @xmath74 .",
    "all these results support the conclusion that for the case of the correlated magnetic fields , the critical energies of the conductance plateau transition in long wires are determined by the effective field @xmath63 , which is of the order of the maximum value of the disordered magnetic fields in the system .",
    "the plateau width therefore becomes larger , accordingly .     and",

    "in figs . [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , the fluctuation of the conductance around the critical energies is seen , especially at higher energies . to see the origin of this fluctuation of the conductance",

    "the results for 5 samples of different random magnetic field configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . here",
    "it is clearly seen that the fluctuation of the conductance seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is due to the sample dependence of the critical energies , which originates from the plateau width dependence on the sample .",
    "the critical energies therefore depend on the sample particularly at higher steps .",
    "this plateau width dependence is naturally understood as a consequence of the sample dependence of the effective field which determines the critical energies of the system . as we have shown in the previous section ,",
    "the effective field is of the order of the maximum value of the disordered magnetic field in the system .",
    "the critical energy @xmath76 would be determined by the effective field as @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the cyclotron frequency corresponding to the effective magnetic field .",
    "the fluctuation of the effective field is equivalent to the fluctuation of @xmath78 , which is independent of the energy .",
    "the fluctuation of @xmath76 is therefore larger for larger @xmath1 .",
    "it is to be noted that this plateau width dependence on the sample has not been observed for the case of the correlated potential @xcite .",
    "is zero for all samples .",
    "the parameters are taken to be @xmath64 , @xmath49 ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath79 . the vertical lines and dotted lines represent the positions of the critical energies in the absence of disorder ( @xmath66 ) for @xmath67 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "[ fig7 ] ]    now we discuss what determines the effective field of the sample which governs the conductance plateau transitions of a long wire in correlated disordered magnetic fields .",
    "let us consider the case of the second sample from the bottom in fig .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the magnetic field landscape of the important part of the sample .",
    "the length @xmath80 of this part is only @xmath81 .",
    "remarkably , this small part effectively determines the transport of the whole system ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we evaluate the conductance of this small part separately and compare it with the conductance of the whole system ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) . in spite of the fact that the length of this small part is only 3 percent of the whole system ,",
    "the conductance steps are almost reproduced .",
    "it is therefore clear that this small part is crucial to the conductance of the whole wire and that the effective field , which governs the conductance plateau transition , is determined by the magnetic field strength of this part .    ) with @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath64 .",
    "the part ( @xmath81 ) , which is crucial to the conductance of the whole system , is shown . the horizontal ( vertical ) direction is across ( along ) the wire .",
    "the region where the magnetic field is stronger than its average is shown by the gray scale .",
    "in particular , the magnetic fluxes larger than @xmath63 are presented by the black region .",
    "[ fig8 ] ]     ( solid curve ) .",
    "the conductance of the whole system is also presented by the dashed curve for comparison .",
    "the excellent coincidence between the solid and the dashed curves clearly proves that this small part effectively determines the conductance of the whole system .",
    "[ fig9 ] ]    it is important to note that in this part , a region where the magnetic field is stronger than the mean lies across the wire ( fig . [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "in such a region , the number of edge states is less than the average .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that such bridge structure of a stronger magnetic field region acts as an effective barrier against the transport along the wire and the conductance is determined by the number of edge states there . if the correlation is absent , the typical size of the region with stronger magnetic field is of the order of the lattice constant and the probability to have such a region across the wire is exponentially small as has been discussed in our previous paper@xcite . for the case of short systems , it is obvious that the probability is also small .",
    "in fact , this bridge structure of a stronger magnetic field region appears only once or twice in the sample with @xmath49 in the case of @xmath64 .",
    "this argument naturally explains why the increase of the plateau width occurs only in a long wire with a large correlation length @xmath51 .",
    "the probability to have such a region across the wire is essentially the same as that for the potential barrier discussed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we have investigated numerically the conductance of the quantum hall wires with correlated magnetic fields and examined how the effect of correlation shows up in the conductance plateau transition .",
    "it has been clearly demonstrated that in the presence of correlation @xmath85 the plateau width becomes larger than that for the uncorrelated case .",
    "it has been shown that the larger plateau width in the presence of correlation is determined by the effective field , which is of the order of the maximum value of the magnetic field in the system .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the bridge structure of the high magnetic field region across the wire essentially determines the effective field and therefore governs the conductance plateau transition of long quantum hall wires .",
    "the change in the critical energy of the plateau transition is qualitatively different from that for the correlated potential case , where the plateau width is unchanged by the potential correlation @xcite . in spite of this apparent difference",
    ", the change of the plateau width can also be understood semi - classically by the fact that the number of edge states for a given energy at the bridge structure is smallest and therefore effectively determines the conductance of the whole system .    in the present paper , we have focused on the plateau transitions in the case of the correlated magnetic field , which is more relevant for actual experiments than the uncorrelated case . before concluding this paper , we make a remark about the cmit in the case of the uncorrelated magnetic field . in fig .",
    "10 , the conductances in the uncorrelated magnetic field are shown for the cases of @xmath86 and of @xmath84 .",
    "the uniform component @xmath45 is @xmath87 in both cases . for the case of the larger fluctuation @xmath86",
    ", the precursor of the cmit can be seen .",
    "it is therefore likely that the fluctuation larger than the mean is necessary to obtain the clear insulating region . on the other hand ,",
    "the clear conductance plateaus would vanish when the fluctuation is larger than the mean .",
    "we have therefore confined ourselves to the case where the fluctuation @xmath88 of the magnetic field is smaller than its mean @xmath4 to discuss the plateau transitions .",
    "it would be worth pointing out that in the previous numerical studies of the transport properties in the two - dimensional disordered magnetic fields @xcite , the scattering by the random magnetic fields has been shown to be weak and quantitatively different from that by the random potential .     as a function of the fermi energy @xmath50 .",
    "the length of the system is @xmath49 and the uniform component of the magnetic field is @xmath57 .",

    "<S> quantum transport properties in quantum hall wires in the presence of spatially correlated disordered magnetic fields are investigated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the correlation drastically changes the transport properties associated with the edge state , in contrast to the naive expectation that the correlation simply reduces the effect of disorder . in the presence of correlation , </S>",
    "<S> the separation between the successive conductance plateau transitions becomes larger than the bulk landau level separation determined by the mean value of the disordered magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the transition energies coincide with the landau levels in an effective magnetic field stronger than the mean value of the disordered magnetic field . for a long wire , </S>",
    "<S> the strength of this effective magnetic field is of the order of the maximum value of the magnetic fields in the system . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the effective field is determined by a part where the stronger magnetic field region connects both edges of the wire . </S>"
