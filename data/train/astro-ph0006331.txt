    "in paper i , by comparing the fbs ( markarian et al . 1989 ) and bqs ( green et al .",
    "1986 ) surveys in their area in common , we derived a completeness of @xmath170% for the bqs .",
    "a number of bright agns have since been discovered in the area which , together with our new spectroscopic observations , allowed us to refine our previous estimate of the bqs completeness .",
    "we have obtained new spectra for 11 fbs objects .",
    "the observations were carried out on november 25 , 1998 and january 1415 , 1999 at the byurakan astrophysical observatory ( bao ) and at the observatoire de haute - provence ( ohp ) , respectively .",

( 2000 ) give @xmath0 17.0 , while the usno @xmath6 magnitude is 14.3 ; but this object has a moderate redshift ( @xmath7 0.127 ) ; moreover its apm @xmath6 magnitude ( irwin et al . 1994 ) is 17.66 ; we therefore adopted the schwope et al .",
    "mag and excluded it from the  complete \" sample .      the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) was built by matching the vla first survey with the cambridge automated plate measuring machine ( apm ) catalog of poss - i objects ( irwin et al .",
    "1994 ) ; it covers an area of 2682 deg@xmath2 in the north galactic cap ; it contains 1238 objects brighter than 17.8 mag on the poss - i @xmath8 plates ( white et al .",
    "about 1180 square degrees are within the fbs area ; they contain 38 first radio sources identified with an agn brighter than @xmath0  17.0 at @xmath9  30 ; nine are bright qsos ( @xmath10  16.0 ) , three ( cso  900 , firstj1306@xmath53915 and rxsj17102@xmath53344 ) being new .",
    "although the numbers are small , this suggests that the  complete \" sample we built in paper i is only 67@xmath415% complete .",
    "according to white et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , qsos with radio emission above the first 1 mjy limit constitute about 25% of all qsos brighter than @xmath11 17.6 , but for qsos brighter than @xmath0 16.4 , the fbqs qso density is indistinguishable from the density of optically selected qsos .",
    "nevertheless , of the 15 bright qsos known prior to the first survey in the area common to the first and fbs surveys , only six ( 40% ) have been detected as first radio sources ; therefore the complete identification of the first sources with bright starlike objects could not yield a complete survey of bright qsos .",
    "+ a number of recent papers are devoted to the optical identification of rass sources ( beuermann et al .",
    "1999 ; cao et al . 1999 ; grazian et al . 2000 ; schwope et al .",
    "2000 ; wei et al . 1999 ; xu et al .",
    "one of the new identifications is rxsj12043@xmath54330 , a qso at @xmath7  0.663 ( xu et al .",
    "1999 ) ; it is also fbs1201@xmath5437 ( fbs#302 ) or pg1201@xmath5436 , which had been classified as a dc white dwarf by green et al .",
    "its aps @xmath6 magnitude is 16.23 ; it is therefore not bright enough to be included in our  complete \" sample .",
    "+ nineteen rass sources are now identified with a bright qso in the area discussed in this paper ( including the three new first qsos ) ; of the 17 fbs or bqs bright qsos in our sample ( table [ brightqso ] ) , 12 ( 70% ) are rosat all sky survey ( rass ) x - ray sources , suggesting that the total number of bright qsos is equal to 19/0.70 @xmath12 27 ( if all optically bright , x - ray sources have been discovered ) .",
    "our  complete \" sample of bright qsos ( table [ brightqso ] ) contains 29 objects brighter than @xmath0 16.16 ( @xmath10 16.00 ) , three of them ( indicated by a ",
    "n \" in the last column of table [ brightqso ] ) are not within the pg area .",
    "the area common to the pg and fbs surveys at @xmath9 30   ( @xmath12250 deg@xmath2 ) contains 26 bright qsos ( 13 pg qsos and 13 others ) ( but there are 17 pg qsos with @xmath13 16.16 in the area ; this larger number is probably due to the eddington ( 1940 ) effect , the pg magnitudes being affected by relatively large errors , @xmath14 0.37 mag ) . from these data ,",
    "we derive a surface density of 0.012 deg@xmath3 , which is to be compared with the original value of the pg survey : 0.0064 deg@xmath3 , implying a maximum completeness of 53@xmath410% for the pg survey . + grazian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have cross - correlated the rass with photometric databases in an 8164 deg@xmath2 area of the northern sky at @xmath15 30 , selecting all coincidences brighter than @xmath16  15.4 ; from this , they derive a surface density of bright ( @xmath17  15.5 ) qsos ( defined as agns with @xmath1823.0 ) of 10@xmath42 10@xmath19 deg@xmath3 and conclude that the true surface density of such objects is about three times larger than that derived from the pg survey .",
    "however , they do not specify how the @xmath20 magnitude of their objects was derived .",
    "their sample contains 46 qsos ; 15 of them have @xmath21  0.20 ; we have extracted from the aps catalogue the @xmath6 magnitudes for 12 of them ( for the three others , these magnitudes are unavailable ) ; it turns out that only one ( j172320.5@xmath5341756 ) has @xmath22 15.34 , corresponding to @xmath17  15.5 , suggesting that the @xmath6 magnitudes used by grazian et al . are underestimated and , consequently , the surface density overestimated . + lamontagne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claim that they found a surface density of bright qsos three times larger than the pg value .",
    "they have searched for uv - excess stellar - like objects with @xmath17 16.5 and @xmath23 @xmath240.6 in a 840 deg@xmath2 area covering the south galactic cap ; the errors in the @xmath20 magnitudes are estimated to be 0.30 mag _ rms_.",
    "they have found 228 such objects which have all been spectroscopically identified ; 32 are agns , out of which only eleven are brighter than @xmath0  16.16 and @xmath2524.0 ( including 0117@xmath262837 which , according to grupe et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , has a redshift of 0.349 rather than 0.055 ) .",
    "we derive a surface density or 0.013 deg@xmath3 , in agreement with our value and only twice the pg value .",
    "in paper i , we compared the surface density of qsos in the bright quasar survey and in the first byurakan survey and concluded that the completeness of the bqs is of the order of 70% ; wisotzki et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have found that the bqs is 68% complete from a comparison with the hamburg / eso survey , in agreement with our previoys estimate .",
    "based on a number of recently published data , as well as on our own new observations , we redetermined the surface density of qsos brighter than @xmath0  16.16 in the bqs area to be @xmath10.012 deg@xmath3 , implying that the completeness of the bqs is 53@xmath410% .",
    "it should be stressed however that the numbers involved are quite small , and that larger areas should be investigated before a definitive value of the surface density of bright qsos could be determined .",
