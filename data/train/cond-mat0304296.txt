    "similarly , we find @xmath117 the deterministic phase shift due to the different dipolar energies for parallel and antiparallel spin configurations could be accounted for at the end of a quantum algorithm if no other error sources were present .",

    "this shows that decoherence effected by magnetic dipolar interactions is indeed smaller for spin cluster qubits than for single spins .",
    "readout of the spin cluster qubit is achieved by measuring the individual spins within the cluster ( @xmath135 ) or the state of the total spin of the cluster ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the measurement of individual spins still is a considerable experimental challenge . however , as has been shown theoretically ,  @xcite measurement of single spins is feasible via charge degrees of freedom .",

    "a selective readout of several spins of the spin cluster qubit would also reduce the requirements on the readout sensitivity .",
    "for example , the sublattice spin @xmath140 for @xmath47 is twice as large as the total magnetic moment @xmath141 and could be measured after separating the electron spins at even and odd sites of the cluster .",
    "this illustrates that readout of single spins is sufficient but not necessary to measure the state of the spin cluster qubit .",
    "spin readout can also be effected by optical means . a scheme for gate operation based on pauli",
    "blocking has been suggested recently .",
    "@xcite in a similar way , the creation of a spin polarized exciton by a circularly polarized laser beam and the subsequent obervation of the reemitted photon would allow one to determine the spin state of a single electron .",
    "the underlying principle is that , for a quantum dot with an electron spin pointing up , pauli s exclusion principle prohibits the creation of an exciton in which the electron with spin up occupies the same orbital state .",
    "the creation of an exciton , which can be observed by the photon emitted on recombination , is possible only if the electron spin in the quantum dot points opposite to the one of the exciton created by the laser beam .",
    "however , for qubits based on spins in a single quantum dot , the minimum laser focus on the order of the wavelength puts severe constraints on an optical readout scheme .",
    "these constraints are relaxed for spin cluster qubits where it is sufficient to have a laser spot size with a diamater smaller than the size of the spin cluster qubit .",
    "the formation of a spin cluster qubit from an odd number of antiferromagnetically coupled spins requires little control over intracluster exchange constants .",
    "although both the energy gap @xmath17 and matrix elements such as @xmath142 depend on the spatial variation of exchange constants , the general principle of assembling several spins into a cluster qubit remains valid .    in order to demonstrate the robustness of our spin cluster qubit against a variation of exchange constants , we return to the isotropic spin chain but now allow for varying @xmath143 in eq .",

    "<S> we show that a wide range of spin clusters with antiferromagnetic intracluster exchange interaction allows one to define a qubit . for these spin cluster qubits , initialization , quantum gate operation , and readout are possible using the same techniques as for single spins . quantum gate operation for the spin cluster qubit does not require control over the intracluster exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> electric and magnetic fields necessary to effect quantum gates need only be controlled on the length scale of the spin cluster rather than the scale for a single spin . here </S>",

    "<S> we illustrate the advantages of spin cluster qubits for various suggested implementations of spin qubits and analyze the scaling of decoherence time with spin cluster size . </S>"
