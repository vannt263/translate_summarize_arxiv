    "with the discovery of high @xmath1 superconductivity in the iron - arsenides in 2008 ,  @xcite researchers found renewed interest and hope in understanding the mechanism of high @xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "@xcite although much has been learned , the superconducting mechanism is still poorly understood .",
    "earlier reports suggest that optimal doping for superconductors places the system in the vicinity of magnetic instability as evidenced by the largest enhancement of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afsf ) near @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite fermi surface nesting between hole bands at the brillouin zone center and electron bands near the zone edge may be associated with the afsf , which in turn may cause cooper pairing .",
    "in such a scenario , overdoping electrons suppresses the nesting effects by filling up the hole bands , and thereby suppressing afsf and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite in the simple iron - selenide superconductor , fese ( @xmath6 9 k  @xcite ) , application of pressure alone can also push @xmath1 as high as 37 k.  @xcite furthermore , afsf were shown to enhance in direct correlation with the enhancement of pressure and @xmath1 ,  @xcite reinforcing the view that afsf and the superconducting mechanism may be linked .",
    "recently , guo _ et al .",
    "_ reported the discovery of superconductivity in k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite through intercalation of k into fese , @xmath1 is again pushed much higher ( @xmath10 33 k ) .",
    "recent arpes measurements , however , revealed that unlike in iron - arsenide high @xmath1 systems , _ all _ the hole bands near the center of the first brillouin zone may be filled by electrons donated by k@xmath11 ions .",
    "@xcite this means that fermi surface nesting effects would not induce afsf , yet @xmath1 is still very high .",
    "in fact , earlier nmr results revealed no enhancement of the afsf toward @xmath1 in this system .",
    "@xcite    in the present study , we explore the effect of substituting sulphur ( s ) into the se sites of k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite as shown in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 , s substitution progressively suppresses @xmath1 , enabling us to conduct a systematic microscopic nmr investigation of the evolution of electronic properties in going from a high-@xmath1 superconductor to a non - superconductor .",
    "we examine two concentrations , one with z = 0.8 ( 40% substitution ) , and one with z = 1.6 ( 80% substitution ) , and compare the new nmr results with our report for k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 ( z = 0 ) .",
    "@xcite sulphur substitution tends to generate a chemical pressure in the system , because s and se have the same valence but s has an ionic radius less than half of that of se .",
    "the lattice constant along the crystal @xmath12-axis indeed decreases from @xmath1014.0 to 13.9  and then to 13.7    as s concentration goes from z = 0 to 0.8 to 1.6 , respectively ; the lattice is compressed within the @xmath13 plane as well , so overall the fe - se bond length is shortened .",
    "the systematic suppression of @xmath1 with s substitution mimics the situation in fese , where over - pressurizing results in suppression of @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the evolution of electronic properties in overpressured fese has been poorly explored because extremely high pressure ( @xmath14 9 gpa ) is required .",
    "@xcite thus a microscopic investigation of s - substituted k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 may provide us with a new path to investigate the possible correlations between @xmath1 , structure , and afsf when physical or chemical pressure suppresses @xmath1 .",
    ", as a function of sulphur concentration , z. filled circles represent current samples used for nmr , measured _ in situ _ in zero magnetic field , while open triangles represent data at the source of crystal growth .",
    "@xcite solid and dashed lines are a ` guide - to - eye'.,width=288,height=326 ]    in what follows we will present new @xmath0se nmr data for k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4s@xmath5 , and show that spin excitations are suppressed with s substitution . in section ii we will briefly present our experimental procedures . in section iii we will summarize our experimental results , paying particular attention to nmr knight shift and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/t@xmath9 data , and discuss some implications . in section iv we summarize our findings and conclude .",
    "single crystals of k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4s@xmath5 were grown using the self - flux method .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements were obtained at 300 k using 0.3184    wave - length radiation on ground samples .",
    "the xrd data were then refined with the general structure analysis system .",
    "@xcite average stoichiometries were determined using energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) in a jeol jsm-6500 scanning electron microscope .",
    "the xrd data show superlattice reflections which incorporate an fe ordered vacancy site .",
    "potassium content as well as fe defect content increase slightly with s substitution , as @xmath15 0.64 , 0.7 , and 0.8 in k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 , k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath16s@xmath17 , and k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath18s@xmath19 respectively .",
    "full detail of the growth method , structural refinement , phase diagram , and other properties may be found elsewhere .",
    "@xcite we determined the @xmath1 of each of our nmr samples _ in situ _ by measuring the frequency shift of our nmr tank circuit .",
    "@xcite the @xmath1 of our nmr samples is summarized in fig . 1 , together with other compositions .",
    "we carried out nmr measurements in an applied magnetic field of b @xmath20 tesla applied along the crystal @xmath12-axis . by taking the fast fourier transformation ( fft ) of the envelope of the spin - echo",
    "we were able to obtain our nmr lineshapes . to measure the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate , 1/t@xmath9 , we applied an inversion @xmath21 pulse or saturation comb pulses prior to our spin - echo sequence .",
    "2 we compare @xmath0se nmr lineshapes for different sulphur concentrations . once scaled according to selenium content in each crystal , integrated intensities for each system are equal within experimental uncertainties .",
    "the narrowest lineshapes are observed for the @xmath22 sample ; both s substituted samples exhibit line broadening , indicative of disorder effects in local electronic and structural properties at the se sites .",
    "se nmr fft lineshapes of k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4s@xmath5 for z = 0.8 and z = 1.6 at 50 k , observed in b = 8.33 t. we also show k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 for comparison .",
    "@xcite the lineshapes have been normalized for an equal integrated intensity and fitted with gaussian curves with full widths at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath10 4.5 khz , 24 khz , and 14 khz for z = 0 , 0.8 , and 1.6 , respectively .",
    "note the systematic lowering of the nmr peak frequency with increased s content.,width=288,height=326 ]    in addition to the change in shape of the fft , the nmr peak frequency is systematically lowered with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "peaks for the z = 0.8 and z = 1.6 samples are found at 67.78 mhz and 67.76 mhz respectively . with an expected larmor frequency of @xmath24 = @xmath25",
    "b = 67.622 mhz , where @xmath25/2@xmath21 = 8.118 mhz / t is the _",
    "gyromagnetic ratio _ for @xmath0se , this means that the _ knight shift _ is lowered with increasing s concentration as well .",
    "the @xmath0se nmr knight shift , @xmath8 , may be written as @xmath26 @xmath27 is the hyperfine coupling constant between the @xmath0se nuclear spins which we are observing and electron spins in their vicinity .",
    "@xmath28 is the average spin susceptibility of these electrons .",
    "the knight shift is therefore an excellent probe for the uniform * q = 0 * wave vector mode of local spin susceptibility in bulk materials , free from the influence of impurity phases .",
    "@xmath29 is a temperature independent chemical shift which arises from the orbital motion of electrons . from the measurements below @xmath1 in k@xmath2fe@xmath7se@xmath7 we estimate the lower bound of @xmath29 to be @xmath10 0.11 % without diamagnetic corrections .",
    "@xcite @xmath29 may be slightly dependent on s - substitution effects .    in fig .",
    "3 we summarize the temperature and s - content dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "we find some qualitative similarities in the behaviour of all three compositions , but the magnitude of the spin contribution to the shift is reduced significantly in the s substituted samples near room temperature . in principle , the overall suppression of the spin contribution @xmath30 = @xmath31 may be caused by a reduction in the hyperfine coupling constant , @xmath27 , induced by structural changes .",
    "however , the fe - se bond length shortens as one substitutes s ,  @xcite which would cause greater overlap of wavefunctions between fe and se(s ) layers .",
    "naively , @xmath27 would therefore become larger .",
    "since we see an overall _ decrease _ in knight shift , this implies @xmath28 would have to drop more substantially if @xmath27 indeed increases .",
    "that is , our results in fig .",
    "3 imply that s substitution suppresses @xmath28 .    turning our attention to the temperature dependence of @xmath8 ,",
    "all samples exhibit a monotonic decrease in knight shift with temperature , which is consistent with behaviour previously reported in other iron - based superconductors such as lafeaso@xmath32f@xmath2 ,  @xcite ba(fe@xmath32co@xmath2)@xmath7as@xmath7 ,  @xcite , fese ,  @xcite , and ba@xmath2k@xmath32fe@xmath7as@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite in ba(fe@xmath32co@xmath2)@xmath7as@xmath7 the temperature dependence of knight shift remains qualitatively similar regardless of doping level .",
    "@xcite in the present case , however , the temperature dependence becomes far less pronounced with s substitution .",
    "the increase in knight shift at higher temperature for the undoped ( z = 0 ) sample may be caused by the presence of excited states of the spins , which may be reached at higher temperatures with sufficient thermal energy .",
    "in such a pseudo - gap scenario ,  @xcite our new observation implies that in the s - substituted systems either these excited states are diminished or the energy threshold required to excite spins is too great ( and beyond our temperature range ) .",
    "se nmr knight shift , @xmath8 , along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 is presented for comparison .",
    "arrows mark @xmath1 = 25 k ( z = 0 ) and 13 k ( z = 0.8 ) in b = 8.33 t for the two superconducting samples as determined _ in situ _ by the change in tuning frequency of the nmr tank circuit . the dashed curve is a phenomenological fit with a pseudo - gap , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 = 435 k for all samples . overall , @xmath8 and therefore the * q = 0 * component of @xmath28 are suppressed with increased s doping.,width=288,height=326 ]    the dashed line through each of the three samples represents a purely phenomenological fit to the normal state data , with @xmath33 , where @xmath35 represents a pseudo - gap , @xmath36 represents the @xmath8 value near @xmath1 , and @xmath37 is a constant . we had hoped to find a systematic change in @xmath35 with s substitution but the uncertainty in its magnitude is too large because it is extremely sensitive to the choice of @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , _ all three _ samples can be fit with the same @xmath34 = 435 k as previously found for undoped k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite we emphasize that @xmath35 can be varied by as much as a factor of 2 while still maintaining a good fit to the data , and so it does not provide sufficient resolution to discern the difference between the pseudo - gaps .",
    "we have previously encountered this situation in ba(fe@xmath32co@xmath2)@xmath7as@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    within a conventional fermi liquid picture , the knight shift would be dominated by pauli spin susceptibility , @xmath38 .",
    "a decrease in @xmath8 therefore might suggest that the density of states at the fermi energy , @xmath39 , decreases as the concentration of s increases and temperature decreases . to check such a scenario beyond the * q = 0 * mode of spin susceptibility",
    ", we must examine the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate , 1/t@xmath9 .",
    "4 shows representative signal recovery after saturation recorded for t@xmath9 measurements for all three samples .",
    "single exponential fits are satisfactory for all compositions , as expected for @xmath0se with nuclear spin i = 1/2 .",
    "we can clearly see the general trend that substitution of s slows the spin - lattice relaxation . in fig .",
    "5 we present 1/t@xmath9 t ( i.e. 1/t@xmath9 divided by t ) as a function of temperature .",
    "1/t@xmath9 t measures the wave - vector * q * integral of the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility , @xmath40(*q*,f@xmath41 ) , in the first brillouin zone ; @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the wave vector dependent hyperfine form factor , and @xmath44 67.78 mhz is the resonance frequency . in the optimally doped regime , many iron - arsenide systems show an enhancement of low frequency afsf as reflected by 1/t@xmath9 t as one approaches @xmath1 with decreasing temperature .",
    "@xcite the fese system exhibits an analogous enhancement of afsf as well , and a greater enhancement in afsf reflected by 1/t@xmath9 t correlates with higher t@xmath45 .",
    "@xcite for ba(fe@xmath32co@xmath2)@xmath7as@xmath7 , once the system enters the overdoped regime the enhancement of afsf and @xmath1 both begin to decrease .",
    "@xcite     recovery curves measured at the center of the fft lineshapes in fig . 1 at 50 k. we normalize signal intensity for clarity .",
    "solid lines represent single exponential fits through each data set , the argument of which gives our t@xmath9 value .",
    "the strong trend toward slower relaxation rate with increased s substitution is evident.,width=288,height=326 ]    t as a function of temperature for z = 0 , 0.8 , and 1.6 , with magnetic field b = 8.33 t applied along the crystal @xmath12-axis .",
    "relaxation rate gets progressively slower with s substitution ; temperature dependence weakens as well .",

    "@xcite the lack of enhancement in 1/t@xmath9 t near @xmath1 is analogous to the case of overdoped ba(fe@xmath32co@xmath2)@xmath7as@xmath7 and suggests that k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath7 may already be in the overdoped regime . in k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath16s@xmath17",
    "we observed an analogous trend with overall suppression of 1/t@xmath9 t , and hence spin excitations",
    ". thus suppression of t@xmath45 with s substitution in fig .",
    "1 is accompanied by suppresion of spin excitations . for non - superconducting k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath18s@xmath19 , 1/t@xmath9 t is nearly temperature independent , similar to overdoped , non - superconducting , metallic ba(fe@xmath46co@xmath47)@xmath7as@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite we caution that our finding does not necessarily imply there are no antiferromagnetic correlations in these systems . our results in fig .",
    "5 do not rule out the possible enhancement of afsf at energy scales much higher than @xmath48ev .",
    "in addition , 1/t@xmath9 t measures the _ summation _ of the wave - vector * q * , @xmath49 , meaning that small afsf may be present for some * q*-modes , and only that the net sum shows no enhancement .     vs @xmath50 .",
    "a constant slope would indicate the presence of the korringa relation , an indicator for fermi liquid theory .",
    "the extrapolated horizontal intercept corresponds to @xmath29 .",

    "6 we plot 1/@xmath55 vs @xmath50 . in a canonical fermi liquid , 1/@xmath56 as a result of fermi s golden rule .",
    "the korringa relation , @xmath57 where c is a constant and @xmath58 represents the spin contribution to knight shift , is thus an excellent test for the applicability of fermi liquid theory in this system .",
    "the undoped sample exhibits negative curvature in fig . 6 , and",
    "as reported earlier it does not appear to fit the korringa relation .",
    "@xcite k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath16s@xmath17 also exhibits positive curvature , which suggests that it does not fit in a simple fermi liquid picture either .",
    "the k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath18s@xmath19 data may exhibit a somewhat closer to linear relationship , but this could be fictitious in view of the very weak temperature dependences of @xmath8 and 1/t@xmath9 t in the temperature range of our investigation .",
    "in addition , extrapolation of the apparent linear fit to the intercept of the horizontal axis implies @xmath29 is as large as @xmath10 0.22% for k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath18s@xmath19 .",
    "that is , if the fermi liquid picture applies to the non - superconducting k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath18s@xmath19 , @xmath29 would have to double in magnitude compared with superconducting k@xmath2fe@xmath3s@xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we have reported a systematic variation of the electronic properties of the recently discovered high @xmath1 superconductor , k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4s@xmath5 with z = 0 , 0.8 , and 1.6 , where s substitution generates chemical pressure . using @xmath0se nmr ,",

    "the pseudogap - like behaviour is nearly non - existent for the non - superconducting z = 1.6 sample .",
    "none of the k@xmath2fe@xmath3se@xmath4s@xmath5 systems _ conclusively _ satisfy the korringa relation expected for canonical fermi liquids , but the z = 1.6 composition may in fact be closer to a fermi liquid .",
    "it has been suggested that in fe - as systems , the pnictogen height , i.e. the distance between the pnictogen and the fe plane , acts as a tuner for superconductivity , where a certain height optimizes @xmath1 .",
