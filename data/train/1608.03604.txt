    "over the past two decades , the theory of networks proved to be a powerful tool for understanding individual complex systems  @xcite .",
    "however , it is now increasingly appreciated that complex systems do not exist in isolation , but interact with each other  @xcite .",
    "indeed , an array of phenomena  from cascading failures  @xcite to diffusion  @xcite  can only be fully understood if these interactions are taken into account .",
    "traditional network theory is not sufficient to describe the structure of such systems , so in response to this challenge , the paradigm of multilayer networks is being actively developed .",
    "here we study a fundamental , yet overlooked aspect of multilayer networks : each individual layer can operate at a different timescale . particularly , we address the problem of controlling multilayer , multi - timescale systems focusing on two - layer multiplex networks .",
    "recently significant efforts have been made to uncover how the underlying network structure of a system affects our ability to influence its behavior  @xcite . however , despite the appearance of coupled systems from infrastructure to biology , the existing literature  with a few notable exceptions  @xcite  has focused on control of networks in isolation , and the role of timescales remains unexplored .",
    "control of multilayer networks is important for many applications .",
    "for example , consider a ceo aiming to lead a company consisting of employees and management .",
    "studying the network of managers or the network of employees in isolation does not take into account important interactions between the different levels of hierarchy of the company . on the other hand , treating the system as one large network ignores important differences between the dynamics of the different levels , e.g.",
    "management may meet weekly , while employees are in daily interaction .",
    "in general , the interaction of timescales plays an important role in organization theory  @xcite . or consider gene regulation in a living cell .",
    "external stimuli activate signaling pathways which through a web of protein - protein interactions affect transcription factors responsible for gene expression .",
    "the activation of a signaling pathway happens on the timescale of seconds , while gene expression typically takes hours  @xcite . as a third example , consider an operator of an online social network who wants to enhance the spread of certain information by interacting with its users .",
    "however , a user may subscribe to multiple social networking services and may opt to share news encountered in one network through a different one  out of reach of the operator .",
    "the dynamics of user interaction on different websites can be very different depending on user habits and the services offered  @xcite .",
    "for example the url shortening service bit.ly reports that the half - life of shared links depends on the social networking platform used : half the clicks on a link happened within 2.8 hours after posting on twitter , within 3.2 hours on facebook and within 7.4 hours on youtube  @xcite .",
    "common features of these examples are that ( i )  each interacting subsystem is described by a separate complex network ; ( ii )  the dynamics of each subsystem operate on a different , but often comparable timescale and ( iii )  the external controller directly interacts with only one of the subsystems . here",
    "we study the control properties of a model that incorporates these common features , yet remains tractable . more specifically , we study discrete - time linear dynamics on two - layer multiplex networks , meaning that we assume one - to - one coupling between the nodes of the two layers .",
    "this choice ensures both analytical tractability and the isolation of the role of timescales from the effect of more complex multilayer network structure . identifying the underlying mechanisms that govern the controllability of this simple model provides crucial insight into disentangling how our ability to control real interacting complex systems is affected by a variety of sources of complexity .",
    "so far only limited work investigated controllability of multilayer networks .",
    "menichetti et al .",
    "investigated the controllability of two - layer multiplex networks governed by linear dynamics such that the dynamics of the two layers are not coupled , but the input signals in the two layers are applied to the same set of nodes  @xcite .",
    "yuan et al .",
    "identified the minimum number of inputs necessary for full control of diffusion dynamics , allowing the controller to interact with any layer  @xcite .",
    "zhang et al . investigated the controllable subspace of multilayer networks with linear dynamics without timescale separation if the controller is limited to interact with only one layer ; showing that it is more efficient to directly control peripheral nodes than central ones  @xcite .",
    "here we also limit the controller to one layer , yet by exploring the minimum input problem , we offer a direct metric which allows us to compare our findings to previous results for single - layer networks  @xcite .",
    "more so , the key innovation of our work is that we take into account the timescale of the dynamics of each layer , a mostly overlooked aspect of multilayer networks .",
    "it is worth mentioning the recent work investigating the related , but distinct problem of controllability of networks with time - delayed linear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the key difference between time - delay and timescale difference is that for time - delayed dynamics the state of a node will depend on some previous state of its neighbors ; however , the typical time to change the state of a node remains the same throughout the system . while in case of timescale difference",
    ", the typical time needed for changes to happen can be different in different parts of the system .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a simple model that captures some common properties of multilayer networks and we describe the problem setup . in sec .",
    "[ sec : min_input_prob ] , we develop a theory to determine the minimum number of inputs required for controlling multiplex , multi - timescale networks with discrete - time linear dynamics relying on graph combinatorial methods . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we use networks with tunable degree distribution to systematically uncover the role of network structure and timescale separation .",
    "we study three scenarions : no timescale separation , layer i operates faster and layer ii operates faster . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we provide a discussion of our results and we outline open questions .",
    "we aim to study the controllability of coupled complex dynamical systems with the following properties : ( i ) each subsystem ( layer ) is described by a complex network ; ( ii ) the operation of each layer is characterized by a different timescale and ( iii ) the controller only interacts directly with one of the layers .",
    "we propose a model that satisfies these requirements and yet is simple enough to remain tractable .",
    "we focus on two - layer multiplex systems , meaning that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the nodes of the two layers .",
    "the model is defined by a weighted directed two - layer multiplex network @xmath1 which consists of two networks @xmath2 and @xmath3 called layers and a set of links @xmath4 connecting the nodes of the different layers . each layer @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) consists of a set of nodes @xmath7 and a set of links @xmath8 , where a directed link @xmath9 is an ordered node pair and a weight representing that node @xmath10 influences node @xmath11 with strength @xmath12 .",
    "the two layers are connected by link set @xmath13 , in other words , there is directed one - to - one coupling from layer i to layer ii ( fig .  [ fig:3examples]a ) .",
    "although the links are weighted , the exact values of the weights do not have to be known for our purposes .",
    "our goal is to control the system by only interacting directly with layer i. we study linear discrete - time dynamics @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent the state of nodes in layer i and ii ; the matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the transposed weighted adjacency matrices of layer i and ii , capturing their internal dynamics . the weighted diagonal matrix @xmath19 captures how layer i affects layer ii .",
    "vector @xmath20 provides the set of independent inputs and the matrix @xmath21 defines how the inputs are coupled to the system . to differentiate between the function @xmath22 and an instance of the function at a given time step",
    ", we refer to a component @xmath23 of vector @xmath22 as an independent input , and we call its value at time step @xmath24 , @xmath25 , a signal .    finally , @xmath26 are the timescale parameters of each subsystem , meaning that the state of layer i is updated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamics ] ) every @xmath27th time step ; and layer ii is updated every @xmath28th time step .",
    "and @xmath29 is the kronecker comb , meaning that layer i directly impacts the dynamics of layer ii if the two layers simultaneously update .",
    "we investigate three scenarios : ( i ) the subsystems operate on the same timescale , i.e. @xmath30 ; ( ii ) layer i updates faster , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; and ( iii ) layer ii updates faster @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we seek full control of the system as defined by kalman  @xcite , meaning that with the proper choice of @xmath22 , we can steer the system from any initial state to any final state in finite time .",
    "to characterize controllability , we aim to design a matrix @xmath35 such that the system is controllable and the number of independent control inputs , @xmath36 , is minimized .",
    "the minimum number of inputs , @xmath0 , serves as our measure of how difficult it is to control the system .    to find a robust and efficient algorithm to determine @xmath0",
    ", we rely on the framework of structural controllability  @xcite . we say that a matrix @xmath37 has the same structure as @xmath38 , if the zero / nonzero elements of @xmath38 and @xmath37 are in the same position , and only the value of the nonzero entries can be different , in other words , in the corresponding network the links connect the same nodes , only the link weights can differ . a linear system of eq .  ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) defined by matrices",
    "@xmath39 is structurally controllable if there exists matrices with the same structure @xmath40 such that the dynamics defined by @xmath40 are controllable according to the definition of kalman .",
    "note that ultimately we are interested in controllability and not structural controllability . yet",
    ", structural controllability is a useful tool because ( i )  if a linear system is structurally controllable , it is controllable for almost all link weight combinations  @xcite and ( ii )  determining structural controllability can be mapped to a graph combinatorial problem allowing for efficient and numerically robust algorithms .",
    "before addressing the minimum input problem of multiplex networks , we revisit the case of single - layer networks by providing an alternative explanation of the minimum input theorem of liu et al .",
    "this new approach readily lends itself to be extended to multiplex , multi - timescale networks . thus providing the basis for sec .",

    "the linear discrete - time dynamics associated to a single - layer weighted directed network @xmath41 are formulated as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath38 , @xmath35 and @xmath22 are defined similarly as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamics ] ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : singlenet]a ) . to obtain a graph combinatorial condition for structural controllability we rely on the dynamic graph @xmath44 , which represents the time evolution of a system from @xmath45 to @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "each node @xmath47 in @xmath41 is split into @xmath48 copies @xmath49 , each copy @xmath50 represents the state of node @xmath47 at time step @xmath51 .",
    "we add a directed link @xmath52 for @xmath53 if they are connected by a directed link @xmath54 in the original network , representing that the state of node @xmath55 at time @xmath56 depends on the state of its in - neighbours at the previous time step . to account for the controller , for each independent input we create @xmath57 nodes @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ; @xmath53 ) each representing a control signal ( i.e. the value of the @xmath60th input at time step @xmath51 ) .",
    "we draw a directed link @xmath61 for @xmath53 if @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is an element of matrix @xmath35 .",
    "according to theorem 15.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , a linear system @xmath64 is structurally controllable if and only if in the associated dynamic graph @xmath65 node sets @xmath66 ( green nodes in fig .  [ fig : singlenet]b ) and @xmath67 ( blue nodes ) are connected by @xmath68 disjoint paths ( red links ) , i.e. there exists a set of disjoint paths @xmath69 such that @xmath70 contains the set of starting points and @xmath71 is the set of endpoints .",
    "a path @xmath72 of length @xmath73 between node @xmath74 and @xmath75 is a sequence of @xmath73 consecutive links @xmath76 $ ] such that each node is traversed only once .",

    "two paths @xmath77 and @xmath78 are disjoint if no node is traversed by both @xmath77 and @xmath78 , a set of paths is disjoint if all paths in the set are pairwise disjoint .",
    "a possible interpretation of this result is that if a @xmath79 path has starting point @xmath80 and endpoint @xmath81 , we say that the signal @xmath82 is assigned to set @xmath83 , the state of node @xmath84 at time @xmath85 , through path @xmath79 .",
    "therefore we refer to path @xmath79 as a control path .",
    "the clear meaning of the dynamic graph and the control paths makes this condition useful to formulate proofs and to interpret results .",
    "however , it is rarely implemented to test controllability of large networks , because the size of the dynamical graph grows as @xmath86 , rendering such algorithms too slow . in the following ,",
    "we provide a condition that only requires the dynamic graph @xmath87 as input ; therefore it is more suitable for practical purposes .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that a linear system @xmath64 is structurally controllable if and only if ( i )  in @xmath87 we can connect nodes @xmath88 ( green nodes in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlenet]c ) and nodes @xmath89 ( blue nodes ) via @xmath68 disjoint paths ( red links ) and ( ii )  all nodes are accessible from the inputs . this result can be understood as a self - consistent version of the previous condition involving @xmath65 : instead of keeping track of the entire control paths as we previously did , we concentrate on a single time step .",
    "consider the dynamic graph @xmath87 representing the time evolution of the system from @xmath45 to @xmath90 , and assume that the system is controllable . by definition",
    "we can set the state of each node independently at @xmath45 ; therefore we can treat them as control signals to control the system at a later time step .",
    "now let us aim to control the system at @xmath90 , according to our previous condition , it is necessary that @xmath68 disjoint paths exist between nodes @xmath88 and nodes @xmath89 .",
    "this is exactly requirement ( i ) , together with the accessibility requirement ( ii ) it is a sufficient and necessary condition .",
    "note that @xmath91 is a bipartite network ( each link is connected to exactly one node in @xmath92 and one node in @xmath93 ) and each disjoint path in @xmath87 is a single link .",
    "the minimum input problem aims to identify the minimum number of inputs that guarantee controllability for a given network , in other words , the goal is to design a @xmath94 for a given @xmath38 such that @xmath36 is minimized . for this",
    "we consider the dynamic graph @xmath87 without nodes representing control signals .",
    "we then find a maximum cardinality matching , where a matching is a set of links that do not share an endpoint .",
    "the matching is a set of disjoint paths connecting node sets @xmath95 and @xmath93 .",
    "controllability requires @xmath68 disjoint paths between @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; therefore @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the size of the maximum matching ( if @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) . allowing the inputs to be connected to multiple nodes we can guarantee that all nodes are accessible from the inputs .",
    "thus we recovered the minimum input theorem of liu et al .",
    "@xcite .    in summary , by relying on a self - consistent condition for structural controllability",
    "we re - derived the known result that identifying @xmath0 is equivalent to finding a maximum matching in @xmath87 . in the next section",

    "we define the dynamic graph @xmath100 such that it captures the time evolution of a multiplex system defined by @xmath39 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamics ] ) from @xmath45 to @xmath101 . for sake of brevity , we assume that @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the case of @xmath104 and @xmath105 is treated similarly ( fig .  [ fig:3examples]d ) .",
    "each node @xmath106 in layer i is split into @xmath107 copies @xmath108 ; each node @xmath109 in layer ii is split into two copies @xmath110 , because layer ii does not update during the intermediate time steps .",

    "a linear two - layer system @xmath39 is structurally controllable only if there exists @xmath119 disjoint paths in the dynamic graph connecting node set @xmath120 and node set @xmath121 .",
    "in other words , a linear two - layer system @xmath39 is structurally controllable only if there exists @xmath119 disjoint paths in the dynamic graph connecting node set @xmath122 and node set @xmath121 .    to test whether the system is controllable by @xmath36 independent inputs , we need to find a @xmath123 such that the system is controllable .",
    "we do not have to check all possibilities , because if such @xmath35 exists , then the system is also controllable for @xmath124 where @xmath125 has no zero elements ; therefore , we only check the case when each input is connected to each node in layer i. given matrices @xmath126 , we now have to count the number of disjoint paths connecting @xmath92 and @xmath127 in the corresponding dynamic graph @xmath128 .",
    "we find these paths using maximum flow : we set the capacity of each link and each node to 1 , we then find the maximum flow connecting source node set @xmath92 to target node set @xmath127 using any maximum flow algorithm of choice .",
    "if the system is structurally controllable , the maximum flow equals to @xmath119 ; if it is less than @xmath119 , additional inputs are needed .",
    "we can now identify the minimum number of inputs @xmath0 by systematically scanning possible values of @xmath36 .",
    "a simple approach is to first set @xmath129 , and test if the system is controllable .",
    "if not , increase @xmath36 by one .",
    "repeat this until the smallest @xmath36 yielding full control is found .",
    "significant increase in speed is possible if we find the minimum value of @xmath36 using bisection .",
    "we initially know that @xmath130 .",
    "we set @xmath131 , and test if the system is controllable .",
    "if yes , we set @xmath132 ; if no , we set @xmath133 .",
    "we repeat this until @xmath134 , which provides @xmath0 . for implementation , we used google or - tools and igraph python packages  @xcite .",
    "the one - to - one coupling between layer i and layer ii guarantees that full control is possible with at most @xmath68 independent inputs ; therefore we often normalize @xmath0 by @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath135 .    note that in the above argument we rely on the test of structural controllability based on the dynamic graph , which was originally introduced for single - timescale networks  @xcite .",
    "the sufficiency of the condition relies on the fact that the zero is the only degenerate eigenvalue of a matrix @xmath38 if the nonzero elements of @xmath38 are uncorrelated .",
    "however , this might not remain true for the spectrum of @xmath136 , where @xmath137 , due to correlations arising in the nonzero elements of @xmath136 .",
    "if a @xmath138 eigenvalue has larger geometric multiplicity than the multiplicity of @xmath139 , @xmath0 would be larger than predicted by the dynamic graph ; if a @xmath138 eigenvalue has larger geometric multiplicity than @xmath140 but smaller than the multiplicity of zero , it does not affect @xmath0 , but may require connecting an input to multiple nodes  @xcite . in the @xmath141 and @xmath34 case , a control signal is only injected into layer ii every @xmath27 time step ( fig .  [ fig:3examples]d ) ; therefore , the spectrum of @xmath142 becomes relevant .",
    "however , we are interested in large and sparse complex networks whose spectra is dominated by the zero eigenvalue  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that the spectrum of @xmath136 will be dominated by zero eigenvalues as well . meaning that the minimum number of inputs is correctly given by this graph combinatorial condition .",
    "furthermore the one - to - one coupling between the layers guarantees that control is possible by only interacting with layer i directly .",
    "so far , we developed a method to characterize controllability of a multiplex , multi - timescale system based on the underlying network structure and the timescale of each of its layers .",
    "in the next section , we rely on these tools to systematic study how network characteristics and timescales affect @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we investigate how different timescales and the degree distribution of each layer affect controllability . for timescales ,",
    "we consider three scenarios : ( i ) the subsystems operate on the same timescale , i.e. @xmath30 ; ( ii ) layer i updates faster , i.e. @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; and ( iii ) layer ii updates faster @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "to uncover the effect of degree distribution , we consider layers with poisson ( er ) or scale - free ( sf ) degree distribution , the latter meaning that the distribution has a power - law tail .",
    "we generate scale - free layers using the static model  @xcite : we start with @xmath68 unconnected nodes .",
    "each node @xmath47 is assigned two hidden parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 , where @xmath145 .",
    "the weights are then shuffled to eliminate any correlations of the in- and out - degree of individual nodes and between layers .",
    "we then randomly place @xmath146 directed links by choosing the start- and endpoint of the link with probability proportional to @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively . for large @xmath68",
    "this yields the degree distribution @xmath149}{\\zeta_\\text{in / out}}\\frac{\\gamma(k-1/\\zeta_\\text{in / out},c[1-\\zeta_\\text{in / out}])}{\\gamma(k+1)},\\ ] ] where @xmath150 is equal to the average degree , and @xmath151 is the upper incomplete gamma function . for large @xmath152 , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the exponent characterizing the tail of the distribution .    to reduce the number of parameters we only study layers with symmetric degree distribution , e.g. @xmath155 ; however , the in- and out - degree of a specific node can be different .      in the special case",
    "when both layers operate on the same timescale , i.e. @xmath30 ( fig .  [ fig:3examples]b ) , there is no qualitative difference between the dynamics of the layers .",
    "the reason why the system can not be treated as a single large network is that we are only allowed to directly interact with layer i. recently iudice et al . developed methodology to identify @xmath0 if the control signals can only be connected to a subset of nodes  @xcite .",
    "however , the one - to - one coupling between the layers enables us to find @xmath0 using a simpler approach .",
    "finding @xmath0 for a single - layer network is equivalent to finding a maximum matching of the network  @xcite .",
    "a matching is a set of directed links that do not share starting or end points , and a node is unmatched if there is no link in the matching pointing at it .",
    "liu et al . showed that full control of a network is possible if each unmatched node is controlled directly by an independent input ; therefore @xmath0 is provided by the minimum number of unmatched nodes . to determine @xmath0 for a two - layer network , we first find a maximum matching of the combined network of layer i and layer ii .",
    "if there are no unmatched nodes in layer ii , we only have to interact with layer i ; therefore we are done .",
    "if a node @xmath156 is unmatched in layer ii , @xmath157 is necessarily matched by some node @xmath158 , otherwise the size of the matching could be increased by adding @xmath159 . by taking out the link @xmath160 from the matching and including @xmath161 the size of the maximum matching does not change , and we moved the unmatched node from layer ii to layer i. we repeat this for all unmatched nodes in layer ii .",
    "( note that it may be necessary to connect inputs to additional nodes so that all nodes are reached by the control signals .",
    "due to the one - to - one coupling between the layers this too can be accomplished by interacting only with layer i. ) this simplified method allows faster identification of @xmath0 using the hopcroft - karp algorithm  @xcite and analytically solving @xmath162 for random networks based on calculating the fraction of always matched nodes as described in appendix  [ app : sec : analytical ]  @xcite .",
    "first , we measure @xmath163 while fixing the average degree of layer ii ( @xmath164 ) and varying the average degree of layer i ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "for both er - er and sf - sf networks , we find that @xmath163 decreases for increasing values of @xmath165 and converges to @xmath166 , the normalized number of inputs needed to control layer ii in isolation  ( fig .  [ fig : seciiia]a ) . the latter observation is easily understood : @xmath163 is determined by the fraction of unmatched nodes in the combined network of the two layers ; if @xmath165 is high enough , layer i is perfectly matched ; therefore all unmatched nodes are in layer ii . based on the same argument",
    ", @xmath167 also serves as a lower bound for @xmath163 .",
    "varying both @xmath165 and @xmath164 for er - er and both @xmath168 and @xmath169 for sf - sf with constant average degrees @xmath170 , we find that dense networks require less inputs than sparse networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seciiia]b ) and degree heterogeneity makes control increasingly difficult ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seciiia]c )  in line with results for single - layer networks  @xcite .",
    "we also observe that @xmath163 is invariant to exchanging layer i and layer ii .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the size of the maximum matching is invariant to flipping the direction of all links , and on the ensemble level this is the same as swapping the two layers for networks with @xmath171 .    in summary , for no timescale separation controllability is equally affected by the network structure of both layers , and @xmath163 is greater or equal to the number of inputs necessary to control any of its layers in isolation .",
    "similarly to single - layer networks , networks with low average degree and high degree heterogeneity require more independent inputs than sparse homogeneous networks .      in the previous section we found that the network structure of the two layers equally affect @xmath163 if @xmath30 .",
    "this is not the case if the timescales are different , for example if layer i updates faster than layer ii , we expect that we need fewer inputs than in the same timescale case by the virtue of having more opportunity to interact with the faster system ( fig .  [ fig:3examples]b ) .",
    "in this section we systematically study this effect using the algorithm described in sec .",
    "[ sec : multiplex_net ] and analytical arguments .    by measuring @xmath163 for er - er and sf - sf networks as a function of @xmath28",
    ", we find that @xmath163 monotonically decreases with increasing @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seciiib]a ) , confirming our expectations . for both",
    "er - er and sf - sf networks @xmath172 converges to @xmath173 which is the normalized number of inputs needed to control layer i in isolation .",
    "this can be understood by the following argument : suppose that @xmath174 , the maximum number of time steps needed to impose control on any network with @xmath68 nodes  @xcite .",

    "we focused on two - layer multiplex networks , meaning that we assume one - to - one coupling between the nodes of the two layers .",
    "our motivation for this choice was to ensure analytical tractability and to isolate the specific role of timescales from the effect of more complex multilayer network structure .",
    "results obtained for more general multilayer networks will ultimately be shaped by a variety of features such as complex interconnectivity structure , correlations in network structure and details of dynamics .",
    "however , even by studying multiplex networks , we uncovered nontrivial phenomena , attesting that without understanding each individual effect , it is impossible to fully understand a system as a whole .",
    "using structural controllability we were able to solve the model , thereby directly linking controllability to a graph combinatorial problem .",
    "we investigated the effect of network structure and timescales by measuring the minimum number of independent inputs needed for control , @xmath0 .",
    "overall we found that dense networks with homogeneous degree distribution require less inputs than sparse heterogeneous networks , in line with previous results for single - layer networks  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath0 is completely determined by the faster layer and we do not have to take into account the multiplex structure of the system .",
    "this critical timescale separation is expected to be large if the faster layer would be easy to control and the slower layer would be hard to control in isolation . if we interact with the slower layer , control is increasingly difficult for increasing timescale difference , again up to a critical value , above which @xmath0 still depends on the structure of both layers . in this case",
    "the critical timescale difference largely depends on the longest control path that does not involve cycles in the faster layer .",
    "although our model offers only a stylized description of real systems , it is a tractable first step towards understanding the role of timescales in control of interconnected networks . by identifying the network characteristics that affect important measures of controllability , such as minimum number of inputs needed for control and critical timescale difference , our results serve as a starting point for future work that aims to relax some of the model s assumptions .",
    "some of these extensions are relatively straightforward using the tool set developed here , for example , the effect of higher order network structures can be studied by adding correlations to the underlying networks .",
    "other extensions are more challenging , e.g. if the interconnection between the layers is incomplete or the layers contain different number of nodes , the minimum input problem is computationally more difficult ; therefore investigating such systems would require development of efficient approximation schemes .",
    "structural control theory does not take the link weights into account ; therefore answering questions that depend on the specific strength of the connections require the development of different tools .",
