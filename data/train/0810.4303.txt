    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) has been succesful in explaining experimental data so far . however , the higgs sector of the model is experimentally unknown .",
    "this fact has lead many theorists to suggest that the sector could be non - minimal , and today it is common to study extensions of the sm scalar sector .",
    "the simplest extension is the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm)@xcite , which involves two scalar doublets in the process of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , there are five physical higgs particles : two charged higgs @xmath5 , two cp - even @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and one cp - odd @xmath2 .",
    "the charged particles @xmath5 are characteristic of the models with two higgs doublets and its discovery would be a clear signal of physics beyond the sm .",
    "+ a promising alternative for the search of new physics lies on the collisions of photons that will be present at ilc ( international linear collider ) .",
    "the ilc is the next greatest project to be developed after the lhc ( large hadron collider ) .",
    "the photons will be produced by compton retrodispersion , and earlier studies show that production of neutral scalars by photon collisions present a considerable probability of detection .",
    "besides , photons couple directly to charged particles , so @xmath8 high energy collisions could provide a better understanding of several aspects of the sm and its extensions@xcite .",
    "+ in this work we study the process @xmath4 in the frame of a general 2hdm .",
    "the first section presents a brief overview of the 2hdm , focusing in the third type ( 2hdm - iii ) .",
    "the next section contains the expressions used in the calculations .",
    "the third section contains the obtained results and finally the conclusions are drawn .",
    "the minimal extension of the higgs sector of the sm consists in adding a second scalar doublet with the same quantum numbers than the first one@xcite . we denote them by :    @xmath9    with hypercharge @xmath10 .",
    "both doublets acquire vacuum expectation values different from zero :    @xmath11    the most general gauge invariant lagrangian which couples both higgs fields with fermions is :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are non - diagonal mixing matrices @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are right - handed fermion singlets , @xmath18 are left - handed fermion doublets , and the index 0 indicates that the fields are not mass eigenstates . + in the most general case , both higgs doublets couple with the up and down sectors , and therefore they contribute simultaneously in the proccess of mass generation for quarks .",
    "this case leads to fcnc ( flavor changing neutral currents ) at tree level , because it is impossible to diagonalize simultaneously both matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this general case is known as 2hdm type iii .",
    "however , fcnc proccesses at tree level are highly supressed by the experiment . in order to avoid their existence , glashow and weinberg@xcite designed the following set of discrete symmetries :    @xmath21    the condition of invariance under this discrete symmetry leads to two cases :    * by using @xmath22 , matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 have to be eliminated from the lagrangian . in this case",
    "@xmath25 decouples in the yukawa sector and only @xmath26 gives masses to sectors up and down .",
    "this case is known as 2hdm type i. * by using @xmath27 , matrices @xmath23 and @xmath28 must be eliminated from the lagrangian . in this case",
    "@xmath25 couples to the down sector and @xmath26 gives masses to up sector .",
    "this case is known as 2hdm type ii .",
    "the 2hdm - iii is the only 2hdm that allows fcnc proccesses at tree level .",
    "precission tests of the sm model show a great aggreement with the fcnc parameters , except for the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation . besides , the fcnc processes do nt seem to violate any fundamental law .",
    "we study the 2hdm - iii because it has a more rich phenomenology , and it is possible to find the first two types as limit cases of this one .",
    "+ in the 2hdm - iii , a rotation of the scalar fields does not change the physical content of the model@xcite .",
    "this rotation can get rid of the vev of one doublet .",
    "if we take @xmath29 , it is found that @xmath30 .",
    "this is known as the * fundamental parameterization*. we denote the vev of the first doublet as @xmath31 .",
    "+ for a better study of the fcnc processes , cheng , sher and yuang ( csy ) propose an anzats for the yukawa matrices such that    @xmath32    this anzats obeys to the fact that couplings between fermions and the higgs particle in the sm are proportional to the mass of the fermion .",
    "parameters @xmath33 could change the hierarchy between fermionic couplings and because of this it is expected that they would be @xmath34",
    ". restrictions over parameters have been obtained in references @xcite .",
    "the most relevant are :    @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\ \\xi_{\\tau\\tau } & \\in&[-1.8 \\times 10^{-2 } ; 2.2 \\times 10^{-2}]\\nonumber\\\\ \\xi_{\\mu\\mu } & \\in & [ -0.12;0.12]\\nonumber\\\\ \\xi_{\\mu e } & \\in & [ -0.39;0.39]\\nonumber\\\\ \\l_{bb } & \\in & [ -6;6]\\nonumber\\\\ \\l_{tt } & \\in & [ -\\sqrt{8};\\sqrt{8}].\\label{restrictions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
