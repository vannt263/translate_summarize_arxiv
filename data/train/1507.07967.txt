    "one of the puzzling findings in the study of exoplanets has been the difference in the properties of planets orbiting cool and hot stars . in particular , using measurements of the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect , it has been inferred that the apparent obliquity @xmath4 ( the angle between the stellar spin and planet s orbital angular momentum vectors as projected on the sky ) is typically small ( @xmath5 ) for cool stars , but that stars of effective temperature @xmath6k exhibit a broad range of apparent obliquities , reaching all the way up to @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was further found that the masses @xmath8 of planets on apparent retrograde orbits ( @xmath9 ) are @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is jupiter s mass ; @xcite ) , and that the stellar rotation periods @xmath12 of cool stars that host a hot jupiter ( hj ) decrease with increasing @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "several models have been advanced to explain the obliquity dichotomy , but so far none can account for all the relevant observations .",
    "interpretations based solely on differences in the stellar properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can not address the inferred dependence of the obliquity on @xmath8 and the detection of highly misaligned planets around cool stars . in view of the fact that @xmath13k corresponds to the temperature",
    "above which the size of the outer convective zone of a main - sequence ( ms ) f  star shrinks rapidly , it was suggested that close - in planets in both cool and hot stars are initially distributed over the entire angular range ( @xmath14degrees ) , but that only in cool stars where a substantial convective envelope is present can a sufficiently massive close - in planet ( @xmath15 ) realign the star through tidal interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the host stars are also subject to magnetic braking , which declines strongly above the same transition temperature ( corresponding to the break in the kraft curve ; @xcite ) , and it was argued @xcite that this , rather than the tidal dissipation efficiency , is the main factor underlying the difference in obliquity properties between cool and hot stars . both variants of this scenario , however , face the conundrum that an hj undergoing equilibrium tidal interaction with its host star would spiral in and be ingested on a timescale that is comparable to the realignment time . a possible way out of this difficulty is to appeal to the \\{10 } component of the dynamical tide , which could in principle significantly reduce the alignment time without affecting the ingestion time @xcite .",
    "however , even though this model can be used to account for individual systems @xcite , it remains unclear whether it can explain the overall @xmath4 distribution of hjs and the manifested difference between cool and hot stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even the basic tidal interaction interpretation of the obliquity dichotomy has now been called into question by the results of @xcite , who analyzed the rotational photometric modulations of a large sample of _ kepler _ sources and inferred that ( 1 ) the conclusion that planets around cool stars are well aligned , and those around hot stars are not , is general and not restricted just to hjs ; and ( 2 ) the low obliquity of planets around cool stars extends to orbital periods @xmath16 that are a factor of @xmath17 larger than the maximum value ( @xmath18days ) for robust tidal interaction between an hj and a @xmath19gyr - old g or f  star .    in this letter",
    "we propose to address these apparent difficulties and account for many of the observed differences between the properties of planets in cool and hot stars by postulating that , in addition to the tidal interaction with existing close - in planets , a large fraction of the stellar hosts  both cool and hot  ingest a hot jupiter early on in their evolution .",
    "this proposal is motivated by the expectation that a large fraction ( up to @xmath20 according to @xcite ) of solar - type stars possess giant planets during their pre - ms phase , and that a large fraction of the giant planets that form in a protoplanetary disk on scales @xmath21au migrate close to their host star before the disk is dispersed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "numerical simulations incorporating an n - body code and a 1d @xmath22-viscosity disk model @xcite demonstrated that this behavior can be expected for disks with @xmath23 that are sufficiently massive .",
    "the inward planet migration is likely stopped by the strong ( @xmath24 kg ) protostellar magnetic field that truncates the disk at a radius ( @xmath25 ) of a few stellar radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gravitational interaction with the disk causes a planet reaching @xmath25 to penetrate into the magnetospheric cavity and , if it is massive enough , to undergo eccentricity excitation that can rapidly lead to a collision with the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it was , however , inferred that if @xmath8 is sufficiently small ( @xmath26 ) , the planet would remain stranded at a distance where its orbital period is @xmath27 of that at @xmath25 until well after the gas disk disappears ( on a timescale of @xmath28yr ) . in our proposed scenario , the primordial disk orientations span a broad angular range that is reflected in the orbital orientations of the stranded planets .",
    "when the latter are ingested by tidal interaction with the host star ( on a timescale @xmath29gyr ) , the absorbed angular momentum is sufficient to align a solar - mass star in that general direction , but not an ms star with @xmath30k .",
    "this is because cool stars have significantly lower angular momenta at the time of ingestion than hot stars as a result of a more efficient magnetic braking process and of a lower moment of inertia .",
    "given the proximity of the stranded hjs ( shjs ) to their host stars ( @xmath31days ) , they can be expected to have been ingested by the time their parent planetary systems are observed ; however , giant planets farther out can continue to interact with their host stars and potentially affect their measured obliquities . in our simplified formulation , we model the shjs using as parameters their characteristic mass @xmath32 and the fraction @xmath33 of systems that initially harbored an shj . by comparing the predictions of this model with the observational data ,",
    "we infer @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the potential effect of tidally induced ingestion of hjs on the observed properties of planetary systems has been recognized before .",
    "in particular , @xcite suggested that this process could account for the observed orbital distribution of close - in planets , whereas @xcite proposed that the spinup induced by the deposition of a swallowed planet s orbital angular momentum in the host s envelope can explain the observed dearth of close - in planets around fast - rotating stars .",
    "the current proposal further extends this scenario by incorporating not only the distribution of observed planets but also a putative population of hjs that were ingested after being stranded near the inner edges of their associated protoplanetary disks .",
    "using monte carlo simulations , we follow the temporal evolution of the stellar and orbital angular momenta of @xmath36 systems in the context of an equilibrium - tide model . the cartesian coordinate frame ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) is chosen so that the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath40 ) always points along the @xmath39 axis and the stellar one ( @xmath41 ) always lies in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane .",
    "we assume circular orbits and neglect the precession of @xmath40 and @xmath41 around the total angular momentum vector . axis and thus do not affect either the orbital separation or the alignment . ] the set of equations employed to model the tidal interaction between a star ( subscript  @xmath42 ) and a planet ( subscript p ) is : @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the orbital and stellar angular velocities , respectively ( related to the orbital and stellar rotation periods through @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 is the magnetic braking torque , and @xmath50 is the nominal tidal damping time , which , neglecting dissipation inside the planet , is given by @xmath51 in equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) , @xmath52 is the tidal quality factor ( taken to be a constant , for simplicity ) , @xmath53 is the semimajor axis , whereas @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote an object s radius and mass , respectively .",
    "we model the star as a uniformly rotating body ( @xmath56 ) with a moment of inertia @xmath57 , and adopt for @xmath58 the expression presented by @xcite , which covers both the saturated and the unsaturated regimes and incorporates as a key variable the convective turnover timescale as a function of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nominal magnetic braking time is @xmath61 .",
    "the equations are solved in a two - step process : we first integrate for a small @xmath62 employing a 4th - order runge - kutta method and then rotate the vectors so that the updated @xmath40 is along @xmath63 and the updated @xmath41 lies in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane . when considering a multiplanet system , we solve the equations for the different planets in sequence at each time step , neglecting possible interactions between them and assuming that their orbits remain coplanar .",

    "the effective value of @xmath52 and its physical basis are still open questions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the results for the final configurations of the modeled planetary systems are presented in identical formats in figures  [ fig : cool_stars ] and  [ fig : hot_stars ] for our representative g and f stars , respectively .",

    "these panels demonstrate that our model can account for the basic trends uncovered by the @xcite study  that planets around cool stars are well aligned with their host s spin irrespective of the planet s size or orbital period , but that planets around hot stars are not . to quantify the degree of alignment ,",
    "we follow @xcite and evaluate the ratio @xmath125 , where @xmath126 $ ] is the angle between the stellar rotation axis and the line of sight , the angle brackets denote an average over the distribution , and the normalization is by the value of @xmath127 for a random orientation of @xmath41 on the plane of the sky .",
    "this ratio is therefore @xmath75  when there is no preferred spin  orbit orientation ( as in our adopted initial condition ) , whereas it is @xmath128 when @xmath41 is normal to the line of sight ( which , in the case of a transiting planet , likely corresponds to @xmath129 ) . for our g - host model",
    "we obtain @xmath130 , which corresponds to having the @xmath3 of systems that ingested an shj attain good alignment even as the rest remain close to their initial random orientations . for the f - host systems we find @xmath131 , indicating that in this case the initial random distribution is only slightly modified .",
    "we note from figure  1 of @xcite that , while the median value of @xmath132 for stars with @xmath133k is consistent with perfect alignment , this ratio decreases toward @xmath75 in the g - star range ( @xmath134k ) that we have modeled . for their hot - star sample , a value that can not be explained in the context of our basic model . note in this connection that , as discussed by these authors , the observational challenges that need to be overcome in deriving the hot - star result are more severe than those encountered in the cool - star case . ]",
    "the bottom three panels of figures  [ fig : cool_stars ] and  [ fig : hot_stars ] confront our model predictions for hjs ( defined here by @xmath135 and @xmath136 ) with the observational data ( as of june 2015 ) obtained from ` exoplanets.org ` , which consist of @xmath137 entries for cool stars ( @xmath138 ) and @xmath139 entries for hot ones ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the left panel shows the planet counts as a function of @xmath4 , with the model predictions obtained by selecting @xmath141 samples from our simulations , each consisting of @xmath142 ( figure  [ fig : cool_stars ] ) or @xmath143 ( figure  [ fig : hot_stars ] ) systems , and plotting the average counts per bin ( bars ) as well as the range of @xmath144 standard deviation ( shaded areas ) .",
    "it is seen that the model is in excellent agreement with the data , with the only @xmath145 deviation exhibited by the bin encompassing @xmath146 .    .shj",
    "ingestion[tab : ingestion ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the key feature that enables our model to account for the aforementioned observations is the ingestion , over time intervals ( @xmath147 ) that are shorter than the ages of the observed systems , of shjs with values of @xmath148 that are @xmath149 for g stars and @xmath150 for f stars ( see table  [ tab : ingestion ] ) . the low obliquity attained by initially misaligned g stars at @xmath147 is due mainly to the efficient reduction of @xmath151 through magnetic braking over the time interval @xmath147 ; by contrast , @xmath152 for f stars .",
    "the strongest constraints on the parameters of the postulated shj population are provided by the observed @xmath4 distributions of hjs for the g- and f - star systems .",
    "in particular , by comparing the number counts of well - aligned hjs in solar - type stars ( corresponding to the first bin in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : cool_stars ] ) with those in the @xmath153 bins , one infers @xmath35 : the value of this parameter can be expected to reflect both the formation rate and radial transport properties of hjs in protoplanetary disks and the fraction of systems in which disk truncation is either short - lived or inefficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the corresponding data for f stars ( lower left panel of figure  [ fig : hot_stars ] )",
    "in turn imply an upper bound ( @xmath154 ) on @xmath32 : if the shj mass were measurably larger , there would be significantly more aligned hjs detected in these systems .",
    "interestingly , this upper bound is consistent with the limit obtained in the shj formation scenario studied by @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the qualitative results of our model are not sensitive to the exact values of these ( or any of the other ) parameters .",
    "additional data would , however , be useful for better constraining these values",
    ".    the host stars also interact tidally with hjs that are still orbiting ( and thus remain observable ) , which typically have @xmath16 values of a few days .",
    "while the impact of this interaction is not as pronounced as that of ingestion , it can still affect the observed properties of these systems .",
    "this is illustrated in the middle and right bottom panels of figures  [ fig : cool_stars ] and  [ fig : hot_stars ] , which display , respectively , the dependence of @xmath4 and of the projected stellar angular velocity on the hj mass for a random selection of @xmath155  simulated systems .",
    "it was already recognized before that the tidal interaction scenario is consistent with the apparent dearth of massive planets with either retrograde orbits or high-@xmath12 hosts : with increasing @xmath8 was noted in the case of cool stars by @xcite ; however , as the data shown in figure  [ fig : hot_stars ] suggest , it also characterizes hot stars . ]",
    "this follows from the inverse dependence of @xmath50 ( equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) ) on @xmath8 , which implies that more massive hjs should be more efficient at realigning and spinning up their hosts .",
    "the displayed results demonstrate that our model also broadly reproduces these trends quantitatively , for both g and f stars .",
    "our interpretation of the good alignment inferred for long - period planets around cool stars @xcite relies on the orbital planes of the ingested shj and of any remaining distant planet having roughly the same orientation , which is consistent with the picture of giant planets forming in a nearly planar disk and migrating to the vicinity of the host star .",
    "however , this scenario is not consistent with interpretations of primordial misalignment in terms of either planet  planet scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or a kozai - lidov  type interaction with a misaligned companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as these mechanisms typically result in different orientations for the orbit of an hj and those of more distant planets .",
    "there have already been several proposals in the literature for forming protoplanetary disks that are misaligned with the protostellar spin axis , including a warping torque exerted by the stellar magnetic field @xcite ; a gravitational torque exerted by a misaligned companion @xcite , possibly amplified by a resonance between the disk - torquing frequency and the ( disk - driven ) stellar precession frequency @xcite ; a combination of the above two torques @xcite ; and accretion from a turbulent interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "however , these models have not yet been fully evaluated in light of the observed @xmath4 distribution of transiting planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and other observational constraints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we adopted a completely random distribution of obliquities for simplicity , but more data and improved modeling might be able to constrain @xmath156 in the context of this scenario .",
    "future steps toward refining our model could include taking account of stellar evolution and of the effect of dynamical tides , incorporating an inner boundary condition that represents the stellar magnetosphere into global models of planet formation and evolution to better predict the properties of shjs , and reconciling the shj formation picture with the observed distribution of lower - mass planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the clearest observational prediction of this model is the occurrence of highly misaligned hjs with @xmath157days around very young stars , but finding such objects could be rather challenging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is at present only one claimed detection of a short - period ( @xmath158days ) , jupiter - mass planet around a pre - ms ( @xmath159myr ) , low - mass star @xcite , and it has , in fact , been inferred to be highly misaligned ( @xmath160 ) ; however , the true nature of this object is still being debated ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) ."
