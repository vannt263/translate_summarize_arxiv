    "as the most luminous and best known massive star - forming region in the local group ( lg , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the tarantula nebula in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) offers us the unique opportunity to investigate the process of star formation ( sf ) in an environment that , in many ways ( such as metallicity , dust content , and star formation rate ) , resembles the extreme conditions of the early universe and distant star - forming regions . the star formation history ( sfh ) of tarantula s ionizing cluster ngc  2070 ( a.k.a .",
    "30  dor ) is complex .",
    "@xcite defined 30  dor as a two - stage starburst , in which the radiation from the compact core r136 has triggered a new generation of stars at a projected distance of @xmath2 ( corresponding to @xmath3 at the the distance of the lmc ) .",
    "the complexity of ngc  2070 is reflected also in its atypical luminosity profile , which shows a break at @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and a bump at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recent observations in the near ir with multiconjugate adaptive optics ( mad ) indicate that the innermost @xmath8 of the luminosity profile can be fitted with a single ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eff ) powerlaw , once the asymmetric shape of 30  dor is taken into account @xcite .    here",
    "we take advantage of the high spatial resolution and sensitivity of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board of the _ hubble _ space telescope ( hst ) to study the innermost @xmath9 of ngc  2070 . in particular , we use public uvis and ir channel observations ( p.i .",
    "oconnell , go-11360 ) to characterize the spatial distribution of its stellar populations .",
    "deep wfc3 observations of r136 , the core of ngc  2070 , were retrieved from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .",
    "the data - set consists of 6 broadband filters ( f336w , f438w , f555w , f814w , f110w , and f160w ) , ranging from the near - uv to the near - ir , and is described in detail in @xcite . the images were processed through the standard calibration pipeline calwf3 , using the most up - to - date calibration files .    positions and fluxes of the stars in the wfc3/uvis images were measured using img2xym_wfc3uv , while we used img2xym_wfc3ir to measure positions and fluxes in the wfc3/ir images .",
    "both codes were adapted from img2xym_wfi @xcite .",
    "the astrometry and photometry of wfc3/uvis data were corrected for pixel area variations and geometric distortion as in @xcite and @xcite , while for the wfc3/ir data we used the solutions from anderson et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "stars were detected independently in each filter .",
    "the wfc3 photometric catalogs were calibrated into the vegamag photometric system using the most up - to - date values of the zeropoints , available at the wfc3 webpage , and then combined into a single catalog .",
    "approximately 3000 stars with photometric errors smaller than @xmath10 mag were found in all six bands .",
    "fig .  [ 3cmds ] shows three color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the stars found in the region covered by the uvis observations for different combinations of the filters f336w , f438w , f555w , and f814w . in each plot , stars were selected to have photometric errors @xmath10 in both the plotted filters .",
    "padova isochrones ( dashed lines ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for main sequence ( ms ) and evolved stars , and pisa isochrones ( continuous lines ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars , are superimposed to guide the eye . in doing this",
    "we assumed a distance of 50 kpc @xcite , and a metallicity z=0.008 @xcite .",
    "isochrones are also corrected for reddening .",
    "inspection of these cmds shows that the stellar content is complex : the bright and blue upper - ms ( i.e. @xmath11 ; @xmath12 in panel c ) is composed of intermediate and high mass stars , but at redder colors ( i.e. @xmath13 in panel c ) the majority of the sources are pms stars in the mass range @xmath14 and ages @xmath15 .",
    "pisa isochrones show that pms stars become fainter and bluer with age , to the point that after @xmath16 they are indistinguishable from the low - mass ms ( @xmath17 ; @xmath18 in panel c ) .",
    "[ f : dens ] shows the stellar density distributions in the @xmath19 area around r136 in the filters f336w , f438w , f555w , f184w , and f160w . in each map",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath20 , and the density levels are the square root of the number of stars .",
    "the spatial distribution of the stars in the f336w , f438w , and f555w maps is remarkably similar , with the majority of the stars `` clustered '' at @xmath21 , which coincides with the center of 30  dor ( figs .",
    "[ fig4nolan ] and  [ f : zoom ] ) .",
    "the apparent decrease of star counts in the f814w and f160w maps where r136 is located is caused by the high crowding , since no completeness corrections were applied to the maps .    in each map",
    "the density contours are not spherical . on the contrary",
    "they show an arc that departs from r136 to the northeast .",
    "this feature is clearly visible in all the filters , from the uv to the near ir , making it unlikely that local high reddening can be at the origin of this structure .",
    "the low impact of variable reddening in the stellar counts is also shown by the ratio between the f160w and f555w isodensity maps ( fig .",
    "[ f : dens ]  lower - right panel ) .    in fig .",
    "[ f : cmds ] the ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) cmd of the stars found within @xmath24 from the center of r136 is compared to that of the stars found in a @xmath25 box centered on the northeast clump ( see also fig .  [",
    "f : zoom])s . in both plots ,",
    "most of the brighter stars ( @xmath26 ) trace a well defined blue ( @xmath27 ) upper - ms , while below this value the majority of the stars show the red colors typical of intermediate and low - mass ( @xmath28 ) pms stars .",
    "although the northeast clump is less then @xmath29 ( corresponding to a projected distance of @xmath30 ) away from r136 , the redder and broader upper - ms of r136 indicates that the two populations are affected by different dust extinction .",
    "isochrones fitting of the upper ms indicate that a@xmath31 is sufficient for the northeast clump , but for r136 a@xmath32 is more appropriate .",
    "the same values have been obtained by applying a procedure similar to that used in @xcite    it is commonly known that the steepness of the upper - ms and the paucity of massive stars makes it challenging to identify the ms turnoff ( to ) , and even harder to distinguish age differences of the order of few myr , in star clusters younger than @xmath33 using isochrone - fitting only . in such clusters",
    "a more robust age indicator is the luminosity of the turn - on ( ton ) , defined as the locus of the cmd where the pms stars join the ms @xcite .",
    "the age of a cluster can be defined as the time spent in the pms phase by its most massive pms star .",
    "the comparison between the cmds of the two components shows that pms stars in r136 are more than @xmath34 mag brighter compared to those found in the northeast clump .",
    "since r136 is affected by a higher reddening than the northeast clump , we conclude that pms stars in r136 are intrinsically brighter , and therefore that in r136 sf lasted for at least 1 myr more than in the northeast clump would imply that the northeast clump would be at @xmath35 , far beyond even the small magellanic cloud . ] .",
    "it is possible to see the northeast clump also in fig .",
    "11 of @xcite , where the spatial distribution of pms stars younger than 4 myr is compared to that of older objects with active mass accretion .",
    "we used deep hst / wfc3 uv , optical and near - ir observations of the core of 30  dor to study its stellar content . in all the filters we identified a dual structure that can not be attributed to dust extinction .",
    "a careful analysis of the stellar content of the clumps indicates that , while the northeast clump formed the majority of its stars between 2 and 5 myr ago , r136 started to form stars likely @xmath36 ago and was still active @xmath37 ago .",
    "in retrospect , there are substantial indications in the literature that the northeast clump comprises a distinct , more evolved entity .",
    "its two brightest members , r141 and r142 , are early b supergiants that must be older than the denizens of r136 itself @xcite .",
    "many of the fainter late - o / early - b stars , being evolved , are also subject to the same age argument @xcite . in an analysis of star formation in the 30  dor core based upon these observations , @xcite proposed three sequential events with mean ages less than 1.5  myr , 2.5  myr , and 5  myr ; their figure  9 shows that the first is strongly concentrated toward r136 , while the heaviest concentration of the intermediate and old objects coincides with the northeast clump .    the age difference between r136 and the northeast clump",
    "can also explain the , until now , puzzling presence of two wc stars in 30  dor , as these highly evolved objects are seldom found in giant hii regions .",
    "one of them , mk  33d , is located in an apparent multiple system at the inner edge of the northeast clump @xcite , while the northward tail on the northeast clump encompasses the multiple system r140 containing the other wc along with two wn s @xcite .",
    "finally , even the isolated m supergiant ir18 @xcite somewhat further to the ne , long considered a field interloper , could actually be associated with the older clump .",
    "positions of the mentioned stars with respect to the two sub - clusters are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : zoom ] .",
    "this is , of course , a complex three - dimensional region , and some earlier spectral types also appear in the predominantly older fields , particularly in the mk  33 system .",
    "the o2  if*/wn5 object mk  30 @xcite that lies adjacent to r142 along the ridge of the northeast clump could be associated with r136 ; but on the other hand , some such objects are also found in older young clusters ( e.g. , ts3 in ngc  2060 ; * ? ? ? * ) , possibly as a result of binary evolution . in summary ,",
    "the information presented here provides strong support for our completely independent recognition of a double system with an age offset between them in the core of 30  dor .",
    "characterizing the complex structure of massive star - forming regions such as ngc  2070 is important to understand the early stages of cluster formation .",
    "the age difference found between r136 and the northeast clump , as well as their morphology , may indicate that the core of ngc  2070 is the result of a recent or ongoing merger between two sub - clusters .",
    "interestingly from the analysis of the radial velocities of apparently single o stars , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* submitted ) found evidence for an internal rotation in ngc  2070 , that can be due to either a recent merger between the main core of ngc  2070 and a secondary cluster or by the agglomeration and clumpiness of the gas .",
    "the majority of the stars studied in @xcite coincides with r136 , but 5 sources coincide with the northeast clump .",
    "if the total mass of the system is @xmath38 @xcite then the velocity difference , assuming a distance @xmath39 , would be @xmath40 for a hyperbolic encounter ( i.e. 0 energy ) , and @xmath41 for a circular orbit .",
    "the maximum velocity difference reported by @xcite is @xmath42 . if r136 and the northeast clump are undergoing a merger , then either we are observing the interaction with a low inclination ( which would agree with the fact that we see the tidal tail on the plane of the sky ) , or the 2 systems are bound and are falling in with low velocity .",
    "a detailed analysis of the mass distribution in the two sub - clusters and a more sophisticated modeling of the two component interaction will be presented in two forthcoming papers ( sabbi et al . in prep ,",
    "gieles et al . in prep . )",
    "the presence of distinct components in a very young system is also consistent with recent studies of galactic giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) @xcite , which contradict the traditional paradigm that gmcs are gravitationally bound systems .",
    "@xcite suggested that gmcs can undergo a hierarchical gravitational collapse , with the collapse occurring on scales ranging from individual cores to the whole cloud . in this scenario , because of the turbulent fragmentation of a gmc , sf will not be spread over the whole gmc , but will be localized in gravitationally bound pockets of gas @xcite .",
    "star clusters will be the final products of the hierarchical merger of such smaller sub - structures @xcite .",
    "we finally note that in a recent paper , @xcite suggested that the cuspy density profile of r136 and the large number of massive runaway stars that seem to escape from this cluster are signatures of a post - core - collapse star cluster @xcite . considering the small age of r136",
    ", such an early core collapse would occur only if the cluster had an initial density of @xmath43 , which is considerably higher than the current estimates .",
    "@xcite suggest that an efficient way to speed up the collapse process is to invoke the hierarchical merging of several smaller clusters .",
    "observational evidence for a hierarchical process of sf comes also from the complex structure of massive star - forming regions such as ngc  604 in m33 @xcite , or ngc  346 in the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite suggested that the elongation and mass segregation found in westerlund  1 may be the footprint of a merger of multiple sub - clusters , formed almost coevally in the parental gmc .",
    "if massive star clusters form from mergers of smaller sub - systems , this can also explain the high fraction of rotating globular clusters found in our galaxy .",
    "a study of the radial velocities and/or proper motions of the stars in the two clumps would provide a further test of the merging scenario .",
    "such datasets are currently being obtained by us ( e.g. hnault - brunet et al .",
    "submitted ; lennon et al . in prep . ) .",
