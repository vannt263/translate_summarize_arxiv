    "since the prediction by andreev and parshin @xcite in 1978 , crystallization waves at the superfluid - solid @xmath0he interface have become a well - known phenomenon . at low temperatures the @xmath0he crystal in contact with its liquid phase can support weakly damped oscillations of the interface due to processes of crystallization and melting . from the dynamical point of view",
    "such weakly damped crystallization waves at the rough crystal surface are an immediate counterpart of the familiar gravitational - capillary waves at the interface between two normal liquids ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "to date , the crystallization wave phenomena in @xmath0he have extensively been studied for the rough state of crystal surfaces , but not much study has been made for the well - faceted and atomically smooth crystal surfaces which may have an infinitely large surface stiffness .",
    "the most distinctive feature of the smooth faceted surface from the rough one is the existence of nonanalytic cusplike behavior in the angle dependence for the surface tension , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the presence of singularity leads to qualitative distinctions in a number of the phenomena at the smooth faceted crystal surface , e.g. , amplitude dependence velocity of traveling waves @xcite , quantum fingering of the inverted liquid - crystal interface in the field of gravity @xcite , rayleigh - taylor instability with generation of crystallization waves @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we develop a theory on the spectrum of facet crystallization waves at the smooth faceted surface of a @xmath0he crystal in contact with its liquid phase .",
    "we consider a few possible types of facet crystallization waves and determine the dispersion relation between the frequency and the wave vector , perturbation wave amplitude and the number of the crystal facet steps per wavelength . for simplicity ,",
    "we discuss the basal plane of hexagonal @xmath0he crystal as an example of the crystal facet and disregard any anisotropy in the basal plane .",
    "let us assume that the crystal surface is parallel to the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane , with vertical position at @xmath3 . in order to derive the oscillation spectrum of a facet surface ,",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "let us call @xmath4 the displacement of the surface from its horizontal position @xmath3 . in the lack of energy dissipation",
    "the surface oscillations can be described by the action @xmath5\\ ] ] with the following lagrangian @xmath6=\\frac{\\rho _",
    "\\text{ef}}{2}\\!\\int\\ ! d^2r\\ , d^2r'\\,\\frac{\\dot{\\zeta}(t,\\,\\bm{r})\\dot{\\zeta}(t,\\,\\bm{r}')}{2\\pi    \\\\",

    "the first term in the lagrangian represents the kinetic energy of the interface having an effective density @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that both the liquid and the solid phases are incompressible . because of low temperature consideration we will also neglect the normal component density in the superfluid phase or , equivalently , difference between the superfluid density @xmath9 and the density of the liquid phase @xmath10 .",
    "then the effective interface density @xmath8 is given by @xmath11 and depends on the difference @xmath12 between the solid density @xmath13 and the liquid density @xmath10 .",
    "for our purposes , the exact magnitude of the effective density is inessential .",
    "the second and third terms in the lagrangian are the surface energy and potential energy of the interface in the field of gravity with acceleration @xmath14 .",
    "unlike the liquid - liquid interface , the surface tension @xmath15 for the crystal facet depends essentially on the direction of the normal @xmath16 to the interface . in our simple case",
    "this is a function of angle @xmath17 alone between the normal and the crystallographic [ 0001 ] or @xmath18-axis of the crystal hcp structure with the geometric relation @xmath19 .    for the crystal facet tilted by small angle @xmath17 from the basal plane ,",
    "the expansion of surface tension @xmath20 in series in @xmath21 starts as , e.g. , refs.@xcite , @xmath22 we do not write the next terms of expansion , e.g. , cubic one due to step - step interaction , since we assume to study only small bending of the crystal surface . the angular behavior has a nonanalytic cusplike behavior at @xmath23 due to @xmath24 representing a ratio of the linear facet step energy @xmath25 to the crystallographic interplane spacing . below the roughening transition temperature for the basal plane @xmath261.2",
    "k the facet step energy @xmath27 is positive and vanishes for temperatures @xmath28 .    to consider a traveling wave , e.g. , propagating to from the left to the right , we represent the interface perturbation as @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the phase velocity of the wave .",
    "then the action ( [ f01 ] ) can be written as    @xmath31    since the integration is performed over @xmath32 and @xmath33 within the infinite limits and the kernel in the kinetic term depends on difference @xmath34 alone , we can shift the argument in @xmath35 by @xmath36 .",
    "next , by integrating twice by parts , we arrive at    @xmath37    in what follows , we will study sufficiently small bending of the crystal surface with the sufficiently small displacements @xmath35 and small angles @xmath21 .",
    "involving inequality @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we take only first terms in the expansion of the surface energy @xmath40 next , we will choose the @xmath1-axis as a direction of the wave propagation @xmath41 and replace @xmath42 with @xmath1 in the spatial derivatives . finally , we arrive at    @xmath43-s[\\zeta = 0]=-\\int\\ ! dt\\bigg\\{\\,\\frac{\\rho _",

    "one should have @xmath52 .",
    "for an existence of nontrivial solutions , it is necessary to put @xmath53 .",

    "( [ f04 ] ) must satisfy the following condition @xmath61    as a result , the general solution for profile @xmath62 should represent a train of flat segments and half - sinusoids .",
    "the width of a half - sinusoid , which we denote @xmath63 , is governed by the magnitude of vector @xmath54 according to @xmath53 or @xmath64 and is equal to @xmath65 .",
    "the half - sinusoid , which connects two neighboring flat segments , can be regarded as a macroscopic facet step in contrast to elementary steps of an atomic scale .",
    "to illustrate , we give two examples of such facet crystallization waves with alternation of one or two various flat segments in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .     and kink of width @xmath63 . ]     each . ]",
    "it is obvious that the wavelength @xmath66 can not be less than a sum of two half - sinusoids @xmath67 .",
    "in other words , the wave number @xmath68 does not exceed vector @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "later , it will be seen that always @xmath70 .    besides the wavelength , the wave spectrum at the crystal facet will also be characterized by the number of flat segments and their amplitudes .",
    "the width of macroscopic crystal steps @xmath65 depends on a ratio of wave frequency @xmath71 to wave number @xmath72 and can be determined using relation @xmath73 provided @xmath74 , the width of half - sinusoids can be neglected in first approximations and the macroscopic facet steps can be treated as a kink of zero width .",
    "usually , this is a range of sufficiently high frequencies @xmath75 and small wave perturbation amplitudes @xmath76 .",

    "then minimize the action .",

    "here we consider another type of facet crystallization waves with an arbitrary number of crystal facet steps per wavelength @xmath66 .",
    "the wave amplitude @xmath35 is assumed to be sufficiently small in order to neglect the regular surface @xmath94 and gravitational @xmath95 terms .",
    "this limit corresponds to high frequencies @xmath111 and zero width of the kink between two flat segments .",
    "thus , the profile of the perturbed crystal surface represents a broken line consisting of vertical steps and horizontal segments . for the definiteness",

    "this is not , of course , solely possible structure with @xmath123 crystal steps .",

    ", the smaller the perturbation amplitude @xmath150 , the larger the number of possible crystal steps .",
    "on the whole , the frequency of crystallization waves at a smooth crystal facet proves to be dependent not only on the wavelength , but also on the wave amplitude and the number of crystal facet steps which can be placed within the wavelength . from the experimental point of view",
    "this means that the excitation of crystallization waves with a fixed frequency will result in exciting some train of waves with different wavelengths , amplitude , and the number of crystal facet steps . in this connection",
    "the shape of the perturbed crystal facet will resemble rather an irregular and ill - defined profile with some elements of irregular - like character .",
    "a weak dependence of the wave frequency on the number of steps facilitates such phenomenon . in some sense",
    "one might say about transition to a rough state of the surface and destruction of the crystal faceting @xcite .",
    "the crystallization waves at the smooth crystal facets are expected to demonstrate a more varied and complicated picture than that at the rough crystal surfaces .",
    "the plane crystallization wave represents an alternation of flat crystal facets linked via macroscopic crystal steps with the width dependent on the wave velocity .",
    "most striking phenomena should appear in the limit of sufficiently small perturbation amplitudes .",
    "the frequency spectrum of facet waves depends significantly on the perturbation amplitude .",
    "the dependence on the structure of wave perturbation and the number of crystal facet steps is not so drastic .",
    "excitation of waves at a given frequency should produce a train consisting of waves differing in wavelength , structure and the number of facet steps and interacting nonlinearly with each other .",
    "this all is in contrast to harmonic waves which exist at the rough crystal surfaces and have the lower frequencies at the same wavelengths .",
    "evidently , the distinction results from a singularity in the angular behavior of the surface tension for the smooth crystal facets .",
    "let us estimate typical frequencies for the short wavelength range @xmath151 6  mm .",
    "taking @xmath152 2  mg/@xmath153 , @xmath154 0.014  erg/@xmath155 and @xmath156 0.160.18  erg/@xmath155 , e.g. , @xcite for the ( 0001 ) @xmath0he facet , we have the frequency @xmath157 10  khz and velocity @xmath158 2  m / s for the wavelength @xmath159 1 mm and perturbation amplitude @xmath160 1  @xmath161 m . in this case one",
    "may expect the maximum number of possible steps over wavelength to @xmath162 100 .",
    "if the perturbation amplitude for the same @xmath66 approaches @xmath160 0.1  mm , only one or two steps become possible .",
    "the wave frequency reduces to about @xmath157 2  khz which insignificantly exceeds the magnitude at the rough surface .",
    "note that , for the perturbation amplitude of a crystal lattice spacing in height , the propagation velocity @xmath101 reaches the magnitudes of @xmath162100  m / s comparable with the sound velocity .    in principle , one can find a few casual mentions about phenomena similar to the formation of crystallization waves at the crystal @xmath0he facets under heavy shake of an experimental cell @xcite or in the process of anomalously fast growth of a @xmath0he crystal under high overpressures @xcite .",
    "more convincing observation in favor of an existence of progressive facet waves has recently been found @xcite at the crystal ( 001 ) facet in @xmath163he .",
    "apparently , one of complicating factors in exciting and studying facet crystallization waves may be associated with the threshold character for most of phenomena occurring at the smooth crystal facets . in particular",
    ", it may require a sufficiently large size of the facet and sufficiently high amplitudes of driving perturbation .",
    "in this connection it may be helpful to employ the conditions close to an onset of some instability , e.g. , electrocapillary one in an electric field across the interface@xcite , rayleigh - taylor @xcite or faraday instabilities @xcite .",
