    "the @xmath4 cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) hierarchical paradigm is the best model we have to explain the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite . in recent years , it has proved to successfully reproduce a number of observational measurements ( e.g. spatial and colour - magnitude distributions ) for galaxies observed in the local universe and at higher redshift ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . in spite of the encouraging progress on the large scale , at galactic and subgalactic scales ,",
    "the success of the model has not been convincingly demonstrated as yet , and a number of issues remain subject of a lively debate in the astronomical community .",
    "examples of these are the core ",
    "cusp issue @xcite , the missing satellites problem @xcite , the angular momentum problem @xcite , or the downsizing  specific star formation rate relation for dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "another powerful test for the @xmath4cdm scenario at subgalactic scales , may be provided by galaxy halos , in particular by the milky way ( mw ) stellar halo .",
    "if the galaxy was assembled in a hierarchical way , there must be fossil signatures in the phase space distribution of halo stars and also in the galactic disc , although kinematic features in the latter may have multiple origins @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the origin and structure of the stellar halo have been studied by several authors using a variety of techniques ( for a review , see helmi 2008 ) .",
    "these include cosmological numerical simulations with and without baryonic physics @xcite and phenomenological modelling of the evolution of baryons inside haloes , usually in combination with n - body simulations that provide the dynamical history of the system @xcite .",
    "historically , chemical and kinematic information was used as a basis to formulate the first galaxy formation models . in their classical paper , @xcite suggested a rapid radial collapse that later continued to form the stellar disc . about a decade later , @xcite formulated the hypothesis that the stellar halo formed over a longer time - scale , through the agglomeration of many subgalactic ` fragments ' that may be similar to the surviving dwarf spheroidal galaxies observed today as satellites of the milky way . the @xcite scenario and several observational results are in qualitative agreement with expectations from the @xmath4cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , the observed abundance pattern @xcite seems to exclude the possibility that a significant contribution to the stellar halo comes from disrupted satellites similar to the present - day dsphs @xcite .    over the next decade ,",
    "a number of astrometric and spectroscopic surveys will provide accurate spatial , kinematic and chemical information for a large number of stars e.g. the gaia satellite @xcite ; the radial velocity experiment - rave @xcite and the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration- segue @xcite .",
    "this vast fossil records will provide important advances in our understanding of the sequence of events which led to the formation of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is critical to design efficient strategies in order to extract valuable dynamical information from the plethora of upcoming observations .",
    "the task is not a trivial one .",
    "it is not clear which is the optimal strategy , or in which space substructure can be best located .",
    "natural diagnostics like integrals of motion variables may be hampered by the finite accuracy of surveys @xcite .",
    "recently , action - angle variables have shown to provide a promising avenue @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed the usefulness of chemical information in identifying the relics of merger events .    in the present work we continue the study initiated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b05 ) , to revisit the possibilities of extracting reliable information about past merger events in the halo of our galaxy in the upcoming gaia database . in the previous study , we developed the numerical machinery to build ` mock ' gaia catalogues that include merger events from @xmath5body simulations against a realistic smooth galactic background .",
    "spatial , velocity and photometric information from a galaxy model with three separate components ( bulge , disc and halo ) was used .",
    "sampling issues were tackled , like the variation in probing depth of the satellite stellar luminosity function , as a function of position along a tidal streamer .",
    "a realistic model for gaia errors was included too . with the resulting catalogue ,",
    "a re  examination of the integral  space method of @xcite was done and it was concluded that , although promising , in real practice observational errors and the presence of an overwhelming galatic background can compromise the efficiency of this method and great care in its use must be exercised .",
    "it is clear that we must use as many search techniques as possible , preferably those that include as much observationally available information as possible .    following this path ,",
    "we have decided to investigate now the ` great circle cell count ' ( gc3 ) method proposed by @xcite , in order to find a way to increase its efficiency .",
    "we propose an extension to this method , that we dubbed mgc3 ( ` modified gc3 ' ) , which adds kinematical information to the original method , in order to detect substructures in the mw stellar halo .",
    "we have used the mock gaia catalogue of b05 , with the further improvement of a more detailed modeling of the simulated photometry of the satellites , so they now reflect specific histories of star formation .",
    "the expected gaia measurement errors were simulated as a function of magnitude , colour , and sky position of the stars , as described in appendix a of b05 .",
    "the values of the expected errors were updated to the latest predictions of the scientific performance of gaia .",
    "the latter can be found at http://www.rssd.esa.int/gaia under the ` science performance ' entry .",
    "compared to the performance predictions used in b05 the current astrometric error estimates are larger by a factor of two .",
    "we specifically asses the effect of the predicted gaia observational errors on the ability of gc3/mgc3 strategies to find simulated satellite remnants .",
    "we also study the effects on recovery efficiency when varying the orbit , luminosity and star formation history of the satellites .    in section  [ s : gc3 ]",
    ", we present a brief outlook on the problem of identifying past merger events and review the original gc3 method .",
    "some specific examples are shown to illustrate how it works . in section  [ s : mgc3 ]",
    "the mgc3 extension is introduced .",
    "the basic concept , as well as a practical way to implement it , are discussed . in section  [ s : appl ] , we evaluate the applicability of the mgc3 method using the mock catalogue of b05 .",
    "we also describe the way in which we have included various star formation histories for the satellites using and adaptation of the stellar population synthesis software of @xcite . in section  [ s :",
    "detectability ] , we study in detail the efficiency of the mcg3 method in identifying past merger events , as a function of satellite orbit , luminosity and star formation history .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "current computer capabilities allow us to explore the formation and evolution of stellar streams under a variety of conditions , such as different orbits and underlying potentials , via n - body simulations .",
    "the understanding of common properties of stellar streams , as well as their time evolution , are key to develop effective identification techniques .",
    "this goes hand in hand with the observational developments that will allow the practical application of such techniques to real data .",
    "key properties that determine the dynamical structure and evolution of stellar streams , which in turn can be used in their identification , are the integrals of motion : the total energy @xmath6 , if the galatic potential is stationary ; the total angular momentum @xmath7 , if the potential has spherical symmetry ; and its projection @xmath8 , if the potential has axial symmetry .",
    "the existence of these conserved quantities leads naturally to the search of streams as entities in integrals of motion space , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "this technique requires the computation of the conserved quatities in terms of observed ones , like @xmath9 , the galactic latitude and longitude , parallax , radial velocity and proper motions , respectively .",
    "these computations involve non - linear transformations resulting also in non - linear error propagation which , as b05 show , lead to systematic errors in @xmath10 as their expectation values do not equal their true values once the observational errors are introduced .",
    "furthermore , the spread of errors is greatly magnified , as shown there .",
    "additionally , the computation of the total energy @xmath6 requires an assumption about the underlying potential , which is an unknown and thus introduces another source of error .",
    "it is clear that , although powerful in theory , the integrals of motion technique has its limitations when applied to real data .",
    "it is thus convenient to look for additional search techniques that may complement it .",
    "a different approach in the identification of tidal streams is the gc3 method proposed by @xcite , which uses the conservation of the total angular momentum in a geometrical way .",
    "it relies on the fact that the orbits of stars in a stream in a spherical potential will be confined to a plane that contains the potential center .",
    "as seen from the galactic center , this plane is a great circle on the sky . in the more general case of an axisymmetric galactic potential ,",
    "the orbital plane precesses around the axis of symmetry of the system .",
    "this will result in the stream being approximately confined to a plane with a finite thickness , which in turn corresponds to a great circle of finite width .",
    "a further complication arises from the fact that we are not at the galactic center , which spoils to some degree the great circle effect , particularly for streamers whose orbits lie within , or near the sun s orbit .",
    "the practical implementation of the gc3 method begins by laying down a grid on the celestial sphere .",
    "each grid point is then associated to a unit vector @xmath11 ( pole vector ) that points from the observer to the grid point .",
    "all stars on the sky that lie on a band defined by the great circle in the plane orthogonal to the pole vector , are associated to this pole or grid point , the angular width of the band being specified independently .",
    "the number of stars within this band are assigned to the corresponding pole .",
    "the counts associated to every grid point in the mesh thus define a _",
    "pole count map_. significant maxima in this pole count map are then accepted as possible streamers . because of the geometry , the pole vector will be parallel to the angular momentum of all stars in the band whose velocity vector also lies in the orbital plane defined by the great circle .",
    "this latter property will be exploited later on , when we introduce the extended gc3 method .",
    "@xmath12 is a unit vector pointing to the star and @xmath13 is the tolerance which allows for the width @xmath14 of each great circle associated to a cell ( see sec .",
    "3.1 and fig . 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the distribution of pole counts is then represented in a map of the celestial sphere .",
    "we illustrate the pole count maps for two simple _ simulated _ stellar distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple_gc3]a - d , in order to explain their morphology . the spatial distribution of @xmath15 stars in a circular orbit with a @xmath16 inclination is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple_gc3]a and the corresponding pole count map in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple_gc3]b .",
    "this shows how the signature in a pole count map , of stars in a planar orbit , corresponds to a localized peak which coincides with the direction of the normal vector defining the orbital plane .",
    "since two antiparallel pole vectors define the same plane or great circle in the celestial sphere , the information on one hemisphere of a pole count map is replicated on the other ; hence the two peaks at exactly opposite directions in fig.[fig : simple_gc3]b .",
    "figure [ fig : simple_gc3]c shows a map of stars in a localized stellar distribution , with the corresponding pole count map in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple_gc3]d .",
    "the maxima in pole counts are in this case distributed along a great circle .",
    "this happens because all the possible planes which contain both , the localized distribution of stars and the observer at the galactic center , have poles which are in turn contained in a specific plane , of which the projection on the sky is the great circle seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple_gc3]d .",
    "in the gc3 method it is expected that the stars in the galactic background will contribute a smooth distribution across the entire map , modulated only by the stellar density dependence on position in the sky .",
    "the stars in a stream , on the other hand , will contribute only to the cells which coincide best with the stream s orbital plane , creating a local maximum in the pole count distribution .",
    "the gc3 method was used on a c - star survey by @xcite in order to quantify the statistical significance of a great circle c - star overdensity and to identify it as part of the tidal stream from the sagittarius ( sgr ) dsph galaxy .",
    "later , it was used on 2mass m - giants by @xcite , on a search for tidal debris in the galactic halo .",
    "they succesfully recovered the sgr stream but failed to indentify any other significant features .    in the following subsections",
    "we explore the performance of the original gc3 method by applying it to a simulated , or mock gaia catalogue ( b05 ) .",
    "the catalogue includes observational uncertainties and a realistic number of stars in the galactic background .",
    "it illustrates the need to modify the original method in order to reduce the contribution of the galactic background , and increase its sensitivity to detect lower luminosity tidal streams .",
    "the galactic catalogue from b05 constitutes a random realization of kinematic properties of milky way stars in the galactic disc , bulge and halo , with their corresponding density , velocity , age and color distributions , as well as the appropriate normalization in total luminosity .",
    "this resulted in a mock gaia catalogue containing @xmath17 _ observable _ milky way stars with full phase - space information and observational errors as are expected from gaia , as well as the error - free quantities for comparison .",
    "the two most important aspects to be emphasized about the mock catalogue are the realistic simulation of both the observational errors and the total number of stars that will be observable with gaia , which will be key issues in determining the applicability of any stream searching method .",
    "we restricted the catalogue to stars with @xmath18 , in order to avoid the galactic plane .",
    "the tolerance used in ( [ rcriterion ] ) was @xmath19 which corresponds to the half - width of each great circle cell and the gc3 pole counts were computed on a @xmath20 cell grid , uniformly spaced on the surface of the celestial sphere .",
    "we chose the tolerance to be slightly less than the @xmath21 half - width which @xcite find to maximize the signal to noise ratio of the sgr tidal stream feature in their 2mass m - giant pole count maps .",
    "we computed the pole counts for the error - free mock gaia catalogue , using the gc3 method s position criterion expressed in ( [ rcriterion ] ) in a galactocentric reference frame , i.e. position vectors and pole coordinates are galactocentric , the latter corresponding to normal vectors of planes that go through the galactic center .",
    "the resulting pole count map is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc3_gal_true ] . in this reference frame",
    "we name the longitude and latitude angles @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , with the galactic plane at @xmath24 , the north galactic pole at @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the direction away from the sun .        in this reference frame",
    "the pole count map would be expected to be uniform in @xmath22 and with a positive gradient in @xmath23 ( minimum at the equator ) , because of the axial symmetry of the galaxy about the galactic center and the latitude dependence in star density .",
    "however , the pole count map shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc3_gal_true ] clearly does not follow this pattern in @xmath22 .",
    "this is due to both the exclusion criterion in galactic latitude ( @xmath18 ) and the fact we are considering only stars which will be _ observable _ by gaia ; both criteria being inherently heliocentric .",
    "first , the exclusion criterion imposed on the heliocentric galactic latitude does not filter stars in the galactic plane near the sun at high latitudes , these stars contribute to pole counts for poles in the redish circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc3_gal_true ] , with their maximum contribution being for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , planes with @xmath29 do not contain solar neighbourghood stars and thus include stars at heliocentric distances that are larger on average than for planes that do go through the sun with @xmath30 ( this is illustrated for @xmath31 and @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc3_planes ] ) .",
    "therefore the number of observable stars that contribute to poles @xmath32 will be larger than in the perpendicular direction .",
    "these two effects reinforce one another and give rise to the morphology of the pole count map of fig .",
    "[ fig : gc3_gal_true ] .     as indicated by the color bar .",
    "_ top : _ x - z projection .",
    "the grey shaded area shows the plane with pole @xmath33 and @xmath24 , which does not contain solar neighborhood stars . _",
    "bottom : _ y - z projection .",
    "the grey shaded area shows the plane with pole @xmath34 and @xmath24 .",
    "this plane contains solar neighborhood stars . also , as shown by the color scale , the heliocentric distances of stars in the shaded area of the top panel are on average larger than those in the shaded area in the bottom panel .",
    "these effects give rise to the morphology noted on fig .",
    "[ fig : gc3_gal_true ] ( see text for details).,width=317 ]    the gc3 method s capability for detecting tidal streams clearly depends on how large is the contribution of the stream with respect to the galactic background . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gc3_gal_true ] , the mode of pole counts is @xmath35 stars / pole , which is a measure of the typical contribution of galactic stars in this error - free map . on the other hand , a dwarf galaxy with a stellar population similar to the galactic halo ( i.e. an age of 13.6 gyr and iron abundance @xmath36=-1.7 $ ] ) and total luminosity of @xmath37 l@xmath1 has @xmath38 stars brighter than @xmath39 , according to the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "the number of _ observable _ stars , however , will depend on the distance distribution of the stars in the stream , but will necesarily be smaller , specially since most of these are rather faint ( @xmath40 ) main - sequence stars . therefore , the signature of such a dwarf galaxy in a pole count map would be several times below the typical number of galactic background stars and thus very hard to detect .    as exhibited in this example , the number of galactic contaminants in a cell is an important limitation of the gc3 method . in the following section we propose a modification of the method , to help discriminate stream stars from the smooth halo using the main attribute of the original gc3 method , namely the use of angular momentum conservation through a geometrical approach .",
    "the gc3 method of johnston et al .",
    ", as explained above , uses solely positional information . in order to improve the ` signal ' of a stellar stream over the ` noise ' of the smooth background halo population",
    ", we propose the inclusion of velocity information as well .",
    "since the stellar stream is roughly confined to a plane that contains the center of symmetry of the potential , as seen from this center both its position and velocity vectors will be contained in the orbital plane .",
    "a grid of all the possible great circle cells is devised , with each cell uniquely determined by its _ pole _ , that is the unit vector @xmath41 which is perpendicular to the plane it defines .",
    "the modified gc3 ( mgc3 ) method proposed here for counting the number of stars associated with each pole , can be expressed in terms of the following galactocentric position and velocity criteria    @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unit vectors parallel to the star position and velocity vectors , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the tolerances which allow for the width of each great circle associated with a cell .",
    "the pole vector @xmath41 that corresponds to the cell which best coincides with a stream is parallel to the streams s total agular momentum .    as with the original gc3 , the mgc3 criteria in ( [ criteria ] ) will hold for tidal streams evolved in a spherical or slightly flattened potential .",
    "for the milky way ( mw ) , according to several authors , the orbit of the sgr tidal stream constrains the inner halo ( @xmath46kpc ) to be slightly flattened with a z - axis flattening @xmath47 for oblate models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and @xmath48 for prolate models @xcite ; albeit more recently @xcite find that a triaxial halo with @xmath48 and @xmath49 provides a better fit of the radial velocity and distance distribution of observed sgr stream stars .",
    "on the other hand , depending on dynamical age , orbital inclination and how close the stellar system comes to the galactic plane , the disc s potential can perturb the symmetry of the overall potential felt by the stream .",
    "@xcite classify stream morphologies resulting from their n - body simulations in three categories ` great circle ' , ` cloudy ' and ` mixed ' , illustrated in their fig .",
    "1 , as well as transition types in between these categories , as shown in their fig .",
    "2 . the mgc3 criteria proposed here will hold for the ` great circle ' streams , as well as for the dynamically younger parts of ` cloudy ' and ` cloudy - great - circle ' streams , and clearly not for ` mixed ' morphology streams .",
    "the position and velocity criteria proposed above , need to be written in terms of observable quantities .",
    "our first step is to write them using the galactocentric position and velocity vectors of each star :    @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the complements of the angles between @xmath41 and the vectors @xmath53 , and @xmath54 respectively , which correspond to the tolerance width of the great circle associated with the cell .    the vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 are in turn expressed in terms of the observable quantities @xmath9 as follows    @xmath55 \\\\",

    "the latter depend upon @xmath62 , though not on the parallax @xmath63 , when expresed in the cartesian galactocentric reference frame ( see appendix [ s : appendix ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ rgal_vgal ] ) , the expressions for the galactocentric position and velocity vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 depend upon the reciprocal of the parallax , which as discussed above , will introduce systematic errors in the determination of both vectors .",
    "therefore we define the vectors @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "with these definitions the parallax will enter multiplying instead of dividing ( see [ rgal_vgal_prime ] ) .",

    "this effectively lowers the pole counts on the whole map and also reduces the strength of the pattern of excess pole counts around @xmath30 because , as discussed in sec .",

    "this is caused by an oversubtraction of the background due to the excess itself , which increases the median value of the pole counts in pixels surrounding it in the smoothed image .",
    "also , spurious detections tend to arise at the @xmath90 level due to imperfections in the background subtraction . in the examples of following sections we consider _ bona fide _ excess detections as those corresponding to excess counts with amplitudes larger than @xmath91 .",
    "we also require @xmath92 , consistently with our avoidance zone of @xmath18 .    in the following section we systematically apply this procedure to recover the simulated streams from the detection of excesses in mgc3 pole count maps .",
    "in this section we explore the efficiency of the method in recovering simulated streams under different conditions of total luminosity , sfh and orbital parameters .",
    "the effect of increasing the total luminosity @xmath93 of a system is to increase the number of observable stars proportionally .",
    "the stream s signature increases with total luminosity , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_lum ] . for all five satellites , at an arbitrarily fixed dynamical age of 7.15 gyr , fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_lum ] shows the amplitude of the excesses recovered as a function of @xmath93 . the signal",
    "to noise ratio ( snr , understood as height of the peak over mean background , in terms of the background s @xmath87 ) of the stream increases with @xmath93 . for some satellites , i.e. s2 , the snr reaches a plateau since , depending on the shape of the stream , the pole count signature can differ from a localized peak if the stream is very disrupted ( see stream orbits in fig.4 of b05 ) . therefore increasing",
    "the luminosity can also increase the dispersion of pole counts in the background , maintaining the height approximately constant when expressed in terms of the background s standard deviation , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_lum ] .    figure [ fig : sigma_lum ] also shows the effect of varying the sfh , which in terms of the pole count maps is only reflected in a change in the fraction of observable stars . at the same total luminosity ,",
    "a sfh having young or intermediate - age bursts ( i.e. a carina - like sfh ) yields a larger fraction of brigther stars compared to a population with only an old burst ( i.e. an halo - like sfh ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_lum ] , were for most satellites at a given luminosity a stream is detected at a lower sigma level if the population is given by the halo - like sfh ( triangles ) than if it is given by a carina - like sfh ( circles ) .",
    "for very disrupted satellites like s2 and s5 , as mentioned before , the signature in pole count maps differs from a localized peak ; therefore the significance of the detection saturates earlier in luminosity for brighther populations causing the stream to be detected at higher sigma levels for fainter populations .",
    "finally , it can be seen that satellite s1 can be detected with the mgc3 method down to a luminosity as low as @xmath94 l@xmath1 , even for this old dynamical age of 7.15 gyr .",
    ".,width=317 ]      orbital parameters are clearly important since they determine the shape of the orbit .",
    "how disrupted the stream will become strongly depends on the perigalacticon and inclination angle .",
    "nevertheless , the most influential parameter affecting the detectability is rather the distribution of heliocentric distances of the stream stars at different dynamical ages , since this will determine the fraction of stars that will be observable in our simulated survey .    for all dynamical ages of the five satellite s streams",
    ", we computed @xmath95 the mean of the heliocentric distance distribution , as a measure of a representative heliocentric distance of the system .",
    "the plot of @xmath95 as a function of dynamical age in fig .",
    "[ fig : perihel_age ] , shows that as the dynamical age increases , stream stars can come closer to the sun as they are gradually distributed along the orbit , hence decreasing the mean of the distribution of @xmath95 .",
    "this effect would be enhanced by the action of dynamical friction which , although not included in the simulations , is expected to contribute in the evolution of real systems .",
    "therefore , the detectability of streams should increase with decreasing @xmath95 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_perihel ] , a plot of the @xmath87 detection level of the simulated satellite streams in pole count maps , as a function of @xmath95 , for satellites with a carina - type sfh and two different luminosities @xmath96 ( bottom ) and @xmath97 ( top ) .",
    "these plots show that old streams ( @xmath98 gyr ) at heliocentric distances up to @xmath99 kpc and @xmath100 kpc can be detected at a high sigma level , for the bright ( @xmath97 ) and faint satellites ( @xmath96 ) respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "streams can be detected at larger distances only if there s a dynamically younger and/or brighter population .",

    "this plot shows how all five satellites ( s1-s5 ) , which have stars observable by gaia ( and meeting our criteria @xmath104 per cent ) , can be recovered using mgc3 at different dynamical ages , for total luminosities in the range @xmath0 l@xmath1 with both sfhs and even down to @xmath3 l@xmath1 for satellites including a younger stellar population ( carina - type sfh ) for certain combinations of dynamical ages and orbital parameters .",
    "a statistical description of the efficiency of the mgc3 method would require a more thorough exploration of the orbital parameter space , but in the present experiments we have only 5 different orbital parameter sets . nevertheless , these experiments are usefull for a first rough exploration of the applicability of the mgc3 method in which , as shown in secs . [",
    "s : det_lsfh ] and [ s : det_orbparams ] , we find that satellites with total luminosities as faint as @xmath105 l@xmath1 , or as dynamically old as @xmath106 gyr , with different orbital parameters , can be recovered .",
    "furthermore , the experiments carried out illustrate a lower limit on the capabilities of the mgc3 method , since in our simulations we use _ only _ the information from trigonometric parallaxes to obtain the distances to stars .",
    "gaia , however , will also provide _ photometric _",
    "parallaxes for a much larger , fainter and more distant sample of stars , than those for which trigonometric parallaxes can be measured accurately .     of detectable satellites as a function of the heliocentric distance , for dynamical ages greater than 4.5 gyr , assuming a halo - type sfh ( _ bottom _ ) and a carina - type sfh ( _ top _ ) .",
    "the color scale represents dynamical age as shown by the color bar.,width=317 ]",
    "motivated by the desire to unravel the fossil record of the formation of our galaxy we have developed an extension of the gc3 method of @xcite in order to apply this to the search for satellite remnants in the galactic halo .",
    "the gc3 method is essentially a means of grouping together stars on the sky with the same orbital angular momentum , thus identifying stars along the same great circle .",
    "the original method suffers from a strong contaminating background in the pole count maps as demonstrated in section [ s : mgc3 ] .",
    "these background counts are due to the general galactic population of stars and can be much reduced by adding a kinematic criterion to the search for stars with similar orbital angular momenta .",
    "this constitutes the extended mgc3 method presented in this paper .",
    "we applied this new method to a mock gaia catalogue containing some @xmath107 stars that form the smooth galactic background and stars from simulated satellite galaxies on different orbits and with two types of star formation histories .",
    "the results show that the mgc3 method is capable of tracing remnants of satellites with luminosities down to @xmath108 l@xmath1 for dynamical ages up to @xmath109 gyr .",
    "remnants of brighter satellites ( @xmath110@xmath111 l@xmath1 ) can be recovered up to dynamical ages of @xmath112 gyr .",
    "the method works well for most satellites out to a heliocentric distance of @xmath113 kpc . at larger distances",
    "only the brightest and/or dynamically youngest satellites can be recovered .    like the original gc3 method",
    "our extended version is limited to recovering remnants of satellites of which the orbits are broadly confined to a plane .",
    "this makes this method well suited for probing the outer halo of our galaxy where the potential is more nearly spherical or axisymmetric and where dynamical timescales are long .",
    "the mgc3 method thus forms an important complement to the phase space structure characterization methods which will be used in the inner halo , where due to the short dynamical timescales phase space substructures are harder to detect . in these regions",
    "it will be mandatory to use very accurate measurements of integrals of motion employing methods such as those as proposed in @xcite and @xcite . in both cases only the use of the highest accuracy parallaxes ( relative errors better than about 10 per cent , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows the recovery of phase space substructure .",
    "in contrast the mgc3 method works with @xmath76 per cent accurate parallax data making it suitable for probing larger distances .",
    "the gaia mission is expected to map the immediate solar neighbourhood to very high accuracy resulting in some 10 million stars with distances known to better than a few per cent .",
    "this will enable a much more accurate calibration of other distance indicators , in particular photometric indicators , which can then be used to extend the mgc3 method also to large samples beyond 40 kpc .",
    "in addition the gaia mission will result in a first order smooth dynamical model of the milky way galaxy which can be used to construct an accurate map of the background mgc3 pole count map .",
    "subtracting a more accurate background map will further enhance the efficiency of the mgc3 method .",
    "we note here two lines of investigation that should be pursued to further investigate and enhance the mgc3 method .",
    "( i ) the efficiency of the mgc3 method should be explored more extensively by more widely sampling the satellite orbital parameter space .",
    "more precise limits on the orbital morphologies and dynamical ages , for which satellites remnants can still be recovered , can then be obtained . in addition , the simulation of the satellites could be made more sophisticated by following the suggestions made in the conclusions of b05 .",
    "( ii ) in connection with these studies it is interesting to investigate to what extent the requirement of single peaks in the pole count map for identifying remnants can be relaxed .",
    "this would enable us to account for the precession of the orbital angular momentum vector and thereby recover a larger fraction of the stellar population of a given disrupted satellite .",
    "a hint of this possibility can already be seen in the double peaked structure of the signature of the satellite s2 in the map presented in fig.[fig : polemap_s2 ] .",
    "finally , the mgc3 method is not perfect and will certainly pick up stars from the field population that appear to belong to a satellite because they are measured to have a compatible orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "these should be weeded out by making use of the fact that the different star formation histories for the different satellites will lead to different abundance patterns in their stellar populations .",
    "gross distinctions ( such as large overall metallicity differences ) can be made photometrically .",
    "however , eventually the stars identified as part of a potential satellite remnant should be targeted for detailed spectroscopic follow up in order to definitively ` tag ' the stars to their progenitor galaxy and obtain accurate information on the progenitor s time of accretion .",
    "we look forward the time ahead of us when , thanks to the gaia mission , complementary spectroscopic data , and efficient methods of characterizing substructure in phase space , we will enter the era of precision galactic archaeology .",
