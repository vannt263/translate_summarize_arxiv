    "the black hole information loss problem is one of the most important issues in modern physics .",
    "if there is information loss , it may imply the fundamental limitation of the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "thus , there is almost a consensus that accepts the conservation of information .",

    "one may guess that , from the first assumption , a local observer should reconstruct all bits of information .",
    "if we accept the second assumption , from the information theoretical consideration , one notices that some information should come out of a black hole even if the black hole is sufficiently large .",
    "_ even when a black hole is big , it should emit information by hawking radiation after the information retention time .",
    "_ however , we know that free - falling information will touch the singularity , and information should be located at the center of the black hole . then , the free - falling information is located at the center , and , at the same time",
    ", the information is located on the outside via the hawking radiation .",
    "of course , this is impossible according to the no cloning theorem .",
    "now , black hole complementarity says that this can happen if there is no witness of the violation of natural laws .",
    "if the free - falling information and the hawking radiation can not communicate forever , there will be essentially no problem .",
    "this can resolve the information loss paradox in a fascinating way .    as this author can safely assert ,",
    "black hole complementarity is a quite general consensus between string theorists .",
    "complementarity was a crucial step toward the speculation that produced the holographic principle .",
    "moreover , during the 1990s , some important techniques were developed to realize the holographic principle : the d - brane picture and ads / cft .",
    "if ads / cft is true , a black hole in anti de sitter space should be unitary .",
    "also , from the d - brane picture , we understand that the black hole area is proportional to the statistical entropy .",
    "then , because of some arguments from the information theory , black hole complementarity must be implemented in a black hole .",

    "regular means that there is no singularity . from the singularity theorem ,",
    "it is quite natural to think that there is a singularity inside a black hole .",
    "however , if one drops some of assumptions of the theorem , one may allow a regular black hole solution .",
    "in general , for static metrics , there is no singularity via the violation of causality conditions .",
    "moreover , even though a static metric holds the null energy condition , for a dynamical metric , it may violate all kinds of energy conditions via the hawking radiation .",
    "thus , the existence of regular space - time in realistic situations is not so strange .",
    "we will discuss frolov , markov , and mukhanov s model .",
    "this model assumes a local false vacuum .",
    "thus , the static metric holds the null energy condition . since we need to paste the false vacuum and the true vacuum , we need a transition layer by a mass shell .",
    "this condition could be calculated .",
    "the metric is @xmath3 where @xmath4 with mass @xmath5 .",
    "here , @xmath6 is the hubble scale parameter of the inside de sitter metric , and @xmath7 is the radius of the false vacuum boundary ( we can choose @xmath8 as a free parameter ) .",
    "note that the energy condition or the matter configuration is quite realistic , since one needs to assume just a false vacuum .",
    "also , since it uses the thin shell approximation , as long as the approximation is true , its causal structure does not depend on the details of the transition region .    to describe a dynamical case",
    ", we can use the vaidya metric .",
    "one can notice that this model has two horizons @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in general , this kind of model will approach the extreme limit , and approach a stable remnant with mass @xmath11 .",
    "however , if the false vacuum collapses to singularity before the extreme limit , it will form a schwarzschild black hole ; this assumption seems to be plausible in realistic situations . integrating these facts",
    ", we can draw the causal structure of the regular black hole model ( the left diagram of figure [ fig : penrose ] ; where @xmath0 is the maximum mass ) .",
    "the information retention time should be located between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the observer who falls into the black hole between the times will compare the hawking radiation with the free - falling information .",
    "thus a duplication experiment becomes possible .",
    "one potential problem is the inner horizon . because of the mass inflation",
    ", the inner horizon will be unstable in general , and it may form a curvature singularity . however , from some numerical work , we can conclude that we can qualitatively trust the causal structure .",

    "spherical symmetry is a useful assumption : @xmath19 , where we used the double - null coordinate ( our convention is @xmath20 $ ] ) .",
    "since the electromagnetic field is a gauge field , we can fix a gauge @xmath21 .",
    "then , these assumptions give the einstein tensor @xmath22 and the stress - energy tensor @xmath23 components , as well as equations of motion for the scalar field and the electromagnetic field . to describe the dynamical case",
    ", we needed to include the hawking radiation .",
    "for this purpose , we introduced the renormalized stress - energy tensor @xmath24 via the s - wave approximation from the 2-dimensional results ( which are divided by @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for a spherically symmetric case . because of spherical symmetry , assigning of initial conditions is not a difficult problem .",
    "we pushed a field configuration at the initial surface by choosing a proper function @xmath26 , where @xmath27 represents the initial retarded time .",
    "finally , we solve the einstein equation @xmath28 , as well as field equations for the scalar field and the gauge field .",
    "the right diagram of figure [ fig : penrose ] is the causal structure of a dynamical charged black hole .",
    "the meaning is clear .",
    "initially , there is a space - like singularity due to the mass - inflation .",
    "if there is no hawking radiation , there will be an inner horizon at @xmath29 , and the inner horizon will be a curvature singularity .",
    "however , because of the hawking radiation , the black hole will become closer to an extreme black hole : the outer horizon bends the time - like direction , and the inner horizon bends the space - like direction . because of the singularity , there is the cauchy horizon , which one can not determine from the initial data . and",
    ", there is enough distance between the inner horizon and the cauchy horizon .    from the calculation",
    ", we can notice that the mass function increases exponentially around the inner horizon : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the surface gravity of the inner horizon .",
    "however , as long as @xmath32 and @xmath33 are finite , the mass function or curvature functions are finite .",
    "thus , the inner horizon is regular in the general relativistic sense . of course ,",
    "if a curvature function becomes bigger than the planck scale , it will be a problem .",
    "however , in our scheme , _ the planck scale is not determined until we choose a number of massless fields _ : when one chooses @xmath34 , for one specific simulation , @xmath35 needs to be fixed as a constant , where @xmath36 is the number of massless fields . after determining @xmath37 or @xmath36",
    ", we could determine the planck scale .",
    "if we choose large @xmath36 , then it implies small @xmath37 , and the curvature cutoff becomes bigger and bigger , i.e. , via the re - scaling , physical curvatures become smaller and smaller .",
    "therefore , large @xmath36 will make entire solutions trustable in a semi - classical sense .",
    "now , we can do a semi - classical thought experiment with our causal structure .",
    "one can easily see that there is enough time to send a signal @xmath38 , and the observer can compare both the information of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "first , we did not include the pair - creation effects .",
    "thus , we needed to assume that pair - creation effects of electrons are not more dominant than the hawking radiation . of course",
    ", this can be justified if the mass of the black hole is sufficiently large . and also , if the charge is sufficiently large , the black hole tends to approach the extreme limit .",
    "of course , this assumption is not bad in a physical sense .",
    "second , we needed to regularize the region between the inner horizon and the cauchy horizon .",
    "this region has a large curvature in general .",
    "however , we noticed that the large number of massless fields will re - scale all values , and will make the entire region semi - classically convincible . and",
    ", as i noticed , the second condition is crucial for the regular black hole case .",
    "therefore , one of the author s conclusions is that , _ _ if one assumes a large number of massless fields , one allows the violation of black hole complementarity . _ _ , black hole complementarity can be violated . when we fix @xmath34 , by tuning @xmath40 , all mass , length , and time scales will be re - scaled by @xmath41 .",
    "then , @xmath42 should be re - scaled by @xmath43 , and from the uncertainty relation , the required energy will be on the order of @xmath44 . as a physical value ,",
    "@xmath45 is the consistency condition for complementarity .",
