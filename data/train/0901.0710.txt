    "in recent years dedicated searches and serendipitous discoveries have uncovered several optical transients with luminosities intermediate between the well - studied classes of nova eruptions ( @xmath7 mag ) and supernova ( sn ) explosions ( @xmath8 mag ) . as can be expected from the wide gap in luminosity , these intermediate luminosity optical transients ( hereafter , ilots )",
    "appear to be diverse in their properties and origins .",
    "some have been classified as low luminosity core - collapse sne , with inferred energies and @xmath9ni masses that are at least an order of magnitude below typical sn events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "others , sometimes initially classified as type iin sne , have been subsequently tagged with the catch - all designation of `` sn impostors '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that includes events resembling luminous blue variable ( lbv ) eruptions .",
    "finally , a small number of somewhat dimmer events have been recently grouped under the proposed name `` luminous red novae '' ( lrne ; @xcite ) , based on their red optical colors ; the origin of lrne and their relation to each other remain unclear .",
    "overall , the various groupings have been subject to debate , and there is no clear agreement about the nature of individual objects or the degree of overlap between the various designations .",
    "equally important , the connection between the different types of events and different classes of progenitors remains unclear .",
    "for example , some lbv eruptions have been initially classified as sne ( e.g. , sne 1961v and 1954j ; @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the progenitor of the recent event sn2008s , which was detected in archival _ spitzer space telescope _ images , has been argued to be an extreme agb star @xcite or an lbv @xcite .",
    "the nature of the event itself is also unclear , with claims of a low mass electron - capture sn @xcite and an lbv - like outburst @xcite .",
    "the recent event 85 , and the possibly related eruptive object v838 mon , have been speculated to possibly result from stellar mergers @xcite , but other possibilities have been proposed such as a low - luminosity sn for 85@xcite , and an agb pulse , nova eruption from an embedded common envelope white dwarf , or planet capture for v838 mon ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "regardless of the exact interpretation , it is clear that the various proposed eruption / explosion scenarios mark important phases in the evolution of massive stars , possibly on the path to diverse types of sne .",
    "therefore , a mapping between ilots and their progenitors will provide important constraints on the initial conditions ( i.e. , progenitors and circumstellar properties ) of sn explosions .",
    "the present uncertainty in this mapping highlights the need for detailed observations that can uncover the conditions both prior to and during the ilot events .",
    "these include the identification of progenitors , a detailed study of the circumstellar environment , and measurements of the event properties across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "such observations will also allow us to determine the connection between the various proposed categories of ilots , and to map the overall diversity of this seemingly heterogeneous class .",
    "in this paper we present such a combination of observations for an ilot discovered in the nearby galaxy ngc300 on 2008 april 24 ut ( hereafter , ) . for the first time for such an event , we combine multi - wavelength observations ( uv , optical , radio , and x - rays ) , high - resolution echelle spectroscopy , and archival _ hubble space telescope _ and _ spitzer space telescope _ data to show that was the result of an eruption from a @xmath10 m@xmath5 dust - obscured and relatively compact star , possibly in a binary system .",
    "our high - resolution spectra , the first for this event , resemble the yellow hypergiant star irc+10420 ( see also @xcite ) , suggesting that  may mark a transition to a similar evolutionary stage .",
    "a comparison to the recent events sn2008s and 85  shows that all three events may have originated from the same phenomenon , but with a scatter in the energy release and circumstellar properties , that may point to a range of progenitor masses .",
    "was discovered by @xcite on 2008 apr 24.16 ut in the outskirts of the nearby galaxy ngc300 ( @xmath11 mpc ; @xcite ) with an apparent brightness of 16.5 mag ( unfiltered ) .",
    "subsequent observations on may 14.14 ut revealed that the object had brightened to about 14.2 mag @xcite .",
    "was not detected in observations from 2008 apr 17.1 ut , but only to a limit of 15.5 mag .",
    "it was also not detected in deeper observations taken on 2007 dec 30.8 and 2008 feb 8.75 ut to limiting magnitudes of 18.5 and 18.0 mag , respectively @xcite .",
    "since the transient was brightening at the discovery epoch , we adopt an event start time that is consistent with the most recent non - detection , @xmath12 apr 17 ut but note that the actual start time may have occurred earlier .",
    "a low resolution spectrum of  obtained by @xcite on may 15.4 ut revealed emission lines corresponding to h@xmath13 , h@xmath14 , the ir triplet , and the [ ] @xmath15 doublet ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the marginally - resolved lines indicated velocities of @xmath16 km s@xmath2 , significantly lower than those of both classical novae and supernovae .",
    "following the announcement of the discovery and early spectroscopy , and given the unique opportunity to study a nearby ilot in detail , we initiated observations across the electromagnetic spectrum , particularly high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "in addition , we obtained archival _",
    "hubble space telescope _ and _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "observations at the position of the transient to search for a pre - discovery counterpart .      the original reported position of  was @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( j2000 ) , measured relative to the core of ngc300 @xcite . as part of our initial spectroscopic observations we obtained an @xmath19-band image of the field with the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-3 ) mounted on the magellan / clay 6.5-m telescope . using 13 objects in common with the naval observatory merged astrometric dataset ( nomad ) , we measure the actual position of the transient to be @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of about @xmath20 in each coordinate .",
    "this position is @xmath21 west and @xmath22 south of the iauc position .",

    "we obtained multiple low- and high - resolution optical spectra of  using ldss-3 and the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph mounted on the magellan / clay 6.5-m telescope . a log of the observations , including the spectral coverage and resolution is provided in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "the ldss-3 spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines , while rectification and sky subtraction were performed using the method and software described in @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using henear arc lamps , and air - to - vacuum and heliocentric corrections were applied .",

    "the mike spectra were reduced using a custom reduction pipeline written in python .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using thar arc lamps , and air - to - vacuum and heliocentric corrections were applied .",
    "we obtained optical photometric observations with ldss-3 in the @xmath23 filters on may 31.44 ut ; see table  [ tab : opt ] .",
    "the data were reduced using standard routines in iraf .",
    "photometry was performed relative to the standard star field e8-a .",
    "the resulting spectral energy distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : optsed ] .",
    "we obtained uv and optical observations with the _ swift _ uv / optical telescope spanning from 2008 may 20 to october 15 ; see table  [ tab : uvot ] . the data were processed using standard routines within the heasoft package .",
    "photometry of the transient in the uvw1 and @xmath24 images was performed using the standard @xmath25 aperture ; the source was not clearly detected in the uvw2 images .",
    "the light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : lcs ] , and the spectral energy distribution at the epoch of the ldss-3 observations is shown in figure  [ fig : optsed ] .",
    "simultaneous with the _",

    "a power law model with a photon index of @xmath31 leads to a similar limit of @xmath32 erg s@xmath2 @xmath28 .",

    "continued monitoring at frequencies between 4.86 and 22.5 ghz over the subsequent seven months revealed no radio emission , with the latest non - detection obtained on 2008 november 24 ut ( @xmath36 @xmath35jy at 8.46 ghz ) .",
    "the upper limits imply a radio luminosity @xmath37 erg s@xmath2 hz@xmath2 .",
    "this limit is at least two orders of magnitude below the least luminous radio sne ever observed ( type iip sne : @xcite ; type ibc sn2002ap @xcite ) .",
    "it is also two orders of magnitude below the detected emission from the `` sn impostor '' sn1961v @xcite .",
    "the uv / optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) on 2008 may 31 is shown in figure  [ fig : optsed ] . the data have been corrected for the low galactic extinction , @xmath38 mag @xcite .",
    "we find that the sed is well fit by a blackbody spectrum ( @xmath39 for 5 degrees of freedom ) with a temperature of @xmath40 k and a radius of @xmath41 cm .",
    "the best - fit value of the host galaxy extinction is @xmath42 mag , with a @xmath43 upper limit of @xmath44 mag .",
    "as we show below , the low intrinsic dust extinction is supported by our detection of weak interstellar d absorption lines at the redshift of ngc300 , from which we infer negligible line of sight extinction , @xmath45 mag .",
    "using an event start date of april 17 and assuming a constant expansion rate , the inferred velocity is about 600 km s@xmath2 , in good agreement with our measured velocity width of the h@xmath13 emission line , @xmath46 km s@xmath2 ( see  [ sec : lowspec ] ) .    the optical / uv `` bolometric '' luminosity of  on may 31 is @xmath47 erg s@xmath2 , or @xmath48 mag .",
    "this is about 4 magnitudes brighter than typical novae , and about @xmath49 mag fainter than sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the optical / uv emission fades slowly to @xmath50 d with a decline rate of about 0.02 mag d@xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) .",
    "however , observations at @xmath51 d reveal significant steepening relative to the early decay rate , indicating a break in the light curves at @xmath52 d ( detailed optical and near - ir light curves are presented in @xcite ) .",
    "we return to this point in  [ sec : comp ] .    using a roughly constant luminosity out to @xmath53 d , we find that the total radiated energy is about @xmath54 erg .",
    "therefore , the outflow kinetic energy is at least as large , indicating an ejected mass of @xmath55 m@xmath5 .",
    "the combination of low ejecta velocity and an intermediate luminosity suggest that  is not a true sn explosion .",
    "indeed , its luminosity is nearly an order of magnitude lower than even the claimed low - luminosity core - collapse sne 1994n , 1997d , 1999br , 1999eu , and 2001dc , with @xmath56 erg s@xmath2 at @xmath57 d @xcite .",
    "the low - resolution spectra of  are shown in figure  [ fig : ldss ] .",
    "convolution of the spectrum from may 31 with the transmission functions of the @xmath23 filters indicates that the flux calibration across the full spectral range is good to better than @xmath58 .",
    "the most pronounced spectral features are the hydrogen balmer emission lines , the [ ] doublet and the ir triplet in emission , and h&k in absorption .",
    "we additionally detect weak and emission lines , as well as and in absorption .",
    "a full list of the lines detected at each epoch is provided in table  [ tab : ldss ] .",
    "the h@xmath13 line is best fit by a lorentzian profile with a velocity width ( fwhm ) of @xmath59 km s@xmath2 ; see figure  [ fig : redlines ] .",
    "the full width at continuum intensity ( fwci ) is @xmath60 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the width of the line is indicates an expansion velocity of about 600 km s@xmath2 , in good agreement with our size and eruption date estimates (  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath13 flux remains relatively unchanged for the first 2 months , with @xmath61 erg s@xmath2 @xmath28 .",
    "the h@xmath14 line flux is @xmath62 erg s@xmath2 @xmath28 , leading to @xmath63 .",
    "this value is well in excess of @xmath64 expected for case b recombination ( at @xmath65 k appropriate for the sed temperature of ;  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "a large balmer decrement may be due to dust extinction , but as we already showed above ( and see also  [ sec : ext ] ) the line of sight extinction to  is negligible . instead , we conclude that the large balmer decrement is due to interaction with a high density circumstellar environment , through a combination of balmer self absorption and collisional excitation @xcite .",
    "the observed ratio is indeed in good agreement with circumstellar interaction models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    using the calculations of @xcite for hydrogen emission at high electron densities",
    ", we find that the observed @xmath66 ratio requires a density of @xmath67 @xmath68 . at this range of densities",
    "we expect the h@xmath69 line to be suppressed to a minimum ratio of @xmath70 ( compared to 0.45 for case b recombination ) .",
    "our non - detection of h@xmath69 on may 31 , with @xmath71 , and the detection on june 22 with @xmath72 support this conclusion .",
    "we note that the observed ratio @xmath73 ( june 22 ) is somewhat higher than the expected value of about 0.1 .",
    "we thus conclude that the balmer lines arise from circumstellar interaction between the event ejecta and the pre - existing environment .",
    "the h@xmath13 luminosity resulting from circumstellar interaction is given by @xmath74 erg s@xmath2 , where we have assumed a shell with @xmath75 and selected fiducial parameters for  as inferred above ( @xmath76 @xmath68 and @xmath77 cm ) .",
    "comparing with the observed h@xmath13 luminosity of @xmath78 erg s@xmath2 , we find that @xmath79 @xmath68 and @xmath80 , in reasonable agreement with the values inferred from the balmer line ratios and the blackbody fit to the sed .",
    "the shocked circumstellar material has an inferred mass of @xmath81 m@xmath5 . for a uniform wind with a constant velocity , @xmath82",
    ", this corresponds to a mass loss rate of @xmath83 m@xmath5 yr@xmath2 , where @xmath84 km s@xmath2 . as a sanity check",
    ", we find that the inferred thomson optical depth for these parameters is low , @xmath85 .    to summarize , the hydrogen balmer emission line properties , coupled with the optical / uv spectral energy distribution , are indicative of an interaction between a low mass shell traveling at about 600 km s@xmath2 with a high density circumstellar medium , resulting from a progenitor mass loss rate of @xmath86 m@xmath5 yr@xmath2 .",
    "we next turn to an investigation of the unusual permitted and forbidden lines , which are not generally detected in sn spectra ( particularly at early time ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : redlines ] , the [ ] lines are significantly narrower than the h@xmath13 line , with @xmath87 km s@xmath2",
    ". moreover , the lines are clearly asymmetric , ranging at continuum intensity from @xmath88 to @xmath89 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we do not find any clear evolution in the line brightness and profile between may 23 and june 22 ut .",
    "the ir triplet lines also exhibit a complex structure , with an overall symmetric profile , marked by strong absorption near the line center .",
    "the observed brighter blue wing indicates that the center of the absorption feature is redshifted relative to the emission center .",
    "we measure this shift to be about 80 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the overall width of the lines is @xmath90 km s@xmath2 , while the ( unresolved ) absorption component has @xmath91 km s@xmath2 .",
    "finally , the h&k absorption lines exhibit an asymmetric profile with an extended red wing ; see figure  [ fig : bluelines ] .",
    "the overall velocity range at continuum intensity in the may 31 spectrum is @xmath92 to @xmath93 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the lines appear to be somewhat narrower in the later spectrum from june 22 .",
    "the large velocity width of the lines indicates that they are not interstellar in origin , but instead arise in the circumstellar environment .",
    "however , the fact that we observe in absorption gas that is both inflowing ( red wing ) and outflowing ( blue wing ) , indicates that the lines do not arise exclusively from an outgoing wind associated with the eruption ; in that case we would expect only the outflowing ( blue ) component to be observed in absorption .    the existence of material inflowing along the line of sight to at velocities of up to @xmath94 km s@xmath2 can be explained as the result of : ( i ) gas infall from a previous eruption ; or ( ii ) as the signature of wind outflow from a companion star impinging on the progenitor of . in the former scenario ,",
    "the observed infall velocity , which we expect to be close to the progenitor s escape velocity , points to a massive and compact star such as a wolf - rayet star or a blue supergiant ; the velocity is much larger than would be expected for a red giant , a red supergiant , or an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) progenitor as proposed by @xcite and @xcite . in the latter scenario ,",
    "the companion would have to satisfy the same constraints ( massive and compact ) in order to launch a wind with @xmath3 km s@xmath2 .",
    "however , as we show in  [ sec : prog ] , the total progenitor system mass is in the range of @xmath10 m@xmath5 , making it difficult to accommodate an early - b or o star companion as required from the @xmath3 km s@xmath2 wind velocity @xcite .",
    "the general spectral properties outlined in the previous section are borne out in much greater detail and complexity in our high resolution spectra ; see figures  [ fig : mike1][fig : mike6 ] .",
    "these are the first such observations available for .",
    "we further stress that neither 85  nor sn2008s , which appear to share similar properties , have been observed at high spectral resolution so this is the first chance to investigate the properties of an ilot in detail .",
    "before we proceed with an analysis of the broad lines associated with the event itself , we use the d absorption lines to determine the line of sight extinction within ngc300 . in the may 20 spectrum",
    "we detect unresolved lines with the expected @xmath95 ratio of equivalent widths ( 0.17 and 0.08  ) , indicating that they are optically thin ; see figure  [ fig : hei ] .",
    "we find no evidence for variation in the line profiles between the various epochs . from the narrowness and lack of variability",
    "we conclude that the lines are interstellar in origin .",
    "the measured equivalent widths correspond to a negligible line of sight extinction of @xmath45 mag @xcite .",
    "this inference is in good agreement with the lack of obvious extinction evidences in the optical / uv spectral energy distribution .    in the spectra between june 6 and july 2",
    "we further detect broad d absorption , with @xmath96 km s@xmath2 ( figure  [ fig : hei ] ) .",
    "the lines are observed in emission in the spectrum from august 23 with a similar velocity width .",
    "the maximum absorption equivalent width is about 0.5   in the july 2 spectrum , close to the saturation limit of the relation between extinction and d equivalent width .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath97 for this value is @xmath98 mag , in rough agreement with the upper limit of @xmath44 mag inferred from the sed of (  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "we stress , however , that the relation between extinction and d equivalent width is calibrated in the interstellar medium , and there is therefore no reason that it should equally hold in the complex circumstellar environment of , particularly in the presence of bright uv emission from the eruption itself . indeed ,",
    "as we show below , we find definitive evidence for dust destruction , which would undoubtedly alter the nature of the relation .",
    "the broad and asymmetric h&k absorption lines are perhaps the most striking aspect of the spectrum ( figure  [ fig : cahk ] ) . from the high resolution spectrum obtained on june 6",
    "we find that the red wing of the lines is best modeled with a lorentzian profile centered at @xmath99 km s@xmath2 relative to the narrow component ( the systemic velocity ) , and with a width of @xmath100 km s@xmath2 ; a gaussian profile with @xmath101 km s@xmath2 provides a reasonable fit to the red wing as well .",
    "an extension of these profiles to the blue wing of the h&k lines significantly over - estimates the line absorption ( figure  [ fig : cahk ] ) .",
    "the blue wing itself is well fit by a lorentzian with a width of @xmath102 km s@xmath2 .",
    "it is unclear whether the two h&k absorption components ( red and blue wings ) arise in physically distinct regions ( with the red side that corresponds to the blue component perhaps contributing to the red wing ) , or whether they arise from a kinematically asymmetric distribution of a single absorbing component . in the former case",
    ", we interpret the line profiles to arise from the presence of both outflowing and inflowing gas in the circumstellar environment due to distinct mass loss episodes , fragmentation of a previously ejected shell , or the prsenence of a binary companion wind .",
    "this scenario is similar to the model proposed by @xcite for the yellow supergiant star irc+10420 , in which recombined gas no longer responds to radiation pressure , leading to infall at roughly the escape velocity .",
    "the measured infall velocity of @xmath3 km s@xmath2 is significantly higher than @xmath103 km s@xmath2 for absorption features in irc+10420 @xcite , indicating that the progenitor has a higher escape velocity ( i.e. , it is significantly more compact ) .",
    "subsequent echelle spectra reveal significant evolution in the h$k line profiles .",
    "first , the red absorption wing becomes progressively narrower with time , from about @xmath104 km s@xmath2 on june 6 to about @xmath105 km s@xmath2 on july 14 . at the same time",
    ", the blue absorption wing becomes narrower and eventually starts to be overtaken by emission with a fwci width of about 500 km s@xmath2 so that the overall line profile eventually resembles a reversed p cygni profile .",
    "both aspects of the line evolution can be explained as the result of recombination of ca@xmath106 gas produced through shocking of the initially absorbing gas by the eruption s outflowing material . in this scenario ,",
    "the blue - shifted ( outflowing ) gas and the highest velocity inflowing gas are located physically closer to the progenitor , while the lower velocity infalling material will be eventually overtaken by the shock at a later time .",
    "a hint of this effect is seen in the low signal - to - noise spectrum from august 23 , in which very little absorption in the red wing of the h&k lines is observed .",
    "the same process can also explain the shift from absorption to emission in the d lines .",
    "the low - resolution spectra of  showed that the triplet emission lines are marked by broad absorption features offset to the red from the emission line center . at high resolution",
    ", the line profile is more complex , and the absorption is separated into multiple components ; see figure  [ fig : cair ] .",
    "in particular , in the june 6 spectrum there appear to be three distinct absorption components in addition to a narrow ( interstellar ) component , with velocity widths of 200 , 100 , and 40 km s@xmath2 .",
    "all three components are centered redward of the emission line peak , by 30 , 200 , and 80 km s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "however , in our final spectrum from august 23 , the line profiles become simpler , with just a single absorption component redshifted relative to the emission line center .",
    "this may again point to the presence of an initially complex circumstellar environment , which is partially overtaken and shocked by the outflowing ejecta .",
    "the emission lines are symmetric and have a relatively constant width of @xmath107 km s@xmath2 in the various epochs .",
    "since the ionca2 ir lines are produced through radiative de - excitation from an excited state that is populated through absorption in the h&k lines , we expect the overall kinematic profiles of the h&k lines and the ir lines to match",
    ". however , the situation appears to be more complex here since the broad red absorption wing of the h$k lines does not appear to have a clear emission counterpart in the ir lines .",
    "another striking aspect of the echelle spectra is the strongly asymmetric profile of the [ ] lines , in which the blue wing is completely missing ; see figures  [ fig : caii_1 ] and [ fig : caii_2 ] .",
    "the red wing is best fit by a lorentzian profile with a width of @xmath108 km s@xmath2 in the may 20 and june 6 spectra , decreasing to @xmath109 km s@xmath2 in the june 14 and july 2 spectra , and finally @xmath110 km s@xmath2 in the august 23 spectra .",
    "these lines are therefore significantly narrower than the ir lines and exhibit a more pronounced decrease in width with time .",
    "this , along with the missing blue wing , indicate that the forbidden lines are produced in a physically distinct region from the ir lines . indeed , to avoid collisional excitation and de - excitation out of the meta - stable excited state that is responsible for the [ ] emission , the lines need to be produced in a lower density environment compared to the ir lines and the hydrogen balmer lines .    while the blue portion of the line is missing , we find no evidence for a p cygni profile .",
    "thus , the flux deficit is not due to absorption of the line emission by an optically thick outflow as generally observed for sne . instead",
    ", the line asymmetry may reflect an asymmetric distribution of the low density gas . in the context of the complex circumstellar environment inferred from the h&k and ir lines ,",
    "it is likely that the red wing is produced in the low density outer layers of the inflowing gas , with the blue wing emission being absorbed by intervening material .",
    "this scenario also explains the lower velocity width compared to the h&k lines .",
    "the spectra from july 2 and august 23 reveal the emergence of low level emission on the blue side of the forbidden lines .",
    "this increase coincides with the emergence of h&k emission on the blue side of the lines (  [ sec : hk ] ) , and it is likely due to the same process of ca@xmath106 recombination .    finally ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , we note that the energy required to ionize ca@xmath111 to ca@xmath106 from the meta - stable excited state ( which if left undisturbed would produce the [ ] doublet through radiative de - excitation ) corresponds to 1218.9  , or about 3.2   above the ly@xmath13 line .",
    "thus , when the ly@xmath13 line is broader than about 800 km / s , the [ ] doublet emission can be strongly suppressed by ionization . for narrow ly@xmath13 emission this effect is inefficient and we expect stronger [ ] emission .",
    "this is indeed the case for , for which the typical lines widths are @xmath112 km s@xmath2 . as a result",
    ", we expect that events like  will generally exhibit strong [ ] emission lines .      the h@xmath13 line , which appears to have a symmetric profile at low resolution , exhibits a more complex combination of emission and absorption when viewed at high spectral resolution ; see figure  [ fig : ha ] . at all epochs",
    "we find a narrow absorption feature close to the line center , with a width of @xmath113 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the absorption feature is redshifted by about 30 km s@xmath2 relative to the interstellar absorption of the lines .",
    "a second , but weaker , absorption component with a similar velocity width is detected at a velocity of @xmath114 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the overall emission profile can be fit with either a lorentzian profile or a combination of narrow and broad gaussian profiles , which are slightly offset in velocity .",
    "the motivation behind the latter model is that the broad wings of the line appear to be somewhat asymmetric , with a slight deficit in the blue portion of the line . in the lorentzian case",

    "the aperture size was selected to reduce contamination from nearby objects .",
    "we further used the standard zeropoints and aperture corrections provided in the _ spitzer _ manual .",
    "the resulting spectral energy distribution of the coincident source , along with the hst upper limits , is shown in figure  [ fig : spitzer_hst ] .      a detailed discussion of the progenitor is presented by @xcite who conclude that it is an extreme agb star during a short - lived phase ( @xmath131 yr ) of its evolution .",
    "below we provide an independent analysis of the _ spitzer _ and hst observations .",
    "the spectral energy distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : spitzer_hst ] .",
    "we find that the sed is well fit by a blackbody profile ( @xmath132 for 3 degrees of freedom ) , indicating that the progenitor was enshrouded by dust prior to the eruption .",
    "the best - fit blackbody parameters are @xmath133 k and @xmath134 au , with a resulting luminosity of @xmath135 l@xmath5 .",
    "the total dust mass can be inferred by setting @xmath136 , which for @xmath137 @xmath138 g@xmath2 @xcite , corresponds to @xmath139 m@xmath5 .",
    "the fact that the progenitor was completely obscured by dust , while  exhibits negligible dust extinction ( @xmath44 mag ;  [ sec : prop ] ) demonstrates that the eruption destroyed the obscuring dust .",
    "since the size of the dust - obscured region exceeds the shock radius of  by about a factor of 20 (  [ sec : prop ] ) , we conclude that the dust was destroyed through sublimation rather than shock heating .",
    "this process has been investigated by several authors , and we use here the formulation of @xcite developed in the context of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the dust destruction radius is given by @xmath140 cm , for a typical grain size of 0.1 @xmath35 m and a dust absorption efficiency factor of order unity @xcite .",
    "for the radius of the dust - obscured region inferred above , we find that the luminosity required for sublimation is @xmath141 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude larger than the bolometric luminosity measured for  on may 31 ( @xmath142 d ) .",
    "the measured decay rate of about 0.02 mag d@xmath2 extrapolated back to the estimated eruption date is not sufficient to overcome this discrepancy .",
    "we therefore conclude that either the early emission from  was characterized by a higher photospheric temperature , or the initial event produced a relatively bright uv flash with a luminosity of about @xmath143 erg s@xmath2 .    in either case , the destruction of the obscuring dust may be responsible for the strong emission , since the calcium is initially strongly depleted on dust grains .",
    "our detailed spectroscopic observations of , and the detection of its progenitor system in archival data , allow us to construct a basic model of the event and its environment .",
    "the key observational results presented in the preceding sections are summarized as follows :    * the line of sight extinction is negligible as inferred from the uv / optical sed and the weak d lines . * prior to the event , the progenitor system was enshrouded by dust , and had a luminosity of about @xmath4 l@xmath5 , corresponding to a @xmath10 m@xmath5 star . *",
    "the wide and asymmetric h&k absorption lines require gas infall at velocities of about @xmath144 km s@xmath2 , and hence a massive and relatively compact progenitor or companion . * the ir lines and the hydrogen balmer lines are symmetric and broad ( @xmath145 km s@xmath2 ) , and marked by narrow absorption redward of the emission line peak . *",
    "the [ ] lines are extremely asymmetric , and significantly narrower than the other lines and hydrogen balmer lines . * none of the lines exhibit velocities in excess of @xmath3 km s@xmath2 , or p cygni profiles .",
    "these properties bear a striking resemblance to those of the massive yellow hypergiant irc+10420 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is thought to be rapidly transitioning from a red supergiant phase to a luminous blue variable or wolf - rayet phase . like the progenitor of , irc+10420",
    "is marked by a bright infrared excess resulting from a dusty nebula , but unlike  the central object is not completely obscured .",
    "the luminosity of irc+10420 , @xmath146 l@xmath5 , is about an order of magnitude larger than our inferred luminosity of the progenitor of  (  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "this points either to a lower mass or a somewhat earlier evolutionary stage for the progenitor of .",
    "equally important , irc+10420 exhibits essentially identical hydrogen balmer and ir line profiles to those seen in our high resolution spectra , including the redshifted narrow absorption feature ( see figures 4 and 5 of @xcite and figures 3 and 4 of @xcite ) .    at the same time , there are some distinct difference between the spectroscopic properties of  and irc+10420 .",
    "first , the ionca2 h&k lines in irc+10420 are symmetric and significantly narrower than those observed in  @xcite .",
    "second , the [ ] emission lines in irc+10420 appear to be symmetric @xcite , although like in the case of  they are significantly narrower than the hydrogen balmer lines and the ir lines .",
    "third , the ir lines , which extend to about @xmath147 km s@xmath2 @xcite , are significantly narrower than in . finally ,",
    "while the h@xmath13 profiles in both objects are generally similar , the red and blue emission peaks of irc+10420 have a similar width to the central absorption @xcite , whereas in the case of  the emission peaks are significantly wider . in both cases the h@xmath13 line exhibit a broad wing , which is interpreted as the effect of electron scattering in the case of irc+10420 @xcite . in the spectrum of , however , the core of the line is broader and the wings are less pronounced , and we interpret the profile as due to circumstellar interaction of an outflow with a velocity of about 600 km s@xmath2 ( as opposed to a outflowing wind velocity of only 50 km s@xmath2 inferred for irc+10420 ) .",
    "the combination of these various properties suggests that in broad terms the progenitor of  may be similar to irc+10420 , but it may have been in a somewhat different evolutionary stage prior to the eruption , with still complete dust obscuration . in addition , the eruption itself appears to have produced a significantly faster , more energetic , and more luminous outflow compared to the `` quiescent '' state of irc+10420 .",
    "thus , it is possible that  marks the initial transition to an irc+10420-like object , and that as the eruption fades , its properties will converge to those of irc+10420 .",
    "we finally turn to a comparison of  with two recent events that exhibit several similar properties : 85  and sn2008s .",
    "sn2008s was discovered on february 1.8 ut in ngc6946 ( @xmath148 mpc ) and had an absolute magnitude of @xmath149 mag ( taking into account significant galactic and host obscuration of @xmath150 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath151-band light curve of sn2008s from @xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : lcs ] .",
    "the temporal evolution is remarkably similar to that of , namely a relatively stable decay rate of about 0.035 mag d@xmath2 from about 30 to 100 days .",
    "however , unlike , the optical emission from sn2008s does not exhibit a clear steepening at later times , and it may indeed flatten to a decay rate of about 0.01 mag d@xmath2 from 130 to 270 days .",
    "in figure  [ fig:2008s ] we present a low - resolution spectrum of sn2008s that we obtained on 2008 mar 15.5 ut ( @xmath152 d ) using the arc 3.5-m telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "the resolution of the spectrum is 6.5  , or about 300 km s@xmath2 .",
    "neglecting extinction , we find that the overall continuum shape and brightness are characterized by a blackbody profile with @xmath153 k and @xmath154 cm , similar to the properties inferred for  at a similar epoch of about 44 d ( figure  [ fig : spitzer_hst ] ) .",
    "the inferred bolometric absolute magnitude is @xmath155 mag .",
    "however , if we include the estimated extinction of @xmath150 mag , we find that the spectrum requires a higher temperature , @xmath156 k , and a smaller radius , @xmath157 cm , leading to an overall absolute magnitude of @xmath158 mag , similar to the values inferred by @xcite from similar spectroscopic observations .",
    "thus , sn2008s has a bolometric luminosity that is nearly an order of magnitude larger than .",
    "combined with the similar temporal evolution , we conclude that sn2008s released about an order of magnitude more energy than , @xmath159 erg ( see also @xcite ) .    the overall similarity in also evident in the dominant spectral features of both events .",
    "sn2008s exhibits strong and narrow hydrogen balmer lines , [ ] lines , and ir lines .",
    "the h@xmath13 line is resolved with a width of @xmath160 km s@xmath2 , about a factor of 2 times broader than for . as in the case of , the ir triplet lines",
    "exhibit a similar width to that of h@xmath13 , @xmath161 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the [ ] lines are only marginally resolved , with @xmath162 km s@xmath2 .",
    "this is again a factor of 2 times broader than in , and comparably narrower than the h@xmath13 line .",
    "due to the low resolution of the spectrum it is unclear whether the [ ] lines are asymmetric . unlike in the case of",
    ", we do not detect h&k absorption or emission .    finally , perhaps the most important similarity between sn2008s and  is the detection of a coincident _ spitzer _ source in both events @xcite . as shown in figure  [ fig : spitzer_hst ] , the seds of both coincident sources are similar , with @xmath163 k , @xmath164 au , and @xmath165 l@xmath5 for sn2008s . thus , both events appear to arise from objects of a similar luminosity and in a similar evolutionary stage .",
    "@xcite recently argued that the progenitors of both events are extreme agb stars with masses of @xmath166 m@xmath5 , and that the events themselves are likely electron - capture sne .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , advocated a scenario for sn2008s of a super - eddington eruption that results in significant mass loss .",
    "they further note an overall similarity to irc+10420 , and speculate that sn2008s resembles an eruption of a @xmath167 m@xmath5 blue supergiant , rather than a lower mass red supergiant as advocated by @xcite .",
    "our high resolution spectroscopic observations of , and their close resemblance to the spectrum of irc+10420 , support the interpretation of @xcite . still , while both events appear to arise from similar objects , these progenitors are clearly capable of producing eruptions with an energy release that spans at least an order of magnitude .",
    "we next turn to a comparison with 85 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : optsed ] , the spectral energy distribution of this event closely resembles , with a nearly identical bolometric luminosity of about @xmath168 mag @xcite .",
    "the light curve evolution is also similar ( figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) , with a comparable decay rate during the first @xmath169 days , followed by a significant steepening at later time .",
    "thus , 85  appears to be a clear analog of both  and sn2008s .",
    "unfortunately , the low - resolution spectra of 85 , obtained about 1 and 48 d after discovery @xcite , had a low signal - to - noise ratio that precludes a detailed analysis .",
    "still , the second spectrum does exhibit a narrow h@xmath13 emission line with @xmath170 km s@xmath2 , about two times narrower than in .",
    "additional weak features possibly corresponding to h&k and @xmath171 may also be discerned in the spectrum ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "these possible features provide additional support for a common origin with .    on the other hand ,",
    "the environments of  and 85  differ significantly . in the case of 85",
    ", the host is an early type galaxy ( with a mean age of @xmath172 gyr ) , and the environment of the transient itself contains no stars brighter than @xmath173 mag , corresponding to a mass of @xmath174 m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the local environment of , on the other hand , contains stars with inferred masses of @xmath175 m@xmath5 @xcite , in line with the inferred mass of the progenitor system .",
    "thus , it appears that different channels / progenitors may lead to the formation of similar transient outbursts .",
    "given the overall similarity between the three events it is reasonable to conclude that they share a common origin .",
    "thanks to our detailed high - resolution spectroscopic observations of , an intimate connection with objects like irc+10420 appears likely ( in agreement with previous speculation @xcite ) but may not be required ( e.g. , 85 ) . from the overall similarity we further conclude that none of the three transients are likely to have resulted from the explosion of the progenitor star . instead , the eruptions may mark a shift in the evolutionary stage from complete obscuration to a yellow supergiant phase , and eventually a wolf - rayet star .",
    "clearly , such a transition apparently leads to overall common features , but in detail the energy and velocity of the outflow appear to vary by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "we presented the first high - resolution spectroscopic observations for the intermediate luminosity optical transient , as well as multi - wavelength observations ( uv / optical / radio / x - ray ) and an independent analysis of archival _ spitzer _ and hst observations of its progenitor ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the preponderance of photometric and spectroscopic evidence indicate that this event is not a supernova , but is instead the result of an eruption on a @xmath6 m@xmath5 blue supergiant or pre - wolf - rayet star , possibly in a binary system .",
    "the high - resolution spectra reveal the presence of a complex circumstellar environment , marked by outflows and possible inflow from previous ejections or from a companion wind .",
    "the observed inflow velocities are indicative of a massive and relatively compact progenitor , not a highly extended red supergiant , in contrast to the interpretation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the progenitor may be part of a binary system in which the companion wind ( with a velocity of @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ) is observed in absorption along the line of sight . in this scenario , however , it may be difficult to accommodate the relatively low total system mass of @xmath176 m@xmath5 .",
    "the outburst itself gave rise to an outflow with a velocity of @xmath177 km s@xmath2 and a kinetic energy of at least @xmath54 erg .",
    "no radio or x - ray emission are detected to limits that are significantly dimmer than the faintest sne detected to date , indicating a lack of fast ejecta ( with @xmath178 ) .",
    "closely resembles two previous events , 85  and sn2008s , in terms of its intermediate luminosity and spectral properties .",
    "it also shares with sn2008s a dust - obscured progenitor with a luminosity of a @xmath179 l@xmath5 .",
    "our detailed comparison reveals that the outburst and progenitor properties point to a common origin , but with a range of outburst energy and velocity of nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "we also note a resemblance between the spectroscopic properties of  and those of the luminous yellow supergiant irc+10420 .",
    "however , the latter is about an order of magnitude more luminous than the progenitor of , and its observed `` quiescent '' outflow has a velocity of only @xmath180 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these differences raise the possibility that  marks the transition to an irc+10420-like state , or that its progenitor is simply a lower mass analogue .    while our optical / uv photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy are of similar quality to those of sn2008s and 85 , our extensive echelle spectroscopy provides a much deeper view of the circumstellar environment than previously available for this class of events .",
    "indeed , we stress that the overall photometric behavior and general spectroscopic features observed in  may be generic to a broad class of stellar eruptions with an intermediate velocity in the presence of a dense circumstellar environment .",
    "for example , the 2002 eruption of v838 mon was similar in broad terms to that of , 85 , and sn2008s , based on a comparable light curve behavior and spectroscopic evidence for narrow h@xmath13 and lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the eruption was about an order of magnitude less luminous than  and 85 , and the progenitor appears to have been a lower mass star .",
    "we conclude that a clear understanding of the broad range of ilots requires high - resolution spectroscopy to assess the detailed properties of the circumstellar environment , as well as the identification of progenitors ; optical / ir photometry and low - resolution spectroscopy alone are not likely to be sufficient .",
    "finally , the main prediction of our model is that the progenitor of  should be visible following the decay of the event . if the current eruption is similar to previous events that produced the now - destroyed dust shell , than the progenitor would again be visible as an obscured ir source .",
    "however , if only a minor amount of dust reforms , we predict that the spectrum will more closely resemble that of irc+10420 . in either case",
    "it appears that events like represent an important stage in the evolution of massive stars toward their eventual demise in sn explosions .",
    "the advent of facilities such as pan - starrs and lsst will lead to an increased rate of detections of events similar to . from the observations presented here",
    "it is clear that multi - wavelength follow - up , in particular high - resolution spectroscopy , which is not typically attempted for sne ( cf .",
    "sn2008s ) , is critical for a detailed understanding of the eruption process and the properties of the progenitor(s ) .",

    "<S> we present multi - epoch high - resolution optical spectroscopy , uv / radio / x - ray imaging , and archival _ hubble _ and _ spitzer _ observations of an intermediate luminosity optical transient recently discovered in the nearby galaxy ngc300 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transient ( ngc300ot2008 - 1 ) has a peak absolute magnitude of @xmath0 mag , intermediate between novae and supernovae , and similar to the recent events m85ot2006 - 1 and sn2008s . </S>",
    "<S> our high - resolution spectra , the first for this event , are dominated by intermediate velocity ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) hydrogen balmer lines and emission and absorption lines that point to a complex circumstellar environment , reminiscent of the yellow hypergiant irc+10420 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we detect broad h&k absorption with an asymmetric _ red _ wing extending to @xmath3 km s@xmath2 , indicative of gas infall onto a massive and relatively compact star ( blue supergiant or wolf - rayet star ) ; an extended red supergiant progenitor is unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the inflowing gas may be a previous ejection from the progenitor or the wind of a massive binary companion . </S>",
    "<S> the low luminosity , intermediate velocities , and overall similarity to a known eruptive star indicate that the event did not result in a complete disruption of the progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the progenitor in archival _ spitzer _ observations , with deep upper limits from _ </S>",
    "<S> hubble _ data . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral energy distribution points to a dust - enshrouded star with a luminosity of about @xmath4 l@xmath5 , indicative of a @xmath6 m@xmath5 progenitor ( or binary system ) . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is in good agreement with our interpretation of the outburst and circumstellar properties . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of significant extinction in the transient spectrum indicates that the dust surrounding the progenitor was cleared by the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> we thus predict that the progenitor should be eventually visible with _ hubble _ if the transient event marks an evolutionary transition to a dust - free state , or with _ spitzer _ if the event marks a cyclical process of dust formation . </S>"
