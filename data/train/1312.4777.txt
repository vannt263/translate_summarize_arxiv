    "iron - based superconductors are the major field in superconductivity now@xcite",
    ". one of today s major challenge in the study of iron - based superconductors is how to obtain an unified microscopic understanding of the different families of these materials , in particular , iron - pnicitides and iron - chalcogenides , which distinguish themselves from each other with distinct fermi surface topologies@xcite .",
    "theoretical studies based on models with complicated multi - d orbital band structures@xcite , lack of a support from more fundamental microscopic electronic physics@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the underlining electronic structure in iron - based superconductors , which is responsible for superconductivity at low energy , is essentially governed by a two - orbital model with a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the two orbital model includes two nearly degenerated single - orbital parts that can be mapped to each other under the @xmath0 transformation .",
    "this electronic structure stems from the fact that the dynamics of @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals are divided into two groups that are separately coupled to the top and bottom as(se ) planes in a single fe-(as)se trilayer structure .",
    "the two groups can thus be treated as an @xmath0 iso - spin .",
    "the dressing of other orbitals in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals can not alter the symmetry characters . despite the simplicity of this description ,",
    "the model not only gives very good quantitative agreement with the band structure but also supply a uniform model to mimic different iron - based material classes , especially for the iron - pnictides and iron - chalcogenides@xcite .",
    "some of us have performed a finite temperature determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) study of the pairing correlation in the @xmath0 symmetric microscopic model on lattices mainly with @xmath5 sites .",
    "it is found that the pairing with an extensive @xmath6-wave symmetry robustly dominates over other pairings at low temperature in reasonable parameter region regardless of the change of fermi surface topologies .",
    "the pairing susceptibility , the effective pairing interaction and the @xmath7 antiferromagneticcorrelation strongly increase as the on - site coulomb interaction increases , and these non - biased numerical results provide a possible unified understanding of superconducting mechanism in iron - pnictides and iron - chalcogenides@xcite .",
    "numerical approaches like dqmc , however , had its own difficulties , typically being limited to small sizes , high temperature , and experience the infamous fermion sign problem , which cases exponential growth in the variance of the computed results and hence an exponential growth in computer time as the lattice size is increased and the temperature is lowered@xcite . in general , to determine which pairing symmetry is dominant by numerical calculation for finite size models , we have to look at the long - range part of the pair - correlation function at zero temperature , and it seems to be dangerous to extrapolate the long - range behavior of the pair - correlation function from a lattice with @xmath5 sites . in order to shed light on this critical issue , it is important to discuss the results obtained from the constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc)@xcite on larger lattice . in a variety of benchmarking calculations ,",
    "the cpmc method has yielded very accurate results of the ground state energy and many other ground state observables for large system@xcite . in the cpmc method",
    ", the ground - state wave function @xmath8 is projected from an initial wave function @xmath9 by a branching random walk in an over - complete space of constrained slater determinants @xmath10 , which have positive overlaps with a known trial wave function .",
    "in such a space , we can write @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "the random walk produces an ensemble of @xmath10 , called random walkers , which represent @xmath8 in the sense that their distribution is a monte carlo sampling of @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting method is free of @xmath14 decay of the signal - to - noise ratio . for more technique details",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report the ground state results in the @xmath0 symmetric microscopic model for various electron fillings , interaction strength by using cpmc method .",
    "the simulations were mainly performed on a @xmath15 lattices , and compared to the paring correlation on an @xmath5 , a @xmath16 and a @xmath17 lattices .",
    "all the lattices are with periodic boundary conditions.our unbiased numerical calculation shows that the ground state @xmath1 pairing",
    "dominate over other pairing correlations .",
    "the @xmath1 pairing correlations is positive when the pair separation exceeds several lattice constants , whatever for iron pnictides and iron chlcogenides .",
    "these ground state properties , especially the long range part pairing correlations re - conform our previous finite temperature results with dqmc method@xcite .",
    "we further our study by including the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 .",
    "it is found that the @xmath1 pairing correlation is slightly suppressed by the increasing @xmath2 .",

    "the vertex contribution of @xmath1 pairing symmetry is a finite value over the long range part , while vertex contributions of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are simply fluctuating around zero . in the numerical results ,",
    "the ratio of the statistical error to the pairing correlation @xmath56 is no more than 0.5 percent , and most of the error bars are almost within the symbols .",
