    "<S> this is because that as the number of directional couplers increases ; multi - path interference occurred and hence complicated interference patterns show up .    in the case of qzifm , we positioned the absorber about @xmath45 nm away from the upper arm of the interferometer , such that all the light is coupled to the absorber from the upper arm . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the scenario depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ concept_qzifm]*b*. in this case , we expect to obtain high output in the lower arm and low output in the upper arm . </S>",
    "<S> we present the laser characterization of a qzifm device with absorbers in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data_qz]*b*. we clearly observe that the high - contrast interference disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the small modulations visible in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data_qz]*c * originate from the fabry - prot interferometer formed by input and output grating couplers as confirmed with independently tested calibration devices .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data_qz]*c * shows the normalized efficiencies of qzifm devices with different numbers of directional couplers . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained these results by using a strongly attenuated laser as the light source and single - photon detectors ( the same as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ data_ev ] * c * ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we derive the normalized efficiencies of ifm via @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the single - photon counts from gc 1 , 3 and 5 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we assume the coupling and detecting efficiencies are the same for t and l outputs because we use the same fiber and detector to measure @xmath47 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained @xmath48 of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the solid black curve is the theoretical prediction of a lossless device . </S>",
    "<S> the red dashed and green dotted curves are the predictions with @xmath52 and @xmath43 loss per stage  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> data of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are in good agreement with the red dashed curve . </S>",
    "<S> we note that for larger @xmath19 , the device becomes so long that we have to define the lithographic pattern over multiple electron beam write fields . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we attribute the extra loss to the stitching error between waveguides in different write fields  @xcite and the build - up of the mode - conversion loss in the coupling regions  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we report the realizations of interaction - free measurement via quantum zeno effect on a silicon photonic chip </S>",
    "<S> . the future direction would be to further enhance the efficiency of ifm with lower - loss circuitry  @xcite and on - chip single - photon detectors  @xcite . additionally , by using micro - ring resonators , it is possible to further enhance the efficiency of ifm as well as to interrogate the presence of a single absorber via multiple passages , which could be useful for certain practical implementations . </S>",
    "<S> our realizations of the interaction - free measurement via quantum zeno effect could be useful in spectroscopic studying photosensitive materials .    </S>",
