    "magnetic systems with frustration induced by competing exchange interactions quite often manifest unconventional ground states , the most intriguing of which are spin - liquids@xcite . recently",
    "one such exotic state , a spiral spin - liquid , was uncovered theoretically in a classical treatment of diamond - lattice heisenberg antiferromagnets ( afm ) by bergman _",
    "et al._@xcite who showed that competition between nearest and next - nearest neighbor exchange couplings @xmath9 and @xmath2 creates - for @xmath101/8 - a highly degenerate ground state consisting of a set of coplanar spirals , whose propagation vectors form a continuous surface in momentum space",
    ". the frustration results in a rich phase diagram as a function of the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the degeneracy of these ground states can be lifted by thermal@xcite or quantum@xcite fluctuations leading to an order - by - disorder phase transition from a spiral spin - liquid regime to an ordered state .",
    "+ among the diamond - lattice afm , compounds with the spinel structure recently attracted much attention@xcite .",
    "in particular , co - al oxides were considered as promising candidates for study of order - by - disorder physics @xcite . in these compounds of general stoichiometry",
    "ab@xmath11o@xmath12 the tetrahedral a - sites are occupied by high - spin ( s=3/2 ) magnetic co@xmath13 ions which form a diamond lattice consisting of two interpenetrating face - centered cubic sublattices coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the octahedral b - sites can be filled either by nonmagnetic al@xmath4 ions and/or by low - spin ( s=0 ) nonmagnetic co@xmath4 ions .",
    "+ existing experiments on co - al oxide spinels do not provide a clear picture .",
    "an early neutron - diffraction study@xcite on @xmath14 showed that the magnetic moments of the co@xmath13 ions located at the tetrahedral sites form a simple collinear afm below the neel temperature t@xmath5=40 k. this picture has been questioned by a recent @xmath15sr study@xcite which found two frequency components near t@xmath5 suggesting incommensurate magnetic order .",
    "experimental observations on @xmath16 are also contradictory .",
    "a powder neutron diffraction study of roth@xcite suggested long - range afm order below 4 k , while krimmel _",
    "et al._@xcite detected a spin liquid ( or glassy - like ) ground state .",
    "electron spin resonance ( esr ) , magnetization and specific heat measurements identified the ground state of @xmath16 as spin - glass - like with a high frustration parameter @xmath17t@xmath18@xmath17/t@xmath5 of 22 [ ref . ] and 10 [ ref . ] , respectively .",
    "these experimental results are consistent with the calculations of bergman _",
    "et al._@xcite which placed @xmath16 in the region of @xmath19 1/8 where the spiral surface begins to develop .",
    "to clarify the situation , it is essential to understand whether the ground state of @xmath14 is a simple collinear antiferromagnet and if @xmath16 is a spiral spin - liquid fluctuating among degenerate spirals .",
    "it is also important to understand why substitution within the nonmagnetic b - site changes the magnetic properties so drastically .",
    "et al._@xcite attempted to answer these questions based on bulk macroscopic measurements of @xmath1 system .",
    "they proposed that the spin - liquid state is realized in @xmath16 ( x=0 ) , while with increasing co substitution x the second neighbor coupling @xmath2 decreases and collinear afm long - range order develops .",
    "+ in this work we address these important issues and refine the evolution of the magnetic states in @xmath1 spinels by means of neutron powder diffraction supported by monte - carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals that for x=0 the system is close to the critical point @xmath8=1/8 in the phase diagram while frustration is weaker for x@xmath200 .",
    "we argue that magnetic anisotropy assists in the selection of a collinear long - range ordered ground state .",
    "the difference in t@xmath5 and in the extent of the spin - liquid regime apparently originates from the decrease of the @xmath8 ratio with increasing x. + polycrystalline @xmath1 samples with x=0 , 0.35 , 0.75 and 1 have been prepared as reported in ref .  .",
    "thorough structural characterizations by high - resolution x - ray synchrotron diffraction ( on the materials science beamline at swiss light source , @xmath21=0.41414   ) and neutron diffraction ( on the hrpt diffractometer at the swiss neutron spallation source sinq , @xmath21=1.1545   ) indicated the absence of inversion in all samples excepting @xmath16 . for the latter compound",
    "the inversion is 17% and this might influence t@xmath5 .",
    "analyzing the lattice constants and x - ray peak profiles we concluded that the co@xmath4 ions are homogeneously and randomly distributed over the b - sites .",
    "this follows because ( i ) the lattice constants obey vegard s law as the function of x and ( ii ) there is no peak asymmetry , which would have been present in the high - resolution data if any significant degree of inhomogeneity was present .",
    "+      medium - resolution neutron powder diffraction patterns for four compositions have been collected in the temperature range 1.5 k - 150 k on the dmc instrument at sinq with a neutron wavelength @xmath21=2.4526   . for",
    "all compositions , broad bumps resembling a liquid - like structure factor and reflecting short - range magnetic order start to develop below the curie - weiss temperature @xmath23=110 k@xcite ; they narrow and shift to higher sin@xmath24 with cooling ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . approaching t@xmath5 the diffuse scattering localizes near the @xmath22111@xmath20 and @xmath22200@xmath20 positions .",
    "below t@xmath5 the liquid - like features remain but gradually loose spectral weight as magnetic bragg peaks due to long - range order develop .",
    "the spectral weight of the diffuse scattering component continuously increases from @xmath14 to @xmath16 ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) as the frustration parameter @xmath17t@xmath18@xmath17/t@xmath5 grows .",
    "we can quantify it by the area of a lorentzian fitted to the first diffuse bump .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] this area is largest roughly at t / t@xmath251 for all compositions , but for x=0 and x=0.35 diffuse scattering develops far above and remains significantly below this value . for x=1 the t / t@xmath5 interval revealing",
    "diffuse scattering is narrower but still much to large to be interpreted as classical critical scattering of a 3d long - range ordered magnet .    regarding the long - range order , all samples show magnetic bragg peaks at low temperatures .",
    "the ordering temperature t@xmath5 and the static ordered magnetic moment decrease from @xmath14 to @xmath16 ( see table  [ tab1 ] and inset of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the x=0 diffraction pattern does not correspond to a conventional long - range ordered state : diffuse scattering clearly dominates and the @xmath22200@xmath20 peak is so broad and weak that the ordered moment can not be determined with high accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , the magnetic bragg pattern is the same for all compositions and is consistent with the collinear two - sublattice model proposed by roth@xcite .",
    "+       to model the observed magnetic diffuse scattering we used the quasistatic approximation@xcite , which assumes that the observed diffuse scattering can be attributed to static correlations .",
    "this approach is justified since the bandwidth of magnetic excitations is below 6 mev whereas all scattering with energies below 14.7 mev is summed in our diffraction experiment .",
    "we performed a monte - carlo search for the ground state of a cluster of 1047 atoms .",
    "the energy of the classical heisenberg hamiltonian for spins @xmath26 interacting with first- and second - neighbour antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath27 @xmath28 was minimized ( @xmath29 means that the sum runs over first - neighbour pairs , @xmath30 on second - neighbours pairs ) .",
    "if we add either a third - neighbour interaction or an anisotropy contribution , the hamiltonian will be completed with an additional term @xmath31 , given , respectively , as @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 refers to third - neighbours pairs and @xmath35 is the anisotropy direction , that we took as ( 111 ) .",
    "@xmath6 is the magnitude of the anisotropy term .",
    "the moments were kept equal and constant in magnitude ; their direction was changed at random , one at the time , and to obtain the ground state only energy - decreasing moves were accepted in the final stage .",
    "the stopping criterion for the monte - carlo was that the last 1000 accepted configurations had an energy spread less than 10@xmath36 @xmath9 .",
    "runs have been repeated for the whole range 0@xmath371 .",
    "we calculated the static spin - pair correlation functions and diffraction patterns for the monte - carlo ground state ( mcgs ) and the reference afm clusters for each @xmath8 .",
    "the correlation function is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distance between spins at positions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we found that for the range 0@xmath421/8 the collinear afm is the ground state , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "remarkably , the mcgs was always configurationally different from a collinear afm state even if the energy difference was negligible ( order of 1 mk or less ) . analytical calculations ( fig .  [ fig3 ] inset ) , similar to ref .  , support this result .",
    "in fact , the energy minimum corresponding to the ground state for @xmath431/8 is extremely flat around the @xmath44=0 point of the first brillouin zone , and therefore , very many states are in the range of thermal excitation at any accessible temperature . + the mcgs starts closely related to the collinear afm state , but progressively departs from it with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "this is clearly seen in the decay of spin correlations , which can be quantified by the ratio @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot log@xmath46 versus squared distance @xmath47 between spins .",
    "near @xmath48=1/8 the decay changes from predominantly gaussian @xmath49 ( a straight line in this choice of axes ) to a mixed gaussian - exponential form @xmath50 ( a curve bending downwards for 200@xmath51400 @xmath52 ) .",
    "this behaviour can be attributed to the incipient spiral surface . in the calculated diffraction patterns ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , top ) these changes are evidenced as progressive broadening and distortion of bragg peaks .",
    "pure gaussian correlation decay yields a gaussian peak broadening , whereas gaussian - exponential decay yields voigtian point spread ( that is , with a sizable lorentzian convolution component ) .",
    "for @xmath530.5 the correlations are completely changed and features of the collinear afm state fade out .",
    "+      we now compare the experimental and calculated diffuse scattering .",
    "the patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] were obtained as differences between data measured at t= 6 , 15 , 19 and 45 k ( for x=0 , 0.35 , 0.75 and 1 , respectively ) and 150 k. in the calculated patterns in order to obtain the ordered afm state at @xmath54 we needed to perturb the simple heisenberg hamiltonian so that the afm minimum would be deeper and the afm configration more stable . for this",
    "we considered separately two possible degeneracy - breaking perturbations : magnetic anisotropy and finite @xmath55 coupling . to retain a simple model we described anisotropy as a single - ion parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the mc procedure was now changed , allowing for system equilibrations at different temperatures . all moves that would decrease the energy or",
    "that would increase it with probability @xmath56 were accepted@xcite .",
    "when the average and fluctuations of the energy of a large number of the last accepted states were sufficiently stable the temperature was changed .",
    "fixing @xmath57=1 as a convenient energy scale , @xmath58 , @xmath55 , @xmath6 or t were varied , each in several steps .",
    "+     ratios at t = 0 k. bottom : observed ( symbols ) and calculated ( line ) powder diffraction patterns for x=0 and x=1 corresponding to the best model parameters .",
    "the calculated patterns are corrected for the magnetic form factor of co@xmath4 and polynomial background.,width=325 ]    equally good fits were obtained with @xmath55 and magnetic anisotropy @xmath6 as perturbations , signifying that the available diffraction data are not sufficient to determine which of these terms stabilizes the ordered ground state .",
    "however , we give preference to the magnetic anisotropy following the theoretical study of ref .  .",
    "the best fits presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( bottom ) suggest the ratio @xmath8=0.125 for @xmath59 and @xmath8=0.05 for @xmath60 .",
    "the change of the exchange energy with substitution apparently originates from the peculiarities of the electronic structure .",
    "band structure analysis@xcite shows that near the fermi level in @xmath60 there are co@xmath4 @xmath39 and oxygen @xmath61 states , while in @xmath59 the al @xmath61 states are absent from the fermi level and the weight of o @xmath61 is diminished .",
    "this implies that the interaction path o - co@xmath4-o is more effective and the corresponding exchange integrals are larger in @xmath60 .",
    "+ our findings give a natural explanation of the @xmath15sr results@xcite on @xmath60 as due to spin - liquid physics rather than incommensurate magnetic order . also , based on the position of @xmath59 in the @xmath8 phase diagram , we suggest that even in an ideal sample , with no inversion or other perturbation , the ground state would be a collinear afm , though one might need very low temperatures to reach it . as the ground state",
    "is the collinear afm the general term spin - liquid and not chiral spin - liquid is appropriate for the high - temperature regime above t@xmath5 in the title system .",
    "+ a single crystal inelastic neutron scattering experiment would allow to extract the absolute values of @xmath62 and to validate our conclusions .",
    "we remark that the elaborated approach to fit measured diffuse magnetic neutron scattering to monte - carlo simulations can be easily adapted to other frustrated systems and would be useful in justification of an anticipated hamiltonian .",
    "+ in summary we studied the evolution of magnetic states in @xmath1 polycrystalline samples with temperature and substitution in the b - site .",
    "we observed short - range and long - range order for all compositions . employing monte - carlo simulations we found that for x=0 the system is in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath8=1/8 , where the spiral spin - liquid develops@xcite , but stays in the weakly frustrated limit for x@xmath200 .",
    "we also found that replacement in the nonmagnetic b - site changes the strength of exchange interactions which in turn leads to significant differences in the ordering temperatures and in the extent of the spin - liquid regime .",
