    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is one of the most interesting phenomena in the strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "@xcite vo@xmath0 is well known for its first - order metal - insulator transition at 340 k ,  @xcite which is accompanied by a structural transition . in the high temperature metallic phase it has a rutile structure , while in the low temperature insulating phase ( @xmath1 phase ) the v atoms dimerize along the @xmath2-axis and the dimers twist , resulting in a monoclinic structure .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility changes from paramagnetic to nonmagnetic in going from the metallic to the insulating phase .",
    "hence , this transition is analogous to a peierls transition . in the early stage of the study for the mit in vo@xmath0 , goodenough explained the mit based on a simplified band model .",
    "@xcite the v @xmath3 @xmath4 level is split into the @xmath5 and @xmath6 sublevels due to the tetragonal crystal field .",
    "the @xmath6 bands are hybridized with the o 2_p_@xmath7 bands and are pushed upward .",
    "the @xmath5 band is rather weakly hybridized with the o @xmath8 band and has the lowest energy among the v 3_d _ bands . in the metallic phase ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath5 bands overlap and are partially filled . in the insulating phase , the @xmath6 bands are shifted upward and the @xmath5 band is split into two subbands . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath6 bands become empty and the lower @xmath5 subband is completely filled .",
    "@xcite however , this picture was criticized that only with the lattice distortion the optical gap of 0.6 ev  @xcite can not be reproduced and the importance of electron correlation effect was pointed out based on the cluster calculations .",
    "@xcite zylbersztejn and mott claimed that while the insulating phase can not be described correctly without taking into account of the electron correlation effect , for the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 , the screening effect of the @xmath6 bands on the @xmath5 bands is important .",

    ", cr - doped vo@xmath0 or pure vo@xmath0 under uniaxial pressure in the [ 110 ] direction of the rutile structure has another monoclinic insulating phase called the @xmath9 phase . in the @xmath9 phase ,",
    "half of the v atoms form pairs and the other half form zig - zag chains .",
    "@xcite while the v atoms in the pairs are nonmagnetic , those in the zig - zag chains have local moments and are regarded as one - dimensional heisenberg chains according to an nmr study .",

    "more recently , several theoretical studies have been reported for the mit of vo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , it still remains highly controversial whether the mit of vo@xmath0 is driven by the electron - phonon interaction ( resulting in a peierls insulator ) or the electron - electron interaction ( resulting in a mott insulator ) .",
    "to address this issue , both of the electron - electron and electron - phonon interaction effects should be further investigated . in a recent photoemission study , it is concluded that while the electron - electron interaction is necessary to produce the band gap in the insulating phase , the electron - phonon interaction is important to fully understand the electronic structure and charge transport in vo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite to further understand how these effects are related to the charge transport , it is important to investigate the detailed charge dynamics of vo@xmath0 .",
    "so far , several optical measurements have been reported for vo@xmath0 using bulk samples  @xcite and thin film samples .",
    "@xcite however , spectroscopic measurements are difficult for the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 with the bulk crystals because the crystals break into pieces when it cross the mit",
    ".  @xcite on the other hand , with the thin films , it is difficult to deduce the optical constants precisely from optical measurements because multiple reflections between the film and the substrate should be taken into account .    in this work ,",
    "we report the optical conductivity of vo@xmath0 at various temperatures deduced from the optical reflectivity measurements of tio@xmath0 substrates and vo@xmath0 thin films grown on the tio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "it is observed that a broad drude - like component in the metallic phase transfers to the higher energies around 1.3 ev in the insulating phase . we have also found that the structure around 1.3 ev in the insulating phase shows a temperature dependence similar to the photoemission spectra and considered that this is another evidence for the strong electron - phonon interaction .",

    "when the mean free path is such small , description for the electronic transport by the boltzmann equation may be not valid .",

    "for example , the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) predicts that the spectral function of the half - filled hubbard model has peaks at @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding the lower- and upper - hubbard band , respectively and that the optical conductivity has a peak at @xmath65 in the insulating region .",
