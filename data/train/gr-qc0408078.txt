    "the einstein tensor is the only symmetric and conserved tensor depending on the metric and its derivatives up to the second order , which is linear in the second derivatives of the metric . dropping the last condition , lovelock @xcite found the most general tensor satisfying the other ones .",
    "the obtained tensor is non linear in the riemann tensor and differs from the einstein tensor only if the space - time has more than 4 dimensions .",
    "therefore the lovelock theory is the most natural extension of general relativity in higher dimensional space - times .",
    "the lovelock theory for a particular choice of the coefficients of the action could be thought as the gravitational analogue of born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite .    in the last decades",
    "a renewed interest in both lovelock gravity and born - infeld electrodynamics has appeared because they emerge in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite .",
    "since the lovelock tensor contains derivatives of the metric of order not higher than the second , the quantization of the linearized lovelock theory is free of ghosts .",
    "for this reason the lovelock lagrangian appears in the low energy limit of string theory . in particular , the gauss - bonnet terms ( quadratic in the riemann tensor ) were studied in ref . @xcite and the quartic terms in refs .",

    "then @xmath59 asymptotically , this solution goes to the general relativity solution in five dimensions when @xmath60 , as it is expected .",

    "moreover , it is possible to see that , if one considers the case @xmath77 , the effective cosmological constant in the large @xmath69 limit turns out to be @xmath78    on the other hand , for the case of vanishing cosmological constant ( @xmath53 ) , the solution ( [ solnueva2 ] ) displays an event horizon located at @xmath79 when @xmath80 .",

    "we obtain @xmath85 and , in fact , we will find a similar aspect for the case of the lovelock - born - infeld charged black hole .    if the object has no mass ( @xmath86 ) , one gets de sitter ( @xmath87 ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) solutions ( @xmath88 ) as particular cases ; namely @xmath89 where @xmath90    another interesting geometry is found in the particular case @xmath91 . at this point of the space of parameters ,",
    "the solution ( [ sol ] ) becomes @xmath92 where we have considered @xmath93 , and introduced the notation @xmath94 .",
    "certainly , we could refer to this particular black hole solution as the _ btz branch _",
    ", due to its reminiscence of btz black hole @xcite ; this is an aspect that was already pointed out in ref .",
    "actually , the solution ( [ gaston ] ) shares several properties with the three - dimensional black hole geometry , as the thermodynamical properties which will discussed in section v. indeed , the parameter @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ gaston ] ) plays the role of the mass @xmath96 in the btz solution .",
    "for instance , as well as @xmath97 spacetime is obtained as a particular case of the btz geometry by setting the negative mass @xmath98 , also the five - dimensional anti - de sitter space corresponds to setting @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand , let us notice that , in a consistent way , if the large @xmath45 limit is taken while fixing the condition @xmath100 one finds that the solution becomes the metric which represents the near boundary limit of @xmath101 , like it happens with the _ massless btz _ ( @xmath102 ) which is obtained by making the three - dimensional black hole to disappear .",
    "then , the parallelism with the solutions in @xmath103 turns out to be exact since the five - dimensional metric obtained by keeping only the leading terms in the near boundary limit of @xmath101 corresponds to @xmath104 in ( [ gaston ] ) as well , which is precisely the lovelock black hole solution ( [ sol ] ) with _ minimal _ mass @xmath105 .",
    "besides , a conical singularity is found in the range @xmath106 ( corresponding to @xmath107 ) in a complete analogy .    the @xmath108-symmetry invariance of this particular lovelock solution was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we have shown how the solution ( [ gaston ] ) appears as a particular case of the geometry ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the digression above relies in the fact that , besides the parameter @xmath109 , which classifies the black hole geometry , we have additional parameters characterizing the field theory by means of the couplings @xmath4 of the different contributions @xmath110 in the lovelock lagrangian @xmath111 .",
    "this is the case of the cosmological constant @xmath112 and the gauss - bonnet constant @xmath45 . as an example",
    ", we observed that if one constrains the theory on a particular curve in the space of parameters defined by @xmath113 one finds the particular solution ( [ gaston ] ) .",
    "thus , different regions of the space of parameters ( @xmath114 ) lead to quite different qualitative behaviours of the theory and , consequently , of its solutions .",
    "in 1934 born and infeld @xcite proposed a non - linear electrodynamics with the aim of obtaining a finite value for the self - energy of a point - like charge .",
    "the born - infeld lagrangian leads to field equations whose spherically symmetric static solution gives a finite value @xmath115 for the electrostatic field at the origin",
    ". the constant @xmath115 appears in the born - infeld lagrangian as a new universal constant . following einstein , born and infeld considered the metric tensor @xmath11 and the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath116 as the symmetric and anti - symmetric parts of a unique field @xmath117 .",
    "then they postulated the lagrangian density @xmath118 where the second term is chosen so that the born - infeld lagrangian tends to the maxwell lagrangian when @xmath119 . in four dimensions ,",
    "this lagrangian results to be @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the scalar and pseudoscalar field invariants @xmath123 @xmath124    the born - infeld lagrangian is usually mentioned as an exceptional lagrangian because its properties of being the unique structural function which : 1- assures that the theory has a single characteristic surface equation ; 2- fulfills the positive energy density and the non - space like energy current character conditions ; 3- fulfills the strong correspondence principle . as a consequence of these conditions ,",
    "the lagrangian has time - like or null characteristic surfaces @xcite .    in order to obtain the static spherically symmetric solution in five dimensions",
    ", we will replace @xmath125 and the metric ( [ intervalo ] ) in the born - infeld lagragian ( [ bil ] ) ; then we will vary the action ( this procedure is valid due to the high symmetry of the solution we are looking for ) .",

    "only the diagonal components of the lovelock tensor survive : the components @xmath137 are equal , and they are integrals of the components @xmath138 .",

    "the solution is @xmath142 @xmath143 where @xmath51 is an integration constant .",

    "this limit agrees with the quoted four - dimensional hoffmann solution @xcite with a conical singularity in the origin of the black hole .",
    "consequently , by performing the limit @xmath159 in eq .",
    "( [ limitealfa ] ) we recover the reissner - nordstrm solution in five dimensions with cosmological constant , @xmath160    on the other hand , by taking the limit @xmath161 in ( [ solteo ] ) , we also recover the lovelock - maxwell solution found by wiltshire in @xcite ; namely @xmath162^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] notice that , because to the existence of a birkhoff - like theorem ( see appendix a in ref . @xcite and references therein )",
    ", this limit turns out to be more than a simple heuristical argument to check the solution ( [ solteo ] ) , representing a necessary condition which required to be proved .",
    "we also observe that the uncharged solution ( 11 ) is recovered in the limit @xmath163 .",
    "coming back to the general solution ( [ solteo ] ) , we can see that , differing from schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions , the metric has no singularities ( fig .",
    "[ comparacion ] ) @xmath164     ( lbi ) [ @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath53 , @xmath167 , @xmath168.,width=264 ]    depending on the values of the parameters of the black hole ( charge @xmath67 , mass @xmath109 , born - infeld constant @xmath115 and gauss - bonnet constant @xmath148 ) the square root could be imaginary . if @xmath169 and @xmath170 the solution is valid for all @xmath171 .",
    "if @xmath172 then @xmath173 , so the metric has a conical singularity at the origin : whereas the equator measures @xmath174 , the radius at the equator is @xmath175 . in the critical case @xmath176 one finds @xmath177 and the conical singularity disappears from the metric since in this case @xmath178 when @xmath179 .",
    "conversely , we can think in the critical value @xmath180 as follows : we can define a critical value @xmath181 which represents an upper bound on @xmath67 for the metric ( 24 ) to be well defined in the whole spacetime .",
    "thus , a critical value for the black hole charge appears in this context as a direct consequence of the finite-@xmath115 effects .",
    "the role payed by @xmath115 is setting the critical value @xmath182 in the maxwellian regime @xmath183 , which is consistent with the fact that the lovelock - maxwell black hole geometry is not regular if @xmath184 .    besides , the finite-@xmath115 effects act in ( [ solteo ] ) as a kind of effective cosmological constant @xmath185 , with @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "thus , this fact could lead one to infer that the _ dressing _ of the black hole parameters discussed in section ii can also receive contribution due to the presence of @xmath115 . however , this is not the case , as it can be verified by noting that no @xmath115-dependent quadratic terms in @xmath72 arise when expanding the right hand side of ( [ solteo ] ) .    in this geometry ,",
    "the position of the horizon @xmath188 is defined by @xmath189 , then @xmath190 @xmath191 and thus , for @xmath53 and @xmath192 there is only one horizon . if @xmath193 then the solution is similar to reissner - nordstrm in the sense that there could be two horizons .",
    "when the equality holds one of the horizons is at the origin ( see eq .",

    "and in the reissner - nordstrm case ( rn ) [ @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath53].,width=264 ]    these graphics exhibit the crucial difference existing between the lovelock - born - infeld black hole and the reissner - nordstrm black hole ; namely the fact that for a given charge @xmath67 there exists a finite value for the black hole mass @xmath109 such that the black hole geometry presents only one horizon , because the _ internal _ one reached the origin .",
    "this enhancement of the region bounded by both internal and external horizons is also @xmath115-dependent and represents , by itself , one of the principal distinctions between the black hole geometries in both theories .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ mvsh ] shows how the extremal configuration @xmath197 , which is translated into a complicated expression in terms of the parameters @xmath198 and @xmath115 , experiments a displacement for finite values of @xmath115 with respect to the reissner - nordstrm configuration @xmath199 .",
    "figure [ b1 ] shows different behaviors of the solution @xmath84 for different values of b. this parameter controls the cualitative behaviour close to the origin .",
    "the metric for the subcritical case ( @xmath200 ) is not well defined in the whole spacetime .     for different values of @xmath115 , for @xmath200 : [ @xmath201 , @xmath194 , @xmath166 , @xmath202 , @xmath53 ] , for @xmath203 [ @xmath204 , @xmath194 , @xmath166 , @xmath202 , @xmath53 ] and for @xmath172 [ @xmath205 , @xmath194 , @xmath166 , @xmath53].,width=264 ]",
    "now , let us move to the thermodynamics of the vacuum solution .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole is proportional to the surface gravity @xmath206 and it is given by the formula @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the boltzmann constant . in order to calculate @xmath206 we must evaluate the derivative of @xmath209 in the exterior horizon radius @xmath188 . from the lovelock vacuum solution ( [ solnueva2 ] ) with @xmath53",
    "we obtain @xmath210 .",
    "hence , the surface gravity of the corresponding geometry results @xmath211 and the hawking temperature is given by @xmath212 notice that the temperature goes to zero for bigger black holes ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "this behaviour is the same of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "a remarkable results is that , unlike the schwarzschild case , for small black holes ( @xmath214 or @xmath215 ) the temperature also goes to zero and there would not be hawking radiation ( fig .",
    "[ hawtem ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath156 in equation ( [ temp1 ] ) we recover the general relativity result since , in that case , the temperature is proportional to the inverse of the radius .",
    ", @xmath53].,width=264 ]    the specific heat @xmath216 is given by @xmath217 and , from this , we observe that the position @xmath218 @xmath219 , where the specific heat changes the sign ( fig . [ caloresp ] ) , represents a transition point ( in the fig .",
    "[ hawtem ] this point is the maximum ) .",
    "when @xmath220 the specific heat is positive and the black hole is stable ; while in the range @xmath221 the specific heat is negative and the black hole turns out to be , in this sense , unstable .",
    "the temperature of this transition point is @xmath222 .    ,",
    "@xmath53].,width=264 ]    regarding the entropy of this black hole solution , we make use of the fact that the first law for this non - rotating black hole can be written as usual , @xmath223 where @xmath224 .",
    "thus the entropy results @xmath225    in the limit @xmath156 the entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon , in agreement with the bekenstein - hawking formula . on the other hand , the first term in the equation ( [ entrdeh ] ) is a consequence of the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "it is possible to see that this correction term in the entropy formula is proportional to the integral of the scalar curvature invariant of the horizon @xcite .",
    "this computation confirms , by means of a concise example , the observation derived from hamiltonian methods in @xcite about the fact that the entropy of lovelock black holes is not simply the area formula , but topological invariants also contributes to the whole entropy .",
    "this aspect was also discussed in @xcite .    besides",
    ", by using the stefan - boltzmann law in five dimensions to compute the flux of thermal radiation we can approximately obtain the black hole evaporation time @xmath226 ; namely @xmath227    with the expression for the hawking temperature ( [ temp1 ] ) and integrating ( [ tiempo ] ) one finds that the lifetime of the lovelock black holes turns out to be infinite .",
    "this is due to the linear dependence between the temperature and the horizon radius for small black holes .",
    "hence , these are eternal black holes .",
    "furthermore , we find that the themodynamics of the lovelock black holes in presence of a negative cosmological constant is also consistent with the known results of einstein gravity solutions within the appropriate range .",
    "certainly , the lanczos lagrangian represents short - distance corrections to einstein gravity which start to be relevant at scales comparable with @xmath228 , which we could denominate _ lanczos - lovelock scale_.",
    "conversely , the value of the cosmological constant @xmath112 introduces another length scale , given by @xmath229 , which marks the scales where the cosmological term starts to dominate .",
    "hence , we can identify the range bounded by the maximum and the minimum of fig .",
    "[ temp6 ] as the scales where the results coming from general relativity fit the thermodynamic behaviour of the lovelock solution .",
    "consequently , for very large scales ( large black holes ) the thermodynamic behaviour is well approximated by the ads - schwarzschild black hole solution while the short distance corrections start to dominate at the scale @xmath230 .    ,",
    "@xmath231.,width=264 ]    within this context , we can also notice that the thermodynamical properties of the black hole geometry that appears in the case @xmath100 ( with @xmath93 ) exhibit particular features .",
    "indeed , as we early mentioned , this case is analogous to the btz three - dimensional black hole since the phase diagram involving the temperature and the mass is a monotonic function ( see fig .",
    "[ temp34 ] ) describing a phase such that the specific heat is positive everywhere . in some sense , this case can be considered as a transition and , thus , its stability could be an interesting point to be studied with particular attention .",

    "in this paper we studied a solution ( [ solteo ] ) representing five - dimensional charged black holes in lovelock gravity coupled to born - infeld electrodynamics .",
    "the corrections induced by the quadratic terms in the lagrangian ( gauss - bonnet terms ) correspond to short - distance modifications to general relativity and , therefore , the relevant differences between both theories appear for small radius .",

    "the constant @xmath148 must be positive in order to have a well behaved solution for all value of @xmath72 .",
    "the metric does not diverge at @xmath81 ; for the critical mass @xmath203 the conical singularity , which is characteristic of the hoffmann - born - infeld solution , is removed ( nevertheless , the origin is a curvature singularity ) .",
    "we commented the differences existing with respect to the reissner - nordstrm black holes and , from this analysis , we observed that , unlike the general relativity , the lovelock - born - infeld theory admits charged black hole solutions with only one horizon .",
    "this is due to the fact that for a given charge @xmath67 , there exist values of mass that force the internal black hole radius to reach the origin .",
    "there is another important distinction between the solutions of both theories .",
    "also in contrast to the schwarzschild solution , the temperature of the black hole remains finite ; in particular , we showed that the temperature goes to zero when the horizon radius approximates to the origin , and there is not hawking radiation .",
    "this leads to find an infinite lifetime for lovelock solutions because the short - distance effects render the small black holes stable .",
    "the temperature of the transition point , where the short - distance corrections start to be relevant , is @xmath235 , which corresponds to black holes with a size comparable to the lovelock - lanczos scale , @xmath236 .",
    "we discussed different limits of the solutions in terms of the coupling constant of lanczos lagrangian @xmath45 and born - infeld lagrangian @xmath115 , and we proved that these limits correspond to the expected geometries .",
    "hence , the solution we present here represents a geometry interpolating between the quoted hoffmann metric for einstein - born - infeld theory and the solution found by wiltshire for the case of lovelock - maxwell field theory .",

    "<S> the exact five - dimensional charged black hole solution in lovelock gravity coupled to born - infeld electrodynamics is presented . </S>",
    "<S> this solution interpolates between the hoffmann black hole for the einstein - born - infeld theory and other solutions in the lovelock theory previously studied in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the conical singularity of the metric around the origin can be removed by a proper choice of the black hole parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamical properties of the solution are also analyzed and , in particular , it is shown that the behaviour of the specific heat indicates the existence of a stability transition point in the vacuum solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the similarities existing between this five - dimensional geometry and the three - dimensional black hole . like btz black hole </S>",
    "<S> , the lovelock black hole has an infinite lifetime . </S>"
