    "the recent impressive advances in the field of quantum simulators allowed to probe the many - body physics of strongly correlated systems at the level of the single quantum object . at present cold atoms trapped in optical lattices can be considered among the most promising examples of quantum simulators . by means of ultracold atomic and molecular gases , it is nowadays possible to reach a degree of control and accuracy in engineering the dynamics of many - body systems that were unimaginable in previously . as a consequence , the coherent quantum dynamics emerging from carefully tailored microscopic hamiltonians can now be tested experimentally  @xcite .",
    "it has been possible , just to recall one example , to implement the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model  @xcite and to detect its zero - temperature superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi ) quantum phase transition  @xcite .",
    "other models involving spinor gases , fermi systems , bose - fermi mixtures , or dipolar gases have been also devised and realized , providing an even richer phase diagram ( see for example the review  @xcite ) .",
    "we mention the stabilization of density - wave ( dw ) phases for bosons , as well as more peculiar topological or supersolid orderings , which can arise in the presence of finite - range interactions  @xcite .",
    "more recently a novel kind of many - body quantum simulator has been introduced , based on the idea to use single photons as quantum objects . since photons hardly interact in open space , the most natural way to significantly increase their interactions is to trap them into an optical qed cavity , and couple the field with atoms / molecules inside it in order to create an optical nonlinearity .",
    "if the nonlinearity is sufficiently large , the so called photon blockade sets in  @xcite , namely , the presence of a single photon inside a cavity prevents a second one to enter it . in the rotating - wave approximation ,",
    "the simplest light - matter interaction scheme of this type can be accurately described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model . by arranging an array of cavities coupled through the photon hopping , such to generate a competition between the hopping and the on - site nonlinearities",
    ", one can devise a setup that is well described by the so called jaynes - cummings - hubbard ( jch ) model  @xcite .",
    "in many respects , if one ignores dissipation , the physics emerging from the jch hamiltonian resembles , at low - energies , that of an effective bh model .",
    "probably the main difference between the two systems is that , instead of having neutral bosons as building blocks of the model , in the jch hamiltonian one has to think in terms of polaritons , _",
    "i.e. _ , combined photonic / atomic excitations .",
    "many different works already addressed the jch equilibrium phase diagram with analytical , as well as numerical methods , leading to a fairly complete theoretical understanding of the nature and the location of the emerging phases and phase transitions in terms of the parameters governing the system ( the field has been recently reviewed in , _",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "additional interest in cavity arrays comes from the fact that these systems can be naturally considered as open - system quantum simulators .",
    "some related features have been recently explored  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will not touch on this and consider only the `` equilibrium '' phase diagram .",
    "this intense activity has been very recently boosted by the first experiments on qed cavity arrays  @xcite . as of today",
    ", the most concrete possibility to realize controllable and scalable quantum simulators with cavity arrays involves circuit - qed cavities  @xcite .",
    "so far the coupling between cavities has been mostly considered through photon hopping .",
    "only few works started addressing more general schemes , where the cavity coupling can be induced also by means of non - linear elements  @xcite .",
    "such configurations include cross - kerr interactions and/or correlated hopping terms , which lead to generalizations of the jch model in a way similar to the extended bh ( ebh ) hamiltonian for atoms with large dipole momentum loaded in optical lattices  @xcite . the underlying physical model is believed to possess a much richer structure , with the emergence of exotic phases of correlated polaritons .",
    "it is particularly interesting to address these schemes in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , where interactions become crucial to stabilize exotic phases of matter  @xcite .",
    "these notably include a series of nontrivial density - wave ( dw ) states , which can arise in the strong coupling regime  @xcite , as well as supersolidity and phase - separation effects  @xcite .",
    "extension to consider also counter - rotating terms in the ultrastrong coupling regime , thus leading to the so called rabi - hubbard model  @xcite , have been investigated  @xcite .",
    "however we are not aware of numerical investigations of coupled cavity models beyond the jch and rabi - hubbard model .    in all such situations , non - perturbative , either numerical or analytical calculations",
    "are necessary . here",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm  @xcite has been employed to work out the quantitative zero - temperature phase diagram of the jch model  @xcite .",
    "this is a particularly efficient method for the statics of 1d many - body problems .",
    "its key strategy consists in constructing a portion of the system ( called block ) and then recursively enlarge it . at each step",
    ", the basis of the corresponding hamiltonian is truncated to a given value @xmath1 , so that one can manage the hamiltonian in an effective hilbert space of fixed dimensions , as the physical system grows .",
    "this truncation is performed by retaining the eigenstates corresponding to the @xmath1 highest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of the block .",
    "the aim of this paper is to quantitatively study a generalization of the jch hamiltonian , aimed at taking into account an effective nearest - neighbor nonlinearity between cavities mediated by an @xmath0-type four - level system as discussed for two cavities in ref .",
    "the presence of this coupling leads to an effective cross - kerr non - linearity .",
    "an analysis at the mean - field level of a dissipative open ebh as an effective model for nonlinearly coupled cavities has been performed , unveiling the emergence of novel photon crystal and supersolid phases  @xcite .",
    "here we do not resort to the effective ebh model and analyze the full model as introduced in  @xcite . using the dmrg algorithm ,",
    "we work out the 1d ground - state phase diagram .",
    "we show that a physics similar to the ebh model appears , with a rich phase diagram including gapless sf , as well as mi and dw phases of polaritons .",

    "let us consider a 1d array of qed cavities , where photons can hop between neighboring cavities .",

    "our work is inspired by the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the cross - kerr nonlinearity is generated between two different and neighboring cavities , in circuit - qed systems . in practice , we use the unbalanced couplings of atomic transition @xmath12 with left cavity mode , and @xmath13 with right cavity mode respectively , in order to generate the local ( @xmath4 ) and nonlocal ( @xmath6 ) nonlinearities of our many - body system .",
    "this kind of four - level artificial molecule can be realized using two josephson transmon qubits coupled by a superconducting quantum interference device .",

    "describe the local terms and the nonlinearities on each site . inside the latter brackets ,",
    "the first term is the photon hopping , while the second term describes the coupling of the atom to its right neighboring cavity , which generates an effective nonlocal cross - kerr nonlinearity between the two cavities .",
    "hereafter we concentrate on the 1d model in eq .   at zero temperature , specifically addressing the case without dissipation with dmrg .",
    "let us also fix the hamiltonian quantities in units of @xmath9 , set @xmath18 , and work with open boundary conditions .",
    "we recall that , in the presence of dissipation , the problem becomes much more difficult to be handled numerically  .    for the system we are considering here , in the strong coupling regime atoms and photons",
    "can not be considered as two separate entities .",
    "it is thus natural to investigate the phase diagram in terms of combined atomic / photonic modes , named polaritons .",
    "the polaritonic number operator on each site @xmath19 , representing the number of local excitations , is defined as @xmath20 . for the closed system described by the hamiltonian  , the total number @xmath21 of such polaritons is a conserved quantity . in the following we work in the canonical ensemble for polaritons , and",
    "focus on the integer filling situation .",
    "the different nature of the various phases is sensitive to a number of properties which we are going to focus on .",
    "here we are going to study quantities that resemble those characterizing the various phases of the ebh model  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the ground - state energy gap is an important indicator which characterizes the presence or absence of criticality in the model . in particular , in the critical sf phase , the _ charge gap _ vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . on the other side , in the insulating mi and dw phases",
    ", such gap remains finite . in order to make connection with a similar notation in the ebh model , below we introduce the so called charge and neutral gaps referring respectively to the gaps corresponding to adding one extra particle (  charge \" sector ) or remaining with the same number of particles (  neutral \" sector ) .",
    "we stress however that in the present model the excitation carry no real charge .",
    "this has to be understood only as a convention .",
    "the charge gap is defined as @xmath22 where , in the canonical ensemble , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) denotes the extra energy needed to add ( remove ) one particle , _ i.e. _ one polariton , in the system . in the specific , focusing on the unit filling , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the ground - state energy per site of an @xmath28-sites cavity - array with exactly @xmath28 excitations , and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the corresponding energy per site with one excitation more ( less ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to extrapolate @xmath31 by running three different dmrg simulations with fixed number of polaritons @xmath32",
    "@xcite .",
    "while the charge gap is able to detect particle - hole excitations , in some circumstances it is possible that the dominant low - energy excitations are of a different type .",
    "their presence can be detected only by the so called _ neutral gap _ at a fixed number of particles , @xmath33 where , again working in the canonical ensemble , @xmath34 denotes the first excited energy per site of an @xmath28-site system with @xmath28 excitations .    in the following",
    ", we also focus on the analysis of the staggered diagonal order for the polaritons , in order to distinguish the dw from the other phases .",
    "we do this by investigating the two - point correlation function @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the polariton fluctuation from the average filling @xmath37 .",
    "the order parameter identifying the dw phase is thus given by : @xmath38 .",
    "a finite value of @xmath39 indicates a tendency to establish , in the thermodynamic limit , a staggered occupation of the polaritons . on the other side , in the mi as well as the sf phases ,",
    "@xmath40 vanishes exponentially with increasing distance @xmath41 .",
    "the zero - temperature phase diagram of model  , at unit polariton filling @xmath42 and in the @xmath43 plane , is summarized in fig .",
    "we observe that three different phases can be stabilized .",
    "their boundaries have been obtained by means of a finite - size scaling of the numerical data , for systems up to @xmath44 sites . in our simulations we imposed a cutoff photon number in each cavity ,",
    "such that @xmath45 .",
    "we also truncated the effective hilbert space dimension to a value @xmath46 in all the simulations , except for those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the neutral energy gap ( see the discussion in sec .  [",
    "sec : neutral_gap ] ) .",
    "we checked that , by increasing @xmath1 and the local fock - space truncation over the photon number , the results concerning the charge gap and the dw order parameter do not change on the scales shown here .    for small photon hopping ( @xmath47 ) , by increasing the nonlocal nonlinearity @xmath6",
    "the system exhibits a direct transition from the mi to the dw phase . on the other hand , for @xmath48 , the mi - to - dw transition",
    "is mediated by an extended region appearing at intermediate @xmath6 values , where the system stabilizes into a gapless sf . in the following we are going to elucidate our finite - size scaling procedure and how we were able to distinguish between the different phases .      in the limit of small @xmath6 and @xmath2 values , the dominant presence of the on - site interactions stabilize the system into a mi phase with exactly one polariton per cavity ( @xmath42 ) , and where the charge energy gap has a finite value .",
    "as long as the hopping strength @xmath2 is progressively increased ( and for fixed @xmath49 ) , the system eventually enters a sf phase , with a vanishing gap .",
    "the filled squares of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] denoting the mi / sf boundaries have been obtained by means of a finite - size scaling of the charge gap .",
    "we performed simulations up to @xmath50 sites and analyzed whether the gap closes or remains finite in the thermodynamic limit @xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , left panel , we highlight the size - dependence of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath52 for two points in the phase space close to the mi / sf transition ( see points along the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we expect to see a quadratic dependence @xmath53 ( dashed line ) at large @xmath28  @xcite , however a linear extrapolation ( solid line ) is already a good approximation to the scaling , and we can use it to determine @xmath31 in the thermodynamics limit . indeed , we observe that the difference between quadratic and linear extrapolation is tiny ( @xmath54 ) and does not produce any distinguishable modification on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in the specific case of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we fixed @xmath55 and chose two different values of @xmath56 corresponding to configurations in the gapped mi ( @xmath57 , triangles ) and in the gapless sf phase ( @xmath58 , squares ) .",
    "the mi is signaled by an extrapolated finite value of @xmath59 , while in the sf this is zero .",
    "in order to locate the critical @xmath6 for a given value of @xmath2 ( filled squares in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) we perform a linear extrapolation of the charge gaps in the vicinity of the critical value of @xmath6 .",
    "an example of such procedure is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we plot @xmath31 as a function of @xmath6 , when this is close to the phase transition ( in the specific , here we set @xmath55 ) .",
    "after a linear extrapolation , we get a critical @xmath6 value corresponding to @xmath60 .",
    "an analogous procedure is repeated for all the filled squares shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , thus identifying the mi / sf boundary .",
    "the dw phase is characterized by a finite order parameter @xmath61 .",
    "let us therefore look at the two - point staggered correlator in eq .  .",
    "since in dmrg simulations we are employing open boundary conditions , to minimize the border effects we analyze the correlations in such a way that the two points are taken symmetrically with respect to the center of the system  , with @xmath62 , have been chosen such that @xmath63 for odd r , and @xmath64 for even r",
    "( e.g. for @xmath65 sites , @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 ; @xmath68 corresponds to @xmath69 ; @xmath70 to @xmath71 , and so on ) ] .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows how differently such polariton correlations behave when the system goes from the mi to dw phase , for a fixed system size .    to be more accurate , in the right panel we performed a finite - size scaling and showed that the staggered correlation @xmath72 approaches the zero value exponentially with @xmath28 , in the mi phase ( a similar behavior occurs in the sf region ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the dw such correlator asymptotically converges to a finite value . in the specific ,",
    "here we fix @xmath73 and show that for @xmath74 the dw order is exponentially suppressed with @xmath28 , while for @xmath75 it remains finite .",
    "the @xmath61 order parameter reached for @xmath51 is displayed in the inset as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "in order to determine the dw boundary in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we adopted the following protocol . for a fixed value of @xmath76 , we start increasing @xmath6 from zero up to a finite value , with a fixed increment @xmath77 , and to compute the dw order parameter for all such values of @xmath6 . the boundary of dw phase in the @xmath43 plane ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , for any fixed @xmath2 , is located by the @xmath78 that gives the first non - vanishing order parameter @xmath39 .",
    "here we stress that , because of the arrangement of our 1d array [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] and of the asymmetric coupling between the atom and its right / left cavity , the antiferromagnetic symmetry of the system is spontaneously broken .",
    "in particular , the state @xmath79 of the @xmath28-th atom will be never occupied , since the transition @xmath5 does not couple to any cavity mode [ see eq .  ] . as a consequence , in our simulations",
    "we do not need any symmetry - breaking potential .",
    "we can observe that the expectation value for the onsite number of polaritons explicitly exhibits a staggered behavior , in that the occupation of the @xmath80-th site is always higher than that of the @xmath81-th site ( for any integer value of @xmath82 ) .",
    "finally we notice that such staggering persists at finite size , also for the set of parameters corresponding to the mi phase , although it is extremely tiny and decreases with @xmath28 .",
    "this effect eventually disappears in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the extension of the dw phase depends on the cavity detuning @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the robustness of the order parameter increases with increasing the modulus of the detuning ( see fig .  [ fundelta ] ) .",
    "quite remarkably , we note that a positive @xmath7 will never stabilize an antiferromagnetic dw ordering .      the analysis leading to the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] has been corroborated by a study of the neutral gap , which vanishes both in proximity of the phase transitions and in the entire superfluid region .",
    "differently for the charge gap , it is able to detect the presence of excitations other than particle - hole , and thus locates the boundaries of insulating regions ( as the dw ) beyond the mi .    the data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] show the behavior of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath6 , for a fixed value of @xmath84 .",
    "in particular we analyzed a vertical cut in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( see the rightmost vertical dotted line in that figure ) , where the system can be in three different phases according to the value of @xmath6 . with increasing @xmath6 , it goes from the mi phase ( nonzero @xmath83 , for @xmath85 ) to the sf phase ( zero @xmath83 , for @xmath86 ) , and then to the dw phase ( nonzero @xmath83 , for @xmath87 ) .    while we can not see a clear signature of a finite gap for @xmath88 , the scaling with the size displayed in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] seems to suggest the scenario depicted above .",
    "it is however important to stress that the dmrg simulations needed to compute the neutral gap have to target the two lowest - lying eigenstates in a single run .",
    "thus they generally require a larger dimension @xmath1 of the effective hilbert space , as compared to all the other ground - state calculations discussed before .",
    "the analysis of the neutral gap requires a careful convergence test of the results with @xmath1 , which we provide in the right panel of fig .",
    "we observe that the non monotonic features that are visible in the region @xmath86 have to be probably ascribed to the inaccuracy of the method at small @xmath1 values .",
    "this signals the presence of the gapless sf phase there , in agreement with the results provided by the charge gap ( mi / sf boundary ) and for the dw order parameter ( sf / dw boundary ) .",
    "using the density - matrix renormalization group with open boundary conditions , we studied the equilibrium phase diagram of a system of coupled qed cavities in one dimension .",
    "we provided results beyond the standard model of couplings through photon hopping , and also considered nearest - neighbor cross - kerr nonlinearities .",
    "our analysis is based on a finite - size scaling of the ground - state charge and neutral gaps , as well as of the density - wave order parameter , for systems up to 300 sites .",
    "we showed that , beyond the conventional mott insulator and superfluid phases , the presence of a nearest - neighbor nonlinear coupling can also stabilize a density - wave ordering of polaritons .",
