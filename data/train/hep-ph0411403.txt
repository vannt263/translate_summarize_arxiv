    "the best way to simultaneously measure @xmath3 is the ( golden ) @xmath4 appearance channel @xcite ( and its t and cp conjugate ones ) . unfortunately this measure",
    "is severely affected by the presence of an eightfold degeneracy @xcite .",
    "various methods have been considered to get rid of degeneracies : spectral analysis , combination of experiments and/or different channels . in principle , the eightfold degeneracy can be completely solved if a sufficient large set of independent informations is added . at the cost , of course , of increasing the number of detectors and/or beams and , consequently",
    ", budget needs .",
    "we try to understand here if the effect of degeneracies can be reduced adding informations from both the appearance and the disappearance channels at a single experiment .",
    "we consider as a reference two proposed cern - based facilities : the standard-@xmath5 @xcite and the 4 mwatt spl @xcite .",
    "both neutrino beams are directed from cern toward a 1 mton water cerenkov detector placed in the underground frjus laboratory .",
    "the considered baseline is @xmath6 km .",
    "the average neutrino energy for both beams is @xmath7 mev .",
    "the eightfold degeneracy for these two facilities has been comprehensively studied in @xcite and we refer to those papers for all the technical details and a complete set of bibliographic references .",
    "the considered setup consists of a @xmath8-beam produced by the decay of @xmath9he ions boosted at @xmath10 and of a @xmath11-beam produced in the decay of @xmath12ne ions boosted at @xmath13 .",
    "the average neutrino energies of the @xmath14 beams are 0.37 gev and 0.23 gev , respectively .",
    "the measurement of @xmath3 at this facility has been already actively discussed in the literature @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : appbb ] we plot our results for @xmath15 and two different cp phases : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the input value used in the fit is always shown as a filled black box . throughout the paper we are using the following reference values for the atmospheric and solar parameters : @xmath18 ev@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ev@xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath23% cl contours for each of the degenerate solutions are depicted in the plot assuming a @xmath24% systematic error and are fully explained in the caption .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : appbb ] it can be seen the dramatic impact that degeneracies have in the precision of the measure of @xmath3 : ( 1 ) the error in the @xmath0 measurement is increased by a factor four ( two ) for large ( small ) values of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the presence of degeneracies has a small impact on the ultimate @xmath0 sensitivity ; ( 2 ) the error in the @xmath1 measurement grows in a significant way in presence of the clones , almost spanning half of the parameter space for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "these facts are well understood : being the standard a ( short distance ) counting experiment there are not enough independent informations to cancel any of the degeneracies .    at the the disappearance channel",
    "is also available .",
    "the disappearance probability does not depend on the cp violating phase @xmath1 and the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 measurement , in this channel , is not affected by the intrinsic , octant and mixed ambiguities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : disbb ] we present the disappearance measure for three different systematic errors , namely @xmath26% ( `` theoretical - unrealistic '' scenario ) , @xmath27% ( `` optimistic '' scenario ) and @xmath24% ( `` pessimistic '' scenario ) .",
    "the @xmath26% systematic line represent the ultimate ( error free ) reach of this experiment .",
    "the @xmath27% and @xmath24% lines will cover the optimistic and pessimistic feelings about future improvements in understanding a mton water detector .",
    "the 90% cl contours in the @xmath28 plane are shown for the input values @xmath29 and @xmath18 ev@xmath19 .",
    "the disappearance channel is only slightly sensitive to the sign clone .",
    "in fact , the dependence on the sign of the atmospheric mass difference arises only at @xmath30 . as a consequence",
    "the disappearance channel is an almost `` clone - free '' environment for the , as it is for reactors experiments .",
    "however , even in the case of an optimistic 2% systematic error , no improvement is obtained adding the disappearance channel informations to the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : appbb ] for the appearance channel .",
    "the resulting 90% cl contours practically coincide with the previous ones , and for this reason we do not consider to present them in a separate figure .",
    "the @xmath0 indetermination coming from the clone presence in the appearance channel is smaller than the disappearance error itself . only considering an unrealistic 0% systematics the disappearance channel starts to be useful in eliminating clones .",
    "the considered setup is a conventional neutrino beam based on the 4 mwatt cern spl 2.2 gev proton driver @xcite .",
    "the average neutrino energies of the @xmath31 , @xmath32 beams are 0.27 gev and 0.25 gev , respectively .",
    "the possibility to measure @xmath3 at a standard super - beam facility has been already widely discussed @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : appsb ] we plot our results for @xmath29 and two different cp phases : @xmath16 and @xmath33 .",
    "the input value used in the fit is shown as a filled black box .",
    "the @xmath23% cl contours for each of the degenerate solutions are depicted in the plot assuming a @xmath24% systematic error and are explained in the caption . as it appears from comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : appsb ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : appbb ] , the `` figures of merit '' of a standard @xmath2-beam and the spl super - beam are very similar . also the super - beam appearance channel is severely affected by proliferation of clones .",
    "the precision in measuring @xmath3 is practically identical in the two cases .",
    "this is well explained by the comparable statistics in the golden channel ( @xmath34 vs @xmath35 ) and an almost equal @xmath36 ratio for the two experiments .",
    "there is no real synergy between this two setups and the only effect in summing these two experiments ( concerning the @xmath3 measure ) is to double the statistics .    nevertheless , the great advantage of the facility compared with the one is the possibility to measure directly the atmospheric parameters using the @xmath37 disappearance channel reducing , in particular , the atmospheric mass difference error to less than 10% . in fig . [",
    "fig : dissb ] we show the measure of @xmath38 at the spl with a 2% systematic error for a non - maximal atmospheric mixing , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ev@xmath19 .",
    "the continuous ( dotted ) contour represents the fit to the right ( wrong ) choice of the sign of the atmospheric mass difference .",
    "since we plot the results in the full @xmath41 $ ] parameter space , the octant and mixed clones are automatically taken into account and do not appear as separate regions ( within the considered errors ) . as one can notice the sign ambiguity implies that the errors on the atmospheric mass difference are roughly doubled with respect to what expected in the absence of degeneracies .",
    "the presence of degeneracies in the disappearance channel can be easily understood looking at the the @xmath42 vacuum oscillation probability expanded to the second order @xmath0 and @xmath43 ( see for example @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : totsb ] we present the simultaneous measurement of @xmath3 using both the appearance ( with a 5% systematic error ) and the disappearance ( with a 2% systematic error ) channels at the super - beam .",
    "contrary to the @xmath2-beam case , the disappearance channel introduces in the fit significant changes .",
    "notably enough , the sign clone has disappeared in any case considered .",
    "this is not a surprise as these fits are performed at a fixed @xmath44 : since in the disappearance channel the sign clone manifests itself at a larger value of @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dissb ] ) , in the combination with the appearance channel the tension between the two suffices to remove the unwanted clone in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "notice , moreover , that in some cases the octant clone is considerably reduced or even solved , due to the octant - asymmetric contributions in the disappearance probability .",
    "nonetheless , this does not mean that thanks to the combination of the appearance and the disappearance channels we are indeed able to measure the sign of the atmospheric mass difference .",
    "the mixed clones are generally still present for large values of @xmath0 , thus preventing us from measuring the atmospheric mass difference sign if the @xmath25-octant is not known at the time the experiment takes place .",
    "it is clear that these results should be confirmed by a complete multi - dimensional analysis is underway .",
    "we have tried to understand the impact of disappearance measurements on the @xmath45 ) eightfold degeneracy for the standard-@xmath5 and the spl super - beam .",
    "we presented a complete analysis of degenerations in the and disappearance channels : the disappearance is affected only by a twofold degeneracy , since the probability does not depend on @xmath1 and @xmath25 .",
    "the disappearance is affected by a fourfold - degeneracy .",
    "the inclusion of degeneracies almost double the error on the measure of @xmath44 .",
    "the standard-@xmath5 @xmath2-beam setup looks somewhat limited , being the neutrino energy too low for using energy resolution techniques and the combination with the disappearance , potentially of interest , is in practice useless once a realistic systematic error is taken into account . the idea should be certainly pursued further , but using for example higher @xmath5 options , where should be possible to take advantage of energy resolution and , possibly , the silver channel .",
    "the spl appearance channel is also severely affected by degeneracies . however , in this case the complementarity between the appearance and disappearance channels can be fully exploited even when a realistic systematic error is taken into account . in particular , the sign ambiguity can be strongly reduced as the disappearance sign clone is located at a different @xmath44 .",
