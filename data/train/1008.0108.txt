    "let @xmath0 be infinite dimensional hilbert spaces and @xmath1 a bounded linear operator such that @xmath2 is not closed .",
    "it is well known that under these conditions , the linear operator equation @xmath3 is ill - posed , in the sense that @xmath4 , the moore - penrose generalized inverse of @xmath5 , is not bounded @xcite . the moore - penrose generalized inverse is strongly related to the least squares solutions of ( [ eq:0 ] ) . in fact",
    "this equation has a least squares solution if and only if @xmath6 . in that case",
    ", @xmath7 is the least squares solution of minimum norm and the set of all least - squares solutions of ( [ eq:0 ] ) is given by @xmath8 .",
    "if the problem is ill - posed then @xmath9 does not depend continuously on the data @xmath10 . therefore ,",
    "if instead of the exact data @xmath10 , a noisy observation @xmath11 is available , with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is small , then it is possible that @xmath14 does not even exist and if it does , it will not necessarily be a good approximation of @xmath9 .",
    "this instability becomes evident when trying to approximate @xmath9 by traditional numerical methods and procedures .",
    "thus , for instance , it is possible that the application of the standard least squares approximating procedure on an increasing sequence of finite - dimensional subspaces @xmath15 of @xmath16 whose union is dense in @xmath16 , result in a sequence @xmath17 of least squares solutions that does not converge to @xmath9 ( see @xcite ) or , even worst , that they diverge from @xmath9 with speed arbitrarily large ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ill - posed problems must be first regularized if one wants to successfully attack the task of numerically approximating their solutions .",
    "regularizing an ill - posed problem such as ( [ eq:0 ] ) essentially means approximating the operator @xmath4 by a parametric family of bounded operators @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a regularization parameter . if @xmath20 , then the best approximate solution @xmath9 of ( [ eq:0 ] ) can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the spectral family associated to the operator @xmath23 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is mainly why many regularization methods are based on spectral theory and consist in defining @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a family of functions appropriately chosen such that for every @xmath26 $ ] there holds @xmath27 .    however , it is important to emphasize that no mathematical trick can make stable a problem that is intrinsically unstable . in any case",
    "there is always loss of information .",
    "all a regularization method can do is to recover the largest possible amount of information about the solution of the problem , maintaining stability .",
    "it is often said that the art of applying regularization methods consist always in maintaining an adequate balance between accuracy and stability . in 1994 , however , neubauer ( @xcite ) showed that certain spectral regularization methods `` _ saturate _ '' , that is , they become unable to continue extracting additional information about the exact solution even upon increasing regularity assumptions on it . in his article ,",
    "neubauer introduced for the first time the idea of the concept of `` _ saturation _ '' of regularization methods .",
    "this idea referred to the best order of convergence that a method can achieve independently of the smoothness assumptions on the exact solution and on the selection of the parameter choice rule .",
    "later on , in 1997 , neubauer ( @xcite ) showed that this saturation phenomenon occurs in particular in the classical tikhonov - phillips method .",
    "saturation is however a rather subtle and complex issue in the study of regularization methods for inverse ill - posed problems and the concept has always escaped rigorous formalization in a general context .    in 2001 ,",
    "math and pereverzev ( @xcite ) used hilbert scales to study the efficiency of approximating solutions based on observations with noise ( stochastic or deterministic ) . in this context",
    "it is possible to quantify the degree of ill - posedness and to obtain general conditions on projection methods so that they attain optimal order of convergence .",
    "these concepts were later extended by the same authors ( @xcite ) who studied the optimal convergence problem in variable hilbert scales . in their article",
    "they showed that there is a close relationship between the optimal convergence of a method and the _ `` a - priori '' _ regularity ( in terms of source sets ) for spectral methods possessing qualification of finite order . in 2009",
    "herdman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) introduced an extension of the concept of qualification and introduced three different levels : weak , strong and optimal .",
    "it was shown that weak qualification extends the definition introduced by math and pereverzev ( @xcite ) , in the sense that the functions associated to orders of convergence and source sets need not be the same .    in 2004 , math ( @xcite ) proposed general definitions of the concepts of qualification and saturation for spectral regularization methods .",
    "however , the concept of saturation defined by math is not applicable to general regularization methods and it is not fully compatible with the original idea of saturation proposed by neubauer in @xcite .",
    "in particular , for instance , the definition of saturation given in @xcite does not imply uniqueness and therefore , neither a best global order of convergence .    in this article a general theory of global saturation for arbitrary regularization methods is developed .",
    "it is shown that saturation involves two aspects : on one hand ( just like in neubauer s original idea ) the characterization of the best global order of convergence of the method , and on the other hand , the description of the source set on which such a best global order of convergence is achieved .",
    "also , necessary and sufficient conditions are found for a regularization method to have global saturation . in particular , it is shown that for a method to have saturation , it is necessary that the total error be optimal in two senses , namely as optimal order of convergence over a certain set which at the same time , must satisfy a certain optimality condition with respect to the error .",
    "moreover , an explicit form for the global saturation is given in terms of the family of regularization operators and the operator associated to the problem .",
    "lastly , sufficient conditions are provided for spectral methods with qualification of positive finite order and for spectral methods with maximal qualification to have global saturation .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 convergence bounds for regularization methods",
    "are defined and an appropriate framework for their comparison is developed . in section 3",
    "the concept of global saturation is introduced , its relation with the total error and with convergence bounds is shown and necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of global saturation are provided . in section 4 , a few converse results are proved which , together with the results of section 3 , are used to derive sufficient conditions for the existence of global saturation for certain spectral regularization methods .",
    "in this section we define what we call _ upper bounds of convergence _ for regularization methods and we develop ways of comparing them on the same as well as on different sets .",
    "although this section may seem a little lengthy and tedious at a first glance , it provides a solid mathematical background on which all subsequent formalization and definitions are based upon .    in sequel and for convenience of notation ,",
