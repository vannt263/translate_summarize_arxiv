    "<S> @xcite a simple prescription for the dual is given .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we develop further the proposal of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that it implies an operator renormalization group flow , with the ordinary wilson loop in the uv and the bps loop in the . </S>",
    "<S> further , at strong coupling there is a much larger set of loop operators , with a rich set of rg flows . </S>",
    "<S> these operators do not have any simple weak coupling duals .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that much recent work on scattering amplitudes deals with lightlike wilson loops , @xmath4 , for which the ordinary and bps loops coincide . </S>",
    "<S> however , the loop equations , at least in their usual form  @xcite , take the string out of the space of locally bps configurations  @xcite . making effective use of the loop equations </S>",
    "<S> requires a full understanding of the renormalization of loop operators  @xcite , which is one of the motivations for the preset work .    </S>",
    "<S> we first review and give further support to the prescription of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider the string world - sheet action in nambu - goto form , @xmath5 the vanishing of surface term in its variation requires that @xmath6 on the boundary of the world - sheet . in terms of the @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> coordinates @xmath8 the boundary lies at @xmath9 , or perhaps on a regulating surface @xmath10 . for the bps loop </S>",
    "<S> the embedding is fixed at the boundary , @xmath11 and so the variation  ( [ surf ] ) vanishes trivially .    for the ordinary wilson loop , </S>",
    "<S> the dual theory is given by a world - sheet with boundary conditions  @xcite @xmath12 replacing the dirichlet condition on the angular variables with a neumann condition .. ] these boundary conditions are conformally covariant , @xmath3 \\to w[f(c ) ] \\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath13 invariant . </S>",
    "<S> at weak coupling the gauge holonomy is the unique operator with these properties : conformal covariance implies that it is constructed from the line integral of dimension one operators , and @xmath13 invariance excludes the scalars . as a further symmetry check , we verify in the appendix that the dirichlet condition is locally supersymmetric , and the neumann condition is not </S>",
    "<S> .    one can give a formal derivation by introducing an independent world - line field @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and averaging the loop operator @xmath16 on the world - sheet the sum over dirichlet conditions produces a free boundary condition , giving the neumann condition as an equation of motion . </S>",
    "<S> expanding the loop operator in powers of @xmath17 , the linear term averages to zero , the quadratic term averages to a contour integral of @xmath18 , which is irrelevant , and so on , and only the holonomy survives .    </S>",
    "<S> this is somewhat surprising , because it implies that at large t hooft coupling @xmath19 the expectation values for bps operators with fixed @xmath20 are the same as for the pure gauge operator . </S>",
    "<S> they are governed by the same saddle points , at constant @xmath21 , and differ only in the determinants which give an effect subleading in @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the force between a fundamental and an antifundamental does not depend on whether they couple to a common scalar @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly not true at weak coupling , where the scalar exchange is equal in magnitude to the gauge exchange . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is consistent with some earlier observations . in ref .  @xcite it was noted that the bps loop satisfies zig - zag symmetry  @xcite at strong coupling , whereas this is only expected for the simple loop . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was noted that the ads wilson loop satisfies the same loop equation as in pure gauge theory , and it was conjectured that this is a universal behavior at large @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is another way to think about these two boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> consider a string running radially in @xmath7 , e.g. along @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> its world - volume is an @xmath25 , and the world - sheet fluctuations @xmath26 for @xmath27 are described by massless fields in @xmath25 . near the ads boundary , </S>",
    "<S> one then has @xmath28 the dirichlet quantization sets @xmath29 , and the neumann quantization sets @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these are the standard and alternate quantizations in the sense of refs .  @xcite . near </S>",
    "<S> the ads boundary every world - sheet is asymptotically @xmath25 near any smooth point of the loop @xmath31 , so this reasoning applies more generally </S>",
    "<S> .    consequently , the insertion of @xmath32 into the loop , which should be dual to the boundary perturbation of @xmath26 , has dimension 0 in the ordinary loop ( up to a higher correction  @xcite to be discussed below ) and dimension 1 in the bps loop . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can also be seen from the fact that the insertion of @xmath33 is just an infinitesimal @xmath13 rotation of the loop , and so marginal . using the conformal flatness of the @xmath25 metric @xmath34 we can immediately write down the bulk - to - bulk propagators @xmath35 with the upper sign for the standard quantization and the lower sign for the alternate quantization . </S>",
    "<S> taking the boundary limit @xmath36 gives the @xmath37 two - point function for the standard quantization and a logarithmic two - point function for the alternate quantization . </S>",
    "<S> in the latter case @xmath26 is not a good quantum field due to ir divergences , but its time derivative is . for a closed neumann wilson loop </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 has a normalizable zero mode , whose integral enforces @xmath13 invariance .    </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation immediately suggests an interesting rg flow . </S>",
    "<S> if instead of one of the pure boundary conditions we impose the mixed condition @xmath38 then the @xmath39 term will dominate near the boundary and the @xmath40 term near the horizon : we have an rg flow  @xcite from the ordinary wilson loop in the uv to the bps loop in the . a more precise and @xmath13 invariant way to formulate this is to begin with the neumann theory and add a boundary perturbation @xmath41 on the world - sheet . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath42 has dimension zero in this quantization , this is relevant : it is negligible in the uv and dominant in the . at low energy </S>",
    "<S> the path integral will be dominated by the configuration of minimum action  ( [ j1pert ] ) , extending in the @xmath42 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations around this configuration satisfy the boundary condition  ( [ mixed ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we identify the perturbed world - sheet with the family of operators @xmath43 = \\frac{1}{n } { \\rm tr}\\,pe^{\\oint_c d\\tau \\,(i </S>",
    "<S> \\dot x^\\mu a_\\mu + \\zeta |\\dot x| \\theta^i\\phi^i)}\\ , ,    \\label{zeta}\\ ] ] where here @xmath44 . these interpolate between the ordinary loop at @xmath45 and the bps loop at @xmath46 . that is , @xmath47 , increasing from 0 to 1 as @xmath48 decreases from @xmath49 to 0 ( the renormalization scale is included for dimensions ) . </S>",
    "<S> negative values of @xmath50 give a world - sheet extended in the opposite direction on @xmath51 , and correspond to the range @xmath52 where @xmath53 is again a bps loop . </S>",
    "<S> note that the double - trace interpretation  @xcite of the flow for bulk fields is not relevant here , rather we are inserting additional scalars into the single wilson trace .    </S>",
    "<S> one would expect this flow also to be evident at weak coupling . </S>",
    "<S> expanding perturbatively , power - counting gives a log divergence and so a possible contribution to the running of @xmath54 whenever a group of vertices ( on the wilson contour and/or in the volume ) approach one end of a scalar propagator attaching to the contour . </S>",
    "<S> at order @xmath55 the only graph is fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> , as @xmath56 :        the vertex correction is @xmath57 plus a similar piece from @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> one can evaluate this readily in dimensional regularization , but we will take a spatial regulator , requiring @xmath59 . defining @xmath60 , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the region near @xmath61 is then @xmath62 where we have linearized @xmath63 near @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this exhibits the usual linear divergence proportional to the perimeter , plus a logarithm from the endpoint . </S>",
    "<S> gives a logarithm that must cancel those from the other two ranges . </S>",
    "<S> thus we need calculate only this ` connected ' term , but subtract from its group theory factor the group theory factor of the disconnected graphs . ]    </S>",
    "<S> combined with the integral from @xmath58 , the logarithmic term is @xmath64 at renormalization scale @xmath65 , thus contributing @xmath66 to @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of graphs of order @xmath68 , but we can deduce their contribution indirectly . </S>",
    "<S> the supersymmetric operator @xmath46 should be fixed under renormalization , and so , differing by a factor of 2 . ] @xmath69 more directly , one sees immediately that in feynman gauge the graphs in which the scalar 2 - 3 propagator in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 is replaced by a gauge propagator give precisely the order @xmath70 term in ( [ betazeta ] ) , and we have verified that in this gauge the graph of fig .  2 cancels against the scalar wavefunction renormalization , taking the latter from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> as argued at strong coupling , the @xmath45 simple loop is a uv attractor , and the @xmath71 bps loops are ir attractors .    linearizing near @xmath45 , the dimension of a @xmath72 insertion into an ordinary wilson line is @xmath73 , as compared to 0 at infinite coupling . </S>",
    "<S> linearizing near @xmath46 , the dimension of an insertion of @xmath74 into a bps line in the 6-direction is @xmath75 . at infinite coupling </S>",
    "<S> this dimension is 2 ( the perturbation for the boundary condition flow has dimension @xmath76 at the uv end and @xmath77 at the ir end ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insertion of other @xmath32 into the bps loop has dimension 1 at both weak and strong coupling because it is exactly marginal . </S>",
    "<S> these dimensions have been discussed previously in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the relation @xmath78 does not hold at weak coupling . for bulk fields </S>",
    "<S> this gets only @xmath79 corrections , but for the string world - sheet fields there are corrections in @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have not given a strong - coupling prescription for the loop with @xmath80 , but even at weak coupling this range is problematic : the flow  ( [ betazeta ] ) leads to the bps loop in the ir , but diverges in the uv and there may be no continuum operator . </S>",
    "<S> note that we could also consider complex @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> almost all flows still go to the wilson loop in the uv and the bps loop in the ir , the exception being pure imaginary @xmath54 which diverges in the .    </S>",
    "<S> the fields @xmath81 have @xmath82  @xcite , so @xmath83 and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> the standard quantization corresponds to the insertion of @xmath85  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the alternate quantization should correspond to the fourier transform , the momentum loop of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but the negative dimension is unacceptable : </S>",
    "<S> apparently the fourier transform does not exist at strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> one could regulate this by inserting a factor of @xmath86 , producing a loop that flows to the momentum loop in the uv and to a smeared position - space loop in the . </S>",
    "<S> other such weighted sums over wilson loops have been considered in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they may be useful in disentangling the loop equations .    </S>",
    "<S> it is satisfying to have an ads interpretation for the cft operator @xmath87 $ ] , but there is still a mismatch in the other direction . </S>",
    "<S> one could satisfy the boundary equation  ( [ surf ] ) by taking dirichlet conditions on some of the @xmath88 and neumann conditions on others , say @xmath89 ( note that the constraint @xmath90 is satisfied . ) </S>",
    "<S> this is different from any loop considered above , and the different world - sheet determinants will give a distinct amplitude . like the wilson and bps loops it is conformally covariant , but there is no candidate for a weak - coupling dual .    </S>",
    "<S> to get some insight consider perturbing the neumann theory by the boundary operator @xmath91 the argument again has dimension 0 at strong coupling so this is relevant , and over long distances the loop will want to sit on the 2-sphere @xmath92 where the action is minimized ; the boundary conditions tangent to this @xmath93 remain neumann . </S>",
    "<S> thus , under this perturbation the ordinary wilson loop flows to the loop  ( [ dn ] ) .    at next order in @xmath22 , </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath94 with spherical harmonic @xmath95 has dimension  @xmath96  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one way to see this is to think of @xmath94 as an open string vertex operator , for which the leading dimension is @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> this increases with decreasing coupling , and at zero coupling it reaches the dimension @xmath98 of the insertion @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at some coupling the dimension of @xmath100 passes through  1 , and the perturbation  ( [ j2pert ] ) switches from relevant to irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> the flow then reverses , and the wilson operator is the ir fixed point ( the @xmath101 symmetry prevents the flow from going to the bps loop ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear whether there is any uv fixed point for this reverse flow  the operator with insertion  @xmath102 is perturbatively nonrenormalizable .    </S>",
    "<S> general perturbations @xmath103 define a large set of loop operators at strong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> all flow to the neumann loop in the uv , and functions with a unique minimum flow to the dirichlet loop in the . </S>",
    "<S> potentials with continuous degenerate minima flow to other loops as above . potentials with discrete degenerate minima will flow to a sum over kinked loops . as the coupling is decreased the number of perturbatively renormalizable operators decreases in steps , leaving just the @xmath54-loops  ( [ zeta ] ) at sufficiently weak coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , there should be a parallel story for t hooft loops and d - strings . </S>"
