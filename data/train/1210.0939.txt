    "charm mixing in the standard model is conventionally described by two small dimensionless parameters : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the masses and widths , respectively , of the neutral @xmath19 meson @xmath20 eigenstates , @xmath21 ( @xmath20-odd ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath20-even ) , defined by latexmath:[\\ ] ] these @xmath59 are related to rates of single tags ( st ) , or individually reconstructed @xmath25 or @xmath26 candidates , which are obtained by summing over dt rates : @xmath61 = { \\cal b}_i + { \\cal b}_{\\bar\\imath } = a_i^2 \\left ( 1 + 2 y r_i r_i \\cos\\delta_i + r_i^2 \\right).\\ ] ] here , we have used an expression for @xmath15 in terms of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath47 , which is derived from eqs .",

    "the statistical uncertainties on @xmath15 and @xmath112 are approximately three times smaller than in our previous analysis  @xcite . because of the strong correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath4 , and because @xmath39 is determined by different inputs in the two analyses , a direct comparison of the @xmath4 uncertainties is not instructive .",
    "accounting for correlated uncertainties , the results for @xmath4 in the standard and extended fits differ by @xmath113 .",
    "this difference is caused primarily by the upward fluctuations in @xmath15 and @xmath39 in the standard fit , which are both negatively correlated with @xmath4 .",
    "the above factor of three improvement in @xmath15 and @xmath112 can be attributed in equal parts to the increased size of the dataset and to the additional final states in the current analysis . in particular , the new @xmath114 modes ( including @xmath115 )",
