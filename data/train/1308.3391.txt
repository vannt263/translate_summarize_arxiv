    "solitons are localized and finite energy solutions that are in general non - singular and stable and as such can be seen as models for particles . in the context of relativistic field theories",
    ", solitons are typically classified into two distinct groups , namely `` topological solitons '' and `` non - topological solitons '' .",
    "topological solitons @xcite require degenerate vacuum states .",
    "the topological character of the field is represented by an integer which is called the topological charge .",
    "topological solitons result ( in most cases ) from a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "non - topological solitons , on the other hand , arise in field theories with unbroken continuous symmetries .",
    "examples of non - topological solitons are @xmath0-balls @xcite .",
    "these are made out of scalar fields prevented from collapse by heisenberg s uncertainty principle and repulsive self  interaction .",
    "they carry a non - vanishing noether charge @xmath0 that is globally conserved due to the global u(1 ) symmetry of the model .",
    "@xmath0 can e.g. be interpreted as particle number @xcite . as such",
    ", @xmath0-balls have been constructed in @xmath1-dimensional models with non - renormalizable scalar field potential @xcite , but also appear in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "these supersymmetric @xmath0-balls have been considered as possible candidates for baryonic dark matter @xcite and their astrophysical implications have been discussed @xcite .",
    "the self - gravitating counterparts of @xmath0-balls , so - called `` boson stars '' have also been discussed extensively @xcite . since the discovery of an elementary scalar particle in nature @xcite it is by itself interesting to study these type of objects . even if observations would exclude them to exist they are described by relatively simple equations and could hence act as simple toy models for a wide range of objects such as particles , compact stars , e.g. neutron stars and even centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in boson stars in the context of @xmath2-dimensional gauss - bonnet theory which appears naturally in the low energy effective action of quantum gravity models @xcite .",
    "an important property of gauss - bonnet gravity is that its spectrum does not include new propagating degrees of freedom besides gravitation . in @xmath1 dimensions ,",
    "the gauss - bonnet term is a total derivative so it only contributes to the field equations when it is coupled to a dilaton field . here",
    ", we are only interested in the effect of gauss - bonnet gravity and will hence study these objects in the minimal number of dimensions in which the term does not become a total derivative . in @xcite compact stars consisting of a perfect fluid have been studied in modified models of gravity , including einstein - gauss - bonnet - dilaton gravity in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "let us remark that boson stars are not made out of a perfect fluid since the diagonal spatial components of the energy - momentum tensor are not all equal .",
    "the interest in studying boson stars in higher dimensions is also supported by several other arguments .",
    "first of all , higher dimensions appear in attempts to find a quantum description of gravity as well as in unified models .",
    "examples are kaluza - klein theories and string theory . for black holes it became clear that many of their properties in @xmath1 dimensions do not extend to higher dimensions .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider other localized objects in higher dimensions such as boson stars and see which influence the number of dimensions has on their properties .",
    "@xmath0-balls and boson star solutions of the full system of coupled non - linear equations in @xmath2-dimensional asymptotically flat space - time have been investigated in @xcite and it was indeed found that the behaviour of the solutions depends crucially on the number of spatial dimensions .    also ,",
    "if we add a negative cosmological constant we obtain boson stars in @xmath2-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time and according to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite this theory would correspond to a @xmath1-dimensional strongly coupled conformal field theory on the boundary of ads . as such boson stars have been suggested to be the dual of condensates of glueballs @xcite and their properties in @xmath3 dimensions have been investigated @xcite .",
    "finally , it appears technically simpler to rotate objects in higher dimensions . in the case of @xmath1 dimensions rotating boson stars",
    "are axially symmetric @xcite , so we need to solve partial differential equations , while in @xmath2 dimensions we have two planes of rotation .",
    "if we choose the two angular momenta associated with the two orthogonal planes equal to each other the symmetry of the solutions can be enhanced and `` only '' ordinary differential equations need to be solved @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we give the model , equations of motion as well as the definition of mass , charge and radius of our solutions . in section iii",
    "we discuss our numerical results , while in section iv we conclude .",
    "in this paper we study boson stars in 5-dimensional gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the action reads  : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gauss  bonnet coupling and @xmath6 corresponds to einstein gravity .",
    "@xmath7 is newton s constant in 5 dimensions which is connected to the 5-dimensional planck mass @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the matter lagrangian of the complex valued scalar field @xmath11 which reads  : @xmath12 where the scalar potential reads @xmath13 this potential can be developed into a series as follows @xmath14 in the following , we will use the potential up to 6th order in @xmath11 .",
    "we have checked that the results are qualitatively similar , however , it turns out that the numerics at critical points is easier with a @xmath15 potential .",
    "the gravity equations are obtained from the variation of the action with respect to the metric fields and read @xmath16 where @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the energy - momentum tensor @xmath20 + \\partial_{m } \\psi^ * \\partial_{n } \\psi + \\partial_{n}\\psi^ * \\partial_{m } \\psi   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the variation of the action with respect to the matter field leads to the klein - gordon equation which reads @xmath21 the matter lagrangian @xmath22 is invariant under the global u(1 ) transformation @xmath23 as such the locally conserved noether current @xmath24 , @xmath25 associated to this symmetry is given by @xmath26 the globally conserved noether charge @xmath0 of the system then reads @xmath27      we choose the following ansatz for the metric  : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath31 only and @xmath32 are angular coordinates .",
    "we further choose @xmath33 such that @xmath34 will determine the gravitational mass of the solution .",
    "for the scalar field we choose @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the internal frequency .",
    "in general , boson star solutions exist only in a limited parameter range of @xmath36 .",
    "this parameter range depends on the choice of potential . for our potential ( [ potentialphi6 ] )",
    "we have @xmath37 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we introduce the following rescalings @xmath38 and find that the equations depend only on the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath5 and @xmath39    the equations of motion are @xmath40 @xmath41 for the metric functions and @xmath42 for the matter field function . here and in the following",
    "the prime will denote the derivative with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "these equations have to be solved numerically subject to appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we want to construct globally regular solutions with finite energy . at the origin",
    "we hence require @xmath43 moreover , the scalar field function falls of exponentially with @xmath44 and we hence require @xmath45 , while we choose @xmath46 ( any other choice would just result in a rescaling of the time coordinate ) .      as in most cases considered",
    "so far the scalar field function falls off exponentially in our case .",
    "hence , there are different possibilities to define the `` radius '' of our boson star solutions .",
    "let us remark that models with a v - shaped potential have been considered @xcite that possess compact boson stars with a well - defined outer radius ( very similar to those of `` standard stars'')@xcite .",
    "here we follow @xcite and define the radius of the boson star as an averaged radial coordinate @xmath47    furthermore , the explicit expression for the noether charge reads @xmath48    for @xmath49 we have @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ". then the mass @xmath52 corresponds to the integral of the energy density @xmath53 and reads @xmath54 for @xmath55 the same procedure would lead to the following integral @xmath56 in the following , we will refer to the mass as to the `` inertial mass '' . using the equation of motion ( [ eq_n ] )",
    "this reads @xmath57 clearly , if @xmath50 the inertial mass would be given in terms of @xmath34 .",
    "however , in general , we will have @xmath58 .",
    "we hence define the _ gravitational mass _ to be given by the asymptotic behaviour of the metric function @xmath59 .",
    "as shown in @xcite this procedure can also be applied in the case of gauss - bonnet gravity .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eq_a ] ) - ( [ phi_eq ] ) possess black hole solutions for @xmath60 which implies @xmath50 .",
    "the metric function @xmath61 is then given by : @xmath62 where @xmath52 is an integration constant that corresponds to the mass of the solution .",
    "this is the boulware - deser solution @xcite .",
    "note that for @xmath63 this becomes @xmath64 , which is the tangherlini - schwarzschild solution in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this solution has an event horizon at @xmath65 the gravitational mass of these black hole solutions is given by @xmath66 .",
    "the solutions to the coupled system of nonlinear differential equations are only known numerically .",
    "we have solved these equations using the ode solver colsys @xcite .",
    "the solutions have relative errors on the order of @xmath67 .    in fig.[fig_charge ] and fig.[fig_mass ]",
    "we give the charge @xmath0 and the gravitational mass @xmath68 , respectively , as function of @xmath36 for two different values of @xmath69 and a range of values of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath5 .",
    "we observe that the maximal value @xmath70 up to where the boson stars exist does not depend on the value of @xmath5 and @xmath69 .",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath71 is the thick wall limit with @xmath72 over all space .",
    "hence , details of the gravity model do not matter in this limit .",
    "the thin wall limit , on the other hand , is strongly influenced by the choice of the gauss - bonnet coupling .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig.[fig_charge ] and fig.[fig_mass ] . for small values of @xmath5",
    "we find that the behaviour is similar to the @xmath6 limit of einstein gravity .",
    "the solutions exist down to a minimal value of frequency , @xmath73 , and from there a second branch of solutions exists extending backwards in @xmath36 up to a critical value @xmath74 where a third branch of solutions and consecutively a spiraling behaviour appears such that the charge @xmath0 and the mass @xmath68 are higher on the third branch as compared to the second branch . when increasing the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath5 we find that this spiraling behaviour disappears for @xmath5 large enough .",
    "the actual value of @xmath5 where this happens is hard to determine precisely , but all our numerical results indicate that the larger @xmath69 the larger we have to choose @xmath5 to see the spiraling behaviour disappear . for @xmath5 increasing we then find that the solutions on the second branch exist up to a critical value @xmath74 and that from there a third branch extends backwards in @xmath36 , but this time the charge and mass of the solutions on the third branch is lower than that of the solutions on the second branch .",
    "hence we observe that the `` spiral unfolds '' .",
    "finally , we find that increasing @xmath5 even further we are left with only one branch of solutions .",
    "we show @xmath75 as well as @xmath76 ( which corresponds to the value of @xmath36 where the second and third branch of solutions join ) as function of @xmath5 for two different values of @xmath69 . , width=264 ]    to understand this pattern in more detail , we have also plotted the value of the scalar field function at the origin , @xmath77 , as function of @xmath36 .",
    "our results for several values of @xmath5 are given in fig.[fig_phi0 ] .",
    "for small @xmath5 , we find the spiraling behaviour characteristic for boson stars in einstein gravity with @xmath78 at the center of the spiral in fig.[fig_charge ] or fig.[fig_mass ] .",
    "this latter case corresponds to the thin wall limit with @xmath79 strongly peaked at @xmath80 . for large values of @xmath5",
    "we find that the range of values of @xmath77 is limited .",
    "while @xmath36 tends to smaller and smaller values @xmath77 stays nearly constant .",
    "the larger @xmath5 the smaller is this nearly constant value of @xmath77 .",
    "in other words : as soon as the gauss - bonnet coupling is large enough we can not construct `` thin - wall '' boson stars .",
    "let us remark that the numerical calculations become very tedious at the turning points of the curves and it is difficult to determine the exact values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "however , we have plotted our existing results in order to understand the qualitative pattern of the solutions . in fig.[boson ] we give the value of @xmath73 as well as @xmath74 , which corresponds to the value of @xmath36 where the second and third branch join , as function of @xmath5 for two different values of @xmath69 .",
    "we find that @xmath73 decreases continuously with @xmath5 , while @xmath74 shows a more complicated behaviour .",
    "first the value of @xmath74 increases , but can of course not increase without bound since @xmath81 is the limiting value for @xmath36 up to where solutions can exist .",
    "then @xmath74 shows an oscillating behaviour for intermediate values of @xmath5 and finally decreases . for large enough @xmath5",
    "we find that @xmath74 becomes equal to @xmath73 such that only one branch of solutions exists .    in order to have an idea of the sizes of gauss - bonnet boson stars in comparison to their einstein counterparts ,",
    "we have also computed the radius of these objects using ( [ radius ] ) . in fig.[radius_omega ]",
    "we shown the value of @xmath82 in dependence on @xmath36 for different values of @xmath5 and two values of @xmath69 .",
    "we find that the range of radii possible first increases with increasing @xmath5 with the largest range of possible @xmath82 at @xmath83 , but that then the range of possible @xmath82 is narrowing again until it becomes smaller than in the einstein gravity case for @xmath84 .",
    "here we would like to briefly comment on the physical quantities of boson stars and the relation to neutron stars which we stated above might be well  toy - modeled by the former .",
    "first of all , let us make a connection between the dimensionless quantities used in our paper and the physical values ( indicated by a subscript `` phys '' in the following ) .",
    "the mass and radius are @xmath85 and @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mass of the scalar field in ev and we have taken into account that newton s constant @xmath88 in ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions might have a different value than the one in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions . as indicated in fig.[radius_mass",
    "] we find that the gauss - bonnet boson stars are very dense and exceed e.g. the density of black holes . in some sense",
    "this is not surprising , because our boson stars are non - compact objects without a definite radius beyond which the energy density and pressure become strictly zero .",
    "hence different definitions of the radius can be considered .",
    "however , it is interesting that the mass - radius relation becomes _ unique _ for a sufficiently high gauss - bonnet coupling in the sense that a given radius uniquely determines the mass of the boson star .",
    "this is different in the einstein - hilbert case , where a spiraling behaviour leads to several boson star solutions with different masses existing for one given value of the radius .",
    "neutron stars possess ( in most cases ) a unique relation between the mass and the radius that has to be determined using the equation of state ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , the qualitative features of the mass - radius relation of neutron stars seem to resemble some of the mass - radius relations we obtain for large enough values of @xmath5 ( compare e.g. fig . [ radius_mass ] in this paper and fig.2 in @xcite ) . in @xcite perfect fluid stars in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional einstein - gauss - bonnet - dilaton theory were considered .",
    "the mass - radius diagram looks similar to what we find .",
    "we have constructed gauss - bonnet boson stars in ( 4 + 1)-dimensional space - time and have investigated their properties depending on the coupling constants in the model .",
    "since we were aiming at studying the sole effect of the gauss - bonnet term without taking into account a dilaton ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions is the lowest number of dimensions where this higher gravity term has an effect .",
    "we find that a qualitative change happens when the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath5 is large enough .",
    "while in einstein - hilbert gravity the solutions reach a `` thin wall '' limit with the scalar field at the center of the star diverging , we can not reach a `` thin wall '' limit for @xmath5 large enough .",
    "furthermore , the spiraling behaviour characteristic for boson stars in einstein gravity disappears for @xmath5 large enough and a unique mass - radius relation for the gauss - bonnet boson stars is found .",
    "surely , if we want to compare this to astrophysical objects and promote the idea that boson stars could act as toy models for neutron stars , we would have to study these effects in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "however , this would require an additional scalar field , the dilaton .",
    "it would then be interesting to see whether the qualitative features of the mass - radius relation that resemble those of `` real '' neutron stars will still be present . in @xcite",
    "this was investigated for perfect fluid stars and constraints on the gauss - bonnet parameter were obtained .",
    "it would also be interesting to extend our results to asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time . in the context of the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite planar boson stars in ads have been interpreted as bose - einstein condensates of glueballs @xcite .",
    "however , these solutions have only been considered in einstein gravity which corresponds to the large @xmath29 limit on the quantum field theory side .",
    "hence it would be interesting to take higher order curvature corrections into account .",
    "our model would than holographically describe a strongly coupled quantum field theory away from @xmath89 on a 3-sphere .",
    "this is currently under investigation .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to study the rotating counterparts of our solutions . in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions , rotating boson stars are necessarily axially symmetric and partial differential equations have to be solved . in ( 4 + 1 ) dimensions two orthogonal planes of rotation exist .",
    "if the two angular momenta associated to these planes would be chosen equal , the symmetry of the system can be enhanced and `` only '' ordinary differential equations need to be solved @xcite .",
