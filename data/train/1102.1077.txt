    "<S> the present study deals with locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi type ii cosmological models representing massive string . </S>",
    "<S> the energy - momentum tensor for such string as formulated by letelier ( 1983 ) is used to construct massive string cosmological models for which we assume that the expansion ( @xmath0 ) in the models is proportional to the shear ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this condition leads to @xmath2 , where a and b are the metric coefficients and m is constant . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived two types of models depending on different values of m i.e. for @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . for suitable choice of constant m ( i.e. for @xmath5 ) , it is observed that in early stage of the evolution of the universe , the universe is dominated by strings in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> our models are in accelerating phase which is consistent to the recent observations of type is supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> some physical and geometric behaviour of the models are also discussed .     </S>",
