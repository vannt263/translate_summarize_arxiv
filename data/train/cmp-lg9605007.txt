    "intrasentential antecedents , i.e. , antecedents occurring in the same sentence as the anaphor , are a crucial issue for the anaphora resolution method . the main problem is to determine the constraints that intrasentential phrases must respect in anaphoric relations . these constraints are used to determine relations between a given anaphor and its antecedents . until now , this kind of constraint has been tackled mainly in terms of syntactic aspects , see @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we propose to consider new kinds of criteria that combine semantic restrictions with sentence structure .",
    "one of these criteria is , for example , the way in which the verb meaning influences the sentence structure , then the way in which the sentence structure influences the anaphoric relations between intrasentential phrases .",
    "the structure we studied is the embedded sentence structure .",
    "indeed , an important assumption we have made is that embedded sentences favour the occurrence of intrasentential antecedents .",
    "we exploit the focusing mechanism proposed by sidner @xcite @xcite @xcite extending and refining her algorithms .",
    "the algorithm is designed for anaphors generally , even if we focus mainly on pronouns in this paper .",
    "indeed , the distinction between different kinds of anaphors is made at the level of anaphor interpretation rules .",
    "these resolution rule aspects will not be developed here , though .",
    "they have been developed in the literature , e.g. , see @xcite , and @xcite @xcite .",
    "we focus more on the mechanisms that handle these different kinds of rules .",
    "we first present how intrasentential antecedents occur in embedded sentences .",
    "we recall the main ideas of the focusing approach , then expand on the main hypotheses which led to the design of the anaphora resolution algorithm .",

    "we call such a fact an elementary event ( ee hereafter )",
    ". thus an embedded sentence will contain several ees .",
    "factors that influence embedded sentences are mainly semantic features of verbs .",
    "for example the verb _ to say _ , that takes a sentence complement favours an introduction of a new fact , i.e. , `` to say something '' , and the related fact .",

    "we describe the main elements of the focusing approach that are necessary to understand our method , without going into great detail , see @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "sidner proposed a methodology , modelling the way `` focus '' of attention and anaphor resolution influence one another .",
    "using pronouns reflects what the speaker has focused on in the previous sentence , so that the focus is that phrase which the pronouns refer to .",
    "the resolution is organised through the following processes :    * the expected focus algorithm that selects an initial focus called the `` expected focus '' .",
    "this selection may be `` confirmed '' or `` rejected '' in subsequent sentences .",
    "the expected focus is generally chosen on the basis of the verb semantic categories .",
    "there is a preference in terms of thematic position : the `` theme '' ( as used by gruber and anderson , 1976 for the notion of the object case of a verb ) is the first , followed by the goal , the instrument and the location ordered according to their occurrence in the sentence ; the final item is the agent that is selected when no other role suits . *",
    "the anaphora interpreter uses the state of the focus and a set of algorithms associated with each anaphor type to determine which element of the data structures is the antecedent .",
    "each algorithm is a filter containing several interpretation rules ( ir ) .",
    "+ each ir in the algorithm appropriate to an anaphor suggests one or several antecedents depending on the focus and on the anaphor type .",
    "* an evaluation of the proposed antecedents is performed using different kinds of criteria ( syntactic , semantic , inferential , etc . ) * the focusing algorithm makes use of data structures , i.e. , the focus registers that represent the state of the focus : the current focus ( cf ) representation , alternate focus list ( afl ) that contains the other phrases of the sentence and the focus stack ( fs ) . a parallel structure to the cf",
    "is also set to deal with the agentive pronouns .",
    "the focusing algorithm updates the state of the focus after each sentence anaphor ( except the first sentence ) .",
    "after the first sentence , it confirms or rejects the predicted focus taking into account the results of anaphor interpretation . in the case of rejection",

    "* in a ) the expected focus is `` baseball '' ( the theme ) * in b ) `` it '' refers to `` baseball '' ( cf ) .",
    "`` they '' refers to alfred and zohar ( af ) * the focusing algorithm confirms the cf .",
    "* in d ) `` they '' refers to `` ice cream cones '' in afl . *",
    "the focusing algorithm decides that since no anaphor refers to the cf , the cf is stacked and `` ice cream cones '' is the new cf ( focus movement ) .",
    "we call a basic focusing cycle the cycle that includes :    * the focusing algorithm * followed by the interpretation of anaphors , * then by the evaluation of the proposed antecedents .",
    "the focusing approach always prefers the previous sentences entities as antecedents to the current sentences .",

    "the problem with initial anaphors is that the focus registers can not be initialised or may be wrongly filled if there are anaphors inside the first sentence of the text .",
    "it is clear that taking the sentence in its classical meaning as the unit of processing in the focusing approach , is not suitable when sentences are embedded .",
    "we will focus on the mechanisms and algorithmic aspects of the resolution ( how to fill the registers , how to structure algorithms , etc . ) and not on the rule aspects , like how irs decide to choose _ bill _ and not _ john _ ( sentence 4 ) .",
    "as stated above , embedded sentences include several elementary events ( ees ) .",
    "ees are represented as conceptual entities in our work .",
    "we consider that such successive ees involve the same context that is introduced by several successive short sentences .",
    "moreover , our assumption states that when non - prr anaphors have intrasentential antecedents , they occur in embedded sentences . starting with these considerations ,",
    "the algorithm is governed by the hypotheses expanded below .",
    "first hypothesis : :    : ee is the unit of processing in the basic focusing cycle .    an ee is the unit of processing in our resolution algorithm instead of the sentence . the basic focusing cycle is applied on each ee in turn and not sentence by sentence .",

    "second hypothesis : :    : the `` initial '' ee of a well formed first sentence does not contain    non - prr pronouns just as an initial simple sentence can not .",

    "prr could refer to intrasentential antecedents in simple sentences ( such as in those of sentences 3 and 4 ) .",
    "an initial ee could then contain an anaphor of the prr type .",
    "our approach is to add a special phase that resolves first the prrs occurring in the initial ee before applying the expected focusing algorithm on the same initial ee . in all other cases ,",
    "prrs are treated equally to other pronouns .",
    "this early resolution relies on the fact that the prr pronouns may refer to the agent , as in sentence 3 , as well as to the complement phrases .",
    "however the ambiguity will not be huge at this first level of the treatment .",
    "syntactic and semantic features can easily be used to resolve these anaphors .",
    "this relies also on the fact that the subject of the initial ee can not be a pronoun ( second hypothesis ) .",
    "having mentioned this particular case of prr in initial ee , we now expand on the whole algorithm of resolution .",
    "in the following , remember that what we called the basic focusing cycle is the following successive steps :    * applying the resolution rules , * applying the focusing algorithm , i.e. , updating the focus registers * the evaluation of the proposed antecedents for each anaphor .",
    "the algorithm is based on the decomposition of the sentence into ees and the application of the basic focusing cycle on each ee in turn and not sentence by sentence .",

    "we comment here on the main aspects of the conceptual analysis that are related to the anaphora resolution process .",
    "they concern mainly the way of splitting embedded sentences and the problems of determining the theme and of managing the other ambiguities and the several readings .",
    "the conceptual analyser s strategy consists of a continuous step - by - step translation of the original natural language sentences into conceptual structures ( cs hereafter ) .",
    "this translation uses the results of the syntactic analysis ( syntactic tree ) .",
    "it is a progressive substitution of the nl terms located in the syntactic tree with concepts and templates of the conceptual representation language .",
    "triggering rules are evoked by words of the sentence and allow the activation of well - formed cs templates when the syntactico - semantic filter is unified with the syntactic tree .",
    "the values caught by the filter variables are the arguments of the cs roles , i.e. , they fill the cs roles .",
    "if they are anaphors , they are considered to be unbound variables and result in unfilled roles in the cs .",
    "the anaphora resolution aims therefore at filling the unfilled roles with the corresponding antecedents .",
    "the splitting of a sentence in ee is done on the corresponding cs .",
    "a minimal cs is a template comprising a predicate that identifies the basic type of the represented event and a set of roles or predicate cases .",
    "+ for example , the sentence `` to say that they agree to form a joint venture '' is represented , in a simplified way , with three templates , corresponding to the predicates :    * _ move _ information ( from `` to say '' ) , * _ produce _ an agreement ( from `` to agree '' ) , * _ produce _ a joint venture ( from `` to form '' ) .    given that one template at the semantic level represents an elementary event , the splitting is implicitly already done when these templates are created in the triggering phase .",
    "indeed , the syntactico - semantic filter of the triggering rules takes into account the semantic features of words ( mainly verbs ) for recognising in the surface sentence those that are able to trigger an elementary event .",
    "gruber and anderson characterise the theme as follows : if a verb describes a change to some entity , whether of position , activity , class or possession , then the theme is the changed entity , @xcite and @xcite . as carter",
    "@xcite demonstrated , this definition of gruber and anderson is sufficient to apply the focusing mechanism .",
    "this assumption is particularly apt when we dispose of a conceptual representation . indeed , to determine the thematic roles , we established a set of thematic rules that affect for a given predicative occurrence , its thematic functions according to the predicate type , the role type and the argument s semantic class .",
    "an important aspect appears when one designs a concrete system , namely how to make other disambiguation processes cohabit . in the conceptual analyser ,",
    "the general disambiguation module ( gdm ) deals with other ambiguities , like prepositional phrase attachment .",
    "it coordinates the treatment of different kinds of ambiguities .",
    "this is necessary because the conceptual structures ( cs ) on which the rules are performed could be incomplete because of other types of ambiguities not being resolved .",
    "+ for example , if the cf of the sentence is a pp object that is not attached yet in the cs the thematic rules fail to fill the cf .",
    "the gdm ensures that every disambiguation module intervenes only if previous ambiguities have already been resolved .",
    "the process of co - ordinating ambiguity processing is fully expanded in @xcite .",
    "when dealing with ambiguities , another important aspect is managing multiple readings . at a certain point",
    "when the gdm calls the anaphora module to deal with a given anaphor , the status of the conceptual analysis could be characterised by the following parameters :    * the set of conceptual structures for the current reading ri on which the resolution is performed , given that several readings could arise from previous ambiguity processing .",
    "* the set of conceptual structures of the current sentence si where the anaphor occurs ; * the set of conceptual structures of the current elementary event eei where the anaphor occurs after the si splitting . * the state of the focus ( content of the registers ) , sfi    the main assumption is that the anaphora resolution algorithm always applies to a single state , ( ri , si , eei , sfi ) when resolving a given anaphor ( step 3 ) :    1 .",
    "if several antecedents are still possible after the individual evaluation of the anaphor , ri is then duplicated , in rij , as many times as there are possibilities .",
    "2 .   when performing the collective evaluation of all si anaphors ,",
    "every inconsistent rij is suppressed .",
    "the result is a set of readings ( rij , sj , eej , sfi ) .",
    "we have proposed a methodology to resolve anaphors occurring in embedded sentences .",
    "the main idea of the methodology is the use of other kinds of restrictions between the anaphor and its antecedents than the syntactic ones .",
    "we demonstrated that anaphors with intrasentential antecedents are closely related to embedded sentences and we showed how to exploit this data to design the anaphora resolution methodology .",
    "mainly , we exploited sidner s focusing mechanism , refining the classical unit of processing , that is the sentence , to that of the elementary event .",
    "the algorithm has been implemented ( in common lisp , sun sparc ) to deal with pronouns as a part of a deep analyser .",
    "the main advantages of the proposed algorithm is that it is independent from the knowledge representation language used and the deep understanding approach in which it is integrated .",
    "thus , it could be set up in any conceptual analyser , as long as a semantic representation of the text is available .",
    "moreover sidner s approach does not impose its own formalisms ( syntactic or semantic ) for its application .",
    "the improvment of the proposed algorithm requires dealing with special cases of anaphors such as cataphors and also with specific cases which are not easily handled in the literature .",
    "for example , we saw that a solution to processing cataphors could be to reconsider the order in which the conceptual structures ( elementary events beforehand ) are searched .",
