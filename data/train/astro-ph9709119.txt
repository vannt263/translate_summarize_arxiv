    "luminous asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) were expected to become carbon stars as a result of third dredge - up of carbon to the stellar photosphere .",
    "the absence of carbon stars brighter than @xmath3 mag came therefore as a big surprise ( iben 1981 ) .",
    "hot bottom burning ( hbb : cf .",
    "iben & renzini 1983 ) has been proposed as a mechanism to avoid producing luminous carbon stars by burning the carbon into nitrogen and oxygen before it reaches the stellar photosphere . both third dredge - up and hbb",
    "are poorly understood phenomena , and better observational constraints on the theoretical models are required .",
    "it has been stated that in the lmc there is not only a deficiency of luminous carbon - stars , but a general deficit of agb stars more luminous than @xmath4 mag : where a few hundred are expected , the observed number is a factor ten smaller ( frogel et al .  1990 ; reid et al .",
    "1990 ) .    until recently ,",
    "searches for agb stars in the mcs had been limited to optically bright stars ( e.g.  blanco et al .",
    "1980 ; westerlund et al.1981 ; costa & frogel 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "such stars may evolve further along the agb , changing luminosity , chemical composition and other ( circum-)stellar parameters . on the upper agb they experience heavy mass loss and become enshrouded in dust , making them practically invisible at optical wavelengths and accessible only in the infrared ( ir ) ( see habing 1996 for a review ) .",
    "these obscured agb stars presumably represent the end product of agb evolution , and can be used directly to test the predictions of stellar evolution theories .",
    "they may account for some fraction of the missing luminous agb stars .",
    "the luminous carbon stars , that are absent in samples of optically visible agb stars , might also be found amongst the obscured agb stars .",
    "after the iras satellite opened the thermal - ir window towards the mcs , the first samples of obscured agb stars and red supergiants ( rsgs ) in the mcs were compiled ( whitelock et al .",

    "a total of 46 obscured agb stars in the lmc and 5 in the smc have now been identified , allowing a detailed study of the population of obscured agb stars in the mcs to be made . in this paper",
    "we present the results of an attempt to classify these stars into oxygen and carbon stars , and to study their luminosity distributions .",
    "optically bright agb stars are relatively easy to classify as carbon- or oxygen - rich from low - resolution spectra in the 500 to 800  nm region . in the nir ,",
    "carbon stars are often distinguished from oxygen stars by their @xmath5 colours ( e.g.  feast et al .",
    "these methods do not work for obscured agb stars which are optically too faint , and whose nir colours are more dependent on the optical depth of the circum - stellar envelope ( cse ) than on the effective temperature ( feast 1996 ) . for obscured stars ,",
    "oh maser emission indicates an oxygen - rich cse , but few evolved stars in the mcs have detectable oh masers ( wood et al .",
    "1992 ) and this technique is of limited use in the lmc .",

    "guglielmo et al .  (",
    "1993 ) demonstrated the use of combined near- and mid - ir colour - colour diagrams in isolating carbon stars in the milky way . in papers",
    "ii and iii we confirmed that the @xmath9)$ ] versus @xmath10 or @xmath5 diagram can be used successfully for the mcs .",

    "this filter is centred on the silicate dust feature , which is prominent in oxygen - rich cses .",
    "we chose a scale of @xmath19 per pixel , giving a field of view of @xmath20 . because of the very high background radiation the standard procedure for observing in the thermal ir is chopping and nodding .",
    "we used a chopper throw of @xmath21 , which insured that the source was in all of the frames , thereby increasing the signal - to - noise significantly .",
    "flat - fields were obtained by measuring the flux of a standard star at 13 positions uniformly distributed over the array , and fitting a two - dimensional parabola to the measured values .",

    "the deduced magnitude profile is then compared to that of a standard star . in this way we obtained accurate and reliable magnitude measurements , as well as reliable error estimates .",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitudes are listed in table 1 , along with their 1-@xmath22 error estimates , and the times of mid - exposure .",

    "the @xmath0-band photometry is complemented by near - infrared ( nir ) photometry from a project at saao to monitor dust - enshrouded long period variables ( lpvs ) in the lmc . at this stage , we only derived nir magnitudes and colours for the epoch of @xmath0-band measurement , from the monitoring data as it was available in 1996 march .",
    "the nir magnitudes measured at different epochs were interpolated to obtain estimates for the 1994 november epoch of the @xmath0-band measurement .",
    "the errors on the @xmath12 magnitudes were estimated `` by eye '' .",
    "they depend on the degree to which the light curve is sampled , as well as on the accuracies of the individual measurements .",
    "the @xmath10 colour at the time of the @xmath0-band measurement was estimated by interpolating the @xmath10 colours as they had been measured at the different epochs , rather than interpolating @xmath23 and @xmath12 magnitudes separately and deriving @xmath10 from the interpolated magnitudes .",
    "the two values for the @xmath10 colour were always consistent with each other , indicating a reliable estimation of the accuracies of the estimated individual @xmath23 and @xmath12 magnitudes for the 1994 november epoch of the @xmath0-band measurement .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "for the single epoch nir photometry of iras001657418 we adopted formal errors of 0.3 and 0.1 mag on @xmath12 and @xmath10 respectively , in accordance with the expected variability ( see below ) .",

    "the formal errors include the effects of the faintness of the source , the difference in epochs between the irac2 and timmi observations , the expected amplitude of variability , and the error introduced by the conversion from the irac2 to the saao photometric system .",
    "for iras053487024 we assumed an irac2 @xmath25-band magnitude of @xmath26 , to be able to calculate the transformation to the saao system .",
    "this value has been chosen to be consistent with the expected saao @xmath25-band magnitude ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the error introduced by this assumption will not dominate the error in the derived nir magnitudes .",

    "the presence of a strong oh maser in a mass - losing star is direct evidence that the star is oxygen - rich .",
    "oh maser emission has previously been detected from six luminous agb stars and rsgs in the lmc by wood et al .",
    "their detections , with the parkes 64-m radio telescope with an oh detection level of @xmath28 mjy , suggested that the expansion velocities of oh / ir stars in the lmc are substantially lower than for oh / ir stars in the milky way .",

    "less ir pumping , together with a lower oxygen abundance , may then lead to the low oh maser flux densities of the lmc sources .    in order to test whether oh maser emission could be detected from sources with lower infrared luminosities , we decided to search for oh maser emission at 1612 mhz , in two lmc fields of size @xmath30 square degrees .",

    "the data were corrected for atmospheric amplitude and phase variations using observations of strong nearby continuum sources . to calibrate the flux density scale , the primary calibrator source , 1934638 was also observed .",
    "this was taken to have a flux density of 14.8 jy at 18  cm .",
    "the data were reduced using routines in the aips and miriad radio - astronomy packages . as considerable interference from the russian glonass satellites was present during the observations , the visibility data for the shorter baselines were first edited to remove sections containing strong interference .",
    "glonass interference signals near 1612 mhz are generally detected on baselines below one km .",
    "after removing the interference the data were then fourier transformed to the image plane .      to search for detections we constructed data cubes on the inner @xmath32 of the fields centred on each of the two iras sources , covering a velocity range of 170 to 340 km  s@xmath31 .",
    "each cube consisted of @xmath33 pixels of size @xmath34  km  s@xmath31 .",
    "natural weighting was applied in deriving resolution matched spectra from this cube . in this way we achieved final rms noise levels ( 1-@xmath22 ) of 12  mjy and 6  mjy for the fields on iras044077000 and iras051126755 respectively .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0-band photometry for a sample of 21 dust - enshrouded agb stars in the large magellanic cloud , and three additional sources in the small magellanic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> together with near - infrared photometry , this is used to give a tentative classification into carbon and oxygen - rich atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> bolometric luminosities are also estimated for these stars . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we present the results of a survey for oh masers in the lmc , which resulted in the discovery of oh maser emission from iras044077000 . </S>",
    "<S> spectra between 600 and 1000  nm have been obtained for two heavily obscured agb stars in the lmc , confirming them to be highly reddened very late m - type giants . because the dust - enshrouded stars are clearly undergoing heavy mass loss </S>",
    "<S> they are assumed to be very near the termination of their respective asymptotic giant branch phases . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of mass - losing carbon stars decreases with increasing luminosity , as expected from hot bottom burning . </S>",
    "<S> the best candidate carbon star , with @xmath1 mag , is the most luminous mass - losing carbon star in the magellanic clouds , and amongst the most luminous agb stars . at lower luminosities ( @xmath2 mag ) both oxygen and carbon stars </S>",
    "<S> are found . </S>",
    "<S> this may be explained by a range in metallicity of the individual mass - losing agb stars . </S>"
