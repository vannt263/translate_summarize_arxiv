    "this paper is mainly based on high - precision photometry , and is limited to a sub - sample of stars that are relatively isolated , are well - fit by the psf , and also have small photometric and astrometric errors .",

    "usually , such a large reddening is not uniform across an acs field .",
    "a visual inspection at the cmds of ngc 6397 indeed reveals that the sequences are broadened by differential reddening .",
    "we corrected the effect of differential reddening by means of a procedure that is described in detail in milone et al .",
    "( 2011b ) , and used in many other papers by these authors .    briefly , we define the fiducial ms ridge - line in a given color system for the cluster and estimate , for each star , how the observed stars in its vicinity may systematically lie to the red or to the blue of the fiducial sequence ; this systematic color and magnitude offset , measured along the reddening line , is indicative of the local differential reddening .",

    "the insets of left and middle panel of fig .",
    "[ cmds ] show that the two mss appear to merge close to the turn - off , and that the turn - off / subgiant - branch part of the cmd is narrow and well defined , implying that any age difference between the two populations must be less than a few 100 myrs .",
    "putting a better upper limit on the possible age spread will require a measurement of the overall c+n+o content for the stars in the two populations .",
    "we note that the narrow magnitude distribution of sgb stars rules out the possibility that the double ms could be due to residual spatial variations of reddening that are beyond the sensitivity of the method that we used to correct them , as the reddening line is nearly perpendicular to the sgb sequence .",
    "there is additional evidence that the ms splitting is real .",
    "first of all , the two mss are visible everywhere in the field .",
    "furthermore , reddening would move stars in the same direction in any cmds ( e.  g.  higher reddening would move stars towards redder colors and fainter magnitudes , at odds with the observed behaviour of the msa and msb , which invert their relative position in different cmds of fig .",

    "the red line is the fiducial ridge line of msb .",
    "to determine it , we started by selecting a sample of msb stars by means of a hand - drawn first - guess ridge line , and choosing the stars within a limited color range about this line .",
    "we then calculated the median color and magnitude of msb stars in intervals of 0.2 magnitude in f336w , interpolated these median points with a spline , and did an iterated sigma - clipping of the straightened sequence . to obtain the straightened ms of the middle panel",
    ", we subtracted from the color of each star the color of the fiducial sequence at the f336w magnitude of the star .",
    "the color distribution of the points in the middle panel were analysed in four magnitude bins over the interval 19.6@xmath2320.6 .",

    "even more relevant for the present discussion , l11 analysed the chemical composition of a large number of elements in 21 rgb stars of ngc 6397 , and found that na and o abundances have a bimodal distribution , with about the 75% of stars being enriched in na and depleted in o , while the remaining @xmath025% of the stars have a abundance patterns similar to field stars .",

    "there is a good agreement with the observed color differences in most bands , but a signficant disagreement with the f336w band .",
    "we conclude that helium alone can not account for the observed ms split .",
