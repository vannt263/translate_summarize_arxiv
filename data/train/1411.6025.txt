    "clusters of galaxies usually contain bright elliptical or cd galaxies near their centers .",
    "these galaxies often host a supermassive black hole in their cores .",

    "this agn feedback transports energy and magnetic fields into clusters .",
    "agn contribute to regulating star formation , and limit the total masses of galaxies .",
    "they affect scaling relations in clusters , such as the relationship between x - ray luminosity and temperature .",
    "the icm affects the radio lobes by confining and distorting them .",
    "certain types of radio sources are more often found in clusters than others , and these sources can be used as tools to discover clusters at a wide range of redshifts which can be used for studies of galaxy formation and evolution , as well as cosmology .",
    "bent , double - lobed ( including wide - angle - tail [ wat ] ) radio sources are particularly good tracers for clusters of galaxies at a range of redshifts .",
    "the lobes are likely bent as the result of the relative motion between the radio galaxy and the dense icm which provides ram pressure to bend the lobes .",
    "since these sources are often associated with central cd or giant elliptical galaxies with small peculiar velocities relative to the cluster mean , they may sometimes be found in merging clusters where the icm has been set in motion , or in relatively relaxed systems exhibiting `` sloshing '' of the central icm ( ( * ? ? ?",
