    "such a weakly attractive interaction is sufficient to form cooper - pair - like diquarks in various combinations so that color superconducting phases emerge @xcite .",
    "however , the more quantitative density scale at which such transitions take place can not be predicted .",
    "basically all models of the qcd phase diagram ( briefly summarized in section 2 ) work with dynamical quarks as quasiparticles and do not take into account baryons and their correlations .",
    "an apparently generic result of such models is the fact that the first order transition line at low temperature meets the chemical potential axis at a quark chemical potential around @xmath5 gev , the typical constituent quark mass scale , corresponding to a baryon chemical potential @xmath1 close to the nucleon mass .",
    "this , however , is the terrain of nuclear physics with its enormously rich and well explored phenomenology .",
    "no sign of a first - order chiral or deconfinement phase transition is visible in that area right in the center of the qcd phase diagram .",

    "these symmetries and symmetry breaking patterns serve as guiding principles for constructing models of the qcd phases .",
    "the basic question is about the intertwining of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking with confinement .",
    "the order parameter of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is the quark condensate , @xmath14 .",
    "the disappearence of this condensate , by its melting above a characteristic transition temperature scale , signals the restoration of chiral symmetry in its unbroken wigner - weyl realization .",
    "the transition from confinement to deconfinement in qcd is likewise controlled by an order parameter , the polyakov loop .",
    "a non - vanishing polyakov loop @xmath15 reflects the spontaneously broken @xmath6 symmetry characteristic of the deconfinement phase .",
    "the polyakov loop vanishes in the low - temperature , confinement sector of qcd .",
    "two limiting cases are of interest in this context . in the pure gauge limit of qcd , corresponding to infinitely heavy quarks , the deconfinement transition is established as a first order phase transition with a critical temperature of about @xmath16 mev . in the limit of massless @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks , on the other hand , the isolated chiral transition appears as a second order phase transition at a significantly lower critical temperature .",
    "this statement is based on calculations using nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) type models @xcite which incorporate the correct spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking mechanism but ignore confinement .",

    "once light quarks are added , the @xmath6 center symmetry is explicitly broken by the presence of these quarks and the first - order deconfinement transition turns into a crossover , with a significantly reduced transition temperature around 200 mev .",

    "insights concerning the issue of a possible intertwining of chiral and deconfinement transitions can be gained from a model based on a minimal synthesis of the njl - type spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking mechanism and confinement implemented through polyakov loop dynamics .",
    "this pnjl model @xcite is specified by the following action : @xmath21 - { v\\over t}\\,{\\cal u}(\\phi , t)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it introduces the polyakov loop , @xmath22 with a homogeneous temporal gauge field , @xmath23 , coupled to the quarks .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath15 is controlled by a @xmath6 symmetric effective potential @xmath24 , designed such that it reproduces the equation of state of pure gauge lattice qcd with its first order phase transition at a critical temperature of 270 mev .",

    "earlier two - flavor versions of the pnjl model @xcite have still used a local four - point interaction of the classic njl type , requiring a momentum space cutoff to regularize loops .",
    "a more recent version @xcite , using a non - local interaction between quarks , does not need any longer an artificial njl cutoff .",

    "a basic relation derived in this non - local pnjl model is the gap equation generating the momentum dependent quark mass self - consistently together with the chiral condensate @xmath34 .",
    "its form ( written here for the two - flavor case ) is reminiscent of the corresponding equation emerging in dyson - schwinger approaches to qcd : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the current quark mass , @xmath37 is a coupling strength of dimension ( length)@xmath38 and @xmath39 is a momentum space distribution , the fourier transform of which represents the range over which the non - locality of the effective interaction between quarks extends in ( euclidean ) 4-dimensional space - time",
    ". this non - local approach permits to establish contacts with the high - momentum limit of qcd with its well - known behaviour @xmath40 at @xmath41 . at @xmath42",

    "once the input is fixed at zero temperature by well - known properties of the pseudoscalar mesons , the thermodynamics of the pnjl model can now be investigated with focus on the symmetry breaking pattern and on the intertwining of chiral dynamics with that of the polyakov loop .",
    "the primary role of the polyakov loop and its coupling to the quarks is to suppress the thermal distribution functions of color non - singlets , i.e. quarks and diquarks , as the transition temperature @xmath3 is approached from above .",
    "color singlets , on the other hand , are left to survive below @xmath3 .",

    "the unsuppressed color singlet three - quark degrees of freedom are not clustered but spread homogeneously over all space . at this stage ,",
    "nucleons are not treated properly as localized , strongly correlated three - quark compounds plus sea quarks .",
    "thus one can not expect that such a model describes properly the low - temperature phase of matter at finite baryon chemical potentials around 1 gev , the domain of nuclear many - body systems .",

    "the dashed lines show the chiral condensate for the pure fermionic case and the polyakov loop for the pure gluonic case , respectively . ]    at zero baryon chemical potential , a remarkable dynamical entanglement of the chiral and deconfinement transitions is nonetheless verified in the pnjl model , as demonstrated in fig.[fig3 ] . in the absence of the polyakov loop",
    "the quark condensate ( left dashed line ) , shows the expected chiral crossover transition , but at a temperature way below and far separated from the 1st order deconfinement transition controlled by the pure - gauge polyakov loop effective potential @xmath24 ( right dashed line ) .",
    "once the coupling of the polyakov loop field to the quark density is turned on , the two transitions move together and end up at a common transition temperature around 0.2 gev .",
    "the deconfinement transition becomes a crossover ( with @xmath6 symmetry explicitly broken by the coupling to the quarks ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare this pnjl description of the interplay between the chiral and deconfinement transitions , with a scenario based on strong - coupling lattice qcd with inclusion of polyakov loop dynamics @xcite . although the starting points and frameworks are quite different in those two approaches , recent studies @xcite arrive at similar results concerning the close correspondence between chiral and deconfinement transition temperature ranges .",
    "pions also have a pronounced influence @xcite on the chiral condensate as it approaches the transition region from the hadronic phase .",
    "the chiral crossover becomes significantly smoother close to @xmath3 .",
    "lattice qcd results @xcite with physical pion masses and realistic extrapolations to the continuum limit show a similar tendency .",
    "undoubtedly a prime challenge in the physics of strong interactions is the exploration of the qcd phase diagram at non - zero baryon density , extending from normal nuclear matter all the way up to very large quark chemical potentials @xmath47 at which color superconducting phases are expected to occur .",
    "pnjl calculations at finite @xmath47 give a pattern of the chiral order parameter in the @xmath48 plane showing a crossover at small @xmath47 that ends at a critical point .",

    ". a recent discussion about the possible relationship between such a hypothetical phase and the hadron rates produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite may not yet be conclusive but is pursued with great intensity .",
    "one must recall again at this point that calculations and extrapolations based on pnjl or related approaches still have limited validity at moderate and high baryon densities since they do not properly incorporate baryonic degrees of freedom .",
    "they miss the important constraints imposed by the existence of nucleons and nuclear matter .",
    "this becomes clear when converting the pnjl phase diagram , fig.[fig4 ] , into a plot that translates quark chemical potentials into baryon densities via the derivative of the pressure , @xmath51 , with respect to baryon chemical potential @xmath52 .",
    "the 1st order transition line converts to a broad coexistence region along the density axis that encloses what is well known as nuclear physics terrain , but now described with the ",
    "wrong \" quasiparticle degrees of freedom : pnjl quarks rather than interacting nucleons .",
    "quarks are not the relevant active quasiparticles at low temperature and baryon chemica potentials .",
    "consequently , interpretations based on the schematic phase diagram of fig.[fig4 ] along the chemical potential axis should be exercised with caution .",
    "several further important questions are being raised in this context .",
    "a principal one concerns the existence and location of the critical point in the phase diagram .",
    "extrapolations from lattice qcd , either by taylor expansions@xcite around @xmath53 or by analytic continuation from imaginary chemical potential @xcite , have so far not reached a consistent conclusion .",
    "a second question relates to the sensitivity of the first order transition line in the phase diagram with respect to the axial @xmath32 anomaly in qcd @xcite .",
    "this issue has been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite using a general ginzburg - landau ansatz for the chiral su(3 ) effective action with axial @xmath54 anomaly .",
    "it was pointed out that , depending on details of the axial @xmath32 breaking interaction , a second critical point might appear such that the low - temperature evolution to high density is again just a smooth crossover , or the first order transition might disappear altogether and give way to a smooth crossover throughout . in a three - flavor",
    "njl type realization of this approach @xcite , it has recently been demonstrated how the interaction between chiral condensate and diquark degrees of freedom , based on the genuine @xmath32 breaking six - point vertex , can open up a smooth transition corridor along the chemical potential axis in which chiral and diquark condensates may coexist .     and @xmath55 crossover ) , while the dashed line marks the chiral crossover transition line ( @xmath56 crossover ) ending in the critical point . the chiral first order transition is restricted to a small low - temperature region . ]    interesting developments are presently conducted towards fixing the input of the non - local pnjl model by direct comparison with lattice qcd thermodynamics at imaginary chemical potential @xcite and then studying implications on the phase diagram at real @xmath57 .",
    "a variant of the pnjl approach is the polyakov - quark - meson ( pqm ) model @xcite .",
    "it is based on a linear sigma model with quarks coupled to chiral pion and sigma fields and propagating in a polyakov loop background . combined with renormalization group techniques ,",
    "the pqm model has recently improved in a version @xcite that includes the back - reaction of the quarks at finite @xmath47 on the polyakov loop effective potential . with increasing quark chemical potential , this back - reaction has the effect of aligning the chiral and deconfinement transition borders in the @xmath58 diagram such that these transitions tend to go in parallel not only at small chemical potential , but also as @xmath47 increases .",
    "this important feature is apparent in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "note that the critical point is now moved to low temperature and the chiral first order transition is restricted to a very small region around quark chemical potential @xmath5 gev in the phase diagram .",
    "however , once again , this region corresponds to the density range of nuclear matter where the quark - meson picture is not expected to be valid .",
    "the approach that is , by design and construction , closest to qcd itself is the one based on solutions of ( truncated ) dyson - schwinger equations for quark and gluon correlation functions .",
    "dyson - schwinger thermodynamics has now advanced to the point of producing its generic version of the qcd phase diagram @xcite , as displayed in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "it is again remarkable that the chiral and deconfinement crossovers go jointly in parallel from @xmath59 mev at @xmath60 down to a critical point at @xmath61 mev and @xmath62 mev .",
    "from there on downward a chiral first order transition region is indicated .",
    "mev and around @xmath63 gev , below which the chiral transition becomes first order . ]",
    "what the dyson - schwinger and pqm approaches have in common , however , with the pnjl models is the absence of nucleon formation in the range of densities characteristic of nuclear ( rather than constituent quark ) matter .",
    "the range of quark chemical potentials around @xmath5 gev and low temperatures is nuclear terrain !",
    "the baryon densities @xmath64 determined by the derivative of the pressure @xmath65 with respect to chemical potential , turn out to be in the range @xmath66 fm , covering typical nuclear matter densities .",
    "therefore models and approaches dealing with dynamical ( constituent ) quarks as quasiparticle degrees of freedom in that area can not be correct : it is crucial to take into account the clustering of quarks into nucleons and their correlations in the nuclear medium .",
    "at this point it is now appropriate to turn towards the discussion of nuclear thermodynamics using the framework of chiral effective field theory , the low - energy realization of qcd in its sector with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry . as a starter ,",
    "consider the characteristic scales at work in the ground state of symmetric nuclear matter , i.e. with equal number of neutrons and protons @xmath67 , illustrated in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the nuclear many - body problem displays several  small scales \" compared to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scale , @xmath68 gev . the fermi momentum , @xmath69 @xmath70 , is about half the inverse pion compton wavelength , @xmath71 .",
    "the corresponding average distance between two nucleons , @xmath72 fm , is about 1.3 @xmath73 .",
    "the nuclear compression modulus , @xmath74 mev , is about twice the pion mass .",
    "all these scales are  pionic \" , i.e. of the same order as the pion compton wave length or its inverse .",
    "the only exception is the binding energy per nucleon , @xmath75 mev , an abnormally small number that reflects fine - tuning between short - range repulsion and intermediate - range attraction in the nucleon - nucleon force .    with these observations in mind , it is suggestive that the long- and intermediate - range behavior of the effective interactions responsible for properties of nuclear matter around its equilibrium density can be described by a chiral expansion ( in - medium chiral perturbation theory ) in powers of @xmath76 gev .",
    "short - distance correlations reflect large nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths and should instead be incorporated non - perturbatively by appropriate resummations or through a few contact interactions to be fitted to selected empirical data .    within the last decade",
    "such an approach to the nuclear many - body problem has been developed based on the understanding of the nucleon - nucleon interaction itself in terms of chiral effective field theory @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "chiral one- and two - pion exchange processes in the nuclear medium are treated explicitly while unresolved short - distance dynamics are encoded in contact interactions .",
    "three - body forces emerge naturally and play a significant role in this framework .",

    "in essence , nuclear physics would look radically different if pions were exactly massless nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "the drastic influence of explicit chiral symmetry breaking in qcd through the small but non - zero @xmath17 and @xmath18 quark masses on qualitative properties of nuclear matter is quite remarkable .    .",
    "this plot demonstrates the pronounced influence of the first - order liquid - gas phase transition at low temperatures.,width=321 ]    .",
    "this plot demonstrates the pronounced influence of the first - order liquid - gas phase transition at low temperatures.,width=321 ]    the additional temperature dependence of the in - medium chiral condensate @xcite is found by repeating the calculation , eq.([eq : condensate ] ) , using the free energy density , @xmath131",
    ": @xmath132 the result shown in fig.[fig14 ] demonstrates how the chiral condensate  melts \" with increasing temperature and approaches the linear density dependence of the non - interacting fermi gas at a temperature of about 100 mev . at low temperatures ,",
    "the influence of the nuclear liquid - gas first - order phase transition is visible even in the chiral condensate .",
    "this becomes particularly pronounced when the condensate is plotted as a function of baryon chemical potential @xmath57 ( see fig.[fig15 ] ) .",
    "the effect of thermal pions on the temperature dependence of the quark condensate must still be added ; it amounts @xcite to lowering the magnitude of the condensate by another 5% of its vacuum value at @xmath133 mev .    however , no tendency towards a first order chiral phase transition is visible , at least up to baryon densities about twice that of normal nuclear matter and up to temperatures @xmath134 mev . in that range",
    "it appears that the relevant fermionic quasiparticle degrees of freedom are indeed nucleons rather than quarks .",
    "this should be kept in mind as an important constraint for the discussion of the qcd phase diagram at finite baryon chemical potential .",
    "the equation - of - state of highly compressed cold matter in the center of neutron stars has been an issue and a challenge for many decades . for a long time",
    "it was thought that the vast majority of neutron stars have masses around @xmath135 times the solar mass .",
    "the equation - of - state of neutron star matter that serves as an input for the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equation to calculate the mass - radius relation of the star , @xmath136 , should then be sufficiently  stiff \" in order to support such neutron star masses .",
    "many scenarios for building the cores of such compact stars were designed and discussed @xcite , from conventional nucleonic matter equations - of - state @xcite to matter with more exotic components such as kaon condensates and quark matter @xcite .",
    "the empirical constraints were considerably sharpened recently when a neutron star in a binary with a white dwarf was observed .",
    "an extremely accurate shapiro delay measurement of the pulsar signal resulted in the unusually large mass of @xmath137 in solar mass units @xcite .",
    "this observation rules out some of the softer equations - of - state , e.g. those featuring kaon condensation .    , from ref .",
    "the black solid area is the neutron matter equation of state ( with 10% protons ) calculated using in - medium chiral effective field theory to three - loop order @xcite .",
    "the solid line is the apr equation of state @xcite based on a realistic nuclear many - body calculation . ]",
    "a further important constraint comes from the systematic analysis of a well examined series of neutron stars . using this data base ,",
    "a most probable mass - radius relation @xmath136 has been established @xcite , with a relatively narrow window of star radii around @xmath138 km .",
    "the combination of all these pieces of information can now be used in order to set rather tight constraints for the equation - of - state of dense neutron star matter .",
    "one starts out at low densities with a reliable equation - of - state for the crust of the star and then proceeds to higher densities using a realistic neutron matter equation - of - state based on the chiral effective field theory calculations discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "such an extrapolation holds up to baryon densities of about twice that of normal nuclear matter . the further extrapolation to high densities",
    "is then performed using sections of polytropes , parametrizing the pressure as @xmath139 .",
    "when this is all done one arrives at an equation - of - state , i.e. pressure @xmath140 as a function of energy density @xmath141 , with an uncertainty band determined by the new empirical constraints @xcite .",
    "the result of such an analysis is shown in fig.[fig16 ] .",
    "the condition of supporting a two - solar - mass neutron star implies that this equation - of - state must be quite stiff , with a high - density adiabatic index @xmath142 .",
    "it is remarkable that , at present , the only equation - of - state that meets all constraints mentioned is the one based on standard nucleon degrees of freedom @xcite with realistic nuclear two- and three - body forces . for a more detailed discussion of the implications of such analysis , see ref .",
    "from the variety of existing model calculations ( including those using pnjl models ) one might draw the presumably premature conclusion that critical phenomena in compressed baryonic matter occur already at a density scale not much higher than that of normal nuclear matter . however , these models are so far not capable of working with the proper degrees of freedom around and below baryon chemical potentials @xmath143 1 gev ( corresponding to quark chemical potentials around 0.3 gev ) . approaching the corresponding density scale from below ,",
    "it is obvious that constraints from what we know about the nuclear matter equation of state must be seriously considered .",
    "the implementation of such nuclear matter constraints ( that are well reproduced using the framework of in - medium chiral effective field theory ) into a consistent picture that combines the hadronic sector of the qcd phase diagram with the high - density and high - temperature regions remains a major challenge for the future .",
    "finally , in the discussion of high density , low temperature constraints on the qcd equation of state , recent new developments concerning the mass - radius relation deduced from observations of neutron stars in binaries are of great interest in reducing the set of acceptable equations of state .",
    "in particular , too soft exotic equations of state are most likely ruled out by the existence of a two - solar - mass neutron star , whereas an equation of state with  standard \" nuclear physics degrees of freedom and realistic correlations including three - body forces appears to be consistent with observations .",
    "sincere thanks go to my collaborators nino bratovic , salvatore fiorilla , thomas hell , jeremy holt , norbert kaiser , bertram klein and bernhard rttgers , whose works have contributed substantially to this report .",
