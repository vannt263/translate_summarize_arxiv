    "the problem of the study and measurement of t - odd distributions in hadron - hadron scattering has recently acquired a certain relevance and quite a few related experiments have been thought or scheduled for the next ten years@xcite .    in particular several studies and models",
    "have been proposed for the sivers distribution function@xcite .",
    "its possible existence as a leading - twist distribution was demonstrated@xcite recently , and related@xcite to previously studied t - odd mechanisms@xcite .",
    "some phenomenological forms for its dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been extracted@xcite from available data@xcite .",
    "while studies of general properties@xcite of t - odd functions relate these functions with a wide spectrum of phenomena , quantitative models mostly follow the general scheme suggested in @xcite .",
    "a known quark - diquark spectator model@xcite is extended by including single boson exchange@xcite . in the case of @xcite",
    "the unperturbed starting model was a bag model , and for @xcite a constituent quark model .",
    "here , i want to follow a different approach , that may be of interest in the case of intermediate energy measurements , and that relates single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in inclusive processes with ssa in exclusive processes .",
    "a well measured ssa in an exclusive channel is the normal vector analyzing power measured in elastic proton - proton scattering at energy 20 - 30 gev and @xmath4 @xmath5 1@xmath63 gev / c ( see @xcite ) .    in the energy range 20 - 28 gev , and for @xmath7 near 3",
    "gev / c , this observable is unexpectedly large and roughly energy - independent ( see fig.8 later in this work ) . at energies over 30 gev or @xmath4 over 3 gev / c",
    "it is not measured .",
    "a nonzero analyzing power in @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath8 requires interference between helicity - flip and helicity non - flip amplitudes with 90@xmath10 phase difference ( see e.g. @xcite or @xcite for reviews on this and related points ) . for this reason , in pqcd helicity - conserving processes",
    "this analyzing power must be very small , and the origin of the phenomenon has not yet a commonly accepted explanation .",
    "attempts to explain it may be traced back to ref.@xcite in a non - qcd context . for the region of semihard @xmath4 @xmath5 1@xmath63",
    "gev / c many nontrivial models have been proposed@xcite , but a `` standard '' model , in the sense of a commonly accepted model for this effect , does not exist at present . it must be observed that for some of the previous models ( e.g.@xcite ) the effect should persist at much larger energies than 30 gev , while other ones select a preferential energy range , over which the effect should be suppressed .",
    "the idea underlying the present work is that the interactions producing such an asymmetry are also active in inclusive processes originated by hadron - hadron collisions , at the same energy come and transferred momenta .",
    "in such a case , they could contribute to a nonzero asymmetry of sivers - like kind .",
    "so a scheme can be imagined , allowing for information transfer from elastic proton - proton scattering to proton - proton inclusive processes .",
    "this is attempted in the following .",
    "i do not propose nor adopt any model for the proton - proton elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "but i postulate a general form for a set of amplitudes contributing to this process at quark level .",
    "these amplitudes become initial state interactions in inclusive processes , where their presence admits for a nonzero sivers asymmetry .",
    "the class of processes i want to consider here is the one of ssa in inclusive collisions between an unpolarized proton and a transversely polarized proton .",
    "in particular , azimuthal asymmetries in inclusive production of mesons or ( virtual / real ) photons . for fixed target experiments ,",
    "the kinematics of interest is the one with moderate beam energy 10 - 60 gev , and transverse momentum in the semihard regime 1 - 3 gev / c .    to find nonzero t - odd quantities like the sivers function one needs rescattering interactions between the active quarks and the surrounding particles . in particular , imagining that a hadron - hadron inclusive hard process is triggered by a hard collision between a quark in the projectile hadron ( active quark ) and a parton in the target hadron , this work is centered on the rescattering interactions between the active quark and the target hadron ( initial state interactions , isi ) .",
    "first , i introduce a very simple bound state in light - cone coordinate representation for the active quark in the projectile proton . for this state ,",
    "i speak of `` unperturbed '' bound state , where `` unperturbed '' means that it is not affected by isi with the target hadron",
    ". this state will be a starting point for reproducing both inclusive and exclusive processes .",
    "it is a two - component state ( each component representing positive or negative transverse quark spin ) . in appendix",
    "a it is shown that in ultrarelativistic conditions these two components contain all the relevant independent information on the quark state .    before the hard scattering event",
    ", this state is affected by isi .",
    "the precise form and the parameter values for isi are extracted from the phenomenology of elastic proton - proton scattering in semihard conditions .",
    "i assume that the interactions producing a nonzero analyzing power in proton - proton elastic scattering at the required kinematics may be rewritten in terms of interactions between a projectile quark and a target hadron , where the former is bound to a projectile hadron , and the latter has a continuous structure .",
    "the scheme used for this aim is an ultrarelativistic generalization of the glauber method@xcite .",
    "starting from the fact that the fitted data include unpolarized scattering and single normal spin analyzing power , consideration of the number of constrained amplitudes reduces the considered isi to a sum of scalar and spin - orbit interaction terms , in a 2x2 formalism .",
    "fitting parameters on proton - proton data does not allow for a strict flavor separation .",
    "however , it implies u - quark dominance .",
    "so in the following the expression `` quark interactions '' mainly means `` u - quark interactions '' .    in section",
    "ii , some general definitions are presented and discussed , in particular the definitions of unpolarized quark distribution and sivers - like analyzing power , in terms of empiric variables on the one side and of quark operators on the other side .",
    "also , the quark unperturbed bound state in coordinate representation is introduced .",
    "some related details are put into appendix a section .    in section iii ,",
    "an operator describing isi is introduced . having to modify the above two - component state ,",
    "this operator consists of a 2x2 matrix operator , that is written in eikonal form as the exponential of a set of scalar plus spin - orbit matrices .",
    "i describe and discuss the theoretical foundations and several details of the method allowing me to extract the form and parameters of the isi operator from elastic proton - proton scattering and to apply it to the calculation of inclusive quark distributions .",
    "some details are put into appendix b section .    in section",
    "iv the parameters of the isi operator are fitted to reproduce data on proton - proton elastic scattering at beam energy 20@xmath650 gev and transferred momentum 1@xmath63 gev / c , and mrst@xcite unpolarized u - quark collinear distribution at @xmath11 @xmath5 16 gev@xmath12 .    in section",
    "v the rescattering operator is used to calculate the unpolarized quark distribution , including sivers - like asymmetry , for @xmath2 in the valence region and transverse momenta up to 3 gev / c .",
    "it must be remarked that this work is subject to some limits :    \\1 ) computational limits .",
    "i face stability problems in calculating fourier transforms for transverse momenta over 3 gev / c ( elastic scattering ) or 2.7 gev / c ( inclusive at @xmath2 @xmath5 0.3 ) .",
    "these problems get worse at increasing x , so my analysis centers at @xmath2 @xmath5 0.3 .",
    "this value guarantees that we are in the valence region , and that numerical results are reliable .",
    "\\2 ) limitedness of the data set used for fixing the parameter values .",
    "proton - proton scattering is not the only exclusive process from which information on rescattering in hadron - hadron hard processes may be extracted , although it represents the most complete and precise set of available data in this respect .",
    "\\3 ) twist identification .",
    "the formal apparatus introduced here implies leading twist results at the condition that the key parameters of the interaction operator become energy - independent at large energies .",
    "since there is presently no way to decide how these parameters behave asymptotically , it is not possible to establish whether the found effect is a leading or a higher twist one .",
    "if it is a relevant higher twist , it should become negligible ( compared to leading twist effects ) at energies like 100 gev .",
    "exploiting the fact that the measured analyzing power is energy - independent from 20 to 30 gev , i assume that the considered interactions are relevant in the energy range 10 - 60 gev . for what happens over this range , i can not formulate hypotheses .    here",
    "the terms `` sivers asymmetry '' and `` sivers effect '' are preferred to `` sivers function '' .",
    "the last one is appropriate in the case of a leading twist contribution . to conform with common notation , in the result section",
    "i will name `` sivers function '' a quantity that may be extracted from single spin asymmetries in inclusive processes .",
    "this quantity must be meant as a measured function , whose theoretical interpretation may be and may be not the one of a sivers function .    as a last remark , data and distributions shown in figs .",
    "6 , 7 , and 8 , together with the original references , have been reconstructed thanks to the durham hep database@xcite .",
    "apart for some points where it is clearly specified , all variables will refer to the center of mass of the colliding hadrons .",
    "let @xmath13 @xmath5 @xmath14 be the quark impact parameter and @xmath15 @xmath5 @xmath16 the transverse momentum conjugated with it .",
    "let @xmath17 be the large light - cone component of the hadron momentum , so that @xmath18 is the quark @xmath19 momentum conjugated with @xmath20 .",
    "assuming by default the validity of a standard factorization scheme@xcite , the fourth coordinate @xmath21 plays no role and is fixed to zero .",
    "i substitute @xmath20 with the rescaled coordinate @xmath22 not to work with a singularity of the fourier transform in the infinite momentum limit @xmath17 @xmath9 @xmath23 .",
    "contrary to the ordinary treatment of the problem , where one works on a two - point correlation operator deriving from a set of squared one - point amplitudes , i develop most of the work at the level of one - point amplitudes , square them and then sum over the relevant states .    since the inclusive process is described here in terms of squared amplitudes , and",
    "these amplitudes are calculated before being squared , @xmath24 is not bound to be positive , as it happens in the ordinary treatment based on a two - point correlator with intermediate real states . in that case",
    "@xmath24 has the meaning of the difference between the light - cone positions of two points . in this work",
    "it describes the light - cone position of one of the two only .",
    "i consider a quark inside a hadron with a given spin projection @xmath25 @xmath5 @xmath26 . the quark is supposed to present a nonzero transverse momentum along the @xmath27 direction , and is described by a two - component quark spinor @xmath28",
    "these two components are the components of the full 4-spinor @xmath29 describing a free quark on two 4-spinors @xmath30 , @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are 2-component eigenstates of @xmath35 where the scattering plane is formed by the directions `` z '' ( longitudinal ) and `` x '' ( transverse ) .    in the appendix a section",
    "it is demonstrated ( i ) that in the ultrarelativistic limit the above transverse spinors give a full description of the state of a free quark , ( ii ) that @xmath36 that becomes an equality in the u.r .",
    "the @xmath37projection produces the distribution functions associated to an unpolarized quark with positive @xmath38direction in an infinite momentum frame .",
    "i consider the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) quark distribution @xmath39 of unpolarized quarks in a hadron with @xmath40polarization @xmath26 .",
    "this may be defined in a phenomenological and in a theoretical way .",
    "the phenomenological definition adopted here is in agreement with the so - called `` trento convention '' @xcite , in which the unpolarized quark transverse momentum dependence distribution has the form @xmath41 for an unpolarized quark in a hadron with @xmath42 @xmath5 @xmath43 , moving along the @xmath44 direction .",
    "if the second term is scale - independent , @xmath45 is the sivers function . in the following",
    "i will speak of `` sivers asymmetry '' meaning @xmath46 .",
    "this asymmetry can of course be isolated by calculating the ratio @xmath47/[q_+(k_x)+q_-(k_x)]$ ] corresponding to opposite proton polarizations .",
    "alternatively , one may use the difference @xmath48",
    "@xmath6 @xmath49 for fixed proton polarization .",
    "the result is the same .",
    "so , the center of this work will be the quark distribution asymmetry @xmath50 , defined as    @xmath51    in the following , this inclusive analyzing power of the quark distribution will be simply indicated as `` sivers asymmetry '' , or simply `` asymmetry '' .      on the theoretical side ,",

    "if the average @xmath236spread of the partner distribution @xmath218 is increased from 0.4 gev / c to larger values , the peak asymmetry decreases .",
    "so , the phenomenological effects are expected to depend in a marked way on the specific measurement .    referring to the discussion in point ( 6 ) of subsection 5.1",
    ", it must be remarked that the fact that the found asymmetries decrease for @xmath4 @xmath1 2",
    "gev / c is a necessary consequence of the small ( average ) values of ssa in elastic scattering for @xmath197 @xmath1 1.8 gev / c ( fig.8 ) .",
    "so , in the case of a relevant asymmetry ( over 5 % ) measured at @xmath4 @xmath1 1 gev / c , i would exclude that it may have the origin that is described here .    on the contrary , there are no experimental constraints on the asymmetry values from elastic data at @xmath4 @xmath196 3",
    "gev / c , where more interaction terms could be present , aside of those considered here .",
    "i have adopted a `` minimal '' approach , in the sense of introducing just those interaction terms that are strictly necessary for reproducing the visible data .",
    "so the prediction reported here could underestimate asymmetries on the right side of the peak in figures 10 and 11 .",
    "as previously observed , i do not imagine the term calculated by me to saturate the sivers function .",
    "rather , it is a contribution to it in a well - defined kinematic region . for the following discussion",
    ", i will name `` ab - term '' this contribution .",
    "i will discuss the drell - yan application , since in this case we have some proved factorization statements@xcite , a simple connection with the sidis ( leptoproduction ) case@xcite , absence of final state effects , a reference hard scale @xmath237 ( the dilepton mass ) for @xmath4 , and a connection between the large-@xmath4 and the small-@xmath4 behavior of the sivers asymmetry@xcite .    from figs .",
    "10 and 11 it is evident that the ab - term may be relevant in the region @xmath238",
    "@xmath119 @xmath4 @xmath119 @xmath237 , for reasonable values of @xmath237",
    ". @xmath238 may be any soft scale parameter .",
    "this region has been studied@xcite because here the twist-3 model by refs.@xcite and the sivers function scheme have overlapping regions of consistency .",
    "i name `` semihard @xmath4 region '' the above region .",
    "the previous calculations refer to proton - proton collisions . as far as it can be considered scale - independent ,",
    "the ab - term should be present in sidis too according with the change - of - sign rule stated in @xcite for the leading - twist sivers function .",
    "in drell - yan we have two relevant scales : @xmath237 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is normally admitted@xcite that the sivers asymmetry is power - suppressed in @xmath4 , but the associated sivers function is anyway quoted as `` leading twist '' if it is not power - suppressed with respect to @xmath239 for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath3 . since @xmath237 is related to the squared c.m .",
    "energy @xmath240 via the scaling variables @xmath241 and @xmath242 ( @xmath11 @xmath5 @xmath243 ) `` leading twist '' means that in eq.[eq : sivers ] @xmath45 depends on @xmath240 at most logarithmically ( for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .    in this work @xmath240 is hidden in eq.[eq : glauber1bis ] , in the dependence of @xmath244 on the momentum @xmath104 of the projectile quark ( in a frame where the target hadron is at rest ) this dependence means that the strength parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 in eqs . [ eq : delta_n ] and [ eq : alpha_n ] are in principle functions of @xmath240 .",
    "these parameters are extracted from the data in fig.7 and 8 , so they can be considered as @xmath240-independent if these data do not depend on the beam energy .",
    "the data reported in fig.7 are stable for beam energy 20 - 50 gev , and would show logarithmic changes at larger energies .",
    "those of fig.8 are stable in the range 10 - 30 gev , but we have no similar data at larger energies .",
    "so , i can not presently establish whether the strength of the spin - orbit terms is @xmath240-independent or is not .",
    "if it is , the function shown in fig.10 , with a change of sign , is a contribution to the sivers function in leptoproduction .",
    "if i decided to calculate directly ( with a technique that is reasonably similar to the one adopted here ) the sidis @xmath245 production on proton , this would be the crossed process of @xmath246-proton drell - yan .",
    "for the sivers asymmetry in these two processes the calculation performed within my scheme would respect collins rule ( since the only change between the two cases would be in the integration path for the eikonal factor ) .",
    "however , the calculation of any of these two processes would require additional assumptions , since the elastic data of figs .",
    "7 and 8 only constraint proton - proton isi .",
    "an obvious problem with figs .",
    "10 , 11 is the non regular rise of the asymmetry with respect to @xmath4 . a nonzero ab - term in the semihard region does not exclude the simultaneous presence of a sivers function like those proposed in refs.@xcite filling the soft @xmath4 region where the ab - term is small . indeed , we may have mechanisms that are able to produce a single spin asymmetry in inclusive scattering but become ineffective , or effective but scarcely visible , when applied to elastic scattering .",
    "these mechanisms would escape the presented analysis .    on the other side ,",
    "although nothing in my model forbids a nonzero ab - term at small @xmath4 , it is a matter of fact that , whatever mechanism produces a nonzero analyzing power in elastic scattering ( data in fig.8 ) , this mechanism has its top relevance in the region @xmath4 @xmath196 2 gev / c , and rather small effects at @xmath4 @xmath1 1 gev / c .",
    "so , to invent a model that transforms these small effects , observed in elastic scattering at small @xmath4 , into relevant effects in inclusive processes at the same @xmath4 would not be trivial .    a over - simplified way to reproduce",
    "the physics described in this paper can be to imagine that , before the hard inclusive event , the two colliding protons scatter elastically and remain almost on shell up to the hard event . with respect to the more general process considered in this paper , since it requires re - formation of the proton bound state after isi and before the e.m .",
    "hard scattering .",
    "] we know from the data of fig.8 that after the elastic scattering the space distribution of the colliding protons depends on the normal spin of the initial state .",
    "this is the entrance way to a nonzero sivers asymmetry , since these protons enter the later hard scattering with asymmetric momentum distribution . the same data in fig.8",
    "tell us that this effect is remarkable only when the @xmath4 that is exchanged in the elastic scattering is semihard .",
    "we note that the effect is present also if quarks are completely collinear in the initial state , since what matters is the @xmath4 exchanged in isi .",
    "so one has a physical picture where the typical event characterized by a nonzero ab - term has small `` primordial '' @xmath4 , and a semihard @xmath4 produced in isi .    for the models of the sivers asymmetry in drell - yan that are present in my reference list , we may distinguish two classes :    \\(a ) models where the transverse momentum dependence of the cross section is entirely of fermi motion , `` primordial '' , origin . here",
    "@xmath247 @xmath205 @xmath247 is the sum of the transverse momenta intrinsically associated with the distribution functions of the colliding quark and antiquark .",
    "\\(b ) models where the distribution functions are initially collinear , the @xmath4-dependence of the cross section is associated with the hard nucleon - nucleon interaction ( e.g. gluon radiation accompanying the hard vertex ) and some arguments allow one to stick ( part of ) this effect to the individual quark distributions .",
    "all the models extending the one by @xcite belong to group a. the calculation in @xcite belongs to group b. the model discussed here is mid - way between the two groups : the unperturbed quark distribution is narrow , but not fully collinear ( it has a gaussian tail and transverse range 1 fm ) , and the event numbers at semihard @xmath4 are strongly enhanced by isi . the glauber - gribov approximation allows me to stick this enhancement to the quark distributions . in absence of isi",
    "the curves in fig.9 would be lower in magnitude for @xmath248 over 1 gev / c .",
    "summarizing , starting from the assumption that the quark total angular momentum is dominantly oriented as the parent hadron spin , it is possible to build a nonzero sivers - like asymmetry via mean field initial state interactions of scalar and spin - orbit kind .",
    "the specific form of the interactions , together with the values of the parameters , is here extracted from the phenomenology of proton - proton elastic scattering at 20 - 50 gev .",
    "when these interactions are applied to transverse momentum dependent quark distributions , they produce an asymmetry that is important at transverse momenta 2 - 3 gev / c , and reduces to very small values for smaller transverse momenta .",
    "it is not possible to estimate what happens over 3 gev / c , for the lack of corresponding data in elastic proton - proton scattering .    with the present day knowledge of spin - orbit hadronic interactions , it is not possible to know whether their effects persist at very large energies .",
    "consequently it is not possible to establish whether a sivers - like asymmetry generated by them is a leading twist one or just an intermediate energy effect .",
    "solutions of the dirac equation have in general four independent components .",
    "this is related with the existence of two solutions of the scalar equation @xmath249 and of two independent helicity states for each energy . in the two limiting cases",
    "@xmath250    @xmath251    the structure simplifies .",
    "although the use of a standard 4-component dirac formalism may allow one to exploit a large set of well - known relations for trace calculation etc , it hides the fact that two components only are independent in the ultrarelativistic or nonrelativistic spinors .    writing a 4-spinor in standard representation",
    "as @xmath252 the two 2-spinors satisfy the coupled equations @xmath253 equivalent to the dirac equation .",
    "we have the known nonrelativistic limit @xmath254 @xmath9 0 for particles , and the opposite limit for antiparticles .",
    "this decouples each other spin states , since the second one of eqs.[eq : dirac ] loses relevance , and in the first one the right - hand side may be neglected .",
    "so , only interactions may remix spin states .    as well known , in the opposite limit @xmath85 @xmath224 @xmath255 we have two relevant states @xmath256 that decouple each other .",

    "the correspondence is the opposite .    instead of using helicity basis ,",
    "i write the above equations [ eq : dirac ] in terms of eigenstates of the spin projection along the @xmath153axisaxis and the transverse momentum along the @xmath40axis .",
    "this simplifies intermediate passages if one wants to reproduce oneself the above relations . in the rest of the work i project the spin along the @xmath40axis to conform to ordinary treatments . ]",
