    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 , which have many additional properties such as : invariance under rigid motions , continuity with respect to the hausdorff metric , homogeneity and monotonicity .",
    "note that intrinsic volumes include the volume ( here denoted by @xmath11 ) itself , i.e. the lebesgue measure , which is clearly a valuation .",
    "a celebrated result by hadwiger ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) provides a characterization of an important class of valuations on @xmath5 .",

    "is presented in the monograph @xcite by schneider ( see chapter 6 ) , along with a detailed list of references .",
    "recently the study of valuations was extended from spaces of sets , like @xmath5 , to spaces of functions .",
    "the condition is adapted to this situation replacing union and intersection by `` max '' and `` min '' .",

    "note that the function @xmath37 , identically equal to @xmath38 , belongs to @xmath0 .",
    "this element will play in some sense the role of the empty set .",

    "we are interested in valuations which are rigid motion invariant ( i.e. @xmath50 for every @xmath39 and every rigid motion @xmath51 of @xmath2 ) , and monotone decreasing ( i.e. @xmath52 for every @xmath53 such that @xmath54 point - wise in @xmath2 ) . as @xmath49",

    "how does a `` typical '' valuation of this kind look like ?",
    "a first answer is provided by functionals of type ; indeed we will see in section [ sec integral valuations ] that if @xmath60 is a non - negative decreasing function which verifies the integrability condition @xmath61 then the functional @xmath62 is a rigid motion invariant , monotone decreasing valuation on @xmath0 , which is moreover m - continuous if @xmath33 is right - continuous .",

    "simple_. our first characterization result is the following theorem , proven in section [ characterization results i : simple valuations ] .    [ thm intro 1 ]",
    "let @xmath31 be a valuation on @xmath0 which is : rigid motion invariant , decreasing , m - continuous and simple .",
    "then there exists a decreasing function @xmath33 defined on @xmath34 , left - continuous and verifying , such that @xmath31 can be written in the form .",
    "the proof of this fact is based on a rather simple idea , even if there are several technical points to transform it into a rigorous argument .",
    "first , @xmath31 determines the function @xmath33 as follows : for @xmath27 let @xmath65 be defined as @xmath66 it is straightforward to check that this is a rigid motion and monotone increasing valuation , so that by the volume theorem there exists a constant , which will depend on @xmath67 and which we call @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 as @xmath31 is decreasing , @xmath33 is decreasing too .",
    "now for every @xmath39 and @xmath70 , by monotonicity we obtain @xmath71 this chain of inequalities , and the fact that @xmath31 is simple , permit to compare easily the value of @xmath72 with upper and lower riemann sums of @xmath73 , over suitable partitions of subsets of @xmath40 .",
    "this leads to the proof of .",
    "monotonicity is an essential ingredient of this argument .",

    "formula suggests to consider the more general expression @xmath79 where , for @xmath80 , @xmath9 is the @xmath81-th intrinsic volume and @xmath76 is a radon measure on @xmath34 .",
    "we will see ( still in section [ sec integral valuations ] ) that the integral in is finite for every @xmath39 if and only if @xmath82 ( which is equivalent to when @xmath83 ) and in this case it defines a rigid motion invariant , decreasing and m - continuous valuation on @xmath0 . valuations of type are homogeneous of order @xmath81 in the following sense . for",
