    "this text is devoted to study the asymptotic behaviour of a brownian motion , interacting with its own passed trajectory , so - called `` self - interacting motion '' .",
    "namely , we fix an interaction potential function @xmath1 , and consider the stochastic differential equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a standard brownian motion , with an initial condition of given  @xmath4 ( with the condition of continuity at @xmath5 ) .",
    "this equation can be rewritten using the normalized occupation measure @xmath6 : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the dirac measure concentrated at the point  @xmath9 . using this convention ,",
    "the equation   becomes @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the convolution .",
    "note that the equations  , clearly have singularities at @xmath5 , which is the reason why sometimes they are considered only after some positive time @xmath12 .",
    "we discuss the existence and uniqueness questions for the solution in the appendix .",
    "similar problems have already been studied since the 90 s , for instance by durrett and rogers @xcite , or benam , ledoux and raimond @xcite , initially to modelize the evolution of polymers or ants .",
    "the first time - continuous self - interacting processes have been introduced by durrett and rogers @xcite under the name of  brownian polymers \" .",
    "they are solutions to sdes of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a standard brownian motion and @xmath15 a given function .",
    "we remark that , in the latter equation , the drift term is given by the non - normalized measure @xmath16 and not by @xmath6 as the process we will study here . as the process @xmath17 evolves in an environment changing with its past trajectory , this sde defines a self - interacting diffusion , which can be either self - repelling or self - attracting , depending on the function @xmath15 . in any dimension , durrett & rogers",
    "obtained that the upper limit of @xmath18 does not exceed a deterministic constant whenever @xmath15 has a compact support .",
    "nevertheless , very few results are known as soon as the interaction is not self - attracting .",
    "self - interacting diffusions , with dependence on the ( convoled ) empirical measure @xmath19 , have been considered since the work of benam , ledoux & raimond @xcite .",
    "a great difference between these diffusions and brownian polymers is that the drift term is divided by @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that the long - time away interaction is less important than the near - time interaction ( the interaction is not `` uniform in time '' anymore ) .",
    "benam et al .",
    "have shown in @xcite that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath6 can be related to the analysis of some deterministic dynamical flow defined on the space of the borel probability measures .",
    "afterwards , one can go further in this study and give sufficient conditions for the a.s .",
    "convergence of the empirical measure .",
    "it happens that , with a symmetric interaction , @xmath6 converges a.s . to a local minimum of a nonlinear free energy functional ( each local minimum having a positive probability to be chosen ) , this free energy being a lyapunov function for the deterministic flow .",
    "these results are valid for a compact manifold .",
    "part of them have recently been generalized to @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) assuming a confinement potential satisfying some conditions  these hypotheses on the confinement potential are required since in general the process can be transient , and is thus very difficult to analyze . in these works , no rate of convergence is obtained .",
    "most of these results are summarized in a recent survey of pemantle @xcite , which also includes self - interacting random walks .",
    "coming back to the process introduced by durrett & rogers , all the results obtained have in common that the drift may overcome the noise , so that the randomness of the process is  controlled \" . to illustrate that , let us mention , for the same model of durrett & rogers , the case of a repulsive and compactly supported function @xmath15 , that was conjectured in @xcite and has been partially solved very recently by tarrs , tth and valk @xcite :    suppose that @xmath22 is an odd function of compact support , such that @xmath23 .",
    "then , for the process @xmath24 defined by  , the quotient @xmath25 converges a.s . to 0 .    in  , the drift term is divided by @xmath20 , and so it is bounded for a compactly supported interaction @xmath26 . as for the process of the conjecture ,",
    "the interaction potential is in general not strong enough for the process   to be recurrent , and the behaviour is then very difficult to analyze . in particular , it is hard to predict the relative importance of the drift term ( in competition with the brownian motion ) in the evolution .    on the other hand , in our case of uniformly convex @xmath26",
    ", the interaction potential is attractive enough for the diffusion ( a bit modified ) to be comparable to an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , what gives an access to its ergodic behaviour .",
    "another problem , related to the one considered in this paper , is the diffusion corresponding to mackean and vlasov s pde .",
    "namely , consider the markov process defined by the sde @xmath27 where @xmath28 stands for the _ law _ of @xmath29 , and @xmath26 is a smooth strictly uniformly convex function .    the questions of the asymptotic law for @xmath30",
    "have been intensively studied these last years , by carrillo , maccann & villani  @xcite , bolley , guillin & villani  @xcite , or cattiaux , guillin & malrieu  @xcite for instance .",
    "it turns out that , under some assumptions , the laws @xmath28 converge to the limit measure @xmath31 .",
    "this measure is characterized as a fixed point of a map @xmath32 associating to a measure @xmath33 the probability measure @xmath34 which is the stationary measure of the process , with @xmath28 in the right - hand side of   replaced by @xmath33 and @xmath35 is the normalization constant .",
    "in particular , carrillo , maccann & villani  @xcite have shown , using some mass transport tools , that the relative free energy corresponding to  @xmath28 with respect to  @xmath31 decreases exponentially fast to 0 .",
    "then talagrand s inequality allows to compare the relative free energy to the wasserstein distance in case of uniform convexity of the interaction potential @xmath26 , and so they have obtained the decrease to 0 of the quadratic wasserstein distance between  @xmath28 and  @xmath31 .",
    "we remark that a huge difference between the preceding markov process and the ( non - markov ) self - interacting diffusion is that the asymptotic @xmath36-algebra is in general not trivial for the non - markov process .",
    "nevertheless , we will use a similar mass transport method to show the convergence of the empirical measure @xmath6 .",
    "our results are analogous to those of carrillo et al .",
    "@xcite : under some assumptions imposed on the interaction potential  @xmath26 , we show that the empirical measure  @xmath6 almost surely converges to an equilibrium state , which is unique up to translation :    [ t : main ] suppose , that @xmath37 , and :    * [ i : thma1 ] spherical symmetric : @xmath38 ; * [ i : thma2 ] uniformly convex : denoting by @xmath39 the @xmath40dimensional sphere , @xmath41 * [ i : thma3 ] @xmath26 has at most a polynomial growth : for some polynomial @xmath42 , we have @xmath43    then , there exists a unique symmetric density @xmath44 , such that almost surely , there exists @xmath45 such that @xmath46{*-weakly } \\rho_{\\infty}(x - c_{\\infty } ) \\ , \\mathrm{d}x.\\ ] ] moreover , there exists @xmath47 such that the speed of convergence of @xmath6 toward @xmath48 for the wasserstein distance is at least @xmath49{\\log t}\\}$ ] , where @xmath50 is the degree of @xmath42 .",
    "[ rk : spherical ] the assumption  [ i : thma1 ] ) corresponds to the physical assumption of the interaction force between two particles being directed along the line joining them , and to the third newton s law ( that is the equality between the action and the reaction forces ) .",
    "the symmetry assumption can not be omitted , as shows an example in the appendix .",
    "we will suppose in the following , without any loss of generality , that @xmath51 is of degree @xmath52 and such that for all @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , we choose @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a constant large enough .",
    "this will be used in   [ ss : measures ] .",
    "the origin of the following remark will be clear after the discussion in   [ s : free - energy ]    the density @xmath57 is the same limit density as in the result of @xcite , uniquely defined ( among the centered densities ) by the following property : @xmath57 is a positive function , proportional to  @xmath58 .    we can also consider the same drifted motion in presence of an external potential @xmath59 .",
    "for this , the following result is a generalization of theorem  [ t : main ] ( where we replace @xmath60 by @xmath61 in the notation ) :    [ t : main-2 ] let @xmath24 be the solution to the equation @xmath62 suppose , that @xmath63 and @xmath37 , and :    * spherical symmetric : @xmath38 ; * @xmath59 and @xmath26 are convex , @xmath64 , and either @xmath59 or @xmath26 is uniformly convex : @xmath65 * @xmath59 and @xmath26 have at most a polynomial growth : for some polynomial @xmath42 we have @xmath66 @xmath67    then , there exists a unique density @xmath44 , such that almost surely @xmath68{*-weakly } \\rho_{\\infty}(x ) \\ , \\mathrm{d}x.\\ ] ]    as the proof of the latter theorem coincides with the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] almost identically , we do not present it here . it suffices to add @xmath59 in the arguments below .",
    "moreover , if @xmath59 is symmetric with respect to some point @xmath69 , then the corresponding density @xmath70 is also symmetric with respect to the same point @xmath69 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ t : main ] is split into two parts .",
    "consider a natural `` reference point '' for a measure @xmath71 :    [ def : mu - c ] consider a measure @xmath71 on @xmath72 , decreasing fast enough for @xmath73 to be defined .",
    "the _ center _ of @xmath71 is the point @xmath74 such that @xmath75 , or equivalently , the point where the convolution @xmath73 ( the potential generated by @xmath71 ) takes its minimal value .",
    "also , we define the _ centered _ measure @xmath76 as the translation of the measure @xmath71 , bringing @xmath77 to the origin : @xmath78    this notion of center had been previously introduced by raimond in @xcite . indeed , to study the linear attracting @xmath79-dimensional case of brownian polymers , raimond has defined the center and proved that the process remains close to @xmath80 ( and that @xmath81 converges a.s . ) .",
    "+ a sufficient condition for the existence of the center is that @xmath26 is convex , and it is unique if @xmath26 is stricty convex .",
    "the first part of the proof of theorem  [ t : main ] consists in proving the convergence of centered occupation measures :    [ t : centered ] under the assumptions of theorem  [ t : main ] , for some symmetric density function @xmath44 , we have almost surely @xmath82{*-weakly } \\rho_{\\infty}(x ) \\ , \\mathrm{d}x\\ ] ]    the second is the convergence of centers :    [ t : centers ] under the assumptions of theorem  [ t : main ] , almost surely the centers @xmath83 converge to some ( random ) limit @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear that the two latter theorems imply the main result .",
    "let us sketch their proofs .",
    "first , a standard remark is markovianization : the behaviour of the pair @xmath85 is markovian",
    ". the reader will find it , together with some other standard remarks , in ",
    "[ ss : markov ] .",
    "unfortunately , the markov process @xmath85 is infinite - dimensional and , in general ( except for the case of a polynomial interaction @xmath26 ) , we do not manage to reduce to a finite - dimensional process .",
    "so , we do not use this information directly in order to obtain interesting properties on @xmath6 , because the state space is then too large .",
    "after this remark , we discuss the global existence and uniqueness for the solutions of   in  [ ss : global - exist ] .",
    "a next step is discretization : we take a ( well - chosen and deterministic ) sequence of times @xmath86 , with @xmath87 , and consider the behaviour of the measures  @xmath88 . as @xmath89 ,",
    "it is natural to expect ( and we will give the corresponding statement ) that the empirical measures @xmath6 on the interval @xmath90 $ ] almost do not change and thus stay close to @xmath88 .",
    "so , on this interval we can approximate the solution @xmath91 of   by the solution of the same equation with @xmath92 : @xmath93,\\ ] ] in other words , by a brownian motion in a potential  @xmath94 that does not depend on time .    on the other hand , the series of general term @xmath95 increases .",
    "so , using birkhoff ergodic theorem , we see that the ( normalized ) distribution @xmath96}$ ] of values of @xmath91 on these intervals becomes ( as @xmath97 increases ) close to the equilibrium measures @xmath98 for a brownian motion in the potential @xmath94 , where ( see  [ s : discretization ] ) @xmath99 but @xmath100},\\ ] ] so we have @xmath101 and @xmath102    this could motivate us to approximate the behaviour of the measures @xmath6 by trajectories of the flow ( on the infinite - dimensional space of measures ) @xmath103 or after a logarithmic change of variable @xmath104 , @xmath105    in fact , it is not _ a priori _ clear that the flow defined by   exists , as the space of measures is infinite - dimensional . though the flow can be shown to be well defined on a subspace of exponentially decreasing measures , we prefer to avoid all these problems by working directly with the discretization model in  [ s : discretization ] .",
    "nevertheless , this flow serves very well in motivating the considered functions and lemmas describing their behaviour , as the discretized procedure we have is in fact the euler method of finding solutions to  .      before proceeding further ,",
    "let us give a physical interpretation to the flow  , predicting its asymptotic behaviour .",
    "namely , note that a brownian motion drifted by some potential  @xmath59 , @xmath106 can be thought as movement of gas particles under this potential , and the stationary probability measure , @xmath107 , is the density with which the gas becomes distributed after some time passes .",
    "so , in dimension one , a discrete approximation to the flow   can be seen as follows .",
    "we take a tube , filled with @xmath26-interacting gas , separated in a plenty of very small cells ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .        each unit of time ,",
    "small parts ( of proportion @xmath108 ) of gas in these cells are separated , allowed to travel along the tube , and are proposed to equilibrate in the potential generated .",
    "this part of all the gas being small , its auto - interaction is negligible , thus their new distribution is governed by the field @xmath109 , generated by the major part of the particles staying fixed to their cells . the small part is then equilibrated to its weight @xmath108 times @xmath110 .",
    "then , it is separated again by the cells , thus the distribution after such step becomes @xmath111    on the other hand , this procedure does not require any work ( in the physical sense ) to be done : the only actions are opening and closing the doors .",
    "so , due to the general principle , one can expect that the system will tend to its equilibrium . and a tool allowing to show that it is the case is the _ free energy _ , that we recall in the next paragraph .",
    "we conclude by noticing that the same physical interpretation can be considered for the problem in any dimension @xmath79 , by placing in @xmath112 two close parallel walls ( corresponding to the tube in dimension one ) , and placing the cells along them .      a tool allowing to show the convergence of trajectories of   is the _ free energy _ that , due to a general physical principle , should not increase along the trajectories as long as we do not do any work .",
    "namely , consider an absolutely continuous probability measure @xmath113 ( by an abuse of notation , we denote the measure and its density by the same letter ) .",
    "imagine @xmath114 as the density of a gas , particles of which implement the brownian motion @xmath115 , as well as interact with the potential @xmath116 .",
    "then , one defines the _ free energy _ of @xmath71 as the sum of its `` entropy '' @xmath117 and `` potential energy '' : @xmath118 where the entropy of the measure @xmath71 is @xmath119 then , as we have already said , a general physical principle says that , as we are doing no work on the system , the free energy should decrease , and the system should tend to its minimum .    indeed , the free energy @xmath120 is a lyapunov function for the flow   ( when it is defined , though it is defined only for measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , and otherwise , @xmath121 ) .",
    "this can be seen by joining two statements : on one hand , the measure @xmath110 is ( what corresponds to the same physical principle ) the unique global minimum of a free energy @xmath122 of a non - interacting brownian motion in the exterior potential @xmath123 ( see  [ ss : physics ] and lemma  [ l : fixed - point ] in  [ s : free - energy ] ) .",
    "the second is the inequality @xmath124 where @xmath125 . on one hand ,",
    "it can be easily seen by an explicit computation , noticing that the entropy part is convex . on the other hand",
    ", such a differentiation corresponds to replacing some small parts of the gas distributed with respect to the measure @xmath71 by the one distributed with respect to the measure @xmath126 , and in the right - hand side we have the corresponding free energies of these small parts in the potential , generated by the main part of the gas .",
    "then , differentiating the function  @xmath120 along the trajectories of the flow  , one finds for the solution  @xmath127 @xmath128 with the equality if and only if @xmath129 .",
    "finally ( and we recall these arguments in  [ s : discretization ] ) , the fixed points of @xmath130 are exactly the translation images of the density @xmath70 , that is the centered global minimum of the functional @xmath120 .",
    "so , roughly speaking , the function @xmath120 is the lyapunov function of the flow  .",
    "the words `` roughly speaking '' here refer to that these arguments are non - rigorous : we avoided showing that the flow is indeed well - defined , the free energy functional is defined only for absolutely continuous measures , etc .",
    "though all of this serves well as a motivation to ( rigorous ) lemmas of free energy behaviour used in this paper .",
    "we conclude this paragraph by indicating that for the dynamics in presence of an exterior potential @xmath59 ( the case of theorem  [ t : main-2 ] ) one has to replace the free energy function by @xmath131 and , instead of @xmath132 , consider @xmath133 for the energy of `` small parts '' .",
    "we are now ready to conclude the sketches of the proofs of theorems  [ t : centered ] and  [ t : centers ] ( as it was already mentioned , they immediately imply theorem  [ t : main ] ) .",
    "namely , we consider the discretized euler - like evolution of the flow  , defined by the rule @xmath134 for the measures @xmath135 defined by this procedure , we obtain ( using discrete rigorous analogues of informal arguments of the previous paragraph ) some estimates on the speed with which their free energy decreases .",
    "this allows us to estimate distances from these measures to the set of translates of @xmath57 ( because they are the only minima of  @xmath120 ) .",
    "now , we are taking the true random trajectory  @xmath6 , and estimate the distance from the centered measures  @xmath136 to the equilibrium point . to do this at some moment @xmath20",
    ", we choose an earlier moment @xmath137 , replace the measure @xmath138 by a close smooth measure @xmath139 , and consider deterministic discrete iterates by  . on one hand , for this new trajectory the free energy is defined ( as we have chosen a smooth approximation ) , so we control the decrease of energy and hence the distance from the centered measure @xmath140 to @xmath57 . on the other hand ,",
    "an accurate computation allows us to control the distance between the random measure @xmath6 and the approximating deterministic image @xmath141 of its smooth perturbation .",
    "the sum of these distances then estimates the distance from @xmath136 to @xmath57 , and the obtained estimate tends to 0 as @xmath142 .",
    "this concludes the proof of theorem  [ t : centered ] .",
    "finally , to prove theorem  [ t : centers ] , one first computes the speed of drift of the center  @xmath81 , and then shows that the series of general term @xmath143 converges , and the oscillations @xmath144 } c_t$ ] tend to zero .",
    "this implies the existence of the limit of  @xmath81 as  @xmath142 .      at the beginning of section  [ s : preliminaries ]",
    ", we show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to   starting at any positive moment @xmath12 .",
    "the discussion of this topic at @xmath5 is postponed to the appendix . in the rest of section  [ s : preliminaries ]",
    ", we present some crucial preliminary computations which are at the basis of our proofs .",
    "most of the material there is not new , except for the combination of stochastic approximation of the empirical measure ( see @xcite ) with free energy functionals ( see @xcite ) and the achieving of a bound on the convergence rate .",
    "finally , section  [ s : proof ] is devoted to the proofs of our main results .",
    "the authors are very grateful to two anonymous referees for their useful comments which led to a rewritting of the paper for a better understanding .",
    "as usual , we denote by @xmath145 the space of signed ( bounded ) borel measures on @xmath72 and by @xmath146 its subspace of probability measures . we will need the following measure space : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the variation of @xmath71 ( that is @xmath149 with @xmath150 the hahn - jordan decomposition of @xmath71 : @xmath151 ) .",
    "belonging to this space will enable us to always check the integrability of @xmath42 ( and therefore of @xmath26 and its derivatives thanks to the domination condition  ) with respect to the ( random ) measures to be considered .",
    "we endow this space with the dual weighted supremum norm ( or dual @xmath42-norm ) defined for @xmath152 by @xmath153 we recall that @xmath154 , so that @xmath155 .",
    "this norm naturally arises in the approach to ergodic results for time - continuous markov processes of meyn & tweedie @xcite .",
    "it also makes @xmath156 a banach space .",
    "next , we consider @xmath157 .",
    "we remark that both @xmath156 and @xmath158 contain any probability measure with an exponential tail and , in particular , any compactly supported measure . for any @xmath159 , we also define @xmath160        first step in studying the trajectories of   is to pass to the couple @xmath85 .",
    "a standard remark is that the behaviour of this couple is infinite - dimensional markovian ( and in general , except for @xmath26 being polynomial , can not be reduced to a finite - dimensional markov process ) .",
    "this reduction is easily implied by the identity @xmath161 note that the second term in the right - hand side of   can be written as @xmath162}$ ] , where @xmath163}$ ] is the empirical measure during the time interval  @xmath164 $ ] : @xmath165}:=\\frac{1}{t_2-t_1 } \\int_{t_1}^{t_2 } \\delta_{x_u } \\ , \\mathrm{d}u.\\ ] ]    now , passing @xmath6 to the left - hand side of  , dividing by  @xmath166 and passing to the limit as @xmath167 , we obtain the following sde for the couple @xmath168 : @xmath169    for any @xmath170 , the local existence and uniqueness of solutions to  , in a neighbourhood of @xmath171 , is implied by well - known arguments : see theorem  11.2 of  @xcite .",
    "however , in order to study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to  , we should first show the global existence of these solutions , in other words , that they do not explode in a finite time .",
    "it will be done in   [ ss : c - estimates ] .",
    "note also that the equation   clearly has a singularity at  @xmath5 . to avoid this singularity ,",
    "sometimes the equation   is considered with an initial condition @xmath172 at some positive time @xmath12 ( and thus for @xmath173 ) . after the time - shift @xmath174",
    ", the system   transforms to @xmath175    in fact , we can restrict our consideration to such situations only ( as , anyway , we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions at infinity ) , but it is interesting to show that the equation   has indeed existence and uniqueness of solutions for any initial value problem  @xmath176 .",
    "it is done in the appendix .      a natural `` reference point '' that one can associate to a measure  @xmath71 is the equilibrium point @xmath74 of the potential it generates with  @xmath26 , defined by the equation @xmath177 ( see definition  [ def : mu - c ] ,  [ ss : main ] ) , that we refer to as the _ center _ of the measure  @xmath71 .",
    "also , it will be convenient to consider the _ centered measure _",
    "@xmath76 , obtained from  @xmath71 by the translation that shifts the center to the origin .",
    "note that the implicit function theorem allows to estimate ( on an interval of existence of solution @xmath85 to  ) the derivative @xmath178 of  @xmath179 .",
    "in particular , we will see that @xmath81 is a @xmath180-function on this interval .    indeed , the function @xmath181 is @xmath180-smooth : @xmath182 and for any @xmath183 we have @xmath184 .",
    "the implicit function theorem thus implies that @xmath81 is a @xmath180-function of @xmath20 ( on the interval of existence of solution ) , and that @xmath185      to continue our study , first we would like to obtain an estimate on the behaviour of the distance @xmath190 .",
    "namely , we are going to compare it with the ( absolute value of ) ornstein - uhlenbeck process , and to obtain exponential - decrease bounds on its occupation measure in  [ ss : exp - dec ] .",
    "[ p : ou - comparison ] the process @xmath191 can be considered as the first element of the pair @xmath192 of processes such that    1 .",

    "one obtains that the difference @xmath190 , while it is non - zero , satisfies the sde @xmath197 in the same way , the desired @xmath194 shall satisfy the equation @xmath198 where @xmath199 is also a brownian motion .",
    "so , take a one - dimensional standard brownian motion @xmath200 independent of the brownian motion @xmath201 and let @xmath199 be defined as @xmath202 where @xmath203 $ ] is a @xmath204-function which is identically zero in some neighbourhood of 0 and @xmath205 for any @xmath206 .",
