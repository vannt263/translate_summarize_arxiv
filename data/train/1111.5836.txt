    "neutrino oscillations have provided indisputable evidence for flavour violation in the neutral lepton sector . in the absence of any fundamental principle that prevents charged lepton flavour violation , one expects that extensions of the standard model ( sm ) accommodating neutrino masses and mixings should also allow for lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) in the charged lepton sector .",
    "indeed , the additional new flavour dynamics and new field content present in many extensions of the sm may provide contributions to charged lfv ( clfv ) processes such as radiative ( e.g. @xmath2 ) and three - body lepton decays ( for instance @xmath3 ) .",
    "these decays generally arise from higher order processes , and so their branching ratios ( brs ) are expected to be small , making them difficult to observe .",
    "thus , any clfv signal would provide clear evidence for new physics : mixings in the lepton sector and probably the presence of new particles , possibly shedding light on the origin of neutrino mass generation .",
    "the search for manifestations of charged lfv constitutes the goal of several experiments  @xcite , dedicated to look for signals of processes such as rare radiative decays , three - body decays and muon - electron conversion in nuclei . despite the fact that a clfv signal could provide clear evidence for new physics , the underlying mechanism of lepton mixing might be difficult to unravel . in parallel to the low - energy searches for new physics ,",
    "i.e. via indirect effects of possible new particles , the lhc has started to search directly for these new particles in its quest to unveil the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , thus possibly providing a solution to the sm hierarchy problem .    among the many possible extensions of the sm , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is a well motivated solution for the hierarchy problem , providing many other appealing aspects such as gauge coupling unification and dark matter candidates .",
    "if the lhc experiments indeed discover susy , it is then extremely interesting to consider supersymmetric models that can also explain neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "furthermore , it is only natural to expect that such models might also give rise to clfv .",
    "if susy is indeed realised in nature , clfv ( mediated by new sparticles ) would provide a new probe to explore the origin of lepton mixings , playing a complementary rle to other searches of new physics , i.e. lhc direct searches and neutrino dedicated experiments .",
    "one of the most economical possibilities is to embed a seesaw mechanism  @xcite in the framework of susy models ( i.e.  the susy seesaw ) @xcite . for any seesaw realisation",
    ", the neutrino yukawa couplings could leave their imprints in the susy soft - breaking slepton mass matrices , and consequently induce flavour violation at low energies due to the renormalisation group ( rg ) evolution of the susy soft - breaking parameters .",
    "the caveat of these scenarios is that , in order to have sufficiently large yukawa couplings ( as required to account for large clfv brs ) , the typical scale of the extra particles ( such as right handed neutrinos , scalar or fermionic isospin triplets ) is in general very high , potentially very close to the gauge coupling unification scale .",
    "however , such a high ( seesaw ) scale would be impossible to probe experimentally .",
    "on the other hand , the so - called inverse seesaw @xcite constitutes a very appealing alternative to the `` standard '' seesaw realisations .",
    "embedding an inverse seesaw mechanism in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) requires the inclusion of two additional gauge singlet superfields , with opposite lepton numbers ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "when compared to other susy seesaw realisations , clfv observables are enhanced in this framework , and such an enhancement can be attributed to large neutrino yukawa couplings ( @xmath6 ) , compatible with a seesaw scale @xmath7 , close to the electroweak one , thus within lhc reach .",
    "the differences between the inverse seesaw and the standard one can be conceptually understood from an effective point of view and linked to the distinct properties of the lepton number _ violating _ dimension-5 ( weinberg ) operator ( responsible for neutrino masses and mixings ) and the total lepton number _ conserving _",
    "dimension-6 operator , which is at the origin of clfv .",
    "contrary to what occurs in the standard seesaw , these two operators are de - correlated in the inverse seesaw , implying that the suppression of the coefficient of the dimension-5 operator will not affect the size of the coefficient of the dimension-6 operator . in both seesaws ,",
    "the latter operator is proportional to @xmath8 ; however , in the case of a type i seesaw , the dimension-5 operator is proportional to @xmath9 , while in the case of an inverse seesaw , it has a further suppression of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being a dimensionful parameter , linked to the mass of the sterile singlets ) .",
    "the dimension-6 operator will thus be extremely suppressed in the case of a type i seesaw , since in this case @xmath7 is very large to accommodate natural @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , in the inverse seesaw , small neutrino masses can easily be accommodated via tiny values of @xmath11 , which will not affect the dimension 6 operator .",
    "furthermore , such small values of @xmath11 are natural in the sense of t  hooft since in the limit where @xmath13 , the total lepton number symmetry is restored  @xcite .    in view of the strong potential of the inverse seesaw mechanism regarding clfv , several phenomenological studies have recently been carried out  @xcite . while a non - supersymmetric",
    "inverse seesaw requires two pairs of singlets to explain neutrino oscillation data  @xcite , the supersymmetric generalization can accommodate neutrino data  @xcite with just one pair of singlets .",
    "the latter scenario is also known as the minimal supersymmetric inverse seesaw model ( msism ) .",
    "this model can also comply with the dark matter relic abundance of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the extra tev scale singlet neutrinos may significantly contribute to clfv observables , irrespective of the supersymmetric states @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric realisations of the inverse seesaw may enhance these clfv rates even further ( e.g. the contributions to @xmath14 , which has been analysed in @xcite ) . furthermore , this seesaw model can have lhc signatures : the extra singlets can participate in the decay chains , leading to effects which can be important , particularly in the case in which one of the singlets is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on contributions to clfv observables , such as @xmath3 , arising from a higgs - mediated effective vertex .",
    "we explore the contributions which are due to the presence of comparatively light right - handed neutrinos and sneutrinos ( which are usually negligible in the framework of a type i susy - seesaw ) , while still having large neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "we find that all these contributions can lead to a significant enhancement of several clfv observables .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : mod ] , we define the model , providing a brief overview on the implementation of the inverse seesaw in the mssm . in section  [ lfv : diag ] , we discuss the implications of this model regarding low - energy clfv observables , particular emphasis being given to the higgs - mediated processes . in section  [ hmlfv ] , we study the higgs - mediated contributions to several lepton flavour violating observables and compare our results to present bounds and to future experimental sensitivities in section  [ sec : discussion ] . then we draw some generic conclusions on the viability of an inverse seesaw as the underlying mechanism of lfv .",
    "we finally conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the model consists of the mssm extended by three pairs of singlet superfields , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) ] with lepton numbers assigned to be @xmath5 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the supersymmetric inverse seesaw model is defined by the superpotential    & = & _ ab + m_r_i^c_i_i+ _ x_i_i_i  , [ eq : superpot ] where @xmath18 denote generation indices . in the above , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are the down- and up - type higgs superfields , @xmath21 denotes the su(2 ) doublet lepton superfields .",
    "@xmath22 represents the right - handed neutrino mass term which conserves lepton number .",
    "due to the presence of non - vanishing @xmath23 , the total lepton number @xmath24 is no longer a good quantum number ; nevertheless , notice that in our formulation @xmath25 is still a good symmetry . without loss of generality ,",
    "the terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 are taken to be diagonal in generation space . clearly , as @xmath28",
    ", lepton number conservation is restored , since @xmath29 does not violate lepton number .",
    "although in the present study we consider three generations of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we recall that in the minimal version of the susy inverse seesaw ( where only one generation of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is included ) , neutrino data can be accommodated  @xcite .    the soft susy breaking lagrangian can be written as -l_soft =- l^mssm_soft + m^2_^c ^c_i ^c_i + m^2_x x^_i x_i + ( a_y^ij__ab ^c_i l^a_j h_u^b + b_m_r_i ^c_i x_i + b__x_ix_i x_i + h.c . ) , [ eq : softsusy ] where @xmath32 denotes the soft susy breaking terms of the mssm . in the above , the singlet scalar states @xmath33 and @xmath34 are assumed to have flavour universal masses , i.e. @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the new terms involving the scalar partners of the sterile neutrino states ( notice that while the former conserves lepton number , the latter gives rise to a lepton number violating @xmath39 term ) .",
    "working under the assumption of a flavour - blind mechanism for susy breaking , we will assume universal boundary conditions for the soft susy breaking parameters at some very high energy scale ( e.g. the gauge coupling unification scale @xmath40 gev ) , m_= m_0 , m_= m_1/2 , a_i= a_0 .    before addressing neutrino mass generation ,",
    "a few comments on the nature of the superpotential are in order . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : superpot ] ) , the two singlets @xmath15 and @xmath41 are differently treated in the sense that a @xmath42 majorana mass term is present for @xmath41 ( @xmath43 ) , while no @xmath44 is present in @xmath45 .",
    "although a generic superpotential with @xmath25 should contain the latter term , let us notice that similar to what occurs for @xmath23 , the absence of @xmath46 also enhances the symmetry of the model ; moreover , we emphasise that it is the magnitude of @xmath23 ( and not that of @xmath46 ) which controls the size of the light neutrino mass  @xcite . in view of this , and for the sake of simplicity , we have assumed @xmath47 ( considering non - vanishing , yet small values of @xmath46 would not change the qualitative features of the model ) .",
    "although in our formulation we treat @xmath23 as an effective parameter , its origin can be explained either dynamically or in a framework of susy grand unified theories ( gut ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore @xmath48 can also be realised in extended frameworks  @xcite .    in order to illustrate the pattern of light neutrino masses in the inverse seesaw model and how it is related to the lepton number violating parameter @xmath23",
    ", we consider the one - generation case . in the @xmath49 basis",
    "the @xmath50 neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath51 with @xmath52 , yielding the mass eigenvalues ( @xmath53 ) : @xmath54 the above equation clearly reveals that the lightness of the smallest eigenvalue @xmath55 is indeed due to the smallness of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus the lepton number conserving mass parameters ( @xmath58 and @xmath29 ) are completely unconstrained in this model .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that the effective right - handed sneutrino mass term ( dirac - like ) is given by @xmath59 . assuming @xmath60(tev )",
    ", the effective mass term will not be very large , in clear contrast to what occurs in the standard ( type i ) susy seesaw . in our analysis",
    ", we will be particularly interested in the rle of such a light sneutrino ( i.e. @xmath61 ) in the enhancement of higgs mediated contributions to lepton flavour violating observables .",
    "in the susy seesaw framework , the only source of flavour violation is encoded in the neutrino yukawa couplings ( which are necessarily non - diagonal to account for neutrino oscillation data ) ; even under the assumption of universal soft breaking terms at the gut scale , radiative effects proportional to @xmath12 induce flavour violation in the slepton mass matrices , which in turn give rise to slepton mediated clfv observables  @xcite . as an example , in the leading logarithmic approximation , the rge corrections to the left - handed slepton soft - breaking masses are given by @xmath62 ( for simplicity , in the above we are implicitly assuming a degenerate right - handed neutrino spectrum , @xmath63 . )",
    "the rge - induced flavour violating entries , @xmath64 , give rise to the dominant contributions to low - energy flavour violating observables in the charged lepton sector , such as @xmath65 ( mediated by chargino - sneutrino and neutralino - slepton loops ) and @xmath66 ( from photon , @xmath67 and higgs mediated penguin diagrams ) .",
    "compared to the standard ( type i ) susy seesaw , where @xmath68 gev , the inverse seesaw is characterised by a right handed neutrino mass scale @xmath69 and this in turn leads to an enhancement of the factor @xmath70 , ( see eq .",
    "( [ slepmixing ] ) ) , and hence to all low - energy clfv observables , in the latter framework . furthermore , having right - handed sneutrinos whose mass is of the same order of the other sfermions , i.e. @xmath61 , the @xmath71-mediated processes are no longer suppressed , and might even significantly contribute to the low - energy flavour violating observables . here , we focus on the impact of such a light @xmath71 in the higgs mediated processes which are expected to be important in the large @xmath72 regime .",
    "although at tree level higgs - mediated neutral currents are flavour conserving , non - holomorphic yukawa interactions of the type @xmath73 can be induced at the one - loop level , as first noticed in  @xcite . in the large @xmath74 regime , in addition to providing significant corrections to the masses of the @xmath75-quark , these non - holomorphic couplings have an impact on @xmath76 mixing and flavour violating decays , in particular @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the lepton sector , the origin of the higgs - mediated flavour violating couplings can be traced to a non - holomorphic yukawa term of the form @xmath78",
    "other than the corrections to the @xmath79 lepton mass , these new couplings give rise to additional contributions to several clfv processes mediated by higgs exchange .",
    "in particular @xmath80 , @xmath81 ( the so - called double penguin processes ) were considered in  @xcite , while @xmath82 was studied in  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the several @xmath83 lepton flavour violating processes , namely @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) can be found in  @xcite .",
    "even though the flavour violating processes in the quark and lepton sectors have a similar diagrammatic origin , the source of flavour violation is different in each case . in the quark sector ,",
    "trilinear soft susy breaking couplings involving up - type squarks provide the dominant source of flavour violation  @xcite , while in the lepton case , lfv stems from the radiatively induced non - diagonal terms in the slepton masses ( see eq .",
    "( [ slepmixing ] ) )  @xcite .    in the standard susy seesaw ( type i ) ,",
    "the term @xmath86 is usually neglected , as it is suppressed by the very heavy right handed sneutrino masses ( @xmath87gev ) . however , in scenarios such as the inverse susy seesaw , where @xmath88(tev ) , this term may provide the dominant contributions to higgs mediated lepton flavour violation .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing the couplings of the neutral higgs fields to the charged leptons is given by -l^=|e^i_r y_e^ii e^j_l + .",
    "[ leff ] in the above , the first term corresponds to the usual yukawa interaction , while the coefficient @xmath89 encodes the corrections to the charged lepton yukawa couplings . in the basis where the charged lepton yukawa couplings are diagonal , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) , i.e. @xmath90 , is in general non - diagonal , thus providing a new source of charged lepton flavour violation through higgs mediation . its origin can be diagrammatically understood from fig.[1 ] , where flavour violation is parametrized via a mass insertion @xmath64 ( see eq .",
    "( [ slepmixing ] ) ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from table  [ 4 ] , one can verify that from an experimental point of view , the most promising channel in the supersymmetric inverse seesaw is @xmath82 which could be tested at the next generation of @xmath1 factories .",
    "the @xmath91 decay might also be interesting , but little conclusions can be drawn due to lack of information concerning the future sensitivities .",
    "it is important to stress that the numerical results summarised in table  [ 4 ] correspond to considering _ only _ higgs - mediated contributions . in the low @xmath72 regime ,",
    "photon- and @xmath67-penguin diagrams may induce comparable or even larger contributions to the observables , and potentially enhance the branching fractions .",
    "thus , the results for small @xmath72 should be interpreted as conservative estimates , representing only partial contributions . for large @xmath74 values , higgs penguins",
    "do indeed provide the leading contributions .",
    "comparing our results with those obtained for a type i susy seesaw at high scales ( or even with a tev scale susy seesaw ) , we find a large enhancement of the branching fractions in the inverse seesaw framework .",
    "another interesting property of the higgs - mediated processes is that the corresponding amplitude strongly depends on the chirality of the heaviest lepton ( be it the decaying lepton , or the heaviest lepton produced in @xmath1 decays ) .",
    "considering the decays of a left - handed lepton @xmath92 , one finds that the corresponding branching ratios would be suppressed by a factor @xmath93 compared to those of the right - handed lepton @xmath94 .",
    "this can induce an asymmetry that potentially allows to identify if higgs mediation is the dominant contribution to the lfv observables .",
    "furthermore this asymmetry would be more pronounced in the inverse - seesaw framework .    due to its strong enhancement of the higgs - penguin contributions , if realised in nature , the inverse seesaw offers a unique framework to test higgs effects in lfv processes .",
    "in fact , and as discussed in   @xcite , if photon penguins provide the dominant contribution to both @xmath95 and @xmath96 , then the latter observables are strongly correlated , @xmath97 ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dominant contribution to the three - body decays arises from higgs penguins , the correlation no longer holds , and the latter ratio can be significantly enhanced .",
    "this would be the case of the present framework .",
    "if observed , charged lepton flavour violation clearly signals the presence of new physics . in this work ,",
    "we have studied higgs - mediated lfv processes in the framework of the supersymmetric inverse seesaw .",
    "tev scale right - handed neutrinos ( and hence light right - handed sneutrinos ) offer the possibility to enhance the higgs - mediated contributions to several lfv processes .",
    "as shown in this work , in the inverse susy seesaw , lfv branching ratios can be enhanced by as much as two orders of magnitude when compared to the standard ( type i ) susy seesaw .",
