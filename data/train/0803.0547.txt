    "with 5 years of observations of jupiter and an extensive physical optics modeling of beams @xcite , our understanding of the beam transfer function , @xmath102 , has improved significantly : the fractional beam errors , @xmath103 , have been nearly halved in most differencing assemblies ( das ) . in some cases , e.g. ,",

    "many of the small - scale cmb experiments have been calibrated to the _ wmap _  3-year data at high multipoles .",

    "for example , the latest acbar data @xcite report on the calibration error of 2.23% in temperature ( 4.5% in power ) , which is twice as large as the magnitude of mis - calibration ; thus , we expect the effect of mis - calibration to be sub - dominant in the error budget .",
    "note that the change in the beam is fully consistent with the 1-@xmath107 error of the previous _ wmap _   beam reported in @xcite .",
    "since the acbar calibration error includes the previous _ wmap _  beam error , the change in the beam should have a minimal impact on the current acbar calibration .    while we use only v and w bands for the cosmological analysis of the temperature data ,",

    "the 5-year estimate of the point source correction , @xmath111 @xcite , is slightly lower than the 3-year estimate , @xmath112 @xcite , partly because more sources have been detected and masked by the 5-year source mask ( 390 sources have been detected in the 5-year temperature data , whereas 323 sources were detected in the 3-year data @xcite ) .",

    "the uncertainty in the previous estimate was inflated to include the lower value found by @xcite ( 0.011 ) and higher value from our original estimate ( 0.017 ) .",
    "much of the discrepancy between these estimates is due to the multipole range over which @xmath108 is fit . with the improved beam model from the 5-year analysis , the dependence on the multipole range has disappeared , and thus we no longer need to inflate our uncertainty .",

    "_ low-@xmath121 temperature _  we use the gibbs sampling technique and the blackwell - rao ( br ) estimator to evaluate the likelihood of the temperature power spectrum at @xmath122 @xcite . for the 3-year analysis we used the resolution 4 internal linear combination ( ilc ) temperature map ( @xmath123 ) with a gaussian smoothing of @xmath124 ( fwhm ) .",

    "we believe that we understand the polarized foreground emission ( dominated by synchrotron , traced well by the k - band data ) in the ka band data well enough to justify the inclusion of the ka band @xcite .",
    "this , with 2 years more integration , has led to a significant reduction of the noise power spectra ( averaged over @xmath130 ) in the polarization ee and bb power spectra by a factor of as much as 2.3 compared to the 3-year analysis . as a result ,",
    "the ee power spectrum averaged over @xmath130 exceeds the noise by a factor of 10 , i.e. , our measurement of the ee power spectrum averaged over @xmath130 is now limited by cosmic variance and the possibility of residual foreground emission and/or systematic errors , rather than by noise .",

    "we find that the w band polarization data still contain the systematic errors that we do not understand fully , and thus we do not use the w band polarization for the cosmological analysis .",
    "we do not find any evidence for the unaccounted instrumental systematic errors in the other bands that we use for cosmology .",
    "the most dominant systematic errors in the cosmological analysis are the foreground emission . since cmb dominates over the foreground emission in the temperature data in v and w bands outside the galaxy mask , and we also reduce the sub - dominant foreground contamination at high galactic latitudes further by using the k- and ka - band data ( for synchrotron emission ) , the external h@xmath131 map ( for free - free emission ) , and the external dust map , the systematic errors from the foreground emission are unimportant for the temperature data , even at the lowest multipoles where the foreground is most important @xcite .",
    "we , however , find that the uncertainty in our modeling of the _ polarized _ foreground is not negligible compared to the statistical errors . for the 5-year polarization analysis we have used two independent foreground - cleaning algorithms : one based upon the template fitting ( as developed for the 3-year analysis ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the other based upon the gibbs sampling @xcite .",

    "inflation models with featureless scalar - field potentials usually predict that @xmath236 is _ nearly _ a power - law @xcite @xmath237 here , @xmath238 is a useful quantity , which gives an approximate contribution of @xmath239 at a given scale per logarithmic interval in @xmath240 to the total variance of @xmath239 , as @xmath241 .",

    "they are motivated physically by the fact that most inflation models satisfy the slow - roll conditions , and thus deviations from a pure power - law , scale - invariant spectrum , @xmath242 and @xmath243 , are expected to be small , and the higher - order derivative terms such as @xmath253 and higher are negligible . on the other hand , there is always a danger of missing some important effects , such as sharp features , when one relies too much on a simple parametrization like this .",

    "all of these effects go in the same direction , i.e. , to increase the power at high multipoles and reduce a negative running index .",
    "we find that these factors contribute to the upward shift in @xmath202 at comparable levels .",

    "this means that no vorticity would arise , and therefore no b mode polarization can be generated from density or velocity perturbations in the linear regime .",

    "there are two situations in which the adiabatic condition may be satisfied : ( 1 ) there is only one degree of freedom in the system , e.g. , both radiation and matter were created from decay products of a single scalar field that was solely responsible for generating fluctuations , and ( 2 ) matter and radiation were in thermal equilibrium before any non - zero conserving quantum number ( such as baryon number minus lepton number , @xmath634 ) was created ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , detection of any non - adiabatic fluctuations , i.e. , any deviation from the adiabatic condition ( eq .  [ [ eq : adi ] ] ) , would imply that there were multiple scalar fields during inflation , _ and _ either matter ( baryon or dark matter ) was never in thermal equilibrium with radiation , or a non - zero conserving quantum number associated with matter was created well before the era of thermal equilibrium . in any case , the detection of non - adiabatic fluctuations between matter and radiation has a profound implication for the physics of inflation and , perhaps more importantly , the origin of matter .",
    "for example , axions , a good candidate for dark matter , generate non - adiabatic fluctuations between dark matter and photons , as axion density fluctuations could be produced during inflation independent of curvature perturbations ( which were generated from inflaton fields , and responsible for cmb anisotropies that we observe today ) , _ and _ were not in thermal equilibrium with radiation in the early universe ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for reviews ) .",

    "for neutrinos and photons we consider only adiabatic perturbations .",
    "in other words , we consider only three standard neutrino species ( i.e. , no sterile neutrinos ) , and assume that the neutrinos were in thermal equilibrium before the lepton number was generated .    the basic idea behind this study is not new , and",
