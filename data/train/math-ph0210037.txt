    "wilson loops play a very important role in gauge theories .",

    "the generalization of abelian gauge symmetries is in this case given by transformations of the form @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",

    "a nonabelian generalization seems to require necessarily that along with @xmath1 one has an ordinary connection @xmath20 on some principal bundle @xmath21 .",
    "the field @xmath1 is then assumed to be a tensorial @xmath2-form on @xmath22 .    if the map @xmath23 describes an @xmath24-family of imbedded loops ( viz .",

    "if such an observable is then considered in the context of nonabelian @xmath0 theories ( which implies that one has to take @xmath30 ) , one gets cohomology classes of the vassiliev type on the space of imbeddings of a circle into @xmath4 @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are however interested in the case where @xmath10 is an imbedding of @xmath9 into @xmath4 .",

    ". more general invariants may be obtained at higher orders .",
    "( these results have appeared in @xcite to which we will recurringly refer for more technical details . )",
    "we believe that our wilson surfaces may have broader applications in gauge theories .      in section  [ sec - canbf ] , we recall nonabelian canonical @xmath0 theories and give a very formal , but intuitively clear , definition of wilson surfaces , see and .",
    "we discuss their formal properties and , in particular , we clarify why we expect their expectation values to yield invariants of higher - dimensional knots .",
    "( in this section by invariant we mean a @xmath34-invariant function on the space of imbeddings @xmath35 . )    in section  [ sec - bvw ] , we give a more precise and at the same time more general definition of wilson surfaces under the simplifying assumption that we work on _ trivial _ principal bundles .",
    "the properties of wilson surfaces are here summarized in terms of descent equations , the crucial point of the whole discussion being the modified quantum master equation  .",

    "the `` quantum '' descent equation , on the other hand , still relies on some formal arguments .    in section  [ sec - pertlong ]",
    ", we discuss the perturbative expansion of the expectation value of a wilson surface in @xmath0 theory .",
    "the main results we obtain by considering the first three orders in perturbation theory are a generalization of the self - linking number , the bott invariant , and a new invariant for long @xmath38-knots , see prop .",

    "we will denote by @xmath41 and @xmath42 the affine space of connection @xmath43-forms and the group of gauge transformations , respectively .",

    "given @xmath51 and @xmath52 , one defines the canonical @xmath0 action functional by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the curvature @xmath38-form of @xmath20 and @xmath55 denotes the extension to forms of the adjoint and coadjoint type of the canonical pairing between @xmath40 and @xmath56 .",
    "the critical points of @xmath57 are pairs @xmath58 where @xmath20 is flat and @xmath1 is covariantly closed , i.e. , solutions to @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath0 action functional is invariant under the action of an extension of the group @xmath42 of gauge transformations , viz . , the semidirect product @xmath60 , where @xmath42 acts on the abelian group @xmath61 via the coadjoint action .",
    "a pair @xmath62 acts on a pair @xmath58 by    [ sym ] @xmath63    and it is not difficult to prove that @xmath64 .    by definition",

    "we are now going to define an observable for @xmath0 theories associated to an imbedding @xmath69 , where @xmath9 is a fixed @xmath70-dimensional manifold .",
    "the first observation is that , using @xmath10 , one can pull back the principal bundle @xmath22 to @xmath9 ; let us denote by @xmath71 the principal bundle over @xmath9 obtained this way . given a connection one - form @xmath20 on @xmath22 , we denote by @xmath72 the induced connection one - form on @xmath71 ; moreover , given @xmath52 we denote by @xmath73 the induced element of @xmath74 .",
    "we then define @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "our observable , which we will call wilson surface , is then defined as the following functional integral : @xmath78 there are two important observations at this point :    1 .   at first sight",
    "we have a gaussian integral where the quadratic part pairs @xmath79 with @xmath80 but there is no linear term in @xmath80 ; so it seems that one could omit the linear term in @xmath79 as well . as a consequence",
    "@xmath81 would not depend on @xmath1 and would then have a rather trivial expectation value in @xmath0 theory .",
    "the point however is that has in general zero modes .",
    "one has then to expand around each zero mode and then integrate over them ( with some measure `` hidden '' in the notation @xmath82 ) .",
    "this makes things more interesting as we will see in the rest of the paper ; in particular , the dependency of @xmath81 on @xmath1 will be nontrivial .",
    "2 .   the action functional may have symmetries ( depending on @xmath20 and @xmath1 ) which make the quadratic part around critical points degenerate .",
    "so in the computation of @xmath81 the choice of some adapted gauge fixing is understood .",
    "we defer a more precise discussion to the following sections .",

    "the mixed expectation value of @xmath338 and @xmath444 is more interesting .",
    "if @xmath442 does not intersect @xmath10 , the product defines an observable , and one can show that @xmath445 where @xmath446 is the induced representation of @xmath40 and @xmath447 is the linking number between ( the images of ) @xmath10 and @xmath442 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath448 where @xmath449{ccc } { { { \\mathbb{r}}}^{m-2}\\times s^1 } & \\to & { c_2({{\\mathbb{r}}}^m)}\\\\ { ( x , t ) } & \\mapsto & { ( f(x),\\gamma(t ) ) }    \\end{array}}\\ ] ]    the result in is tantamount saying that the only connected diagram arising from the @xmath2th order in @xmath444 expanded in powers of @xmath450 is the one obtained by joining each of these @xmath2 @xmath450s to a short snake @xmath451 .",
    "this result is purely combinatorial after observing that either joining the last @xmath243 of a snake to the @xmath167 of a @xmath451 or joining the two @xmath243s of an interaction vertex to the @xmath167s of two @xmath451s yields a factor @xmath452}}$ ] which clearly vanishes .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new observable for @xmath0 theories that is associated to imbeddings of codimension two .",
    "we list here some possible follow - ups of our work .      in @xcite , yang ",
    "mills theory is regarded as a deformation , called @xmath0ym theory , of @xmath0 theory with deformation parameter the coupling constant @xmath453 . in this setting",
    "@xmath454 becomes an observable for the @xmath0ym theory in the topological limit @xmath455 .",
    "moreover , in this limit the expectation value of this observable times a wilson loop is still given by .",
    "thus , @xmath81 might constitute the topological limit of a dual t  hooft variable @xcite .",
    "assume @xmath1 to be a two form ( in the context of @xmath0 theories , we assume then that we are working in four dimensions ) . in the abelian case ,",
    "the observable defines a connection for the gerbe defined by @xmath1 @xcite ; in this case , it is interesting to consider also the case when @xmath9 has boundary . a suitable extension of our observable @xmath81 to this case",
    "would then be a candidate for a connection on a nonabelian gerbe .      for @xmath4 of the form @xmath456 ,",
    "the reduced phase space of @xmath0 theory is the space of pairs @xmath457 , with @xmath20 a flat connection on @xmath458 and @xmath1 a covariantly closed @xmath70-form of the coadjoint type , modulo symmetries .",
    "the poisson algebra generated by generalized wilson loops is considered in @xcite and , in the case @xmath459 it is proved to be related to the chas ",
    "sullivan string topology @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see which new structure one may obtain by considering the poisson algebra generated by generalized wilson loops and , in addition , our new observables .      in section  [ sec - pertlong ]",
    "we have described how the perturbative expansion produces ( potential ) invariants of long knots .",
    "the same formulae may be used to define forms on the space of imbeddings @xmath460 of @xmath461 into @xmath350 ( with fixed linear behavior @xmath130 at infinity ) with @xmath462 ; up to hidden faces , these forms are closed ( they certainly are so for @xmath3 odd ) . this way , we produce cohomology classes on @xmath460 .",
    "generalizing @xcite , one can define a graph cohomology for graphs with two types of vertices ( corresponding to points on the imbedding and in the ambient space ) and two types of edges ( corresponding to the two types of propagators ) such that the `` integration map '' that associates to a graph the corresponding integral over configuration spaces is a chain map up to hidden faces .",
    "the feynman diagrams discussed in this paper produce then nontrivial classes in this graph cohomology .",
