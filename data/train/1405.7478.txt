    "recent discovery of a mysterious , diffuse gamma - ray emission from the central portion of the milky way @xcite which are seen as giant features ( fermi bubbles ) elongated perpendicular to the galactic plane , was one of the marvelous discoveries in high energy astrophysics .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum from the bubbles is harder than elsewhere in the galaxy , @xmath0 .",
    "this gamma - ray excess in the bubble region correlates with the earlier discovered so - called microwave haze observed by the wmap telescope as described by @xcite and @xcite , and with the large scale x - ray emission region first evidenced by analysing the _ rosat _ 1.5 kev data , which clearly showed the characteristic of a bipolar flow ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it was suggested that the _ rosat _ structure resulted from a fast wind that drove a shock into the halo gas with velocity @xmath1cm / s .",
    "this phenomenon requires an energy release @xmath2erg at the galactic center ( gc ) , which should be periodic in a time scale of @xmath3yrs @xcite .",
    "the wmap haze was uncovered within the latitude range about 30@xmath4 and was roughly bounded by the bipolar structure of x - rays .",
    "the existence of such haze implies a population of anomalously hard spectrum electrons toward the gc @xcite .",
    "recently , the planck collaboration @xcite detected a residual diffuse emission in the range above 30 ghz region surroundings of the gc whose spatial distribution correlated nicely with the fermi bubbles . at galactic latitudes",
    "@xmath5 , the microwave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma - ray bubbles ( fbs ) .",
    "the correlation between these two features implies that the bubbles are real and their multi - wavelength emissions have a common origin .",
    "the derived spectrum is consistent with the power - law favoring synchrotron radiation from electrons with a spectrum @xmath6 .",
    "this implies also a new mechanism for cosmic - ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy .",
    "further analysis of radio emission from the bubble region provided by @xcite at 2.3 ghz detected two giant , linearly - polarized radio lobes , emanating from the gc .",
    "the lobes extend  @xmath7 , bear a close correspondence to the fermi bubbles .",
    "they concluded that the lobes are permeated by strong magnetic field strength up to 15 @xmath8 g .",
    "it is necessary to mention that the giant structures emanating from the centre of our galaxy are not unique .",
    "even more giant structures are clearly seen in the direction of cen - a in ghz radio @xcite , gev @xcite and tev @xcite gamma - ray ranges .",
    "recently @xcite found x - ray features in the lobe of cen - a which they interpreted as emission of relativistic electrons in - situ accelerated in the cen - a lobes up to energies @xmath9 tev .",
    "giant x - ray and radio lobes ( bubbles ) were found also in the galaxies ngc 3801 @xcite , mrk 6 @xcite and circinus galaxy @xcite .",
    "the origin of the bubbles is actively discussed in the literature .",
    "these models include some phenomenological assumptions about processes of energy release and particle production in the bubbles .",
    "thus the assumed energy release in the gc needed for the bubble formation ranges from @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 supplied by star formation regions as assumed by @xcite to a hypothetical scenario of a single accretion with the released energy about @xmath12 erg ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when a massive molecular clouds or a star cluster was captured by the central black hole ten million years ago",
    ".    different mechanisms of gamma - ray production in the bubbles are suggested to explain the observed flux from the bubbles .",
    "thus , @xcite and @xcite suggested the hadronic origin of gamma - ray emission from the bubbles , when gamma - ray photons are produced by collisions of relativistic protons with that of the background gas .",
    "alternatively , these gamma - rays can be produced by the inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons on background photons ( leptonic model ) and the same electrons generate radio and microwave emission from the bubbles via synchrotron ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". there may be several sources ( processes ) which generate relativistic electrons in the bubbles :    * in - situ stochastic acceleration by mhd - turbulence nearby the bubble surface @xcite .",
    "* acceleration by shocks originated from repeated tidal disruption of stars captured by the smbh at the gc @xcite .",
    "* acceleration within jets near the gc about @xmath13 yr ago , and subsequent electron transfer into the bubble by convective flows @xcite .",
    "the goal of theoretical models is to explain a number of emission parameters which have several remarkable features in the bubbles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    1 .   the structures are symmetrically elongated in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "spectra of radio emission from the bubbles are harder than anywhere in the galaxy , and the assumed spectrum of electrons is a power - law , @xmath14 .",
    "3 .   the spatial distribution of emission in the bubbles shows sharp edges of the bubbles .",
    "the surface emissivity is almost uniform inside the bubbles although findings of @xcite might indicate that some features of the gamma - ray spectrum at latitudes @xmath15 could be interpreted as a contribution from the dark matter annihilation nearby the gc .",
    "almost all fb models on the spectra of nonthermal emission depend on free parameters that allows more or less easily to reproduce the data derived from observations .",
    "we deem that these parameters can be restricted quantitatively , if we estimate how many high energy particles can be generated by this or that mechanism of acceleration .",
    "the number of high energy particles has not been estimated previously , although this parameter gives a strong restriction on acceleration processes as we intend to show from our investigations .",
    "below we analyse leptonic models of gamma - rays from the fb in which gamma - rays are generated by inverse compton . here",
    "we do not suggest a new model of acceleration but instead our goal is to understand whether the existing models are able to provide enough emitting particles .",
    "we analyse this aspect of stochastic acceleration and shock acceleration models in this and subsequent papers .",
    "the stochastic acceleration can be provided by interaction of charged particles with a hydromagnetic turbulence which is excited in the halo by jets ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or by a shock ( as assumed by * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively this acceleration is provided by interaction of particles with a supersonic turbulence ( shocks ) which arises from tidal disruptions of stars captured by the smbh at the gc as proposed by @xcite . to provide seeds for stochastic acceleration in the bubbles ,",
    "there are no other evident sources of electrons except those from the background plasma or those injected from the galactic plane by sources such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) , pulsars , jets , etc . , or from @xmath16 collisions in the halo ( secondary electrons ) .",
    "we aim to define model restrictions for different processes of particle acceleration in the bubbles .",
    "in particular the goal of our analysis is to define whether the processes of stochastic or mulitple shock acceleration are able to accelerate electrons up to high energies and at what conditions they provide relativistic electrons in the bubble with the required density and spectrum .",
    "we start from the case of stochastic acceleration from a background plasma which has it own specificity . particularly , in order to estimate the number of accelerated electrons we should estimate a flux of thermal electrons running - away away into the region of acceleration which is generated by coulomb collisions of thermal particles ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we included into the kinetic equation two additional terms describing the coulomb scattering .",
    "the kinetic equations with terms describing particle injection from a thermal plasma have not been investigated in previous models of the fbs .",
    "the kinetic equation for the distribution function of electrons , @xmath17 , in the case of in - situ acceleration has the form @xmath18}+\\frac{f}{\\tau}=0\\ , ,   \\label{eq_nr}\\ ] ] where the dimensionless momentum @xmath19 is in units of @xmath20 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath21 includes the thermal and nonthermal components of the particle distribution .",
    "coefficient @xmath22 describes particle ionization / coulomb energy losses and @xmath23 describes diffusion in the momentum space due to coulomb collisions ( for equations for these term see * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is the lifetime of particles in the region of acceleration e.g. due to escape from there .",
    "the stochastic ( fermi ) acceleration is described as diffusion in the momentum space with the coefficient @xmath25 , whose value is determined by the frequency of particle collisions with , e.g. magneto - hydrodynamic fluctuations or shocks . in the case of scattering by resonant mhd - waves the coefficient has the form ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 is a strength of large scale magnetic field , and @xmath29 is the power spectrum of mhd - waves propagating along a magnetic field line in the both directions . here @xmath8 is the cosine of particle pitch - angle and @xmath30 where @xmath19 is in @xmath20 units .    in the case of stochastic acceleration of electrons by a supersonic turbulence",
    "the coefficient of momentum diffusion is ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the shock velocity , and @xmath33 is the average separation between two shocks .",
    "the acceleration by a supersonic turbulence is possible if the mean path length of electrons determined by energy losses and spatial diffusion in the intershock medium is larger than the separation between shocks .",
    "the acceleration is effective when the rate of acceleration exceeds that of losses , i.e. for @xmath34 @xmath35    a naive assumption could be that in the range @xmath36 the spectrum is maxwellian , and for @xmath34 the spectrum is non - thermal ( power - law ) .",
    "however , calculations of the non - thermal component is non - trivial .",
    "as @xcite showed , the acceleration distorted the equilibrium maxwellian spectrum of background particles because of the flux of particles running - away into the acceleration region . even in the case",
    "when only a small part of thermal particles are accelerated and the coefficient of the kinetic equation ( @xmath22 and @xmath37 ) are determined by the maxwellian part of the spectrum , that makes eq .",
    "( [ eq_nr ] ) linear , a very broad transfer region between the thermal and non - thermal parts of the spectrum is generated by the acceleration .",
    "the calculation showed that the number of accelerated particles was larger than it followed from trivial estimates .",
    "this linear approximation was used by @xciteand @xcite who interpreted nonthermal x - ray emission of galaxy clusters by in - situ accelerated electrons .",
    "however , approximation of @xcite does not take into account a backward reaction of accelerated particles on the thermal component .",
    "this effect can be analysed if the coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ eq_nr ] ) , i.e. @xmath22 and @xmath37 , are calculated for the total distribution function which includes both thermal and non - thermal components ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "analysis of the nonlinear version of eq .",
    "( [ eq_nr ] ) was provided by @xcite and @xcite who showed that the energy supplied by sources of stochastic acceleration was quickly absorbed by the thermal plasma because of the ionization / coulomb energy losses of accelerated particles . as a result",
    "this acceleration is accompanied mainly by plasma overheating while a tail of nonthermal particles is not formed , i.e. the effect of stochastic acceleration is negligible .",
    "this conclusion was later revised by @xcite who derived from analytical and numerical calculations that the efficiency of stochastic acceleration depended strongly on parameters of acceleration .",
    "for some conditions the conclusion of @xcite and @xcite holds , i.e. , plasma overheating does occur . however , there are conditions under which the acceleration forms a prominent non - thermal tail while the background plasma is not overheated .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented the coefficient @xmath25 in an arbitrary form as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are arbitrary parameters , i.e. the acceleration is effective in the momentum range @xmath42 .",
    "we notice , however , that there are physical reasons for a cut - off at @xmath41 , e.g. it may occur in the mhd - spectrum of turbulence due to processes of wave absorption by accelerated cosmic rays ( crs ) . in appendix [ appen ] we presented a qualitative estimations for @xmath41 .",
    "we showed there that for an appropriate combination of parameters the value of @xmath41 is about 0.2 .",
