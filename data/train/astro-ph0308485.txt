    "black - hole x - ray binaries ( bh xrbs ) have been reliably identified as soft x - ray transients with dynamical mass measurements of the accreting compact objects  @xcite .",
    "more than a dozen are known at present  @xcite , the majority of them with low - mass donors  @xcite .",
    "their transient behavior is currently understood in the context of a viscous disk instability including the effects of disk irradiation  @xcite .",
    "it has been noted for some time now that no bh xrb has ever been observed in a galactic globular cluster ( gc ) , even though large numbers of neutron - star ( ns ) xrbs exist in gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed dynamical interactions in a dense star cluster can greatly enhance formation rates for close binaries with compact objects .",
    "this is well understood theoretically  @xcite and well established observationally  @xcite .",
    "if bh xrb formation were similarly enhanced in gcs , some bh x - ray transients should have been detected in outburst by now .",
    "instead , all soft x - ray transients and bright , persistent x - ray sources discovered in gcs have been shown to harbor ns with the detection of type i bursts  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the absence of bh xrb from gcs has been interpreted as evidence that bhs evolve differently in clusters @xcite .",
    "primordial bhs in gcs are throught to go through the spitzer mass - segregation instability  @xcite , concentrating in a dense core and effectively decoupling from the rest of the cluster . through dynamical interactions they form binaries with two possible outcomes : ( i ) either the central bh cluster completely evaporates ( ejecting bhs through strong interactions ) leaving behind at most @xmath0 bh ( single or binary ) , or ( ii ) successive mergers of binary bhs in the cluster driven by gravitational radiation form a @xmath2m@xmath3 intermediate - mass bh  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "one might expect this imbh to become visible as an ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) , if it is not ejected from the cluster by gravitational radiation recoil during the merger process  @xcite . while no such source has been observed in the old galactic gcs , ulxs",
    "have been observed in younger extragalactic star clusters  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the consequences of a single @xmath4m@xmath3 bh remaining in the dense gc core .",
    "we will show that the absence of any detected bh x - ray transient in a galactic gc does not necessarily rule out the presence of @xmath0 bh in every cluster .",
    "black holes are formed from stars with initial masses @xmath5 , which end their lives in @xmath6myr . on this timescale",
    "it is unlikely that relaxation processes will have affected the cluster structure significantly ( cf .  grkan et al .",
    "we make the standard assumption that kicks from asymmetric explosions scale with mass ( compared to nss ) and therefore are too low ( @xmath7 ) to eject many bhs from the cluster  ( in contrast to nss , where one faces a serious  retention problem  ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after the evolution of massive stars down to @xmath8 , bhs become the most massive objects in the cluster and their subsequent dynamical evolution is driven by two - body relaxation and mass segregation .    since bhs",
    "are expected to be distributed throughout the cluster initially , their mass segregation timescale is proportional to the initial half - mass relaxation time of the whole cluster , @xmath9 , and inversely proportional to the bh mass @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the average stellar mass in the cluster  @xcite .",
    "typical values for galactic gcs are @xmath13yr and @xmath14m@xmath3 , so that a population of @xmath4m@xmath15 bhs is expected to decouple dynamically in @xmath16yr .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the bh sub - cluster is dominated by bh  bh interactions on their _ own _ relaxation time , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the 3d velocity dispersion of bhs and @xmath19 is the mass density of the bh sub - cluster  ( see eq .",
    "8 - 71 in binney & tremaine 1987 ; hereafter bt ) . here",
    "@xmath20 is set by the depth of the gc potential , but @xmath19 is rather uncertain . since decoupling occurs when the bh density becomes comparable to the density of the background stars , we adopt a value comparable to the central density of typical pre - collapse gcs today  @xcite .",
    "bhs are ejected initially out to the gc halo ( from where they sink back to the core on a short timescale @xmath21 due to dynamical friction ) , but , as the bh sub - cluster collapse proceeds and binaries harden on @xmath22 , very soon they are ejected out of the gc altogether .",
    "we can estimate an upper limit to the timescale for complete evaporation by using the classical result for exponential evaporation in systems of equal point masses : @xmath23  ( see eq .  8 - 79 in bt ) . therefore the time for all bhs to evaporate and only @xmath0 to remain in the cluster is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the initial number of bhs in the gc .",
    "in reality , evaporation is a more complex process driven mainly by inelastic collisions of binary bhs , possibly affected by gravitational radiation , and the time for complete evaporation is likely to be substantially smaller than the above classical estimate  @xcite . here",
    ", we conservatively adopt @xmath26yr .",
    "since this timescale is comparable to the typical relaxation time @xmath9 of the whole cluster , we expect that , at the end of the evaporation process , the density of normal stars in the cluster will have started increasing through gravothermal contraction , and the remaining @xmath0 bh at the center of the cluster will be interacting significantly with normal stars .",
    "there are two interaction processes through which a bh can acquire a normal stellar companion : exchange interactions of the bh with primordial binaries  @xcite and tidal captures ( tc ) of main - sequence ( ms ) stars by the bh  @xcite .",
    "the delay between the creation of an xrb progenitor and the birth of the xrb ( when mass transfer is initiated through roche - lobe overflow ) can be neglected if the bh companion is already somewhat evolved , i.e. , its mass is comparable to the ms turn - off ( to ) mass .",
    "this is likely to be the case for several reasons : ( i ) the gc center is dominated by the most massive stars because of mass segregation ; ( ii ) exchange interactions have a much higher probability of ejecting the least massive object , so that the most massive star typically remains as a companion to the bh ; ( iii ) the tc cross section is larger for more massive ms stars .    the characteristic timescale for the bh to acquire a binary companion is equal to the collision time with its `` target '' binary or single star .",
    "we assume that the collision cross section is dominated by gravitational focusing , which is likely the case in all gc cores (  8.4 in bt ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath27 and we average the collision rate over a maxwellian velocity distribution with 3d dispersion @xmath18 for the targets . for exchange interactions with primordial binaries the collision time is then @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the binary fraction in the cluster core , with stellar density @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the maximum distance of closest approach for an exchange to occur , comparable to the binary semi - major axis @xcite .    for tidal captures of single stars ,",
    "the collision time is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the _ maximum _ closest - approach distance for the capture to occur . for a @xmath34m@xmath15 bh and a @xmath35m@xmath15 ms star",
    ", we estimate @xmath36r@xmath15 by extrapolating the results of @xcite .",
    "note that the final fate of tc binaries is very uncertain .",
    "previously discussed tc scenarios invovling nss or white dwarfs have run into many difficulties .",
    "problems have been pointed out about the tc process itself , which , because of strong nonlinearities in the regime relevant to gcs , is far more likely to result in a merger than in the formation of a long - lived binary ( kumar & goodman 1996 ; mcmillan et al .",
    "1990 ; rasio & shapiro 1991 ) . moreover , the basic predictions of these tc scenarios are at odds with many observations of binaries and recycled pulsars in gcs ( bailyn 1995 ; shara et al .",
    "1996 ) . for bhs , which are even more massive and produce an even stronger tidal perturbation",
    ", it is likely that tc does not lead to bh xrbs .",
    "nevertheless , we take it into account for completeness .",
    "tc events with red giants ( rg ) can lead to bh with low - mass degenerate cores as companions on a timescale comparable to tc with ms stars ( lower fraction of rg among single stars [ @xmath37% ] is compensated by larger @xmath33 [ @xmath38 ) .",
    "such low - mass companions would be easily replaced by ms stars in a subsequent interaction and would lead to wide binaries similar to those produced by exchange interactions .",
    "we now turn to the evaluation of these interaction timescales ( eqs .  [ 4 ] and [ 5 ] ) for typical dense gcs .",
    "it is useful to consider three representative cases for cluster properties .",
    "the first case corresponds to a fairly dense , but non - core - collapsed cluster , such as 47  tuc , with a central density @xmath39pc@xmath40  @xcite .",
    "we adopt a binary fraction @xmath41 , typical of dense gcs with resolved cores ( albrow et al .",
    "such a cluster is thought to support itself in a state of quasi - static equilibrium against gravothermal contraction by primordial binary `` burning ''  @xcite .",
    "the binaries most likely to interact with a bh in the cluster core are the widest among the surviving ( hard ) systems , which have @xmath42au .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath43yr .",
    "this short timescale implies that a bh will have had multiple exchange interactions during the recent gc dynamical history and that it would be very unlikely for a bh not to have a binary companion in this kind of environment .",
    "for the same cluster parameters , the tc time is @xmath44yr , implying that this process is less important than exchange interactions , but could also have happened .",
    "next we consider a more extreme environment typical of a `` core - collapsed '' cluster such as ngc  6397 , with a central density @xmath45pc@xmath40 .",
    "most binaries are expected to have been destroyed or ejected from the cluster , so we adopt @xmath46 as a typical value , consistent with observations  @xcite . since the few surviving binaries will have been hardened considerably  @xcite , we take @xmath47au .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath48yr , while the tc time in this case is @xmath49yr . assuming that a star can survive tc by a bh",
    ", these results once again imply that it would be unlikely for the bh not to have a companion , but in this case tc would dominate over exchanges .",
    "last we consider an even denser cluster similar to m15 , with a central density @xmath50pc@xmath40  @xcite . in this case",
    "no primordial binaries are expected to have survived in the cluster , so we assume @xmath51 and exchange interactions are unimportant ( although wide binaries may still form through tc with red giants ) .",
    "the tc time becomes @xmath52yr and implies an extremely high rate of tidal interactions .",
    "we estimate the duration of any mass - transfer phase as a fraction of the timescale for replacing the bh companion through dynamical interactions .",
    "we also consider whether x - ray emission is persistent or transient ( within the viscous disk instability model ) .",
    "we are then able to estimate an effective x - ray _ duty cycle _",
    "( @xmath53 ) .",
    "@xmath53 values close to unity , imply a high probability of detecting a bh xrb , since @xmath54 would correspond x - ray emission being `` on '' throughout its lifetime , even though the bh may go through several companions .",
    "in all three cases of gc properties considered above we find interaction timescales much shorter than typical gc ages ( @xmath55yr ) .",
    "thus recent companions are most important , and these will have masses comparable to the current to mass @xmath56 .",
    "post - exchange binaries are relatively wide , with separations @xmath57 ( where @xmath31 is defined in eq .",
    "[ 4 ] ; they are also eccentric , but tidal circularization is very likely before the onset of mass transfer ) .",
    "this is simply from energy conservation , accounting for the higher bh mass , and in agreement with the results of detailed scattering experiments ( j.  fregeau , private communication ) .",
    "therefore bh companions acquired through exchanges may not always encounter roche lobe overflow .",
    "when they do , this will typically occur on the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "for gcs like 47  tuc , where the typical post - exchange orbital separation is @xmath58au , the x - ray lifetime would be much shorter than the rgb lifetime @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , the widest post - exchange binaries may well be destroyed by another interaction ( removing the companion ) before the onset of mass transfer . as an example , consider a binary with a @xmath60 to star and a @xmath61 bh : the roche lobe radius is @xmath62 , so that no mass transfer occurs if @xmath63au . for @xmath64au , the mass - transfer duration is only @xmath65yr  ( for a metallicity @xmath66 ; * ? ? ? * ) .    in tighter systems with post - exchange separations @xmath67au ( through interactions with very hard binaries in a denser gc like ngc  6397 ) , to stars could fill their roche lobes soon after the interaction .",
    "a strict upper limit to the duration of the mass transfer is then set by the rgb lifetime @xmath59 of the stellar companion to the bh . for a 0.8m@xmath3 star , we have @xmath68yr .",
    "this is still shorter than the interaction timescale @xmath69yr estimated for a cluster like ngc  6397 .",
    "therefore , _ for all clusters where exchanges are important _ ( or post - exchange - like binaries are formed through tc with red giants ) , we find @xmath70 .",
    "next we consider the disk stability in post - exchange mass - transfer binaries with orbital separations in the range @xmath71au ( orbital periods @xmath72d ) .",
    "it has been shown that such wide binaries with a mass ratio @xmath73 should be transient systems  @xcite .",
    "although theoretically it is difficult to estimate the transient duty cycles , observationally it appears that all systems with more than one outburst have duty cycles @xmath74 , and for wide binaries it may be even lower  @xcite .",
    "such low duty cycles imply that the probability of detecting a wide bh xrb as an x - ray source ( during an outburst ) in a gc is vanishing .",
    "even if we adopted an optimistic average value of @xmath75 for all galactic gcs , the overall duty cycle @xmath76 would be compatible with the absence of any detection in the @xmath77 galactic gcs .",
    "in contrast to post - exchange binaries , tc binaries are expected to form systems with very short orbital periods .",
    "taking the typical closest - approach distance for tc to be 3r@xmath15 , we find the orbital period of the circularized binary to be @xmath4hr .",
    "such tight binaries would contain small accretion disks , heated significantly by irradiation .",
    "for the low - mass ratios relevant to bh xrbs of interest here , it has been shown that the disks are stable throughout the mass transfer phase ( see , e.g. , middle panel of fig .  1 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore we would expect tc bh xrbs to be persistent x - ray sources .",
    "in these binaries , mass transfer is thought to be driven by magnetic braking initially , and gravitational radiation when the companion mass decreases below @xmath78m@xmath3 .",
    "typical x - ray lifetimes of such systems are estimated to be @xmath79yr  @xcite .",
    "based on this estimate and the timescales computed in the previous section we expect the effective x - ray duty cycle of such binaries to be @xmath80 . at face value",
    "this result would imply that , in any dense gc containing at least one  @xmath8 bh , a tc bh xrb should have been detected as a bright , persistent x - ray source . the absence of any such detection could be used to argue against the existence of any bh in these clusters .",
    "however , a more reasonable conclusion is that , although tc of ms stars by a bh can occur at very high rates in dense gc cores , no stable binary can form through this process .",
    "we have examined the dynamical and mass transfer evolution of bh xrbs that could possibly form in gcs , if @xmath0 bh remains in each cluster after @xmath81yr . for a wide range of cluster properties representative of dense galactic gcs",
    ", we have found that ( i ) post - exchange bh xrbs should have extremely low x - ray duty cycles , but ( ii ) bh xrbs formed through tc should be persistent bright x - ray sources .",
    "we concluded that tc can not form long - lived xrbs and that our theoretical expectations for exchange interactions are then consistent with the absence of any detected bh xrb in galactic gcs .",
    "conversely , a future detection of a bh xrb at the center of a gc would imply that either wide binaries with low mass ratios can have disks with high x - ray duty cycles ( if the period of the observed system were at least a few days ) or that tc can in fact lead to long lived bh xrbs ( if the observed period were @xmath82hr ) .",
    "if tc of a ms star by a bh does not form a binary , one may ask what , if any , might be the observable consequences of such an event ? for a @xmath83 bh and typical gc velocity dispersions , we expect very little mass loss on a hydrodynamic timescale",
    ". thus , if the ms star is disrupted , essentially all its mass will remain bound to the bh , in a rapidly rotating torus  ( as in collisions with a ns ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the hydrodynamic timescale @xmath84fewhr , the gas will settle in hydrostatic equilibrium . on a much longer angular - momentum - transport timescale @xmath85 , accretion onto the bh will commence .",
    "unless @xmath85 is extremely long ( @xmath86  yr ) , the accretion rate @xmath87 must be highly super - eddington , and the mass will probably be ejected with speed @xmath88  @xcite . for realistic @xmath85 ,",
    "@xmath89 easily exceeds the gc escape velocity , leading to the complete disruption of the ms star and ejection of the gas after a very brief x - ray phase ( @xmath90yr based on simple energetics for a bh accretion efficiency @xmath73 ) .",
    "we have focused here on old gcs like those found in our galaxy , where the absence of bh xrb is well established ( cf .",
    "recent claims for bh xrbs in gcs of elliptical galaxies ; sarazin et al .",
    "2003 ) . in younger gcs",
    ", bh companions would be more massive , possibly leading to post - exchange binaries with persistent x - ray emission and high detection probability .",
    "such conditions could explain the recent _ chandra _ observations of large numbers of bright x - ray sources associated with young gcs and with x - ray luminosities above the eddington limit for a ns(e.g .",
    "we have not considered in detail a _ binary _ bh system that could be retained at the end of the bh evaporation phase ( see colpi et al .",
    "we expect that interactions with normal stars will lead to rapid hardening of the binary . in principle",
    ", such a process can result either in a final bh merger , or in the ejection of a tight bh binary through classical or relativistic recoil ( hence the absence of a bh xrb ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the merger timescale due to gravitational radiation  ( see eq .  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) becomes shorter than the collision timescale ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) long before the binary can reach high enough recoil velocities ( @xmath91kms@xmath92 ) .",
    "the result would be a binary merger , and the estimates presented here would still apply .    finally , we note that our results can be scaled to imbh ( @xmath93m@xmath15 ) .",
    "post - exchange binaries would be extremely wide ( @xmath94au for @xmath95au ) , and strong hardening would be necessary for xrb formation .",
    "tc binaries would have circularized to periods @xmath4d , and , if they exist , they would be transients with very low duty cycles  @xcite .",
