    "recent observation [ 1 , 2 ] of the luminosity of type ia supernovae wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , sloan digital sky survey , etc . indicate an accelerated expansion of the universe and the surveys of clusters of galaxies show that the density of matter is very much less than the critical density .",
    "this observation leads to a new type of matter which violate the strong energy condition .",
    "the matter content responsible for such a condition to be satisfied at a certain stage of evaluation of the universe is referred to as dark energy [ 3 - 6 ] .",
    "most of the dark energy models involve one or more scalar fields with various actions and with or without a scalar field potential [ 7 ] .",
    "now , as the observational data permits us to have a rather time varying equation of state , there are a bunch of models characterized by different scalar fields such as a slowly rolling scalar field , k - essence , tachyonic field , chaplygin gas , a phantom model [ 8 - 12 ] etc . in a phantom model , we have the equation of state as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . the simplest type of phantom model is a scalar field having a potential v(@xmath2 ) with negative kinetic energy [ 13 ] . the condition @xmath3 is named as the phantom divide .",
    "there are even models which can smoothly cross this phantom divide [ 14 ] . currently constrained by the distance measurements of the type ia supernova , and",
    "the current observational data constrain the range of equation of state as @xmath4 [ 15 ] .",
    "+ the discovery of hawking radiation of black holes in the semi - classical description black hole behaves like a black body and there is emission of thermal radiation .",
    "the temperature of a black hole is proportional to its surface gravity , and the entropy is also proportional to its surface area [ 16 ] . the hawking temperature is given as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the surface gravity of a black hole and the entropy of a black hole is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is its surface area .",
    "at the apparent horizon , the first law of thermodynamics is shown to be equivalent to friedmann equations [ 17 ] if one takes the hawking temperature and the entropy on the apparent horizon and the generalized second law of thermodynamics ( gslt ) is obeyed at the horizon . if our universe can be considered as thermodynamical system [ 18 ]",
    ", the thermodynamical properties of the black hole can be generalized to space - time enveloped by the apparent horizon or the event horizon .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of the universe may be similar to those of the black hole .",
    "several authors [ 19 ] investigated the properties thermodynamical laws for different dark energy models .",
    "+ in this work , the general descriptions of first law and gsl of thermodynamics ( using gibb s law ) are investigated on the apparent horizon and event horizon of the universe .",
    "then we investigate the thermodynamical properties of an accelerated expanding universe driven by dark energy with the variable equation of states of the form @xmath9 .",
    "recently , zhang et al [ 20 ] have examined the validity of first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics for @xmath10 . here",
    "we discuss the thermodynamic behavior by considering another three different parametrizations , describing the well known dark energy components : ( i ) @xmath11  [ 21 ] ; ( ii ) @xmath12  [ 22 ] and ( iii ) @xmath13  [ 23 ] .",
    "these choices of @xmath14 are recently shown to be in good agreement with current observations in different ranges of @xmath15 .",
    "the main motivation of the present work is that the first law and the gsl of thermodynamics are valid or not in the dark energy filled universe which is bounded by the apparent and event horizons . in the three types of",
    "well known dark energy models , we have examined the validity of the thermodynamical laws in diagrammatically .",
    "finally we have drawn some interesting conclusions .",
    "the einstein field equations for homogeneous , isotropic and flat frw universe are given by    @xmath16    and @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the hubble parameter ( choosing @xmath19 ) .",
    "the density @xmath20 and pressure @xmath21 of the dark energy are connected by the continuity equation    @xmath22    if @xmath23 be the equation of state of the dark energy then the above equation can be written as    @xmath24    here we ll first present the general discussions of the conditions of the validity of first law and gsl of thermodynamics on the apparent and event horizons ( which is also presented in our previous works [ 24 ] ) .",
    "next , we examine the laws are valid or not on the apparent and event horizons for different dark energy models .",
    "+ now we consider the frw universe as a thermodynamical system with the horizon surface as a boundary of the system . to study the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics through the universe we deduce the expression for normal entropy using the gibb s law of thermodynamics [ 25 ]    @xmath25    where , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively entropy , pressure , volume and internal energy within the apparent / event horizon and @xmath28 is the temperature on the apparent horizon ( @xmath29)/event horizon ( @xmath30 ) . here",
