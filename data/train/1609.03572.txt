    "over the past decade , multi - wavelength observational surveys and cosmological simulations of galaxies have greatly improved our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "observations of colors , morphology , spectral type , and star formation of galaxies show a clear bimodality in the population , where _ blue _ star - forming galaxies are separated from _ red _ quiescent galaxies .",
    "one key unknown is how and when galaxies stop forming stars and become `` red and dead '' .",
    "the classical picture for red , early - type galaxies is that they form in a single - burst very early in the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "this theory was successfully challenged . by looking at spectral indices of galaxies , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "found that early - type galaxies span a large range of ages and thus showed that blue galaxies can become red via different mechanisms occurring at different times and masses . since then",
    ", other parameters have been studied to explain the variety of histories observed .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) explored the ages and metallicities of red galaxies and found correlations with not only stellar mass , but also radius , velocity dispersion , and surface brightness .",
    "furthermore , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite observed that the path to quiescence is strongly correlated with central surface density .",
    "how and when star - forming galaxies move to the red sequence is however still a matter of debate .",
    "a combination of different physical processes can explain the evolution of luminosity functions and color - magnitude diagrams ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "passive evolution of the @xmath6 quiescent population has been disfavored to explain the age - mass and metallicity - mass relations of local galaxies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite find negligible evolution in the metal content of massive galaxies at @xmath7 and ages consistent with passive evolution ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution are a powerful tool ( see @xcite for a review ) . in these models ,",
    "galaxies are fed by cold flows of gas , stars , and dark matter which generate episodes of star formation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "when galaxies ( or their dark matter haloes ) reach a certain critical mass , a virial shock is created , slowing down the cooling rate and the galaxy star formation rate decreases .",
    "this is commonly referred to as `` mass quenching '' ( @xcite ) because the mechanism responsible for the decrease in star formation happens at a certain critical mass .",
    "other physical processes invoked to quench galaxies are feedback events ( e.g. , agn and stellar feedback ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , environmental effects ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , and morphological transformations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    by connecting observations of galaxies with predictions from simulations , we can attempt to understand the mechanisms that lead galaxies to quiescence .",
    "for example , @xcite managed to reproduce the observed correlations between the stellar population parameters , age and metallicity , and the structural parameters , size and velocity dispersion , of early - type galaxies using a semi - analytic model based on the bolshoi cosmological simulation .",
    "other methods to compare simulations and observations are based on identifying the progenitors of galaxies and infer the processes involved in the transformation from one population to the other ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the strength of this technique is the ability to assess the evolution of galaxies in a model independent way . @xcite and @xcite show , however , that the large variety of stellar and dark matter assembly histories in cosmological simulations can not be captured by constant number density analyses .",
    "another method is to infer galaxy star formation histories from the fossil record of their past stellar populations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , sampling wide ranges of stellar masses and redshifts .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite measure the sfhs of massive early - type galaxies and find that these systems are very old , forming the bulk of their mass in the first 12 gyr .",
    "for our work , we choose this strategy , and we therefore need a large dataset that samples the variety of galaxies in the universe and accurate models of their spectral energy distributions .",
    "we already used a similar approach in @xcite where we assessed the sfhs of local ( @xmath8 ) galaxies .    the cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; @xcite , @xcite ) provides us with deep photometric data from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) optical and near - infrared cameras ( acs and wfc3 ) .",
    "these photometric data are carefully matched with ground - based observations from the @xmath9 to the @xmath10 band and with _ spitzer_/irac photometry up to 8@xmath11 .",
    "such a catalog is the optimal dataset to sample a large range in galaxy properties with sufficient statistics .    to interpret large , multi - wavelength datasets like candels",
    ", we have developed a comprehensive spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting tool ( @xcite ) that relies on physically motivated models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "instead of relying on simple parametric forms for galaxy star formation histories ( sfhs ) and assuming galaxies do not evolve in metallicity , as is generally done , our model is based on a combination of star - formation and chemical enrichment histories from hierarchical simulations of galaxy formation . even though our model seds are based on such histories ,",
    "our results are not biased by the particular model adopted .",
    "such sfhs provide a large variety of possible galaxy evolutionary paths and thus the parameter space sampled by the models is much larger than traditional approaches .",
    "this is particularly evident when comparing model and observed colors of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of an evolving metallicity is crucial to overcome the degeneracy between age and metallicity when interpreting the colors of galaxies .",
    "in addition to adopting complex sfhs , our models incorporate nebular emission and state - of - the - art models of the spectral evolution of stars , gas , and dust , spanning a very wide range in the space of star formation rates ( sfrs ) , metallicities , and dust and gas properties .",
    "they thus have the power to constrain the sfhs of different populations of galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "for example , assuming simple functional forms for the sfhs where the metallicity is fixed and the sfr can only decline with time does not allow one to sample properly the colors of all galaxies , especially the youngest ones , and thus correctly interpret their seds .",
    "key to distinguishing quiescent galaxies from dusty , star - forming ones is the treatment of dust attenuation in sed models .",
    "it has been shown that the attenuation by dust is more complex than the single attenuation law that is typically assumed ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for studies on different dust attenuation curves ) . thus , building on the work by @xcite , in our sed modeling , we implement a two - component dust model that spans a variety of attenuation laws .    combining the candels dataset and our new approach , we focus on red , quiescent galaxies and measure average sfhs as a function of stellar mass and redshift .",
    "we can thus answer questions such as : what are the average shapes of the sfhs of quiescent galaxies ? do these shapes change with redshift and stellar mass ?",
    "does the formation time of quiescent galaxies vary with stellar mass ? at what time and at what stellar mass do galaxies stop forming stars ? with these questions answered , we can then place important constraints on the main mechanisms involved in the formation and evolution of quiescent galaxies .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] we present the details of the observational dataset .",
    "the sed modelling approach , fitting procedure , and selection of quiescent galaxies are described in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : assembling ] we show how we create median sfhs of galaxy populations as a function of stellar mass and redshift . in section  [ sec : results ] , we show that stellar mass and redshift regulate the quenching of star formation . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we place the constraints on the mechanisms involved in the evolution of quiescent galaxies .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : concl ] .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a chabrier initial mass function ( imf , @xcite ) and a standard @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we use _ hst_/wfc3-f160w - selected catalogs from the candels survey ( @xcite ) in the goods - south ( @xcite ) and goods - north ( barro et al .",
    ", in preparation ) fields .",
    "these fields are similar in terms of wavelength coverage and depth .",
    "they cover a combined area of 329 arcmin@xmath16 on the sky .",
    "multi - wavelength photometry is measured using tfit , following @xcite .",
    "the photometry includes a maximum of 17 and 18 measurements in goods - south and goods - north , respectively ( we will discard galaxies with less than 10 measurements , see section  [ sec : fitting ] ) .",
    "these are from space - based and ground - based observations , sampling from @xmath9 to _ spitzer_/irac . in goods - north , the catalog includes also observations in the _",
    "hst_/wfc3-f275w band .",
    "these cover the central part of the field providing ultraviolet fluxes for 14% of the galaxies .",
    "filters and depths are listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "photometric redshifts are derived by combining the results of different photometric - redshift codes , as explained in @xcite .",
    "these redshifts and their uncertainties are then used as priors by our sed - fitting code ( see section  [ sec : fitting ] ) .    the total number of galaxies in the goods - south and goods - north catalogs are 34,930 and 35,445 , respectively , totaling 70,375 .",
    "we account for the ` class star ' and ` no use ' flags in the catalog and we are left with 64,175 galaxies .",
    "we select galaxies with @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 is _ hst_/wfc3-f160w ) to balance between acceptable signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath19 ) and the inclusion of faint galaxies .",
    "this reduces the number to 36,378 galaxies .",
    "we then select the galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 , which samples roughly 8 gyr in the lifetime of the universe . with this cut ,",
    "we are left with 27,722 galaxies .",
    "we will discuss mass - completeness limits and the selection of quiescent galaxies in section  [ sec : fitting ] and [ sec : sample ] , respectively .",
