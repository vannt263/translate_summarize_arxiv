    "magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj s ) consisting of two ferromagnetic layers separated by the insulating spacer exhibit the tunneling magnetoresistance effect ( tmr ) when they are switched by applying a magnetic field from the antiparallel to parallel alignment of magnetizations in magnetic layers .",
    "the tmr effect was first observed by m.  julliere in 1975 @xcite .",
    "julliere found that the tunneling conductance of the trilayer structure fe / ge / co depended on the angle between magnetizations in the fe and co layers .",
    "the measured amplitude of the tmr in these experiments was 14% at 4.2k .",
    "only 20 years later , the large values of tmr at room temperature were obtained in magnetic junctions comprising the al@xmath2o@xmath3 barrier @xcite . since that time",
    ", there has been a renewed technological and fundamental interest to the tunneling phenomenon and during the last decade a lot of experimental and theoretical papers were published on this topic ( see reviews [ 5,6,7,8 ] ) .",
    "experimentally it was observed @xcite that the tmr depends critically on the material of the insulating barrier and on the conditions of its preparation , in particular on the imperfections of the interfaces between the metal and the insulating layer @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the first theory suggested by m.  julliere expresses the tmr ratio in terms of the effective spin polarizations @xmath4 and @xmath5 of two magnetic layers via the expression @xmath6 , and thus predicts no dependence of the tmr on the parameters of the barrier . in spite of julliere s formula",
    "is widely used for the interpretation of the experimental data @xcite , it does not have rigorous theoretical foundation @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the tmr magnitude on the parameters of the tunnel barrier and the metal / insulator interface was taken into account in the subsequent theories .",
    "slonczewski @xcite considered a quantum mechanical problem of tunneling of a free electron through a simple spatially uniform barrier and showed that the tmr ratio depends on the height of the potential barrier and on the effective mass of the tunneling electron inside the insulator .",
    "later on , the influence of spin - flip scattering at the interfaces on temperature and bias - voltage dependences of the tmr was investigated by zhang _",
    "et al . _",
    "it was shown that mixing of spin - up and spin - down tunnel channels leads to a decrease of the tmr .    due to a permanent progress in the development of different methods of ab - inito calculations of the electronic properties of solids , in the last four years",
    "the transport properties of tunnel junctions were investigated using the realistic band structure of the ferromagnetic layers and the insulator ( refs .",
    "[ 1420 ] ) .",
    "the systems where the conductance was calculated were ideal epitaxial fe / znse / fe(001 ) @xcite and fe / mgo / fe(001 ) tunnel junctions @xcite .",
    "for these structures the electron transport is assumed to be ballistic , i.e.  the electron momentum @xmath7 parallel to the ferromagnet / insulator interface is conserved .",
    "experimentally it was also demonstrated recently by heinrich _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that fe / mgo / fe(001 ) junctions can be indeed grown by depositing the mgo epitaxially onto a fe whisker and then depositing another fe electrode epitaxially on a top of the mgo .",
    "the results of ab - initio calculations showed that tunneling has more complicated behavior than the predictions of the simple barrier model proposed by slonczewski @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows @xcite .",
    "( i )  tunneling conductance depends strongly on the symmetry of the electron states in the ferromagnetic electrodes and in the insulating layer .",
    "( ii )  the decay rates of evanescent states in the barrier are different for the states with different symmetry .",
    "the slowest decay rates have the evanescent states which are compatible with @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the bloch states in the metal couple more efficiently through the interface with the decaying states of the same symmetry in the barrier .",
    "therefore , mostly free - like @xmath8-electrons from the bands with @xmath0 character in the ferromagnet give the essential contribution to the tunneling conductance .",
    "( iii ) for thin insulating layers the tunneling current in the minority channel is dominated by the interfacial resonance states that gives rise to `` hot spots '' for the @xmath7-resolved conductance in the surface brillouin zone .",
    "the contribution from the resonance states is substantially suppressed for the thicker barriers since the bloch states at `` hot spots '' have no @xmath0 character @xcite . moreover , as it follows from recent discussions @xcite , the surface resonance states are very sensitive to the details of the interface .",
    "the asymmetry of the potential barrier and the interfacial roughness considerably reduce the contribution from the surface states to a total conductance .    nowadays the ab - initio calculations of the tmr are possible only for ballistic junctions like above mentioned fe / znse / fe and fe / mgo / fe structures which are characterized by a small lattice mismatch between the metal and the insulator , and by the well - defined band structure of the oxide or the semiconductor . in realistic junctions",
    "the electron transport has a diffuse character , i.e.  when the electron crosses the ferromagnet / insulator interface its @xmath7 momentum is not conserved . for f / o / f tunnel junctions the most successful material until now has been alumina , al@xmath2o@xmath3@xcite .",
    "the al@xmath2o@xmath3 tunnel barriers are usually fabricated by the natural or plasma oxidation of the al layer @xcite . the subsequent structural analysis , e.g.  with the use of the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy , shows that alumina is amorphous and the obtained alo@xmath9 tunnel barrier deviates from the ideal al@xmath2o@xmath3 structure @xcite . for a uniform coverage the al film thickness",
    "is usually ranged from about 7 to 18   , depending on a type of the ferromagnetic electrode @xcite .",
    "there is a small range of al thicknesses that yields to the best tmr ratio for a given oxidation condition . when the al layer is thin , the ferromagnet surface becomes oxidized leading to the formation of coo and co@xmath3o@xmath10 oxides @xcite or to the fe@xmath3o@xmath10 oxide @xcite . on the other hand , with too thick al film",
    ", an excess of al metal is left unoxidized .",
    "the amorphous barriers , the roughness of the interface and its structural inhomogeneity make the rigorous ab - initio calculations of the tmr virtually impossible and therefore more simplified models are required to treat the diffuse electron transport in mtj s .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we attempted to investigate the influence of scattering processes of the electrons ( with and without spin - flip ) at the interfaces on the tmr using a simple two - band ( spin - up and spin - down ) free - electron model .",
    "it was shown that for this simplified model spin - conserving scattering may or may not lead to a decrease of the tmr depending on the amplitude of the scattering potential . in this paper , we proceed to study the diffuse electron transport in magnetic tunnel junctions of the from f / o / f with f s being 3@xmath1 transition metal electrodes and o being the insulating barrier ( al@xmath2o@xmath3 ) .",
    "we use the results of ab - initio calculations to model the band structure of ferromagnetic electrodes , namely , the most important feature of these calculations that at least two groups of electrons form the total band structure : the almost free - like spin - up and spin - down bands and the narrow strongly exchange split bands .",
    "we will call the first group @xmath0 and the second group @xmath1 electrons and will consider that a periodic part of the @xmath0-@xmath1 hybridization between bands is taken into account that results in the nonequivalence of spin - up and spin - down @xmath0-bands .",
    "the parameters of the adopted model can be adjusted to reproduce a value of the tmr observed in the experiments .",
    "we assume that for the case of al@xmath2o@xmath3 barrier the exchange split @xmath0-like quasi - free electrons give the main contribution to the tmr effect . in the framework of this simplified model",
    "we will be able to investigate in a proper way the influence of electron scattering at the interfaces on the tunneling conductance .    to describe the nonideal tunnel junction we assume that defects and impurity centers ( the al or o ions , or other artificially embedded ions ) are randomly distributed within few monolayers near the f / o interface .",
    "within the interface , an electron undergoes scattering when it comes to the defect or impurity center .",
    "we take into account these processes assuming that the hybridization between @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands changes randomly on the interface because of this parameter is the most important in the adopted model among the other ones , characterizing the scattering potential .",
    "it yields to the possibility of @xmath0-like electrons to scatter into the @xmath1 sub - band ( and vice versa ) and thus strongly affects tunneling . to treat the electron scattering on the random potential we use the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite that allows to consider the case of strong scattering .",
    "we apply the generalized kubo formalism and the green s functions method to calculate the conductance of the system , and find the vertex corrections to the conductivity with the use of `` ladder '' approximation @xcite combined with the cpa .",
    "it is shown that the so - called ward identity is satisfied in the framework of this approximation that provides the necessary condition for a conservation of a tunneling current .",
    "note , that if it is not the case , the conclusions may be completely misleading . as a result ,",
    "we show that , due to substantial difference in majority and minority @xmath1 density of states at the fermi energy for 3@xmath1 ferromagnetic metals , the inter - band @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering on the interface can strongly reduce the tmr even down to zero value . in accordance with results of zhang _ et al .",
    "@xcite , it is also shown that the spin - flip scattering of electrons on the surface magnons within the interface leads to a further decrease of the tmr ratio at finite temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the model hamiltonian , the calculation of the tunneling conductance and vertex corrections .",
    "the discussion of the obtained results is presented in sec .",
    "conclusions are in sec .",
    "the proof of ward identity is given in appendix a. the details of the derivation of the cpa equations are described in appendix b.",
    "we will consider a trilayer tunnel junction of the form f@xmath11/o",
    "/ f@xmath3 , where f@xmath11 and f@xmath3 are two semi - infinite ferromagnetic layers and o is a dielectric oxide spacer ( al@xmath2o@xmath3 ) .",
    "our arguments in behalf of the two - band @xmath0-@xmath1 model which was briefly described in the introduction are as follows .",
    "one of the conclusions of ab - initio calculations of the tmr for ballistic tunnel junctions @xcite is that the expected spin - dependence of the tunneling current can be deduced from the symmetry of the bloch states in the ferromagnet at the fermi energy .",
    "spin - polarized band structure for bcc fe , fcc ni , and fcc co can be found in ref .  [ 26 ] .",
    "the type and symmetry of the bloch states for different crystal faces with @xmath12 for fe , co and ni are presented in table  i ( in accordance with ref .  [ 18 ] ) .",
    "for example , in case of fe electrodes , the examination of the band structure shows that both the majority and minority bands with @xmath0 character in [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) cross the fermi energy . for [ 100 ]",
    "direction the band with @xmath0 symmetry ( @xmath15 ) crosses the fermi energy in case of the majority channel only .",
    "the similar analysis can also be performed in case of ni and co. thus one can assume that in the polycrystalline fe , co or ni - based films the states with @xmath0 character present for both spin directions and the bloch states will couple efficiently through the f / o interface with @xmath0 states in the insulator and will decay with the equal rates in the barrier region .",
    "we will call the electrons from these bands as @xmath0-like electrons and will describe them as free electrons with the effective mass @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is a bare electron mass ) and with different fermi momenta @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for up and down spins . the idea about a dominant contribution of the mostly itinerant electrons to tunneling",
    "was originally proposed by m.  stearns @xcite and explained the positive polarization of the spin - dependent current in the experiments on tunneling with the superconductors @xcite . according to estimations of stearns @xcite , in the case of fe , @xmath21  @xmath22 , @xmath23  @xmath22 .    .",

    "the fermi momenta @xmath33 and @xmath34 of @xmath1-like electrons can be chosen to reproduce the typical for 3@xmath1 transition metals ratio of the values of spin - up and spin - down @xmath1 density of states at the fermi energy @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xcite . in accordance with the band structure of fe , co and ni @xcite the narrow majority and minority",
    "@xmath1-bands are practically filled .",

    "we note , that the aim of this work is to calculate the relative change of the tmr due to scattering .",
    "therefore the proposed model is rather adequate for this purpose since the scattering rate depends mostly on the density of states and on the matrix elements of the scattering potential .",
    "the al@xmath2o@xmath3 tunnel barriers obtained by oxidation of the al film are amorphous @xcite . concerning the @xmath42-al@xmath2o@xmath3 crystals , it is known from the band structure calculations @xcite that the gap ( which is not direct ) between the upper valence band and the conduction band is of the width of @xmath43  ev .",

    "the top of the valence band consists of hybridized o 2@xmath25 and al 3@xmath25 orbitals . in a view of that",
    ", one can describe the conduction and valence bands of the amorphous al@xmath2o@xmath3 by isotropic quadratic laws with effective masses",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 .    next",
    ", the @xmath0-like electrons from the ferromagnet can easily penetrate into the oxide since the lead bands with @xmath0 character can couple efficiently with @xmath0 states in the barrier , and the tunneling conductance , caused by the specular transmission of the bloch waves through the interface , will decay for both spin - up and spin - down @xmath0-channels with the same law as   @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath52 is the width of a barrier , @xmath53 is a bottom of the conduction band and @xmath54 is the electron momentum parallel to the f / o interface .",

    "we proved that adopted approximations lead to the physically correct results , namely , the non - local conductivity tensor is a constant function and , therefore , a tunneling current is conserved .",

    "the reason of the suppression of the magnetoresistance is the indirect contribution of negatively polarized @xmath1-like electrons to the tunneling current due to strong scattering to the @xmath0 band on the interface .",

    "<S> the generalized kubo formalism and the green s functions method were used to calculate the conductance of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex corrections to the conductivity were found with the use of `` ladder '' approximation combined with the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) that allowed to consider the case of strong electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the ward identity is satisfied in the framework of this approximation that provides the necessary condition for a conservation of a tunneling current . </S>",
    "<S> based on the known results of ab - initio calculations of the tmr for ballistic junctions , we assume that exchange split quasi - free  @xmath0-like electrons with the density of states being greater for the majority spin sub - band give the main contribution to the tmr effect . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , due to interfacial inter - band scattering , the tmr can be substantially reduced even down to zero value . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the fact that delocalized quasi - free electrons can scatter into the strongly localized @xmath1  sub - band with the density of states at the fermi energy being larger for minority spins compared to majority spins . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that spin - flip electron scattering on the surface magnons within the interface leads to a further decrease of the tmr at finite temperature . </S>"
