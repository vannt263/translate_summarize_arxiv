    "the precision observation of large - scale structure of the universe now plays a very crucial role in scrutinizing the standard cosmological model that has emerged recently based on the multiple cosmological observations . amongst various cosmological issues , one important",
    "subject is to clarify the origin and nature of cosmic acceleration , first discovered by the distant supernova observations @xcite .",
    "the cosmic acceleration may be originated from the dark energy , or rather it may indicate the breakdown of general relativity on very large scales . to observationally explore this ,",
    "the measurements of both the cosmic expansion and the growth of structure are thought to be essential , giving us a chance to test gravity on cosmological scales or to constrain dark energy equation of state ( e.g. , @xcite for review ) .",
    "the large - scale structure observations with galaxy redshift surveys indeed offer an opportunity to measure these two quantities simultaneously .",
    "the key measurements are the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) , imprinted on the large - scale clustering pattern of galaxy distribution . with bao as a standard ruler",
    ", we can simultaneously measure the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter at the distant galaxies through the alcock - paczynski effect ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , rsd caused by the peculiar velocity of galaxies",
    "induces apparent clustering anisotropies , whose strength is related to the growth rate of structure formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since",
    "both bao and rsd are now reliably and simultaneously measured through the clustering statistics of galaxy distribution ( e.g. , @xcite for recent measurements ) typically on scales close to the linear regime of gravitational evolution , the precision estimation of power spectrum and/or correlation function is a major priority of the ongoing and upcoming galaxy surveys",
    ".    with increasing interests in precision measurements , accurate theoretical modelings of power spectrum and/or correlation function is crucial and is essential to correctly estimate the geometric distances and structure growth , taking full account of the nonlinear systematics including gravitational clustering and rsd .",
    "development of theoretical templates is thus an important research subject , and there have been numerous numerical and analytical studies along this line @xcite . thanks to these efforts , we are now able to discuss the accuracy of theoretical template at a percent level .",
    "however , one important remark is that the calculation of such templates , especially for the prediction of gravitational clustering , heavily relies on the underlying theory of gravity .",
    "so far , general relativity ( gr ) has been implicitly assumed as the underlying theory of gravity in most studies . as a consequence , although such templates can be employed for consistency tests of gr , their use for characterizing or detecting deviation from gr gravity can be limited .",
    "further theoretical developments are therefore required in a wide context of modified gravity models . while a model - independent approach , in which we do not assume gravity but rather parametrize it in a fairly generic way ( e.g. , @xcite ) is very helpful and",
    "should be exploited , most of the approaches proposed so far have been restricted to the linear regime . since the applicable range of linear theory calculation is known to be rather narrower at lower redshifts , our ability to constrain or test such models is expected to be significantly reduced @xcite .    in this paper , we attempt to extend the framework of theoretical templates to deal with modified theories of gravity . here , we specifically examine this issue based on the analytical approach with perturbation theory calculations , relevant for the measurement of bao and rsd on large scales .",
    "previously , we have presented the basic formalism to treat general modified gravity models @xcite , and in specific gravity models , we have computed power spectra in both real and redshift spaces based on the standard perturbation theory ( pt ) @xcite .",
    "the standard pt is , however , known to produce a poorly convergent series expansion , and because of the bad high-@xmath0 behavior ( e.g. , @xcite ) , difficulty arises in computing the correlation function through a direct integration of power spectrum .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall apply the specific resummed pt scheme referred to as the multipoint propagator expansion or @xmath3 expansion @xcite .",
    "the building blocks of this pt scheme are the multipoint propagators , with which the non - perturbative properties at high-@xmath0 can be efficiently resummed , giving us an improved convergence of the pt expansion . in the case of gr , making full use of the analytical properties , the regularized propagators , which consistently reproduces both the standard pt results at low-@xmath0 and the expected resummed behaviors at high-@xmath0 , have been successfully constructed @xcite , and the @xmath3 expansion has been applied to the predictions of real- and redshift - space power spectra and correlation functions , showing a very good agreement with @xmath2-body simulations @xcite . clearly , a crucial point for applying this approach to the modified gravity models is whether we can systematically construct regularized propagators in a semianalytic manner . here , we specifically show that while there appear non - trivial corrections originating from the screening mechanism in modified gravity model , in the case of @xmath1 gravity model for a currently constrained model parameter , these corrections are basically small .",
    "thus , in @xmath1 gravity , the propagator can be constructed in a similar manner to the gr case .",
    "then the analytically computed propagators are compared with @xmath2-body simulations , and a good agreement is found . with these propagators as building blocks , we will proceed to the calculation of the power spectrum and correlation function in both real and redshift spaces .",

    "then , a resummed pt scheme with multipoint propagator expansion @xcite is briefly reviewed , and the properties of these multipoint propagators are mentioned .      in this paper , we are particularly interested in the evolution of matter fluctuations , ignoring a tiny contribution of massive neutrinos . inside the hubble horizon , the so - called quasi - static approximation may be applied , and the time derivatives of the perturbed quantities can be neglected compared to the spatial derivatives . in gr , based on this approximation , we can find the newtonian correspondence , and the standard poisson equation is recovered . on the other hand , in modified theory of gravity ,",
    "the poisson equation is generically modified due to a new scalar degree of freedom , referred to as the scalaron . on large scales , the scalaron @xmath4 mediates the scalar force , and behaves like the brans - dicke scalar field without potential and self - interactions , while it should acquire some interaction terms on small scales , which play an important role to recover gr and to evade the solar - system constraints .",

    "the dgp braneworld model is another modified gravity model that has a screening mechanism .",
    "the dgp model is the 5d gravity theory with the induced 4d gravity on a brane in which we are living .",
    "thus , on large scales larger than the characteristic scale @xmath68 , the gravity becomes @xmath69 , while on small scales , gravity becomes @xmath70 , but it is not described by gr . as a result , the friedman equation is modified on the brane @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 represents two distinct branches of the solutions ( @xmath73 is the self - accelerating branch , and @xmath74 is called the normal branch ) .",
    "notable point in the dgp model is that the gr is recovered via the vainshtein mechanism , by which the scalaron becomes massless , but acquires a large second - order derivative interaction .",

    "this is the so - called standard pt treatment @xcite . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the standard pt is known to produce a poorly convergent series expansion , and is difficult to compute the correlation function because of the bad uv behavior .    alternatively , we may first introduce the non - perturbative statistical quantities , and expand the statistical quantities for our interest in terms of these . the multi - point propagator expansion or",
    "the @xmath3 expansion is one such pt expansion , and is regarded as a resummed pt treatment , in which the standard pt expansion is reorganized by the non - perturbative quantities @xcite .",
    "a key property is that all the statistical quantities such as the power spectra and bispectra can be reconstructed by an expansion series written solely in terms of the multipoint propagators .",
    "the multi - point propagator is a fully non - perturbative quantity , and with this object , a good convergence of the pt expansion is guaranteed .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the standard pt expansion .",

    "( [ eq : pk_regpt ] ) , the nonlinear effects in the power spectrum are wholly encapsulated in the multi - point propagators , and thus the construction of the propagators keeping their non - perturbative properties is quite essential in the analytic treatment of pt .",
    "therefore , subsequent sections are devoted to the discussion on how to analytically construct the propagators in the context of modified gravity . section [ sec : resummed_prop_eikonal ] discusses the non - perturbative high-@xmath0 behavior of the propagators based on the eikonal approximation , and section [ sec : regularized_pk ] presents a consistent construction of the _ regularized _ propagators which satisfies both the expected high-@xmath0 and low-@xmath0 behaviors .",

    "the structure formation is enhanced at small scales due to the presence of the scale - dependent linear growth , and it produces a larger peculiar velocity . although the screening mechanism should terminate the enhanced structure growth at some nonlinear scales , it is still ineffective at the scales of our interest .    finally , fig .",

    "[ fig : xired_tns ] look reasonable , and one expects that the pt results quantitatively describe the impact of both the nonlinear gravity and rsd around baryon acoustic peak .",
    "it suggests that in @xmath1 gravity , the acoustic peak is significantly smeared out , and the peak amplitude is largely suppressed relative to the linear theory prediction . the resultant shape and amplitude look rather similar to those in gr .",
    "hence , taking full account of these nonlinear effects would be essential in constraining the modified gravity from the observed correlation functions .",
    "while the standard pt treatment fails to compute the correlation function , at sufficiently large scales and high redshifts , it still provide a reasonably accurate prediction of the power spectrum .",

    "@xcite , we used the standard pt to compute the real- and redshift - space power spectra in @xmath1 gravity , and a good agreement with @xmath2-body simulation was found at @xmath172 .",
    "it is thus interesting to see how much the standard pt results are different from our regpt treatment .    to compare with the standard pt results , we adopt the same cosmological parameters as used in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the power spectra at @xmath172 are computed with the regpt treatment in both real and redshift spaces .",

    "overall , both of the pt results reproduce the @xmath2-body trend reasonably well at @xmath173mpc@xmath149 , but a closer look at the real - space power spectrum reveals that the regpt gives a moderate nonlinear enhancement or suppression of the power spectrum amplitude , and it seems to better describe the smearing effect on bao .",

    "indeed , the @xmath2-body results of the quadrupole power spectrum is better described by the regpt prediction . to see this",

    "the statistical error @xmath177 is estimated from the cosmic variance error assuming the hypothetical survey with volume @xmath178gpc@xmath179 ( see appendix b of ref .",

    "are shown in the panel , clearly showing that the regpt prediction gives a good performance , and reproduce the @xmath2-body results quite well .",
    "note that the @xmath181 value smaller than unity does not implies that the model overfits the simulations because the statistical error @xmath182 adopted here does not reflect the actual error in @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "although the differences of the pt prediction between standard pt and regpt is small at one - loop order , a better description of acoustic feature in power spectrum is rather crucial in simultaneous measurement of geometric distances , and the regpt procedure provides a more accurate theoretical template from which one should be able to obtain unbiased parameter estimations .",
    "future precision observations of large - scale structure enables us to not only give a useful cosmological constraint on dark energy but also offer a new possibility to probe the theory of gravity itself that describes both the dynamics of cosmic expansion and the growth of large - scale structure . toward an unbiased cosmological constraint ,",
    "it is therefore crucial to develop accurate theoretical templates of large - scale structure observations . in this paper , beyond consistency test of gravity from a precision measurement of bao and rsd , we presented an improved pt prescription of the power spectrum and correlation function in modified gravity models .",
    "based on the resummed pt scheme with @xmath3 expansion , we first construct a resummed propagator that partly includes the non - perturbative effect in the high-@xmath0 limit . while the resultant propagator in the high-@xmath0 limit contains corrections arising from the screening mechanism , we explicitly show that in the case of @xmath1 gravity with a currently constrained model parameter , the impact of this term is fairly small . thus , in @xmath1 gravity , the regularized propagators , that reproduce both the resummed high-@xmath0 behavior and the low-@xmath0 results computed with standard pt , are successfully constructed in a similar manner to the gr case , taking account of the nonlinear modification of gravity valid at large scales .",
    "then , the analytically calculated propagators have been compared with the measured results in @xmath2-body simulations . at one - loop order ,",
    "the analytic predictions reproduces the measured propagators quite well , and a good agreement with @xmath2-body simulations was also obtained for the analytic power spectrum and correlation function expressed in terms of the regularized propagators .",
    "furthermore , employing a specific mode of rsd , the improved pt prescription has been shown to successfully describe the redshift - space observables .",
    "for the power spectrum at one - loop order , while a performance of our improved pt treatment apparently looks very similar to that of the standard pt prediction , nonlinear modulation of bao seen in @xmath2-body simulations is better described by our improved pt predictions , showing that the resummed pt developed here is better suited for an unbiased cosmological constraints from bao measurements .    finally , while the explicit pt calculations presented here have focused on a specific modified gravity model , the resummed pt prescription developed in this paper , as well as the framework to treat pt calculations , are quite general , and",
    "can be applied to a wide class of modified gravity models .",
    "this is at least true for models with chameleon - type screening mechanisms within the current observational bounds .",
    "rather , with the improved pt prescription presented here , we will be able to put a more stringent constraint on modified gravity from a precision measurement of bao and rsd .",
    "for instance , the @xmath1 gravity of the functional form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fr_husawicki ] ) or ( [ eq : fr_model_nbody ] ) is currently constrained to @xmath153 , from the rsd measurement with sdss dr7 luminous red galaxy sample @xcite .",
    "while this is roughly comparable to the one obtained from cluster abundance @xcite , there are now much larger galaxy samples such as boss dr11 cmass sample , from which we will get a much more severe constraint on @xmath1 gravity .",
    "note also that the template used in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the fitting formula , which does not properly account for the nonlinear modulation of bao coming from both the gravity and rsd .",
    "hence , with the new pt template and the model of rsd presented here , a robust and unbiased cosmological analysis will be made possible . in doing this , however , a careful study of the galaxy biasing is needed .",
    "indeed , the halo clustering properties in @xmath1 gravity has been found to systematically differ from those in gr ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since even in the gr",
