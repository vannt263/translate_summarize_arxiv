    "the entanglement entropy is a common language connecting among various fields such as quantum information , quantum gravity , and condensed matter physics .",
    "the main reason of this wide applicability comes from a fact that the entropy picks up universality irrespective of details of their models .",
    "the entropy represents the amount of information across the boundary between a subsystem @xmath2 of linear size @xmath3 and its environment @xmath4 . starting with a wave function of the total system @xmath5",
    ", we first define the density matrix of @xmath2 by @xmath6 , which traces out degree of freedom inside of @xmath4 .",
    "then , the entanglement entropy @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 it has been extensively examined how this entropy behaves as functions of @xmath3 and spatial dimension @xmath9 .",
    "a well - known formula is called area - law scaling , @xmath10 , which tells us non - extensivity of @xmath11 in contrast to the thermal entropy .",
    "this formula was originally introduced in a context of black - hole physics ( bekenstein - hawking entropy )  @xcite , and examination of the scaling and its violation has been a hot topic in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the violation occurs in cases of one - dimensional ( 1d ) critical systems and models with fermi surface . in these cases ,",
    "the scaling contains logarithmic correction , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is related to the number of excitation modes across the boundary between @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and is equal to the central charge @xmath14 of conformal field theory ( cft ) in @xmath15 . in the cft , the entropy is roughly given by a logarithm of a two - point correlation function for scaling operators , and thus eq .",
    "( [ cft ] ) naturally appears .",
    "away from a critical point , the entropy is deformed as @xmath16 with correlation length @xmath17 and the number of boundary points @xmath18 of @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , there is another type of entropy scaling which does not contain the universality parameter @xmath14 and any length scale explicitely .",
    "when we take 1d quantum critical models by using variational optimization of matrix product state ( mps )  @xcite , it is conjectured that the half - chain entanglement entropy behaves as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is matrix dimension of mps .",
    "this conjecture was recently found in two specific models with different central charges , respectively : one is transverse - field ising chain ( @xmath21 ) , and the other is @xmath22 @xmath23 chain with uniaxial anisotropy ( @xmath24 )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 dependence on this entropy can be interpleted as a result of quantum entanglement between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "this is because @xmath26 for the maximally entangled - pair state , @xmath27 , where the states in @xmath2 and @xmath4 are labeled by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and one of the two degrees of freedom , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , is traced out . here",
    ", @xmath5 is also a particular form of mps .",
    "furthermore , a prefactor @xmath30 is expected to be a character of the virasoro algebra in cft , although the microscopic understanding has not been obtained yet .    in general , mps for @xmath31 represents local approximation ( no entanglement , @xmath32 ) , and is asymptotically exact if we could take a sufficiently large @xmath20 value .",
    "then , approximately taking a finite @xmath20 value would limit spin correlation or quantum entanglement to finite - range one . in that sense",
    ", @xmath20 controls the range of the spin correlation . by combining eq .",
    "( [ mps ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ deformed ] ) , we know that the effective correlation length of mps is given by @xmath33 where we take @xmath34 because eq .",
    "( [ mps ] ) is obtained for the half of an infinitely - long chain .",
    "therefore , this @xmath20 value is actually related to the length scale that represents how presicely the spin correlation is taken into account . however ,",
    "this is somehow strange , since @xmath20 is just a parameter for how many singular values of the matrices in mps are taken .",
    "the above consideration suggests that the length - scale control given by eq .",
    "( [ issue ] ) is a fundamental function of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) .",
    "the issue to be resolved here is why the svd automatically produces the length scale .    here",
    ", we address this issue in a viewpoint of quantum / classical correspondence .",
    "usually , a 1d quantum spin model is transformed into a 2d classical spin model by the suzuki - trotter decomposition .",
    "then , we can handle a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , and obtain a snapshot of particular spin configuration .",
    "the correspondence may predict that a length scale characterized by @xmath20 in the quantum side is hidden in the snapshot .",
    "therefore , we attempt to search the hidden length scale , and discuss about physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ issue ] ) .",
    "this is a purpose of this paper .    for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce new entanglement entropy for a snapshot calculated by a mc simulation .",
    "this is the von neumann entropy defined by the singular values of the reduced density matrix for the snapshot .",
    "then , we find two scaling relations of the entropy in the ising and the @xmath0-state potts models that are analogous to eq .",
    "( [ deformed ] ) ( or eq .  ( [ cft ] ) ) and eq .  ( [ mps ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the scaling also appears on the positions of the multiple gaps in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "a key factor for the scaling is fractal spin configuration at @xmath1 .",
    "the two scaling relations come from short- and long - range spin correlation in the fractal .",
    "a role of the svd on the length - scale control is to decompose the original snapshot into a set of images with different length scales , respectively .",
    "then , each scale is characterized by one of the multiple gaps in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "we discuss about similarity and difference between the new entropy scaling and standard one in 1d quantum systems , and also discuss about possible presence of a topological term hidden in our scaling relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the entanglement entropy for a snapshot , which is a key ingredient in this paper , and present outline of our method .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , basic properties of the entanglment entropy and the entanglement spectrum for square - lattice ising ferromagnet are presented .",
    "the main objective is to show temperature and system - size dependence of the entropy as well as the spectrum in order to extract scaling relations .",
    "we also examine entanglement support of our method by changing the number of the singular values which are taken into account . in sec .",
    "iv , coarse - grained snapshots are shown , and we discuss about the key mechanism of the length - scale control hidden in the svd . in sec .",
    "v , we examine the @xmath0-state potts model in order to confirm universality of our scaling relations obtained in the analysis of the ising model . in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss about the topological entanglement entropy in a viewpoint of the entanglement gap .",
    "finally , we summarize our results .",
    "we start with the ising model on the square lattice : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and the sum runs over the nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is exchange interaction .",
    "the system size is taken to be @xmath39 . according to dual transformation",
    ", the critical temperature is known to be @xmath40 .",
    "the central charge of the ising model is @xmath21 .",
    "first , we are going to obtain a snapshot of a spin configuration @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "we can freely choose a method for obtaining the snapshot .",
    "here , we will use mc simulation .",
    "we regard @xmath43 as a matrix , and calculate the reduced density matrices defined by @xmath44 where we trace over @xmath45 ( @xmath46)-component in @xmath47 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "let us decompose @xmath43 into a set of the sigular values @xmath48 and the column unitary matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 mathematically , @xmath48 are uniquely determined , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 are not .",
    "thus if some universal features could be extracted from a snapshot , those should be represented by a function of @xmath54 . by substituting eq .",

    "we align the eigenvalues so that @xmath59 .",
    "each eigenvalue @xmath54 is normalized to be @xmath60 with a constant @xmath13 so as to satisfy @xmath61    next , we define the von neumann entropy of a snapshot analogous to eq .",
