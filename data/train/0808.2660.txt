    "stochastic models that describe the evolution of aligned dna sequence sites are fundamental to most modern approaches to phylogenetic tree reconstruction @xcite .",
    "making these models more realistic usually requires introducing additional parameters .",
    "however , this raises the prospect that one might lose the ability to estimate a tree if one has to rely on the data to estimate all the parameters in the model .",
    "this could occur for various reasons  for example , it may be that two different trees could produce exactly the same probability distribution on site patterns for two appropriately selected settings of the other parameters in the model .",
    "such a scenario would be a problem for any method of tree reconstruction ( including maximum likelihood and bayesian methods ) as it would mean that in some cases , one could not distinguish between two trees even with infinitely long sequences . this loss of statistical ` identifiability ' has been demonstrated for certain types of dna substitution models , including rates - across - sites models @xcite and , more recently , simple mixture models @xcite . on the positive side ,",
    "a number of identifiability results have also been established for suitably constrained models ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in this paper , we are interested in a phenomenon that is related to , but different from the loss of statistical identifiability , since it is method - dependent .",
    "we will describe a situation where pairwise sequence comparison methods can fail to distinguish between trees , even though more sophisticated methods such as ml can .",
    "thus , the models are statistically identifiable , as far as the tree parameter is concerned , but only if one uses the full matrix of aligned sequence information and not just pairwise sequence comparisons .",
    "specifically we consider tree reconstruction when sequences sites evolve under a model in which site rates have a gamma distribution , but where the ( shape ) parameter of the gamma distribution is not known . in this case , if one uses all the aligned sequence data , or at least @xmath0way sequence comparisons then , for dna sequences one can recover the shape parameter in a statistically consistent way , and thereby the underlying phylogenetic tree , by a recent result of allman and rhodes @xcite .",
    "however if one just uses pairwise sequence comparisons we show that that two different trees can produce exactly the same pairwise sequence comparisons ; moreover this can happen for any different choice of shape parameters for the two trees ( by selecting the branch lengths on the two trees appropriately ) .",
    "the intuition behind this limitation on pairwise sequence comparisons has been nicely summarized by felsenstein ( @xcite , p. 175 ) : the rate at which a site is evolving affects all the taxa , but this constraint is not reflected by a method that is based on pairwise comparisons , and so , for example ,  once one is looking at changes within rodents it will forget where changes were seen among primates . \"    before describing our results we mention some earlier papers that described related by different phenomena . baake @xcite considered a model in which half the sites are invariable and the remaining sites evolve under a general markov model .",
    "although this model ( and the tree ) is generically identifiable using all the sequence information ( as recently shown in @xcite ) baake showed that two trees can produce identical pairwise sequence comparisons .",
    "the non - indentifyability of divergence times on a fixed tree under various rates - across - sites models has also been recently investigated by evans and warnow @xcite .",
    "finally we note that our result that distance - based methods can be misleading for tree inference complement some earlier work @xcite , @xcite which highlighted a different result in which distances can perfectly ` fit ' one phylogenetic tree when the full sequence data support a different tree .",
    "in sequence - based approaches to phylogenetics , the data usually consists of a collection of @xmath1 sequences @xmath2 , each of length @xmath3 , and where each sequence site takes values in some state space .",
    "we will suppose that there are @xmath4 states , and denote them by greek letters @xmath5 throughout - for example , for aligned dna sequence data @xmath6 and the state space is the four dna bases ( a , c , g , t ) .",
    "given the aligned sequences , biologists seek to infer a phylogenetic tree @xmath7 , whose leaves are labeled by @xmath8 and which describes the evolution of the sequences from some unknown common ancestral sequence ( leaf @xmath9 corresponds to the extant taxon from which sequence @xmath10 has been obtained ) .",
    "for further background on phylogenetics , the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "given two sequences @xmath11 and @xmath12 let @xmath13 be the @xmath14 matrix whose @xmath15entry is the proportion of sites where sequence @xmath10 is in state @xmath16 and sequence @xmath17 is in state @xmath18 .",
    "the proportion of sites where sequence @xmath10 and @xmath17 differ , @xmath19 ( the normalized sequence dissimilarity ) is therefore the sum of the off - diagonal entries of @xmath13 ; more formally , @xmath20 where @xmath21 refers to matrix trace ( the sum of the diagonal entries ) .    given a collection of sequences @xmath2",
    ", each of length @xmath3 , one can easily derive the collection of pairwise @xmath22matrices @xmath23 .",
    "this reduction process , from aligned sequences to pairwise comparisons , is highly redundant ( for typical values of @xmath1 ) since it reduces the frequencies of @xmath24 site patterns to @xmath25 comparisons of @xmath26 sites pattern frequencies .",
    "the further reduction to the @xmath27 values involves even more redundancy @xcite . despite this",
    ", it is well known that these reduced matrices ( and sometimes just the @xmath27 values ) provide a statistically consistent way to estimate the underlying tree , under simple models of dna site substitution .",
    "this follows by combining two well - known facts .",
    "* fact one : * under the assumption that the aligned sequence sites evolve i.i.d . , the law of large numbers tells us that the @xmath13 matrices ( and thereby the @xmath19 values ) converge in probability to their expected values as the sequence length @xmath3 becomes large .    to explain this further we introduce two key definitions : for @xmath28 , let @xmath29 be the expected value of @xmath13 ",
    "thus , @xmath29 is an @xmath14 matrix whose @xmath15entry is @xmath30 for each pair of states @xmath5 , and any given @xmath31 ; and let @xmath32 for any given @xmath31 . in words , @xmath29 is the matrix whose entries describe the joint probability that at any given site the sequences @xmath10 and @xmath17 are in specified states , while @xmath33 is simply the probability that these states are different at a given site . by definition , @xmath34    with this notation ,",
    "fact one can be restated as the condition that , for all @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes convergence in probability as @xmath38 .    the second result required to show that the @xmath13 values estimate the tree consistenty is that for many models the @xmath29 values can be transformed to obtain a function on pairs of leaves that is additive .",
    "recall that a function @xmath39 on pairs of leaves of a tree is said to be _ additive _ on a tree @xmath7 if one can assign a positive real number @xmath40 to each edge @xmath41 of @xmath7 so that @xmath39 is the sum of the numbers assigned to the edges on the path connecting the two leaves on the tree .",
    "that is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the edges on the path in @xmath7 connecting @xmath9 and @xmath44 .",
    "this additivity condition implies that the tree @xmath7 can be uniquely recovered from the @xmath45 values ( see e.g. @xcite ) . with this in mind",
    "we have :    * fact two : * under various models of sequence site evolution , a distance function @xmath46 on @xmath47 that is additive on the underlying tree can be computed from the @xmath48 matrices ( and sometimes just the @xmath49 values ) .    the two main models for which fact two is known to apply are ( i ) the general markov process , for which the transformation @xmath50 is additive , and ( ii ) the general time - reversible ( gtr ) model with any known distribution of rates across sites .",
    "in this latter case  which is the one of interest in this paper  one can transform the @xmath48 matrices to obtain an distance function @xmath46 on @xmath47 that corresponds to the expected number of substitution ( ` evolutionary distance ' ) between @xmath9 and @xmath44  and which is therefore additive . for a gtr model , with a distribution @xmath51 of rates across sites",
    "this transformation @xcite is : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the moment generating function of the distribution of rates across sites , and where @xmath54 is the diagonal matrix whose leading diagonal is the vector @xmath55 $ ] of the frequencies of the @xmath4 states . for the gtr model ( or any submodel )",
    "the matrix @xmath29 is symmetric @xcite and @xmath56 for each @xmath9 .",
    "combining fact one and fact two gives : @xmath57 and so the @xmath13 values allow us to reconstruct the underlying tree from sufficiently long sequences .",
    "indeed even if we do nt know the stationary frequencies of the states ( the matrix @xmath58 ) we can still recover the tree , since @xmath58 is determined by ( the row sums of ) @xmath29 , and so if we let @xmath59 denote the corresponding empirical state frequencies ( determined by the corresponding row sums of @xmath13 ) then we have : @xmath60    thus , if for each pair @xmath61 we derive an estimate @xmath62 of evolutionary distance ( @xmath39 ) by either maximum likelihood estimation or by the ` corrected distance ' formula : @xmath63 then these estimated values will converge to the true @xmath39 values as the sequence length @xmath3 grows , allowing for statistically consistent reconstruction of the tree by using fast distance - based tree reconstruction methods .    for some gtr models",
    "it is also possible to transform just the @xmath19 to obtain @xmath39  for example , under the simple symmetric 4-state model ( the jukes - cantor model ) the transformation is : @xmath64 for models in which @xmath39 can be expressed as a function of @xmath33 one can use @xmath27 in place of @xmath49 to estimate @xmath39 ( for certain models , such as the jukes - cantor model , this leads to the same @xmath39 estimates as a pairwise maximum likelihood estimate , but for more complex models this need not be the case ) .",
    "the snag in this otherwise appealing story is that it assumes that we know the distribution @xmath51 of rates across sites  what happens if @xmath51 is unknown or has parameters that require estimation ?",
    "if no constraints are placed upon @xmath51 then identifiability of the tree can be completely lost @xcite .",
    "it is therefore fortunate that in molecular systematics @xmath51 is typically described by a simple parametric distribution . in particular",
    ", the gamma distribution has a long and popular history in models that describe the variation of substitution rates across dna sequence sites @xcite .",
    "today , a common default option is the ` gtr+@xmath65+i ' model in which each site is either invariant ( with some probability ) , or it evolves according to a general time reversible markov process that proceeds at a rate selected randomly from a gamma distribution . in this paper we will ignore the invariable sites , since our main result ( theorem [ mainthm ] ) will automatically imply a corresponding result when invariable sites are present .",
    "moreover , we may ( without loss of generality ) assume that the gamma distribution is normalised so that its mean is equal to @xmath66 and so there remains just one parameter - the ` shape ' parameter , @xmath31",
    ".    we will show that _ any _ two different shape parameters can provide exactly the same @xmath48 matrices on a pair of topologically distinct trees ( with appropriately assigned branch lengths ) .",
    "consequently , using just pairwise comparisons ( the @xmath22 matrices ) to infer phylogeny from the resulting data , without prior knowledge of the shape parameter is potentially problematic  either of the two trees could describe the data much better than the other if one were to select the shape parameter appropriate for that tree .",
    "thus , a biologist exploring data by seeing the effect of varying @xmath31 might note that for one value of @xmath31 his / her data fit a tree perfectly .",
    "the result described here shows that it could be dangerous to stop at this point and report the tree , as there may well be another value of @xmath31 for which the pairwise sequence data ( or distance data ) fit a different tree perfectly .",
    "using all the data ( i.e. not reducing to pairwise comparisons ) will overcome this problem for a gamma distribution as established recently by allman and rhodes @xcite ( who also pointed out errors in an earlier approach from @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we consider a particular type of reversible stationary markov process , called the _ equal input model_. in this model , the rate of substitution does not depend on the current state , and when a substitution event occurs , the new state is selected according to the stationary distribution of states , which we encode by the vector @xmath67 . thus the rate matrix @xmath68 is defined by the condition @xmath69 for all @xmath70 . in the case of @xmath6 states ,",
    "this model has been called the ` tajima - nei equal input model ' or the ` felsenstein 1981 model ' ; when , in addition , @xmath67 is uniform , it is the known as the ` jukes - cantor ' model . for more mathematical background on the equal input model , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "although the equal - input model is a special case of the gtr model , we have chosen it because it is simple enough to allow tractable exact calculations , yet without being overly simplistic ( for example , it allows arbitrary stationary frequencies for the states ) .    under the equal input model , and with constant - rate site evolution",
    "we have : @xmath71 where @xmath39 is the expected number of substitutions on the path connecting @xmath9 and @xmath44 in @xmath7 ( an additive distance ) and @xmath72 ( this number is the expected normalised sequence dissimilarity for saturated sequences  for example , in the jukes - cantor model , it takes the value @xmath73 ) . more briefly we can write : @xmath74 where @xmath75 are constants that depend on the pair @xmath5 and the vector @xmath67 .",
    "if we now impose an associated distribution @xmath51 of rates across sites on this equal - input model , in which case each site evolves according to the same equal input model , but with a rate selected randomly according to @xmath51 . in this case",
    "( [ jj ] ) becomes : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the moment generating function for @xmath51 , and when @xmath51 is a gamma distribution of rates across sites with shape parameter @xmath31 and mean @xmath66 we have : @xmath78 and so eqn .",

    "<S> provided the ( shape ) parameter of this distribution is known , the method can correctly reconstruct the tree . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the shape parameter is not known then we show that topologically different trees , with different shape parameters and associated positive branch lengths , can lead to exactly matching distributions on pairwise site patterns between all pairs of taxa . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one could not distinguish between the two trees using pairs of sequences without some prior knowledge of the shape parameter . </S>",
    "<S> more surprisingly , this can happen for _ any _ choice of distinct shape parameters on the two trees , and thus the result is not peculiar to a particular or contrived selection of the shape parameters . on a positive note , we point out known conditions where identifiability can be restored ( namely , when the branch lengths are clocklike , or if methods such as maximum likelihood are used ) .    </S>",
