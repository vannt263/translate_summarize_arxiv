    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has overwhelming evidences as the right theory of strong interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "it successfully describes hard processes of hadrons , such as the scaling behaviors of structure functions , and the positron - electron annihilation cross sections @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd gives nonperturbative properties of the vacuum , such as color confinement , quark condensate and so on , which are consistent with properties of low lying hadrons .",
    "some ( but not all ) properties of hadrons , i.e. , masses , are now available directly from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "qcd also suggests fascinating possibility of phase transitions of the vacuum at finite temperature and/or baryon density @xcite .",
    "a dedicated accelerator has just begun to look for evidences of such phase transition @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "applications of qcd to rich phenomena of low energy hadrons are not in bloom yet .",
    "so far , hadronic interactions have been studied mostly in phenomenological approaches .",
    "the most prominent example is the nuclear force .",
    "state - of - art @xmath2 potentials , which are valid to relatively high energy ( @xmath3 gev ) , are available in the market @xcite .",
    "they are based on the meson exchange picture , which has been developed in these fifty years since yukawa proposed the pion exchange interaction @xcite , and phenomenological short - range part , which should be attributed to the dynamics of quarks and gluons inside the baryon @xcite .",
    "although it is highly desirable to establish a foundation of such potentials from the qcd viewpoint , no immediate resolution is expected at this moment .",
    "recent development of hypernuclear physics has lead us to the level that the interactions of hyperons , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and so on ( collectively denoted by @xmath7 ) , can be fairly well studied from the observed spectra of hypernuclei as well as the data from hyperon productions and reactions @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath8 interaction is somewhat weaker than the @xmath2 interaction , and its spin dependent part has new features @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 interaction is naturally regarded as a generalized nuclear force by including the third flavor , strangeness @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider a larger flavor space , i.e. , the flavor su(3 ) . in terms of su(3 ) , the systems composed of two octet baryons belong to @xmath10 irreducible representations . among them",
    "the first ( last ) three are symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under the exchange of two baryons , and therefore appear in the channels with antisymmetric ( symmetric ) spin - orbital combination .",
    "the @xmath2 systems have the hypercharge @xmath11 and thus belong to either 27 or @xmath12 representation .",
    "in other words , all the other representations are not accessible by @xmath2 , but can be reachable only by @xmath9 and @xmath13 interactions . in this sense ,",
    "study of the @xmath9 and @xmath13 interactions is important for the complete understanding of the baryonic interactions .",
    "theoretical approaches to the @xmath9 interaction are naturally to generalize the picture of the @xmath2 interaction by considering exchanges of the pseudoscalar octet , the vector octet as well as the singlet pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "again the short - range parts of the potential are given phenomenologically .",
    "much efforts have been made to analyze experimental data to draw a consistent picture of the hyperon interactions . yet",
    "the the most fundamental quantities , i.e. , the meson - baryon coupling constants , which are essential in constructing the meson exchange forces of baryons , have been treated as unknown parameters . in order to reduce the ambiguity , the su(3 ) relations of the coupling constants are often employed , which leaves a free parameter , i.e. , the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "a very popular phenomenological @xmath9 potential is the nijmegen model @xcite , which has several different versions .",
    "there the @xmath0 ratio is treated as a free parameter and varies among the different versions .",
    "however , the effect of su(3 ) breaking may well be sizable considering a wide variety of meson masses within the octet @xcite .    under these circumstances , it is highly desirable to calculate the meson - baryon coupling constants from the fundamental theory .",
    "what is the @xmath0 ratio in the su(3 ) limit ?",
    "how is the su(3 ) symmetry broken at the meson - baryon vertices ?",
    "a lattice qcd calculation may be preferable , but at this moment is still preliminary @xcite .",
    "thus alternative analytic approaches may be useful to analyze the su(3 ) symmetry structure of the couplings .    in this paper , we employ qcd sum rule approach to the coupling constants of the pseudoscalar octet mesons and the octet baryons .",
    "the qcd sum rule @xcite is generally a relation derived from a correlation function in qcd and its analytic property .",
    "the correlation function is calculated by the use of operator product expansion ( ope ) in the deeply euclidean region on one hand , and is compared with that calculated for a phenomenological parameterization .",
    "the sum rules relate hadron properties directly to the qcd vacuum condensates as well as the other fundamental constants .",
    "most applications consider two - point correlation functions of hadronic interpolating operators , and derive relations of masses and other single - particle properties of the designated hadron ( ex .  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been applied to the properties of hadrons at finite temperature and density @xcite , as well as the calculation of the scattering lengths of two hadrons @xcite .",
    "the obtained sum rules generally give predictions up to a few tens of per cent ambiguity , which may come from ambiguities of the qcd parameters as well as higher orders in ope truncation and contaminations from excited and continuum states .",
    "application of the sum rule to the meson - baryon coupling constants , ( mostly the @xmath14 coupling constant ) , was started by reinders et al .",
    "@xcite , who pointed out that the use of three point functions results in @xmath15 which is inconsistent with the goldberger - treiman ( gt ) relation .",
    "they then considered two - point correlation function with the pion in the initial state , @xmath16    \\label{eq : corr - pi}\\ ] ] and showed that the sum rule for the first nonperturbative term in ope gives the gt relation with @xmath17 .",
    "later , shiomi and hatsuda @xcite improved the sum rule in the soft - pion limit ( @xmath18 ) including higher orders in the ope . however , birse and krippa @xcite pointed out that the sum rule at @xmath18 simply reflects the result of the gt relation and does not constitute an independent sum rule from that for the nucleon mass .",
    "it can be easily shown that the correlation function ( [ eq : corr - pi ] ) is related to the correlation function without the pion in the initial state using the soft pion reduction formula . therefore in order to obtain an independent sum rule , we need to take into account finite pion momentum @xmath19 .    as the correlation function ( [ eq : corr - pi ] ) has the dirac indices ( @xmath20 ) , it has several independent terms , which give independent sum rules .",
    "kim , lee and oka @xcite investigated dependencies on the dirac structure and suggested that the tensor ( t ) structure , proportional to @xmath21 , gives the most reliable result .",
    "this conclusion was further refined by kim , doi , oka and lee @xcite .",
    "the latter also checked dependencies on the choice of the interpolating field operator for the nucleon .",
    "they found that this point is especially important in deriving the @xmath0 ratio of the coupling constants , when the formulation is extended to the su(3 ) case .",
    "recently , kondo and morimatsu proposed a novel construction of the sum rule using projected two - point correlation functions @xcite , and showed that the coupling constant can be defined without the ambiguity from the choice of the effective interaction lagrangian .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows .",
    "we first review the formulation of the qcd sum rule for the meson - baryon coupling constant in section  [ sec : formalism ] , summarizing the arguments given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : mbb - coupling ] , we formulate the sum rules for the `` baryon - diagonal '' coupling constants , such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and so on , and analyze their su(3 ) structure . in the su(3 ) limit , these couplings are related with each other",
    ". more specifically , the ratios of any two couplings are parametrized by a single common parameter , the @xmath0 ratio . as the @xmath0 ratio parametrize two",
    "allowed octet combinations in the coupling , it can not be determined by the su(3 ) symmetry alone , while requiring a larger symmetry , such as the su(6 ) symmetry of the nonrelativistic quark model , determines the ratio uniquely .    in the potential model approaches  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 ratio for each exchanged meson octet is considered as a free parameter , although it is often fixed to the value taken from the su(6 ) symmetry , or the value determined by the semileptonic decays of hyperons .",
    "the latter provides us with the @xmath0 ratio for the axialvector charges of the baryons , and thus one has to rely on the gt relation to apply it to the @xmath0 ratio of the coupling constants .",
    "clearly it is desirable to determine the @xmath0 ratio of the meson - baryon coupling constants directly from qcd only with the constraint of the su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "moreover , a careful study of the applicability of the sum rules in the su(3 ) limit will give us confidence on the sum rule analysis when the su(3 ) symmetry is broken , which is a subject of section  [ sec : mbb-coupling ] .    the projected two - point correlation functions , proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite can be applied to general meson - baryon couplings including the baryon - off - diagonal cases . in section  [",
    "sec : mbb-coupling ] , we take the @xmath1 coupling as an example and explain the projected correlation method and evaluate the sum rule for the @xmath1 coupling constant .",
    "we also study effects of the su(3 ) breaking on this coupling constant .",
    "we give a conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "reinders , rubinstein and yazaki , in their celebrated physics reports article@xcite , summarized their pioneering works on the qcd sum rules .",
    "they studied how the masses of various mesons and baryons are determined directly from qcd with the help of dispersion relation which connects operator product expansion ( ope ) of qcd operators in the deep euclidean region , which gives the ope side of the sum rule , and the realistic spectral function at the on - mass - shell region , which gives the phenomenological side .",
    "the ope side contains information of nonperturbative nature of qcd in terms of matrix elements , or condensates , of various local operators , such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they also considered how the @xmath22 coupling constant is calculated in the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "they studied two correlation functions for the sum rule , the three - point correlation function  @xcite , @xmath27 |0 { \\rangle } } , \\label{eq:3point_corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the two - point correlation function with an external meson field  @xcite , @xmath28     \\label{eq:2point_corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the momentum of the meson @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 denote local operators which interpolate the qcd vacuum and the baryon states , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 is a similar operator for the meson @xmath29 .",
    "they are called either interpolating field or `` current '' .    in principle , both the above correlation functions can be used to construct a sum rule for the coupling constant . however , in practice , the three - point correlation function has disadvantages that one has to assume the meson pole dominance and neglect the contribution from higher excited states .",
    "this assumption is not justified because the ope is valid only in the deep euclidean region of the meson momentum ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated , indeed , by maltman  @xcite that the sum rule for the @xmath22 coupling has large contamination from the excited pions , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . on the other hand , for the two - point correlation function",
    ", we may take into account the relevant meson exclusively via the corresponding meson matrix elements .",
    "kim @xcite further pointed out that the double dispersion relation used in analytic continuation of the three point function needs a special care in order to keep the consistency with the soft - pion limit , and concluded that , in the soft - pion limit , the sum rule from the three - point correlation function is reduced to that from the two - point correlation function .",
    "therefore , we adopt the two - point correlation function in the present analyses .    the phenomenological side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2point_corr ] ) contains not only the pole term which describes the designated meson - baryon coupling , @xmath38 but also the terms which represent the transitions from the ground state baryon to excited baryon resonances as well as the contribution from the intermediate states due to the meson - baryon scatterings .",
    "we call them `` continuum '' contribution hereafter .    generally speaking , it is difficult to eliminate these unwanted contributions and extract only the aimed pole term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbbpole ] ) . however , in the case of the baryon - diagonal couplings ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) it is possible to single out the @xmath41 term in the soft - meson approximation .",
    "namely , after performing the taylor expansion with respect to the meson momentum @xmath19 , the contribution from the ground state has a double pole structure as @xmath42 on the other hand , terms from the excitations of baryon resonances remain as a single pole structure , @xmath43    similarly , the intermediate meson - baryon scatterings give a single pole structure @xcite .",
    "therefore , by extracting the double pole term exclusively , we can evaluate @xmath41 without contamination .",
    "the concrete procedure will be shown in section  [ sec : mbb - coupling ] .",
    "the above technique is valid only when the masses of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are equal , or close enough compared to the baryon excitation energy .",
    "we need further elaboration for the off - diagonal couplings , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : mbb-coupling ] .    in the two - point correlation function , eq .  ( [ eq:2point_corr ] ) , we have suppressed the dirac indices coming from the interpolating field . the dirac index structure of @xmath44",
    "can be written as a sum of four independent terms allowed by the lorentz covariance , @xmath45 each of the four lorentz - scalar correlation functions , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , can be used to construct a sum rule , and should give the same result in principle . in reality , however , they often give different and sometimes contradictory results with each other .",
    "shiomi and hatsuda  @xcite calculated @xmath22 coupling in the soft - pion limit ( @xmath50 ) , which leaves only @xmath47 , the @xmath51 structure at the order of @xmath52 .",
    "birse and krippa pointed out that the sum rule from @xmath47 is reduced to the sum rule for the nucleon mass by a chiral rotation .",
    "thus they argued that it is necessary to go beyond the soft - meson limit to construct an independent sum rule for the coupling . with this remark",
    ", they adopted @xmath46 in their analysis .",
    "later , kim , lee and oka  @xcite elaborated the analysis from the viewpoint of the interaction lagrangian dependence .",
    "they pointed out that the popular choices of the @xmath53 effective interaction lagrangian , the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath54 and the pseudovector coupling @xmath55 should give the same result when the baryons are taken on their mass - shell states .",
    "in fact , the sum rule relies on the analytic continuation from far off - mass - shell kinematics , which is not guaranteed automatically .",
    "they found that the double pole term in the two - point correlation function safely satisfies the equivalence condition . from this observation , in ref .",
    "@xcite , they pointed out that @xmath49 sum rule is not appropriate because this structure appears only when we choose the pseudovector effective interaction lagrangian .",
    "later , kondo and morimatsu @xcite pointed out that defining the coupling constant by using the vertex function will avoid the ambiguity , which is consistent with that calculated from the double pole term .",
    "we first consider the diagonal meson - baryon couplings , and construct the coupling sum rules for general baryon interpolating fields @xcite . we choose the baryons , @xmath56 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the mesons , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "we note that there exist two independent interpolating fields for each octet baryon , and thus the general interpolating field is a linear combination of the two designated by a real parameter @xmath63 ( we will also use @xmath64 later ) .",
    "note that if we restrict ourselves not to use derivatives in the interpolating fields , these are the most general forms .",
    "the choice @xmath65 , often called the ioffe current  @xcite , is regarded as a good interpolating field operator for the ground state baryon . we , however , study the sum rule for general @xmath63 and will see that the @xmath63 dependence is a good check point on the validity of the sum rule .",
    "our main purpose here is to determine the pertinent dirac structure @xcite .",
    "we set the following criteria : ( 1 ) the result should be independent of the choice of the baryon interpolating field . ( 2 )",
    "the choice minimizes the single pole terms , which come from excited baryon resonances and meson - baryon scatterings .",
    "( 3 ) it should not depend on the coupling scheme of the effective lagrangian . in going beyond the soft - meson limit",
    ", we consider three distinct dirac structures : @xmath66 ( pv ) , @xmath67 ( ps ) , and @xmath68 ( t ) . for the pv and t structures , we construct the sum rules to @xmath69 . at this order , the terms proportional to the quark mass @xmath70",

    "note that the terms linear in quark mass @xmath75 should be included in the ope at this chiral order .",
    "we calculate the ope up to dimension 8 for the ps sum rule , and up to dimension 7 for the pv and t sum rules .",
    "the ope diagrams which we consider are shown in fig.[fig : mb_ope ] . in the ope calculation",
    ", we expand the meson matrix elements in terms of the momentum of the meson @xmath19 .",
    "technical details on the ope calculation are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ fig : mb_ope ]    in order to construct the phenomenological side of the sum rule , we adopt the effective interaction lagrangian with the ps type coupling .",
    "we obtain the correlation function as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the coupling strength of the single baryon state to the corresponding baryon interpolating field operator @xmath78 defined by @xmath79 and we choose the phase so that @xmath77 is real .",
    "the continuum contributions are treated approximately by assuming the qcd duality that they match the ope at above an effective threshold , @xmath80 , which is regarded as a parameter and is determined phenomenologically .",
    "the sum rule is obtained by matching the ope side with the phenomenological side and by taking the borel transformation in order to improve the predictability .",
    "the obtained sum rules are of the form , @xmath81   & = &   f^{\\mbox{\\tiny ope}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny\\it $ m$b}}(m^2;t )   \\label{eq : qsr - formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the borel mass and @xmath83 denotes the sum of the single pole terms .",
    "thus , the contamination from the single pole terms can be eliminated by fitting @xmath84 by a linear function of @xmath85 .",
    "explicit expressions of @xmath86 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we here determine the most pertinent dirac structure for the meson - baryon coupling sum rule out of the pv , ps and t structures given above .",
    "first of all , we focus on the sensitivity to the continuum threshold , @xmath80 .",
    "we often choose @xmath80 to be the position of the first excited state , but examine whether the result is not too sensitive to the choice . in the present case",
    ", we first set the threshold @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , that corresponds to the roper resonance , and @xmath89 is changed to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) to see how the sum rule is sensitive to the threshold .",
    "we find that the result from the pv sum rule changes by about 15% at the borel mass @xmath92 .",
    "we also find that the pv sum rule has a large uncertainty in the linear fitting of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qsr - formula ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ps and t structures are insensitive to @xmath89 . at @xmath92 ,",
    "the difference is only @xmath93 level , and the uncertainty in the linear fitting is also small .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the sum rule from pv structure is not reliable .",
    "kim et al .",
    ", in fact , found that this sensitivity of the pv sum rule may be understood by coherent addition of the positive and negative parity excited states @xcite .",
    "as the next step , we compare the ps and t sum rules , focusing on the dependence of the ope on the baryon interpolating field ( i.e. the dependence on @xmath63 ) . ideally , the physical parameter @xmath41 should be independent of @xmath63 , but in practice , the truncation of ope brings some spurious @xmath63-dependence .",
    "therefore , the above constraint tells us how the truncated ope calculation is reliable . in eq .",

    "this discrepancy is attributed mainly to the ambiguity brought by the mass sum rule , by which the correlation function is divided in order to eliminate the factor @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",

    "note that the @xmath0 ratio is obtained without using the mass sum rule in sect .",
    "[ subsec : f / d ] .",
    "a further discrepancy may come from the difference in the method of extracting the coupling constant .",
    "sum rules constructed by the derivative with respect to the borel mass are in general less trustable than the global borel mass fit .",
    "another source of discrepancy is the difference in the choice of the interpolating field . as was pointed out in sect .",
    "[ subsec : f / d ] , the @xmath0 ratio from the interpolating field  la ioffe ( @xmath65 ) tends to be underestimated .",
    "we indeed see in fig .",
    "[ fig : f / d - t ] that the @xmath0 ratio at @xmath65 is rather below the central value .",
    "we also suspect that the @xmath0 ratio from the projected sum rule contains some spurious @xmath63-dependence because we do not take the chiral limit and then the ope has contributions from the ps and pv structure .",
    "thus we conclude that the @xmath0 ratio obtained in the t sum rule is more reliable than that given here .",
    "the value of @xmath105 is consistent with the previous sum rule calculations , tend to give a larger value for @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "see appendix a for details . ] but it is smaller than the value determined from the strength of the one - pion exchange potential .",
    "this discrepancy is still an open problem .",
    "earlier , an attempt was made to compute the @xmath98 coupling constant using the three - point correlation function by choe @xcite , giving @xmath113 , a larger number than our result .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the @xmath114 limit is taken to evaluate the coupling constant , which , as we stressed in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , is not allowed in computing the ope .",
    "recently , lutz and kolomeitsev @xcite performed an extensive analysis of experimental data using relativistic chiral su(3 ) formulation .",
    "they have obtained the coupling constants from fitting to the scatterings data and obtain , among others , @xmath115 , which is somewhat larger than our prediction . on the other hand ,",
    "a recent coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath116 scattering has predicted much smaller value @xcite .",
    "the obtained value , @xmath117 , suggests a large su(3 ) violation , while our result is consistent with su(3 ) symmetry with @xmath118 .",
    "as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , qcd is to be applied directly to the hadronic interactions . we have presented a part of such attempts that the meson - baryon coupling constants are calculated in the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "it is shown that the coupling constants are expressed in terms of the nonperturbative qcd parameters , such as the quark condensates , gluon condensates , as well as the pion ( light - cone ) wave functions .",
    "we have addressed several technical issues in this report .",
    "( 1 ) it is advantageous to take the two - point correlation function of baryons to derive sum rules for the coupling constants . the correlation function is evaluated for the initial meson state and the final vacuum so that the coupling vertex appears in the middle .",
    "( 2 ) we have considered the analytic structures of the correlation function and have pointed out that the double pole term , one pole from the initial baryon and the other from the final baryon , is carefully taken out to evaluate the coupling constant . ( 3 ) in the case of the baryon - diagonal couplings , the double pole is easily extracted by the borel transform , and we have found that the most appropriate dirac structure in the two point function is the tensor type , proportional to @xmath119 . especially , this choice avoids spurious dependence on the choice of the interpolating field operator for the octet baryons .",
    "( 4 ) in order to derive workable sum rule for the baryon - off - diagonal couplings , we have found that the projected correlation function is most useful . among the two sum rules , even ( e ) and odd ( o )",
    ", we have found that the odd one gives the most reliable result .",
    "we have emphasized that the su(3 ) symmetry must be recovered if we turn off the quark mass differences .",
    "then the coupling constants of the su(3 ) octet mesons and octet baryons can be expressed in terms of two constants , overall constant , represented by @xmath105 for instance , and the @xmath0 ratio . because the @xmath0 ratio is a completely free parameter not determined by the su(3 ) symmetry , it is important and interesting to determine this ratio directly from qcd .",
    "we have found that the sum rule in the su(3 ) limit is fully consistent with su(3 ) and gives @xmath120 , which almost coincides with the value derived from the quark model , or the su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry , @xmath121 , or @xmath122 .",
    "this is also consistent with the @xmath0 ratio of the axialvector coupling constants obtained from the beta decay rates of the hyperons .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath1 coupling constant as an example of the baryon - off - diagonal coupling .",
    "we have found that the effect of the su(3 ) breaking is small by comparing the results in the su(3 ) limit , @xmath123 , and in the broken su(3 ) case , @xmath124 .",
    "in fact , even at the level of the ope , it can be seen that effects of the su(3 ) breaking are weak as far as the pion - baryon couplings are concerned .",
    "the su(3 ) breaking is taken into account in the qcd sum rule as the quark mass term , @xmath125 and indirectly in terms of the difference in the quark condensates , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "however , both of these contributions do not appear in the leading terms of ope for the pion - baryon couplings .",
    "thus we see that not only the @xmath1 coupling , but also the other @xmath57-baryon couplings , like @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , may not deviate much from the su(3 ) values .",
    "it is , however , not the case when we consider the couplings of the @xmath130 , and maybe @xmath131 , mesons .",
    "the sum rule involves the meson mass , @xmath132 and the decay constants , @xmath133 , in the leading terms .",
    "therefore the su(3 ) breaking of order a few tens of per cent can easily predicted in the qcd sum rule @xcite .    in future analyses , it is desirable to calculate the @xmath134 couplings , such as @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which are phenomenologically very important , for instance , in the hypernuclear physics . and @xmath137 couplings @xcite .",
