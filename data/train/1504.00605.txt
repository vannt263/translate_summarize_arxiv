    "an orientable hypersurface is said to satisfy a prescribed mean curvature equation if the mean curvature at each point of the hypersurface is prescribed by a scalar field .",
    "when this scalar field is proportional to the `` vertical '' coordinate , this equation is commonly referred as the _ capillary equation _ , since it is satisfied by a static interface between two liquid phases of different densities , where the capillary force ( proportional to the mean curvature ) has to balance the difference of pressures ( which , up to a change of the origin , is proportional to this vertical coordinate ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be an integer not smaller than @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 denote the coordinates in @xmath3 ( the `` vertical '' coordinate will be @xmath4 ) .",
    "a hypersurface of @xmath3 is axisymmetric with respect to the @xmath4-axis if , at every point of the hypersurface , the distance @xmath5 to the @xmath4-axis is a function of @xmath4 .",
    "let us introduce the angle @xmath6 as displayed on figure  [ fig_def_theta ] ( namely , satisfying @xmath7 ) .",
    "then , at every point of this axisymmetric hypersurface , the capillary equation reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a fixed real quantity .",
    "let us assume without loss of generality that @xmath9 is positive ( the vertical coordinate @xmath4 increases `` downwards '' ) .",
    "when @xmath0 equals @xmath1 equation  ( [ axisym_cap_equ ] ) governs the shape of an axisymmetric liquid pendent drop in @xmath10 .",
    "up to a change of scale ( in both @xmath11 and @xmath4 ) , we can choose whatever positive value for @xmath9 .",
    "let us make the convenient choice @xmath12 ; indeed , with this choice , equation  ( [ axisym_cap_equ ] ) can be rewritten as the following two - dimensional differential system : @xmath13    .,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    drops of finite length correspond to solutions of equation  ( [ axisym_cap_equ ] )  or equivalently  ( [ syst_rz ] )  that do not exist for @xmath4 larger than a certain value @xmath14 ( the height at the tip of the drop ) where @xmath15 vanishes .",
    "in this paper we are interested in solutions that are defined up to @xmath16 in @xmath4 , namely drops of infinite length .",
    "the main result is the following .",
    "[ main_theorem ] there exists a unique solution @xmath17 of system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) that is defined on @xmath18 ; it satisfies : @xmath19    historically , the problem goes back to p .- s .",
    "laplace @xcite , t.  young @xcite , and lord kelvin @xcite .",
    "from a modern mathematical point of view , the main contributions are due to p.  concus and r.  finn . in @xcite",
    "( see also finn s book @xcite ) they proved the existence of solutions corresponding to drops of every prescribed finite length , and studied their shapes . in @xcite , they proved the existence of a solution under the form of a function @xmath4 of the radius @xmath11 , for which @xmath20 approaches @xmath16 when @xmath11 approaches @xmath21 , thus corresponding to a drop of infinite length , and computed its asymptotic expansion when @xmath11 approaches @xmath21 .",
    "in @xcite they achieved a first step towards its uniqueness , by proving uniqueness among all singular solutions asymptotically sufficiently close to that asymptotic expansion .",
    "further steps towards uniqueness were achieved by m .- f .  bidaut - vron ( @xcite ) , who proved uniqueness under a weaker explicit criterion on the closeness to the asymptotic expansion . finally , the full proof of the uniqueness was achieved by r.  nickolov ( @xcite ) who proved that the bidaut - vron uniqueness criterion is actually satisfied by every singular solution .    in @xcite , c.  riera and the author proposed to view and study system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) as a dynamical system .",
    "this point of view , which surprisingly enough does not seem to have been adopted before , turned out to be fruitful : classical dynamical systems techniques led us to describe the dynamics of all solutions , and to recover in a simple way many results on the shape of pendent drops of finite length , together with the existence of ( at least ) one singular solution corresponding to a drop of infinite length .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide , by the same approach , a short , elementary , and self - contained proof of its uniqueness .",
    "expression of @xmath22 in system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) suggests the following change of variables : @xmath23 which corresponds to a blow - up of factor @xmath4 at depth @xmath4 , both in the directions of @xmath11 and @xmath4 , see figures [ fig_def_theta ] and [ fig_drop_phase ] .",
    "rewritten using @xmath24 variables , system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) becomes : @xmath25 which asymptotically reduces , when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 , to the two - dimensional autonomous differential system @xmath27    ) ( the time variable is @xmath28 with @xmath29 , instead of @xmath26 ) in the case @xmath30.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for which the quantity @xmath31 is conserved ( see figure  [ fig_phase_asympt ] ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath32 which shows that , up to a scale change in @xmath26 , system  ( [ syst_rz_lim ] ) is nothing but the hamiltonian system deriving from @xmath33 by the usual symplectic form on @xmath34 .    the phase portrait of system  ( [ syst_rz_lim ] )",
    "is shown ( in the case @xmath0 equals @xmath1 ) on figure  [ fig_phase_asympt ] .",
    "it admits an elliptic equilibrium at @xmath35 and no other equilibrium in @xmath36 .",
    "the hessian matrix of @xmath37 at @xmath35 reads : @xmath38 this matrix being negative definite , the point @xmath35 is a strict local maximum point of @xmath37 .",
    "you could actually check that this point is also the strict global maximum point of @xmath37 on @xmath39 .    as was extensively studied by riera and the author in @xcite , the effect of the additional `` perturbation '' term @xmath40 in the expression of @xmath41 in `` full '' system  ( [ syst_rz ] )",
    "is to take the solution away from the maximum point @xmath35 of @xmath33 when @xmath26 increases ( in other words , to decrease the value of @xmath42 along the solution ) .",
    "see figure  [ fig_drop_phase ] .    ) and corresponding behaviour in the @xmath43-plane .",
    "the tip of the drop corresponds to the final point @xmath44 of the trajectory in the @xmath43-plane . ]    using this repulsive effect of the perturbation term , the following existence result was proved in @xcite ( once repulsion is quantified , it follows from an elementary argument , namely cantor s intersection theorem ) .",
    "this result is almost identical to the existence result established by concus and finn in @xcite .",
    "[ exist_thm ] there exists ( at least ) one solution @xmath45 of system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) that is defined on @xmath18 , and every such solution satisfies : @xmath46",
    "as can be expected as this stage , the proof of uniqueness of the singular solution relies on the same `` repulsion '' effect displayed on figure  [ fig_drop_phase ] .",
    "we shall assume that two distinct singular solutions exist , then we shall prove by an elementary perturbation argument that the resulting effect of the `` additional '' term @xmath40 in system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) is to increase the distance between those two solutions , at least for @xmath26 sufficiently large , a contradiction with the fact that both must converge to @xmath35 when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 .",
    "the sole obstacle to overcome is that the perturbation argument requires an a priori estimate on singular solutions slightly more precise than : `` @xmath47 approaches @xmath35 when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 '' .",
    "what will be required is the following fist order approximation : @xmath48    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_formal ]",
    "we shall describe the ( unique ) formal singular solution ( as an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath49 ) , and observe that it matches first order expansion  ( [ 1st_ord_app ] ) . in section  [ sec_perturbation ]",
    "we shall carry on the main perturbation argument and , assuming that  ( [ 1st_ord_app ] ) holds , we shall prove uniqueness of the singular solution . in section  [ sec_matching ] ,",
    "the very same argument will be used to prove  ( [ 1st_ord_app ] )  by the way we shall actually prove that the singular solution matches the asymptotic expansion of section  [ sec_formal ] up to every order .",
    "in the following proposition , a _ formal solution _ means an expansion of the form  ( [ expr_form_sol ] ) below such that , when it is injected in system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) where the terms @xmath50 and @xmath51 are replaced by their expansions in power series of @xmath6 , then the two equations of  ( [ syst_rz ] ) hold at every order in @xmath52 .",
    "[ prop_form_sol ] system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) admits a unique formal solution of the form @xmath53 moreover ,    * expansion @xmath54 is even with respect to @xmath26 ( that is @xmath55 if @xmath56 is odd ) ; * expansion @xmath57 is odd with respect to @xmath26 ( that is @xmath58 if @xmath56 is even ) ;    replacing in system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) the quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 by their formal expansions  ( [ expr_form_sol ] ) gives : @xmath61 thus ,    * at order @xmath62 , equation  ( [ form_drdz ] ) yields @xmath63 and equation  ( [ form_dthetadz ] ) yields @xmath64 ; * at order @xmath65 , equation  ( [ form_drdz ] ) yields @xmath66 and equation  ( [ form_dthetadz ] ) yields @xmath67 .",
    "more generally , at every order @xmath56 in @xmath68 ,    * equation  ( [ form_drdz ] ) provides an expression of @xmath69 depending on @xmath70 ,  , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,  , @xmath73 ; *",
    "equation  ( [ form_dthetadz ] ) provides an expression of @xmath74 depending on @xmath70 ,  , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,  , @xmath73 .",
    "this proves the uniqueness of the expansion  ( [ expr_form_sol ] ) satisfying system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) .",
    "now assume that this expansion of @xmath59 is even up to order @xmath75 and this expansion of @xmath60 is odd up to some order @xmath75 .",
    "then ,    * if @xmath56 is even then the expression of @xmath69 provided by equation  ( [ form_drdz ] ) equals zero ; this follows from the facts that @xmath76 and that tangent function is odd ; * if @xmath56 is odd then the expression of @xmath74 provided by equation  ( [ form_dthetadz ] ) equals zero ; this follows from the facts that @xmath77 and that cosine function is even .",
    "thus expansion of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) remains even ( respectively , odd ) up to order @xmath56 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath78 denote two singular solutions of system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) ( that is , defined up to @xmath16 in @xmath26 ) ; according to theorem  [ exist_thm ] , both must approach @xmath35 when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 ) .",
    "let us write : @xmath79 since the two solutions share the same limit when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 , it follows that : @xmath80 to enforce the contradiction argument sketched in section [ sec_sketch ] , we would like to show that , if these two solutions differ , then the distance between them  that is , the size of the pair @xmath81  increases with @xmath26 . since @xmath35 is a strict local maximum point of @xmath37 , a possible approach for that is to show that the function @xmath82 decreases with @xmath26 .",
    "basically , @xmath83 from expressions  ( [ dh ] ) of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , it follows that : @xmath86 with the notation @xmath87 let us define functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 by : @xmath90 the quantities @xmath88 and @xmath89 thus measure the discards in @xmath91 and @xmath92 with respect to what these two derivatives would be if the pair @xmath93 was ( exactly ) governed by the asymptotic differential system  ( [ syst_rz_lim ] ) .",
    "since @xmath33 is a conserved quantity for this system , expression  ( [ dhdz_step_0 ] ) of @xmath94 then reduces to @xmath95 and , substituting expansions  ( [ part_r_h ] ) and  ( [ part_th_h ] ) of @xmath96 and @xmath85 in this expression , it follows that @xmath97 this leads us to compute the quantities @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it follows from system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) that @xmath98 at first glance these expressions look a bit intricate , but if we make the additional hypothesis  ( [ 1st_ord_app ] ) , that is if we assume that @xmath99 then expressions of @xmath100 and @xmath101 above yield : @xmath102 expansion  ( [ dhdz_step_1 ] ) of @xmath94 thus becomes @xmath103 and as a consequence , for all @xmath26 sufficiently large , @xmath104    on the other hand , since @xmath105 approaches @xmath106 when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 , it follows that : @xmath107 since @xmath35 is a strict local maximum point of @xmath37 , this shows , together with inequality  ( [ dhdz_final ] ) , that , for all @xmath26 sufficiently large , @xmath108 , in other words : @xmath109 the two singular solutions @xmath43 and @xmath110 are thus equal .",
    "this proves the desired uniqueness under hypothesis  ( [ 1st_ord_app ] ) .    to complete the proof of theorem  [ main_theorem ] , the sole remaining thing to prove",
    "is that hypothesis  ( [ 1st_ord_app ] ) holds for every singular solution .",
    "the following proposition states that every singular solution coincides , up to every order , with the formal singular solution defined in proposition  [ prop_form_sol ] .",
    "let @xmath113 denote a solution of of system  ( [ syst_rz ] ) defined on @xmath18 . according to theorem  [ exist_thm ] , the pair @xmath114 approaches @xmath35 when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 .",
    "since @xmath115 and @xmath116 , this proves the desired result for @xmath62 .",
    "now take @xmath56 in @xmath117 and let us consider the following two functions of @xmath26 : @xmath118 ( note that these two functions depend on the choice of @xmath56 ) .",
    "then , the definitions of the coefficients @xmath119 and @xmath120 in the proof of proposition  [ prop_form_sol ] show that the following estimates hold : @xmath121 moreover , since @xmath122 , hypothesis  ( [ 1st_ord_app ] ) holds for @xmath43 : @xmath123    to complete the proof , we will apply exactly the same approach ( and adopt the same notation ) as in previous section , the only difference being the remaining terms @xmath124 on the right - hand side of system  ( [ dapprox_dz ] ) above .",
    "let us write : @xmath125 expansions  ( [ part_r_h ] ) and  ( [ part_th_h ] ) of @xmath126 and @xmath127 hold unchanged .",
    "let use define functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 by : @xmath90 expressions of @xmath100 and @xmath101 are identical to those of previous section , except the fact that they comprise additional terms @xmath124 .",
    "thus , @xmath128 and it follows from unchanged expansion  ( [ dhdz_step_1 ] ) that : @xmath129    we are going to deduce from this last estimate that @xmath130 indeed , according to expression  ( [ dhdz_perturb ] ) of @xmath94 , there exist positive quantities @xmath131 and @xmath132 such that , for all @xmath26 superior or equal to @xmath132 , @xmath133 besides , since @xmath35 is a strict local maximum point of @xmath37 , since the hessian matrix of @xmath37 at @xmath134 is negative definite , and since @xmath135 equals @xmath136 , the quantities @xmath137 and @xmath138 do not differ , if @xmath26 is large , by more than a fixed multiplicative factor . as a consequence , there exists a positive quantity @xmath139 such that , for all @xmath26 greater than or equal to @xmath132 , @xmath140 in other words : @xmath141 but since @xmath142 approaches @xmath136 when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 , the left - hand inequality of implication  ( [ implic_h ] ) can actually not occur if @xmath143 . indeed , by contradiction ,",
    "if there existed a quantity @xmath144 superior or equal to @xmath132 such that @xmath145 then according to implication  ( [ implic_h ] ) , it would follow that , for all @xmath26 superior or equal to @xmath144 , @xmath146 a contradiction with the fact that @xmath142 approaches @xmath136 when @xmath26 approaches @xmath16 .",
    "we thus proved that , for all @xmath26 sufficiently large , @xmath147 and this finally yields the desired estimate : @xmath148 since the positive integer @xmath56 was arbitrary , this finishes the proof of proposition  [ prop_approx ] .",
