    "the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) metallic state at the half - filled landau level was observed in 1989 @xcite , which was a very important stage attracting the theoretical research interesting from the odd denominator filling fractions to the even denominators @xcite since the fqh effect ( fqhe ) was discovered @xcite .",
    "there are two strategies to do theoretical research of the fqh metallic states : one is projecting the quantum states to the lowest landau level ( lll ) first and understanding the essential physics through the trial wave functions @xcite . however , the quantum state space in the lll is tough to be dealt with in an analytical way .",
    "most researches are restricted in the numerical simulation .",
    "another approach is so - called the fermionic chern - simons theory @xcite , which gives a field theoretical way to calculate the observed properties @xcite .",
    "recently , read has explained some relations between those two different ways @xcite . in this paper , we would like to express this kind of relations more explicitly .    in understanding the prominent plateaus of fqhe",
    ", an important concept is that the fqhe of the original electrons in the external magnetic field yields the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) of the composite fermions ( cfs ) which combines the electron with an attached flux tube carrying even flux quanta @xcite .",
    "this concept is also applied to the fqh metallic states . however ,",
    "if one turns on a flux tube adiabatically , there will always be a depletion of charge in the immediate vicinity of the location of the flux tube .",
    "this is regarded as a vortex .",
    "the charge depletion was ignored in the fermionic chern - simons theory , which motivates read @xcite to improve the cf picture with an analogue to laughlin s original quasiparticle notion in which the zeros of the wave function reflect the charge depletion . according to the improved cf picture",
    ", a numerical calculation shows a very good overlap between rezagy - read trial wave function and the ` exact ' one for the small system @xcite .",
    "read also pointed out that although the original electron s kinetic energy is completely quenched in the lll , the coulomb interaction that the vortex - electron pair ( i.e. , cf ) experiences induces an effective kinetic energy then an effective mass of the cf .",
    "following this idea , we will give a semi - classical estimation of the effective mass which is very close to the numerical result for the small system which is based on an analysis of the ground state energies @xcite .",
    "the field theoretical description of the fqh metallic states is well - established by halperin , lee and read ( hlr ) in their seminal paper @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "an important prediction in their work is that there is a cf fermi surface which has been confirmed by a number of experimental works @xcite .",
    "this implies that it is possible that some kind of the modified fermi liquid theory can be held at the low temperature .",
    "the central focus after hlr s theory is whether the effective mass is divergent @xcite .",
    "the essential results in the previous development are that the divergence of the effective mass is shown in the single - cf correlation function while the divergence can be cancelled in two - cf correlation functions .",
    "the latter is gauge invariant .",
    "recently , there are two works @xcite which have a finite answer in contrast to the divergent result .",
    "the work devoted by chari , haldane and yang @xcite defines the effective mass in a gauge invariant way .",
    "however , although the effective mass defined in such a way is finite , there is no comparison to the numerical result and others because the effective mass that they calculation is cut - off dependent .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite provide a canonical transformation to the hamiltonian of the fermionic chern - simons theory and find there are two mass scales related to the effective mass and the cyclotron motion frequency , respectively .",
    "the effective mass they obtained is finite and well - fit with the numerical result @xcite .",
    "it is no wonder that the effective mass defined in ref.@xcite is finite because it is gauge invariant . however , notice that the effective mass obtained by shankar and murthy somewhat is in the single particle sense .",
    "then , one can ask that in what physical processes we could observe the finite property of the effective mass and otherwise the divergent property is shown .",
    "we work in the standard hlr model with a different gauge choice .",
    "we work on the temporal gauge ,",
    "whose advantage is that the mean - field state that the perturbative theory is based on is closer to the physical ground state .",
    "we deal with the theory in two steps .",
    "first , we would like to compare our result to the numerical result which is based on an analysis to the ground state energy @xcite .",
    "so , we consider the approximation that a cf motion in an @xmath0 non - interacting cf background .",
    "this is nothing but the hartree - fock approximation ( hfa ) . after calculating the self - energy of the cf in a simple one loop digram",
    ", one sees that the renormalized effective mass is independent of the band mass of the electron and precisely equal to the result obtained in the canonical transformation calculation @xcite .",
    "now , we could understand why the effective mass calculated by the canonical transformation is well coincided with the semi - classical estimation or the numerical calculation based on the analysis of the ground state energy because the hfa basically reflects the ground state property .",
    "the physical properties related to the ground state could be used to check the finiteness of the effective mass .",
    "furthermore , we could understand why the energy gap gives the fqhe determined by the coulomb interaction only because the effective landau level gap is @xmath1 .",
    "we point out that this effective mass in the hfa is well - defined not only at the fermi surface but also for any value of the momentum the cf carries .",
    "so , we can have an effective theory in which the mechanic kinetic energy is defined by the effective mass while the interaction between the cf and gauge field keeps no change .",
    "namely , @xmath2 is not replaced by @xmath3 in the interaction vertex while the finite effective mass serves as the ` bare ' mass in the kinetic term .",
    "based on this effective theory , one can study the perturbative theory which is equivalent to the perturbation directly starting from the original cf hamiltonian . in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , the renormalized effective mass of quasiparticle shows a logarithmic divergent behavior in consistence with hlr s result .",
    "this complex of the effective mass is very similar to the vortex effective mass in heii superfluid @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that the high frequency gauge fluctuations in the rpa calculation , in fact , do not renormalize the hfa result , i. e. , the rpa correction to the self - energy comes from the low - frequency part of the gauge fluctuations .    except the difficult status of the cf",
    "effective mass , another kind of problem of the fermionic chern - simons theory is explored by stern , simon and halperin recently @xcite . in hlr s theory , one replaces the electron band mass by a phenomenological effective mass , which causes , on the one hand , kohn s theorem is violated and the incorrect energy scale of the response functions in the small band mass limit ( equivalently , the high magnetic field limit ) , on the other hand .",
    "the former problem is solved by introducing a fermi liquid parameter in hlr s theory while the latter one is claimed beyond the theory for which stern , simon and halperin @xcite has to introduce an orbital magnetization attaching to the cf by hand .",
    "in fact , this magnetization could be induced from the interaction among the magnetoplasmons @xcite , which is beyond to the rpa . in the meanwhile",
    ", the interaction among the magnetoplasmons can not be renormalized , which relates to the magnetoplasmon dispersion obeys kohn s theorem .",
    "those results could be shown perturbatively in the temporal gauge which will be another contribution of the present paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we emphasize the physical picture of the cf and estimate its effective mass in a semi - classical way .",
    "in section iii , we review the fermionic chern - simons theory and work in the temporal gauge .",
    "the mean - field theory and the perturbative theory are formulated . in section iv ,",
    "the hfa and rpa calculations of the self - energy of cf are provided . in section",
    "v , we define the effective masses of the cf according to the hfa and rpa self - energies respectively .",
    "one shows that the finiteness or divergence of the effective mass in the different situation . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the response functions and their small band mass limit .",
    "the last section devotes our conclusions .",
    "the notion of the cf was first introduced by jain in order to give the prominent fqh states observed in experiment @xcite . however , in jain s picture , the density variation in the immediate vicinity of the flux tube attached to an electron was not considered .",
    "the fermionic chern - simons theory is based on this picture @xcite .",
    "recently , read @xcite gave an improved cf picture which considers the local environment change when a flux tube at the position of the extra electron is adiabatically turned on . according to laughlin s quasiparticle notion ,",
    "a quasihole can be obtained by acting the creation operator @xmath4 to the ground state wave functions . here",
    "@xmath5 is the complex variable in a two dimensional plane . in the immediate vicinity of @xmath6 , there is a charge depletion because the zeroes of the wave function .",
    "thus , the neutralizing uniform positive background is naked in the vicinity of the local position while an equal magnitude but opposite sign charge accumulates at the boundary .",
    "we call this local environment change as a vortex at @xmath6 .",
    "as well known , the vortex carrys a fractional charge @xmath7 and has the fractional statistics @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , the operator @xmath9 creates a @xmath10-fold vortex at @xmath6 . now adding an extra electron near @xmath6 , the @xmath10-fold vortex and the electron",
    "attract each other .",
    "since all electrons lie on the lll and then their kinetic energies are quenched , the electron and the vortex could form a bound state .",
    "this bound state , in laughlin s case , is a boson with zero charge if @xmath11 because @xmath10 is odd then the vortex is a fermion .",
    "read has noticed that for the case of even @xmath10 , this vortex picture has still a good chance to work .",
    "the trial wave function including a jastrow - like factor @xcite , say for @xmath12 , is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the magnetic length .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 has elements that are essentially plane waves , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 projects all electrons to the lll . in this case , the bound state is a fermion with its net charge zero . at low energies , we can consider such fermions as quasiparticles of the system which can not condense to zero wave vector due to pauli s principle .",
    "so , a quasiparticle generally has its wave vector @xmath18 . in the lll",
    ", this wave vector gives the separation of the electron from the vortex center .",
    "to see this point , as read noticed @xcite , we consider the operator @xmath19 which creates a fermion .",
    "the quasiparticle with the wave vector @xmath18 is created by acting on the ground state with @xmath20 in the lll , the operator @xmath21 acts on a state in the hilbert space likes @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "so the exponential @xmath23 is like a translation operator , i.e. , if @xmath24 is the prefactor of a wavefunction , then we have @xmath25 the @xmath26-th particle is displaced by @xmath27 .",
    "a quasiparticle with @xmath28 would have the electron exactly on the center of the vortex .",
    "so a quasiparticle with @xmath29 has the electron displaced by @xmath30 from the vortex center .",
    "this separation means that the electron and the vortex experience a potential @xmath31 which is caused by the static electric field of the other electrons . with the external magnetic field",
    ", the neutral fermion drifts along an equipotential line of @xmath31 with a velocity @xmath32 . near the bottom of the potential",
    ", it will be quadratic , and the quasiparticle has its effective mass @xmath33 in the kinetic energy sense .    after the previous physical intuitive description",
    ", we could estimate the effective mass of the cf semiclassically .",
    "assume a vortex carrying two flux quanta centers in the origin and attaches to an electron located at @xmath34 .",
    "( we restrict our discussion to @xmath35 . ) the coulomb potential that the electron feels reads @xmath36 where @xmath0 is the electron number of the system and @xmath37 is the electron density which tends to @xmath38 , the average density of the system , for sufficient large @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 stands for the size of the vortex .",
    "hence , there is an attraction between the electron and the vortex with the binding energy @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the space range of the vortex .",
    "because the electron kinetic energy is completely quenched in the lll , this energy binds the vortex and the electron that form a bound state which we call the cf . in the many - cf system , we deal with the second term on the left - hand side of the equality in ( [ be ] ) as the interaction between the cf and the neutralizing background and the first term as the potential the cf experienced . by using the legendre polynomials , one can expand the potential as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radius of the system which is a macroscopic quantity . using the approximation employed by laughlin in discussing the charge of the quasiparticle @xcite",
    ", one assumes there is no electron charge density in the regime of the vortex located ( i. e. , @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 out of this regime .",
    "then the unit charge of the vortex means that @xmath48 .",
    "the effective mass is estimated by @xmath49 plugging ( [ appv ] ) into the definition of the effective mass , one has @xmath50 which is very close to the value of @xmath51 obtained through the canonical transformation @xcite . also , it is well - fitted with the numerical result @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "the physical implication why those results of the effective mass calculation are so close is all those approaches to evaluate the effective mass are essentially based on the analysis to the ground state properties .    to end this section ,",
    "we argue why the fermionic chern - simons theory is possible to describe the neutral object .",
    "first , let us see the behavior of the quasiparticle when an applied electric field is turned on . if we apply an external electric field to the system , the charges accumulated on the boundary with a lower electric potential move into the sample and the charges on the higher potential boundary move out the sample .",
    "this causes an electric current through the sample . in the bulk , unlike an ordinary neutral object which can not feel the electric field , the neutral fermions do response to the electric field . for a neutral fermion with a wave vector @xmath18 ,",
    "the separation of its electron from the vortex center varies to @xmath53 .",
    "this implies the potential varies to @xmath54 and so does the drift velocity .",
    "therefore , the fermions have a neutral particle current in the electric field direction .",
    "because of the one - to - one correspondence between the neutral fermion and one electron charge accumulated on the boundary , the neutral current strength of the fermions is equal to the electric current strength through the sample . therefore , one can think the cf has one electron charge while there are no charge accumulation on the boundary and no net magnetic field acting on the cfs .",
    "in fact , the latter has been reflected in the factor @xmath55 multiplied to the composite fermion operator ( [ cf ] ) .",
    "if the external magnetic field slightly changes , the neutral quasiparticles also response to the change in the following sense .",
    "if the filling factor is slightly away @xmath56 , say @xmath57 for a large @xmath58 , the cfs carry a net charge @xmath59 . in the magnetic field @xmath60 , the cf feels lorentz force @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "again , the cf could be thought carrying one electron charge .",
    "the cfs with charge @xmath63 feel the residual magnetic field @xmath64 , which is what we will adopt .",
    "the ground state is a fermi sea filled by the vortex - like composite fermions if @xmath65 .",
    "in this section , we take a field theoretical way to understand the cf and physics at @xmath35 . because it is very tough to direct construct a field theory at the lll , we will use the full electron field first .",
    "the lll projection will be reflected in a truncation of momentum space .",
    "we start with a two dimensional interacting electron system which is placed in a uniform magnetic field @xmath60 perpendicular to the two dimensional plane in which there is a uniform positive background .",
    "one assumes that all electrons are polarized so that the spin degrees of freedom can be ignored .",
    "for the two - body interaction potential @xmath66 , the @xmath0-electron hamiltonian reads , @xmath67 ^ 2+\\sum_{i < j } v(\\vec{x}_i-\\vec{x}_j),\\ ] ] where the vector potential @xmath68 is corresponding to the magnetic field @xmath60 and @xmath2 is the band mass of the electrons .",
    "hereafter , we will use the unit @xmath69 .",
    "here we do not confine the electrons in the lll .",
    "the attraction between the electrons and the uniform background is not explicitly shown up .",
    "following a common way , we make an anyon transformation @xcite . writing the electron wavefunction @xmath70 with @xmath71 , the position of the @xmath26-th electron , the transformation to the wavefunction reads @xmath72^{\\tilde\\phi}\\phi(z_1, ... ,z_n),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an even number and then @xmath73 is the wavefunction of the chern - simons fermion . here",
    "we distinguish the terminology _ chern - simons fermion _ to the cf for the reason explained later .",

    ", it could be reached in the mean field theory , @xmath78 where we work in the symmetric gauge , i. e. , @xmath79 . around the mean field state",
    ", there is an important gauge fluctuation @xmath80 .",
    "hereafter , we denote @xmath75 as the fluctuation of the statistic field around the mean field . in this case , if we introduce the chern - simons fermion field @xmath81 in the second quantization theory , then the corresponding lagrangian reads , @xmath82-h.\\ ] ] here the hamiltonian has been taken in the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "note that here we wrote down the lagrangian in the coulomb gauge @xmath85 .",
    "it is well - known that the theory has a gauge invariance corresponding to the gauge transformation of @xmath75 .",
    "hence , the lagrangian can also be written in a gauge invariant form if we consider the bulk states only @xcite .",
    "then , one can choose other gauge to deal with the system .",
    "for our case , an appreciate choice is so - called temporal gauge , i.e. , @xmath86 recall the transverse component of the chern - simons gauge field canonically conjugates to the longitudinal component , one has @xmath87=\\epsilon_{ij}.\\ ] ] the hamiltonian in temporal gauge reads @xmath88 where we have specified the interaction to be the coulomb interaction .",
    "the suffix ` cf ' implies that we will consider the fermion field @xmath89 in temporal gauge as the cf field .",
    "the gauge transformation between @xmath81 and @xmath89 has been explicitly shown in ref.@xcite , which is just a normal one from the coulomb gauge to the temporal gauge ( see below ) .",
    "the lagrangian in the temporal gauge reads @xmath90-h_{cf}.\\ ] ]      we are going to deal with the variational ground state based on this mean - field consideration and the perturbative theory around the ground state .",
    "one can rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ cfh ] ) as @xmath91 where @xmath92 here @xmath93 and @xmath94 stand for the free hamiltonian of the cf and the gauge fluctuation respectively .",
    "@xmath95 is the interaction between the cf and the gauge field while @xmath96 is the self - interaction of the gauge field .",
    "the decomposition ( [ hdc ] ) of the hamiltonian is first given by shankar and murthy @xcite who point out that @xmath94 , in fact , describes the magnetoplasmons of the theory and hence , the mean - field state wave function is given by the unprojection version of ( [ gsw ] ) .",
    "the recovering of the modular part of @xmath97 in this wave function is closely related to the gauge transformation @xmath81 to @xmath89 . as shown by shankar and murthy @xcite , the cf field @xmath98 , indeed ,",
    "creates a chern - simons fermion @xmath99 and an associated hole .",
    "this agrees with read s vortex cf picture as we discussed in sec .",
    "ii . the mean - field state energy , then , reads , @xmath100 where @xmath101 will be regarded as the effective mass of the cf as we will see in the coming sections . indeed , by using a canonical transformation that eliminates @xmath95 to the lowest order , shankar and murthy found that the original kinetic energy is quenched if one chooses a truncation of the wave vector of the magnetoplasmon , @xmath102 , while @xmath103 serves as the effective mass . however , as we will see in the next section , the lowest order elimination yields a simple hfa to the cf self - energy .",

    "now we are going to discuss the effective mass of the cf . the rpa result to the cf self - energy shows that we can decomposite the gauge fluctuation into the high and low frequency parts .",
    "if the low - frequency gauge fluctuations are somehow suppressed , the high - frequency parts do not affect the hfa result because the bare gauge propagator is not renormalized by the high - frequency gauge fluctuations .",
    "so , we deal with the problem in two steps by switching off the low - frequency gauge fluctuations first and then turning it on .",
    "if the low - frequency gauge fluctuations is switched off , the self - energy is given by the hfa calculation ( [ hfa ] ) .",
    "the effective dispersion of the cf is defined by @xmath146 since the hfa self - energy is frequency - independent , the effective mass can be read off @xmath147 this is just the result obtained in ref.@xcite by the canonical transformation method . notice that this effective mass of the cf is not only well - defined at the fermi surface but also to any value of the momentum .",
    "furthermore , the high - frequency gauge fluctuations do not affect the gauge propagator .",

    "so , in general , @xmath162 with @xmath163 in the range @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "this result qualitatively agrees with the various experiments @xcite . in this sense , this effective mass defined in the hfa could be thought as a ` bare ' effective mass .    according to jain @xcite , all @xmath58 landau levels of the cfs",
    "are fully filled if @xmath165 the electron filling fraction , then , is given by @xmath166 which manifests that the iqhe of the cfs yields the fqhe of the electrons .",
    "furthermore , the landau gap of fqhe is given by @xmath167 one sees that the landau gap of fqhe is totally determined by the interaction as one expects .    to summarize this subsection",
    ", we see that the effective mass @xmath3 can be thought as the ` bare ' mass of cf in the effective theory and it essentially is the result of the mass renormalization in the hfa .",
    "physically , the hfa describes the probe cf interacting with the @xmath0-cf background without considering the vacuum fluctuation .",
    "this implies that the hfa basically reflects the ground state behavior of the cf system .",
    "so , it is no wonder why the ` bare ' effective mass calculated here is so close to the semi - classical estimation value of the effective mass ( see section ii ) and its numerical calculation value based on the ground state energy analysis @xcite .      in the last subsection , we have switched off the low - frequency gauge fluctuations and see the ` bare ' effective mass is finite . in the case of the fqhe with the odd denorminator filling fraction , it is a good approximation to neglect the low frequency gauge fluctuations because we have a finite landau gap . however , as @xmath154 approaches to @xmath168 , i. e. , all landau levels of the cfs are fully filled ( @xmath169 ) , the landau gap tends to vanish .",
    "the low - frequency gauge fluctuation may play an important rule in the theory . the perturbative theory associated with the effective hamiltonian ( [ eh ] )",
    "could begin with the following feynman s rules .",
    "the effective cf propagator reads @xmath170 where @xmath171 .",
    "others keep the same as those in section iii .",
    "especially , one would like to emphasize that the band mass in the interaction vertices are not renormalized .",
    "a similar calculation of the cf self - energy in the rpa gives rise to @xmath172 which is essentially the same as the original rpa result except the omitted terms are only weakly @xmath173-dependent .",
    "the effective mass @xmath174 , in the present case , is defined by @xmath175 that is , the effective mass in the rpa is logarithmic divergent at the fermi surface @xmath176 this is completely consistent with the effective mass obtained by using the perturbative theory developed in section iii .",
    "eq.([rpa ] ) gives the effective mass in the rpa through @xmath177 which also shows the divergence of the effective mass exactly like ( [ dvi ] ) .",
    "comparing to the effective mass calculation in the coulomb gauge , one sees that the cf effective mass in the rpa has the identical divergent form .",
    "consequently , we have seen that whether the effective mass diverges is dependent on how strongly the low - frequency gauge fluctuations can affect the propagation of the cf .",
    "the gauge fluctuation here in fact reflects the tranverse current fluctuations of the system .",
    "this implies that if the cf propagation in a physical process does not response the long - time transverse current fluctuation , the finiteness of the effective mass is shown and otherwise it tends to divergence .",
    "in the previous discussions , we omit the contribution from the self - interaction among the gauge fluctuations because its high energy behavior . however , in the small band mass limit , this interaction @xmath96 has a dominating contribution to the response functions since the coupling constant @xmath178 is not renormalized . in a recent paper ,",
    "stern , simon and halperin recognize another difficulty of the fermionic chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "namely , the energy scale of the response functions to the external field is not proper in the small band mass limit or equivalently the high magnetic field limit .",
    "they claimed that to solve this problem has beyond the fermionic chern - simons theory .",
    "then , a magnetization has to be attached to the cf by hand .",
    "after this phenomenological attachment , the current is separated into a magnetization current associated with the cyclotron motion of the electrons and a transport current associated with the guiding center motion .",
    "the cyclotron motion of the electron is not renormalizable so that the magnetization current dominates in the small band mass limit , which gives the correct energy scale of the response functions in the small band mass limit . here",
    ", we will see that this magnetization of cfs does not need to be attached by hand and is self - included in the theory .",
    "@xmath96 supplies this magnetization while the rest in the hamiltonian ( [ hdc ] ) describes the transport behavior of the theory .",
    "the current in the present theory is given by @xmath179 where @xmath180 are the full response functions .",
    "in the fermionic chern - simons theory , one replaces @xmath180 by the rpa response functions @xmath181 in fact , this approximation gives the transport current @xmath182 since the gauge propagator is not renormalized in @xmath183 .",
    "we see that the rpa result satisfys konh s theorem .",
    "namely , the pole of @xmath184 is at @xmath185 notice that the effective mass we obtained in the last section is related to the kinetic energy of the quasiparticle only so that in a further correction beyond the rpa , only @xmath186 is renormalized to @xmath187 but the leading term is not .",
    "this shows non - renormalizable of the cyclotron frequency and the satisfaction of konh s theorem .",
    "what we omitted in the proceeding treatment is the contribution from the self - interaction among the magnetoplasmons , @xmath96 . in the lowest order ,",
    "this interaction hamiltonian devotes a bubble of the gauge fluctuation like fig .",
    "6 to the response functions .",
    "this lowest order approximation yields rewriting @xmath96 as @xcite @xmath188 4\\pi \\rho(\\vec{x}).\\ ] ] this contributes to the total current a cyclotron part @xmath189 where @xmath190 is bohr s magnet .",
    "this is just the magnetization current introduced in the stern , simon and halperin s paper @xcite .",
    "now , we are going to the response function in the small band mass limit .",
    "first , we recall the current conservation , @xmath191 in addition , the gauge transformation from the coulomb gauge to the temporal gauge is given by @xmath192 this gives @xmath193 then , we can have the following relations between the response functions : @xmath194    using equations ( [ cont ] ) , ( [ cotmp ] ) and ( [ relation ] ) , one sees that the magnetization current contributes to the response functions like @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "this gives the correct energy scale of the response functions in the small band mass limit @xcite , @xmath197    in conclusion , we recover the correct small band mass limit of the response functions due to considering the self - interaction among the magnetoplasmons which has been neglected in the previous literatures relating to the perturbative theory of the fermionic chern - simons theory in the clue of hlr .",
    "it appears because the magnetic current actually is devoted by feynman s diagram ( fig .",
    "6 ) beyond the rpa as we have seen .",
    "to summarize this work , we have seen that the physical picture of the cf based on the bound state of the electron and the attached vortex can be realized in a field theoretical way , the fermionic chern - simons theory , especially if the temporal gauge is taken into account .",
    "one found that there are two cf effective masses which related to the different physical processes .",
    "the finite effective @xmath3 is applied to the processes where the low - frequency gauge fluctuations become not important while the divergent one is associated with the low - frequency gauge field fluctuations dominate .",
    "furthermore , one found that the finite effective mass works for arbitrary cf momentum but the divergent one could only well - defined near the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , we define an effective theory by using the finite effective mass as the ` bare ' mass while keeping the interaction terms do not change .",
    "the rpa calculations either by directly perturbative theory or by the effective theory showed the same logarithmic divergence of the renormalized effective mass .",
    "the other advantage of using the temporal gauge to the fermionic chern - simons field theory is that one can somewhat go beyond the rpa of the perturbative theory .",
    "an example is the calculation of the total current .",
    "the rpa could only give its transport part while the magnetization part comes from the self - interaction among the magnetoplasmons which has been ignored in the perturbative theory in the coulomb gauge .",
    "so , we solved the problem about the incorrect energy scale of the response functions in the small band mass limit .",
    "so far we have partially cleared two puzzles in the fermionic chern - simons theory : the effective mass and the response functions in the small band mass limit .",
    "it would be interesting to relate our theory in the temporal gauge to various results in the coulomb gauge .",
    "we will leave those relationships to the further work . also the disorder problem is not involved in this paper .",
    "the authors are gradeful ping ao to remind us the similar situation of the effective mass in @xmath198 superfluid .",
    "they also thank v. j. goldmann to point out a citation error in the references .",
    "this work wass supported in part by the nsf of china .",
    "one of us ( y. y. ) was also supported by grant lwtz-1298 of chinese academy of science .",
