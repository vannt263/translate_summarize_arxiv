    "with an ever - increasing number of secure detections , supermassive black holes ( bhs ) have evolved , in a ten - year span , from exotic curiosities to fundamental components of galaxies .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive bhs are tightly intertwined , from the early phases of proto - galactic formation ( silk & rees 1998 ; sellwood & moore 1999 ) , through hierarchical build - up in cdm - like cosmogonies ( efstathiou & rees 1988 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ) , to recent galaxy mergers ( merritt 2000 ) .",
    "studying the demographics of the local bh population might have a significant impact on models of galaxy evolution ( e.g. salucci et al . 1999 ; cattaneo , haehnelt & rees 1999 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) presented the first , and to date only , demographic study of nuclear bhs .",
    "ground based kinematic data for 32 galaxies were combined with hst photometry to constrain dynamical models ",
    "based on the jeans equation  under the assumptions of axisymmetry , velocity isotropy in the meridional plane and a spatially - constant mass - to - light ratio for the stars .",
    "the mass of a putative nuclear bh was introduced as a free parameter , in addition to the stellar mass - to - light ratio and the galaxy inclination angle . in most of the galaxies ,",
    "the addition of a central point mass improved the fit to the observed kinematics .",
    "magorrian et al . concluded that most , or all , galaxies contain central bhs with an average ratio of bh mass to spheroid mass of @xmath8 .",
    "the magorrian et al .",
    "study remains unique for targeting a large sample of galaxies , and for its coherent and homogeneous treatment of the data .",
    "however , while the magorrian et al .",
    "estimates of the bulge mass - to - light ratios are likely to be robust , a number of authors have noted that the inferred bh masses might be systematically too large .",
    "van der marel ( 1997 ) showed that the bh masses derived from well - resolved central kinematical data are a factor 5 smaller than produced by the magorrian et al .",
    "analysis ; he suggested that the neglect of velocity anisotropy might have led to overestimates of the bh masses .",
    "wandel ( 1999 ) compared bh masses derived from reverberation mapping studies of active galaxies with the magorrian et al .",
    "estimates and found a discrepancy of a factor of @xmath9 in the bh - to - bulge mass ratio at a fixed luminosity .",
    "he noted the difficulty of resolving low - mass bhs in distant galaxies and suggested a distance - dependent bias in the estimates .    an independent argument along the same lines was presented by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ; fm00 ; paper i ) . using the tight empirical correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath10 , the velocity dispersion of the stellar bulge , for the 12 galaxies with the best - determined bh masses , fm00 showed that the magorrian et al .",
    "masses fall systematically above the @xmath11 relation , some by as much as two orders of magnitude .    at the present time",
    ", the @xmath11 relation is probably our best guide to bh demographics .",
    "ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) found that the relation has a scatter no larger than that expected on the basis of measurement errors alone .",
    "the relation is apparently so tight that it surpasses in predictive accuracy what can be achieved from detailed dynamical modeling of stellar kinematical data in most galaxies . by combining the bulge stellar masses derived by magorrian et al . with bh masses inferred from the @xmath11 relation ,",
    "we are in a position to compute the most robust estimate to date of the bh mass distribution in nearby galaxies .",
    "table 1 gives the relevant physical parameters for the 32 galaxies in the magorrian et al .",
    "all galaxies , with the exception of m31 , are early type . in",
    "what follows , we refer to the hot stellar component in these galaxies as the `` bulge ; '' this is in fact the case for m31 , although for the other objects the `` bulge '' is the entire galaxy .",
    "distances were re - derived as in paper i ; values for the bulge @xmath12-band luminosity ( @xmath13 ) , bulge mass ( @xmath14 ) and bh mass ( @xmath15 ) are the same as in magorrian et al . except for the ( mostly small ) corrections resulting from the new distances .",
    "central velocity dispersions @xmath16 were taken from the literature and corrected to a common aperture size of @xmath17 of the effective radius , as in paper i. we then computed bh masses , @xmath1 , using the @xmath18 relation in the form given by merritt & ferrarese ( 2000 ; paper ii ) : @xmath19 this expression was derived by fitting to the combined galaxy samples of ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) ( 12 galaxies ) and gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000a ) ( 15 additional galaxies ) , plus 7 active galaxies for which both @xmath16 and @xmath1 are available , the latter from reverberation mapping ( gebhardt et al .",
    "some debate exists over the exact value of the slope in equation ( 1 ) ( paper i , ii ; gebhardt et al .",
    "we explore below how changing the assumed slope affects our conclusions .",
    "the correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath13 , and between @xmath1 and @xmath14 , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "there is a rough proportionality of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath1 , though the vertical scatter in both relations is much larger than in the @xmath11 relation ( paper i ) .",
    "we defined the two mass ratios : @xmath20 based respectively on the bh mass estimates from magorrian et al . and from the @xmath11 relation .",
    "values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given in table 1 .",
    "bh masses derived from the @xmath11 relation yield the mean values @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ". these are substantially smaller than the mean values computed from the magorrian et al .",

    "we note that one galaxy , ngc 4486b , has @xmath27 , making it an extreme outlier in the magorrian et al .",
    "distribution . removing this single galaxy from the sample",
    "gives @xmath28 while leaving @xmath29 essentially unchanged .",
    "figure 2 reveals a clear trend of @xmath30 with the apparent radius of influence of the central black hole , assuming the masses predicted by the @xmath11 relation are correct .",
    "a natural interpretation is that there is a resolution - dependent bias in the magorrian et al .",
    "modeling ( e.g. van der marel 1997 ; wandel 1999 ) : the radius of influence of all of the magorrian et al .",
    "galaxies is smaller than @xmath31 arcsec , too small to have been clearly resolved from the ground .",
    "we seek an estimate of the frequency function @xmath32 . following merritt ( 1997 )",
    ", we define this estimate as @xmath33 , the function that maximizes the penalized log likelihood @xmath34 of the data @xmath35 , subject to the constraints @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the `` observable '' function , i.e. the convolution of the true @xmath38 with the error distribution of @xmath39 .",
    "this error distribution is not well known ; we assume that it is a gaussian with some dispersion @xmath40 .",
    "failing to account for measurement errors in @xmath39 would lead to a spuriously broad @xmath33 .",
    "the natural penalty function to use is silverman s ( 1982 ) : @xmath41 ^ 2 dy.\\ ] ] this function assigns zero penalty to any @xmath42 that is gaussian . in the limit of large @xmath43 , the estimate @xmath44 is driven toward the gaussian function that is most consistent , in a maximum - likelihood sense , with the data ; smaller values of @xmath43 return nonparametric estimates of @xmath42 .",
    "we made no attempt to calculate the `` optimal '' value of the smoothing parameter given the small size of the data set .",
    "the results of the optimization are shown in figure 3 , assuming @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath33 is nicely symmetric and reasonably well described as a gaussian , although with a narrower - than - gaussian central peak .",
    "the best - fit gaussian has its mean at @xmath46 and a standard deviation of @xmath47 .",
    "by contrast , the magorrian et al . masses define a more flat - topped distribution with one extreme outlier , ngc 4486b , at @xmath48 .",
    "the gaussian fit to the magorrian et al .",
    "mass distribution has its mode at @xmath49 and a standard deviation of @xmath50 .",
    "the two galaxies with the largest bh mass ratios , ngc 4486b and ngc 4660 , are both low - mass ellipticals .",
    "the smallest mass ratio , @xmath51 , is seen in a very massive galaxy , ngc 4874 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to check whether low- and high - mass galaxies have different characteristic distributions of @xmath22 .",
    "this hypothesis is tested in figure 4a , which shows @xmath33 computed separately for the 16 galaxies from table 1 with the lowest and highest values of @xmath0 .",
    "there is in fact a slight difference between the two distributions : the high - mass galaxies have @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while the low - mass galaxies have @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "however the offset in @xmath56 is similar to the width of either distribution and may not be significant .",
    "we note that the massive galaxies define a narrower distribution",
    ".    our conclusions about @xmath42 might be substantially dependent on the assumed form of the @xmath11 relation , equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the slope of that relation is fairly uncertain , @xmath57 ; however the normalization at @xmath58 appears to be more robust ( paper ii ) .",
    "we therefore set @xmath59 and investigated the effects of varying @xmath60 .",
    "figure 4b shows that a larger slope implies a broader @xmath42 due to the stronger implied dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath16 .",
    "however the mean value of @xmath22 is almost unchanged .",
    "our estimate of the mean bh - to - bulge mass ratio , @xmath61 , falls squarely between the estimates of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( @xmath62 ) , based on dynamical modeling of the same sample of galaxies used here ; and of wandel ( 1999 ) ( @xmath63 ) , based on bh masses computed from reverberation mapping in a sample of 18 active galaxies .",
    "bulge masses in the wandel ( 1999 ) study were computed directly from bulge luminosities assuming a simple scaling law for the mass - to - light ratio , and not from dynamical modeling .",
    "there is reason to believe that these luminosities are systematically too large and therefore that the derived mass ratios @xmath64 are too low .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000b ) and merritt & ferrarese ( 2000 ) found that the reverberation mapping bh masses in 7 galaxies were consistent with the @xmath11 relation even though they fall systematically below the @xmath65 relation .",
    "a reasonable conclusion is that the true or derived luminosities of these active galaxies are systematically higher than those of normal galaxies with comparable velocity dispersions .",
    "a mean offset of a factor @xmath66 in the bulge luminosities would suffice to bring the average mass ratio for active galaxies in line with the value inferred here .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000b ) discuss a number of possible reasons why an error of this sort is likely in the agn bulge luminosities .",
    "the discrepancy with the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) masses is perhaps unsurprising given past indications that these masses are systematically too large ( van der marel 1997 ; ho 1999 ) .",
    "the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath67 corresponds to a factor @xmath5 average error in the magorrian et al .",
    "bh masses .",
    "one possible explanation is the neglect of anisotropy in the modeling ( van der marel 1997 ) , but we emphasize that the errors in @xmath15 implied by figure 2 are enormous , of order @xmath68 , in many of the galaxies . if the bh masses predicted by the @xmath11 relation are correct , the kinematical data for these galaxies would not have contained any useful information about the mass of the bh ( figure 2 ) . any features in these data that were reproduced by adjusting @xmath15",
    "must have had their origin in some systematic difference between the models and real galaxies , and not in the gravitational attraction of the bh .",
    "this conclusion , if correct , underscores the dangers of an `` assembly - line '' approach to galaxy modeling .",
    "we may crudely estimate the total mass density of bhs in the local universe by combining our result , @xmath69 , with the mean mass density of spheroids , @xmath70 mpc@xmath71 ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1997 , for @xmath72 mpc@xmath73 ) . this simple argument ( first invoked by haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 )",
    "gives @xmath74 mpc@xmath71 .",
    "salucci et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented a more sophisticated treatment based on convolution of the spheroid luminosity function with @xmath75 .",
    "they assumed a gaussian distribution with @xmath76 and found @xmath77 mpc@xmath71 .",
    "correcting their value of @xmath56 to our value of @xmath78 implies a factor @xmath79 decrease in @xmath80 , consistent with the result of our simpler calculation .",
    "the total mass density of bh at large redshifts can be estimated using an argument first suggested by soltan ( 1982 ) .",
    "requiring the optical qso luminosity function to be reproduced purely by accretion onto nuclear bhs , and assuming an accretion efficiency of 10% , leads to @xmath81 mpc@xmath71 ( chokshi & turner 1992 ; salucci et al .",
    "while independent of the cosmological model , this result is subject to uncertainties in the bolometric corrections applied to the qso magnitudes ( e.g. salucci et al . 1999 ) , furthermore , concerns have been raised about the completeness of the qso luminosity function ( e.g. goldschmidt & miller 1998 ; graham , clowes & campusano 1999 ) .",
    "a similar argument , based on the hard x - ray background , gives @xmath82 mpc@xmath71 at @xmath83 ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; salucci et al .",
    "1999 ; barger et al .",
    "these numbers are consistent with our estimate of @xmath80 .    by contrast",
    ", @xmath84 differs from the local bh mass density implied by the magorrian et al .",
    "relation by over an order of magnitude , assuming a canonical 10% accretion efficiency onto the central black hole in high redshift agns .",
    "haehnelt , natarajan & rees ( 1998 ) and barger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) point out that if the remnants of the qsos are to be identified with the bhs in present - day galaxies , the magorrian et al .",
    "mass distribution requires either that a large fraction of bhs reside within high redshift sources that are too obscured ( both in the optical and the x - rays ) to be observed , or else that a significant amount of accretion ( with low radiative efficiency ) proceeds to the present epoch .",
    "the need for these alternative explanations is largely removed when the more robust estimate of @xmath80 presented in this paper is adopted .",
