    "two disk tips are pitched to the screw axes , whereas the tips in the conventional kd are parallel to the screw axes .",

    ", we consider different directions and sizes of the tip angle on a neutrally staggered kd , and discuss their mixing characteristics using numerical simulation of the polymer - melt flow in the kneading zone .",

    "that is , irrespective of bt angle , the inhomogeneity of the dispersive mixing is at the same level as that of the nt type with an increase of @xmath26 , the fluctuation of @xmath35 for bt slightly increases , suggesting that inhomogeneity in the dispersive mixing is smaller for lower @xmath26 . in short , for bt type , both high level and small inhomogeneity of @xmath35 is achieved at low @xmath26 conditions , indicating that that dispersive mixing in bt type is most effective when @xmath26 is low and the bt angle is large .             in order to further study the effects of the tip - angle on dispersive mixing",

    "irrespective of the tip angle , the highest shear stress is achieved in the small gap regions like the tip  barrel clearance and the inter - meshing region .",
    "the substantial dispersion process mainly takes place when fluid elements pass through such high - stress regions .",
    "however , since the high - stress region occupies only a small fraction of the whole channel , the fraction of the fluid passing through these regions and the number of passages are essentially determined by the flow pattern at the low - stress ( low - shear - rate ) regions .",
    "thus , the geometric structures of the mixing elements are directly responsible for the passage of fluid through the high - stress regions , eventually leading to a better dispersive mixing performance .        by setting a threshold value for the magnitude of the shear stress tensor ,",
    "the regions of tip  barrel clearance and the screw inter - meshing region are defined as the high - stress regions .",
    "for instance , the region where the shear stress magnitude is larger than 0.35mpa for nt type under @xmath37cm@xmath21 is shown in fig",
    ".  [ figa ] , which clearly shows that the high - stress region is localized at around tip - clearance and inter - meshing regions .",
    "we calculated the fraction of the tracers passing through the high - stress regions as well as the residence time in those regions .",
    "for each tracer , the residence time in the high - stress regions , @xmath38 , as well as the residence time in the whole mixing zone , @xmath30 , has been studied . figures  [ fig8](a ) and ( b ) show the probability density function of the ratio @xmath39 under @xmath34cm@xmath21 . at a first look at figs .",
    "[ fig8](a ) and ( b ) , the residence time in the high - stress regions is at most 0.1 during the residence in whole zone , irrespective of the tip angle . both for ft and bt types ,",
    "the residence in the high - stress regions becomes longer compared to the nt type , indicating that the pitched - tip geometry can enhance the efficiency of conveying the fluid to the high - stress regions .",
    "the increase of the relative residence in the high - stress regions is more pronounced with the bt type .",
    "this observation partly explains the enhancement of the dispersive mixing by the pitched tip .         from figs .",
    "[ fig8](a ) and ( b ) , we also observe that the probability of vanishing @xmath38 takes a finite value , indicating that not all the fluid elements pass through the high - stress regions . in order to study this aspect",
    ", we discuss the fraction of the tracers passing the high - stress regions , denoted by @xmath40 . in figs .",
    "[ fig9](a ) and ( b ) , @xmath40 is plotted to the mean residence time of high - stress regions , @xmath41 , for different @xmath26 values , in which the larger symbol is for the larger value of @xmath26 . in the plot of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,",
    "the upper locations means that a large fraction of tracers pass through the high - stress regions , while the right locations means that the tracers stay long time in the high - stress regions .",
    "hence , the upper and right locations indicate a high potential for dispersive mixing .    for conventional nt type , a fraction , 0.40.5 , of the fluid passes through the high - stress region for the @xmath26 value studied .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are rather insensitive to the value of @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast , for ft and bt types , @xmath42 and @xmath43 show a relatively large dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "we observe a general trend such that , as @xmath26 decreases , both @xmath42 and @xmath43 increase .",
    "in addition , the characteristics of the passage through the high - stress region have different tip - angle dependencies with different directions of the tip angle . while for ft type , @xmath42 and @xmath43 does not depend on the tip angle , for bt type , @xmath42 and @xmath43 take larger values for larger backward tip angles .",
    "this fact is consistent with the tip - angle dependence of the mean applied stress during residence in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and [ fig7](a ) .",
    "the characteristics of the passage through the high - stress region reveal that the backward tip is effective at enhancing the dispersive mixing ability .         from the data",
    "above , it turns out that the pitched tip modifies the dispersive mixing ability of kneading disks , and the backward tip enhanced the potential of dispersive mixing while keeping the distributive mixing ability .",
    "we discuss the relation between the flow pattern induced by the geometry of the pitched - tip kd and the dispersive mixing ability .",
    "pitched tips add an additional drag ability along the screw rotation to conventional kd . for backward tips",
    "increase the drag in the backward extrusion direction , for @xmath44 condition , the pressure drop in bt type becomes larger than that in nt , leading to the pressure flow in the extrusion direction being more pronounced in bt .",
    "the enhanced pressure flow in bt promotes the passage of fluid across the small gap at the backward tips , resulting in an increase of the passage through the high - stress regions and the mean applied stress . in other words ,",
    "the geometry of backward tips cause a counteracting effect by blocking against the forward flow and the additional forward pressure flow while keeping the leakage flow in the inter - disk spaces .",
    "since this effect is driven by the screw rotation , it is maximized with the small @xmath26 condition , which is clearly demonstrated by the characteristics of the passage through the high - stress region in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] . in the case of ft type , since the forward pitched tips increase the drag in the forward direction , for @xmath44 conditions the pressure drop become smaller than for nt , or even becomes negative , depending on @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the counteracting effect of the pressure flow and the blockage by the tips is weaker in the ft type than in the bt type . in short ,",
    "the geometric modification of conventional kd by pitched tips induces both a change in the channel geometry and a modification of the pressure flow , causing a change in dispersive mixing ability .",
    "in pitched - tip kneading disks  ( ptkd ) , a novel melt - mixing element used in twin - screw extrusion , the effects of the direction and size of the tip angle on the mixing characteristics were investigated based on the numerical simulation of a three - dimensional flow . under a material feed rate and a screw rotation speed , the tip angle on a conventional kneading - disk  ( kd )",
    "element modifies the following two properties of the flow : ( i ) additional drag ability caused by screw rotation modifies the pressure flow , ( ii ) the pitched - tip acts as a blockage to the pressure flow induced by the pitched - tip .",
    "these counteracting effects result in an increase of the fraction of the fluid elements passing through the high - stress regions , leading to a modification of the dispersive mixing ability .",
    "forward tips on neutrally staggered kd increase the inhomogeneity of the applied stress during residence compared to the conventional kd , while keeping the residence time fluctuation .",
    "in contrast , backward tips on neutrally staggered kd increase the mean applied stress during residence , suggesting an enhancement of the dispersive mixing ability . these effects are more pronounced for larger tip angles , and are dependent on the ratio of the material feed rate to the screw rotation speed .",
    "these findings about the role of the tip angle can be useful for a better understanding of the mixing characteristics of a general class of ptkd elements and for choosing the optimal combination of the disk - stagger angle and tip angle .",
