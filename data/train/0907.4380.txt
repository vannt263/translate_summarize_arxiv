    "lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are currently among our best windows on the universe of galaxies at redshifts @xmath11 .",
    "lbgs are especially useful for investigating galaxy formation and evolution because they are relatively easy to find in large numbers ( approaching 2 arcmin@xmath12 down to @xmath13 ; steidel et al 2003 ; giavalisco et al 2002 ) and because they are relatively bright in the optical , thus permitting optical spectroscopic followup .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts of several thousand lbgs have been measured to date , with photometric redshifts of tens of thousands also available @xcite , and luminosity functions beyond @xmath14 have been measured @xcite . lbgs account for almost all of the star formation at @xmath15 observable in optical windows , and roughly half of the total star formation at those redshifts once dust - obscured systems such as sub - mm galaxies are included @xcite .",
    "although a complete picture of lbgs and their relation to galaxies today remains elusive , many pieces of the picture are now available .",
    "spectra of lbgs clearly show evidence of strong bursts of star formation , ranging from @xmath16 , confirmed with deep radio and x - ray imaging with the vla and _ chandra _ by @xcite , who estimate a mean star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath17 for uv - selected galaxies at @xmath18 .",
    "deep images with hst reveal small sizes @xmath19 kpc ( with @xmath20 ) , high luminosities @xmath21 , and diverse morphologies , including multiple small knots , diffuse halos , and asymmetrical linear features .",
    "images detect only @xmath22 of lbgs , implying that the agn fraction is at most that much @xcite .",
    "the spectra of lbgs also show evidence of strong outflows , e.g. ly@xmath23  emission lines red - shifted and interstellar absorption lines blueshifted with respect to systemic redshifts @xcite and a paucity of qso h  i  absorption lines near lbg sightlines @xcite , although @xcite find that only smaller outflow bubbles are needed to explain the spectra , i.e. 0.5 mpc comoving , implying that metals observed in the ly@xmath23forest are unlikely to come from lbgs .    measuring and understanding the dynamical state and masses of lbgs is important for placing them in the context of galaxy formation . a galaxy s mass affects its rate of accretion of new material , its ability to retain gas against the expulsive force of supernova winds , and possibly its eventual morphological type .",
    "the need to constrain lbg dynamics motivates the present work .    in the local universe , total galaxy mass is usually measured kinematically by deriving rotation curves or emission line widths for disk galaxies @xcite , measuring internal velocity dispersions for elliptical and other spheroidal systems , and measuring velocity distributions of satellite galaxies or other test particles for all galaxy types @xcite , and then translating the observed velocity field into a dynamical or virial mass .",
    "the masses of larger systems such as galaxy groups and clusters , but not of their constituent galaxies , are likewise constrained by direct measurement of their velocity dispersions , as well as by x - ray emission and gravitational lensing .",
    "three kinds of direct evidence to date have been used to study the dynamics of lbgs and lbg host halos : emission line widths and spatially - resolved kinematics ( for total mass and dynamical state ) , spectral energy distributions ( for stellar mass only ) , and clustering analysis .",
    "lbg mass measurements from redshifted h@xmath23  emission line widths and spatially - resolved kinematics generally fall in the range @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "some signs of rotation curves are seen at @xmath25 @xcite , and there is also evidence for superwinds , especially ly@xmath23  emission lines blue - shifted with respect to stellar and interstellar absorption lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that one - third of 62 galaxies at @xmath26 they studied with the sinfoni integral field unit ( ifu ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) showed rotation - dominated kinematics , one - third are interacting or merging systems , and one - third are dominated by random motions ; derived h@xmath23  dynamical masses for the whole sample are @xmath27 , with median @xmath28 .",
    "estimates of the stellar mass of lbgs have benefited from deep imaging with _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ s infrared array camera ( irac ) , including especially the goods and extended groth strip ( egs ) fields .",
    "stellar masses @xmath29 of lbgs at @xmath30 generally range from @xmath31 for luminosities @xmath32 , with typical median values @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "ly@xmath23  emitting galaxies ( lae s ) show similar stellar masses @xcite .",
    "samples of lbgs in the redshift range @xmath34 are now large enough to constrain star formation history in lbgs : the median lbg mass is reported to be lower by around a factor of 10 at @xmath35 than at @xmath15 @xcite , implying significant buildup of stellar mass through star formation and merging over that time , and mirroring the observed increase by roughly a factor of 10 in the comoving stellar mass density @xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath38 measured in the distant red galaxy ( drg ) population @xcite .",
    "finally , the observed clustering of lbgs has been used to constrain the mass of dark matter halos in which the galaxies presumably reside .",
    "two - point correlation analysis reveals that lbgs cluster with each other with typical correlation length @xmath39 mpc and implied halo masses @xmath40 @xcite , while still leaving the masses of individual lbgs within those halos uncertain .",
    "clustering of lbgs with damped ly@xmath23  qso absorption line clouds ( dlas ) has also been detected , with implied dla halo masses on the order of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "lbgs are also observed to cluster on small scales : @xcite and @xcite found that the two - point correlation function of faint objects in the hdf , consisting largely of lbgs at high redshift , peaks between 025 and 04 ( @xmath42 kpc at @xmath43 ) with amplitude greater than 2 , i.e. lbgs appear as multiple clumps of emission rather than monolithic sources .",
    "they interpret that multiplicity as evidence of starbursting regions within otherwise normal gas - rich galaxies .",
    "many of the targets discussed in the current paper fall into that category of close pairs or multiple - knot sources .",
    "galaxy formation theorists have used observations of lbgs extensively to check and revise their predictions and detailed descriptions of mass assembly , star formation , feedback , morphology , and clustering over cosmic time .",
    "hydrodynamic @xmath44-body simulations @xcite and semi - analytic models ( sams ; cole et al 2000 ; somerville et al 2001 ; bower et al 2006 ) of cold dark matter ( cdm ) structure and galaxy formation have generally succeeded in describing the observed photometric , stellar mass , size , star formation , luminosity function , and clustering properties of lbgs , especially by including varying amounts of dust extinction . in particular , the maximum stellar masses of lbgs predicted in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) models are @xmath45 at @xmath46 and @xmath47 at @xmath37 @xcite ; sizes are predicted to be @xmath48 kpc and halo and internal velocity dispersions to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ; star formation rates are expected to be @xmath51 @xcite ; and sfr is predicted to correlate only weakly with stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the available information therefore suggests that lbgs at @xmath52 range in stellar mass from @xmath53 with total mass from dynamical constraints @xmath54 , and that they reside in dark matter halos with mass @xmath55 , with significant clustering .",
    "their star formation rates range from @xmath56 , with gas content and therefore star formation duty cycles and gas depletion timescales poorly constrained .",
    "their comoving number density correponds roughly to that of luminous galaxies today , and their optical sizes and morphologies are diverse and compact .",
    "the general picture then is that lbgs are a heterogeneous set of actively star - forming galaxies or sub - galactic clumps , building blocks that will likely coalesce with other lbgs and/or non - lbg clumps to form more massive galaxies , groups , and clusters by @xmath38 .    to address further the open question of the dynamics of lyman break galaxies and their host halos and help place them with more detail in the larger context of galaxy formation and evolution ,",
    "we have obtained spatially resolved optical ( rest - uv ) spectra with the 10-m keck telescope of a sample of lbgs and searched for kinematic information that we can use to constrain individual lbg and lbg host halo dynamics directly .",
    "our sample is more than one magnitude fainter and is at higher redshift than the kinematic targets previously studied by others .",
    "nir ifu observations , especially with adaptive optics ( ao ) @xcite , now provide direct access at @xmath57 to h@xmath23  and other rest - optical emission lines not strongly affected by dust , in contrast to ly@xmath23 . however , optical spectroscopy such as that presented here has the advantage of lower sky and telescope background emission and higher sensitivity instruments and detectors , as well as broader redshift coverage .",
    "the observations are described in   [ sec : obs ] , evidence for kinematic information is presented in   [ sec : kin ] , and we discuss the results in the light of current models , theory , and other observations in   [ sec : disc ] . throughout the paper we adopt the currently favored cosmological parameters @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "our sample was drawn from 46 candidate and confirmed lbgs in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) .",
    "we used the same sample selection as @xcite : blue in `` @xmath60 '' ( @xmath61 ) but extremely red in `` @xmath62 '' ( @xmath63 ) , the colors expected for a blue , star - forming galaxy at @xmath64 with a lyman continuum break .",
    "this color criterion is similar to that adopted by @xcite , but is slightly less restrictive in the blue @xmath62 , red @xmath60 region , which @xcite found allowed detection of `` ly@xmath23-break galaxies '' at higher redshift in addition to pure lyman break galaxies .",
    "seven of the 46 sources were included via that relaxed criterion .",
    "the galaxy magnitudes fell in the range @xmath65 , with a median value of 25.34 .",
    "the sample is thus more than 1 magnitude fainter than that of @xcite and more than 2 magnitudes fainter than that of @xcite .",
    "we chose both targets with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts and those without , since the success rate for lbgs selected in this way is typically so high ( @xmath66 for bright sources , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the median reported redshift was @xmath67 .",
    "many of the galaxies discussed here were studied by @xcite and @xcite but with lower spectral resolution and/or less attention to the position angle of the spectrograph slit .",
    "we took full advantage of the fine pixel scale and high resolution of the hdf wfpc2 images , 0.04pixel@xmath68 with @xmath69 014 .",
    "we preferentially chose lbgs that showed clear signs of one or more of the following : ( 1 ) significant spatial extent @xmath70 in the hdf - n image ; ( 2 ) multiple knots and/or close pairings of lbgs in the hdf - n ; and ( 3 ) previous spectroscopic evidence for some kinematic features .",
    "we also prioritized bright targets over faint ones . in all we observed 32 kinematic lbg targets in the hdf - n .",
    "of the 32 total lbg targets observed , 21 showed some promise in the data of allowing dynamical mass estimates ; the remaining discussion will focus exclusively on those 21 objects plus one serendipitously discovered lbg , which together we call the `` high - priority targets '' .",
    "a complete list of all 22 targets is given in table  [ tab : targs ] , and the 11 unused targets are listed for completeness in table  [ tab : unusedtargs ] .",
    "most of those 11 were not useful for kinematic measurements because they had insufficient signal - to - noise ratio , no strong emission line , or no detectable spatial extent in our spectra .",
    "we compared our target list to the list of lbgs hosting agn in the hdf according to _ chandra _ x - ray flux as reported by @xcite ; no sources match within 10  down to 0.5 - 2 kev flux levels as low as @xmath71 , so we conclude that none of our targets hosts a luminous agn .",
    "our observations were made during six observing runs from may 1997 to april 1999 at the 10-meter keck - ii telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke 1995 ) .",
    "we designed six slit masks around the lbg targets ; high - priority targets were observed with multiple masks to increase integration time .",
    "each target was examined closely in the hdf image , and then its corresponding slit was tilted to match the long axis of any extended emission from the target galaxy .",
    "slits were also tilted to cover multiple targets in close pairs or groupings .",
    "the masks were designed so that the position angle ( pa ) of most slits was within @xmath72  of the pa of the mask , meaning the slits were aligned close to perpendicular to the dispersion direction .",
    "but some slits were tilted as much as @xmath73  from the mask pa and the normal to the dispersion direction .",
    "each mask had between 23 and 25 slits total ( not including holes for alignment stars ) .",
    "about half the slits on each mask were designed around targets in the hdf and flanking fields for other programs .",
    "slit lengths for our lbg targets ranged from 8 - 35 , with a typical length of 15 .",
    "all slits were 11  wide , although the slit tilts cause that width to be projected to a dimension smaller on the sky by a factor of cos(@xmath74 ) , where @xmath74 is the relative angle between the slit and the mask .",
    "the mask pas were optimized for the anticipated mean hour angle of the hdf at the time of observation , in the sense that we tried to keep the majority of slits aligned with the parallactic angle to minimize slit losses due to differential refraction .",
    "we relied on our own astrometric measurements of the hdf and flanking fields to derive target positions .    for deriving wavelength solutions ,",
    "hgnearkr arc lamps were observed through each mask .",
    "strong night sky lines were used to fine - tune the wavelength solution of some spectra .",
    "we used a 600 l / mm grating blazed at 5000   , resulting in a dispersion of 1.28     pixel@xmath68 , a typical resolution of 4 pixels @xmath75 5    full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) or 300 @xmath76 .",
    "this represented a compromise between a lower - resolution grating that might have delivered higher signal - to - noise per pixel and a higher - resolution grating that would have provided more detailed kinematic information .",
    "the grating angle was adjusted so that central wavelengths for slits at the mask centers were between 5000 and 6000 , giving a spectral coverage of 2620  and spectra ranging from a minimum of 3456  to a maximum of 6978 .",
    "the spatial pixel scale for slits perpendicular to the dispersion direction was 0.215 arcsec pixel@xmath68 , although this scale is compressed ( more arcsec pixel@xmath68 ) by 1/(cos @xmath74 ) for tilted slits , where @xmath74 is the relative pa between the slit and the mask .",
    "individual exposure times ranged from 1800 sec to 2700 sec , with at least two exposures through each mask to help reject cosmic rays .",
    "spatial dithering was not possible due to the tilted slits .",
    "targets received between two and 17 exposures each , depending on priority and repeat placement on multiple masks .",
    "this resulted in total exposure times ranging from 9,900 to 50,000 sec per target .",
    "the weather was mostly clear and photometric but some exposures were affected by cirrus .",
    "the seeing was typically 1 .",
    "images of all the targets are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] , with the location and pa of each slitlet superposed .",
    "targets observed at multiple pas are shown once for each pa .",
    "we also included in our analysis some data from an earlier keck / lris observing run in april 1996 @xcite .",
    "the slits for that run s slitmasks were tilted only to accommodate multiple objects , not to align to the major axis of extended objects .",
    "nevertheless , some of those slits did fall at the same pa as the slits in the observing runs aimed at kinematic study , allowing us to add the datasets together .",
    "the new observations are summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] , and properties of the targets are listed in table  [ tab : targs ] .",
    "we reduced the keck / lris spectra using a combination of iraf tasks and custom iraf scripts and c routines .",
    "raw images were bias - subtracted , cosmic - ray cleaned , flat - field corrected , and geometrically corrected to account for optical distortion .",
    "the next stage was carried out in one of two ways : ( 1 ) the wavelength solutions for all the slits in a single exposure were measured simultaneously , the image was rebinned so that all slits had the same pixel - wavelength mapping and orientation perpendicular to the dispersion , and then background sky emission was subtracted and individual slits extracted as single two - dimensional spectra ; or ( 2 ) individual slits were extracted from each exposure and then treated as long - slit spectra : a wavelength solution was derived from a corresponding arc lamp image , the data were rectified , the wavelength solution was fine - tuned using night - sky emission lines , and background sky emission was subtracted .",
    "finally , for each slit all individual exposures were combined using exposure - time weighting and spatial registration to make a single two - dimensional , sky - subtracted spectrum .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra of most targets were extracted from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) image .",
    "representative 2d and all the 1d spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2da ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:1da ] , respectively .",
    "in this section we present several new redshifts in the hdf , and then describe our measurements of kinematic features in the reduced spectra and how we use them to derive estimates of dynamical masses , along with some significant caveats on those estimates .",
    "we examined each one - dimensional spectrum visually to measure or confirm the target s redshift . for difficult cases we tried cross - correlating the one - dimensional spectrum with various template spectra , including an average of confirmed lbg spectra from @xcite and a high - signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectrum of the gravitationally - lensed lbg ms 1512-cb-58 @xcite kindly provided by m. pettini . in no case",
    "did the cross - correlation produce a reliable new redshift . in all",
    ", we found three tentative and one robust new redshifts ; confirmed , refined , or constrained four more ; and were unable to obtain useful redshift constraints for two .",
    "we were also able to measure the redshift for a new lbg the image of which fell on one of the slits but that was not in our original target list , for a total of five new redshifts .",
    "table  [ tab : zs ] gives the redshift obtained for every object in the sample .",
    "the redshift quality @xmath77 is given on a scale from 1 to 4 such that @xmath78 means there is little hope of assigning a redshift given the signal - to - noise ratio in our data , 2 means real features are evident but the redshift is not secure , 3 means the redshift is probable , and @xmath79 means the redshift is definitely secure , with multiple spectral features identified .",
    "we next searched for evidence in our lbg spectra that would allow us to constrain their dynamical state or even estimate their masses or their host halo masses .",
    "measuring robust dynamical masses , however , is not straightforward , and the mass estimates we derive are subject to several major caveats .",
    "we discuss some of the most significant of these below .",
    "the velocities and velocity limits we measure may simply not reflect orbital motion under gravity .",
    "peculiar motion of galaxies or subgalactic clumps in unvirialized systems such as loose groups or very young clusters could play a significant role .",
    "chance near superposition of physically unrelated sources could also lead to erroneous mass estimates .",
    "since many of our targets are indeed clumps of knots or close pairs , these factors may strongly affect our results and interpretation .    to try to assess the significance of the non - virialization scenario , we turn to the `` phenomenological '' n - body and semi - analytic @xmath80cdm galaxy formation models of @xcite .",
    "their `` model 3 '' represents a combination of two scenarios : star formation dominated by quiescent star formation in disks , usually just the central galaxy , and star formation dominated by merger - induced starbursts ( both galaxy - galaxy and halo - halo mergers ) .",
    "one run of that model produced 13,257 simulated lbgs at @xmath81 `` detected '' in 1 deg@xmath82 with criteria similar to those used by @xcite .",
    "we searched the catalog for projected close pairs of lbgs and examined their characteristics .",
    "we find 1206 pairs with separation @xmath83 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] , we plot the relative velocity @xmath84 in each pair vs. the projected separation @xmath85 on the sky , where the velocities are calculated using the two galaxies redshifts and their peculiar velocities .",
    "we focus on the simulated pairs with redshift difference @xmath86 ( where `` redshift '' means cosmological redshift only , without considering peculiar velocity ) , which we take to be truly physically related .",
    "there are 103 such pairs in the simulated catalog , or 8.5% of all pairs with @xmath87 ; these are represented as open triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] .",
    "we also plot the values for the four close pairs in our sample ( see   [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we calculate for each simulated close pair of lbgs a dynamical mass    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the maximum observed circular velocity , which in this case we take as @xmath84 , and @xmath90 is the radius at which the velocity is measured , in this case the separation between the pair .",
    "we also calculate the total ( dark matter ) halo mass of each pair as the sum of the two individual halo masses listed for the galaxies in the simulation catalog .",
    "[ fig : mhmv ] shows calculated dynamical mass vs. total halo mass for the close pairs in the simulation of @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , there is no strong correlation seen .",
    "this implies that the velocities in fact do not ( or not always ) reflect true virial velocities",
    ". they may instead reflect infall velocities of subclumps or galaxies streaming into a potential well ; such infall velocities are likely larger than virial velocities by at least a factor of two .",
    "we conclude that , if the simulation of @xcite is correct , the pair - wise velocities in our lbg sample may provide at best weak constraints on the true total masses of our lbg systems .",
    "a second caveat is that we may be sampling the kinematics of only a small region , either central to a larger potential well or embedded but not centered in a large massive proto - galactic cloud or even a large but uv - faint galaxy .",
    "as discussed above in   [ sec : intro ] , several recent groups have used optical and nir photometry to study the rest - optical seds of lbgs in the hdf - n , and found that their stellar masses were typically @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "these stellar masses provide a firm lower limit to the total dynamical mass .    in the local universe ,",
    "rotation curves of massive disk galaxies rapidly reach maximum rotational velocity @xmath92 , typically within a few kpc @xcite , similar to the half - light radii of the lbgs studied here .",
    "therefore , if lbg kinematics behave at all like those of local disks then we might not in fact be missing higher rotation velocities from faint extended regions below our detection limit ( although we could be missing faint emission at the same velocity from larger radii , which would raise the mass estimates ) . similarly , the central velocity dispersions @xmath93 of massive local elliptical galaxies are generally excellent indicators of the total galactic virial mass as measured by independent methods @xcite .",
    "again this implies that even if lbgs reside in larger systems , the total mass may be well - sampled by the lbg kinematics .",
    "finally , we can compare lbgs at @xmath15 to luminous compact blue galaxies ( lcbgs ) at redshifts @xmath4 , which have many properties similar to those of lbgs such as small half - light sizes @xmath94kpc , high luminosities @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 is the characteristic luminosity in a schechter luminosity function of galaxies today ) , blue optical colors , diverse , irregular morphologies , asymmetries @xmath97 , star formation rates @xmath98 , and narrow optical emission lines , @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found from deep optical imaging that more than half of the 27 compact narrow emission line galaxies ( cnelgs , close cousins of lcbgs ) at @xmath100 in their sample had sizes consistent with small local dwarfs , arguing against massive underlying host galaxies .",
    "similar results derive from studies of nearby compact uv - luminous galaxies using galex @xcite .",
    "the overall picture is that lcbgs at intermediate redshift are galaxies with luminosity @xmath95 but masses only 1/10th that of a typical @xmath96 galaxy , and dynamical / stellar mass ratios @xmath101 .",
    "constraints on stellar mass do not address the question of extended massive dark matter or gas halos surrounding the lbgs , of course .",
    "however , like measurements of local galaxy halo masses using satellite galaxy kinematics @xcite , our constraints on the dynamical masses of close pair lbg systems are insensitive to mass - to - light - ratio or stellar population uncertainties .",
    "the third significant caveat regarding our mass estimates is that the ly@xmath23  emission linewidths we use to estimate dynamical masses of individual lbgs and sub - clumps are subject to the influence of bulk inflows and outflows of gas , strong absorption by dust , and multiple scattering by neutral hydrogen , all of which can change the line profile .",
    "such effects have been studied theoretically by several groups ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observational evidence includes the systematic asymmetry and redshifting of the ly@xmath23  emission line - presumably due to a combination of outflows and absorption by foreground dust  in lbgs and local starbursts @xcite , and @xcite find that the ly@xmath23  emission of local starburst galaxies is spatially more extended than the continuum emission , presumably due to resonant scattering .",
    "we searched for but could not find any published or unpublished direct comparison between observed linewidths of ly@xmath23  and those of h@xmath23  or other non - resonance nebular emission lines .",
    "therefore our mass estimates based on ly@xmath23  emission line widths must be regarded as tentative .",
    "finally , we generally lack constraints on the inclination angle @xmath74 of our targets , so each mass has associated with it an unknown sin @xmath74 correction factor .",
    "apart from estimating or measuring inclinations of individual lbgs ( as done by , e.g. , bouch et al 2007 ) , this problem can be addressed only by assuming an average inclination or else assembling a large enough sample of kinematic measurements that all inclinations are statistically well represented .",
    "given the caveats discussed above , we will proceed with caution in analyzing lbg dynamics from our sample . here",
    "we make an empirical distinction between _ individual lyman break galaxies _ , with any multiple knots of emission connected by continuous flux visible in the hdf images and usually separated by @xmath1021  or less , and _ lbg systems _ , consisting of two or more lbgs without obvious extended emission bridging the gap(s ) between them .",
    "both categories may correspond to star - forming galaxies or sub - galactic clumps embedded in low - mass or massive dark matter halos , and both may yield useful constraints on dynamical mass .",
    "the lbg systems offer an additional opportunity to measure the total host halo mass as opposed to masses of subclumps or individual lbgs , although given the results of our examination of the simulation of @xcite , we will not assume that such results are robust .",
    "we examined visually the two - dimensional spectra of all 22 of the high - priority targets for evidence of any of the following : ( 1 ) spatially extended emission lines , especially ly@xmath23  but also including c  iv  and he  ii ; ( 2 ) spectrally unresolved , resolved , or multiple - peaked emission lines , especially from lbgs with multiple knot morphologies ; ( 3 ) extended continuum against which extended absorption lines might be detected ; and ( 4 ) emission and/or absorption lines from close pairs of galaxies .",
    "the features detected are listed in table  [ tab : zs ] .    for each lbg or lbg system with evidence of kinematic information ,",
    "we then estimated the dynamical mass .",
    "for simple gravitational rotation , the dynamical mass would be @xmath103 as in eq .",
    "[ eq : mdyn ] above .",
    "we divide our mass estimates into two categories : ( 1 ) masses estimated from extended emission or absorption or multiple sources ; and ( 2 ) masses estimated solely from the ly@xmath23  emission line velocity width and observed half - light radius . the measured velocity and size parameters and derived mass estimates for our sample",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : mass ] .",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] the distribution of velocities , which range from @xmath104 to nearly 5000 @xmath76 , and projected separations of the four close pair systems with the prediction of model 3 of @xcite .",
    "the pair with the largest @xmath84 appears to lie outside the locus of simulated pairs with small @xmath105 ( triangle symbols ; assumed to be physically associated , rather than just chance projection ) , but there are some simulated pairs with small @xmath105 and even larger @xmath84 than that target ",
    "i.e. , two lbgs within a few @xmath106 kpc of each other but with very high relative velocity , @xmath107 . to assess the probability @xmath108 that each pair in our sample is a true physical association , we can compare the density of small-@xmath105 pairs ( triangles ) to the density of large-@xmath105 pairs ( dots ) in different sections of the simulated @xmath109 plane .",
    "we divide fig .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] into eight equal segments bounded by 1 , 4 , and 7  and 0 , 2000 , 4000 , 6000 , and 8000 km / s .",
    "pairs with separation @xmath110are excluded because we would be unlikely to resolve such pairs spatially given the typical seeing in our data .",
    "we calculate the probability @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the number of small-@xmath105 and total pairs , respectively , in each section .",
    "we find that @xmath108 ranges from 57% for the two real lbg pairs ( @xmath114 symbol ) in the lower left corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] to 6% for the pair in the upper middle section .",

    "this must be due to our color selection function , which is somewhat different from that of @xcite and may be less restrictive , as mentioned above ; our magnitude limit , which is 1 - 2 mags fainter than most previous spectroscopic surveys of lbgs ; our use of the 600  l / mm grating , which provides less spectral coverage than the lower - resolution gratings commonly used for lbg redshift surveys ; or a combination of those effects .",
    "eleven of the 13 lbgs with kinematic signatures show spatially extended emission or absorption : eight are in close pairs , two contain three or four knots of emission each , and one is a clumpy elongated source extending over 3or @xmath102 25 kpc .",

    "the tentative dynamical masses we derive for individual lbgs , @xmath257 to @xmath7 , are very similar to those measured for brighter targets by @xcite based on h@xmath23kinematics measured with vlt / sinfoni , @xmath258 , implying that either ly@xmath23  and h@xmath23  emission linewidth measurements are both robust or else they both suffer from complications of comparable scale . @xcite also extrapolate the velocities beyond the half - light radii to estimate the virial mass of a typical halo , finding @xmath259 , similar to the halo masses inferred by @xcite based on clustering .",
    "in contrast , the median dynamical mass @xmath260 that we measure for our four close - pair systems is an order of magnitude larger , and the maximum system dynamical mass estimate is @xmath261 , more than @xmath262 above the mean halo mass of @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that in no case in our sample is the derived dynamical mass less than the reported stellar mass for the same galaxy (   [ sec : mstar ] ) , which is reassuring .",
    "having measured redshifts and searched our spectra for dynamical signatures in 13 lbgs and lbg systems , we now compare those results to several other observational results and to theoretical expectations in order to explore implications for galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "many lines of evidence point to the importance of merging in galaxy evolution over the entire cosmic history of galaxies . in this section",
    "we explore the possibility that our sample of lbgs includes a significant merger fraction , and we compare the characteristics of our sample directly to the predictions of galaxy formation theories , including masses and close pair fractions .",
    "cold accretion of gas and dark matter not associated with major majors is also increasingly appreciated as a significant source of fresh material for star formation and mass buildup @xcite . but major mergers , where the components have roughly equal mass , can erase disk morphologies and produce starbursts , agns , and elliptical galaxies , and even minor mergers can induce bursts of star formation or disturbed morphologies @xcite .",
    "recent works have measured the evolution of the rate of galaxy mergers , the fraction of close pairs of galaxies , and the distribution of galaxy morphologies over cosmic time @xcite .",
    "essentially all of those results are consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation models , in which galaxy mass is assembled largely through merging .    as noted above , early studies of lbgs recognized the high rate of close pairs and multiple knots @xcite . of",
    "the 14 confirmed lbgs in our sample , 12 are in close pairs or have multiple - knot or highly extended , clumpy morphologies .",
    "all 12 are therefore excellent candidates for merging systems .",
    "indeed , every close pair in our sample yielded potential kinematic information ; conversely , the targets that failed to provide such information were predominantly low - surface brightness , elongated , diffuse sources , which may themselves be interacting or merging systems . our entire sample , of course , is strongly biased away from isolated , symmetrical morphologies by virtue of our visual selection process , so it is to be expected that the sample would show a higher fraction of merging systems than do magnitude - limited lbg samples .",
    "our sample contains only four close pair systems , so it is subject both to small number statistics and especially to the assumption that the pairwise velocities indicate dynamical mass ( see   [ sec : techniques ] ) .",
    "the components of the four pairs may be subclumps in various stages of infall and virialization , in which case their relative velocities could be dominated by random rather than circular motions .",
    "they may , however , also reflect a true , large range in the masses of the lbg host halos .",
    "the theoretical implications of observed lbg close pair incidence and velocity distributions for galaxy formation models have been explored in detail by several groups @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that different models predicted very different halo occupation distributions , i.e. the number of lbgs per dark matter halo .",
    "in most @xmath80cdm models , the number of lbgs predicted per halo increases with mass , with typically @xmath42 lbg halo@xmath68 for @xmath263 and @xmath13 .",
    "the number of close pairs of galaxies  defined as galaxies within a given angular separation within a redshift interval @xmath264  is an especially sensitive discriminator between models .",
    "specifically , compared to the observed number of close lbg pairs , models postulating a one - to - one correspondence between lbgs and massive dark matter halos ( `` massive halo '' models ) underpredict close pairs by @xmath265 , while the `` colliding halo '' model overpredicts close pairs by @xmath266 within 15 .",
    "the best agreement was provided by their `` collisional starburst models '' , in which lbgs host both ongoing quiescent star formation and rapid bursts of star formation triggered by minor and major galaxy mergers .    to compare the observed incidence of close pairs in our sample with the models of @xcite",
    ", we first note that only two of the four systems we call `` close pairs '' satisfy the @xcite criterion @xmath264 . fig .",
    "6 in that paper shows the fraction @xmath267 as a function of pair separation for different models .",
    "all four of the pairs in our sample have separation @xmath268 , so they all fall in the first bin in the figure .",
    "if we assume that we have observed all the close pairs in the hdf survey volume in that separation bin , i.e. the total number of close pairs with @xmath264 is @xmath269 , and further that the total number of galaxies in the survey volume with comparable selection criteria is roughly the number of lbg candidates in the hdf times the success rate we observe here , or @xmath270 , then we find @xmath271 .",
    "this value is already marginally inconsistent with ( higher than ) the values , all @xmath272 , predicted by the collisional starburst , constant efficiency quiescent , and accelerated quiescent models in fig .  6 of @xcite ; the massive halo model underpredicts close pairs by a factor of more than @xmath273 ( including only the error bars of wechsler et al 2001 ) . the colliding halo model , on the other hand , overpredicts it by a factor of less than @xmath274 .",
    "obviously , with such small numbers of close pairs and large uncertainties on the selection function and completeness of our sample , the observed incidence ratios should be viewed as only tentative .",
    "the close pairs and multiple knot systems we study here all have maximum angular separation @xmath83 , and therefore all fall in the first bin in the separation - pair fraction plot ( fig .",
    "6 ) of @xcite , where indeed the discrimination among models is the strongest . because of the biased nature of our target selection , we do not attempt to compare quantitatively the observed pair fraction with the predicted one .",
    "but we do note that close pairs are represented over the entire range of dynamical masses we derive , @xmath275 .",
    "this distribution is likely due either to ( 1 ) misinterpretation of the kinematic signatures ( i.e. the velocities are not due primarily to orbital motion under gravity ) , resulting in erroneous mass estimates or ( 2 ) misidentification of individual knots of emission as separate galaxies , thus complicating the comparison with the models ; or else ( 3 ) it is inconsistent with the general prediction of @xcite that the number of lbgs per halo should increase with halo mass .",
    "@xcite use observed sizes and sfrs of lbgs to conclude from their models that lbgs must be hosted by halos with circular velocities @xmath276 , although for some combinations of gas - to - total and dust - to - total mass ratios the distribution can reach 400 @xmath76 .",
    "if lbg close - pair dynamics are indeed indicative of host halo mass , then the range of halo masses in our sample is significantly larger and the typical mass significantly higher than predicted by @xcite . @xcite further explore the possibility of using the observed pairwise velocity distribution ( pvd ) to discriminate between different galaxy formation models , but their investigation focuses on scales between 100 @xmath232 kpc and 30 @xmath232 mpc , much larger than the 10-kpc scale of multiple - knot and close pair targets studied here .",
    "@xcite analyze dark matter halo @xmath44-body simulations and report that mass accretion occurs in a rapid phase , during which the halo s circular velocity is also predicted to rise rapidly , followed by a slow phase , during which the circular velocity remains almost constant .",
    "however , they examine only isolated halos with total mass fixed at @xmath277 , for which the maximum circular velocity predicted is @xmath163 and the maximum halo radius is @xmath278 kpc .",
    "these spatial scales are roughly comparable to those of three systems in our sample : two close pairs and the highly extended source c4 - 06 .",
    "the velocity scale is comparable in only one close pair system .",
    "most of the lbgs and lbg systems in our sample are therefore not apparently well described by the models of @xcite . however",
    ", if we interpret our results within their framework , the large range in system dynamical masses we derive could imply that we are seeing the systems at different evolutionary stages , some before the rapid mass accretion phase is completed and the circular velocity plateaus , and some after .",
    "typical group - sized halos today have circular velocities @xmath279 , and cluster halos have circular velocities @xmath280 .",
    "only one of our lbg system velocities lies well above that range , with @xmath281 ; the rest have velocities consistent with those of normal galaxies to normal clusters of galaxies today .",
    "as noted above in   [ sec : kin ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] ) , the distribution of pairwise velocities and projected separations of our four pairs is consistent with the predictions of model 3 of @xcite , supporting their scenario of quiescent disk star formation combined with merger - induced starbursts .",
    "the dynamical masses we derive span the range of masses of dwarf galaxies to giant elliptical galaxies today .",
    "our modest sample is certainly biased and is not representative of all lbgs at @xmath81 .",
    "the range of estimated dynamical masses is similar to that derived for simulated lbgs in model 3 of @xcite (   [ sec : kin ] ) , but the kinematics of both simulated and real datasets may in fact not reflect true virial masses , especially given the lack of correlation with combined halo mass in the simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mhmv ] ) .",
    "however , taken together , the sizes , sfrs , morphologies , velocities , and derived individual and system dynamical masses of the lbgs in our sample imply a large range of physical scenarios and dark matter halo masses .",
    "they also further suggest that , rather than being identified one - to - one with the centers of future massive spheroids , bulges , or elliptical galaxies , lbgs are merging sub - clumps within halos that are destined to become galaxies with a large range of masses and potentially of morphological type as well .",
    "this scenario is consistent with hybrid galaxy formation models such as the favored collisional starburst model of @xcite and @xcite , but not with their massive halo model .",
    "here we compare our kinematic mass estimates to the stellar masses of the same galaxies calculated by sed fitting .",

    "the stellar mass estimates for 765 of 1682 nicmos - detected sources with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts have since been supplemented by photometry from _ spitzer_/irac and were kindly provided to us by c. papovich ( 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "we searched the _",

    "we consider below the stellar mass estimate of only the high - redshift source .",
    "the low - redshift source certainly contributes flux to our spectrum .",

    ". on the other hand , the redshift @xmath286 of the low - redshift source may be in error ; if the correct redshift is in fact close to @xmath287 , then the stellar mass estimate for hd3_1633_1909 would increase by roughly a factor of two .",
    "we make the following three comparisons of the stellar mass estimates to our dynamical mass estimates : ( 1 ) for the eight ly@xmath23  linewidth - based dynamical mass estimates or upper limits , we compare those values directly with the single matching stellar mass estimates ( seven sources ) or the two components of a double match ( one source , c4 - 09 ) for a total of nine comparisons ; ( 2 ) for the three individual but extended or clumpy sources with single or multiple matches in the nicmos catalog , we combine the stellar mass estimates and compare the total to our individual lbg dynamical mass estimated from extended absorption or emission velocity or , if neither of those is available , from ly@xmath23  linewidth ; and ( 3 ) for the close pairs , we combine the two stellar mass estimates and compare the sum to the system dynamical ( halo ) mass from the pair s relative velocity .",
    "the four - knot source c4 - 09 , which yields both ly@xmath23  linewidths and a double emission line peak , presumably from different emission knots , has two nicmos matches , so we apply both comparison types 1 and 2 ( i.e. we separately compare the smaller dynamical and stellar masses  perhaps due to individual knots  and the combined stellar and system dynamical masses ) .",
    "these comparisons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m * ] .",
    "the individual lbg stellar masses ( comparison types 1 and 2 above ) range from @xmath288 to @xmath289 with a median of @xmath290 .",
    "two sources show stellar masses roughly equal to their dynamical masses . the stellar mass range and median , however , are both less than the range and median of dynamical masses ; the typical mass ratio @xmath291 , comparable to those of lcbgs at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses are also small compared to those measured for 181 lbgs in the egs by @xcite , @xmath292 with median @xmath293 .",

    "they also found that @xmath296 of their sample had large dynamical - to - stellar mass ratios @xmath297 ( vs. 10/12 = 83% for our sample ) , suggesting that this was likely due to young galaxy ages that had not yet built up significant stellar mass , or else faint older stellar populations that escaped detection .",
    "the same scenarios may explain the large dynamical - to - stellar mass ratios and lack of correlation we observe .",
    "our sample is more than one magnitude fainter than that of @xcite , so we are probing farther down the lbg luminosity function .",

    "the large range is presumably due to a combination of galaxy age ( older systems showing stronger nir flux from stars ) , burst age ( younger systems showing stronger uv flux from stars ) , merging history , and dust obscuration .",
    "the large range we observe in dynamical - to - stellar mass ratio may in fact reflect a wide range of intrinsic lbg properties including dark matter halo or sub - clump mass , star formation history , merging history and status , and burst age .",

    "[ fig : m * ] shows the comparison . here the range in combined stellar mass is smaller than for the individual lbgs , while the range in system dynamical mass is larger .",
    "the average total stellar mass is @xmath300 , and the average system dynamical - to - stellar mass ratio is @xmath301 , ranging from @xmath302 to @xmath303 .",
    "this large mass ratio range suggests that one or both of two scenarios are at play : ( 1 ) the lbgs are embedded in dark matter halos with a wide range of masses that are not strongly correlated to the luminosity and star formation rates of the lbgs they host ; and ( 2 ) the relative velocities of the close pairs may reflect various stages of infall , i.e. not all the close pairs are necessarily in virialized systems ( see   [ sec : techniques ] ) .",
    "we have studied candidate and confirmed lbgs at @xmath52 in the hdf - n with deep two - dimensional spectroscopy , finding 3 tentative and 2 robust new redshifts .",
    "we also find evidence for kinematics in 13 lbgs and four lbg close - pair systems . the observed morphologies and dynamics , including numerous cases of close pairs and multiple sources ,",
    "appear to be most consistent with collisional starburst models of galaxy formation , rather than massive halo models with only one lbg per halo .",
    "we derived tentative dynamical mass estimates from the observed velocity signatures , finding a range from @xmath304 to @xmath251 with a median @xmath305 for the individual lbgs and a range from @xmath253 to @xmath254 with a median mass @xmath255 for the close - pair systems .",
    "all the mass estimates are subject to strong caveats including unknown inclination corrections , ly@xmath23  absorption , outflows , and non - virialized systems .",
    "all our dynamical mass estimates are larger than the corresponding stellar mass measurements .",
    "however , we find no evidence for a correlation between stellar mass and dynamical mass , in contrast to the weak correlation found by @xcite for their sample of brighter , lower - redshift sources .",
    "we argue on the basis of comparison with local compact starburst galaxies , other studies of distant star - forming galaxies , and galaxy formation theories and simulations that the sizes , sfrs , morphologies , velocities , and dynamical mass estimates imply a wide range of physical scenarios and mass scales giving rise to lbgs at @xmath52 .",
    "given the large time investment at keck needed to observe even this small sample , further progress in constraining the dynamical masses of lbgs will require technological advances including the deep diffraction - limited imaging and spectroscopy promised by _ james webb space telescope _ and increasingly available through adaptive optics and nir integral field spectroscopy at ground - based 10-meter class telescopes .",
    "many thanks are due to the staff of the keck observatory for their help and expertise in carrying out the observations .",
    "we appreciate assistance from sandra faber , drew phillips , and nicole vogt during the observations , and from dan kelson , gabriela mallen - ornelas , and nathan roche in reducing the data .",
