    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions produce a hot , dense phase of strongly - interacting matter commonly known as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which rapidly expands and freezes into discrete particles @xcite .",
    "since the qgp is not directly observable  only final - state hadrons and electromagnetic probes are detected  present research relies on dynamical models to establish the connection between observable quantities and the physical properties of interest .",
    "the output of these dynamical model simulations are analogous to experimental measurements as they provide final state particle distributions from which a wide variety of observables related to the bulk properties of qcd matter can be obtained .",
    "in addition , dynamical models also provide information on the full space - time evolution of the qcd medium .",
    "this information can be utilized for the study of rare probes , such as jets , heavy quarks and electromagnetic radiation that are sensitive to the properties of the medium either via re - interaction with the qgp constituents or its production .",
    "there exist a variety of different dynamical models , based on different transport concepts that have been successful in describing current data measured at the relativistic heavy - ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory and at the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "these models may differ in their assumptions on the formation of the deconfined phase of qcd matter , the nature of its dynamical evolution , the mechanism of hadron formation and freeze - out and on many other details .",
    "a key question that needs to be addressed is how sensitive current observables are to these differences and what kind of strategy to pursue to ascertain which of these model features reflect the actual physical nature of the hot and dense qcd system .    in this paper",
    "we perform a comparison of two prominent models for the evolution of bulk qcd matter .",
    "the first one is a non - equilibrium transport approach , the parton - hadron - string - dynamics ( phsd )  @xcite , and the second one a 2d+1 viscous hydrodynamical model , vishnew  @xcite which is based on the assumption of local equilibrium and conservation laws .",
    "non - equilibrium effects are considered to be strongest during the early phase of the heavy - ion reaction and thus may significantly impact the properties of probes with early production times , such as heavy quarks ( charm and bottom hadrons ) , electromagnetic probes ( direct photons and dileptons ) , and jets . moreover , some bulk observables , such as correlation functions and higher - order anisotropy coefficients , might also retain traces of non - equilibrium effects @xcite . in particular , the impact of the event - by event fluctuations on the collective observables has been studied by kodama et al .",
    "@xcite . based on the comparison of the coarse - grained hydrodynamical evolution with the phsd dynamics",
    ", they find that in spite of large fluctuations on event - by - event basis in the phsd , the ensemble averages are close to the hydrodynamical limit .",
    "a similar behavior has been pointed out before within the phsd study in ref .",
    "@xcite where a linear correlation of the elliptic flow @xmath2 with the initial spatial eccentricity @xmath3 has been obtained for the model study of an expanding partonic fireball ( cf .",
    "fig . 7 in ref .",
    "such correlations of @xmath2 versus @xmath3 are expected in the ideal hydrodynamical case  @xcite .",
    "the large event - by - event fluctuations of the charge distributions has been addressed also in another phsd study @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "our focus will be on isolating differences in the dynamical evolution of the system that can be attributed to non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the groundwork laid in this comparative study will hopefully lead to the development of new observables that have an enhanced sensitivity to the non - equilibrium components of the evolution of bulk qcd matter and that will allow us to quantify how far off equilibrium the system actually evolves .",
    "the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) transport approach  @xcite is a microscopic covariant dynamical model for strongly interacting systems formulated on the basis of kadanoff - baym equations @xcite for green s functions in phase - space representation ( in first order gradient expansion beyond the quasi - particle approximation ) .",
    "the approach consistently describes the full evolution of a relativistic heavy - ion collision from the initial hard scatterings and string formation through the dynamical deconfinement phase transition to the strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) as well as hadronization and the subsequent interactions in the expanding hadronic phase as in the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach @xcite .",
    "the transport theoretical description of quarks and gluons in the phsd is based on the dynamical quasi - particle model ( dqpm ) for partons that is constructed to reproduce lattice qcd results for the qgp in thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite on the basis of effective propagators for quarks and gluons .",
    "the dqpm is thermodynamically consistent and the effective parton propagators incorporate finite masses ( scalar mean - fields ) for gluons / quarks as well as a finite width that describes the medium dependent reaction rate . for fixed thermodynamic parameters",
    "@xmath4 the partonic width s @xmath5 fix the effective two - body interactions that are presently implemented in the phsd  @xcite .",
    "the phsd differs from conventional boltzmann approaches in a couple of essential aspects : i ) it incorporates dynamical quasi - particles due to the finite width of the spectral functions ( imaginary part of the propagators ) ;",
    "ii ) it involves scalar mean - fields that substantially drive the collective flow in the partonic phase ; iii ) it is based on a realistic equation of state from lattice qcd and thus describes the speed of sound @xmath6 reliably ; iv ) the hadronization is described by the fusion of off - shell partons to off - shell hadronic states ( resonances or strings ) and does not violate the second law of thermodynamics ; v ) all conservation laws ( energy - momentum , flavor currents etc . )",
    "are fulfilled in the hadronization contrary to coalescence models ; vi ) the effective partonic cross sections are not given by pqcd but are self - consistently determined within the dqpm and probed by transport coefficients ( correlators ) in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the latter can be calculated within the dqpm or can be extracted from the phsd by performing calculations in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions ( shear- and bulk viscosity , electric conductivity , magnetic susceptibility etc .",
    "both methods show a good agreement .    in the beginning of relativistic heavy - ion collisions color - neutral strings ( described by the lund model  @xcite )",
    "are produced in highly energetic scatterings of nucleons from the impinging nuclei .",
    "these strings are dissolved into pre - hadrons with a formation time of @xmath7 0.8 fm / c in the rest frame of the corresponding string , except for the leading hadrons. those are the fastest residues of the string ends , which can re - interact ( practically instantly ) with hadrons with a reduced cross sections in line with quark counting rules . if , however , the local energy density is larger than the critical value for the phase transition , which is taken to be @xmath7 0.5 @xmath8 , the pre - hadrons melt into ( colored ) effective quarks and antiquarks in their self - generated repulsive mean - field as defined by the dqpm  @xcite . in the dqpm",
    "the quarks , antiquarks and gluons are dressed quasi - particles and have temperature - dependent effective masses and widths which have been fitted to lattice thermal quantities such as energy density , pressure and entropy density .",
    "the nonzero width of the quasi - particles implies the off - shellness of partons , which is taken into account in the scattering and propagation of partons in the qgp on the same footing ( i.e. propagators and couplings ) .",
    "the transition from the partonic to hadronic degrees - of - freedom ( for light quarks / antiquarks ) is described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark - antiquark pairs to mesonic resonances or three quarks ( antiquarks ) to baryonic states , i.e. by the dynamical hadronization . note",
    "that due to the off - shell nature of both partons and hadrons , the hadronization process described above obeys all conservation laws ( i.e. four - momentum conservation and flavor current conservation ) in each event , as well as the detailed balance relations and the increase in the total entropy @xmath9 . in the hadronic phase phsd",
    "is equivalent to the hadron - strings dynamics ( hsd ) model @xcite that has been employed in the past from schwerionen - synchrotron ( sis ) to sps energies . on the other hand the phsd approach has been applied to p+p , p+a and relativistic heavy - ion collisions from lower sps to lhc energies and been successful in describing a large number of experimental data including single - particle spectra , collective flow as well as electromagnetic probes  @xcite .",

    "in this section we describe the construction of the initial condition for the hydrodynamical evolution from the non - equilibrium phsd evolution .",
    "one should note that phsd starts its calculation ab initio with two colliding nuclei and makes no equilibrium assumptions regarding the nature of the hot and dense system during the course of its evolution from initial nuclear overlap to final hadronic freeze - out . for the purpose of our comparison we have to select the earliest possible time during the phsd evolution where the system is in a state in which a hydrodynamical evolution is feasible ( e.g. the viscous corrections are already small enough ) and generate an initial condition for the hydrodynamical calculation at that time ( note that this criterion is less stringent than assuming full momentum isotropization or local thermal equilibrium ) .",

    "consequently , @xmath91 is larger than in the scenario without initial flow throughout the entire evolution of the medium and an enhanced elliptic flow can be expected .",
    "given the unresolved question of bulk viscosity in heavy - ion collisions , we investigate the effect of tuning the bulk viscosity from the standard value discussed at the beginning of this section to four times of this value , which comes closer to the bulk viscosity found in different quasi - particle calculations @xcite .",
    "we see that for an enhanced bulk viscosity around @xmath96 the momentum anisotropy develops a bump at later times , which is more pronounced for larger bulk viscosity .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : eccenp ] the hydrodynamical simulation is compared to the results from phsd , again for event - by - event averaged quantities and the event - by - event fluctuations indicated by the spread of the cloud .",
    "the phsd momentum eccentricity is constructed by eq .",
    "( [ epsprime ] ) where @xmath21 is evaluated from eq .",
    "( [ tmunuphsd ] ) .",
    "it can be observed that before @xmath59 the averaged momentum anisotropy in phsd develops continuously during the initial stage , before it reaches the value which is provided in the initial conditions for hydrodynamics . despite the seemingly large bulk viscosity ,",
    "as discussed in the beginning of this section , the momentum anisotropy in phsd does not show any hint of a bump like in the hydrodynamical calculation .",
    "the response to intrinsic bulk viscosity in a microscopic transport model does not seem to be as strong as in hydrodynamics .",
    "in this paper , we have compared two commonly used descriptions of the evolution of a qgp medium in heavy - ion collisions , the microscopic off - shell transport approach phsd and a macroscopic hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "both approaches give an excellent agreement with numerous experimental data , despite the very different assumptions inherent in these models . in phsd ,",
    "quasi - particles are treated in off - shell transport with thermal masses and widths which reproduce the lattice qcd equation of state and are determined from parallel event runs in the simulations .",
    "hydrodynamics assumes local equilibrium to be reached in the initial stages of heavy - ion collisions and transports energy - momentum and charge densities according to the lattice qcd equation of state and transport coefficients such as the shear and bulk viscosity .",
    "we have tried to match the hydrodynamical evolution as closely as possible to these quantities as obtained within phsd :",
    "1 .   by construction",
    "the equation of state in phsd is compatible with the lqcd equation of state used in the hydrodynamical evolution 2 .",
    "a new landau - matching procedure was used to determine initial conditions for hydrodynamics from the phsd simulation , 3 .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations utilize the same @xmath61 as obtained within phsd and 4 .",
    "different bulk viscosity parameterizations have been introduced in the hydrodynamical simulation that resemble to those obtained in ( dynamical ) quasi - particle models , which are the basis for phsd simulations .",
    "in general we find that the ensemble averages over phsd events follow closely the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "the major differences between the macroscopic near-(local)-equilibrium and the microscopic off - equilibrium dynamics can be summarized as :    1 .   a strong short - wavelength spatial irregularity in phsd at all times during the evolution versus a fast smoothing of initial irregularities in the hydrodynamical evolution such that only global long - wavelength structures survive .",
    "these structures have been calculated on the level of the fluid velocity and energy density and quantified in terms of the fourier modes of the energy density . due to the qcd equation of state",
    "the irregularities imprinted in the temperature are smaller than in the energy density itself .",
    "the hydrodynamical response to changing transport coefficients , especially the bulk viscosity , has a strong impact on the time evolution of the momentum anisotropy . in phsd",
    "these transport coefficients can be determined but remain intrinsically linked to the interaction cross sections .",
    "although there are indications for a substantial bulk viscosity in phsd , it does not show the same sensitivity to the momentum space anisotropy as in hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "3 .   event - by - event fluctuations might be of similar magnitude in quantities like the spatial and momentum anisotropy but while they remain smooth functions of time in hydrodynamics significant variations are observed within in a single event in phsd as a function of time .",
    "after having gained an improved understanding of the similarities and differences in the evolution of bulk qcd matter between the non - equilibrium phsd and the equilibrium hydrodynamic approach , we plan to utilize our insights in future projects regarding the development of observables sensitive to non - equilibrium effects and the impact these effects may have on hard probe observables .",
