    "one of the most famous algebraic operads of topological origin is the operad of gerstenhaber algebras , which is the homology operad of the topological operad of little @xmath4-disks  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 component of the operad of little @xmath4-discs is homotopy equivalent to the configuration space of @xmath6 ordered points in  @xmath7 whose fundamental group is the pure braid group on @xmath6 strands .",
    "one natural way to generalise braid groups is to consider configurations of subsets that have more interesting topology than points .",
    "the simplest example of these `` higher - dimensional '' versions of braid groups is given by `` groups of loops '' , the @xmath8 one being the group of motions of @xmath9 unknotted unlinked circles in  @xmath10 bringing each circle to its original position .",
    "alternatively , these groups can be viewed as groups of pure symmetric automorphisms of the free group with @xmath9 generators , that is automorphisms sending each generator to an element of its conjugacy class .",
    "the integral cohomology of these groups was computed by jensen , mccammond and meier in  @xcite ; that paper also contains references and historical information on this group . the description of the cohomology algebras in  @xcite looks very similar to that for pure braid groups  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as a symmetric collection , the collection of cohomology algebras is isomorphic to @xmath11 which bears striking resemblance with the isomorphism @xmath12 for the operad of gerstenhaber algebras .",
    "however , there is no natural operad structure on the collection of homology groups of the groups of loops .    in @xcite ,",
    "the second author computed the cohomology of the groups of pure symmetric automorphisms in a different way , as a particular case of a much more general result : for an arbitrary @xmath9-tuple of groups @xmath13 , he computed the cohomology of the fouxe - rabinovitch group @xmath14 of partial conjugation automorphisms of the free product @xmath15 .",
    "for that , he used a construction of a classifying space of that group via a moduli space of `` cactus products '' of the classifying spaces @xmath16 . in the case",
    "when @xmath17 , these spaces form a symmetric collection , but alas do not form a topological operad either . however , it turns out that they admit a slight modification that carries a structure of a topological operad ; the required change is that one of the spaces @xmath18 is chosen as the base and is required to sit at the root of each cactus .",
    "we call the modified space the space of based @xmath2-cacti",
    ". the goal of this paper is to understand the algebra and topology of this operad .    for homology with coefficients in a field",
    ", we show that the homology operad of the operad of based @xmath2-cacti is obtained from the homology coalgebra of @xmath2 by a formal algebraic procedure that only uses the augmentation and the coproduct ; thus , it is defined for every graded cocommutative coalgebra  @xmath1 , not necessarily the homology coalgebra of a topological space .",
    "remarkably , for every coalgebra @xmath1 this defined operad is koszul . to prove that , we use filtered distributive laws between operads , as defined by the second author in  @xcite .",
    "one immediate consequence of our results is that , for @xmath19 , the homology operad of based @xmath2-cacti is isomorphic , as an @xmath20-module , to @xmath21 , which , given that the operad of associative permutative algebras @xmath22 encodes commutative algebras with additional structure , may be naturally thought of as an `` operad - compatible improvement '' of the result of  @xcite mentioned above .",
    "our constructions are defined over a field of arbitrary characteristic , and our results on operads of based cacti hold in that generality .",
    "however , even the distributive law criterion for koszulness , let alone its filtered generalisation , has only been available in zero characteristic , since the known proofs @xcite rely on the knneth formula for symmetric collections .",
    "using the shuffle operads technique @xcite , we were able to obtain a characteristic - independent proof of this criterion .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : background ] , we recall necessary background information that we use throughout the paper . in section",
    "[ sec : top_cacti ] , we define the topological operads of based cacti and discuss its connections both with automorphism groups of free products and with other known topological operads . the homology operad for the operad of based cacti",
    "is computed in section  [ sec : homology ] . in section  [ sec : distr - laws ] , we discuss filtered distributive laws between quadratic operads .",
    "section  [ sec : koszul ] shows how to use filtered distributive laws to prove the koszul property for the linear operads of based cacti , and also discuss its applications to the operad of post - lie algebras and the operad of commutative tridendriform algebras .",
    "all `` linear '' objects in this paper ( algebras , coalgebras , operads ) will be enriched in a certain symmetric monoidal category  @xmath23 , usually the category @xmath24 of vector spaces or the category @xmath25 of graded vector spaces ( over some field  @xmath26 ; unless otherwise specified , we do not make any assumptions on its characteristic ) .",
    "whenever appropriate , we assume vector spaces to be finite - dimensional , or possessing an additional @xmath27-grading with finite - dimensional homogeneous components ; this allows to approach tensor constructions and duals with ease , freely pass between an algebra and its dual coalgebra etc .",
    "a _ tree _ is an acyclic connected graph and a _ rooted tree _ is a tree with a chosen vertex , the _",
    "root_. a rooted tree may be directed : every edge @xmath29 may be oriented to @xmath30 in such a way that the minimal path from @xmath31 to the chosen vertex contains @xmath29 . by the acyclicity of the tree",
    "this must hold for exactly one of the choices @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "the edges may be seen to be directed ` away from the roots ' .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the set of edges of a tree @xmath34 .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 is a tree with vertex set @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 be a @xmath35-tuple of topological spaces .",
    "then a _ @xmath28-tree _ is a rooted tree with an edge labelling where the edge @xmath37 is labelled by an element of @xmath18 . for a space @xmath2 as shorthand we define a @xmath2-tree to be a @xmath28-tree where the @xmath35-tuple @xmath28 is constantly @xmath2 .",
    "then the edge labelling is a map from the edge set @xmath38 to the space @xmath2 .",
    "meanwhile a @xmath2-forest is a @xmath28-tree where @xmath28 is the @xmath35-tuple with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the root vertex and @xmath41 for any other vertex .",
    "the naming makes sense because by removing the root @xmath40 and all adjacent vertices we are left with a disjoint union of @xmath2-trees ; the root of each tree is the unique vertex adjacent to @xmath40 and the edge labelling is inherited .    to a rooted tree",
    "@xmath34 we define the _ level _ @xmath42 to be the number of non - trivial directed paths in @xmath34 .",
    "so for a corolla with root @xmath43 and @xmath44 other vertices the level is @xmath44 , for a tree with root @xmath43 and edges @xmath45 for @xmath46 the level is @xmath47 .",
    "the level allows one to filter the set of @xmath28-trees .",
    "a coalgebra is an object  @xmath1 of @xmath48 equipped with a comultiplication @xmath49 and a counit @xmath50 satisfying the conventional coassociativity and counit axioms . for the comultiplication , we often use sweedler s notation @xmath51 .",
    "an augmented coalgebra is a coalgebra @xmath1 equipped with a coalgebra homomorphism @xmath52 such that @xmath53 .",
    "a cocommutative coalgebra is a coalgebra satisfying @xmath54 .",
    "our main focus will be on graded augmented cocommutative coalgebras , that is augmented cocommutative coalgebras in @xmath25 .",
    "the main source of such coalgebras relevant for our purposes is topology : the homology coalgebra of a pointed topological space  @xmath55 is a graded augmented cocommutative coalgebra .",
    "an augmented coalgebra in @xmath24 or @xmath25 naturally splits into a direct sum of vector spaces @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 .      for details on operads",
    "we refer the reader to the book  @xcite , for details on grbner bases for operads   to the paper  @xcite . in this section we only recall the key notions used throughout the paper . by an operad ( enriched in a symmetric monoidal category  @xmath23 ) we mean a monoid in one of the two monoidal categories : the category of symmetric @xmath48-collections equipped with the composition product or the category of nonsymmetric @xmath48-collections equipped with the shuffle composition product . the former kind of monoids is referred to as symmetric operads , the latter   as shuffle operads .",
    "we always assume that our collections are reduced , that is , have no elements of arity  @xmath40 .",
    "a good rule of thumb is that all operads defined in this paper are symmetric operads , but for computational purposes it is useful to treat them as shuffle operads .",
    "this does not lose any information except for the symmetric group actions , since the forgetful functor @xmath59 is monoidal and one - to - one on objects ( and therefore for tasks that can be formulated without the symmetric group actions , e.g. computing bases and dimensions of components , proving the koszul property etc .",
    ", we can choose arbitrarily whether to work with a symmetric operad or with its shuffle version ) . in the `` geometric '' setting",
    ", @xmath48 will usually be the category of sets , or topological spaces , or pointed topological spaces , in the `` linear '' setting   the category of vector spaces ( in which case symmetric collections are usually called @xmath20-modules ) , or the category of graded vector spaces or chain complexes ( in which case symmetric collections are called differential graded @xmath20-modules ) .",
    "a linear symmetric operad can also be thought as of collection of spaces of operations of some type , and therefore can be defined via its category of algebras , i.e. vector spaces where these operations act , via identities between operations acting on a vector space .    in the linear setting , a very useful technical tool for dealing with ( shuffle ) operads is given by grbner bases .",
    "more precisely , similarly to associative algebras , operads can be presented via generators and relations , that is as quotients of free operads @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the space of generators .",
    "the free shuffle operad generated by a given nonsymmetric collection admits a basis of `` tree monomials '' which can be defined combinatorially ; a shuffle composition of tree monomials is again a tree monomial .",
    "in addition to the `` arity '' of elements of a free operad , there is the notion of weight , similar to grading for associative algebras : we define the weight of a tree monomial as the number of generators used in this tree monomial .",
    "weight is well behaved under composition : when composing several tree monomials , the weight of the result is equal to the sum of their weights .",
    "for an arbitrary operad  @xmath62 whose relations @xmath63 are weight - homogeneous , the weight descends from the free operad @xmath60 on  @xmath64 ; the subcollection of  @xmath64 consisting of all elements of weight  @xmath6 is denoted by  @xmath65 .",
    "there exist several ways to introduce a total ordering of tree monomials in such a way that the operadic compositions are compatible with that total ordering .",
    "there is also a combinatorial definition of divisibility of tree monomials that agrees with the naive operadic definition : one tree monomial occurs as a subtree in another one if and only if the latter can be obtained from the former by operadic compositions .",
    "a grbner basis of an ideal @xmath66 of the free operad is a system @xmath67 of generators of  @xmath66 for which the leading monomial of every element of the ideal is divisible by one of the leading terms of elements of  @xmath67 .",
    "such a system of generators allows to perform `` long division '' modulo  @xmath66 , computing for every element its canonical representative .",
    "there exists an algorithmic way to compute a grbner basis starting from any given system of generators ( `` buchberger s algorithm for shuffle operads '' ) .",
    "a part of the operad theory which provides one of the most useful known tools to study homological and homotopical algebra for algebras over the given operad is the koszul duality for operads  @xcite . proving that a given operad is koszul instantly provides a minimal resolution for this operad , gives a description of the homology theory and , in particular , the deformation theory for algebras over that operad etc .",
    "there are a few general methods to prove that an operad is koszul ; one of the simplest and widely applicable methods  @xcite is to show that a given operad has a quadratic grbner basis ( as a shuffle operad ) ; this provides a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition for koszulness of an operad .",
    "if an operad is koszul , it necessarily is _ quadratic _ , that is has weight - homogeneous relations of weight  @xmath4 .",
    "the operads that serve as `` building blocks '' for operads considered throughout the paper are mostly well known : @xmath68 ( commutative associative algebras ) , @xmath69 ( lie algebras ) , @xmath70 ( associative algebras ) , @xmath71 ( leibniz algebras  @xcite ) , @xmath72 ( zinbiel algebras  @xcite ) , @xmath22 ( [ associative ] permutative algebras  @xcite ) , @xmath73 ( nonassociative permutative algebras  @xcite , closely related to `` right - commutative magma ''  @xcite ) .",
    "all these operads are koszul , and have a quadratic grbner basis .      as we said before ,",
    "some of our constructions exist both in a `` geometric '' and a `` linear '' setting , and are related to each other via the homology functor ( which assigns to a topological space @xmath2 the graded cocommutative coalgebra  @xmath3 ) . to make additional structures transfer easily , we use basic concepts of the theory of polynomial functors .",
    "a polynomial functor is a notion that categorifies the notion of a polynomial , and more generally of a formal power series .",
    "polynomial functors provide a useful uniform language to deal with categorical constructions that have `` a polynomial flavour '' , e.g. when computing sums and products in appropriate categories over specified sets indexing summands / factors in a way that keeps track of the intrinsic structure of the indexing sets .    in precise words , a diagram of sets and",
    "set maps @xmath74 gives rise to a polynomial functor @xmath75 defined by the formula @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote , respectively , the right adjoint and the left adjoint of the pullback functor  @xmath79 .",
    "more explicitly , the functor is given by @xmath80 \\longmapsto \\sum_{b\\in b } \\prod_{e\\in p^{-1}(b ) } f^{-1}(s(e)),\\ ] ] where the last set is considered to be over @xmath81 via @xmath82 .",
    "here one can replace @xmath83 by another category where all the appropriate notions make sense . for our purposes",
    ", it is enough to consider the case @xmath84 , in which case the corresponding functors were referred to as polynomial functors in @xcite , and are called polynomial functors in one variable in more recent literature .    for a systematic introduction to polynomial functors ,",
    "we refer the reader to the paper  @xcite and the notes  @xcite that reflect the state - of - art of the theory .",

    "this is not at all surprising , since by combining theorem  [ thm : koszul - dual ] with theorem  [ thm : cacti - koszul ] below we expect that the @xmath20-modules @xmath616 are isomorphic , and that @xmath617 is a suboperad of  @xmath609 .        using the splitting of  @xmath1 along the augmentation",
    ", we can refine the formulae   and   as follows : @xmath620 the formulae  , , and   represent the formula   after splitting , and the formulae   and   represent the formula   after splitting .",
    "it is clear that the formulae   and   describe the operad  @xmath22 , while the formula   describes precisely the operad  @xmath619 .",
    "it remains to show that the formulae   and   define a filtered distributive law between these two operads . to be precise , we first need to check that the formula   stands a chance of defining a distributive law , since _ a priori _ its right hand side is a mixture of all possible tree monomials .",
    "however , we first note that the compatibility of the counit with the coproduct ensures that if @xmath621 then @xmath622 so the tree monomial @xmath623 is missing on the right hand side of  .",
    "also , the tree monomials of the form @xmath624 ( with @xmath625 ) appearing on the right hand side should be rewritten using the formula  , but this minor detail will not affect any of our computations .    to check that the formulae   and define a filtered distributive law between @xmath22 and  @xmath619 , one need to perform carefully all ambiguous rewritings bringing the generator  @xmath412 towards the root of a tree monomial , checking that they do not give additional new relations .",
    "we shall omit the details , indicating briefly that the rewriting of @xmath626 does not result in a new relation because the coproduct of  @xmath1 is cocommutative , while the rewriting of @xmath627 does not result in a new relation because the coproduct of  @xmath1 is coassociative , and finally the rewriting of @xmath628 as well as @xmath629 does not result in new relations because of the nap - type relations .",
    "this , together with the observation that the projection @xmath630 always splits because the relations of @xmath22 remain undeformed ( @xmath547 ) , completes the proof of our theorem .",
    "let @xmath2 be the ( pointed ) two - element set  @xmath456 , so that @xmath454 is the split two - dimensional coalgebra @xmath457 , as in the example  [ ex : perm - nap ] below .",
    "theorem  [ thm : cacti - koszul ] shows that we have an @xmath20-module isomorphism @xmath631 but the operads @xmath387 and  @xmath609 are substantially different .",
    "of course , there is also a trivial operad structure on the @xmath20-module @xmath632 for which the insertion of any @xmath22-operation into any @xmath617-operation is equal to zero ; this operad is koszul and self - dual .",
    "it is an open question whether there exist nontrivial self - dual koszul operad structures on @xmath632 via a distributive law or a filtered distributive law between @xmath22 and @xmath617 ; such operads would be natural candidates to encode `` pre - poisson algebras '' ( much different from the ones in  @xcite ) and `` pre - associative algebras '' .",
