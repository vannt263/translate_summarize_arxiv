    "an unbiased far infrared survey of the spectral line emission from the galaxy has been reported from the cosmic background explorer ( _ cobe _ ) mission by wright  ( 1991 ) and bennett  ( 1994 ) . a new analysis of the firas data provides an improvement of approximately a factor of 2 in signal - to - noise and a more complete map of the sky .",
    "this has enabled improved full sky maps of the 157.7  c  and 205.3  n  cooling lines and additional detections of co lines , and the 115.8  ch line .",
    "the 269  h@xmath9o line was detected in absorption towards the galactic center .    while the primary purpose of the instrument was to make precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the instrument design had many advantages for the study of large scale diffuse emission from our galaxy .",
    "the firas has made absolute measurements of intensity with no beam switching , with a 7@xmath10 beam , and has observed 99% of the sky .",
    "this makes the firas data well - suited for determination of diffuse emission .",
    "the firas spectral resolution is low , as discussed below in  3 , and no spectral lines are resolved . despite this",
    ", the galactic rotation can be discerned using the detected firas spectral lines ( fixsen  1996 ) .    the absolute nature of the firas measurements coupled with the nearly full sky coverage allow observation of the overall galactic energy balance .",
    "however care needs to be taken in comparing the results to measurements taken with a small beam or done with beam switching .",
    "since the firas beam is large , even bright small sources can appear insignificant while large diffuse regions that do nt even appear in beam switched studies dominate .",
    "the first cosmological results from the _ cobe _ firas instrument were reported by mather  ( 1990 ) , and boggess  ( 1992 ) .",
    "more recent results are reported by bennett  ( 1994 ) , fixsen  ( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) , and dwek  ( 1997 ) .",
    "previous results of the _ cobe _ firas unbiased far infrared survey of the milky way were published by wright  ( 1991 ) and bennett  ( 1994 ) .",
    "bennett s figure 2 summarizes spectral line detections from _ cobe _ firas : 157.7  c , 370.4  and 609.1  ci , j=2 - 1 through j=5 - 4 co , and 121.9  and 205.3  n. since then , improved data processing algorithms and techniques have allowed for a more detailed examination of the data .",
    "the c , ci  and co emission lines detected by _ cobe _ are recognized as the expected cooling lines from pdrs ( hollenbach , takahashi , & tielens 1991 ) .",
    "the result that the galactic - averaged pdr properties are described by lower excitation conditions than objects such as orion is reinforced by the weakness of the 145.5  oi  line .",
    "the firas instrument and its calibration were described in detail by fixsen  ( 1994 ) .",
    "significant improvements were noted by fixsen  ( 1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we use the combined ( all detectors and all scan modes ) , destriped data with higher frequency resolution also denoted  pass 4 \" ( firas explanatory supplement ) . the improved calibration , destriping , and larger data set reduce the uncertainties to about half of those of bennett  ( 1994 ) .",
    "data from all of the channels , scan modes , and frequency bands were combined using a weighted average to form a data set with 210 spectral points from 4.4 mm to 104  ( 2.3 to 96.3 @xmath1 ) .",
    "some of these data were used by bennett  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the instrument line response function is described in detail by bennett ( 1994 ) . since the apodization is asymmetric , the resulting line profile is complex . for  pass 4 \"",
    "we padded the 512 point interferograms with an additional 128 points on the short side to include almost all of the information in the real part of the spectrum with a bin width of 0.45 @xmath1 .",
    "continuum and line spectra were fitted to the data as follows .",
    "first , a 2.728 k planck spectrum , @xmath11 was subtracted from the spectrum at each sky pixel . then the spectrum at each pixel was fit with 36 parameters .",
    "the parameters of the fit ( and their corresponding degrees of freedom at each pixel ) were : the amplitudes at each assumed line frequency ( 18 ) , the amplitude of a @xmath12 term to remove the cosmic microwave dipole ( 1 ) , the amplitude of a @xmath13 to remove most of the galactic dust emission ( 1 ) , and coefficients of legendre polynomials for the continuum emission of the dust ( 16 ) .",
    "the fit removes 36 degrees of freedom , leaving 174 degrees of freedom at each of 6063 pixels .",
    "the data were weighted by an inverse variance that is dominated by detector noise , but calculation of the uncertainties include other terms .",
    "the use of this diagonal matrix weighting is an approximation to the full covariance matrix , which is not perfectly diagonal because of the effects of the apodization and the calibration process .",
    "the full covariance matrix was used to compute the uncertainties ( fixsen  1994 ) .",
    "the galactic plane is unresolved by the 7@xmath10 firas beam . from dirbe and other observations",
    "it is seen that for ( 1  @xmath14  ) the galactic radiation is concentrated in a band 1@xmath10 wide . for the galactic plane we use the firas data before they are binned into pixels .",
    "we form bins of 5@xmath10 galactic longitude and 1@xmath10 galactic latitude centered on the galactic plane . with the assumption that the observations near the galactic plane are dominated by the radiation from a region 1@xmath10 across at the galactic plane ,",
    "the spectrum for each bin is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the weight of the @xmath17 data in the bin , @xmath18 is the beam response to a line source at the galactic plane and @xmath19 is the @xmath17 spectrum .",
    "the beam response is derived from observations near the moon , which are not otherwise used .",
    "the beam response is used to derive @xmath20 , which is normalized to a 1@xmath10 wide unit line source .",
    "this has two important effects .",
    "first we increase the signal to noise ratio in the result as we weight the data in proportion to the signal .",
    "second the amplitude is increased by a factor of @xmath21 over the presentation in bennett  ( 1994 ) .",
    "this is because bennett  give an average over @xmath22 while we give the result for @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 we use the pixels from fixsen ( 1996 ) .    for each pixel",
    "we perform a simultaneous least squares fit of a continuum spectral baseline plus a series of spectral line profiles centered on the wavelengths of known lines .",
    "the result is a set of spectral line intensities for each pixel .",
    "we find that while the c  emission ( figure 1 , top ) follows the continuum closely , and the n  emission ( figure 1 , bottom ) follows it approximately , the co and other emissions have distinct distributions .",
    "the j=1 - 0 , 6 - 5 , 7 - 6 and 8 - 7 co lines are detected , as well as the co j=2 - 1 , 3 - 2 , 4 - 3 and 5 - 4 transitions noted by bennett  ( 1994 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows co emission from the central galactic region .",
    "the 7 - 6 transition appears but the 370.4  ci  and the 369  7 - 6 co transitions are too close to be resolved by the firas .",
    "some care must be exercised to interpret figure 3 g .",
    "this is probably a mixture of the 7 - 6 co transition and the ci  emission .",
    "bally  ( 1988 ) found that in the galactic center region the low lying rotational co lines are optically very thick .",
    "so , the line emission should be proportional to @xmath25 , where the extra factor of @xmath26 is because the same velocity dispersion leads to higher bandwidth at higher frequencies . with this model ,",
    "the full co spectrum can be reasonably approximated by a 40 k temperature ( figure 2a ) .",
    "a simple explanation is a temperature distribution with a peak at 40  k. we use this model to estimate the emission due to co 7 - 6 and assign the remaining emission to the 370.4  ci .",
    "there are small regions exhibiting much higher temperatures ( simpson   1997 , jackson  1996 ) .",
    "we see only a hint in these data in the form of the high co 8 - 7 transition and the uncertainties do not justify a more complex model for the large area - averaged data",
    ". the larger uncertainties at higher frequencies allow only upper limits of 10 and 15  nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 respectively for the co 9 - 8 and co 10 - 9 lines .",
    "these results are in broad agreement with paglione  ( 1998 ) who concluded 80% of the gas is 40 k and below .",
    "since the co is optically thick significant high temperature regions could be hidden from the firas instrument .",
    "there is also a smaller but significant amount of co emission in the plane at longitudes @xmath27 .",
    "again we use the thick optical model of co to fit to a 22 k spectrum ( figure 2b ) , estimate the emission due to co 7 - 6 and assign the remaining emission to the 370.4  ci .",
    "these are used in the table .    over most of figure 2",
    "g the signal to noise is too low to estimate the co temperature . instead the co 7 - 6 emission",
    "is approximated as the average of the co 8 - 7 , co 6 - 5 and co 5 - 4 emission .",
    "the resulting ci  ( figure 5c ) shows a similar intensity and structure to the 609.1 ci  emission .",
    "the ground state @xmath28 269  transition of para - h@xmath9o is detected .",
    "the longitude profile of this water transition , shown in figure 4a , displays an absorption dip towards the galactic center , as do bennett  ( 1994 ) . with the improved signal to noise ratio",
    "we can now detect this line at the @xmath29 level .",
    "the error bars on the line intensity are larger near the galactic center because of uncertainty in the ability to calibrate and remove the larger continuum emission there . as shown by bennett  ( 1994 )",
    "the water absorption should be expected .    in figure 4c",
    "we examine the ratio of the 269  para - h@xmath9o line to the continuum .",
    "the change in the ratio shows that this is a true absorption and not an artifact of the calibration . beyond the central galactic region ( @xmath30 )",
    "the signal is so small that it is swamped by the noise .      as oxygen",
    "is the third most abundant element , molecular oxygen might be expected in a wide variety of conditions ( viala & walmsley 1996 ) .",
    "measuring it would help to unravel the many reactions involving oxygen .",
    "searching for it is difficult because of the oxygen in the atmosphere .",
    "the ( @xmath31 ) transition of o@xmath9 at 705.8  ( figure 4e ) is predicted by marechal ( 1997 ) to be among the strongest o@xmath9 lines . the intensity could be up to 10 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 for thick clouds .",
    "the line was not detected by _",
    "firas , and we place a limit ( 95% cl ) on its intensity towards the galactic center of 1 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8",
    ". there is 1 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 of o@xmath9 in a ring ( @xmath32 ) but this is only a @xmath33 effect and we do not claim a detection , but only an upper limit of 3 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 .",
    "the 145.5  oi  ( figure 4f ) is detected but it is strongest in the spiral arms rather than the galactic center .",
    "the 115.8  ch ( figure 4h ) line has been detected , although the firas noise is high . a weighted average using the 205.3  n  intensity as a template improves the signal / noise ratio to show the detection of the 115.8  ch line at the @xmath34 level . using the same method",
    ", the 129.7  sii  line shows a @xmath35 effect ( figure 4 g ) , but we can not claim a detection and we place an upper limit ( 95% cl ) of 250 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 towards the galactic center . none of these lines are evident out of the galactic plane .",
    "liu  ( 1997 ) made a careful search for ch lines in the planetary nebula ngc 7027 .",
    "they report detections of the rotational lines @xmath36f@xmath37 at 149.2  ( 4.6 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 ) , the @xmath36f@xmath38 lines at 180.7  ( 3.7 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 ) and the @xmath39f@xmath38 lines at 115.8  ( 2.2 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 ) .",
    "they also report an upper limit of 1 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 on the @xmath36f@xmath40 lines at 118.6 .",
    "the intensities given here are the mean intensities for the 70 arc second beam of the _ iso _ long wavelength spectrometer .",
    "most of the radiation originates from a region @xmath41 arc seconds across ( middlemass 1990 ) , which implies an intensity of 440 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 for the central region .",
    "the intensity we observe towards the galactic center region ( that is the region weighted by the n ) is @xmath42 nw  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 .",
    "liu  ( 1996 ) observe the 157.7  c   to 115.8  ch ratio to be about 150 .",
    "the ratio we observe using the same selection for c  as for the ch is about 300 .",
    "the uncertainties are large so the difference may be insignificant or the mean inner galaxy may have a higher c  to ch ratio than ngc 7027 .",
    "the first excited rotational level of ch has a critical density of @xmath43 @xmath5 and the next level has a critical density of @xmath44 @xmath5 ( phelps & dalby 1966 ) .",
    "although we do not see the 149.2  lines they are in the wings of the very strong 157.7  c   line and the upper limit would allow the same ratio as observed by liu ( 1997 ) .",
    "evidently at least part of the radiation emanates from fairly dense regions .",
    "the 157.7  c  line is clearly the dominant line in this entire band .",
    "examination of the intensity along the galactic plane ( figure 5a ) shows the peak of the c  line is not in the galactic center but in the molecular ring at @xmath45 .",
    "other peaks are evident at @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , with the inner peaks more evident for @xmath48 and the outer peaks more evident for @xmath49 , clearly demonstrating the spiral structure of the galaxy .",
    "the c  to continuum ratio is fairly constant both along the galactic plane and out of the plane with c  enhancements of a factor of 2 or 3 in the spiral arms ( figure 5c ) .",
    "the 609.1  ci  ( figure 5b ) is almost entirely confined to the inner galactic region , with a clear peak at the galactic center and shoulders out to the molecular ring , unlike the c  which has a dip in the galactic center .",
    "the 370.4  ci  line can not be separated from the 269  co 7 - 6 transition , with the firas resolution .",
    "we model the co 7 - 6 emission as the average of the co 8 - 7 , co 6 - 5 and co 5 - 4 emission .",
    "the resulting ci  ( figure 5c ) shows a similar intensity and structure to the 609.1  ci  emission .",
    "[ [ n ] ] n ~    the 205.3  n  line is strong enough to form a reasonable full sky map from the firas data ( figure 1 bottom ) .",
    "it has a similar structure to the c   ( figure 5e ) although it is more strongly concentrated in the galactic center .",
    "the n / c  ratio plotted as a function of galactic longitude ( figure 5h ) shows a smooth function with a peak at the galactic center .",
    "rudolph  ( 1997 ) give an n / s abundance ratio variation as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the radius in kpc .",
    "they note that the s / o ratio is constant as expected . assuming the s / c ratio is constant , we derive the dashed line in figure 5h for radiation dominated by the inner edge , or the dotted line for uniform sources .    the 121.9  n  line ( figure 5f ) has a structure and magnitude similar to the 205.3  n  line emission .",
    "the higher noise of the firas at this frequency prevents a detailed comparison but to first order it appears that the 121.9  n  line emission can be modeled as proportional to the 205.3  n  line emission .",
    "the mean of the @xmath52(121.9  n ) /@xmath52(205.3",

    "only there is the co 1 - 0 detectable .",
    "the co line ratios suggest a temperature of 40  k ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we attempt to fit the observed line strengths of co 1 - 0 thru co 8 - 7 , the ci  lines and the c  line by adjusting the density , uv flux and an overall gain to the the pdr model of hollenbach   the best fit is @xmath111@xmath1 and @xmath112w  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 ( 10 habing units ) .",
    "the fit is only weakly dependent on the density , allowing a factor of 5 in either direction .",
    "the data constrain the uv flux much better , allowing only a factor of 2 in @xmath113 .",
    "the fit is poor ( @xmath114dof=58 ) with the major problem being the observed c  line intensity which is a factor of 3 higher than the model .",
    "this might be due to foreground or background emission from the molecular ring .",
    "thus we can make the model agree with the ratios if we assume a density of @xmath115  @xmath5 and a uv density of @xmath112w  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 and that much of the observed c  flux at the galactic center is really from the molecular ring .",
    "the density is in agreement with the bally  ( 1988 ) average density estimate of 50 @xmath1 over the region @xmath116  pc , @xmath117  pc , which is approximately the same as our galactic center region .",
    "the values we obtained for @xmath113 and @xmath118 are lower than other observers ( simpson  1997 ) have found in the galactic center .",
    "they used much smaller beamwidths and were sensitive to compact objects , while our beamwidth of 7@xmath10 corresponds to a region 1 kpc across .",
    "our numbers are also small compared to those we found for the inner galaxy region defined below .",
    "we conclude that the high brightness of the galactic center is due to relatively low density material filling a relatively large fraction of available space , rather than compact objects around young stars .",
    "a second distinct region is the inner galaxy , roughly the galactic plane with @xmath119 .",
    "this region has much smaller co emission even though it has more ci  emission .",
    "the co emission is consistent with an optically thick temperature of 22  k , considerably cooler than the galactic center .",
    "fitting the pdr model to the data yields @xmath120  @xmath5 and @xmath121w  m@xmath7  sr@xmath8 .",
    "even so there is a factor of 2 more c  emission observed than the model prediction .",
    "this suggests that in the inner galactic regions the lines emission is from dense clouds with high uv flux , and that the c  emission is more efficient than in the one dimensional pdr model .",
    "this could be a simple surface to volume ratio effect .",
    "the outer galactic plane presumably should also be similar to local conditions averaged over a sufficiently large volume .",
    "this region has approximately the same line ratios as the inner galaxy suggesting the conditions are much the same on average although the average emission is a factor of 5 lower than the inner galaxy .",
    "the one exception is that the n  to c  ratio is lower .",
    "this can be explained by a generally lower n abundance in the outer galaxy ( rudolph 1997 ) .",
    "the high latitude emission is much weaker than the emission in the outer galactic plane .",
    "the simple picture of a thin disk ( @xmath122 ) gives just this effect with the same line ratios as observed in the outer galaxy .",
    "thus description holds although the signal / noise ratios for most of the lines are too small to make a strong statement .",
