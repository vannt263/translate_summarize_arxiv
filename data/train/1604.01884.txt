    "quasars are useful background sources when investigating objects along our lines of sight .",
    "the absorption features in quasar spectra ( i.e. , quasar absorption lines ; qals ) are usually classified into _ intervening _ qals , which originate in intervening galaxies and the intergalactic medium , and _ intrinsic _ qals , whose origin is physically associated to the background quasars . the latter comprise the accelerated gas outflow from the quasars themselves .",
    "the gas outflow can be accelerated by several possible mechanisms : radiation pressure in the lines and continuum @xcite , magnetocentrifugal force @xcite , and thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "however , the primary mechanism of the gas outflow is poorly understood .",
    "the outflow winds are important because ( 1 ) they eject angular momentum from the quasar accretion disk and promote accretion of new gas @xcite , ( 2 ) they expel large amounts of energy and metallicity , thus contributing to the chemical evolution of the local universe , and ( 3 ) they regulate star formation in nearby interstellar and intergalactic regions .",
    "broad absorption lines ( bals ) , defined as lines with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) exceeding 2,000  km s@xmath5 @xcite , have been routinely used in outflow wind studies .",
    "however , the line parameters ( e.g. , column density and line width ) of bals can not be measured by model fitting because the line profiles are hopelessly blended and saturated . on the other hand , mini - bals ( with fwhms of 500  2,000 km s@xmath5 ) and",
    "narrow absorption lines ( nals ; with fwhms @xmath6 500  km s@xmath5 ) contain internal structures that can be model - fitted to probe their properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the observed bals , mini - bals , or nals depend on the viewing angle to the outflow stream @xcite .",
    "the detection rates of bals , mini - bals , and nals are @xmath110 - 15% , @xmath15% , and @xmath150% , respectively ( @xcite ) , which probably indicate the global covering fraction of the absorbers around the continuum sources .    around 70 ",
    "90%  of bals are time - variable within 10 years @xcite . as an extreme case ,",
    "the measured c@xmath7 bal variability of sdssj141007.74 + 541203.3 is only 1.20 days in the quasar rest - frame @xcite representing the shortest timescale of absorption line variability ever reported .",
    "recently , @xcite monitored the spectra of mini - bal and nal quasars , and found that only the former shows significant time variability in its absorption lines .",
    "however , the physical mechanisms of the absorption line variability remain unclear . to date , three scenarios have been proposed : ( 1 ) gas clouds crossing our line of sight ( the gas motion scenario ) , ( 2 ) variable attenuation by flux that is redirected toward our line of sight by scattering material around the quasar ( the reflection scenario ) , and ( 3 ) changing ionization levels in the outflow gas ( the variable ionization state ( vis ) scenario ) .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically monitored the c@xmath7 mini - bal in the quasar hs  1603 + 3820 for more than four years .",
    "they found multiple troughs in the mini - bal that vary in concert .",
    "this finding eliminates the gas motion scenario ( at least in 1603 + 3820 ) because it implies simultaneous crossing of gas clouds over our line of sight , which is unlikely .",
    "@xcite also rejected the reflection scenario , because in spectropolarimetric observations of the same mini - bal system , the fraction of polarized flux ( i.e. , the flux redirected by scattering material ) is only @xmath10.6  % , too small to support the reflection scenario .",
    "@xcite found no correlations between quasars and absorption lines variability in 13 bal quasars . on the other hand , simultaneously monitored the equivalent widths ( ews ) of bals and the ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosities of their host quasars ( i.e. , ionizing photon density ) and found clear correlations in a single quasar , supporting the vis scenario .",
    "the vis scenario has not been tested in mini - bal / nal quasars and is still being debated .    in this study",
    ", we verify the vis scenario in the light curves of four mini - bal quasars and five nal quasars ( hereafter , quasar variability ) .",
    "we also search for possible correlations between the outflow and quasar parameters , as discussed in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ( g99 , hereafter ) ; @xcite ( vb04 , hereafter ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ( w08 , hereafter ) ; ) .",

    "the log excludes q0450 - 1310 and q1946 + 7658 in the @xmath2-band because the continuum fluxes of these quasars are heavily absorbed by the foreground intergalactic medium ( i.e. , ly@xmath15 forest ) .",

    "since we mainly investigate the light curves of quasars ( i.e. , the _ relative _ magnitudes between observing epochs ) , we do not need to measure their _ true _ magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we performed relative photometry by simultaneously monitoring the quasars and _ effective _ photometric standard stars ( hereafter called _ comparison stars _ ) near the quasars .",
    "the comparison stars were selected as follows .",

    "a single comparison star was used in all epochs , unless different stars in different filters were required .",
    "the quasars were subjected to relative photometry against these comparison stars and were classified as variable stars if their magnitude changed by more than 3@xmath24 and 0.05 mag .",

    "however , the @xmath105 variability developed over a shorter time  -  frame in q1700 + 6416 than in hs1603 + 3820 , which might explain the larger color variability gradient in the former than in the latter .",
    "as shown in figure  5 , the variability trends of the magnitude and ew of the c@xmath7 mini - bal for hs1603 + 3820 were marginally synchronized with the quasar variability leading the ew variability . specifically , the ew first increased from 2012 september ( epoch 1 ) to 2015 february ( epoch 3 ) with a marginal significance level of @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) and then decreased from 2015 february to 2015 may ( epoch 4 ) , while the quasar brightness in the @xmath2-band first decreased from 2012 september to 2014 may and then increased from 2014 may to 2015 may .",
    "the time - lag of the marginal synchronizing trend in quasar and absorption line variabilities is about nine months ( @xmath12.6 months in the quasar rest - frame ) .",
    "if we assume the time - delay corresponds to the recombination time from c@xmath108 to c@xmath7 , we can place a lower limit on the absorber s gas density as @xmath109 @xmath110 by the same prescription as used in @xcite .    reported a similar synchronizing trend in a bal quasar apm 08279 + 5255 , although one of two nals that are detected aside the bal did not show such a synchronization .",
    "they suggested this was due to a larger recombination time for the nal absorber with smaller electron density compared to the other absorbers .",
    "both of these results are not inconsistent to the vis scenario .      assuming the vis scenario , we now estimate the quasar variability that reproduces the observed absorption line variabilities of bal and mini - bal quasars reported in literature .",
    "if the vis scenario holds , the absorption strengths will depend on the ionization condition of the absorber , which is quantified by the ionization parameter @xmath111    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the number density of hydrogen - ionizing photons emitted from the continuum source per second , @xmath114 is the distance between the absorber and the continuum source , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the volume densities of the ionizing photons and electrons , respectively .    here , we assume the absorption line variability of ( mini-)bals is attributed to recombination to ( or ionization from ) c@xmath117 ( _ case a _ , hereafter ) and adopt the optimal ionization parameters for c@xmath117 and c@xmath118 ( @xmath119u @xmath1 @xmath122.8 and @xmath122.0 , respectively ) @xcite . because at least one of our mini - bal quasars ( hs1603 + 3820 ) is unlikely to vary by the gas motion scenario @xcite ,",
    "we assume constant gas density @xmath116 . therefore , the ionizing photon density @xmath115 should increase / decrease by a factor of @xmath16.3 to change @xmath120 from / to @xmath122.8 to / from @xmath122.0 , corresponding to @xmath17 @xmath1 2 . for reference , a typical quasar varies by only @xmath17 @xmath1 0.1 over several months and maximally varies by @xmath17 @xmath1 0.5 over several years @xcite .",
    "these variabilities are much smaller than the above - required value .",
    "however , c@xmath7 absorbers do not necessarily have an optimal ionization parameter for c@xmath118 ( i.e. , @xmath119u @xmath1 @xmath122.0 ) .",
    "as the other extreme case , if mini - bal absorbers have @xmath119u @xmath1 @xmath123.0 , their ionization fraction @xmath121 ( i.e. , a fraction of carbon in ion state c@xmath118 ) is very sensitive to the ionization parameter ( @xmath122f/@xmath122u @xmath1 1.8 ; _ case b _ , hereafter ) , although it weakly depends on the shape of incident ionizing flux . indeed , the value of @xmath122f/@xmath122u for hs1603 + 3820 , which is the only quasar among our sample for which the magnitude and ew of the c@xmath7 mini - bal were simultaneously monitored over three years , is @xmath11.1 between epochs 1 and 2 ( @xmath122ew @xmath123 0.1 ) and @xmath12.0 between the epochs 1 and 3 ( @xmath122ew @xmath1 0.18 ) , assuming @xmath17 @xmath10.23 ( the maximum quasar variability during our monitoring observations ) .",
    "these values are expected for absorbers with ionization parameters of @xmath119u @xmath1 @xmath124 ",
    "@xmath125 ( see figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , an averaged amplitude of absorption variability in four c@xmath7 mini - bals in our sample ( @xmath126ew@xmath127 @xmath1 @xmath126f@xmath127 @xmath1 0.1 ) can be caused by only a small change of the ionizing flux , @xmath119u @xmath1 0.06 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath17 @xmath1 0.14 , comparable to a typical variability of our sample quasars as well as quasars in the literature @xcite .",
    "the variability amplitude of c@xmath7 ionizing photons in shorter wavelength ( @xmath128 @xmath1 200 @xmath129 ) may be even larger because of the anti - correlation between quasar variability and wavelength ( see section 3.3 ) .",
    "thus , the case  b is favorable for explaining the variability trend in hs1603 + 3820 with the vis scenario .",
    "however , it has one shortcoming ; four mini - bal systems in our sample have either strong n@xmath108 absorption lines or no remarkable si@xmath7 absorption lines , which suggests their ionization condition is not as low as @xmath119u @xmath1 @xmath124 ( see figure  2 of @xcite ) . therefore , it is less likely that the case  b alone causes the absorption variability of mini - bals in our sample quasars .",
    "the outflow wind variability may be caused by more than one mechanism .",
    "we speculate that the vis scenario is accompanied by an additional mechanism , such as variable optical depth between the flux source and the absorber .",
    "one promising candidates is a @xmath130 which has been frequently detected in x - ray spectroscopy ( e.g.,@xcite , 2006 ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "warm absorbers were originally proposed to avoid over - ionization of the outflow winds @xcite . because warm absorbers are significantly variable in x - ray monitoring observations ( e.g. , @xcite",
    "; @xcite , b ) , the ionization condition of the uv absorber in the downstream might also vary .",
    "indeed , in a photoionization model , @xcite estimated that the c@xmath7 mini - bal absorber lies within @xmath114 = 0.1  pc of the quasar center .",
    "similarly , the x - ray warm absorber is estimated to be within 0.1 pc of hs1603 + 3820 .",
    "@xcite argued that nal and bal absorbers locate at high and low latitudes above the accretion disk equator , respectively .",
    "a radiation - mhd simulation by @xcite also predicts no warm absorbers at very high latitudes .",
    "if this picture is correct , x - ray shielding is ineffective in the nal outflow directions .",
    "supporting this idea , x - rays are not strongly absorbed in nal quasars @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite supports that nal absorbers are the interstellar media of host galaxies , which are swept up by the outflow wind . in this case",
    ", the absorbers should exhibit little variability because their volume density is very small ( corresponding to a very long recombination time ) .",
    "moreover , they are very distant ( of the order of kpcs ) from the continuum source , therefore they should be weakly influenced by the variable flux source .",
    "however , @xcite find no evidence of strong x - ray absorption toward the outflows of either nal or mini - bal quasars . instead of an x - ray warm absorber",
    ", they argue that small dense clumpy absorbers avoid over - ionization by self - shielding . in this case",
    ", we should expect no correlations between the absorption strengths of the uv and x - ray fluxes .",
    "we performed i ) photometric monitoring observations of four mini - bal and five nal quasars over more than three years and ii ) spectroscopic observation for a single mini - bal quasar ( hs1603 + 3820 ) to investigate whether the vis scenario can explain the absorption line variability in bals and mini - bals .",
    "our main results are summarized below :    * quasar variability increases with monitoring time - lag but decreases with observed wavelength , as previously reported in normal quasars . * mini - bal and nal quasars become bluer as they brightened ( the bwb trend ) , as often observed in normal quasars .",
    "* the quasar variability properties did not significantly differ between mini - bal and nal quasars , indicating that flux and color variabilities alone can not account for the absorption line variabilities . *",
    "quasar magnitude was marginally synchronized with absorption strengths in one mini - bal quasar hs1603 + 3820 , with the former temporally leading the latter .",
    "* the vis scenario can not causes the absorption variability of mini - bals in our sample quasars unless the ionization condition of outflow gas is as low as @xmath119u @xmath1 @xmath123 .",
    "* the vis scenario may require an additional mechanism that regulates incident flux to the outflow gas .",
    "the most promising candidate is x - ray warm absorbers with variable optical depth .    before conclusively validating the vis scenario , we need to simultaneously monitor the outflow and shielding material by uv and x - ray spectroscopies .",
    "the presented monitoring observations should also be performed on quasars with a wide range of luminosities and eddington ratios to mask the anti - correlation effect between the luminosity / eddington ratio and quasar variability .",

    "<S> our main results are as follows : ( 1 ) structure function ( sf ) analysis revealed that the quasar uv flux variability over three years was not large enough to support the vis scenario , unless the ionization condition of outflow gas is very low . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) there was no crucial difference between the sfs of mini - bal and nal quasars . ( 3 ) the variability of the mini - bal and quasar light curves was weakly synchronized with a small time delay for hs1603 + 3820 . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the vis scenario may need additional mechanisms such as a variable shielding by x - ray warm absorbers . </S>"
