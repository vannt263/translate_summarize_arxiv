    "supermassive black hole ( bh ) binaries are formed as a result of galactic mergers .",
    "the two bhs sink towards the bottom of the potential well and form a bound pair at the centre of the stellar distribution .",
    "according to the classical picture @xcite the binary hardens until the loss cone is depleted ( i.e. depleted of stars on low angular momentum orbits that pass close enough to the binary for a significant interaction ) , and stalls at a separation too large for the emission of gravitational radiation to cause rapid inspiral and coalescence ( the ` final parsec problem ' ) .",
    "this picture has been tested extensively using @xmath0-body simulations and scattering experiments .",
    "early numerical studies concentrated on the simple case of an equal mass binary on a circular orbit within a spherically symmetric stellar distribution .",
    "those studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with a relatively small number of particles , were somewhat inconsistent with each other and could not confirm loss cone depletion due to spurious numerical relaxation over long time scales .    in recent years",
    ", more detailed investigations have been performed .",
    "apart from the increased number of particles and longer integration times , various complications have been considered such as triaxiality and rotation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , post newtonian corrections ( e.g. @xcite ) massive perturbers ( e.g. @xcite ) and gas discs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these studies found that binary coalescence in less than the hubble time is feasible even if only one of these factors is present .",
    "thus , the final parsec is potentially not a problem in a realistic merger remnant .",
    "more recent work ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) has focused on the evolution of the binary eccentricity rather than just the binary separation . for high mass ratios ( @xmath1 100:1 ) , these authors showed that even in a spherically symmetric environment , eccentricity can increase to almost unity .",
    "very high eccentricity means that in pericentre the two bhs can be close enough together that gravitational wave emission becomes efficient .",
    "this enhanced energy loss to gravitational radiation ( as compared to the circular case with the same semi - major axis ) can reduce coalescence timescale to well below the hubble time .",
    "direct @xmath0-body simulations are the most accurate way to study binary bh ( bbh ) evolution , but they are computationally expensive .",
    "it is therefore difficult to perform diverse enough tests to cover the problem s parameter space . by compromising for an unrealistically small number of particles , one introduces spurious relaxation . in spherical galaxies ,",
    "this process drives unrealistic loss cone repopulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and causes the hardening rate to be highly @xmath0-dependent ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite followed the evolution of a bbh in triaxial and rotating galaxy models and found that the hardening rate was @xmath0-independent , implying a collisionless mode of loss cone repopulation .",
    "our previous work dealt with a possible stellar kinematical signature of stars around a bbh .",
    "in @xcite we produced kinematical maps ( projected maps of mean stellar velocity , velocity dispersion and higher velocity moments ) ; this was achieved by scattering stars on a bbh on a fixed circular orbit .",
    "to produce more realistic kinematical maps , we looked for a way to calculate a bbh path fast and accurately so it could be used for following scattering experiments .",
    "good kinematical maps require a very large number ( @xmath2 ) of stars on small scales , otherwise the high moments of the line of sight velocity distribution are poorly resolved .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations can not be made yet with such a large number of particles on small enough scales , but this is not a problem for scattering experiments which are performed on a precalculated bbh path . since we were already working with scattering experiments , we derived a way to use the existing code base and adapt it to work more like an actual @xmath0-body simulation , where the effect of scatterings on the bbh orbit is taken into account , giving the orbital evolution .",
    "in this paper we present a new scheme we developed to simulate the inspiral of the bbh from the galactic scale to the hard binary scale .",
    "our method is based on imposing conservation of total energy and angular momentum , instead of directly summing the forces of individual stars on the bhs , and lies between scattering experiments and @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "studying this type of systems with scattering experiments is significantly faster than a full @xmath0-body treatment and is appropriate when the bulge has relaxed .",
    "the phase space stellar distribution is followed accurately and a more realistic number of stars can be included .",
    "thus , we are able to run many simulations and probe a large range of parameters under reasonable physical assumptions , as well as the convergence of the solution , and compare the inspiral timescale , the stalling radius , and the eccentricity evolution to earlier calculations . since in our method we obtain the forces on the bhs , it is also possible to test analytical expressions for dynamical friction .",
    "the original treatment by @xcite is for a homogeneous background , therefore we compare our results to @xcite who investigate dynamical friction in power law cusps .",
    "our solution extends beyond the range of validity of their formula and into the hard binary regime of the bhs .",
    "we studied the evolution of both an equal mass binary and a 10:1 mass ratio binary under different initial conditions .",
    "we found that both cases presented stalling of the semi - major axis , but in the unequal mass case , eccentricity tended to grow towards unity on timescales well below the hubble time .",
    "in section [ sec : math ] we give a general mathematical formulation of our simulation scheme .",
    "the model for the specific simulations we performed in this work is described in section [ sec : model ] while a technical description of the scheme appears in section [ sec : algorithm ] . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results of all bbh simulations and discuss their physical implication . in section [ sec : df ] we discuss dynamical friction , compare to earlier results , and show that our code is applicable in very large radii , thus potentially helpful in future studies of phenomena related to dynamical friction .",
    "finally , we give a short summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the two basic ideas of our solution are the separation of timescales and the balance of energy and angular momentum between the bhs and the stars .",
    "there are three timescales in the system corresponding to changes in :    1 .",
    "stellar orbits following close encounters 2 .",
    "the bhs orbits 3 .",
    "the background stellar potential    in more detail : a star significantly changes its original orbit during a close encounter with a bh , but the bh s path is only slightly perturbed as the force exerted on it is due to many small ` scattering ' events ; the change of the background stellar potential is due to the collective response of stars to the perturbation , which evolves on the dynamical timescale .",
    "a yet longer timescale would be of 2-body relaxation , which is longer by a factor of @xmath3 @xcite and is expected to be well above the hubble time for a real galaxy core . however , relaxation time is potentially significantly shorter if the dominant relaxation mode is not 2-body relaxation .",
    "the most basic kind of an @xmath0-body simulation uses very small steps , after each the vector forces exerted by all the field stars ( particles ) are summed up and applied to the bhs in the next step ; each particle is propagated the same way . energy and angular momentum are globally conserved ( within a given numerical error tolerance ) since it is a closed system .",
    "if @xmath0 is not large enough , noisy potential and unrealistically massive stars lead to spurious relaxation .",
    "if the time step is too large , close encounters can not be resolved .",
    "our scheme uses a ` large ' @xmath4 , which we call an _ interval _ , within which there is one or more actual _ steps _ of the ode solver .",
    "let bh number @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) propagate one interval between times @xmath7 and @xmath8 from some vector position @xmath9 to @xmath10 ; we use the term _ segment _ for the path length .",
    "after each interval , the energies and angular momenta of all the particles are summed up . if no work was done and no torque exerted due to the background stellar potential , then the energy @xmath11 ( angular momentum @xmath12 ) gained by the stars during some interval must be equal and opposite to the energy @xmath13 ( angular momentum @xmath14 ) lost to the bhs during this interval . for simplicity",
    ", we use a static and spherically symmetric model for the stellar potential , so these requirements are automatically fulfilled .",
    "the scheme can accommodate more complicated models as well : the demand for spherical ( or more generally , axial ) symmetry , which is necessary if one assumes that change of a star s angular momentum is only due to interaction with the bhs , can be relaxed if the torque component due to the stellar bulge is considered separately ; a slowly varying potential can also be taken into account if the proper adjustments are made to the code .",
    "the evolution of a bbh is dominated by close and fast encounters with the field stars and the evolution of the stellar gravity field is only a secular effect .",
    "thus , the part of @xmath11 due only to the change in stellar potential is negligible after each interval , justifying the use of a static model .",
    "however , at late times , the initial stellar potential is no longer consistent with the actual spatial distribution .",
    "the static potential assumption is still reasonable as far as the bhs are concerned , since by the time that any significant evolution of the background potential has taken place , the bhs will have fallen deep enough in the potential well , where the dominant force is the other bh s gravity rather than the background stellar potential ( so that the exact shape of the potential well does not matter ) .",
    "stars further out orbit in a ` wrong ' potential , but as long as approximate spherical symmetry is preserved , their interaction rate with the bhs should not be significantly influenced by this ( and during a close encounter , the background stellar potential is of course unimportant ) .",
    "assuming additionally that the interval is short enough so that the forces on the bhs due to the background stars do not vary significantly , we perform scattering experiments in each interval to find @xmath11 and @xmath12 . using the simple algebra described below , we find the average forces on the bhs over this interval .",
    "we also assume a purely planar motion of the bhs . thus , unless stated otherwise , by ` angular momentum ' and ` torque ' we mean only the @xmath15 component of these vectors .",
    "the basic conservation equations are @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the force and torque , respectively , exerted on bh number @xmath5 by the stellar population .",
    "let us write @xmath17 in the following form : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the unit vectors parallel and perpendicular to the velocity of the bh .",
    "note that @xmath22 is ` drag like ' and directed opposite to the velocity vector .",
    "if an object moves through a uniform background , symmetry dictates that the mean force would be antiparallel to the velocity vector .",
    "however in realistic environments there must be also a force due to the inhomogeneities of the background , so a perpendicular force component is required . in cartesian",
    "coordinates : @xmath23 to simplify equation ( [ eq : cons - e ] ) we write @xmath24 and thus @xmath25 the perpendicular force component @xmath26 disappears due to the dot product , while @xmath22 is assumed constant along the path and can be taken out of the integral , which defines @xmath27 ( which is simply the path s length ) . finally , equation (",
    "[ eq : cons - e ] ) for the energy becomes @xmath28    to simplify equation ( [ eq : cons - l ] ) we write @xmath29 in cartesian coordinates : @xmath30 and",
    "thus @xmath31 the above integrals define @xmath32 and @xmath33 . equation ( [ eq : cons - l ] ) for the angular momentum becomes @xmath34    if we evolve the bhs between @xmath7 and @xmath35 under their mutual gravity alone , energy ( and angular momentum ) will be conserved along the produced orbital segment : @xmath36 .",
    "stars scattered on this orbital segment will not their conserve energy : @xmath37 ; so energy is also globally not conserved between @xmath7 and @xmath35 . by solving equations ( [ eq : forces - e ] ) and ( [ eq : forces - l ] ) for the ( non conserving ) forces , the bhs can be evolved again in this time interval , under the additional forces , producing an orbital segment for which @xmath38 .",
    "the revised orbital segment is only slightly different from the original , since the additional forces are much smaller than the forces exerted by the other bh and the background potential .",
    "stars scattered on the revised orbit will have a slightly different @xmath11 .",
    "this process of alternatingly evolving the bhs and the scattering of stars can be repeated until converges is achieved .    since @xmath11 and @xmath12 are directly obtained from the scattering experiments and the six integrals ( calligraphic letters ) are calculated from the orbital segments , equations ( [ eq : forces - e ] ) and ( [ eq : forces - l ] )",
    "are a linear system of two equations with four variables : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is worth noting that without the perpendicular force , which is expected to be negligible in the standard dynamical friction formalism , it is impossible to conserve energy and angular momentum simultaneously .",
    "in particular cases , additional constraints give an exact solution as explained in the following section .        in this case , the masses are equal and the initial conditions are symmetric with respect to the centre of the system . the motion of one bh mirrors that of its companion , so that the path integrals are equal for the two bhs ( the index is therefore dropped ) and the forces acting on them must also be equal due to symmetry .",
    "the solution is @xmath43 there is no solution for @xmath44 ( but @xmath45 is guaranteed by equation [ eq : def - s ] ) . in points where the bhs velocity is purely tangential , @xmath46 is parallel to the radius vector and thus exerts no torque ( and work is never done by @xmath46 ) . at these points ,",
    "@xmath46 is free but @xmath47 is overdetermined ( must change both @xmath48 and @xmath49 by the specified amounts ) . segments which are symmetric about such points have @xmath44 .      in this case",
    "one mass is much larger that the other , and is assumed to sit motionless at the centre of the system .",
    "the forces @xmath22 and @xmath26 act on the secondary bh only .",
    "the integrals @xmath27 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are also calculated for the secondary only .",
    "the solution for @xmath50 is @xmath51      the results for the limiting cases described above motivate us to look for solutions of the form @xmath52 there is a mathematical solution for every @xmath53 , but we know from the limiting cases that @xmath54 .",
    "the value of @xmath53 is a function of the mass ratio @xmath55 , but it may also be dependent on other factors , such as the local stellar densities at the instantaneous position of either bh . in the case of a high mass ratio ,",
    "one bh is almost stationary ; therefore @xmath53 must approach zero faster or at least as fast as @xmath56 .",
    "the force @xmath57 does not have to approach zero , but the acceleration @xmath58 does .",
    "for reasons of consistency with our previous work @xcite , we use a unit system in which mass is measured in units of the primary bh s mass , velocity is measured in units of @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the stellar velocity dispersion and the gravitational constant , respectively ) .",
    "the hard binary separation is defined as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the mass ratio of the secondary and primary bhs and @xmath65 is the mass of the primary . in our units ,",
    "the hard binary separation of an equal mass binary ( @xmath66 ) is 2 .",
    "the base units are therefore scalable by @xmath65 and @xmath61 .",
    "only one parameter is required if we also use the @xmath67@xmath61 relation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the units of length , time and velocity units and their scaling , using @xmath65 and @xmath61 , are @xmath68 & = { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{16 } } gm_\\bullet\\sigma^{-2 } = 0.77\\ m_8^{0.53 } ~{\\rm pc},\\\\ [ { \\rm t } ] & = { \\textstyle\\frac{1}{64 } } gm_\\bullet\\sigma^{-3 } = 1\\,000\\ m_8^{0.29 } ~{\\rm yr},\\label{eq : units - t}\\\\ [ { \\rm v } ] & = 4\\sigma = 750\\ m_8^{0.24 } ~{\\rm km~s^{-1}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the physical mass of the primary bh in units of @xmath70 .",
    "note that in all simulations we used a stellar velocity dispersion of 0.25 velocity units .      in all our simulations ,",
    "stars are initially distributed in a singular isothermal sphere and follow a maxwell  boltzmann distribution with 1d velocity dispersion @xmath61 . to avoid the non - physical divergence of the potential",
    ", we assume a core structure : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an arbitrary break radius set to 1 and @xmath73 .",
    "the expression for the gravitational potential ( or the bulge potential ) derived from the above density is @xmath74 & r > h \\end{cases}\\label{eq : bulge - potential}\\ ] ] @xcite found that massive elliptical galaxies , within their effective radii , are well approximated by a power law ellipsoid with an index of @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite also found that the density of the nuclear star cluster of the milky way can be described by a broken power law with index of @xmath76 down to 0.38 pc .",
    "this is however not appropriate within the bh sphere of influence , if dynamically relaxed , where the equilibrium distribution ( radius independent mass and energy flow ) is the famous @xcite cusp of @xmath77 ( where only one mass species is present , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "unrelaxed clusters around adiabatically growing bhs are expected to have shallower slopes @xcite or steeper slopes in the case of rotating systems and non - isothermal clusters @xcite .    in the case of a minor merger ( equivalent to @xmath78 ) ,",
    "the structure of the more massive galaxy does not change significantly and equation ( [ eq : isothermal - density ] ) likely represents the stellar environment seen by the secondary bh after its parent galaxy is absorbed .",
    "this picture is somewhat nave in the case of a major merger ( @xmath66 ) , but violent relaxation @xcite due to the rapidly varying potential in a newly merged galaxy causes widening of the stellar energy distribution and is analogous to relaxation by collisions in a gas .",
    "this process tends to drive galaxies towards a universal steady state @xcite .",
    "a nice demonstration of this appears in the @xmath0-body merger simulations of @xcite , who find an @xmath79 density profile at the time the equal mass binary becomes hard , which extends down to the scale of the binary separation .    throughout this work",
    "we assume that the bhs are ` naked ' , that is , do not carry clusters of bound stars . in the equal mass case ,",
    "the stellar mass bound to a single bh once the binary becomes hard does not exceed 10 per cent of its mass ( assuming that the cluster also has a power law density profile with index of -2 and normalization based on the @xmath67@xmath61 relation ) .",
    "this will most likely not affect the late time evolution , but will surely affect the early inspiral phase , and the exact inspiral time , but will probably not have a major effect .",
    "below we provide a technical description of the application of the technique described in section [ sec : math ] for an equal mass binary simulation .",
    "the slightly different procedure for the 10:1 mass ratio case is discussed in the following section .",
    "first , a realization of a singular isothermal sphere is produced up to a cutoff radius of @xmath80 , with two equal mass bhs placed on the @xmath81-axis at @xmath82 ; at this initial distance the bhs are still unbound to each other and their inspiraling orbits are governed by the bulge s gravity and dynamical friction . the simulation duration is divided into ( equal ) intervals @xmath4 , after each the stellar force acting on the bhs is updated . the actual time _ steps _ of the ode solver are smaller if necessary , so close encounters can be resolved . within each interval",
    "we do the following :    1 .",
    "symmetrically advance the two bhs from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , under their mutual gravity , and the effective forces exerted by the stars .",
    "the calculated antiparallel @xmath22 and perpendicular @xmath26 embody the stars pull on the bhs , so the bulge potential ( equation [ eq : bulge - potential ] ) should not be considered additionally .",
    "this gives a short orbital segment which is stored in memory .",
    "2 .   advance each star from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , under the influence of the two bhs and the bulge potential .",
    "the motion of the bhs in this interval is already set from the previous stage , so this is essentially a short scattering experiment .",
    "this is the most computationally demanding stage of each iteration , but easily parallelized .",
    "sum up the energies and angular momenta of all stars and subtract the values from the previous iteration to obtain @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "4 .   use the bhs path to obtain @xmath27 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "5 .   calculate @xmath22 and @xmath26 from equations ( [ eq : force - sym - par ] ) and ( [ eq : force - sym - per ] ) , to be used in the next @xmath4 interval .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , our simulations end at @xmath85 time units ( or @xmath86 years for a @xmath87 primary ) ; this is equivalent to @xmath88 revolutions after the binary becomes hard in most equal mass simulations .",
    "integration of a single star is terminated prematurely in three cases : if it reaches a distance of @xmath89 length units from the centre of the system , reaches @xmath90 from either bh or takes more than 35 integration time steps to complete the interval of @xmath91 ( see section [ sec : qa ] ) . in the first case the star is considered to have escaped the system ( or _ diverged _ ) ; the extra 10 length units beyond @xmath80 are an arbitrary ` padding ' required for technical reasons .",
    "the second case represents tidal disruption of the star ( the orbit is then said to have _ crashed _ ) .",
    "the true tidal disruption radius is up to two orders of magnitude smaller than our @xmath92 , but this choice has a negligible effect on the bhs because the rate of crashing stars is negligible compared to the rate of diverging stars .",
    "the choice of @xmath80 is rather arbitrary , and is chosen to be large enough to minimize its effect on the results , as discussed in section [ sec : rmax ] .",
    "notably , the forces on the bhs are one interval retarded .",
    "thus , the interval duration must be short enough in order not to break conservation of energy and angular momentum . in all simulations we chose to use equal intervals of @xmath91 , and since simulations done with this choice both ran reasonably quickly and performed well in terms of conservation , we did not thoroughly investigate changing @xmath4 . certainly making the interval length longer or adaptive",
    "can significantly speed up the simulations .",
    "the code outlined above is very simple in terms of decision making ; the bulk of cpu effort is made to individually advance stars ( scattering experiments ) with only a small non - parallelizable overhead between intervals .",
    "a typical simulation with a large realization ( @xmath93 ) would run for @xmath1 few days on a medium strength personal desktop computer .      as noted in section [ sec : forces ] , the force acting on the bhs can be uniquely found from the energy and angular momentum differences only in the cases of equal masses and high mass ratios ( where it is possible to assume that the primary bh is fixed at the centre ) .",
    "however , when the velocity is perpendicular to the radius vector ( i.e. at pericentre or apocentre ) , the values of @xmath94 approach zero , and thus @xmath95 are left out of the coupled equations ( [ eq : forces - l ] ) and ( [ eq : forces - e ] ) , and can not be solved for . at the same time , @xmath47 are overdetermined as they have to compensate for both energy and angular momentum changes . even in intervals that contain an apsis",
    ", there is usually a solution unless the orbital segment happens to be symmetric about the apsis . since only a few segments are affected , the effect on the bbh orbits is not significant .",
    "in the case of equal masses , no special treatment of these segments was necessary ; but in the case of very high mass ratios ( i.e. @xmath96 ) the finite numerical fluctuations are larger due to the fact that the secondary bh is less massive . in these cases",
    "the total angular momentum would discontinuously drop at an apsis , and the otherwise smooth path would suddenly break at this segment .",
    "we compromised on simulating a 10:1 binary , and utilized two techniques to improve accuracy .",
    "first , each step was performed twice : after calculating the frictional force , the stars and bh were reset to their original positions , and advanced again with the newly calculated force on the bh .",
    "second , we attempted to compensate for the accumulated error : instead of calculating the force components using purely @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the last @xmath4 interval , we added their respective accumulated errors ( the correction term had weight of 0.1 per cent ) .",
    "those adjustments dramatically improved the accuracy of the 10:1 simulations , but unfortunately we did not yet overcome all the technical problems associated with reliably simulating a higher mass ratio inspiral from @xmath97 pc down to stalling separation .",
    "if the routine that advances the stars has a bug or is just not accurate enough , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 obtained in each interval will be faulty ; but since the frictional force is calculated in such a way that would compensate for any change of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the stars , the bug might remain undetected .",
    "thus , an important validity test of @xmath98 and @xmath99 conservation in the code is inherently not available .",
    "we can , however , test the ode solver for a similar problem , and infer that our stellar orbits are at least _ well behaved _ in the original problem . assume a bbh with a circular orbit of constant radius @xmath100 ; the bbh orbit is now decoupled from the stars and each stellar orbit can be integrated separately .",
    "this is the restricted 3-body problem plus a spherically symmetric potential ; as in @xcite , the energy in the rest frame of the bhs ( the frame which rotates with the same angular frequency ) is the only conserved quantity .",
    "the jacobi integral is a constant of motion related to the rest frame energy by @xmath101 .",
    "we performed a number of tests where the bbh was in a circular orbit with a radius in the range of @xmath102 length units .",
    "the stellar model was the same as described in section [ sec : bulge ] and the orbits were evolved for @xmath85 time units .",
    "it was found that @xmath103 is well conserved for the great majority of stars : only 0.2 to 1.6 per cent of orbits were cast off as _ rogue _ orbits , exceeding 35 steps per @xmath91 interval ; the rest had an average @xmath104 of ( 4 to 11)@xmath105 energy units ( @xmath103 is typically of order unity ) .",
    "when applying a short softening length of 0.04 ( corresponding to @xcite ) , 0.2 to 1.7 per cent of orbits were eliminated by the same criterion and the rest had an average @xmath104 of ( 5 to 17)@xmath105 energy units .",
    "thus , we did not apply softening in the actual simulations .",
    "this type of number of steps filter against rogue orbits was found to work better than putting a lower limit on the allowed step size .",
    "accuracy may be improved simply by integrating close encounters with smaller error tolerance , or by employing more elaborate techniques such as regularization .",
    "the small number of stars which are lost due to the ode solver s inability to handle them does not have a significant systematic effect on the bbh orbital evolution .",
    "as noted previously , total energy and angular momentum conservation is not a built - in requirement of the method , but rather indicates a successful transfer of energy and angular from the bbh to the stellar population . in the upper panels of figure [ fig : conservation ] we show energy of the bbh ( solid black line ) , the stellar population ( solid red line ) and their sum ( dashed blue line ) ; the lower panels is the same but for the angular momenta .",
    "the left panel is for an equal mass simulation while the right panel is for a 10:1 mass ratio simulation .",
    "the quality of energy conservation is attested by the absolute difference of total energy between the beginning and the end of the simulation ; it is also useful to look at the fluctuations in total energy , a very crude estimate of which is the amplitude of the largest fluctuation ( this is not a very good measure since fluctuation amplitude can be high in some parts of the orbit mild in others ) .",
    "these two quantities have dimensions of energy , and it is most sensible to normalize them with respect to the absolute difference in the energy of stars ( or the bhs ) .",
    "thus , for a simulation ending at @xmath106 : @xmath107 / |e_\\star(t ) - e_\\star(0)|,\\\\ \\epsilon_2^e(t ) & = { \\rm max}(|e_{\\rm tot}(t ) - \\langle e_{\\rm tot } \\rangle| ) / |e_\\star(t ) - e_\\star(0)|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we similarly define @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the angular momentum .",
    "all these @xmath110 parameters must be very small .",
    "if the quantity that is supposed to be conserved has some trend , then usually @xmath111 , otherwise it only fluctuates around its mean value and @xmath112 .    for an equal mass simulation with @xmath93 ( discussed in detail in section [ sec : n ] ) case at @xmath113 , we get @xmath114 and @xmath115 . for a 10:1 mass ratio simulation ( discussed in detail in section [ sec : e - growth ] ) at @xmath116 , we get @xmath117 and @xmath118 , with a decreasing trend in total energy : @xmath119 .",
    "the trend in total energy begins at @xmath120 and is probably due to the fact that there is an accumulated inaccuracy in the solution of the bhs equations when they are so close together at pericentre .",
    "at @xmath121 we get @xmath122 and @xmath123 with values for the angular momentum similar to the end of the simulation .",
    "thus , the numerical effect previously discussed is unrelated the eccentricity growth observed in this simulation .",

    "<S> we present a new approach to studying the evolution of massive black hole binaries in a stellar environment . by imposing conservation of total energy and angular momentum in scattering experiments , </S>",
    "<S> we find the dissipation forces that are exerted on the black holes by the stars , and thus obtain the decaying path of the binary from the classical dynamical friction regime down to subparsec scales . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme lies between scattering experiments and @xmath0-body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> while still resolving collisions between stars and black holes , it is fast enough and allows to use a large enough number of particles to reach a smooth and convergent result . </S>",
    "<S> we studied both an equal mass and a 10:1 mass ratio binaries under various initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that while an equal mass binary stalls at a nearly circular orbit , a runaway growth of eccentricity occurs in the unequal mass case . </S>",
    "<S> this effect reduces the timescale for black hole coalescence through gravitational radiation to well below the hubble time , even in spherical and gasless systems formed by dry mergers .    </S>",
