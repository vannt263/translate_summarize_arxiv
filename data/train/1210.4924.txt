    "the x - ray source 2xmmj011028.1@xmath4460421 ( hlx-1 ) is the strongest intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) candidate known to date ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is located at a projected distance of @xmath5 kpc from the nucleus of the s0 galaxy eso243 - 49 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 mpc ) .",
    "if the peak x - ray luminosity @xmath8 erg s@xmath3 is eddington limited , the bh mass has to be @xmath9 .",
    "a similar value is obtained by modelling the x - ray spectrum with thermal disc emission ( @xcite ) . its x - ray spectral variability ( @xcite ) and",
    "its radio flares detected in association with the x - ray outbursts ( @xcite ) are consistent with the canonical state transitions and jet properties of an accreting bh .",
    "hlx-1 has a point - like , blue optical counterpart ( @xmath10 mag near the outburst peak ; @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission line at a redshift consistent with that of eso243 - 49 ( @xcite ) is the strongest argument for a true physical association .",
    "it is still debated whether the optical / uv continuum is dominated by the irradiated accretion disc , or by a young star cluster around the bh ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray flux shows recurrent outbursts every @xmath11 d , probably triggered by a sudden increase in the mass trasnfer rate when the donor star is near periastron of a highly eccentric orbit ( @xcite ) . in this scenario",
    ", we can use the x - ray lightcurve to constrain the system parameters .",
    "fits to the _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ , _ swift _ spectra during outbursts have consistently shown that the size of the inner disk ( with @xmath12 kev ) is @xmath13 a few @xmath14 cm ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* farrell et al . 2009 ) , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* farrell et al . 2012 ) ) , consistent with an imbh . instead ,",
    "much less is known about the outer disc radius @xmath15 .",
    "if the disc is the dominant optical emitter , the _ hst _ and vlt studies of ( * ? ?",
    "* farrell et al . ( 2012 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* soria et al . ( 2012 ) ) agree on @xmath16 cm for a face - on disc .",
    "a recent reanalysis of the _ hst _ data ( @xcite ) suggested @xmath17 cm for a viewing angle @xmath18 ( a little smaller if face - on ) .",
    "there is an alternative way to estimate the outer disc size , based on the x - ray outburst decline timescale . following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* king & ritter ( 1998 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* frank et al . ( 2002 ) ) , we assume that the outbursting disc is approximately in a steady state with surface density @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the central accretion rate and @xmath21 the kinematic viscosity . when the whole disc from @xmath22 to @xmath15 is in a hot , high - viscosity state , its total mass @xmath23 where @xmath21 is the kinematic viscosity near the outer edge of the disc ( @xcite ) . integrating eq.(2.1 )",
    "gives an exponential decline for the disc mass , the accretion rate , and the outburst luminosity @xmath24 .",
    "we expect to see a luminosity @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the value at the outburst peak , declining on a timescale @xmath27 , as long as the rate at which the disc mass is depleted during the outburst decline is much larger than any ongoing transfer of mass from the donor star . for the viscosity , we take the usual parameterization @xmath28 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath1 is the viscosity coefficient in the hot state , @xmath29 is the sound speed , and @xmath30 the vertical scaleheight . in the shakura - sunyaev disc solution ( @xcite ) , with kramers opacity , after some algebra we obtain ( @xcite ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath33 g s@xmath3 , @xmath34 is the bh mass in units of @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the exponential decay continues until the outer disc annuli can no longer be kept in the hot state , so that hydrogen recombines and viscosity drops . from that moment ,",
    "the central accretion rate declines linearly ( @xcite ) , with a slope such that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the ( extrapolated ) time in which the accretion rate and luminosity go to zero .",
    "finally , if there is ongoing mass transfer @xmath39 from the donor star during the outburst , the lightcurve has a characteristic `` knee '' at the point where it switches from an exponential to a linear decline ( @xcite ) .",
    "* soria ( 2013 ) ) fitted the _",
    "swift _ x - ray lightcurve of the 2010 outburst ( fig .  1 ) to obtain two independent estimates of the viscous timescale @xmath40 , from the exponential and the linear regime , and",
    "used them to constrain @xmath15 .",
    "for the exponential part , @xmath41 s ( @xmath42 confidence limit ) .",
    "for the linear part , @xmath43 s. assuming a peak accretion rate @xmath44 g s@xmath3 and a viscosity parameter @xmath45 , and more likely @xmath46 ( @xcite ) , both decline timescales give @xmath47 cm .",
    "we also determined e - folding decline timescales @xmath48 s and @xmath49 s for the 2009 and 2011 outbursts , respectively , both consistent with an outer radius @xmath50 cm , in the standard disc approximation .",
    "those values are an order of magnitude smaller than what is estimated by assuming that most of the continuum emission comes from the hot disc ; and the latter is already a small size compared with the semi - major axis .",
    "we can now compare the size of the disc estimated from optical and x - ray flux measurements ( @xmath51 cm @xmath52 cm ) with the characteristic size of the binary system .",
    "the semimajor axis @xmath53 of the binary is @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "typical values for hlx-1 in the imbh scenario are @xmath57 and @xmath58@xmath59 . therefore , the semimajor axis is at least 5 , and possibly up to 100 times larger than the disc radius .",
    "this mismatch clearly suggests an eccentric orbit ( @xcite ) , in which the characteristic disc size is determined by the periastron separation @xmath60 and the tidal truncation radius @xmath61 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* warner 1995 ) ) . for @xmath62",
    "cm , the tidal radius condition requires an eccentricity @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "we can argue that the tidal truncation constraint is not relevant here , if mass transfer occurs impulsively only near periastron : the disc may be small because it does not have time to grow to its tidal truncation radius before being accreted .",
    "instead , the circularization radius provides a stronger _ lower limit _ to the predicted disc size , and is applicable to any system where mass transfer occurs through the lagrangian point l@xmath67 .",
    "the circularization radius @xmath68 is defined via the conservation of angular momentum equation @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the orbital velocity of the accretion stream around the bh , @xmath71 the distance between the bh and l@xmath67 , and @xmath72 the angular velocity of the donor star at periastron .",
    "we computed @xmath73 from eq.(a13 ) of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sepinsky et al . ( 2007 ) ) , valid for eccentric orbits , and found ( @xcite ) @xmath74 for the expected mass ratio and period . for @xmath75 ,",
    "a circularization radius @xmath76 cm requires @xmath77 .",
    "this eccentricity is much more extreme than what was suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lasota et al . ( 2011 ) ) .",
    "it may seem implausible , knowing that tidal forces tend to circularize orbits in x - ray binaries .",
    "however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* sepinsky et al . ( 2007,2009 ) ) showed that in the case of a donor star that transfers mass impulsively only at periastron , with @xmath78 , the secular evolution of the orbit leads to an increase of both eccentricity and semimajor axis , even when the opposite effect of tidal forces is taken into account .",
    "we also assessed whether the donor stars can avoid tidal disruption for such a small periastron distance . comparing this distance to the tidal disruption radius ( @xcite ) , we find that the star survives if @xmath79 , easily satisfied in the likely mass range of hlx-1 .",
    "the small periastron distance sets an upper limit to the radius of the donor star : @xmath80 a few @xmath81 , ruling out supergiants , red giants and agb stars .",
    "possible donors are main sequence ( b type or later ) or subgiants .",
    "there is at least one class of stellar objects where eccentricities @xmath0 are common : s stars observed on highly eccentric orbits within 0.01 pc of the galactic nuclear bh ( @xcite ) .",
    "a possible scenario for the origin of galactic s stars is the tidal disruption of a stellar binary system near the bh , which produces an escaping , hyper - velocity star , and a more tightly bound star on a very eccentric orbit .",
    "galactic bhs in outburst usually show optical emission lines ( _ eg _ , h@xmath1 , h@xmath82 , he 4686 ) from the irradiated outer disk , often with a double - peaked profile . the peak separation or full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) provides an estimate of the projected velocity of the outer disk ( where such lines are mostly emitted ) , and therefore constrains @xmath15 .",
    "we observed hlx-1 with vlt / fors on 2012 aug 2728 , and sep 11 , near outburst peak .",
    "we will present a full discussion of the results in a paper currently in preparation .",
    "our main preliminary result is that we found a strongly significant h@xmath1 emission line on all three nights , strengthening the findings of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wiersema et al . ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "the central wavelength of the line ( averaged over all 3 nights ) is @xmath83  , that is a velocity of 7205 km s@xmath3 , redshifted by @xmath2 km s@xmath3 with respect to the central velocity of eso243 - 49 . for an s0 galaxy of similar size , we expect a maximum stellar rotational velocity @xmath84@xmath85 km s@xmath3 , from the tully - fisher relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "if hlx1 is the remnant of an accreted satellite dwarf ( @xcite ) , it must be moving on an eccentric orbit .",
    "the h@xmath1 line profile is remarkably narrow and single peaked , with a gaussian fwhm @xmath86   @xmath87 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the rotational velocity of a keplerian orbit around the bh at @xmath88 cm is @xmath89 km s@xmath3 ; therefore , a disk line should have a fwhm @xmath90 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that either the disk is seen face on ( @xmath91 ) , or the line is not from a rotating thin disk but from an extended envelope .",
