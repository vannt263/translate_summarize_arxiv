    "the theory of cold dark matter ( cdm ) provides a successful framework for understanding structure formation in the universe . within this paradigm dark matter collapses first into small haloes which merge to form progressively larger haloes over time .",
    "galaxies are thought to form out of gas which cools and collapses to the centers of these dark matter haloes ( white & rees 1978 ) .    in the standard picture of disk galaxy formation",
    "the structural and dynamical properties of disk galaxies are expected to be strongly related to the properties of the dark matter haloes in which they are embedded .",
    "in particular the characteristic sizes and rotation velocities of disk galaxies are determined ( to first order ) by the spin parameter , concentration parameter , and size of the host dark matter halo ( e.g. mo , mao & white 1998 , hereafter mmw ) .",
    "consequently , the detailed rotation curve shapes of disk galaxies can , in principle , be used to constrain the structural properties of their dark matter haloes .",
    "this is especially true for low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , which are believed to be dark matter dominated even at small radii .",
    "a steadily increasing data base of observed lsb rotation curves has resulted in a heated debate as to whether the slopes of the inner density profiles of dark matter dominated disk galaxies are consistent with the cuspy profiles found in n - body simulations , or similarly , whether the inferred concentrations are as high as predicted ( see swaters 2003 and references therein ) .    unfortunately , determining cusp slopes and/or concentration parameters from mass modeling rotation curves is non - unique , even for dark matter dominated galaxies ( e.g. , dutton 2005 ) . in particular , determining @xmath3 requires knowledge of the virial radius , which is hard to constrain using data that only covers the inner @xmath10 of the halo . as an alternative measure of the central density of a halo , alam ,",
    "bullock & weinberg ( 2002 ) introduced a dimensionless quantity that does not require knowledge of the halo virial radius , and demonstrated convincingly that the observed rotation curves of lsb galaxies imply halo concentrations that are systematically lower than predicted for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with a matter density @xmath11 and a scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich power - spectrum with normalization @xmath12 .",
    "further observational support for a lower normalization of the @xmath13 relation comes from the zero point of the rotation velocity - luminosity relation , also known as the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) of disk galaxies ( van den bosch 2000 ) .",
    "detailed disk formation models have clearly demonstrated that the high concentrations of cdm haloes cause an overprediction of the rotation velocities at a fixed disk luminosity , at least for a ` standard ' @xmath14 cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( e.g. , dutton 2007 ; gnedin 2006 ) .",
    "although these discrepancies may indicate a genuine problem for the cdm paradigm , there are a number of alternative explanations : first of all , as shown by various authors ( e.g. swaters 2003 ; rhee 2004 ; spekkens , giovanelli , & haynes 2005 ) the observed rotation curves could be hampered by a variety of observational biases , such as beam smearing , slit offsets and inclination effects , all of which tend to underestimate the circular velocity in the central regions .",
    "secondly , the dark matter distribution could have been modified by astrophysical processes such as bars ( e.g. holley - bockelmann , weinberg , & katz 2005 ) or dynamical friction ( e.g. mo & mao 2004 ; tonini 2006 ) .",
    "these processes tend to lower the concentration of the dark matter halo , bringing it in better agreement with the observations .",
    "on the other hand , adiabatic contraction ( e.g. , blumenthal 1986 ) thought to be associated with the formation of disk galaxies , actually tends to increase the halo concentration , and it remains to be seen whether the above mentioned processes are strong enough to undo this contraction and still cause a relative expansion of the inner halo ( see dutton 2007 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "a third option is that the data - model comparison has been made for the wrong cosmology . in particular ,",
    "a reduction in the power of cosmological density fluctuations on small scales causes a significant reduction of the predicted halo concentrations ( e.g. eke , navarro & steinmetz 2001 ; zentner & bullock 2002 ; alam 2002 ; van den bosch , mo , & yang 2003 ) .",
    "most data - model comparisons have been based on a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath11 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , recently the third year data release from the wmap mission has advocated a model with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( spergel 2006 ) .",
    "this relatively small change in cosmological parameters causes a significant reduction of the predicted halo concentration parameters , bringing them in much better agreement with the data ( e.g. , yang , mo , & van den bosch 2003 ; van den bosch , mo & yang 2003 ) .",
    "another potentially important cause for the discrepancy are systematic errors in the actual model predictions .",
    "both bullock ( 2001a ; hereafter b01 ) and eke , navarro & steinmetz ( 2001 ; hereafter ens ) presented analytical models that allow one to compute the mean halo concentration for given halo mass , redshift and cosmology .",
    "unfortunately , at redshift zero the predictions of these models are divergent below @xmath19 , with the ens model predicting halo concentrations that are significantly lower .",
    "this is of particular importance for lsb ( and dwarf ) galaxies with @xmath20 , which are thought to typically reside in haloes with masses below this value .",
    "both b01 and ens calibrated their models against numerical simulations .",
    "those of b01 probed the mass range between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while those of ens probed an even narrower range from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( albeit with higher resolution ) .",
    "what is needed to discriminate between these models are simulations that resolve a large population of low mass haloes , which is one of the main objectives of this paper .",
    "another important issue that we wish to address in this paper is the possibility that the lsb disk galaxies that have been used to constrain halo concentrations reside in a biased sub - set of haloes ( see discussion in wechsler 2006 ) .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that there is a significant scatter in both halo concentration , @xmath3 , and halo spin parameter , @xmath4 , at a given halo mass ( e.g. bullock 2001a , b ) .",
    "thus if disk galaxies form in a biased subset of haloes , this could lead to an apparent discrepancy between theory and observation .",
    "in fact , there are a number of potential causes for such a bias .",
    "first of all , disk galaxies are expected to preferentially form in haloes that have not experienced any recent major merger .",
    "there is evidence that such a subset of haloes has higher mean @xmath3 , lower mean @xmath4 , and lower scatter in both @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( wechsler 2002 ; donghia & burkert 2004 ) .",
    "clearly , this would worsen the disagreement between model and data . on the other hand , it has also been suggested that lsb galaxies preferentially reside in haloes with relatively low concentrations .",
    "first of all , since disks are thought to be in centrifugal equilibrium , less concentrated haloes will harbor less concentrated ( i.e. , lower surface brightness ) disk galaxies ( e.g. , mmw , b01 ) .",
    "in addition , using numerical simulations bailin ( 2005 ) found that haloes with higher spin parameters have , on average , lower concentration parameters .",
    "since lsb galaxies are thought to be those with high spin parameters such a correlation would imply that lsb galaxies reside in haloes with relatively low concentrations .",
    "if confirmed this could offer an alternative explanation as to why ( some ) lsb galaxies have lower concentrations than predicted .",
    "note , however , that previous studies ( b01 , navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ) , have found no correlation between spin parameter and concentration .",
    "another potential bias for disk galaxy formation could arise if there is a correlation between environment ( defined as the large scale matter density ) and @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , harker ( 2006 ) found evidence that low mass haloes in dense environments assemble earlier than haloes of the same mass in under - dense environments .",
    "note however , that for the lowest density environments this trend reverses so that formation redshifts actually increase with decreasing density . since haloes that assemble later",
    "are less concentrated ( wechsler 2002 ) , one thus may expect a similar correlation between halo concentration and environmental density . if dwarf and lsb galaxies preferentially form in under - dense regions this could also help explain the lower than expected halo concentrations of these galaxies .",
    "in this paper we study galaxy size dark matter haloes from a set of cosmological n - body simulations with the following goals : ( i ) to test the predictions of b01 and ens regarding the halo concentrations of low mass haloes ( down to @xmath25 ) , ( ii ) to determine the scatter in concentration , spin parameter , and halo shape at a given mass , ( iii ) to determine whether there is a correlation between the spin and concentration parameters , and ( iv ) to determine whether @xmath3 , @xmath4 and halo shape depend on the density of the environment in which the halo is located .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes our set of n - body simulations . in section  3",
    "we discuss how halo concentration , halo spin parameter and halo shape depend on halo mass .",
    "sections  4 investigates whether @xmath3 and @xmath4 are correlated , while section  5 focuses on the environment dependence of halo properties . in section  6",
    "we use simple models for disk formation to investigate whether one expects lsb galaxies to reside in haloes with a biased concentration parameter .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  7 .",
    "in order to explore as wide a range of virial masses as possible , we run simulations of 4 different box sizes , listed in table  1 . for comparison",
    "we also show the parameters of the bullock ( 2001a , b ) , bailin ( 2005 ) and millennium run ( springel 2005 ) simulations .",
    "the b01 simulation has similar size and mass resolution as our 64@xmath26 boxes , while our smallest box simulation has a mass resolution that is @xmath27 times higher than that of bailin ( 2005 ) . in order to test for cosmic variance , and to increase the size of our sample we ran two simulations for each of the three smallest box sizes .",
    "all simulations have been performed with pkdgrav , a tree code written by joachim stadel and thomas quinn ( stadel 2001 ) .",
    "the code uses spline kernel softening , for which the forces become completely newtonian at 2 softening lengths .",
    "individual time steps for each particle are chosen proportional to the square root of the softening length , @xmath28 , over the acceleration , @xmath29 : @xmath30 . throughout , we set @xmath31 , and we keep the value of the softening length constant in comoving coordinates during each run .",
    "the physical values of @xmath28 at @xmath32 are listed in table  1 .",
    "forces are computed using terms up to hexadecapole order and a node - opening angle @xmath33 which we change from @xmath34 initially to @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "this allows a higher force accuracy when the mass distribution is nearly smooth and the relative force errors can be large .",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with parameters from the first year wmap results ( spergel 2003 ) : matter density @xmath37 , baryon density @xmath38 , hubble constant @xmath39 , and a scale - invariant , harrison - zeldovich power - spectrum with normalization @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the spectral index . in a forthcoming paper ( macci , in preparation )",
    "we investigate the effects of these new cosmological parameter on our results .",
    "the main change regards a lower normalization of the concentration , as expected from the b01 and ens models . ] .",
    "the initial conditions are generated with the grafic2 package ( bertschinger 2001 ) , which also computes the transfer function as described in ma & bertschinger ( 1995 ) .",
    "the starting redshifts @xmath42 are set to the time when the standard deviation of the smallest density fluctuations resolved within the simulation box reaches @xmath43 ( the smallest scale resolved within the initial conditions is defined as twice the intra - particle distance , while the maximum scale is set by the box size ) .    .n - body simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     interestingly we find that haloes with the lowest @xmath44 tend to have larger @xmath3 , smaller scatter in @xmath3 , and lower @xmath45 .",
    "a similar result for halo @xmath3 was found by jing ( 2000 ) , who used the maximum deviation of the density profile from the nfw fit , which is similar to our @xmath44 parameter . in table  2",
    "we show the effect of the rms parameter on the mean and scatter of halo @xmath3 and @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the zero point of the @xmath47 relation , measured at @xmath48 . to allow for comparison with jing ( 2000 ) we only use haloes with @xmath49 .",
    "we find that the highest @xmath44 haloes have a mean @xmath3 which is roughly a factor of 2 lower , and a scatter in @xmath3 which is roughly a factor of 2 higher , than the lowest @xmath44 haloes , in agreement with jing ( 2000 ) .",
    "additionally we also find a factor of 2 difference between the average @xmath45 of the highest and lowest @xmath44 haloes .",
    "haloes with the highest @xmath44 have the highest mean offset parameter , @xmath50 , and the lowest mean halo shape parameter , @xmath51 .",
    "this suggests that these haloes are the most unrelaxed .",
    "the trends between @xmath3 and @xmath45 with @xmath7 are shown in the third column of fig .",
    "[ fig : dcl_all ] .",
    "these show that for haloes with small @xmath7 the residuals are uncorrelated with @xmath7 . however , these haloes have concentrations that are higher and spin parameters that are lower than the overall average . for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 )",
    "there is a clear systematic trend that haloes with larger @xmath7 have lower @xmath3 and higher @xmath45 .",
    "the same trends are seen for @xmath5 , where more prolate haloes ( of a given mass ) have lower @xmath3 and higher @xmath45 .",
    "this basically reflects the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all5 ] ) .",
    "these trends are consistent with unrelaxed haloes being the systems that experienced a recent major merger : ( i ) the center of the halo is poorly defined , which results in a large @xmath7 and an artificially shallow ( low concentration ) density profile , ( ii ) the halo shape is more prolate , and ( iii ) the spin parameter is higher due to the orbital angular momentum ` transferred ' to the system due to the merger ( e.g. , vitvitska 2002 ; maller , dekel & somerville 2002 ) . ideally one would test the correspondence between merger histories and @xmath7 using the actual merger trees extracted from the simulation .",
    "unfortunately , we did not store sufficient outputs to be able to do so .",
    "we intend to address these issues in a future paper , based on a new set of simulations .",
    "we now split our sample into 4 sub - samples according to @xmath44 and @xmath7 , with dividers of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which correspond to the mean of the distributions of @xmath44 and @xmath7 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all5 ] ) .",
    "we refer to the 4-subsamples as :    * good@xmath56 ( @xmath57 & @xmath58 ) ; * bad@xmath59 ( @xmath57 & @xmath60 ) ; * ugly@xmath61 ( @xmath62 & @xmath60 ) ; * noisy ( @xmath62 & @xmath58 ) .",
    "[ fig : clm_good ] shows the @xmath13 and @xmath63 relations for the haloes in the good sub - sample with @xmath64 . as with the full sample , this @xmath13 relation",
    "is well fitted with a single power - law given by @xmath65 -0.098[\\pm0.009](\\log\\mvir -12).\\ ] ] this relation has a slope that is @xmath8 percent shallower and a zero point that is @xmath8 percent higher than for the full sample ( eq .  [ [ fullc ] ] ) .",
    "the total scatter about this mean relation is @xmath66 and the intrinsic scatter is @xmath67 , about @xmath68 percent lower than for the full sample .",
    "the b01 model again accurately fits the @xmath13 relation , but with @xmath69 ( for @xmath70 ) . for @xmath71",
    "the best - fit value for @xmath72 is @xmath73 .",
    "the slope of the @xmath74 relation for low mass haloes is still consistent with that predicted by the b01 model but steeper than the prediction of the ens model .",
    "thus , the fact that ens only compared their model to a small sample of well relaxed haloes can not explain the discrepancy between their results and those of b01 . as already eluded to above , the main reason the ens model was found to be consistent with their own simulations is that the haloes in their simulation only covered a small range in halo masses , over which the difference in slope with respect to the b01 model is difficult to infer .",
    "the slope of the @xmath63 relation is again consistent with zero .",
    "however , the median is @xmath9 percent lower ( @xmath75 ) and the intrinsic scatter is reduced by @xmath76 percent ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these differences in @xmath78 between the full set of haloes and our good sub - sample are almost identical to those obtained by wechsler ( 2002 ) between all haloes and haloes without a major merger since @xmath36 .",
    "this reinforces the notion that our good sub - sample consists mostly of haloes which have not experienced a recent major merger .    fig .",
    "[ fig : qm5 ] shows the dependence of the halo shape parameter @xmath5 on halo mass .",
    "we find that more massive haloes are on average more flattened ( more prolate ) , in qualitative agreement with previous studies ( jing & suto 2002 ; kasun & evrard 2005 ; bailin & steinmetz 2005 ; allgood 2006 ) . as shown in allgood ( 2006 ) , the halo shape is fairly tightly related to the halo assembly time , such that haloes that assemble later are less spherical ( and less relaxed ) . to first order",
    "this explains the decrease of @xmath5 with increasing halo mass , as well as the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all5 ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : qm5 ] also shows that haloes with high @xmath7 ( bad and ugly sub - samples ) have a lower median @xmath5 , as well as a much more pronounced tail to low @xmath5 .",
    "note also that there are very few highly prolate haloes ( @xmath79 ) with low @xmath7 ( noisy and good sub - samples ) .",
    "a potentially important implication of this is that ( lsb ) disk galaxies , which are too fragile to survive in unrelaxed haloes , are unlikely to reside in strongly flattened haloes .",
    "in their study of the halo angular momentum distributions , bullock ( 2001b ) noticed that haloes with high @xmath45 have concentration parameters that are slightly lower than average .",
    "although such a correlation may not be totally unexpected , since both the spin parameter and concentration parameter depend on the mass accretion history ( wechsler 2002 ; vitvitska 2002 ) , bullock argued that the @xmath3-@xmath45 anti - correlation is a mere ` artifact ' from the fact that ( i ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 are uncorrelated ( see also nfw ) , and ( ii ) @xmath4 and @xmath45 are related via @xmath80 ( see section  [ sec : spinpar ] ) .",
    "however , bailin ( 2005 ) used the @xmath81 definition for the spin parameter ( which should be equal to @xmath4 ) and claimed a significant anti - correlation between halo concentration and spin parameter .",
    "as discussed in bailin ( 2005 ) , such an anti - correlation may have important implications for the interpretation of the rotation curves of lsb disk galaxies ( see discussion in section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "using our large suite of simulations , we therefore re - investigate this issue .",
    "bailin ( 2005 ) focused on haloes with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl5 ] we plot the halo concentration as a function of the three different definitions of the spin parameter ; @xmath45 , @xmath81 and @xmath4 . to facilitate the comparison with bailin we only select haloes in our simulations with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "all three plots reveal a weak but significant correlation in that the lowest concentration haloes have relatively low spin parameters .",
    "contrary to nfw and bullock ( 2001b ) , but in agreement with bailin ( 2005 ) , we therefore argue that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are correlated .",
    "note that resolution is not an issue here , since we obtain the same result in each of our different simulations .",
    "due to the mass dependence of @xmath3 , a more illustrative way to look for a correlation between halo concentration and spin parameter is to plot the residuals ( at constant @xmath86 ) of the @xmath13 and @xmath63 relations .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcl5 ] for all haloes with @xmath64 .",
    "the lower left panel shows the residuals for the full sample , which reveals a clear trend that haloes with high @xmath45 have lower than average @xmath3 .",
    "we now split the haloes into the four sub - samples defined above , and plot their residuals ( with respect to the mean @xmath74 and mean @xmath45 for the good sub - sample ) .",
    "this shows that the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath45 is , at least partially , due to the inclusion of haloes with high @xmath7 ( i.e. , haloes that are unrelaxed ) , independent of whether the halo has a high or low @xmath44 : the correlation is clearly more pronounced for the ugly and bad sub - samples .",
    "however , the good and noisy sub - samples still reveal a small trend that haloes with larger @xmath45 offsets have a lower @xmath3 offset .",
    "we have repeated this analysis using @xmath81 and @xmath87 , and the small correlation between residuals in the good and noisy sub - samples remains .",
    "we therefore conclude that there indeed is a small intrinsic correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath45 at a fixed @xmath86 .",
    "however , when excluding the unrelaxed haloes , the amplitude of this correlation is very weak compared to the scatter in both parameters . in section  [ sec : sbdisk ] below we investigate to what extent this small correlation may effect ( lsb ) disk galaxies .",
    "we now investigate whether the concentration , spin parameter and shape of dark matter haloes are correlated with the large scale environment in which they are located .",
    "this is interesting because disk galaxies , and lsbs in particular , are preferentially found in regions of intermediate to low density ( mo 1994 ; rosenbaum & bomans 2004 ) .",
    "if haloes in low density environments have different structural properties than haloes of the same mass in over - dense environments , this would therefore imply that the haloes of ( lsb ) disk galaxies are not a fair representation of the average halo population .    using a set of numerical simulations , for different cosmologies , lk99 studied the environment dependence of dark matter haloes .",
    "the only halo parameter that was found to be correlated with environment is halo mass ( denser environments contain more massive haloes ) .",
    "halo concentration , spin parameter , shape and assembly redshift is defined as the time at which the most massive progenitor has a mass equal to @xmath88 . ] were all found to be uncorrelated with halo environment .",
    "however , using exactly the same simulations as lk99 , sheth & tormen ( 2004 ) found clear evidence that halo assembly times correlate with environment based on a marked correlation function analysis .",
    "a similar result was obtained by gao , springel & white ( 2005 ) , who used the millennium simulation ( springel 2005 ) to demonstrate that the low mass haloes that assemble early are more strongly clustered than haloes of the same mass that assemble later . for massive haloes ,",
    "however , the dependence on the assembly time was found to diminish .",
    "this has since been confirmed by a number of studies ( harker 2006 ; zhu 2006 ; wetzel 2007 ; jing , suto & mo 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , it has been found that the clustering of haloes also depends on other halo properties , such as halo concentration , halo spin parameter , subhalo properties , and the time since the last major merger ( wechsler 2006 ; zhu 2006 ; wetzel 2007 ; gao & white 2007 ; but see also percival 2003 ) , which is not too surprising given that all these properties correlate with halo formation time ( e.g. , wechsler 2002 ; van den bosch , tormen & giocoli 2005 ) .",
    "all these results seem to overrule the finding by lk99 , and seem to suggest that dark matter properties depend rather sensitively on their large scale environment .    using our large sample of objects ,",
    "we investigate whether the concentration , spin parameter and shape of haloes are correlated with the large scale environment in which they are located . rather than using ( marked ) correlation functions ,",
    "we follow lk99 and correlate the halo properties with the overdensity , @xmath89 , measured in spheres of radius @xmath90(with @xmath91 ) centered on each halo : @xmath92 the results for all haloes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mclomega_all ] .",
    "the top row shows the relation between virial mass and overdensity .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the overdensity at the virial radius .",
    "the solid diagonal line indicates the mass scale @xmath93 .",
    "thus all haloes with @xmath94 less than the filter radius should lie below this line , as is the case .",
    "note that we do not include sub - haloes in our analysis , so the only haloes that can have very high densities @xmath95 must be haloes with virial radii close to the filter radius , as is the case .",
    "we see that more massive haloes tend to live in more overdense regions ( cf .",
    "lk99 ) . as the filter radius",
    "is increased the mean overdensity tends towards zero , and the scatter in overdensity is reduced , as expected . note that we do not compute the overdensity on @xmath96 scales in the simulations with the smallest box size .",
    "the second , third and fourth rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : mclomega_all ] show the residuals ( at fixed @xmath86 ) of the @xmath3-@xmath86 , @xmath45-@xmath86 and @xmath5-@xmath86 relations , respectively , all as function of overdensity .",
    "the roughly horizontal lines with errorbars indicate the mean residual ( plus its errors ) as function of overdensity , while the dashed lines outline the @xmath97 scatter .",
    "note that , within the errors on the mean , there is no significant indication that the residuals are larger or smaller in regions that are over- or under - dense .",
    "in other words , these results are in excellent agreement with those of lk99 and seem to suggest that halo properties are independent of their large scale environment .",
    "note that our results cover a much wider dynamic range in halo mass , and are based on higher - resolution simulations than in the case of lk99 .",
    "how can this be reconciled with the findings based on the correlation function analyses described above ?",
    "some insight is provided by the roughly vertical lines with errorbars ( in the second , third and fourth rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : mclomega_all ] ) , which indicate the average overdensity ( plus its error ) for haloes in a given residual bin .",
    "the corresponding dotted lines outline the @xmath98 scatter .",
    "these show that haloes with the largest concentration , largest spin parameter , and/or that are most spherical ( all with respect to the average for their mass ) are located in slightly denser environments .",
    "since the correlation function reflects ensemble averages , this seems consistent with the findings that more concentrated haloes and/or those with a larger spin parameter are more strongly clustered .",
    "we emphasize , though , that the trends seen in fig .  [ fig : mclomega_all ] are ( i ) weaker when environment is measured over a larger volume , ( ii ) only reveal an environment dependence at the extremes of the residual distributions , and ( iii ) largely vanish when we only focus on haloes in our good sub - sample ( not shown ) .",
    "as emphasized in harker ( 2006 ) , in order to reveal the correlation between environment and assembly time , it is important to only consider haloes in a relatively small mass range .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [",
    "fig : dclomega ] we plot the residuals of the @xmath13 relation versus overdensity in @xmath99 spheres for haloes in mass bins with a width of 0.5 dex .",
    "the various lines and errorbars have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mclomega_all ] . for haloes with @xmath100",
    "there is a weak , mildly significant indication that haloes in denser environments have slightly higher concentrations ( reflected by close - to - horizontal lines ) .",
    "more pronounced , however , is the trend that more concentrated haloes live on average in denser environments ( reflected by close - to - vertical lines ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that more concentrated , low mass haloes are more strongly clustered ( cf .",
    "wechsler 2006 ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",

[ fig : mclomega_all ] where we add all the masses together ) .",
    "again this is in good agreement with the clustering results of wechsler ( 2006 ) and gao & white ( 2007 ) , who found that the dependence on halo concentration vanishes for haloes with masses close to the typical collapsing mass , @xmath102 : for the cosmology assumed in our simulations @xmath103 .",
    "thus , our results are in good agreement with the various claims based on correlation function analyses .",
    "they also illustrate , though , that the trends are weak compared to the scatter , which explains why lk99 did not notice any environment dependence .",
    "only when one carefully estimates the average environment as function of halo property , which is what a correlation function measures , does the environment dependence reveal itself .",
    "figure  [ fig : dclomegab ] shows the residuals , at fixed @xmath86 , of the @xmath63 relation as function of @xmath104 for the same mass bins as in fig .",

    "this is inconsistent with gao & white ( 2007 ) who found that higher spin haloes are more strongly clustered than low spin haloes of the same mass .",
    "it is unclear why our analysis of the environmental densities does not recover this trend , while it does reproduce the trend for the halo concentrations .",
    "finally , fig .",

    "this seems at odds with fig .",
    "[ fig : mclomega_all ] ( fourth row ) , which shows that the most spherical haloes ( those with large positive @xmath105 ) live in denser environments .",
    "this apparent discrepancy simply reflects number statistics : only the haloes in the bin with @xmath106 seem to reside in regions that are denser than average .",
    "when split in mass bins , however , there are too few haloes with @xmath107 to reveal the signal .",
    "we now investigate whether lsb disk galaxies are expected to reside in dark matter haloes that form a biased sub - set in terms of their concentration parameters . in the mmw model",
    "the central surface density of an exponential disk , @xmath108 , is determined by @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath86 , and the galaxy mass fraction @xmath109 ( defined as the ratio between disk mass and halo mass ) .",

    "lower mass haloes have higher concentrations , @xmath4 and @xmath3 are weakly anti - correlated ( see section  [ sec : clcorr ] ) , and @xmath109 is expected to increase with @xmath86 due to various astrophysical feedback processes .    to investigate the impact of all these relations on the surface brightness of disk galaxies , we construct mmw type models as described in dutton ( 2007 ) .",
    "these models consist of an exponential disk , a hernquist bulge and a nfw halo .",
    "the halo parameters are @xmath86 , @xmath3 and @xmath81 ( @xmath111 ) , which we take directly from the haloes of our good sub - sample .",
    "an additional parameter is the galaxy mass fraction @xmath109 , which we fix to @xmath112 for simplicity .",
    "the bulge formation recipe is based on disk instability , and therefore only effects the highest surface brightness disks ; the details of this bulge formation recipe are not important for this work .",
    "we assume that the halo is unaffected by the formation of the disk , i.e. we do not consider adiabatic contraction .",
    "as highlighted in dutton ( 2007 ) , models with adiabatic contraction are unable to simultaneously match the zero - point of the tully - fisher relation and the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the mmw formalism gives the galaxy mass , @xmath113 , baryonic disk scale length , @xmath114 , and central surface density of the baryonic disk , @xmath115 .",

    "as expected , there is a strong correlation between @xmath128 and @xmath81 , in that haloes with larger spin parameters host lower surface density disks .",
    "the flattening of this relation at low @xmath81 owes to our bulge formation recipe . at fixed @xmath81 ,",
    "more massive haloes have higher @xmath108 , despite their ( on average ) smaller concentrations . the scatter in @xmath3 at a fixed @xmath86 results in some overlap between the three mass samples , but the three mass ranges are clearly visible .",
    "thus , the dependence of surface density on halo mass is at least as important as the dependence on halo concentration .",
    "the same trends are seen in the relation between surface density of the _ stellar _ disk and spin parameter .",
    "however the mass separation is no longer present in the relation between surface brightness and spin parameter .",
    "this is because , at a given @xmath119 , more massive haloes have higher stellar mass - to - light ratios , and hence lower surface brightness .",
    "the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scl2-good ] plots the halo concentration versus the halo spin parameter . although these parameters seem uncorrelated , there is a weak anti - correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath81 , as discussed in section  [ sec : clcorr ] .",
    "the fact that this correlation is not as pronounced as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl5 ] , is due to the fact that here we only consider the good sub - sample .",
    "the other three panels in the lower row show the correlation between halo concentration and disk surface density ( or brightness ) . for haloes of a given mass",
    ", there is a clear correlation in that more concentrated haloes host higher surface density ( brightness ) disks .",

    "less massive haloes have higher @xmath3 as expected . at a fixed halo mass ,",
    "there is a clear trend that lower surface brightness disks reside in less concentrated haloes .",
    "if we define lsb galaxies as those with a central surface brightness @xmath136 , we find that they live in a sub - set of haloes whose average concentration ( at fixed halo mass ) is @xmath137 percent lower than the overall average for that halo mass .",
    "we therefore conclude halo concentrations inferred from lsb rotation curves should not be compared to @xmath138 , but rather to @xmath139 , with @xmath140 a bias correction factor .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained by bailin ( 2005 ) , except that they found a bias correction factor of @xmath141 . as discussed in section  [ sec : clcorr ] this owes to the fact that they did not remove unrelaxed haloes from their sample .",
    "since we consider it unlikely that lsb galaxies reside in unrelaxed haloes , we belief our bias correction factor to be more realistic .    finally , in order to investigate the origin of this bias",
    ", we have run a control sample with the same distributions of @xmath86 , @xmath3 and @xmath81 as the simulation data , but with no correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath81 .",
    "this reduces the correction factor to @xmath142 , and therefore shows that the main contribution to @xmath143 owes to the ( very weak ) anti - correlation between halo concentration and halo spin parameter .",
    "the remaining contribution simply reflects that centrifugally supported disks in less concentrated haloes will be less concentrated themselves .",
    "in this paper we have used a set of cosmological n - body simulations to study the scaling relations , at redshift zero , between the concentration parameter , @xmath3 , spin parameter , @xmath45 , shape parameter , @xmath5 , and mass , @xmath86 , of a large sample of dark matter haloes . due to the combined set of simulations",
    ", we were able to extend previous studies to a mass range at least an order of magnitude smaller , covering the full range of masses in which galaxies are expected to form : @xmath144 .    for this mass range",
    "we find @xmath6 , which is in agreement with the model of bullock ( 2001a ) , but in disagreement with the model of eke , navarro & steinmetz ( 2001 ) which predicts a significantly shallower slope .",
    "the single free parameter of the ens model only controls the normalization of the @xmath13 relation , so that their model can not be tuned to fit the data .",
    "the ens model has also been shown to be unable to match the slope of the @xmath13 relation for low mass haloes at @xmath145 ( coln 2004 ) .",
    "for the bullock ( 2001a ) model our data is well fitted with a model with @xmath70 and @xmath146 ( where the error reflects our estimate of cosmic variance ) .",
    "note that this normalization is 15 percent lower than the @xmath147 originally proposed by bullock ( 2001a ) , but it is in good agreement with zhao ( 2003 ) and kuhlen ( 2005 ) , who found a best - fit normalization of @xmath148 .",
    "this discrepancy is at least partially due to an inconsistency with the use of transfer functions in the work of bullock et al .",
    "if they use the same transfer functions to set up the initial conditions of their simulations and to compute the model predictions , they obtain @xmath149 .",
    "this is however significantly higher than can be accounted for by our estimate of cosmic variance .",
    "we find an intrinsic scatter in @xmath3 and @xmath45 at fixed @xmath86 of @xmath150 and @xmath151 , and a median spin parameter of @xmath152 , all in good agreement with bullock ( 2001a , b ) .    in an attempt to distinguish between relaxed and unrelaxed haloes",
    "we introduce a new and simple parameter : @xmath7 which is defined as the distance between the most bound particle and the center of mass , in units of the virial radius .",
    "the distribution of @xmath7 is approximately log - normal with a median @xmath153 .",
    "the full set of haloes shows strong correlations between @xmath7 and the residuals of the @xmath13 and @xmath63 relations , such that haloes with larger @xmath7 have a larger than average @xmath45 and a lower than average @xmath3 . removing haloes with large @xmath7",
    "therefore results in a higher mean concentration , a lower mean spin parameter , and in less scatter in both the @xmath13 and @xmath63 relations .",
    "the median spin parameter of ` relaxed ' ( good ) haloes is @xmath75 with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath77 .",
    "the average @xmath78 of ` relaxed ' haloes is again in good agreement with the model of b01 , but with @xmath70 and @xmath154 , and with a reduced intrinsic scatter of @xmath155 .    a better fit to the @xmath13 relation for high mass haloes ( @xmath156 ) can be obtained with @xmath71 and @xmath157 ( for all haloes ) , and @xmath158 ( for good haloes ) .",
    "this is , however , at the expense of under predicting the concentrations for the low mass haloes ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "we also find a strong correlation between the mean axis ratio of the haloes , @xmath5 , and @xmath7 , such that more prolate haloes ( i.e. , those with lower @xmath5 ) have higher @xmath7 , on average .",
    "this suggests that the majority of haloes with small axis ratios are unrelaxed , and thus that fragile lsb galaxies are unlikely to reside in haloes that are strongly aspherical .",
    "this makes it less likely that the discrepancy between observed and predicted rotation curves is due to the fact that disks are strongly elliptical , as suggested by hayashi ( 2004 ) .",
    "we have also investigated the environment dependence of the residuals in @xmath3 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is interesting because disk galaxies , and lsbs in particular , are preferentially found in regions of intermediate to low density ( mo 1994 ; rosenbaum & bomans 2004 ) .",
    "defining ` environment ' by the matter overdensity within spheres of radii @xmath160 and @xmath161mpc , we find at the low mass end ( @xmath162 ) that more concentrated haloes live in denser environments than their less concentrated counterparts of the same mass .",
    "this is consistent with the studies of wechsler ( 2006 ) and gao & white ( 2007 ) who found a similar trend using correlation functions .",
    "however , as we have shown , this trend is weak compared to the scatter , which explains why lemson & kauffmann ( 1999 ) did not notice any environment dependence in their simulation .",
    "contrary to the halo concentrations , the halo spin parameters reveal no environment dependence at fixed mass .",
    "this is at odds with the results of gao & white ( 2007 ) who found that haloes with a large spin parameter are more strongly clustered than low spin haloes of the same mass .",
    "finally we find a weak trend that the most spherical haloes reside in slightly denser environments",
    ".    finally , using a simple model for disk galaxy formation , we investigated the properties of the ( expected ) host haloes of lsb disk galaxies ( i.e. , those with a central surface brightness @xmath163 ) .",
    "in addition to having higher than average spin parameters , in agreement with numerous other studies ( e.g. , dalcanton 1997 ; jimenez 1998 ) , we also find that the host haloes of lsb galaxies have concentrations that are biased low by about 15 percent .",
    "this correlation between halo concentration and disk surface brightness ( or density ) owes largely to a ( weak ) anti - correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath3 , and to the fact that centrifugal equilibrium commands that less concentrated haloes host less concentrated disks .",
    "the amplitude of this correlation is significantly smaller than what has been advocated by bailin ( 2005 ) , but this owes to the fact that these authors did not remove unrelaxed haloes , which are unlikely to host fragile lsb galaxies , from their analysis .",
    "all these results have important implications for the interpretation of the halo concentrations inferred from lsb rotation curves .",
    "numerous studies in the past have argued that these are too low compared to the predictions for a @xmath0cdm cosmology ( e.g. , alam 2002 ; mcgaugh 2003 ; de blok 2003 ) .",
    "however , there are several reasons why we now believe that the model predictions where too high .",
    "first of all , virtually all previous predictions were made for a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath164 and @xmath16 ( or @xmath12 ) . however ,",
    "if one adopts the cosmology favored by the three year data release of the wmap mission ( spergel 2006 ) , one predicts concentrations that are about 25 percent lower ( macci , in preparation ) .",
    "compared to a @xmath0cdm model with @xmath164 and @xmath12 the concentrations are 35 percent lower .",
    "secondly , the b01 model ( with @xmath70 and @xmath147 ) overpredicts the halo concentrations by @xmath9 percent .",
    "if we take into account that lsbs only reside in relaxed haloes , this is lowered to a @xmath165 percent effect . and finally , one needs to correct for the fact that lsb galaxies reside in a biased sub - set of haloes , which is another 15 percent effect . combining all these effects ,",
    "it is clear that the halo concentrations predicted were almost a factor two too large .",
    "this brings models and data into much better agreement .",
