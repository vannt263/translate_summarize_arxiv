    "it is common to assume the control fields used to manipulate quantum systems are of infinite strength and therefore classical .",
    "it is possible , however , to relax this assumption , and to treat them within the quantum formalism @xcite - that is , as systems of bounded size / strength , and to then investigate the limitations that this finiteness does or does not impose . from the perspective of quantum computing this could be desirable because the inevitable miniaturization of quantum information processing devices - such as ion trap chips - may make using small strength control fields a necessity ( current proposals would require hundreds of watts of laser power for a full scale quantum computation ) .",
    "from the perspective of quantum communication the issue of finite - sized reference frames raises interesting questions regarding the fact that the shared references commonly used by the separated parties can drift , and realigning them requires further resource expenditure .",
    "finally , there are interesting foundational reasons for considering finite - sized references @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "an example is the work on finite precision measurements , black hole entropy and symmetry deformations@xcite,@xcite .",
    "another example , more pertinent to the work to be presented here , is the work on `` quantum clocks '' - for instance the page - wootters model of a clock which has developed into the the conditional probability interpretation of time in quantum gravity @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we continue a line of investigation @xcite,@xcite into a simple model of degradation of a quantum reference frame consisting a large spin system as it repeatedly interacts with a series of incoming `` source '' particles . in @xcite this program of investigation",
    "was initiated by considering a source of unpolarized spin-1/2 particles , each of which has its component of spin measured against a reference spin directional frame , by implementing the optimal measurement @xcite for determining the relative direction between the frame and the system .",
    "an example of such a procedure might be the measurement of qubits in a bb84 key - distribution protocol by a finite strength magnetic field .",
    "the conclusion there was that in such circumstances the reference would be useful for a time ( number of uses ) that scales quadratically in the size ( ie spin ) of the reference .",
    "this conclusion was shown to be quite generally true for rotationally invariant source particles in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the investigation was simplified and extended to the case where the source of particles has some net polarization - such as in a b92 type key distribution for example .",
    "an interesting result of @xcite was that in this instance the drift of the reference frame was more important to its degradation that the `` diffusion '' caused by the entanglement with the particles , and now the reference would only be useful for a time linear in its size .    both @xcite and @xcite considered the case of _ measuring _ the source particles against the reference frame .",
    "the results of @xcite also apply , however , to the case where we use the reference as a mechanism for doing coherent ( unitary ) interactions between the reference and an unpolarized stream of source particles . in this article",
    "we consider the case of degradation when we do coherent interactions between the reference system and a polarized source of particles .",
    "we also consider how well one might correct for the reference frame drift in a simple model wherein we are given , in addition to the polarized set of source particles , a smaller number of particles which are known to have a polarization in a direction opposite to those of the source .",
    "we begin , however , by revisiting the case of using the reference to implement measurements on a polarized source of particles , exploring in more detail the dynamics in the case that the measurement results are _ not _ averaged over .",
    "we briefly introduce the formalism for our investigations by recapping the case of a directional quantum reference frame ( qrf ) used for measurement ; in the main we are following the formulation of @xcite .    in standard quantum measurement schemes , for which we presume the reference frame to be classical , in order to measure the spin component @xmath0 of a particle along a direction @xmath1 we use the projections @xmath2 now the question arises : what do we mean by a classical reference frame and in which aspects it is different from a quantum mechanical reference frame ? a qrf is different from its classical counterpart in two ways .",
    "first , due to the inherent uncertainty in its direction , the measurement results are only an approximation of what would be obtained using the classical reference frame .",
    "second , each time the quantum reference frame is used , it suffers a back - action which causes the future measurements to be less accurate .",
    "we model the qrf as a spin-@xmath3 particle , the spin components described in the normal manner by an operator @xmath4 , and consider it being used to make measurements of the direction of a series of spin-1/2 particles , each described by an operator @xmath0 .",
    "a measurement of the relative orientation between the qrf and one particle is given by a measurement of @xmath5 ( the optimal measurement @xcite for determining the relative orientation ) , i.e. projection onto the @xmath6 irreps as described by projectors @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "to verify this works as an approximate measurement of the particle s spin we then calculate the partial trace over the reference , initially in a state @xmath10 , which yields povm operations corresponding to the two outcomes given by @xmath11= \\frac{1}{2}(i_{2}\\pm \\frac{4 \\<\\mathbf{l}\\ > \\cdot\\mathbf{s}+i_2}{d}).\\ ] ] note that the induced measurement on the source only depends on the expectation values of angular momentum of the reference frame , and we can write @xmath12 where @xmath13 as is clear , this induced measurement is an approximation of what we have in ( 1 ) such that as @xmath3 approaches infinity this approximation becomes more and more accurate .",
    "after the reference frame has been used to measure a source particle , it experiences a back - action that can be described as a quantum channel , or a completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map @xcite , which depends on the polarization direction of the source particles @xmath14 .",
    "note that for the moment we presume the specific measurement result obtained is ignored . to derive this map we consider @xmath15= \\tr_s[\\pi_+(\\rho\\otimes\\xi)\\pi_+ + \\pi_-(\\rho\\otimes\\xi)\\pi_-],\\ ] ]",
    "in which @xmath10 is the state of the reference frame and @xmath16 is the state of the source particle . using the expressions for @xmath17",

    "this drift tends to align the reference frame with that of the stream of polarized source particles and constitutes an equilibrium condition in the absence of depolarization effects .    to analyse the relative orientation between the qrf and the source particles we consider an orthonormal frame @xmath24 , obtained from the cartesian frame @xmath25 via a rotation , which transforms @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 for some fractional @xmath29 .",
    "here @xmath29 quantifies the polarization of the quantum reference frame , which is aligned along the direction @xmath30 .",
    "since , by symmetry , the qrf will remain in the @xmath31-@xmath19 plane , the transformation is a rotation about the @xmath32-axis and takes the form @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in @xcite",

    "after many measurements the dependence on these observables will tend to cancel on average , however for a small number of measurements their influence is of importance .",

    "for the qrf , the large transverse fluctuations in @xmath72 are affected by the projection @xmath73 and leads to a non - vanishing asymptotic rotation of the qrf .    in figure ( [ opmcompare ] )",

    "as we increase @xmath3 the set of states described by ( [ qbs ] ) becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of all states .",
    "in addition the net polarization @xmath29 of these states is generally small and this means that the analytic expressions obtained are still very approximate .",
    "it is expected that by including higher order terms that contribute to the net polarization @xmath29 , but do not contribute to the quadratic expectation values , the expression ( [ qbsangle ] ) would have greater accuracy .",
    "we leave this issue for a future investigation .",
    "single spin - qubit rotations are typically performed using an external classical field that can be considered as some large amplitude coherent state within the quantum description . in practice",
    "the finiteness of the external control field - equivalent to our reference system - means that the qubit and the field become entangled , resulting in a slightly imperfect rotation of the qubit .",
    "this was investigated for the case of a 2-level atom interacting with a single cavity mode initially in a coherent state in @xcite .",
    "our model is very similar - our reference spin is essentially starting in a large amplitude spin - coherent state .",
    "we are interested , however , in the case that it is reused multiple times for applying single qubit rotations to different qubits .",
    "as there is no other reference system it is clear the interaction hamiltonian should be rotationally invariant , that is , it should depend only on the relative orientations of the qubit and the frame .",
    "the most natural choice is to consider a coupling hamiltonian of the form @xmath98 , which , in the limit of large @xmath3 , would yield a standard single qubit unitary rotation on the spin .",
    "we consider therefore that the qrf and each incoming spin are coupled for a time @xmath99 such that the evolution takes the form @xmath100 .",
    "as already discussed , the sequential measurement of total angular momentum causes the reference frame to rotate in the @xmath31-@xmath19 plane , in other words the expectation value of the y - component of the qrf is always zero during the whole process , however we shall see the unitary interaction produces a rotation around an axis that depends on the precise duration of the interaction .",
    "first we write the unitary @xmath101 in a simpler form . for this purpose",

    "however , it should be that any auxilary background reference frame that we may introduce should not feature in the experimental considerations , and should serve only as a useful intermediate construct .",
    "_ ` information is physical ' _ , and so any meanful coordinate system must be associated with an actual physical system .    of course",
    ", one could take the view that an large background system already exists , and relative to this we have already determined the angles of inclinations of both the source particles and quantum reference frame , and hence know the value for @xmath37 .",
    "however , in this case , the goal of considering unitary corrections would then be to preserve the known state of the qrf in between measurements , as distinct from providing a reliable reference frame with which one determines the unknown relative angle with an ensemble of source particles through repeated measurements .    with a knowledge of the relative angle @xmath37",
    "we may tune the unitary interaction appropriately , using either a source particle from @xmath14 or @xmath125 , and correct sufficiently small rotations of the qrf .",
    "however , in the event of large measurement rotations , the best we can do between individual measurements would be to perform the largest allowable rotation in the required direction - numerics indicate that for the two projective outcomes @xmath162 we can always correct one outcome entirely and the other for @xmath163 .",
    "in this paper we have analysed in some detail the induced dynamics of a quantum reference frame as it is used to measure the spins of a sequence of source particles , and also used to implement unitary interactions on the source particles .",
    "we found that the average behaviour of the qrf is to gradually rotate into alignment with the source particles at an @xmath164 rate .",
    "if we pay attention to the induced dynamics subsequent to a particular measurement outcome , we find that the dynamics is not so simple and large fluctuations can exist , which depend on observables quadratic in @xmath4 .",
    "we considered the restriction to a simple class of initial states for which the dynamics depends purely on the inclination of the qrf relative to the source particles .",
    "for such states we found that fluctuations may persist even in the infinite limit , and which give non - trivial dynamics .",
    "of course in this limit there is , on average , no net rotation of the qrf .",
    "future work might include the issue of parameter - estimation on the state of the source particles . while ordinary projective measurements possess a degeneracy between the polarization of the source particles and the relative angle between the qrf and the particles , the presence of dynamics breaks this degeneracy and potentially allows a richer measurement inference .    in the ideal projective measurement case ,",
    "the measurement probabilities are given by @xmath165 , and so doing a sequence of measurements only gives us the value of @xmath166 .",
    "however , in the presence of dynamics , the reference frame responds differently to the polarization @xmath156 of the source and to the relative angle @xmath37 with the source .",
    "for example , by allowing the qrf to gradually come into alignment with the source particles the measurement pattern is eventually determined solely by @xmath156 , while the early - time outcomes encode the dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "such a separation of parameters is a result of the non - trivial dynamics of the finite quantum reference frame .",
    "it is also possible to do parameter estimation plus correction in parallel .",
    "initially we know nothing of @xmath37 and so can take it to lie uniformly between @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "however , for example , getting a string of many plus outcomes implies that the relative angle @xmath37 is quite small . each successive measurue outcome",
    "we obtain allows us to update our estimate for @xmath37 and in each case we can use our best estimate to perform a unitary correction , ideally converging in on a stable distribution and the correct value for the relative angle .    alternatively , in the event that we are ignorant of the relative angle @xmath37 it may be possible to perform a ` conditional ' corrective unitary interaction",
    "the idea is that the source particle that has been measured with the qrf encodes the relative angle between the qrf and the unmeasured particles in its new state .",
    "it may be possible to transfer this @xmath37 dependence to in a manner which improves the corrective procedures .",
