    "promising to open a new window to the universe , a new generation of laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors will soon search for gravitational radiation .",
    "the japanese instrument tama is already in operation @xcite , and the construction of the two ligo sites in the us and the european instruments geo and virgo is well advanced . among the most promising sources for these detectors",
    "are the inspiral and merger of compact binaries , i.e.  binaries of black holes and neutron stars . even for these sources",
    ", the signal strength is expected to be much less than the detectors noise , so that sophisticated data analysis techniques will be required to extract the signal from the noise ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one such technique is matched filtering , in which the detector output is cross - correlated with a catalog of theoretically predicted waveforms .",
    "the cross - correlation between a signal present in the data and a member of the catalog allows observers to detect signals that are otherwise overwhelmed by noise . clearly , the chances of detecting a generic astrophysical signal depend critically on the size and quality of the signal catalog @xcite .",
    "the success of the new gravitational wave interferometers therefore depends on accurate theoretical models of compact binary inspiral .    for our purposes",
    ", the entire inspiral of compact binaries can be separated into three different phases . by far",
    "the longest phase is the initial quasi - equilibrium _ inspiral _ phase , during which the separation between the stars decreases adiabatically as energy is carried away by gravitational radiation . as the separation decreases , the frequency and amplitude of the emitted gravitational radiation increases .",
    "since gravitational radiation tends to circularize binary orbits , and since we will be mostly interested in binaries at very small separation , it is reasonable to focus on quasi - circular orbits .",
    "these quasi - circular orbits become unstable at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , where the inspiral gradually enters a _ plunge and merger _ phase .",
    "the merger and coalescence of the stars happens on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the final stage of the evolution is the _ ringdown _ phase , during which the merged object settles down to equilibrium .",
    "different techniques are commonly employed to model the binary in the different phases .",
    "the early inspiral phase , for large binary separations , can be modeled very accurately with post - newtonian methods ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that the plunge and merger phase has to be simulated by means of a fully self - consistent numerical relativity simulation . during the late ringdown phase",
    ", the merged object can be approximated as a distorted equilibrium object , so that perturbative techniques can be applied @xcite .",
    "in addition to simulating the dynamical plunge and merger phase , numerical relativity may also be required for the late quasi - adiabatic inspiral phase , just outside of the isco , where finite - size and relativistic effects may become large enough for post - newtonian point - mass techniques to break down .",
    "a number of review articles have recently appeared on various aspects of numerical relativity , including @xcite on numerical relativity in general , @xcite on initial data , @xcite and @xcite on numerical hydrodynamics in special and general relativity , @xcite on the coalescence of binary neutron stars , @xcite on hyperbolic methods of einstein s equations , and @xcite on the generation of gravitational waves from gravitational collapse .",
    "while we will refer to these articles in many places , the perspective and focus of this article is very different .",
    "it is intended as a review of different numerical relativity approaches to the compact binary problem , and we will focus on those methods of numerical relativity that currently seem most promising for these purposes . specifically , we will only discuss the so - called cauchy approach in `` 3 + 1 '' , i.e.  three spatial dimensions ( `` 3d '' ) plus time , and we limit matter sources , if present , to perfect fluids .",
    "this means that many other promising techniques and important results of numerical relativity will not be covered , including characteristic methods , collisionless matter and scalar wave sources , critical phenomena , and results in spherical or axisymmetry .",
    "simultaneously , we will review numerical relativity approaches to the compact binary problem only , and will not discuss post - newtonian or perturbative methods .",
    "even with this fairly focused scope of our article we will omit some important aspects .",
    "perhaps most importantly , we will not cover wave extraction and boundary conditions for outer boundaries , since in most current applications in 3 + 1 these are only implemented fairly crudely .",
    "some relevant references to more rigorous treatments include @xcite .",
    "while we will cast equations into a form that is suitable for numerical implementation , we will hardly discuss numerical methods that can be used for their solution .",
    "we will similarly ignore related computer science issues , including memory and cpu requirements and computational resources on current parallel computers .",
    "some discussion of these aspects and references can be found in @xcite .    loosely speaking",
    ", this article is organized into two parts .",
    "the first part , sections  [ sec2 ] through [ sec6 ] , introduces concepts and techniques of numerical relativity , both traditional approaches and more recent developments .",
    "the second part , sections  [ sec7 ] through [ sec10 ] , reviews their applications to binary black holes and neutron stars .",
    "the first part starts by introducing the @xmath0 decomposition and the so - called adm equations in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "we will see that , like maxwell s equations , these equations separate into constraint and evolution equations . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss strategies for solving the constraint equations and the construction of initial data . in section  [ sec4 ] we will revisit the adm equations , and will show that the evolution equations can be brought into a form that is better suited for numerical integrations .",
    "before these evolution equations can be integrated , certain coordinate conditions have to be imposed , which we will discuss in section [ sec5 ] . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we review the definition of black hole horizons , and show how these horizons can be located in numerically generated spacetimes .    in the second part",
    "we discuss the construction of binary black holes and neutron stars .",
    "specifically , we review the initial data problem and evolution simulations of binary black holes in sections [ sec7 ] and [ sec8 ] and binary neutron stars in sections [ sec9 ] and [ sec10 ] .",
    "we briefly summarize in section [ sec11 ] .",
    "also included are three short appendixes .",
    "appendix [ appa ] explains our notation , appendix [ appb ] shows how the flat vector laplace operator , which is encountered in several places in this article , can be solved , and appendix [ appc ] discusses some arguments which have been made in favor or against the approximation of spatial conformal flatness .    as a last remark we would like to apologize to all those authors and colleagues whose publications",
    "we may have missed .",
    "while we have put considerable effort into being as complete as possible , without doubt we have missed some important references .",
    "we again apologize for these unintended omissions .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the arnowitt - deser - misner or `` adm '' decomposition of einstein s equations .",
    "we will state only the most important relations and results and refer to the literature for more complete and rigorous treatments .",

    "the unification of space and time into spacetime is central to general relativity and is one of its greatest aesthetic appeals . for a numerical treatment , however , and similarly for many mathematical treatments , it is more desirable to reverse this unification and recast general relativity into a so - called `` 3 + 1 '' formulation , in which a time coordinate is explicitly split from three spatial coordinates . putting it differently , the four - dimensional spacetime is `` carved up '' into a family of three - dimensional spatial `` slices '' .    in more technical terms , we assume that the spacetime @xmath1 can be foliated into a family of non - intersecting , spacelike , three - dimensional hypersurfaces @xmath2 . at least locally , these timeslices @xmath2 form level surfaces of a scalar function @xmath3 , which we will later identify with the coordinate time . the 1-form @xmath4 is obviously closed ( @xmath5 ) and has the norm @xmath6 where the _ lapse function _",
    "@xmath7 is strictly positive ( see appendix [ appa ] for a summary of our notation ) .",
    "this implies that the surfaces @xmath2 are spacelike .",
    "we now define the timelike unit normal vector @xmath8 as @xmath9 here the negative sign has been chosen so that @xmath8 points into the direction of increasing @xmath3 .",
    "the four - dimensional metric @xmath10 now induces the _ spatial metric _",
    "@xmath11 on the hypersurfaces @xmath2 .",
    "any four - dimensional tensor can now be decomposed into spatial parts , which live in the hypersurfaces @xmath2 , and timelike parts , which are normal to @xmath2 and hence aligned with @xmath8 .",
    "the spatial part can be found by contracting with the projection operator @xmath12 and the timelike part by contracting with @xmath13      it is intuitive that casting einstein s equations into a @xmath0 form will necessitate expressing the four - dimensional riemann tensor @xmath23 in terms its three - dimensional cousin @xmath24 .",
    "it is also clear , however , that the latter can not contain all the relevant information : @xmath24 is a purely spatial object ( and can be computed from spatial derivatives of the spatial metric alone ) , while @xmath23 is a spacetime creature which also contains time - derivatives of the four - dimensional metric .",
    "this missing information is expressed by a tensor called _ extrinsic curvature _ , which describes how the slice @xmath2 is embedded in the spacetime @xmath25 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature can be defined as @xmath26 note that @xmath27 is spatial and symmetric by construction .",
    "an alternative expression can be found in terms of the `` acceleration '' of normal observers @xmath28 , @xmath29 since @xmath30 , we immediately find for the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath31 in yet another equivalent expression , the extrinsic curvature can be written in terms of the lie derivative of the spatial metric along the normal vector @xmath8 @xmath32 the lie derivative in the above equation may be thought of as the geometric generalization of the partial time derivative @xmath33 .",
    "introductions to the lie derivative can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "formally , the lie derivative along a vector field @xmath34 measures by how much the changes in a tensor field along @xmath34 differ from a mere infinitesimal coordinate transformation generated by @xmath34 . for a scalar @xmath35 ,",
    "the lie derivative reduces to the partial derivative @xmath36 for a vector field @xmath37 the lie derivative is the commutator @xmath38^a,\\ ] ] and for a 1-form @xmath39 the lie derivative is given by @xmath40 it then follows that for a tensor @xmath41 of rank @xmath42 the lie derivative is @xmath43 generalization to tensors of arbitrary rank follows naturally .",
    "it is easy to verify that in all of the above expressions for the lie derivative one may replace the partial derivative with a covariant derivative , since all connection coefficients cancel each other .    equation ( [ 2_ext_curv ] ) most clearly illustrates the interpretation of @xmath27 as a time - derivative of the spatial metric .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that spatial projections of @xmath44 will involve the extrinsic curvature and its time derivative .    given its symmetry properties , @xmath44 can be projected in three different ways . projecting all four indices into @xmath2 yields , after some manipulations , _",
    "gauss equation _",
    ", @xmath45 three spatial projections and a contraction with @xmath8 yields the _ codazzi equation _",
    "@xmath46 finally , two spatial projections and two contractions with @xmath8 yield _ ricci s equation _ @xmath47 in this equation the derivative of the lapse entered through the identity @xmath48      in the last section we simply recorded geometrical identities relating the geometry of the three - dimensional hypersurfaces @xmath2 to the geometry of the embedding four - dimensional spacetime @xmath25 . according to general relativity , the geometry of the latter is governed dynamically by einstein s equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the einstein tensor and @xmath51 the stress - energy tensor .",
    "we will now take projections of einstein s equations into @xmath2 and @xmath8 and will use the gauss , codazzi and ricci equations to eliminate the four - dimensional ricci tensor @xmath52",
    ". the result will be the adm equations , which relate three - dimensional curvature quantities to projections of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "one relation that is very useful in these derivations is @xmath53 which holds for any spatial vector @xmath54 .",
    "contracting gauss equation ( [ 2_gauss ] ) twice with the spatial metric and inserting  ( [ 2_def_gamma ] ) yields @xmath55 we now define the total energy density as measured by a normal observer @xmath8 as @xmath56 and , using einstein s equation ( [ 2_einstein ] ) , find the _ hamiltonian constraint _",
    "@xmath57    we can similarly contract the codazzi equation  ( [ 2_codazzi ] ) once to find the _",
    "momenum constraint _",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 is the momentum density ( mass current ) as measured by a normal observer @xmath8 .",
    "the hamiltonian and momenum constraints are called constraint equations because they only involve spatial quantities and their spatial derivatives .",
    "they therefore have to hold on each individual spatial slice @xmath2  in fact they are the necessary and sufficient integrability conditions for the embedding of the spatial slices @xmath60 in the spacetime @xmath1 .",
    "evolution equations that describe how data @xmath61 and @xmath27 evolve in time , from one spatial slice to the next , can be found from equation ( [ 2_ext_curv ] ) and the ricci equation ( [ 2_ricci ] ) . however , the lie derivative along @xmath8 , @xmath62 , is not a natural time derivative orthogonal to the spatial slices , since @xmath8 is not dual to the surface 1-form @xmath63 , i.e.  their dot product is not unity but rather @xmath64 instead , the vector @xmath65 is dual to @xmath63 for any spatial _",
    "shift vector _ @xmath66 .",
    "the lapse @xmath7 and the shift @xmath66 together determine how the coordinates evolve from one slice @xmath2 to the next .",
    "the lapse determines how much proper time elapses between timeslices along the normal vector @xmath8 , while the shift determines by how much spatial coordinates are shifted with respect to the normal vector .",
    "the lie derivative along @xmath67 is a natural time derivative , because the duality @xmath68 implies that the integral curves of @xmath67 are naturally parametrized by @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "all ( infinitesimal ) vectors @xmath67 originating on one spatial slice @xmath69 will end on the same spatial slice @xmath70 ( unlike the corresponding vectors @xmath8 , which generally would end on different slices ) .",
    "this also implies that the lie derivative of any spatial tensor along @xmath67 is again spatial ( see , e.g. , problem 8.14 in @xcite for an illustration ) .",
    "rewriting equation  ( [ 2_ext_curv ] ) in terms of @xmath67 yields the evolution equation for the spatial metric @xmath71 the evolution equation for the extrinsic curvature can be found by combining ricci s equation  ( [ 2_ricci ] ) with einstein s equations  ( [ 2_einstein ] ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the spatial projection of the stress - energy tensor @xmath74 and @xmath75 its trace @xmath76 .",
    "while the two constraint equations  ( [ 2_ham_1 ] ) and  ( [ 2_mom_1 ] ) constrain @xmath61 and @xmath27 on every spatial slice @xmath2 , the evolution equations  ( [ 2_gdot_1 ] ) and  ( [ 2_kdot_1 ] ) describe how these quantities evolve from one slice to the next .",
    "it can be shown that the evolution equations preserve the constraint equations , meaning that if the constraints hold on one slice , they will continue to hold on later slices .",
    "this structure is very similar to that of maxwell s equations , as we will discuss in section [ sec2.4 ] .",
    "so far , we have made no assumptions about the choice of coordinates , and have expressed all quantities in a coordinate - independent way .",
    "it is quite intuitive , though , that things will simplify if we adopt a coordinate system that reflects our 3 + 1 split of spacetime . to do so ,",
    "we introduce a basis of spatial vectors @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 , see appendix [ appa ] for a summary of our notation ) that span each slice @xmath2 , so that @xmath79 .",
    "it can be shown that this condition is preserved if the spatial vectors are lie dragged along @xmath67 . as the fourth basis vector",
    "we pick @xmath80 , or , in components , @xmath81 . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "the lie derivative along @xmath67 reduces to a partial derivative with respect to @xmath3 . since @xmath82 , the covariant , spatial components of the normal vector vanish .",
    "since contractions of any spatial tensor with the normal vector are zero , this implies that the zeroth components of contravariant spatial tensors have to vanish . for the shift vector , for example , @xmath83 , so that we can write @xmath84 solving ( [ 2_t ] ) for @xmath8 then yields the contravariant components of the shift vector @xmath85 and , since @xmath86 , @xmath87 from the definition of the spatial metric ( [ 2_def_gamma ] ) we find @xmath88 . since zeroth components of contravariant , spatial tensors are zero , we also have @xmath89 .",
    "the inverse metric can therefore be expressed as @xmath90 using @xmath91 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 it is also possible to show that @xmath17 and @xmath92 are inverses @xmath93 , so that they can be used to raise and lower indices of spatial tensors . inverting  ( [ 2_cont_metric ] ) we find the components of the four - dimensional metric @xmath94 and equivalently the line element @xmath95    the entire content of a spatial tensor is encoded in its spatial components alone .",
    "we can therefore restrict the constraint and evolution equations to spatial components .",
    "moreover , since in our coordinate system the zeroth components of contravariant , spatial tensors are zero , we can also restrict all contractions to spatial components .",
    "the connection coefficients  ( [ 2_connection ] ) reduce to @xmath96 and expressing the ricci tensor  ( [ 2_riemann ] ) in terms of second derivatives of the metric yields @xmath97    with these simplifications , the hamiltonian constraint  ( [ 2_ham_1 ] ) now becomes @xmath98 the momenum constraint @xmath99 the evolution equation for the spatial metric  ( [ 2_gdot_1 ] ) @xmath100 and the evolution equation for the extrinsic curvature  ( [ 2_kdot_1 ] ) @xmath101 the shift terms in the last two equations arise from the lie derivatives @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in ( [ 2_gdot_2 ] )",

    "these equations are not yet in a form that is generally well suited for numerical implementation . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we will see that the stability properties of numerical implementations can be improved by introducing certain new auxiliary functions and rewriting the adm equations in terms of these functions .",
    "most current numerical relativity codes are based on such reformulations of the adm equation .",
    "note that the adm equations only determine the spatial metric @xmath17 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath107 , but not the lapse @xmath7 or the shift @xmath108 .",
    "the latter determine how the coordinates evolve from one timeslice to the next and reflect the coordinate freedom of general relativity .",
    "choosing coordinates that are suitable for the situation that one wishes to simulate is central to the success of the simulation . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we will discuss strategies for both choosing and numerically implementing various coordinate conditions .    for later purposes it is useful to take the traces of the evolution equations ( [ 2_gdot_2 ] ) and ( [ 2_kdot_2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath109 , we find @xmath110 for the determinant of the metric @xmath111 , and combining the hamiltonian constraint ( [ 2_ham_2 ] ) with the trace of ( [ 2_kdot_2 ] ) yields @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the covariant laplace operator associated with @xmath17 .      to discuss the structure of the adm equations it is very instructive to compare them to the equations of electrodynamics .",

    "maxwell s equations can now be rewritten as two evolution equations for @xmath122 and @xmath116 @xmath124 \\partial_t e_i & = & - d^j d_j a_i + d_i d^j a_j   - 4 \\pi j_i \\label{2_edot2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with the constraint equation ( [ 2_econst ] ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the gauge quantity @xmath125 is , like the lapse and shift in the adm equations , undetermined by the equations , and has to be chosen independently .",

    "codes the gravitational fields are computed from the evolution equations alone , while the constraint equations are typically used to monitor the quality of the numerical solution .",

    "the four new independent variables are accounted for by the lapse @xmath7 and the shift @xmath108 , which are absent from the transverse - traceless decomposition .",
    "that approach only deals with quantities intrinsic to one spatial slice @xmath2 , and hence only requires coordinates on @xmath2 .",

    "in general relativity the situation is very similar , since the ricci tensor @xmath148 ( [ 2_ricci_2 ] ) on the right hand side of equation ( [ 2_kdot_2 ] ) also contains mixed derivative terms in addition to a laplace operator acting on @xmath17 . without these mixed derivatives ,",
    "the adm equations could be written as wave equations for the components of the spatial metric and would be manifestly hyperbolic ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "this is unfortunate , since it would be desirable in many ways to deal with a hyperbolic system of equations .",
    "mathematical theorems would guarantee the existence and uniqueness of solutions , and for numerical purposes one could bring the equations into a form that allows for the application of flux - conservative schemes that have been developed and tested in other fields of computational physics , and quite in general one might feel more comfortable that numerical implementations will produce stable evolutions .",
    "these considerations suggest that it might be desirable to eliminate the mixed derivative terms . in electrodynamics ,",
    "three different approaches can be taken to eliminate the @xmath233 term : one can make a special _ gauge choice _ , one can bring maxwell s equations into an _",
    "explicitly hyperbolic _ form , or one can introduce an _",
    "auxiliary variable_. for the remainder of this section , we will briefly discuss each one of these three strategies .    the most straightforward approach is to choose a _ gauge _ such that the term @xmath233 disappears .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , in the lorentz gauge @xmath234 for which these two terms cancel in equation ( [ 4_awave ] ) , reducing it to a wave equation for the vector potential @xmath122 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is the coulomb gauge @xmath235 , which results in an elliptic equation for @xmath125 .    in general relativity",
    ", an analogous approach can be taken by choosing harmonic coordinates ( see section [ sec5.3 ] ) , which bring the equations into a manifestly hyperbolic form .",
    "this was first realized by @xcite and @xcite , and many recent hyperbolic formulations of einstein s equations are based on this gauge choice ( e.g. @xcite ) . for the purpose of numerical simulations this strategy does not seem very promising , since harmonic coordinates may not be the optimal coordinate choice for the astrophysical situation at hand ( but see @xcite , where the traditional adm approach together with harmonic coordinates and finely tuned finite differencing has been used to simulate the merger of binary neutron stars ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , harmonic coordinates may develop pathologies which could prematurely end a numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore more desirable to preserve the coordinate freedom , and to adopt a different approach to re - writing the equations .",
    "an alternative , gauge - covariant approach to bringing maxwell s equations into an _ explicitly hyperbolic _",
    "form is to take a time derivative of ( [ 4_edot2 ] ) instead of ( [ 4_adot2 ] ) , which yields @xcite @xmath236 using the constraint ( [ 4_econst ] ) we can eliminate the first term and find a wave equation for @xmath116 @xmath237 interestingly , the gauge dependent quantities @xmath122 and",

    "a large number of @xmath0 hyperbolic formulations of general relativity have been developed recently ( see the recent review article by @xcite for an extensive survey and a more complete list of references ) .",
    "the first formulations that departed from the assumption of harmonic coordinates @xcite were based on a spin - frame formalism @xcite .",

    "it is clearly beyond the scope of this article to review all of these formulations .",

    "some of these implementations showed advantages over the adm formalism ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but others also revealed additional problems .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that a particular equation in the `` einstein - ricci '' system produced an instability , which could be removed in spherical symmetry , but not in more general 3d simulations .",

    "this generalization involves the redefinition of variables and an addition of constraints , and embeds the above equations into a 12-parameter family of hyperbolic formulations .",
    "the stability properties of the system depend strongly on the choice of the free parameters , which can be understood analytically in terms of energy norm arguments @xcite .",

    "hyperbolic systems have the great advantage that their characteristic structure can be analyzed . in the system ( [ 4_cs ] ) , all characteristic fields propagate either along the light cone or normal to the spatial foliation .",

    "in addition , the conformal factor and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are evolved separately , which follows the philosophy of separating transverse from longitudinal , or radiative from non - radiative degrees of freedom ( see section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "we follow here the formulation of @xcite , which is based on that of @xcite .",
    "we start by writing the conformal factor as @xmath253 so that @xmath254 and by choosing it such that the determinant of the conformally related metric @xmath149 is unity , @xmath255 . as in equation ( [ 3_a_0 ] ) we split the trace from the extrinsic curvature and conformally rescale the traceless part @xmath168 .",

    "the properties of maximal slicing have also been studied in a simple model problem @xcite . among other things",

    "slicing is only a coordinate condition , physical results of a simulation should not be affected if the maximal slicing condition is solved only approximately .",

    "this approximate implementation of maximal slicing is sometimes referred to as `` k - driver '' @xcite and sometimes as `` approximate maximal slicing '' or ams @xcite .",

    "most elliptic solvers that one would use to solve the elliptic equation ( [ 5_ms ] ) directly also involve iterative algorithms , and in order to save computer time one could limit those to just a few iteration steps also .",

    "this result is quite surprising , since up to then it was usually assumed that such massive neutron stars collapse to black holes on a dynamical timescale .",
    "( although earlier newtonian merger calculations already foreshadowed this result ; see @xcite and references therein ) . instead , it is possible that such `` hyper - massive '' remnants are dynamically stable and collapse to black holes on a secular timescale , after some dissipative mechanism , for example viscosity or , more likely , magnetic fields , has brought the star into more uniform rotation @xcite .    both models ( i2 ) and ( i3 ) , for which the total rest mass exceeds the maximum allowed mass by 63% and 85% ( see table [ 10_table1 ] ) , form a black hole within a dynamical timescale upon merger . in figure [ fig10.3 ]",
    "we show snapshots of the density contours and velocity profiles for the more massive model ( i3 ) . in the last frame of figure [ fig10.3 ]",
    "the thick solid line denotes the location of an apparent horizon ( see section [ sec6.1 ] ) , indicating the formation of a black hole .",
    "@xcite find fairly similar results for corotational binary models .",
    "probably the most significant difference is that corotational binaries have more angular momentum in the outer parts of the binary , which leads to the formation of spiral arms during the coalescence .",
    "the spiral arms contain a few percent of the total mass , and may ultimately form a disk around the central object .    in the simulations of @xcite one of the largest limitations on the accuracy were the outer boundaries , which , because of limited computational resources , had to be imposed well within a wavelength of the gravitational radiation from the binary ( at about @xmath509 ) .",
    "this means that the waves were extracted without being in the radiation zone , which necessarily introduces error .",
    "after having gained access to a more powerful supercomputer , @xcite therefore repeated these calculations on computational grids that extend to about a gravitational wavelength .",
    "qualitatively , these improved results are very similar to their earlier ones , although the onset of black hole formation shifts to slightly smaller masses .",
    "most strongly affected by these improvements are the gravitational wave forms . in fig [ fig10.4 ]",
    ", we therefore show examples from these improved simulations for models that are similar to model ( i1 ) , leading to a differentially rotating neutron star , and model ( i2 ) , leading to a black hole .",
    "while the simulations of @xcite are pioneering , it would be desirable to confirm their findings with independent simulations with fully self - consistent codes .",
    "many aspects of the simulations could also be improved in the future , including the setup of the initial data ( eliminating the need for an artificial reduction of the angular momentum ) , the extraction of gravitational radiation , and the handling of the hydrodynamics .",
    "for example , coalescing irrotational neutron stars form a vortex sheet at the contact surface that is kelvin - helmholtz unstable on all wavelength ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "reliably simulating such sheets is quite challenging , and is likely to require more sophisticated algorithms than artificial viscosity schemes ( compare section [ sec10.1 ] , @xcite ) .",
    "lastly it should be emphasized that these simulations assume polytropic stars governed by a gamma - law equation of state , which is an idealization . in reality , a number of factors , including effects of a realistic nuclear equation of state , magnetic fields and neutrino transport , may play an important role in the coalescence of binary neutron stars .",
    "it will probably be a while until all these can be incorporated in fully dynamical and self - consistent simulations .      as we have discussed in section [ sec1 ] , it is possible that other means of modeling binary neutron stars , in particular pn point - mass techniques , break down somewhat outside of the isco , when finite - size and relativistic effects become important .",
    "it is hard to imagine that fully hydrodynamical numerical calculations would be able to follow the inspiral reliably from such a point outside of the isco through many orbital periods to the onset of instability at the isco , followed by plunge and merger .",
    "such calculations would accumulate significant amounts of numerical error and would be computational prohibitive .",
    "this leaves a gap between the regimes that pn and fully numerical calculations can model . filling this gap for the late inspiral , immediately prior to plunge",
    ", therefore requires an alternative , approximate approach ( in the case of binary black holes , this problem has been called the `` intermediate binary black hole '' problem @xcite ) .",
    "several different such approaches have been suggested @xcite .",
    "here we will focus on the `` hydro - without - hydro '' approach ( see also @xcite ) adopted by @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite , who illustrated and calibrated this approach in a scalar gravitation model problem ) .",
    "this approach approximates the binary orbit outside of the isco as circular , and treats the orbital decay as a small correction . for each binary separation , the matter distribution",
    "can then be determined independently by the quasi - equilibrium methods of section [ sec9 ] .",
    "these matter profiles , which satisfy the equations of quasi - stationary equilibrium , can then be inserted as matter sources into einstein s equations .",
    "evolving the gravitational fields yields the gravitational wave signal and luminosity , and hence the rate at which the system loses energy at each separation . combining this luminosity @xmath510 with the derivative of the binding energy @xmath25 with respect to separation @xmath131 yields the inspiral rate @xmath511 integrating this equation yields the separation as a function of time , and accordingly the entire gravitational wave train .",
    "@xcite implemented such a scheme for corotational binaries , based on the quasi - equilibrium models of @xcite ( see section [ sec9.2 ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "these results were compared with those for an irrotational sequence , based on the models of @xcite ( see section [ sec9.3 ] ) .",
    "these simulations are illustrative only due to the small outer boundary radius which necessitated gravitational read - off inside the wave zone ( compare section [ sec10.3 ] ) .",
    "however , the method is quite promising . in figure [ fig10.5 ]",
    "we show such a gravitational wavetrain for an irrotational binary .    for a given separation ,",
    "the gravitational wave luminosity @xmath510 is very similar for corotational and irrotational models , but since the binding energy of corotational models includes the spin kinetic energy of the individual stars , the absolute value of the corotational binding energy and hence @xmath512 is smaller than that of irrotational binaries . according to ( [ 10_drdt ] ) this makes @xmath513 larger , meaning that the inspiral of corotational binaries proceeds faster than that of irrotational binaries .",
    "@xcite also point out that the entire gravitational wavetrain , from the slow inspiral to the isco and the subsequent plunge and merger , can be constructed by matching results from an quasi - adiabatic approximation of the inspiral and a dynamical simulation of the coalescence .",
    "an example , showing the last 13 orbits of the inspiral together with the plunge and merger leading to black hole formation ( as obtained by @xcite ) , is shown in figure [ fig10.6 ] .",
    "a search of the recent literature reveals the impressive progress that numerical relativity and the modeling of compact binaries has made in the past few years .",
    "new formulations of the initial value problem ( section [ sec3 ] ) and the evolution equations ( section [ sec4 ] ) , new coordinate conditions and their implementations ( section [ sec5 ] ) as well as new diagnostics ( including the horizon finders described in section [ sec6 ] ) have led to several advances in the simulation of black holes and neutron stars .",
    "recent breakthroughs include initial data for binary black holes ( section [ sec7 ] ) and neutron stars ( section [ sec9 ] ) , evolution calculations for single and binary black holes ( section [ sec8 ] ) and simulations of inspiraling and merging binary neutron stars ( section [ sec10 ] ) .",
    "some results of astrophysical interest are density profiles of relativistic binary polytropes , the location of the isco in binary black holes and neutron stars , the stability properties of neutron stars in close binaries , cusp formation in irrotational binary neutron stars , the stabilizing effect of differential rotation in remnants of binary neutron star coalescence , and the first preliminary gravitational waveforms from coalescing binary neutron stars and black holes .",
    "one of the long - standing goals of numerical relativity is the simulation of the coalescence of binary black holes .",
    "while this goal has not been achieved yet , some preliminary calculations have been performed ( section [ sec8.2 ] ) . moreover , with recent progress in the evolution of single black holes ( section [ sec8.1 ] ) , the simulation of binary black holes seems much more feasible than it did only a few years ago .",
    "it is likely that most of the numerical results reported in this article will be revisited and improved .",
    "some of these possible improvements have already been discussed in the corresponding sections . for binary black hole initial data ( section [ sec7 ] )",
    "it would be desirable to gain a clearer understanding of why different approaches lead to different values of the isco .",
    "specific calculations , some of which have already been initiated , include improvements of the thin - sandwich approach of @xcite and the construction of binaries in circular orbit using kerr - schild or post - newtonian background data , which would avoid the assumption of spatial conformal flatness .",
    "avoiding this assumption may also be interesting for binary neutron star initial data ( section [ sec9 ] ) , in addition to extending sequences of irrotational binaries beyond cusp formation ( see section [ sec9.3 ] ) .",
    "the latter would provide better initial data for dynamical simulations of binary neutron star coalescence ( section [ sec10.3 ] ) , which could also be improved by using more sophisticated hydrodynamics algorithms .",
    "other future improvements will be the inclusion of more realistic nuclear equations of state , magnetic fields , and possibly neutrino transport .",
    "most of the results that we have discussed adopt the assumption of equal mass binaries , which eventually will also have to be generalized @xcite , so that the assumption of equal mass seems quite adequate . ] .",
    "almost all numerical results discussed in this article would benefit from increased accuracy , and most will need to be significantly more accurate before they can be useful in gravitational wave catalogs as discussed in section [ sec1 ] . on uniform grids , two competing sources of numerical error",
    "are finite difference errors ( due to coarse numerical grid resolution ) and the location of outer boundaries ( if they are imposed at too small a separation ) . given the available computational resources and hence the size of the computational grid that can be afforded , a more or less suitable compromise has to be chosen between grid resolution and distance to the outer boundaries . in current simulations",
    ", this compromise still leads to significant error , in particular for gravitational wave forms ( see sections [ sec10.3 ] and [ sec10.4 ] ) .",
    "two improvements may be possible : instead of uniform grids , nested grids or adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) may be employed .",
    "while such techniques have been used in many other fields of computational physics as well as in lower - dimensional numerical relativity ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , they have been used sparingly in @xmath0 numerical relativity so far ( e.g. @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", the handling of the outer boundaries and gravitational radiation extraction could be refined .",
    "some recent efforts include @xcite .",
    "future effort will also be aimed in new directions .",
    "for example , it would be very desirable to model the late inspiral of binary black holes with a quasi - adiabatic approximation , similar to the binary neutron star calculations described in section [ sec10.4 ] .",
    "lastly , we have only discussed binaries containing two black holes or two neutron stars , while black hole - neutron star binaries have so far been neglected ( but see@xcite ) .",
    "the inspiral , coalescence and merger of black hole - neutron star binaries , including the possible tidal disruption of the neutron star , seems like an extremely interesting subject and a promising source of gravitational radiation , and is likely to receive more attention in the future .    over the years",
    "we have greatly benefitted from numerous discussions with many colleagues , including andrew abrahams , greg cook , matt duez , mark scheel , masaru shibata , saul teukolsky and kip thorne .",
    "we would like to thank the visitors program in the numerical simulation of gravitational wave sources at caltech for extending their hospitality while a portion of this review was being completed .",

    ") this may lead to compact sources , which can have advantages for numerical implementations @xcite . in the approach of @xcite , on the other hand ,",
    "the source term of equation ( [ b_2a ] ) is never compact .",
    "a third approach has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "numerical implementations ( using spectral methods ) of the three approaches have been compared by @xcite .",
    "many numerical calculations , especially for the construction of initial data , assume the spatial metric to be conformally flat . simultaneously , many authors have pointed out the limitations of conformal flatness , and have argued strongly against that simplification .",
    "not all arguments have been correct , and it may be useful to briefly review those both in favor and against conformal flatness .",
    "as we have seen in section [ sec3 ] , conformal flatness greatly simplifies the initial value equations .",
    "moreover , before the initial value equations can be solved , some form of the conformally related metric has to be chosen . in some cases",
    "educated guesses can be made ( for example by choosing kerr - schild background data @xcite or by adopting a post - newtonian metric instead of a flat conformally - related background metric as suggested in section [ sec7.3 ] ) .",
    "however , in most cases it may not be clear what a better choice than conformal flatness might be .",
    "in section [ sec3 ] we found that the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gravitational fields can be identified with parts of the conformally related spatial metric and the transverse - traceless part of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "this suggests that the assumption of conformal flatness and vanishing of @xmath544 may `` minimize the gravitational radiation content '' of a spatial slice @xmath2 .",
    "this argument is not strictly true in general ; for example it does not even hold for single rotating black holes . rotating kerr black holes , for example , which are stationary and",
    "do not emit any gravitational radiation , are not conformally flat .",
    "similarly , conformally flat models of rotating black holes that are constructed in the bowen - york formalism do contain gravitational radiation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .    for rapidly rotating single neutron stars",
    "it has been shown that conformal flatness introduces an error of at most a few percent @xcite .",
    "similarly small discrepancies were found by @xcite , who compared conformally flat binary neutron star models with models constructed under different assumptions .",
    "these small deviations are not surprising , since differences between a conformally flat metric and the `` correct '' metric appear at second post - newtonian order ( e.g. @xcite ) , which are the order of a few percent for neutron stars .",
    "it is therefore quite likely that , at least for neutron stars , the error arising from the conformal flatness assumption may be less than other errors typically expected in current simulations , including finite difference errors and effects from the poor handling of the outer boundaries .",
    "* see also @xcite ) adopted the conformal flatness approximation in their simulations of binary neutron stars , and found that their neutron stars collapsed to black holes individually prior to merging . since this result was very counter - intuitive ,",
    "it was suspected that this surprising result was erroneous and an artifact caused by the assumption of conformal flatness .",
    "it was later found that these findings were indeed wrong and that they were caused by an error in the derivation of the equations @xcite and not by conformal flatness .",
    "it has been argued similarly that the disagreement between numerical @xcite and post - newtonian ( e.g. @xcite ) values for the isco of binary black holes could be caused by the assumption of conformal flatness in the numerical calculations .",
    "however , the more recent numerical calculations of @xcite achieve much better agreement with the post - newtonian results , even though they also assume conformal flatness ( also @xcite ) . as we discussed in section [ sec7.3 ] , it is more likely that the choice of initial value decomposition , which affects the transverse parts of the extrinsic curvature ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , caused the earlier discrepancies .",
    "the good agreement between the numerical results of @xcite and post - newtonian results @xcite may even suggest that the assumption of conformal flatness is quite adequate for binary black hole models , at least as long as the spin of the individual black holes is not too large .",

    "<S> numerical relativity is the most promising tool for theoretically modeling the inspiral and coalescence of neutron star and black hole binaries , which , in turn , are among the most promising sources of gravitational radiation for future detection by gravitational wave observatories . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we review numerical relativity approaches to modeling compact binaries . starting with a brief introduction to the 3 + 1 decomposition of einstein s equations , we discuss important components of numerical relativity , including the initial data problem , reformulations of einstein s equations , coordinate conditions , and strategies for locating and handling black holes on numerical grids . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on those approaches which currently seem most relevant for the compact binary problem . </S>",
    "<S> we then outline how these methods are used to model binary neutron stars and black holes , and review the current status of inspiral and coalescence simulations .    and </S>"
