    "molecular vibration signatures have been observed in conductance measurements through a variety of molecules , such as h@xmath6,@xcite and c@xmath7.@xcite furthermore , experiments performed in the kondo regime have revealed the presence of satellite peaks at finite bias which emerge together with the zero - bias anomaly in the differential conductance as a consequence of the interplay between the electron - vibration interaction and the many - body kondo state .",

    "a similar behavior is found for the first satellite peak below the fermi energy .",
    "we could not confirm that the same behavior is valid for further satellite peaks due to the lower intensity of the latter and technical limitations of the nca calculations .",
    "since the maxima of the conductance of the satellite peaks have the same temperature dependence as the kondo peak , and are scaled with almost the same kondo temperature , we conclude that the side peaks are ( broadened ) replicas of the kondo peak . as we stated in the introduction , this is not expected _ a priori _ and it would be desirable to have a physical explanation for this . we have extended the variational approach of the anderson model for the impurity spectral density below the fermi level explained in ref . to include phonons . performing perturbations at lowest order in the electron - phonon interaction @xmath51 , we find a replica at the expected position with relative intensity @xmath88 .",
    "basically , annihilation of the dot electron in the perturbed ground state leads in part ( with an amplitude @xmath89 ) to the same excited states as in the ordinary anderson model except for the fact that they contain a phonon and thus their energy is shifted by @xmath90 ( in leading order ) .",
