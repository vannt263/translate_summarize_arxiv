    "many diseases exhibit seasonal cycles in incidence data , most notably childhood diseases such as measles and rubella ( anderson and may , 1991 , dowell , 2001 ) .",
    "for such diseases , it is widely accepted that the observed cycles are linked to the timing of school terms and the subsequent increase in contact rates among the immunologically naive child population ( keeling and rohani , 2001 , stone et al .",
    "the mechanism driving the seasonal occurrence of influenza and other respiratory infections is less well understood . while increased contact rates due to indoor crowding during winter undoubtedly facilitate greater disease transmission , it is more likely a contributing factor and not the driving mechanism ( lofgren et al .",
    "seasonal influenza places a considerable burden on public health systems with annual global incidence in the range 5 - 15% of the population , resulting in up to 500,000 deaths ( stohr , 2002 ) .",
    "targeted interventions to reduce this burden could be significantly improved if the seasonal stimulus was better understood .",
    "+ the cause of seasonality must be attributed to annual changes associated with either the host or the infectious disease pathogen ( grassly and fraser , 2006 ) .",
    "in addition to increased contact rates during winter , higher transmission rates have been linked to changes in the human immune system .",
    "possible variations in human immune function have been attributed to fluctuations in melatonin secretion regulated by the annual light - dark cycles and to deficiencies in vitamin d during the winter months ( cannell et al .",
    "2008 , lofgren et al .",
    "2007 , nelson and demas , 1996 ) .",
    "experiments on mice in an environmentally controlled environment found that mice were more susceptible to infection during the winter months ( schulman and kilbourne , 1963 ) . for diseases transmitted through indirect pathways ( e.g. respiratory droplets , fomites , fungal spores , waterborne pathogens )",
    "the ability of the pathogen to survive outside of its host must play a vital role in the transmission process ( grassly and fraser , 2006 ) .",
    "this survival potential would be greatly influenced by environmental factors .",
    "early studies on the survival of the influenza virus in air indicated that pathogen survival peaks at low relative humidity and low temperatures resulting in increased viral transmission ( harper , 1961 , hemmes et al .",
    "1960 ) . experiments to study the airborne transmission of influenza among guinea pigs further supported this theory indicating that transmission among subjects peaked in cold dry air ( lowen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however , while indoor relative humidity is minimized in winter , outdoor humidity peaks .",
    "more recent studies identify absolute humidity as a more likely seasonal driver , as both indoor and outdoor absolute humidity display cyclic behavior in temperate regions that minimizes in winter ( shaman and kohn , 2009 ) .",
    "influenza virus survival increases with low absolute humidity leading to increased transmission in winter ( shaman et al .",
    "other theories for increased viral inactivation in summer consider ultraviolet radiation and air toxicity , however , little work has been undertaken to support such theories ( weber and stilianakis , 2008 ) .",
    "+ a crucial factor to consider when assessing the impact of environmental factors on seasonal transmission is the mode of disease transmission . for respiratory diseases three modes of pathogen transmission",
    "have been identified : droplet , contact and airborne transmission ( weber and stilianakis , 2008 ) .",
    "droplet transmission occurs when , following an expiratory event by an infected individual , large pathogen - carrying droplets ( diameter @xmath0 m ) are deposited directly onto the mucous membranes of a susceptible person .",
    "the direct nature of such a transmission pathway precludes a significant impact by environmental factors on either the droplet itself or its pathogen load .",
    "conversely , the contact ( through fomites or direct human - to - human contact ) and airborne ( small aerosol droplets with diameter @xmath1 m ) modes of transmission render the pathogen vulnerable to environmental conditions during prolonged periods spent external to its host organism . for the specific case of the influenza virus ,",
    "the efficiency of contact transmission is determined by the survival rate of the pathogen on solid surfaces and human skin .",
    "the high inactivation rates observed on hands can limit the occurrence of transmission via the contact route , however , a continuous supply of fomites from infected individuals could possibly counteract this ( weber and stilianakis , 2008 ) .",
    "this mode of transmission is greatly influenced by human behavior ( e.g. cough etiquette , hand washing ) and thus a seasonal variation in its impact would be difficult to quantify .",
    "airborne droplets remain exposed to the ambient environmental conditions for prolonged periods of time and could act as an important agent driving seasonal disease incidence . for respiratory diseases mediated by airborne droplets and for a spatially homogeneous distribution of susceptibles ,",
    "pathogen removal is the result of three distinct processes : gravitational settling , pathogen inactivation and inhalation ( stilianakis and drossinos , 2010 ) .",
    "environmental factors are capable of influencing the first two of these processes ( shaman and kohn , 2009 )",
    ". the gravitational settling rate of a droplet is determined from its diameter , which is influenced by evaporation effects determined by the ambient air properties .",
    "however , a review of experimental studies by shaman and kohn ( 2009 ) found that there is insufficient evidence to support such a hypothesis .",
    "they concluded that seasonal variations in environmental conditions are most likely incorporated through the pathogen inactivation term .",
    "+ the seasonality of infectious diseases is usually incorporated in deterministic models through a time dependent transmission rate .",
    "outbreaks are typically simulated using a sinusoidal function or , in the case of childhood diseases such as measles , a step function is employed to represent school terms ( grassly and fraser , 2006 , keeling and rohani , 2001 ) .",
    "models incorporating natural birth and death processes display damped oscillations towards an endemic disease state ( fisman , 2007 ) .",
    "however , if the period of the applied seasonal forcing is close to the intrinsic period of the damped oscillations then the two effects can resonate to produce large amplitude seasonal oscillations ( dushoff et al .",
    "an important consideration in any analysis of seasonal influenza is the process of antigenic drift , whereby continuous small changes in the virus requires the production of a new vaccine each year .",
    "this phenomenon can be integrated into the standard deterministic models by allowing recovered individuals to lose their acquired immunity after a specified period of time ( dushoff et al .",
    "an important factor neglected in the standard deterministic models is the mechanism driving the seasonal variation . if the theory that the impact of annual variations in environmental conditions on pathogen survival / inactivation is indeed valid then models should incorporate this phenomenon . in this paper",
    ", we present such a model . + in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we analyze a model for the spread of an infectious disease by means of an intermediate free - living pathogenic state , which is exposed to the ambient environmental conditions .",
    "this general model , applicable to a variety of free - living organisms ( e.g. viruses , bacteria , fungi , protozoa ) , was introduced by anderson and may ( 1981 ) to describe indirect disease transmission between free - living microparasites and their invertebrate hosts .",
    "variations of the basic model have been employed to describe the spread of a pathogen through a generalized environmental state ( li et al .",
    "2009 ) , the spread of a waterborne bacteria ( tien and earn , 2010 ) , bacterial and prion disease in livestock and wildlife ( nieuwhof 2009 , miller 2006 ) , and the transmission of respiratory diseases by airborne droplets ( stilianakis and drossinos , 2010 ) .",
    "the model has even been adapted to describe the spread of fungal spores in a vineyard ( burie , 2006 ) and the point release of an infectious agent ( reluga , 2004 ) .",
    "with such a wide range of applications and descriptive abilities the intrinsic characteristics of the infectious agent are a vital model component and can radically impact the dynamics .",
    "a pathogen characteristic of primary importance is its ability to survive for prolonged periods outside of its host , which is directly influenced by environmental conditions and , thus , can not be ignored in the quest to identify seasonal disease drivers .",
    "therefore , we first analyse the general model and consider its behavior for both short - lived and long - lived pathogenic states .",
    "an important outcome of this analysis is that , in the case of short - lived pathogens , a quasi - steady state exists whereby the pathogen dynamics can be described in terms of the infected population alone .",
    "this quasi - steady approximation can also be applied to an autonomous model describing seasonal outbreaks .",
    "this model is analysed in section [ sec3 ] , where we consider the consequences of a seasonal variation in the pathogen inactivation rate and how it impacts disease incidence .",
    "many infectious diseases are primarily transmitted by means of an intermediate environmental reservoir , in which free - living pathogens are capable of surviving outside of the host organism .",
    "for example , waterborne outbreaks can persist through the shedding of pathogens by an infected individual into a water source which is then ingested by a susceptible individual .",
    "similarly , respiratory diseases can be transmitted from person to person via pathogen loaded airborne droplets or fomites expelled into the environment by infected individuals during expiratory events ( e.g. coughing or sneezing ) .",
    "the efficiency of such transmission pathways will depend on the ability of the pathogen to survive in the intermediate reservoir ( e.g. air , water ) . in this section",
    "we present a generalized model for the transmission of an infection by means of such a pathogen reservoir .",
    "+ consider a closed population of @xmath2 individuals , of which @xmath3 are susceptible , @xmath4 are infected and @xmath5 are recovered .",
    "infected individuals shed pathogens into an intermediate reservoir , which are free - living ( outside of the host organism ) and can transmit infection through contact with the susceptible population , figure [ fig : pathway ] .",
    "the total number of pathogens in the reservoir is @xmath6 .",

    "infected individuals generate pathogens , with a lifespan of @xmath12 , at a rate @xmath13 .",
    "infection acquired immunity is lost after a time period of @xmath14 , with @xmath15 if immunity is permanent .",
    "the transmission rate per pathogen is @xmath16 , determined from the contact rate of a susceptible with a pathogen and the probability of such a contact causing infection .",
    "the equation describing pathogen dynamics assumes that pathogen numbers decrease exponentially for positive @xmath17 .",
    "this could be modified to describe pathogens with more complicated life cycles .",
    "the pathogen removal rate @xmath17 can be a complicated function of environmental factors , depending on the specific pathogen type and reservoir characteristics , but for now we assume it is constant .",
    "+ the general model presented here is applicable to a wide variety of diseases such as cholera and influenza in humans ( tien and earn 2010 , stilianakis and drossinos 2010 ) and footrot and chronic wasting disease in animals ( nieuwhof 2009 , miller 2006 ) . in the case of waterborne pathogens ,",
    "this model has been expanded , specifically in the case of cholera , to include dose dependent infection rates ( codeo 2001 , bertuzzo 2010 ) and a minimum infectious dose ( joh , 2009 ) . to analyse the general framework of the basic model",

    "this is readily seen by rewriting ( [ approxsol ] ) in the form @xmath185 and there is a time shift of @xmath186 between the two quantities , whereby @xmath187 achieves its peak value before @xmath17 does when @xmath188 .",
    "furthermore , the maximum of @xmath187 will not occur before the minimum of @xmath189 when @xmath190 of course , a peak in @xmath17 corresponds to the point of maximum pathogen inactivation and thus to a minimum in pathogen survival , and logically peak disease incidence should not coincide with minimal survival .",
    "therefore , a more interesting and informative quantity is the delay between minimum @xmath17 ( peak pathogen survival ) and peak disease incidence .",
    "we denote this quantity as @xmath191 and find @xmath192 where @xmath181 can be determined from ( [ shift ] ) .",
    "thus , the extent of the observed delay between peak survival and peak incidence is determined from the specific disease parameters and the period of the seasonally forced inactivation rate . + another consideration in the relative positions of the maximum incidence and inactivation is the time of pathogen introduction , corresponding to the time the first infected individual is introduced into the population .",
    "for example , pathogen introduction at the point of peak survival could have radically different dynamics to an introduction at the time of peak inactivation . to address the consequences of the introduction time we consider a seasonal variation of the form @xmath193,\\ ] ] and then investigate the dependence of our results on @xmath194 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : initialcondition ] ) implies that the infected initial condition @xmath195 may be introduced at different points during the seasonal variation of the pathogen inactivation rate .",
    "namely , the infected person(s ) at @xmath196 may be introduced in times that correspond to different pathogen inactivation rates .",
    "given equation ( [ eq : initialcondition ] ) , the calculations were repeated , and we found that the time shift @xmath197 appears in the inhomogeneous term of the differential equation ( [ xidiffeqn ] ) and the infected population then satisfies @xmath198,\\ ] ] which can be written as @xmath199 it can then be easily shown that the delay @xmath191 does not depend on @xmath194 , i.e. equation ( [ delta ] ) remains valid , even for @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , while the solution of the differential equation will invariably depend on the time of pathogen introduction , the delay between incidence @xmath4 and inactivation @xmath189 does not .",
    "as discussed in section [ applications ] , in the case of influenza we find @xmath201 and it is reasonable to neglect the natural birth process .",
    "the values of the dimensionless parameters @xmath22 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 are given by equation ( [ fluparameters ] ) .",
    "the dimensionless frequency and amplitude are defined in ( [ seasonal_dimen_params ] ) .",
    "assuming a seasonal forcing with a period of one year yields a frequency of @xmath202 .",
    "droplet removal through inhalation is negligible and @xmath147 can be approximated by the gravitational settling rate alone , for a @xmath123 m droplet this yields @xmath203/day ( robinson et al .",
    "the pathogen inactivation rate is assumed to be independent of droplet size and is taken to be @xmath204/day ( hemmes et al .",
    "1960 ) . finally , assuming a value of @xmath205 for the forcing amplitude yields @xmath206",
    "in reality , the value of @xmath149 depends on the seasonal driver ( e.g. temperature , humidity ) and its related seasonal cycle .",
    "this work merely assumes that @xmath149 is small and the chosen value determines the amplitude of the forcing term and thus the amplitude of the disease incidence .",
    "it is clear from ( [ approxsol ] ) that the delay and period of the linearised solution are not affected by the choice of @xmath149 .",
    "+            the disease incidence @xmath187 will reach its maximum before the maximal viral inactivation @xmath189 provided @xmath188 . from ( [ shift ] ) , we calculate @xmath207 , the inverse of which yields @xmath208 , where the subscript @xmath209 indicates that this angle lies in the fundamental interval @xmath210 $ ] .",
    "however , the trigonometric coefficients in ( [ xieqn ] ) are both negative and @xmath181 must lie in the third quadrant , yielding @xmath211 .",
    "it follows that @xmath212 .",
    "furthermore , the relative positions of the incidence and inactivation curves can be further restricted , by requiring the satisfaction of ( [ shiftcondition ] ) , to ensure that the maximum of @xmath187 will not occur before the minimum of @xmath189 , and this condition reduces to @xmath213 which is always satisfied by @xmath214 . + a numerical solution of the dimensionless system ( [ seasonaleqn1])-([seasonaleqn4 ] ) , showing the pathogen inactivation @xmath189 , the disease incidence @xmath4 and the solution of the linearised system @xmath187 , is shown in figure [ fig : fluseasonality ] .",
    "the maximum disease incidence clearly occurs _ before _ maximum inactivation and _ after _ minimum inactivation .",
    "the time delay between peak virus survival ( minimal @xmath17 ) and peak disease incidence is clearly visible and can be calculated from ( [ delta ] ) as @xmath215 .",
    "both curves , @xmath4 and @xmath189 , are observed to oscillate with the same period , as predicted by the linear analysis .",
    "the linearized quasi - steady solution @xmath187 , given by ( [ approxsol3 ] ) , provides a very good approximation to the solution of the full system .",
    "figure 7 displays the disease incidence for the case @xmath216 , such that the initial infected individual was introduced into the population at the point of maximum viral inactivation ( minimum survival ) . to demonstrate the independence of the delay @xmath191 on the time of viral introduction , the simulation was re - run with the infected individual introduced at the point of minimum inactivation ( maximum survival ) , i.e. @xmath217 , figure 8 .",
    "the timing of peak disease incidence changes , however the predicted delay remains constant . + a numerical solution is shown in terms of dimensional variables in figure [ fig : dimensionalplot ] , where it is assumed that the peak in disease incidence occurs in january and , for illustration purposes , we have fixed the total human population at @xmath130 million .",
    "the solution indicates that disease incidence peaks approximately three months ( @xmath218 days calculated from ( [ delta ] ) ) after the influenza virus inactivation reaches its minimum , at which time virus survival is at its peak .",
    "the magnitude of this delay is dependent on the disease parameters .",
    "the delay @xmath191 is plotted in dimensional form for varying @xmath22 in figure [ fig : vr0](b ) . as @xmath22 increases the delay decreases and the disease incidence peak occurs earlier after the peak in influenza virus survival .",
    "the amplitude of the infectious wave as a function of @xmath22 is plotted in figure [ fig : vr0](a ) .",
    "clearly , amplitude increases with increasing @xmath22 , indicating the occurrence of more severe outbreaks for large @xmath22 values .",
    "in this work we have presented a model for the transmission of an infectious disease by means of a pathogenic state capable of surviving in an environmental reservoir outside of its host organism . for a reproduction number exceeding unity , @xmath31 ,",
    "the pathogen dynamics are found to depend on the magnitude of a dimensionless number @xmath21 , which represents the ratio between the pathogen lifespan and that of an infected individual .",
    "if the duration of the infectious disease state is significantly longer than the lifespan of the pathogen ( e.g. for influenza ) , yielding @xmath35 , a rapid transient period is observed during which pathogen and infected numbers rapidly achieve a balance .",
    "thereafter , the pathogen dynamics identically follow those of the infected population . at large times",
    ", the solution approaches a stable endemic disease state , exhibiting damped oscillations as it does so .",
    "in contrast , if the pathogen is capable of surviving significantly longer than the duration of the infectious disease state ( e.g. cryptosporidium ) , yielding @xmath59 , the susceptible and infected populations first approach an intermediate state during which the pathogen number remains approximately constant .",
    "however , at large times all variables converge to a stable endemic state .",
    "+ the effect of incorporating seasonal forcing through the pathogen inactivation rate was considered for the specific case of a respiratory infection mediated by airborne pathogen - loaded droplets .",
    "a quasi - steady state approximation allows the droplet dynamics to be neglected resulting in a classic sirs model with the seasonal forcing appearing in the denominator of the transmission term .",
    "the assumption of small - amplitude seasonal forcing yields a linearized approximation to the infected population , given by ( [ approxsol2 ] ) .",
    "it was found that the infected population oscillates about the endemic disease state with an identical period to that of the seasonally forced pathogen inactivation rate and the period is independent of the duration of acquired immunity .",
    "in addition , the peak in pathogen survival ( corresponding to minimal pathogen inactivation ) was found to precede peak disease incidence .",
    "for the particular case of influenza with a reproduction number of @xmath219 , this phase shift was calculated to be approximately three months , with shorter delays observed for larger @xmath22 values , figure [ fig : vr0 ] .",
    "+ a final topic worth noting in relation to the seasonal model presented in section [ sec3 ] is the interpretation of the basic reproduction number . in the seasonal context",
    ", this no longer corresponds to the average number of secondary infections per primary infection since this value will invariably be dependent on time .",
    "attempts have been made to define @xmath22 in this context ( bacar and ait dads 2012 , grassley and fraser 2006 ) and the various attempts to derive a time - dependent expression have focused on the analysis of a time - dependent transmission term . however , in this work we attempt to tackle the issue of seasonality from a novel perspective by linking the seasonal signal to a palpable physical process . as such , the time - dependent @xmath22 would be intrinsically linked to the pathogen inactivation rate which is a complex function of environmental factors , which in turn are highly variable with geographic location . to this end ,",
    "an elaboration on the issue of time - dependence is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "+ the exact mechanism driving the seasonal occurrence of infectious diseases is uncertain .",
    "several factors undoubtedly impact the dynamics , including human behavior and pathogen survival , and many of these factors are difficult to quantify . in particular , the burden placed on health systems by seasonal influenza , and the constant threat of deadly pandemics , makes understanding the transmission mechanisms of the virus an important issue .",
    "experimental studies have identified the impact of environmental conditions on virus survival as a crucial factor .",
    "however , the primary sources of viral inactivation ( temperature , humidity , solar radiation , etc . ) have been difficult to identify , and indeed a complex combination of these sources working in unison is a likely culprit .",
    "more rigorous experimental work is needed to ascertain the primary source of the observed seasonality .",
    "our model provides an insight into how annual variations in virus inactivation can influence disease incidence and the model is sufficiently general that it can be applied to various transmission pathways .",
    "a better understanding of pathogen removal processes could provide the opportunity to develop more complex models incorporating the effect and interaction of multiple environmental factors .",
