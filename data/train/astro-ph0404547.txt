    "in spite of extensive observational / theoretical studies of the magellanic clouds , their origins remain unsolved for a long time .",
    "did they initially form as satellite galaxies of the galaxy , or did they fall into the galaxy in the course of dynamical evolution of the lgg @xcite . a more realistic hint to this problem can be presented by studies of the origin of the magellanic stream ( ms ) .",
    "tidal models have been successfully introduced to the dynamics of the galaxy - lmc - smc system for reproducing the geometrical and dynamical structure of the ms @xcite . in such models ,",
    "orbits of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) can be traced back in time over the entire past period of @xmath3 gyr : the orbital plane is approximately perpendicular to the line joining the present position of the sun and the galactic center , and they are viewed to move counterclockwise along a nearly great circle centered on @xmath4 or the galactic center .    however , the tidal model in which the magellanic clouds formed in the neighborhood of the galaxy can not explain large orbital angular momenta of the magellanic clouds around the galaxy ( see , for example , @xcite ) . according to the theory of the magellanic stream ,",
    "the apo - galactic distance of the lmc orbit is @xmath5 kpc and its transverse velocity is @xmath6100 km s@xmath7 some 10 gyr ago , implying that if the lmc mass is @xmath8 , the orbital angular momentum of the magellanic clouds @xmath9 at that time is given by @xmath10 while the spin of the galactic disk @xmath11 in flat rotation with velocity @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density of the disk , @xmath15 the thickness , and @xmath16 the outer radius . in this estimate",
    ", we assume @xmath14 and @xmath15 to be constant .",
    "since the total mass of the disk @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 , the spin of the galactic disk @xmath11 is estimated as @xmath19 if we adopt @xmath20 km s@xmath7 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 kpc .",
    "we find that the orbital angular momentum of the lmc , @xmath9 , is comparable to the spin of the galactic disk @xmath11 .",
    "it should be also born in mind that these angular momenta make a right angle against each other .",
    "they can not be explained in terms of the tidal interaction in the lgg @xcite .",
    "further it has also been widely recognized that the morphological type of dwarf galaxies near their massive parent galaxy are generally dwarf spherical or spheroidal , but that the magellanic clouds are morphologically classified as dwarf irregulars in spite of their close location to the galaxy and are exceptionally massive @xcite and gas - rich .",
    "these facts are difficult to understand only in terms of the gravitational interaction among the three - body system , the galaxy - lmc - smc",
    ". then @xcite and @xcite conducted numerical simulations of the magellanic stream by taking into account the gravitational effect of the nearby massive galaxy m31 which is approaching us with velocity of 120 km s@xmath7 if we adopt the standard rotation velocity of the lsr ( @xmath20 km s@xmath7 ) and the solar motion ( @xmath23 km s@xmath7 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) . with the orbital elements of m31 assumed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", it is found that the binary orbits of the lmc and the smc at their early times are much disturbed compared with those determined by @xcite and @xcite , but no successful result has been obtained for solving the angular momentum problem even through the four - body dynamics of the galaxy - m31-lmc - smc .    the present authors come to take a view point that some questions about the galaxy - lmc - smc system must be answered through a more - global model for the lgg in which the galaxy , the lmc and the smc should be treated as three objects among more - than - forty members of the lgg .",
    "for this reason we begin with in the next section our reexamination of the sky ( two - dimensional ) and spatial ( three - dimensional ) distributions of the member galaxies of the lgg , which would give key ideas for the dynamics and the origin of the lgg .    in concluding this section",
    ", we note that many studies have tried to determine the past orbits of the lgg members under their various assumptions .",
    "they are conducted mostly in virial scheme and , therefore , the results are rather stochastic . here",
    "we should refer to three important works by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they have pioneered the global lgg dynamics , although many basic differences are present from our ideas and results , particularly concerning the origin of the lgg .",
    "the concept of a local group of galaxies was introduced as early as at the time of hubble s distance and redshift measurements of extragalactic objects .",
    "the number of member galaxies of the local group has increased since that time and it is still so even at present . it is more than forty : see @xcite and @xcite for reviews of the lgg .",
    "figure [ fig-1 ] shows a sky distribution of the lgg members listed in the up - to - date table of @xcite .",
    "the galactic coordinates ( @xmath26 ) is adopted , but longitude / latitude grid - lines are ignored here in order to emphasize an impression that the lgg members are distributed not at random but in a somewhat systematic way forming a ring of large diameter of about 180@xmath1 .",
    "the major axis of the sky rimmed with an ellipse is the galactic plane , with @xmath27 at the both extreme ends , and the minor axis links the north and south galactic poles . the galactic center @xmath28",
    "is located at the geometrical center of this ellipse .",
    "if we exclude four dwarfs in the direction of the galactic center , sagittarius , sagdig , ngc6822 and ddo210 , the existence of the ring of @xmath29 in width appears to be more evident .",
    "the plane of the ring is perpendicular both to the galactic plane and to the line joining the present position of the sun and the galactic center .",
    "the apparently small tidal structure of the sagittarius will be discussed later .",
    "such a ring - like distribution of the lgg dwarf galaxies and the magellanic stream was already pointed out in a few previous studies until the end of the 1970s , but it is widely considered to be rather accidental with no special meanings except some studies . as will be touched upon later , @xcite claimed that the ring - like distribution of the galaxy group dwarfs is an evidence for a big dynamical event which occurred in the neighborhood of the galaxy some billion years ago and that a few dozen of proto - dwarf gaseous debris were driven to form and scatter on the plane as observed today in figure [ fig-1 ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the orbit has been determined by assuming a proper motion on the @xmath30 plane in figure [ fig-10 ] , where each symbol has the same meaning as that in figure [ fig-6 ] , but nearly radial contour - lines indicate that @xmath31 on these lines guarantee respectively same angles between the orbital plane of the draco and that of of the galaxy - m31 system .",
    "the present proper motion @xmath32 predicted for the draco in table [ tab-2 ] , is based on the orbit determined with the velocity @xmath30 at the double circle in figure [ fig-10 ] .",
    "similar orbit - surveys are carried out for the other dwarf members of the galaxy group , and the results are given in table [ tab-2 ] ; open circles and crosses given in the second and sixth columns represent respectively the existence and absence of the model - consistent orbits for the past 10.4 gyr .",
    "although these results are discussed later on the basis of more global model - picture , we can say here , at least , more than sixty percent of the galaxy group members hold @xmath33 .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , which was discovered by @xcite , is one of the four dwarfs not on the lgg ring ( see figures [ fig-1 ] and [ fig-2 ] ) but near the direction of the galactic center .",
    "it locates at only 16 kpc of the galactic center and is elongated at a right angle against the galactic plane .",
    "such elongated structure of the sagittarius is considered to represent a tidal disruption due to the galaxy and its major axis should coincide approximately with the orbit round the galaxy .",
    "thus we can estimate the orbital plane of the sagittarius by tracing its major axis and the galactic center @xcite . using the estimated orbital plane together with the data in table [ tab-1 ] and our model conditions for the lgg origin ,",
    "we have computed the model orbit of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , and obtained the result of @xmath33 and the prediction for proper motion in the ( l , b ) directions in table [ tab-2 ] .",
    "it is qualitatively consistent with that given in @xcite .",
    "next we searched for model - fitting orbits of the m31 group dwarfs in the same way as in cases of the galaxy group .",
    "two orbits of ngc185 and ngc205 thus obtained are presented in figure [ fig-11 ] over their lifetime of 10.4 gyr .",
    "they are actually confined within the flat disk of finite thickness ( figure [ fig-3 ] ) , and fulfill our model conditions that they pass the formation site exactly 10.4 gyr ago .",
    "fourteen dwarf galaxies out of thirty nine members ( table [ tab-1 ] ) belong neither to the galaxy nor to m31 , but are located just like linking these two massive galaxies ( figure [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "one of them , pegasus , has orbit that follows our model scenario",
    ". a particular interest may also be in examining whether or not our model orbits of ngc205 and m32 are consistent with those determined by @xcite and @xcite who claimed that the warp of hydrogen gas distribution at the outer parts of m31 and the peculiar motion of hydrogen gas near the center of m31 are due to the tidal interaction with ngc205 and m32 , respectively . according to @xcite the orbital plane of ngc205 makes a large angle of @xmath34 against the m31 disk and the direction of motion",
    "is counterclockwise seen from ( l , b)@xmath35 .",
    "these orbit features are consistent with in figure [ fig-11 ] .",
    "similarly , the orbital plane of m32 makes a medium angle against the m31 disk and the sense of revolution around m31 @xcite are consistent with that inferred from the kinematics of our off - center collision between m31 and the galaxy .",
    "we mention that the model orbits for these two galaxies are determined easily , because ngc205 and m32 are so close to m31 , 20 to 40 kpc from its center , and , therefore , they are located already deep within the lgg disk of 50 to 100 kpc thickness .",
    "since the scale of the formation site of @xmath36 kpc is much larger than the above mentioned 20 to 40 kpc , we can choose their suitable proper motion in considerably wide ranges of the @xmath37 diagram as in figure [ fig-10 ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite determined the orbit of m32 by use of the data of stellar streaming in m31 .",
    "it is shown easily to be consistent with our model orbit . at present , however , we do not have enough data to conclude which is more agreeable to our model , byrd s orbit @xcite or ibata s one @xcite .",
    "again we give in table [ tab-2 ] the results , @xmath33 and @xmath38 , for our orbit search for the members of the m31 group , together with the results for the nongroup members .",
    "finally we show in figures [ fig-12 ] and [ fig-13 ] all orbits of the members of the lgg with @xmath33 in table [ tab-2 ] : figure [ fig-12 ] gives a face - on view seen from the direction of @xmath39 while figure [ fig-13 ] an approximately edge - on view from the direction of @xmath40 .",
    "although the orbits are much tangled each other and it is very hard to derive their detailed numerical data , we can see globally that the lgg dwarf galaxies are driven to form by the ancient off - center collision between m31 and the galaxy , and that they evolve dynamically on the orbital plane of these two massive galaxies .",
    "we have made a hydrodynamical model for the origin of the orbital angular momentum of the magellanic cloud system , and also for the hydrodynamically - driven formation of the dwarf members of the lgg .",
    "if our model is realistic , the orbits of the lgg members and their formation sites can be determined theoretically .",
    "however , we still have some problems that should be discussed from the viewpoint of the present model .      at the close passage of m31 at @xmath0150 kpc from the galactic center ( figure [ fig-5](a ) ) , the tidal torque @xmath41 works on the disk , which could spin it up in the same direction as that of the orbital angular momentum of the magellanic cloud system about the galaxy .",
    "it is perpendicular to the present disk of the galaxy .",
    "this dynamics should be exert the same effect on the disk of m31 , too .",
    "the gravitational torque is the monopole - quadruple moment interaction .",
    "that is , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the mass of the nearby passing galaxy and @xmath44 is the impact parameter or the distance of the perigalacticon .",
    "note that @xmath41 is not proportional to @xmath45 but to @xmath46 .",
    "we can estimate how much a spin has been given to the galactic disk through the off - center collision with m31 .",
    "here we use conveniently the dynamics of the warping of hydrogen gas disk of the galaxy that was modeled theoretically by the close approach of the magellanic cloud system at @xmath015 kpc of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the torque , @xmath47 due to the lmc , is , @xmath48 in the same way , the torque due to m31 , @xmath49 , is represented as , @xmath50 the ratio of @xmath49 to @xmath47 is , @xmath51    the angular momentum of the warp of hydrogen gas is known to be only a small fraction of that of the disk , and it is negligibly small for the inner disk of 8 kpc in radius . thus the ratio in equation ( [ eq-17 ] )",
    "indicates that the torque due to m31 , @xmath49 , is smaller than @xmath47 , or our off - center collision between m31 and the galaxy is not large to spin up the disk so that it becomes parallel to the orbital plane of the galaxy - m31 system .",
    "even if we take into account the duration of these torques , the spin of the disk is still small , only comparable to that of the observed warping of the disk @xcite .",
    "the ratio in equation ( [ eq-17 ] ) has been obtained for the disk whose radius was @xmath015 kpc at the time of the off - center collision .",
    "if such a radius of the early disk was @xmath52 kpc , the magnitude of the quadruple moment becomes five times and , therefore , the ratio in equation ( [ eq-17 ] ) is roughly unity , @xmath53 the gain of the angular momenta was still small for the early large galactic disk .",
    "again it would be only comparable to that of the present - day warp of the hydrogen disk .",
    "we can thus infer from these data that the orbital angular momentum of the magellanic cloud system and the spin of the galactic disk are of the different origin .",
    "these arguments may reflect the fact that the galactic disk and the m31 disk are observed not parallel on the plane of the sky but make an angle of about 60@xmath1 against each other .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented a tidal model that the gravitational torque due to the nearby passing m31 can spin up the disk of the galaxy .",
    "however , the model parameter values and basic assumptions adopted there are very different from those used in this study : the epoch of the interaction between the galaxy and m31 is 12 - 13 gyr ago ; the m31 s orbit is straight , passing by the galaxy and changing its direction in the neighborhood ; the proto - galaxy is already in an elongated flat disk with 100 kpc length directed towards m31 .",
    "some of the lgg dwarfs have large amounts of dark matter , inferred from their high mass - to - light ratios of draco , sextans and ulsa minor @xcite , although it is still uncertain that many other dwarfs do not have dark matter .",
    "the present model for the lgg origin gives no answer to the question ; why dark matter is not distributed equitably to all dwarf members of the lgg .",
    "we present here a possible explanation by using figure 14 in which halo models of the proto - galaxy and proto - andromeda are given at the time just before encountering or grazing each other ( figure [ fig-5](a ) ) , with a relative velocity of @xmath54 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the halo comprises baryonic matter clouds and dark matter clouds , some of which occupy the same space while others do not .",
    "the mean random velocity of the clouds is @xmath55 km s@xmath7 , resembling the unorganized motion in the gravitational potential of isothermal mass distribution .        from figures 14 and [ fig-5](a )",
    ", we can suppose various types of collisions between these clouds .",
    "for example , the baryonic gas clouds 1 and @xmath56 would collide to condense together leading to the formation of a small mass galaxy , or dwarf galaxy with only a small amount of dark matter .",
    "another example is a high velocity collision of dark matter clouds , 2 and @xmath57 , in the galaxy halo and the m31 halo , respectively .",
    "they would penetrate each other without generating a dark matter clump .",
    "when the colliding velocity is small like between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , or between a baryonic and dark matter clouds , the two - stream instability occurs to form a gravitating matter clump or a dwarf galaxy with a large amount of dark matter .",
    "the following dispersion relation given in @xcite would be convenient for these analyses , @xmath60^{1/2 } } \\lambda _ { \\rm jd}.\\ ] ] here @xmath61 is the sound velocity in the baryonic gas which has the density of @xmath62 and streams with velocity of @xmath63 relative to the dark matter whose density is @xmath64 and velocity dispersion is @xmath65 .",
    "the dark matter has a jeans length given by @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath63 is large , the collision would disperse the baryonic and dark matter clumps , resulting in neither condensation nor formation of small mass galaxies .",
    "we can assume other various collisions such as multiple ones , @xmath58 , @xmath67 and @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , it is not so unrealistic that the dwarf member of the lgg is a mixture of baryonic and dark matters in various ratios .",
    "this dark matter model , shown schematically in figures 14 and [ fig-5](a ) , is , of course , _ ad hoc _ and far from conclusive , remaining very open to further investigations .",
    "on the bases of the ring - like distributions of the local group of galaxies and the magellanic stream on the plane of sky ( seen in the two - dimensional space ) , and of their coplanar distribution seen also in the three - dimensional space , we have proposed a dynamical model for the origin and evolution of the dwarf members of the lgg : the primordial dwarfs , the primordial lmc and smc as well , were driven to form in the high density region of gas generated hydrodynamically by the off - center collision between the primordial gas - rich m31 and the primordial gas - rich galaxy some 10 gyr ago .",
    "newborn dwarf galaxies are scattered on the orbital plane of these two massive galaxies and they are trapped either to the potential well of the galaxy or to that of m31 , while other some number of dwarfs are left behind from such trappings .",
    "the latter objects are observed as if linking the galaxy and m31 groups .    the orbital motion of m31 ( relative to the galaxy )",
    "is determined so that it successfully reproduces the well - studied dynamics and history of the lmc / smc system .",
    "the most important model scenario is that the lmc / smc are born from the high - density gas of the formation site , together with other dwarf members of the lgg simultaneously .",
    "thus the orbital plane of m31 must be parallel to that of the lmc / smc , roughly normal to the line joining the present position of the sun and the galactic center .",
    "both m31 and the lmc / smc revolve round the galaxy counterclockwise seen from the sun , on the unclosed elliptical orbit .",
    "thus we could have an answer to a long - standing question what the origin of the lmc / smc system is and where their large orbital angular momenta come from .",
    "moreover interestingly , we could identify the birth places of m31 and the lmc / smc on the sky and in the space , if precise age of the universe is given .",
    "we are unable to demonstrate theoretically the validity of our dynamical model only from the data about the dwarf members : their positions on the sky @xmath68 , radial velocities and radial distances measured from the galactic center .",
    "therefore , instead , we have searched for the dwarf members past orbits that follow the model scenario .",
    "figures [ fig-12 ] and [ fig-13 ] can actually show that the dwarf members start from their common formation site , move on the orbital plane ( figure [ fig-13 ] ) , and arrive at the present positions , reproducing the ring - like distribution in figures [ fig-3 ] and [ fig-4 ] .",
    "the dwarf members marked with @xmath69 in table [ tab-2 ] do not have their orbits that can be traced back in time to the formation site in our model scenario .",
    "they could be objects that plunged into the spherical lgg region from outside , or their orbits have been bent gravitationally by other nearby massive galaxies .",
    "we could also consider that these objects are intrinsic dwarfs born directly from the expanding universe and left behind from their merger to m31 and/or to the galaxy , although we have again a question why such cosmologically early - formed objects tend to gather in the lgg disk .",
    "on the other hand , if we relax our model conditions in such a way that the lgg dwarfs are formed due also to the tidal disturbance in gas around m31 and the galaxy , then the formation site depicted in figure [ fig-5](a ) would be largely extended on their orbital plane .",
    "see a recent hst picture and its caption for dwarf formation in the stepfan s quintet @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath33 in table [ tab-2 ] will increase , although it becomes difficult to predict the dwarfs proper motions .",
    "a small mass spiral , m33 , has been treated as a test - particle in determining the orbits of the lgg members .",
    "it is , of course , not correct in a sense that the mass of m33 is three to four times as large as that of the lmc / smc system .",
    "it is necessary to join this spiral to our four - body problem , but we do not yet have a key phenomenon and/or theory how to include m33 in a new five - body dynamics of the galaxy - m31-m33-lmc - smc in the lgg region",
    ". a fragmentary chain of hydrogen gas is observed as if bridging m33 and m31 @xcite , and this may be usable to determine the m33 orbit .",
    "however , we remain open to a conclusion if it is in the same category as the magellanic stream . even if the gravity of m33 is taken into account , however , we believe that our conclusions do not change so significantly , because the total mass of the galaxy and m31 dominates that of all other members and control them gravitationally .",
    "we did not use the data about the tidal - cut - off radii of the lgg dwarfs , because , as figures [ fig-12 ] and [ fig-13 ] show , they could be located close to the galaxy , or m31 or to both before they become condensed to dwarf galaxies . even if the pericenter distance of a dwarf s orbit is calculated formally from the tidal - cut - off - radii data",
    ", we can not know what it means in our lgg model .",
    "@xcite found a group of metal - poor star - clusters ( counted as seven at the moment ) and showed that these clusters align on the plane perpendicular to the line joining the present position of the sun and the galactic center , in quite a similar way to that discussed about the lgg members in figures [ fig-1 ] and [ fig-2 ] . as they suggest , if these metal - poor clusters were born originally in the lmc and have been captured recently to the galaxy , some of the globular clusters in the galactic halo are regarded as tightly related to the lgg dynamics that the lmc was driven to form at the off - center collision between m31 and the galaxy .",
    "we have pursued backward in time m31 and the lmc / smc in an expanding flat universe .",
    "when the present model proves to be realistic and is improved to be more quantitative , we must reexamine various parameters applied so far .",
    "for example , a claim may be made that the lifetime of 10.4 gyr for the lgg model is a little too small and @xmath70 gyr more suitable .",
    "the former age has been obtained by use of the masses of the galaxy and m31 which are applied uniformly in their series of papers by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . however ,",
    "if we take a - little - less masses for the galaxy @xcite and m31 , or their smaller radii of dark matter halos , it is possible that the latter age is more reasonable . at present , however , we must wait for a moment to conclude which is more realistic and more contribute to understanding the origin and evolution of the lgg .",
    "we have only briefly touched upon some problems such as the tidal effect on the disks of the galaxy and m31 , the dark matter mass - fraction among the lgg dwarfs , and etc .",
    "the extensive studies on these problems would contribute to obtaining new hints to improve and develop more realistically our lgg model .",
    "we would like to thank professor y. kumai for his critical comments and discussions about the present work , and one of us ( m.f ) deeply thanks vice - president of nagoya university k. yamashita for his hospitality and research support during my stay at his u - lab .",

    "<S> we propose a new model for the origin and evolution of the local group of galaxies ( lgg ) which naturally explains the formation of the magellanic clouds and their large orbital angular momenta around the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is that an off - center hydrodynamical collision occurred some 10 gyr ago between the primordial gas - rich andromeda galaxy and the similar galaxy , and compressed the halo gas to form the lgg dwarf galaxies including the magellanic clouds . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , new - born dwarf galaxies can be expected to locate near the orbital plane of these two massive galaxies . in order to see the reality of this model , we reexamine the two - dimensional sky distribution of the lgg members and the magellanic stream </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm an earlier and widely - discussed idea that they align along two similar great circles , each with an angular width of @xmath030@xmath1 , and the planes of these circles are approximately normal to the line joining the present position of the sun and the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> further we make a three - dimensional distribution map of these objects , and observe it from various directions . </S>",
    "<S> a well - defined plane of finite thickness is found , within which most of the member galaxies are confined , supporting the existence of the above circles on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> thus we could determine the orbital elements of m31 relative to the galaxy through reproducing the well - studied dynamics of the lmc and the smc around the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the expected proper motion of m31 is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> probable orbital motions of the other dwarfs are also determined , and the corresponding proper motion for each object is given to compare with observations in near future . </S>"
