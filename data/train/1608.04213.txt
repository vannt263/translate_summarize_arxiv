    "radio frequency spectrum has recently become a scarce and expensive wireless resource due to the ever increasing demand of multimedia services .",
    "nevertheless , it has been reported in @xcite that the majority of licensed users are idle at any given time and location . to significantly improve spectrum utilization , cognitive radio ( cr )",
    "is widely considered as a promising approach .",
    "there are two famous cr models , namely opportunistic spectrum access model and spectrum sharing model . in the former ,",
    "the secondary users ( sus , unlicensed users ) are allowed to use the frequency bands of the primary users ( pus , licensed users ) only when these bands are not occupied @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the pus have prioritized access to the available radio spectrum , while the sus have restricted access and need to avoid causing detrimental interference to the primary receivers @xcite . towards this end ,",
    "several powerful techniques such as spectrum sensing and beamforming design , have been used to protect the pus from the interference from the sus and to meet quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that transmit beamforming has enormous potential to improve the capacity of wireless communication systems without requiring extra bandwidth or transmit power .",
    "in fact , a popular method to control the interference that has been widely used in the literature is based on zero - forcing ( zf ) technique , which places null spaces at the beamforming vector of each co - channel receiver .",
    "specifically , successive zero - forcing dirty paper coding ( szf - dpc ) was introduced in @xcite for single - antenna receivers and was extended to multiple - antenna receivers in @xcite .",
    "inspired by these two works , the authors in @xcite proposed efficient numerical methods based on a barrier method to solve the throughput maximization problem .",
    "these approaches were shown to have a superior convergence behavior compared to a two - stage iterative method based on the dual subgradient method @xcite .",
    "the throughput maximization of a cr network was optimally solved in @xcite , which considered a single secondary multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo)/multiple - input single - output ( miso ) link under the constraint of opportunistic spectrum sharing .",
    "multiple antennas are exploited at the secondary transmitter to optimally trade off between attaining the maximal throughput and meeting the interference threshold at the primary receivers .",
    "the throughput of the su link was studied with instantaneous or average interference - power constraint at a single pu in @xcite . when multiple sus access a single - frequency which is licensed to one pu , a qos constraint for each secondary link is solved efficiently using a geometric programming method under the interference - power constraint at some measured point @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered maximizing the smallest weighted rate and proposed distributed algorithms for optimal beamforming and rate allocation .",
    "the channel capacity of cr networks with two users was presented in @xcite , where the cognitive user is assumed to know the message of the primary user non - causally prior to transmissions .",
    "the impact of average interference power and peak interference power constraints on the ergodic capacity of cr networks was compared in @xcite . in @xcite , an enhanced spectrum sensing scheme was proposed to improve the optimal power allocation strategy in cr networks . in parallel lines ,",
    "beamforming design technique was applied to control the total amount of interference caused by the secondary transmitter , thereby enhancing the channel capacity of cr mimo networks @xcite",
    ".    the sum rate ( sr ) maximization problem of cr has been a classical one in wireless system design @xcite . in particular , the authors in @xcite considered the weighted sum rate ( wsr ) maximization problem for cr multiple - sus mimo broadcast channel ( bc ) under the sum power constraint and the interference power constraints .",
    "the problem is shown to be a nonconvex problem but can be transformed into an equivalent convex cr mimo multiple access channel ( mac ) problem via the general bc - mac duality result .",
    "the problem of wsr maximization for multiple miso sus in the presence of multiple primary receivers was addressed in @xcite , where an iterative algorithm based on the subgradient method was proposed to determine the beamforming vectors . for the mimo ad hoc cr network considered in @xcite , a semidistributed algorithm and a centralized algorithm based on geometric programming and network duality",
    "were introduced under the interference constraint at the primary receivers in order to obtain a locally optimal linear precoder for the non - convex wsr maximization problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated a cr multiple - antenna two - way relay network , where optimal relay beamforming and suboptimal beamforming vectors were obtained based on the subspace projection and power control algorithms that are proposed to satisfy the power budget as well as the interference power constraints .",
    "however , all of these algorithms generally have high computational complexity and slow convergence .",
    "very recently , the sr maximization for cr miso - bc with a very large number of antennas at the secondary transmitter was studied in @xcite . for the general case ,",
    "a low - complexity suboptimal beamforming scheme based on partially - projected regularized zf beamforming was applied to obtain a closed - form beamformer , and then deterministic approximations for large system analysis were also derived .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied a wsr maximization problem with a collection of multiple pus and sus sharing a common frequency - flat fading channel . under the interference power and",
    "transmit power constraint , a reformulation - relaxation technique was proposed to solve a convex optimization problem over a closed bounded convex set in the rate domain to bound the optimal value , and a branch - and - bound algorithm is used to find a globally optimal solution to the wsr maximization problem .",
    "most of prior research on beamforming design for cr networks assumed that single antenna is employed at either both the primary and secondary receivers or the primary receiver . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the sr maximization problem in more general cases for cr mimo - bc networks in the presence of multiple sus and pus is still an open research and has not been investigated previously .    in this paper",
    "we consider a cr network where the secondary system consisting of a multiantenna bs sends data to multiple users on its downlink channel while satisfying the interference limit that it may cause to the legitimate users of the primary system .",
    "we note that the capacity of the downlink transmission of the secondary system can be achieved through dpc @xcite .",
    "however , dpc is difficult to implement in practice since it is a nonlinear precoding technique with high implementation complexity . in this paper",
    "we adopt zf precoding which has been widely used in the literature thanks to its simplicity and effectiveness at the secondary base station ( bs ) , and consider the sr maximization problem subject to per - antenna power constraints ( papc ) at secondary bs and the interference power constraint at pus . by a standard rank relaxation method",
    ", the precoder design problem can be cast as a semidefinite program which can be solved by generic conic solvers such as sedumi @xcite or sdpt3 @xcite .",
    "however , we do not follow such approach for the following two reasons .",
    "first , it provides little useful insights into the structure of the optimal precoder .",
    "second , its computational complexity is generally very high since specifications of the considered problem are not exploited . in this paper ,",
    "our contributions include the followings    * we reformulate the sr maximization problem for the considered cr mimo system subject to papcs and interference constraints into a concave - convex ( also known as minimax ) program by extending a bc - mac duality result . to do this we first apply a standard rank relaxation method and then prove that the relaxation is tight .",
    "in particular , we show that the papcs and interference constraints will become equality constraints in the derived convex - concave program . *",
    "we customize the barrier method to find a saddle point ( i.e. , an optimal solution ) of the convex - concave program .",
    "the proposed algorithm is basically an iterative newton - type method which is customized to exploit the special features of the design problem .",
    "explicitly , in each iteration to find the newton step , we arrive at a system of sylvester equations which is less complex to solve , compared to a generic method based on solving a system of linear equations . * we provide extensive numerical results to justify the novelty of the algorithm and compare its performance with suboptimal solutions . in particular , the numerical results demonstrate a superlinear convergence rate of the proposed algorithm and superior performance on achievable sum rate over the suboptimal solutions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "system model and the formulation of the sr maximization problem are described in section [ systemmodel ] . in section [ proposedalgorithm ]",

    "the secondary system is allowed to share the same spectrum band licensed to the primary system . in an underlay cognitive network",

    "the numbers of receive antennas at the @xmath27th su and the @xmath24th pu are denoted by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and their channel matrices ( to the secondary bs ) are represented by @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath32 and @xmath33 remains constant during a transmission block and change independently from one block to another .",
    "we further assume that the channel matrices can be perfectly known at the secondary bs , using a genie added feedback .",
    "though this assumption is quite ideal , it has been considered in @xcite to study their problems of interest in the context of cr networks . in reality ,",
    "perfect channel estimation is hardly achieved and thus the results obtained in this paper may act as an upper bound on the sr performance for the secondary transmission in an underlay cr network .    in the considered system ,",
    "linear precoding is employed at the secondary bs to transmit data to the sus .",
    "specifically , the vector of transmitted symbols of the @xmath27th su , denoted by @xmath34 , is multiplied by the precoder @xmath35 , @xmath36 , before being transmitted .",

    ", we need to design @xmath42 such that @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , the problem of sr maximization for cognitive transmission is mathematically formulated as    rcl [ eq : bd : sumrate : papc ] & & _ k=1^k|+_k_k_k^h_k^h| [ eq : obj:2 ] + & & _ k_j=,jk[eq : zfcondi ] + & & _ k=1^k[_k_k^h]_n , np_n , n[eq : papc ] + & & _ k=1^k(_m_k_k^h_m^h)i_m , m[eq : threshold ]    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . here , the constraint in is the power constraints for the @xmath13th antenna at the secondary bs .",
    "we remark that an antenna is often equipped with its own power amplifier ( pa ) .",
    "thus , we may need to limit the maximum transmit power on each antenna for it to operate within the linear region of the pa , which is more power efficient @xcite .",
    "the per - antenna power constraints ( papcs ) in different from those considered in @xcite , but we note that the proposed solution introduced in this paper also applies to the sum power constraint ( spc ) after slight modifications .",
    "this will be elaborated in the appendix .",
    "in fact the interference from the secondary bs to a particular pu is a matrix , which is non - degrading .",
    "this is different from the case of pus with single antenna in which the interference is a scalar , referred to as interference temperature @xcite .",
    "the constraints in indicate that the sum of all eigenvalues of the resulting interference matrix should be less than a predetermined interference threshold @xmath25 at the @xmath24th pu . we can rewrite as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the channel from the secondary bs to the @xmath8th receive antenna of the @xmath24th pu . we note that the term @xmath49 represents the interference temperature at the @xmath8th antenna of the @xmath24th pu . in this way , implies that the sum of the interference temperatures of all antennas at the @xmath24th pu should be smaller than or equal to a predetermined threshold .",
    "there are possibly other ways to control the interference generated by the secondary system .",
    "for example , we may force the maximum eigenvalue or the determinant ( equivalent to the product of eigenvalues ) of the interference matrix to be smaller than a threshold .",
    "we remark that all these ways of controlling the interference term are the same for single - antenna pus .    to further simplify , let @xmath50^{t}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{(n_{r}-n_{k})\\times n},$ ] where @xmath51 is the total number of receive antennas .",
    "the condition for to be feasible is that @xmath52 has a dimension larger than zero , i.e. , @xmath53 , for all @xmath27 . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the problem design in is feasible , which can be met when @xmath54 and the channel matrices of the sus and pus have sufficiently low correlation degree .",
    "let @xmath55 be the null space of @xmath56 , then @xmath57 is a basis of @xmath52 , where @xmath58 .",

    "moreover , we will solve through a bc - mac duality , in contrast to dealing with the primal domain as done in @xcite . towards this end",
    "we consider the following problem .",

    "we will prove shortly that the optimal solutions of the relaxed problem must satisfy the rank constraints in , meaning that the rank relaxation is tight .",
    "thus , from now onwards , we will consider the relaxed problem of in the sequel of the paper , instead of in the original form .    to solve the relaxed problem of ,",
    "we can modify the method presented in @xcite which is based on the subgradient method .",
    "however , subgradient methods generally converge very slow in practice .",
    "herein we propose an efficient method to solve it using a barrier method which is known to have superlinear convergence property .",

    "* section 10.3.4 ) , thereby showing the structure of the optimal precoder @xmath64 .",
    "we then propose a numerical algorithm to solve the convex - concave problem by customizing interior - point methods to find a saddle point ( i.e. , an optimal solution ) .",
    "the development of the proposed algorithm is particularly based on the following theorem .",

    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower ] , decreasing the interference threshold @xmath240 degrades the system performance .",
    "the performance gains achieved for higher interference threshold are due to the fact that more transmit power can be used when the interference threshold constraints are set to a higher value",
    ". specifically , the srs of the secondary system with different levels of the interference threshold constraint are of the same order in the low transmit power regime .",
    "the reason is that the considered interference thresholds still allow the secondary system to operate with nearly full transmit power .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : pu ] depicts the impact of the number of pus on the performance of the cognitive network .",
    "we can see that the average sr of secondary system is degraded as the number of pus @xmath23 increases , and the degradation is dramatic for large transmit power at the secondary bs .",
    "for low power regime , the secondary bs mainly focuses on maximizing the sr of the secondary system and pays little attention to the primary system since the interference constraints are likely satisfied for all pus .",
    "accordingly , the srs are quite similar in such cases for different numbers of pus as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : pu ] .",
    "as the transmit power becomes sufficiently large , the bs needs to avoid transmitting its signals over the spatial space of pus . in this case , the degree of freedom left for the secondary system is reduced if the number of pus increases , and this explains the noticeable differences of srs for large numbers of pus .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : n - m ] , we consider the case of a single pu ( i.e. , @xmath243 ) and examine the impact of the number of antennas at the pu on the performance of the secondary system .",
    "all the remaining parameters are set to the same values as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : pu ] .",
    "similarly , it is observed that increasing the number of antennas at the pu severely deteriorates the average sr of the secondary performance , especially for large transmit power at the bs .",
    "we can intuitively explain this observation by simply treating each transmit antenna of the pu as a single pu and recalling the discussions presented for fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : pu ] .",
    "in the next numerical example , we plot the average sr versus the number of transmit antennas and versus the transmit power at the secondary bs in fig . [",
    "fig : sumrate : transmitpower : n](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : n](b ) , respectively .",
    "as expected , the average sr improves as the number of transmit antennas increases since more degrees of freedom are added to the secondary system . a large interference threshold ( i.e. , @xmath240 = 10 db in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : n](a ) ) allows the secondary system to fully exploit the available degrees of freedom .",
    "in such a case , more sus result in more multiuser diversity in the secondary system , which accordingly increases the average sr . on the other hand , for a small interference threshold in both the fig . [",
    "fig : sumrate : transmitpower : n](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : n](b ) , the average sr first decreases for small @xmath21 and then increases for large @xmath21 when more sus are served .",
    "another interesting point is that the gap between the curves is reduced , as the number of antennas at the secondary bs increases .",
    "we recall that for small @xmath21 and small interference threshold , the secondary system lacks degree of freedom for leveraging multiuser diversity .",
    "as mentioned earlier , interference from the secondary bs to a pu is a matrix which is non - degrading and there are possibly several ways to control the interference .",
    "thus it is very interesting to investigate how different types of interference constraints affect the performance of the primary system . in this numerical experiment",
    ", we consider a primary system where the primary bs is equipped with @xmath244 antennas and employs zf precoding with papcs @xcite .",
    "the interference from the secondary system is simply treated as background thermal noise at the pus . under this setup",
    ", we plot the average achieved sr of the primary system for two different types of interference constraints , one considered in this paper shown in and the other obtained by replacing with @xmath245 . in other words",
    ", we impose that the largest eigenvalue of the interference matrix should be smaller than a predetermined threshold . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : pusystem ] , the primary system achieves a higher sr with the sum of all eigenvalues than with the largest eigenvalue of the interference matrix .",
    "this implies that the new type of interference constraint is stricter than our considered one .",
    "the gaps between the two schemes are negligible for small number of receive antennas at the pus ( i.e. , @xmath242 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : pusystem ] ) .",
    "the reason is that in such cases the number of eigenvalues in the interference matrix is small and thus the trace of the interference matrix is mostly contributed by the largest eigenvalue .",
    "however , when @xmath23 becomes large , the impact of smaller eigenvalues of the interfering matrix can be comparable to the largest one .",
    "thus , imposing a constraint on the maximum eigenvalue may not appropriately characterize the interference situation .",
    "in other words , the interference can be more severe that it is supposed to be .",
    "this leads to a reduction on the achieved sr of the primary system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate : transmitpower : pusystem ] .    finally , we study the sr of sus as a function of the correlation coefficient @xmath246 in fig .  [",
    "fig : sumrate : correlation ] .",
    "in particular , we compare the performance of the proposed design with that of two suboptimal schemes . for suboptimal scheme 1 ,",
    "the zf precoding at the secondary bs is chosen to eliminate the interference at both sus and pus .",
    "for suboptimal scheme 2 , the zf precoding for the @xmath27th su is given by @xmath247 where @xmath248 contains the @xmath249 singular vectors of @xmath250 , i.e. , it comes from a compact svd of @xmath250 : @xmath251 , and @xmath252 is the solution of @xcite .",
    "the results show that the sr of all the schemes decreases as the correlation coefficient increases .",
    "this is because a high correlation coefficient reduces the spatial diversity of the secondary system .",
    "importantly , the proposed design shows superior performance compared to the others .",
    "another interesting observation is that , in the strong correlation regime , the sum rate of the suboptimal scheme 2 is larger than that of the suboptimal scheme 1 and vice versa in the weak correlation regime .",
    "the reason is that as the spatial correlation at the transmitter and receiver is stronger , the channels become more directional and thus interference isolation can be achieved physically .",
    "accordingly , the effect of the secondary system on the primary one will be small .",
    "consequently , the suboptimal scheme 2 has more degrees of freedom when designing the precoders for the secondary system as it does not force those precoders to be in the null space of the pu channels .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the sum rate maximization problem for downlink transmission of mimo cr networks in the presence of multiple sus and pus .",
    "the design problem is subject to per - antenna power constraints at the secondary bs and interference constraints at the pus . adopting zf precoding technique and using a rank relaxation method which is shown to be tight , we have transformed the problem of sr maximization into the one of finding a saddle point of a convex - concave program .",
    "then a computationally efficient algorithm has been proposed based on a barrier method to solve the resulting convex - concave problem , exploiting its special properties .",
    "the proposed algorithm was numerically shown to have a superlinear convergence behavior which is almost independent of the problem size . through numerical experiments ,",
    "we have illustrated how the performances of the secondary and the primary systems vary with the type of the interference constraints considered in the paper .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the performance of the secondary system degrades significantly and reaches a saturated value when either the number of primary users or the number of antennas at the primary user is large .",
    "also , we have discussed different ways of controlling amount of the interference caused by the secondary system . specifically , we have concluded that using the trace of the interference matrix may reflect the interference situation better , compared to using the largest eigenvalue .    to prove theorem 1",
    ", we will follow the same steps as those in @xcite but customize them to our considered problem .",
    "particularly we show that is the dual problem of the relaxed problem of .",
    "let us start by writing the partial lagrangian function of the relaxed problem of as @xmath253 where @xmath254 , @xmath255\\bar{\\mathbf{v}}_k$ ] and @xmath256 .",
    "@xmath257 and @xmath258 are lagrangian multipliers corresponding to the constraints in and , respectively . from the dual problem ,",
    "the dual objective of is given by @xmath259 to solve the maximization in for a given set of lagrangian multipliers @xmath260 , we first rewrite the lagrangian function as @xmath261 where @xmath262 , @xmath263^t$ ] , @xmath264^t$ ] , @xmath265^t$ ] , and @xmath266^t$ ] . since @xmath267 is invertible or @xmath258 must be positive .",
    "this is because of all power at the secondary bs should be used up or the interference constraint should be met at the optimum , i.e. , @xmath268 or @xmath269 .",
    "] , let @xmath270 .",
    "the maximization in is rewritten as @xmath271 to compute the dual objective , let @xmath72 be a svd of @xmath73 where @xmath74 is square and diagonal .",
    "then , we can apply a result in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) to find @xmath272 as            now the dual problem of is given by @xmath275 or equivalently @xmath276 to arrive at a minimax program given in , we introduce another optimization variable @xmath277 and rewrite as @xmath278 it is easy to see that is equivalent to since the inequality ( use subequation environment and give a label to the trace(@xmath279 ) constraint ) in must hold with equality at optimality ; otherwise we can scale down @xmath280 to achieve a strictly larger objective .",
    "next we make a change of variables as @xmath281 and define @xmath282^t\\\\ & \\mathbf{\\tilde{\\lambda}}=\\mathbf{\\lambda}/\\vartheta=\\operatorname{diag}(\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\eta}})+\\sum_{m=1}^m\\tilde{\\lambda}_m\\mathbf{g}_{m}^h\\mathbf{g}_{m}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now consider @xmath283 and @xmath284 as new optimization variables .",
    "then , can be equivalently expressed as @xmath285 clearly , the optimal dual variable @xmath286 can be obtained by considering the minimization of over @xmath283 . hence , is the dual of the following problem : @xmath287 finally , putting , , and @xmath288 together finalizes the proof .",
    "we now show how theorem [ thm : bc - mac - duality ] can be modified to include a spc constraint which is written as @xmath289 , where @xmath224 is the total transmit power at the secondary bs . by following the same steps from to",

    "<S> we consider a linear precoder design for an underlay cognitive radio multiple - input multiple - output broadcast channel , where the secondary system consisting of a secondary base - station ( bs ) and a group of secondary users ( sus ) is allowed to share the same spectrum with the primary system . </S>",
    "<S> all the transceivers are equipped with multiple antennas , each of which has its own maximum power constraint . </S>",
    "<S> assuming zero - forcing method to eliminate the multiuser interference , we study the sum rate maximization problem for the secondary system subject to both per - antenna power constraints at the secondary bs and the interference power constraints at the primary users . the problem of interest differs from the ones studied previously that often assumed a sum power constraint and/or single antenna employed at either both the primary and secondary receivers or the primary receivers . </S>",
    "<S> to develop an efficient numerical algorithm , we first invoke the rank relaxation method to transform the considered problem into a convex - concave problem based on a downlink - uplink result . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose a barrier interior - point method to solve the resulting saddle point problem . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in each iteration of the proposed method we find the newton step by solving a system of discrete - time sylvester equations , which help reduce the complexity significantly , compared to the conventional method . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results are provided to demonstrate fast convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .    </S>",
