    "with the advent of integral field spectrographs on large telescopes , it is now possible to obtain high - spatial - resolution two - dimensional ( 2d ) kinematics of the gas and stars , allowing a more complete picture of the nuclear kinematics and avoiding the misinterpretations inherent to the one - dimensional information of the velocity fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "correct interpretation of integral - field data can have implications for radial redistribution of matter in galactic nuclei and therefore for understanding their evolution .",
    "large departures from circular motion also imply that the observed velocity is not a good approximation for the circular velocity , and therefore can not be used directly to estimate the enclosed mass , like in the case of mass estimates of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in centres of galaxies .",

    "data we used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique to fit a gaussian function to the 2  2.12 ,  and  emission lines observed in the continuum - subtracted spectra of the galaxies of the sample .",
    "from the central wavelength and width of the gaussian function we derived the velocity and velocity dispersion ( @xmath12 ) of the gas in each spatial bin . for the description and subtraction of the continuum we applied the penalized pixel fitting method ( ppxf ) of @xcite , using as the stellar template a combination of the spectra of six late - type stars observed with the same configuration as the galaxy data .",
    "spectral regions containing emission lines or spurious lines due to bad pixels and/or bad sky - lines subtraction were masked to ensure the best representation of the stellar continuum .",
    "the adaptive spatial voronoi binning method of @xcite was applied to all our maps , as described in mazzalay2013a . for this , we chose a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) threshold for each measured line in each galaxy so as not to compromise the high - spatial resolution in high - snr regions and , at the same time , be able to extract information in regions of low snr .",
    "the emission lines of all the galaxies except 4579 were well described by a single gaussian component .",
    "the emission - line profiles of 4579 display strong asymmetries and double components in some regions .",
    "therefore , a single - gaussian fit is insufficient to properly describe the emission lines , and since a multi - gaussian approach would lead to large uncertainties in the kinematic parameters ( due to the large number of degrees of freedom to constrain such fits ) , no kinematic maps were constructed for this galaxy .",

    "the uncertainties of the kinematic parameters given by their variance within the mcmc samples are @xmath14 . since the gaussian fitting",
    "is performed with the continuum - subtracted spectra , this uncertainty does not take into account the errors in the determination of the continuum , which will particularly affect the values derived for the velocity dispersion . in order to derive more realistic uncertainties for the kinematic parameters",
    ", we repeated our analysis by subtracting continua equal to the original continuum value @xmath15 times the continuum noise level .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t_kin ]    @xcite make further use of @xmath21 as an indicator of the disc thickness , suggesting that this ratio increases with radius more rapidly in llagn than in seyfert galaxies ( on average @xmath22 at @xmath23 and @xmath24  pc , respectively ) , but slower than in starbursts and inactive galaxies ( @xmath22 at @xmath25  pc ) , which they interpret as different thickness of the nuclear disc at various stages of nuclear activity and a possible evolutionary sequence of agn activity and smbh growth .",
    "the galaxies in our sample cover a range of nuclear activity , including starburst ( 3351 ) , llagn ( e.g. 4536 ) and seyfert ( e.g. 4501 ) ; see column  3 of table  [ t_prop ] .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to compare our data with the scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "[ f_v_sigma ] shows the ratio of the deprojected velocity to the velocity dispersion of the 2  emission - line gas as a function of the distance from the nucleus for the four galaxies in our sample that display ordered velocity fields .",
    "we also include in table  [ t_kin ] the deprojected velocity , velocity dispersion and @xmath21 for both the stars and 2  gas , measured at a distance of 50  pc from the nucleus of these galaxies .",
    "two of our galaxies display @xmath22 at radii similar to those proposed by mller - snchez et al . :",
    "the llagn 3627 shows @xmath22 at @xmath26  pc and the seyfert  2 galaxy 4501 at @xmath27  pc .",
    "however , the other two galaxies for which @xmath21 was possible to estimate , 3351 and 4536 , disagree with the range of values derived by these authors . the first galaxy , probably best classified as a starburst , has @xmath22 at a relative large radius ( @xmath23  pc ) compared to the non - agn galaxies in mller - snchez et al.s sample ; it is much more similar to their llagns",
    ". the second galaxy , a llagn , does not reach @xmath22 until @xmath27  pc , which is consistent with the seyfert galaxies in mller - snchez et al.s sample instead of the llagns .",
    "thus , only two of four galaxies in our sample follow the scenario proposed by mller - snchez et al .. so far , this scenario has been tested in only a handful of objects ( sixteen including our galaxies ) , and additional observations are needed to derive more robust conclusions .",
    "we also note that there are observational indications that @xmath4 may not always be a good indicator of disc thickness . for example , @xcite note the elongated contours in both flux and velocity dispersion maps of 2  emission in 5128 ( centaurus  a ) , which they suggest is consistent with high - velocity - dispersion gas residing in a disc on scales of 0.4  arcsec in radius .",
    "however , the @xmath4 ratio is below 0.5 in this region ; if this is interpreted in the disc - thickness paradigm , then the inner region should be effectively spherical and the contours should be much rounder than they actually are .    more generally , if such circumnuclear discs are indeed thick in their innermost regions , the ellipticity of their isophotes should decrease towards the centre once the thickened region is approached . in our sample , this might be the case in 3627 , where the ellipticity of the 2  emission line distribution does decrease inside a radius of 1  arcsec , and also in 4536 , where the 2  distribution is almost circular inside the nuclear ring [ @xmath281  arcsec , see][]mazzalay2013a .",
    "on the other hand , the 2  emission in the inner 1  arcsec of 3351 is highly elongated , down to our resolution limit , which may indicate that 3351 does not posses a thick nuclear disc , at least on scales larger than the psf of our observations .",
    "additional clues about the geometrical and optical thickness of gas discs can potentially be obtained from their velocity maps .",
    "if a clear twist in the zero - velocity line is observed in the central region , as in the case of 4536 , then the disc can not be both geometrically thick and optically thin in this region , because the velocity gradient perpendicular to the lon would then be erased by geometrical projection effects .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f_discpeter ] , where we show projections of an optically thin disc model with different scale heights .",
    "this model uses the model velocity field from our fit to the hr velocity field of 4536 , assuming cylindrical rotation , with 2  emissivity following a uniform radial profile and an exponential vertical profile .",
    "we incline it at 67 and perform los integrations through the model while assuming different scale heights @xmath29 .",
    "a thin disc ( @xmath30  pc , left panel ) shows the same complexity as the input velocity field .",
    "but when the disc has a scale height of 20  pc ( middle panel ) , the twist in the zero - velocity line is strongly smeared , and for @xmath31  pc , almost none of the original spatial complexity is preserved .",
    "we conclude that the inner disc in 4536 is either thin , despite its high velocity dispersion , or that it is both geometrically _ and _ optically thick .",
    "the galaxies discussed in this paper were originally observed with sinfoni as part of a project to measure central smbh masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the primary aim of that project has been to use the _ stellar _ kinematics to determine the smbh masses ( erwin et al . in preparation ) , it is interesting to investigate to what extent the gas kinematics might also be used for this purpose .",
    "this is particularly relevant given that gas kinematics has been one of the main tools for measuring smbh masses ( see references in sections  [ s_intro ] and [ s_discdyn ] ) . under standard assumptions , using gas kinematics is considerably easier than using stellar kinematics , since the latter involves the iterative calculation of thousands or tens of thousands of stellar orbits in a model potential as part of the schwarzschild modelling process , which is computationally very intensive .",
    "in contrast , using gas kinematics can ( ideally ) be as simple as matching a model circular - velocity curve to a gas rotation curve .    however , the drawback of the gas - kinematics approach is that it usually requires to make certain simplifying assumptions about the gas : in particular , that the gas is in _ ordered , circular _ motion  ideally in a kinematically cold disc .",
    "how often are these assumptions valid for the galaxies in our sample ?    4569 and 4579 are strongly ruled out in this sense : the circumnuclear gas motions in both galaxies are severely disordered , with clear evidence for multiple components in the case of the latter galaxy . in three more galaxies",
    " 3627 , 4501 and 4536  we see gas which _ is _ in ordered motion , but which is also clearly not in _ circular _ motion .",
    "two of these galaxies have evidence for rotating , oval flows , while in 4501 the situation is complicated by the presence of a separate gas filament which does not participate in the general rotation of the gas , severely distorting the observed velocity field .    only one of the six spirals in this study ",
    "3351  shows a velocity field that can be described by simple circular rotation .",
    "however , it also has high velocity dispersion in the gas , exceeding the rotation velocity out to a radius of 3050  pc . if this velocity dispersion can be ascribed to the local turbulence ( see section  [ s_3351 ] ) , then the observed gas rotation can be interpreted as the circular velocity of the potential and the dispersion would not affect the smbh mass estimate . however , if the velocity dispersion is dynamical , then the observed rotation will be less than the circular velocity , and the dispersion must be included in the smbh mass estimate ( e.g. via asymmetric drift or a pressure - like term in jeans equations , see section  [ s_discdyn ] ) , and the estimated mass has to be corrected upwards from its value in the circular - rotation case .",
    "such a correction can be rather significant ; in the case of m84 , @xcite showed that even when the velocity dispersion remained less than 0.6 of the rotation velocity value , the correction was of order 100 per cent . in a galaxy like 3351 , where the dispersion is _ larger _",
    "than the velocity in the innermost regions , this correction could be even higher .",
    "the reality may be that the observed gas velocity dispersion is partly non - dynamical and partly dynamical ; unfortunately , as the discussion in section  [ s_discdyn ] makes clear , we are currently unable to determine what the relative proportions are or should be for these galaxies .",
    "moreover , if the velocity dispersion is dynamical and isotropic , it not only affects the smbh mass estimate through altering the azimuthal velocity , but also leads to the thickening of the disc .",
    "then a proper estimate of smbh mass should include projection effects and integration of emission through the thick disc along the los .",
    "thus far , all smbh mass estimates that take into account velocity dispersion in the disc assume that the disc is geometrically thin .",
    "we are not aware of smbh mass estimates that take into account the thickness of the gaseous disc in the innermost parsecs .",
    "of the galaxies in our sample , 4501 is the only one so far for which the central smbh mass has been estimated via stellar dynamical modelling ( erwin et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we can perform a simple exercise and compare the enclosed ( dynamical ) mass as a function of the radius given by that model ( paperi ; erwin et al . in preparation ) with that expected from the gas kinematics under commonly made simplifying assumptions .",
    "[ f_n4501enclosed ] shows the deprojected enclosed mass as a function of the radius @xmath32 given by the stellar dynamical model ( green line ) and the enclosed mass derived from the 2  emission - line gas kinematics in two cases .",
    "in the first case , we discard any possible dynamical contribution from the velocity dispersion and assume that the 2  deprojected velocity derived from the ",
    "data represents the circular velocity of the gravitational potential ( blue open circles ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the gravitational constant . in the second case",
    ", we assume that the velocity dispersion is dynamically important and estimate the enclosed mass by @xmath35 ( blue filled circles ) . in both cases , we compute the 2  rotation curve while excluding the part of the velocity field which is clearly affected by the blue kinematic spiral observed in this galaxy ( see fig .",

    "[ f_n4501enclosed ] shows that the mass derived from the 2  emission - line kinematics using these simple approaches significantly underpredicts the enclosed mass of the galaxy .",
    "when we assume that the velocity dispersion is dynamically unimportant , we obtain masses at least a factor of 5 lower than those derived from the stellar dynamical model .",
    "there is an improvement when we include the 2  velocity dispersion in the calculation , although the enclosed mass is still underpredicted by factors of between 1.5 and 3 .",
    "note that the innermost point of the enclosed mass estimates from gas dynamics including velocity dispersion in fig .",
    "[ f_n4501enclosed ] indicates a mass which is still lower than that from the stellar - dynamical estimate , contrary to the common belief that mass estimates from gas velocity dispersion within a given aperture yield upper limits on mass .",
    "the latter is true when the observed velocity dispersion arises solely from circular motion in a cold disc within the aperture , but in our case the observed velocity dispersion is dominated by the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the gas , something which , if it is not continuously driven by an external source of energy , is being gradually lost via dissipation .",

    "in mazzalay2013a we analysed the morphology and physical properties of the gas , as well as the mass content of the galaxies . here , we focus on the kinematics of the 2  emission - line gas , complementing it with the stellar kinematics derived from the same dataset .",
    "a detailed kinematic analysis of each of the six galaxies is carried out , placed in the context of the large - scale structure of the galaxies .",
    "we scrutinize the suitability of assumptions commonly made such as circular motion and thin discs .    from the analysis of the velocity fields we find different types of flows that can be ordered by increasing complexity .",
    "the simplest case is that of 3351 , where the velocity field is consistent with gas rotating in circular orbits in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "more complex velocity fields are shown by 3627 and 4536 . in 3627",
    "we find signatures of shocks in the gas , possibly associated with two bright blobs of 2  emission that form part of the molecular bar in this galaxy , as well as a misalignment of the kinematic axis of the gas and stars in the inner @xmath40  arcsec radius .",
    "the latter feature can be explained as an oval gas flow , one aligned with the 2  distribution ( but not with the stellar bar ) , implying a strong torque from the stellar bar on the 2  flow .",
    "4536 shows a strong twist in the zero - velocity line in the regions inside the nuclear star - forming ring . as in the case of 3627",
    ", the departures from circular motions are well reproduced by an oval flow , possibly driven by an inner bar . in 4501",
    ", the bulk of the 2  emission - line gas seems to be co - rotating with the stars in circular orbits in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "however , strong deviations are observed in the form of a blueshifted kinematic feature , resembling a ( single ) spiral arm . from our analysis we conclude that this feature is not a spiral density wave but rather a filament moving with respect to the rotating galaxy disc .",
    "finally , 4569 and 4579 show complex , highly perturbed velocity fields , with no evidence for ordered circular motion .    in all the galaxies of our sample ,",
    "the observed 2  velocity dispersion in the inner 12  arcsec ( @xmath4150160  pc ) radius is high , in general higher than 50 , and increases towards the centre .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion also increases towards the centre , except in the case of 3351 and 3627 , where there is a drop in the stellar velocity dispersion close to the nucleus . in 4536 , there are regions of low velocity dispersion in both the stars and gas spatially coincident with the circumnuclear star - forming ring . due to the large spatial extent of the high - velocity - dispersion gas in our galaxies , we can rule out psf smearing of the rotation curve as a factor , so the high values are intrinsic to the emission - line gas . at this point",
    "is not possible to determine whether these high values of velocity dispersion are predominantly dynamical ( which would mean they play an important role in the disc dynamics ) or intrinsically non - dynamical ( due to , e.g. turbulence ) .",
    "we analysed the radial behaviour of @xmath21 for the gas , which is sometimes used to estimate the disc thickness .",
    "we found that @xmath21 is @xmath42 in these galaxies interior to a radius of 4080  pc ; the distance at which @xmath21 is equal to unity is independent of the nuclear activity in the galaxies .",
    "we have also presented lines of evidence that argue against a thick circumnuclear gas disc interpretation for some galaxies ( e.g. 3351 and 4536 ) , suggesting that the @xmath21 ratio may not always be a good indicator of the disc thickness .",
    "the complexity of the 2  emission - line kinematics displayed by the galaxies in our sample argues against the validity of simple assumptions commonly made to derive smbh masses from gas kinematics , and highlights the importance of having full 2d information .",
    "understanding the role of the gas velocity dispersion in the gas dynamics is key for deriving accurate smbh masses from gas kinematics .",
    "we expect that future alma observations will provide the necessary information about the cold and dense molecular gas which , together with nir ifs data , will help to shed light on the origin of the gas velocity dispersion and its role in the dynamics of the gas in galactic nuclei .",

    "in a few of the galaxies analysed in this paper , there is strong morphological ( 3627 ) or kinematic ( 3627 , 4536 ) evidence that the gas flow is highly eccentric .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , such flows are not well described by simple departures from circular motion . here",
    "we propose a simple model of an oval gas flow which can be used to fit and interpret the observed los velocity field .",
    "for an oval flow , the observed maximum - velocity line ( which corresponds to the lon in the case of circular flow ) is not as robust an indicator of the flow as the zero - velocity line is .",
    "this is because the maximum - velocity line can change orientation depending on the distribution of speeds along the ellipse , while the zero - velocity line depends only on the geometry . in particular ,",
    "if we have a non - rotating flow along concentric ellipses of constant axial ratio , @xmath44 , then there is a simple relation connecting the angle between the major axis of the flow in the galaxy plane and the lon ( @xmath45 ) with the angle between that same major axis and the zero - velocity line ( @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 the orientation of these two angles is clarified in fig .",
    "[ f_ap1 ] , and the dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath45 for various values of @xmath48 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f_ap2 ] .",
    "as expected , for circular flows ( @xmath49 ) we have @xmath50 , i.e. the zero - velocity line is perpendicular to the lon . however , when @xmath51 , @xmath46 assumes values closer to zero than in the case of circular flow .",
    "this means that the zero - velocity line shifts towards alignment with the major axis of the flow when the eccentricity of the flow increases .",
    "our model of an oval flow is the same as the one already used by maciejewski et al .",
    "2012 . here",
    "we give the explicit formulae defining the flow .",
    "the oval flow is confined to the disc plane , and it is constructed by compressing the circular flow in one direction , as explained below . in order to allow for the possibility of an oval flow which itself _ rotates _ as a pattern , the circular flow is compressed in a rotating frame , and then the compressed flow is transformed back to the inertial frame .",
    "taking the @xmath52axis in the disc plane as the major axis of the oval flow , compression of the circular flow means rescaling it along the @xmath53axis by a factor of @xmath54 , defined above .",
    "thus the velocity of the oval flow in the disc plane at the @xmath55 position is dictated by the circular velocity @xmath56 at the position @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ f_ap3 ] for an explanation ; in the rotating frame , the velocities are indexed by a prime ) .",
    "any circular velocity can be used , but we settled on a circular velocity that increases with the radius @xmath32 for @xmath58 , and is flat outside this radius , with the velocity @xmath59 . in a reference frame rotating with the angular velocity @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the corotation radius , we have @xmath62 .        for the circular flow in the rotating frame ,",
    "the components of the velocity vector at the position @xmath57 are related to the velocity in the inertial frame , @xmath63 , by @xmath64 where @xmath65^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] .",
    "after the rescaling along the @xmath66 direction , they become the velocity components of the oval flow at the position @xmath55 : @xmath67 note that when we rescale the flow by a factor @xmath48 along the @xmath53axis , so that the flow is now on ellipses of an axial ratio @xmath48 , the @xmath66-component of the velocity is scaled by a factor @xmath48 , while the @xmath68-component remains unchanged .",
    "this ensures that the velocity vector in the rotating frame remains tangential to the oval flow ( see fig .",
    "[ f_ap3 ] ) .",
    "this oval flow is now placed back in the inertial frame by adding to the velocity components at @xmath55 a contribution from the uniform rotation : @xmath69 from these two velocity components one can calculate the los velocity , @xmath70 , as a function of the angle @xmath45 between the major axis of the oval flow and the lon ( fig .",

    "the angle @xmath45 between the major axis of the oval flow and the lon in the plane of the galaxy disc is related to the angle @xmath76 between the same two lines in the sky by @xmath77 in the models built in this paper , we used either a constant @xmath48 , or a scenario where @xmath78 inside the corotation and @xmath79 outside it , representing a flow which is circular at larger radii , but becomes increasingly eccentric towards the centre . in this second scenario ,",
