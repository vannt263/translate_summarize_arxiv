    "at the interaction point 5 of the lhc the combined cms and totem detectors constitute a powerful instrumentation for studying diffractive physics .",
    "the totem part contributes the forward trackers t1 and t2 inside cms and a system of roman pot stations at distances of 147 m , 180 m and 220 m from the interaction point .",
    "the totem detectors and their position w.r.t .",
    "cms are described in  @xcite ( see in particular fig .  2 and  3 therein ) , and in more detail in the totem tdr  @xcite .",
    "the two experiments will be able to take data together , with totem acting technically as a subdetector of cms with the capability to contribute to the level-1 trigger .",
    "the combined cms+totem experiment has a unique rapidity coverage together with an excellent acceptance for leading protons ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rapiditycoverage ] ) .",
    "a part of the only coverage gap around @xmath0 could be filled with an additional leading proton detector ( e.g. a microstation ) at a later time .",
    "one ingredient for the determination of total cross - section and luminosity based on the optical theorem ( see section  [ sec_phys_sigmatotlumi ] ) is the measurement of the total elastic and inelastic rate .",
    "minimum bias inelastic events produce particles distributed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rapiditydistrib ] ( upper part ) . the coverage of t1 , t2 overlaps sufficiently with the particle distribution , ensuring an efficiency of 99.9% for detecting minimum bias inelastic events .",
    "elastic events on the other hand are well covered by the roman pots .",
    "considering that the energy flow in inelastic collisions is predominantly oriented in the forward direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rapiditydistrib ] , lower part ) , the subdetectors t1 , t2 and the hf and castor calorimeters are valuable for studying forward showers as observed in cosmic ray physics .",
    "the running scenarios for forward physics are listed in table  [ tab_scenarios ] . for the precise measurement of proton scattering angles on the few @xmath1rad level a special beam optics scheme with @xmath2 m was developed .",
    "it is characterised by a small beam divergence in the interaction point ( 0.29@xmath1rad ) and a focal point in the roman pot station at 220 m for both the horizontal ( @xmath3 ) and the vertical ( @xmath4 ) track projections . in order to avoid parasitical bunch crossings downstream of the nominal interaction point due to the parallelism and large width ( @xmath5 mm ) of the two beams ,",
    "the number of bunches will be reduced from 2808 to initially 43 and later 156 .",
    "scenario 1 will serve for measuring the elastic cross - section at low @xmath6 ( section  [ sec_phys_elastic ] ) , the total cross - section , the absolute luminosity ( section  [ sec_phys_sigmatotlumi ] ) and soft diffraction ( section  [ sec_phys_diffrac ] ) . to minimize the emittance ,",
    "these runs will be done with a smaller bunch population .",
    "scenario 3 was introduced for measuring elastic scattering at large @xmath6 .",
    "it offers a @xmath7-acceptance complementary to scenario 1 and a higher luminosity .",
    "higher luminosities for ( semi- ) hard diffraction ( scenarios 2 and 4 ) can be reached by increasing the number of bunches and the bunch population .",
    "some details of the optics for scenario 4 are still under development .    totem operation with normal lhc beam optics ( @xmath8 m ) and @xmath9@xmath10s@xmath11 is under study but not yet part of the official programme .",
    "a common cms+totem letter of intent for diffractive physics is in preparation .",
    "extrapolations of the total pp cross - section from existing measurements at @xmath12tev to the lhc cm energy of 14tev suffer from the conflicting tevatron measurements and cover a wide range , typically from 90 to 130 mb ( see fig .  1 in  @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic ray experiments have provided direct measurements up to a few tens of tev but with uncertainties on the 20% level .",
    "the totem collaboration envisages a precision of about 1% using the optical theorem : @xmath13 the extrapolation of the elastic cross - section to @xmath14 suffers mainly from insufficient knowledge of the functional form ( see section  [ sec_phys_elastic ] ) and from uncertainties in beam energy , detector alignment and crossing angle .",
    "the expected systematic error is about 0.5% whereas the statistical error is less than 0.1% for only 10 hours of running .",
    "the uncertainty of the total rate ( @xmath15 ) is given by trigger losses and beam - gas background  @xcite ; it amounts to 0.8% . taking also into account the uncertainty in @xmath16 which enters only as a quadratic correction term",
    ", @xmath17 can be measured with about 1% precision .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the absolute luminosity measurement which is based on the same observables : @xmath18 also here , a precision of the order 1% is expected .",
    "@xmath19 will be directly measured at totem s running scenarios 1 and 2 , i.e. at the relatively low luminosities of @xmath20@xmath10s@xmath11 and @xmath21@xmath10s@xmath11 . in these two operating points",
    "the cms luminosity monitors will be calibrated against totem s absolute result , in order to be used later for relative measurements at higher luminosities .",
    "a different approach is envisaged by the atlas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it will be attempted to measure the differential cross - section of elastic scattering down to @xmath22gev@xmath23 where the dominating coulomb scattering provides the absolute scale . in practice",
    ", the measured event rate would be fitted to @xmath24 with @xmath19 , @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 as free parameters .",
    "the differential cross - section @xmath27 of elastic scattering according to the bsw model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sigmaelastic ] .",
    "note that there is a rather wide range of predictions for @xmath27 at lhc - typical centre - of - mass energies .",
    "totem will cover the @xmath6-range from @xmath28gev@xmath23 to 8gev@xmath23 with its running scenarios 1 and 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_sigmaelastic ] ) . since the @xmath7-acceptance for scenario 1 with its @xmath29 m optics ends around 1.5gev@xmath23 ( see also fig .  10 in  @xcite ) and since at higher @xmath6 more luminosity is needed , scenario 3 with a @xmath30 m optics was created to extend the reach in @xmath6 .",
    "the ranges accessible to the two scenarios overlap between 0.5 and 1.5gev@xmath23 .",
    "comfortable statistics can be collected in only 1 day of running with each of the scenarios ( see right - hand scales in fig .  [ fig_sigmaelastic ] ) . at @xmath31gev@xmath23",
    "the statistics are sufficient for narrow bins of @xmath32gev@xmath23 width : at @xmath28gev@xmath23 one will acquire @xmath33 events per bin , and at @xmath34gev@xmath23 still @xmath35 events per bin .    assuming an elastic cross - section of 30 mb , about @xmath36 events can be collected during one day at a luminosity of @xmath37@xmath10s@xmath11 .",
    "access to the coulomb and interference region at @xmath38gev@xmath23 will be attempted in two ways or a combination of them ( see fig .  [ fig_tae ] ) :    * move the roman pot detectors closer to the beam .",
    "this could be achieved by reducing the number of protons per bunch which would allow for a smaller emittance .",
    "the luminosity loss could be compensated by increasing the number of bunches .",
    "suppose , the normalised emittance can be reduced to @xmath39mrad , and stable lhc operation allows the detectors to approach the beam to @xmath40 with @xmath41 mm .",
    "then the @xmath6-value with 50% acceptance would be given by @xmath42 where @xmath43tev is the proton momentum , @xmath44 m is the beam optics effective length in the vertical plane , @xmath45 m is the betatron function at the detector , and the relativistic @xmath46 is 7460.5 .",
    "* run the lhc with a reduced centre - of - mass energy @xmath47tev . according to ( [ eqn_t50 ] )",
    ", the reduction of @xmath48 with decreasing @xmath49 due to the leading factor @xmath50 is lessened by the @xmath51 dependence of the beam width @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting effect behaves like @xmath53 .",
    "the data taken during 1 day with scenario 1 contain not only @xmath54 elastic events and @xmath55 non - diffractive inelastic events , but also about @xmath56 ( mostly soft ) diffractive events .",
    "[ fig_diffracprocesses ] shows the basic classes of diffractive processes and the expected statistics with scenarios 1 and 2 .",
    "the latter has the advantage of providing a 15 times higher luminosity which can serve for processes with small cross - section , such as double pomeron exchange or semi - hard phenomena .",
    "note that the estimates of diffractive cross - sections are based on rather uncertain extrapolations from lower energies to lhc conditions .",
    "the simultaneous observation of rapidity gaps @xmath57 and the momentum loss @xmath58 of surviving protons will allow to test the relationship @xmath59 , valid for pure colour singlet exchange .",
    "it is still unknown with which probability the rapidity gaps will `` survive '' at lhc energies , i.e. not be filled by hadronisation from higher - order soft rescattering processes .",
    "the great advantage of the scenarios at @xmath2 m is the very good acceptance in momentum transfer @xmath7 and momentum loss @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_txiaccept ] ) . for @xmath60 all protons",
    "are detected independent of @xmath61 . assuming a differential cross - section @xmath62 with @xmath63gev@xmath64 , the total acceptance ( integrated over @xmath7 and @xmath61 ) is about 95% .",
    "the @xmath61 resolution using the rp stations at 147 m and 220 m with the dipole d2 in between is about @xmath65 .      for double - pomeron exchange and",
    "hard diffractive processes with their lower cross - sections , scenario 4 with a luminosity of the order @xmath67@xmath10s@xmath11 will be advantageous .",
    "although some details of that scenario are still under study , the acceptance in @xmath7 and @xmath61 is expected to be about 86% .",
    "for the @xmath61-resolution a level of @xmath68 will be attempted , i.e. an improvement of a factor 5 w.r.t . the @xmath69 m optics .",

    "the event numbers per day ( right - hand scales ) show by extrapolation that diffractive systems with masses up to about 2tev are well within reach .",
    "a particularly interesting class of double - pomeron events is exclusive central production .",
    "it is characterised by a clean signature of two surviving protons , two rapidity gaps and only a single particle ( or a dijet ) in the diffractive system . due to the exchange of colour - singlets",
    "( having the quantum numbers of the vacuum ) , the states produced in the centre must obey selection rules on spin @xmath70 , parity @xmath71 and charge conjugation @xmath72  @xcite : @xmath73 ( in the limit of @xmath74 ) .",
    "the @xmath75 rule strongly suppresses gg@xmath76 background because of helicity conservation ( this background would totally vanish for massless quarks ) .",
    "some examples for exclusive production are given in table  [ tab_exclusivedpe ] .",
    "the @xmath77 resonance may be within reach .",
    "the @xmath78 resonance is more uncertain because the branching ratios of its decays are not known .",
    "detecting a 120gev higgs requires luminosities higher than the ones of the running scenarios established so far . for this purpose ,",
    "new scenarios for standard lhc optics ( @xmath8 m ) and luminosities ( @xmath79 ) are being developed for a later stage .",
    "these ideas also involve additional rp stations in the cryogenic lhc region ( at 308 m , 338 m and 420 m from the ip ) in order to achieve an adequate @xmath61 acceptance .",
