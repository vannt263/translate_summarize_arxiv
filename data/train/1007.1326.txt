    "[ fig : expscheme ] . as in the adiabatic case , after the initial loading phase the lattice was accelerated with acceleration @xmath132 for a time @xmath48 . at that point",
    "the atomic sample was projected onto the free - particle diabatic basis by instantaneously ( within less than @xmath157 ) switching off the optical lattice . after a time - of - flight the number of atoms in the @xmath158 and @xmath159 momentum classes are measured and from these the survival probability ( corresponding to the atoms remaining in the @xmath158 velocity class relative to the total atom number ) is calculated .",
    "[ fig : diab_exp ] shows the results of such measurements , together with numerical simulations based on eq .  .",
    "as in the adiabatic case , a step of the survival probability around @xmath160 is clearly seen , as well as strong oscillations for @xmath161 .",
    "these oscillations are much stronger and visible for a wider range of parameters in the diabatic basis than in the adiabatic basis ( see the results for @xmath162 in fig . [",

    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices provide an ideal model system for time - resolved studies of lz tunneling .",
    "the complete control over the parameters of the lattice makes it possible to measure the tunneling dynamics in the adiabatic and diabatic bases by using different measurement methods .",
    "our results confirm the existence of a finite temporal width for the transition in both bases and of strong oscillations of the survival probability in the diabatic basis . both of these features are backed up by numerical simulations taking into account details of the experimental protocol .",
    "+ our findings pave the way towards more quantitative studies of the tunneling time for lz transitions , which are of current interest in the context of optimal quantum control and the quantum speed limit @xcite .",
    "also , it should be possible to measure the tunneling dynamics in arbitrary bases by inducing a rotation of the @xmath170 lz - matrix through variations in the lattice depth during the transition . with an appropriate choice of this variation",
    "one could then , for instance , realize the super - adiabatic basis proposed by m. berry @xcite . + * acknowledgments * we gratefully acknowledge funding by the eu project `` namequam '' , the cnism `` progetto innesco 2007 '' and the excellence initiative by the german research foundation ( dfg ) through the heidelberg graduate school of fundamental physics ( grant number gsc 129/1 ) and the global networks mobility measures .",
