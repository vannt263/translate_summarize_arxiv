    "the large momentum transfer photoproduction reactions with two - body breakup of the nucleus represent one of the testing grounds for nuclear quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",

    "hard nuclear scattering , in which the energy - momentum transferred to the nucleus is much larger than the nucleon masses , is one of the best processes to probe quark degrees of freedom in the nucleus . in the hard scattering kinematic regime",
    ", we expect that only the minimal fock components dominate in the wave function of the particles involved in the scattering .",
    "this expectation results in the prediction of the constituent ( or quark ) counting rule , according to which the energy dependence of two - body hard reaction is defined by the number of fundamental constituents participating in the reaction@xcite .",
    "if we consider a reaction of the type @xmath13 , according to constituent counting rule , the energy dependence of the hard process should scale as @xmath14 where @xmath15 represent the numbers of the fundamental fields associated with respective particles involved in the process .",

    "( [ scaling ] ) do not imply the onset of the perturbative qcd regime , they indicate that the resolution of the probe is such that it allows us to identify the constituents of the hadrons that participate in the hard scattering . in 1976",
    "it was suggested@xcite to use the concept of the quark - counting rule to explore the qcd degrees of freedom in nuclei .",
    "one of the best candidate reactions was hard photodisintegration of the deuteron , @xmath18 , which , according to eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) , should scale as @xmath19 .",
    "the first such experiments being carried out at slac@xcite and jefferson lab@xcite revealed @xmath20 scaling for photon energies already at @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the calculations based on a conventional mesonic picture of strong interaction failed to explain the observed energy scaling , which can be considered another indication that the quark degrees of freedom need to be included for an adequate description of the reaction .",
    "the deuteron two - body hard photodisintegration reactions have been used also to measure the polarization observables@xcite , which were in general agreement with the quark - constituent picture of hard scattering .    to check the universality of the constituent counting rule for other hard breakup reactions ,",
    "the two - body reactions were extended to a @xmath5he target , in which case two fast outgoing protons and slow neutron were detected in the @xmath23he@xmath24 reactiont@xcite .",
    "the results of this experiment@xcite were consistent with the @xmath20 scaling in the two - proton hard beak up channel , but at much larger photon energies ( @xmath25 gev ) than in the case of @xmath26 breakup .",
    "recently the hard two - body breakup reaction was measured for the more complex @xmath27 @xmath5he@xmath28",

    "( [ scaling ] ) such a reaction in the hard scattering regime should scale as @xmath3 , and surprisingly the experiment observed a scaling consistent with the exponent of 17 , an unprecedented large number to be observed in two - body hard processes .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the theoretical framework referred as hard rescattering mechanism(hrm ) to calculate the cross section of above mentioned @xmath29he@xmath6 reaction .",
    "the hrm model was originally developed for calculation of @xmath30 reactions@xcite .",
    "the model was successful not only in verifying the @xmath20 dependence but also reproducing the absolute magnitude of the @xmath31 cross sections without free parameters at @xmath32  gev incoming photon energies and large center of mass angles@xcite .",
    "the hrm model allowed also the calculation of polarization observables for the @xmath30 reaction@xcite , and its prediction for the large magnitude of transferred polarization was confirmed by the experiment of ref.@xcite .",
    "subsequently the hrm model was applied to the @xmath33he @xmath34 reactions@xcite , in which two protons were produced in the hard break - up process while the neutron was soft .",
    "the model described the scaling properties and the cross section reasonably well and was able to explain the observed smaller cross section as compared to the deuteron break - up reaction .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown also that hrm model can be extended to the hard break - up of the nucleus to any two - baryonic state which can be produced from the @xmath35 scattering through the quark - interchange interaction . in the hrm model , a quark of the one nucleon knocked out by the incoming photon rescatters with a quark of the other nucleon leading to a production of two nucleons with large relative momentum .",
    "we assume in hrm that the quark interchange is the dominant mechanism for the hard rescattering of two outgoing energetic nucleons .",
    "the latter assumption is essential for factorization of the hard scattering kernel from the soft incalculable part of the scattering amplitude .    in the present work we apply a similar rescattering scenario for the hard break - up of a @xmath5he nucleus to a @xmath1 pair .",
    "our main goal is to check whether the hrm approach , which explicitly accounts for the quark degrees of freedom , will allow us to reproduce the energy and angular dependencies of the measured cross sections .",

    "section iv presents numerical estimates and a comparison with the results of the recent experiments at @xmath37 .",
    "it also gives predictions for the angular distribution of the cross section as well as energy dependencies for other @xmath38 .",

    "the discussion of the hard elastic @xmath39 scattering is presented in appendix b. appendix c discusses the relationship between the light - front and non - relativistic @xmath5he to deuteron transition wave functions .",
    "we are considering the following two - body photodisintegration reaction : @xmath40 where the proton and deuteron are produced at large angles measured in the center - of - mass reference frame of the reaction .",
    "the invariant energy @xmath41 and momentum transfer @xmath42 of the reaction are defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are masses of the proton and @xmath5he target , respectively , and @xmath11 is the incoming photon energy in the laboratory system .",

    "( [ mandelstams ] ) , observed in ref.@xcite , is the possibility to generate large center - of - mass energy @xmath41 with moderate energy of photon beams .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the expression of @xmath41 , photon energy is multiplied by the mass of the target . for the case of reaction ( [ reaction ] ) , for example , the photon energy , @xmath50  gev will generate @xmath41 as large as that generated by a @xmath51  gev/@xmath52 proton beam in @xmath53 scattering .",
    "this property was one of the reasons why the quark - counting scaling was observed in the @xmath30 reaction for photon energies as low as @xmath54 gev at cm @xmath2 break - up kinematics@xcite .",

    "( [ mandelstams ] ) that the photon energy @xmath11 is multiplied by @xmath58 , because of which , even for moderate value of @xmath11 , the high energy condition ( @xmath59 ) is easily achieved .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) , where the invariant momentum transfer @xmath60 is presented as a function of incoming photon energy @xmath61 at large and fixed values of @xmath38 . as the figure shows , even at @xmath62  gev the invariant momentum transfer @xmath63 ( gev / c)@xmath64 , which is sufficiently large for the reaction to be considered hard .    that the reaction ( [ reaction ] ) at @xmath65  gev and @xmath66 can not be considered a conventional nuclear process with knocked - out nucleon and recoiled residual nuclear system follows from fig.1(b ) , where the laboratory momenta of outgoing proton and deuteron are given for large @xmath38 . in this case , one observes that starting at @xmath67  gev/@xmath52 the momenta of outgoing proton and deuteron @xmath68gev/@xmath52 .",
    "such a large momentum of the deuteron significantly exceeds the characteristic fermi momentum in the @xmath5he nucleus , thus the deuteron can not be considered residual .",
    "the momenta of the deuteron are also out of the kinematic range of eikonal , small - angle rescattering@xcite , further diminishing the possibility of describing reaction  ( [ reaction ] ) within the framework of conventional nuclear scattering .",
    "finally , another important feature of the large center - of - mass breakup kinematics is the early onset of qcd degrees of freedom due to the large inelasticities ( or large masses ) produced in the intermediate state of the reaction . as shown in ref.@xcite for photodisinegration of the deuteron , already at photon energies of 1  gev one needs around 15 channels of resonances in the intermediate state to describe the process within the hadronic approach",
    "this situation is similar in the case of the @xmath5he target , in which one estimates the produced mass of the intermediate state as @xmath69 . from this relation one",
    "observes that already at @xmath70  gev , @xmath71  gev , which is close to the deep inelastic threshold of @xmath72 gev , for which qcd degrees of freedom are more adequate .",
    "overall , the above kinematical discussion gives justification for the theoretical description based on the qcd degrees of freedom to be increasingly valid starting at photon energies of @xmath73  gev .    to conclude the section",
    ", we define the reference frame in which the reaction  ( [ reaction ] ) will be considered .",
    "it is defined from the condition for the  + \" and transverse components of incoming photon , @xmath74 , with the photon and target nucleus having the following light - cone four - momenta : @xmath75 where @xmath76 . in the above expression",
    "the @xmath77 components are defined as @xmath78 , where the direction of @xmath79 axis is opposite to the momentum of the incoming photon in the laboratory frame .",
    "in the hrm model , the hard photodisintegration takes place in two stages .",
    "first , the incoming photon knocks out a quark from one of the nucleons .",
    "then in the second step the outgoing fast quark undergoes a high momentum transfer hard scattering with the quark of the other nucleon sharing its large momentum among the constituents in the final state of the reaction .",
    "since hrm utilizes the small momentum part of the target wave function , which has a large component of the initial @xmath1 state , it is assumed that the energetic photon is absorbed by any of the quarks belonging to the protons in the nucleus , with the subsequent hard rescattering of struck quarks off the quarks in the  initial \" @xmath80 system producing the final @xmath1 state .",
    "within such a scenario , the total scattering amplitude can be expressed as a sum of the multitude of the diagrams similar to that of fig .",
    "[ diagram ] , with all possibilities of struck and rescattered quarks combining into a fast outgoing @xmath1 system . instead of summing all the possible diagrams",
    ", the idea of hrm is to factorize the hard @xmath81 scattering and sum the remaining parts to the amplitude of hard elastic @xmath7 scattering . in this way",
    "the complexities related to the large number of diagrams and nonperturbative quark wave function of the nucleons are absorbed into the @xmath7 amplitude , which can be taken from experiment .",

    "the struck quark that now carries almost the whole momentum of the photon will share its momentum with a quark from the other nucleons through the quark interchange .",
    "the resulting two energetic quarks will recombine with the residual quark - gluon systems to produce a proton and deuteron with large relative momentum .",
    "note that the assumption that the nuclear spectator system is represented by intermediate deuteron state is justified based on our previous studies of hrm@xcite , in which it was found that the scattering amplitude is dominated by small initial momenta of interacting nucleons .",
    "for the case of reaction eq . ( [ reaction ] ) , because of the presence of the deuteron in the final state , the small momentum of the initial proton in the @xmath0 nucleus will originate predominantly from a two - body @xmath1 state .    in fig .",
