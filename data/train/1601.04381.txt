    "the root distribution of certain sequences of rational functions with complex coefficients has some peculiar connections with the discriminant of the denominator of its generating function .",
    "in particular , one of the authors @xcite showed that if the generating function of a sequence of polynomials is the reciprocal of a quadratic or cubic polynomial , then the roots of the corresponding sequence of polynomials form a dense set on an explicit algebraic curve .",
    "moreover , in several cases , the endpoints of the curve are the roots of the discriminant of the denominator . for the root distribution of various sequences of polynomials and their generating functions ,",
    "see figure 1 , figure 2 and figure 3 below . for other connections between discriminants and the root distribution ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to study the pair correlation of the roots of a sequence of rational functions when the denominator of the generating function is quadratic .",
    "pair correlation is one of the important statistics concerned with the local spacing distribution of a sequence , and there are many results in the literature on the local spacing distribution of a variety of sequences of interest in number theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the set of triples @xmath10 with @xmath11 rational functions of z with complex coefficients , @xmath2 and @xmath12 not identically zero .",
    "for each @xmath10 in @xmath9 we consider the sequence of rational functions @xmath13 with generating function given by @xmath14 it is easy to see that there exists a finite set of points in the complex plane which contains all the poles of all the rational functions @xmath13 , @xmath15 ( the multiplicity of the poles may increase as @xmath16 increases ) . by contrast , if we consider all the zeros of all @xmath13 , we obtain an infinite set of complex numbers which ( except in some degenerate cases ) is dense on a certain curve @xmath8 which will be described below .",
    "this naturally raises the question of how these points are distributed along @xmath8 .",
    "our goal is to study the pair correlation of the roots of @xmath5 , counting multiplicities .",
    "the rational function @xmath17 plays an important role in our investigation . in this connection ,",
    "let us consider the equivalence relation @xmath18 on @xmath9 defined such that two elements of @xmath9 are equivalent if and only if the corresponding rational function @xmath17 is the same .",
    "we will say that an element @xmath10 of @xmath9 is in standard form provided @xmath19 , @xmath2 and @xmath20 are polynomials , and there is no root of @xmath20 which is simultaneously also a double ( or higher order ) root of @xmath2 .",
    "the last condition above can be restated as saying that the greatest common divisor @xmath21 of @xmath22 and @xmath2 is square free . as examples ,",
    "the triples @xmath10 used in figures 1 and 2 below are in standard form , while the one used in figure 3 is not in standard form , since in that example @xmath23 .",
    "it is easy to see that in every equivalence class there is exactly one element of @xmath9 in standard form .",
    "indeed , notice first that for any @xmath10 in @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath24 belong to the same equivalence class .",
    "also , for any nonzero rational function @xmath25 , the triple @xmath26 belongs to the same equivalence class . here",
    "one can choose @xmath25 such that @xmath26 is in standard form .",
    "for instance , choose first a polynomial @xmath25 such that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are polynomials .",
    "if @xmath28 has a root @xmath29 which is also a multiple root of @xmath27 , divide @xmath25 by @xmath30 . then continue this procedure until all such roots are eliminated .",
    "it follows that any equivalence class contains at least one triple in standard form .",
    "next , if @xmath31 and both triples are in standard form , then @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore @xmath34 divides @xmath35 , and since @xmath21 is square free , this forces @xmath36 to divide @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , @xmath37 divides @xmath36 , so @xmath38 and then @xmath39 . in conclusion , each equivalence class contains exactly one triple in standard form .",
    "let us also remark that , given an arbitrary triple @xmath10 in @xmath9 , the process of finding the unique triple in its equivalence class which is in standard form described above also provides us with a clear understanding of how the roots of the corresponding rational functions @xmath13 change .",
    "more precisely , replacing @xmath10 by @xmath24 has the effect of multiplying each @xmath13 by the fixed rational function @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , replacing @xmath24 by @xmath26 has the same effect as replacing @xmath40 by @xmath41 , that is , has the effect of multiplying each @xmath13 by @xmath42 . in conclusion ,",
    "the distribution of zeros of the rational functions @xmath13 corresponding to a given triple @xmath10 in @xmath9 is exactly the same as the one obtained by replacing @xmath10 by the unique triple in standard form in its equivalence class , except at the location of finitely many points in the complex plane ( where the zeros and poles of c(z ) and e(z ) above lie ) .    taking into account the above discussion",
    ", we restrict ourselves in what follows to study the pair correlation of zeros of @xmath43 for triples @xmath10 which are in standard form . note that in this case all the @xmath13 are polynomials , and @xmath44 , so we may restrict the above product to @xmath45 .",
    "we consider the pair correlation problem on an arbitrary subarc @xmath7 of the curve @xmath8 on which the roots of @xmath3 lie .",
    "this restriction sometimes implies an exclusion of the endpoints of @xmath8 from @xmath7 .",
    "we will see an explicit example in section 3 where the limiting pair correlation function exists on any proper subinterval which does not contain these endpoints . this function does not exist if these endpoints belong to @xmath7 . the pair correlation function is explicitly given in the following theorem .",
    "[ maintheorem ]    let @xmath2 and @xmath20 be polynomials in @xmath46 with complex coefficients , @xmath2 not identically zero , such that the greatest common divisor of @xmath22 and @xmath2 is square free , and consider the polynomials @xmath3 with generating function @xmath47 then the set of roots of all the @xmath3 is dense on a fixed curve @xmath8 .",
    "also , let @xmath48 and let @xmath7 be a closed subarc of @xmath8 such that @xmath49 is piecewise continuously differentiable on @xmath7 and the inverse function exists .",
    "the function @xmath50 maps a subinterval @xmath51 $ ] onto @xmath7 . if @xmath52 on @xmath53 then the limiting pair correlation function of the roots of @xmath54 , counting multiplicities , exists on @xmath7 , as @xmath55 , and is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the sum of divisors function .    the first part of the theorem , stating that the set of roots of all @xmath3 is dense on a fixed curve @xmath8 has been established in @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will present a proof in section 2 .",
    "the proof of the main part of the theorem involving the study of pair correlation is given in section 3 .",
    "the methodology of the proof is similar to that used in @xcite , and with the one employed in @xcite , where a more elaborate argument is needed since it addresses the effect of addition on pair correlation functions concerning fractions of bounded height .",
    "section 4 provides an example of the pair correlation function for a specific sequence of polynomials .",
    "in this section we consider the root distribution of the sequence of polynomials @xmath3 .",
    "we recall the @xmath59-analogue of the discriminant , a very useful concept introduced by mourad ismail @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59-discriminant of a polynomial @xmath60 of degree @xmath61 with the leading coefficient @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 are roots of @xmath60 .",
    "this @xmath59-discriminant equals 0 if and only @xmath65 for some roots @xmath66 . in the special case",
    "when @xmath67 , this @xmath59-discriminant gives the ordinary discriminant of a polynomial .",
    "the following theorem was established in @xcite .",
    "[ quadratic ]    let @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "the roots of @xmath3 are dense on the curve @xmath8 defined by the conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the complex plane .",

    "let @xmath72 and @xmath73 be the roots of @xmath74 . if @xmath75 then @xmath76 since @xmath77 .",
    "we consider @xmath78 .",
    "using partial fractions , we have @xmath79 so the roots of @xmath3 are the roots of @xmath80 , where @xmath59 is an @xmath81-th root of unity and @xmath82 , @xmath69 .",
    "these roots are the roots of the @xmath59-analogue of discriminant @xmath83 hence @xmath84 thus @xmath76 since @xmath59 is an @xmath81-th root of unity .    to show the density of the roots of @xmath3 , we let @xmath85 and @xmath86 be an open neighborhood of @xmath87 such that the rational function @xmath88 is analytic on @xmath86 . since the set of @xmath81-th roots of unity is dense on the unit circle as @xmath55 , the set of values @xmath89 is dense on the interval @xmath90 $ ] where @xmath59 is an @xmath81-th root of unity .",
    "by the open mapping theorem , the map @xmath88 maps @xmath86 to an open set containing some point @xmath89 for large @xmath16 . thus there is some point @xmath91 such that @xmath92 or @xmath93 this implies that @xmath59 is the quotient of the two roots of @xmath74 .",
    "hence @xmath46 is a root of @xmath3 by ( [ eq : quadratict ] ) .",
    "the root distribution of various sequences of polynomials with their generating functions are given by figures below .     with @xmath94     with @xmath95     with @xmath96    in the next section , we will analyze the pair correlation of the roots of @xmath97 , counting multiplicities .",

    "so it is essential to consider the pair correlation function of the sequence of finite sequences @xmath99 on a subinterval @xmath100 $ ] of @xmath101 .",

    ". we will need the following lemma .",
