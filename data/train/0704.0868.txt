    "there is currently interest in manipulating electron spins in quantum dots ( qds ) for quantum information and quantum computing purposes.@xcite a major goal in this research line is to optimize the spin relaxation time ( @xmath1 ) , which sets the upper limit of the spin coherence time ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3.@xcite therefore , designing two - level spin systems with long spin relaxation times is an important step towards the realization of coherent quantum operations and read - out measuraments . up to date , spin relaxation has been investigated almost exclusively in single - electron@xcite and two - electron@xcite qds .",
    "spin relaxation in qds with a larger number of electrons has seldom been considered@xcite , even though coulomb blockade makes it possible to control the exact number of carriers confined in a qd.@xcite yet , recent theoretical works suggest that coulomb interaction renders few - electron charge degrees of freedom more stable than single - electron ones@xcite , which leads to the question of whether similar findings hold for spin degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , in weakly - confined qds , acoustic phonon emission assisted by spin - orbit ( so ) interaction has been identified as the dominant spin relaxation mechanism when cotunneling and nuclei - mediated relaxation are reduced.@xcite the combined effect of coulomb interaction and so coupling has been shown to influence the energy spectrum of few - electron qds profoundly,@xcite but the consequences on the spin relaxation remain largely unexplored.@xcite    in ref .",
    "we investigated the effect of a magnetic field on the triplet - singlet ( ts ) spin relaxation in two and four - electron qds with so coupling , so as to understand related experimental works .",
    "motivated by the very different response observed for different number of confined particles , in this work we shall focus on the role of electron - electron interaction in spin relaxation processes , extending our analysis to different number of carriers , highlighting , in particular , the different physics involved in even and odd number of confined electrons .",
    "furthermore , we will explicitly compare the predictions of our theoretical model with very recent experiments on spin relaxation in two - electron gaas qds.@xcite    we study theoretically the energy structure and spin relaxation of @xmath4 interacting electrons ( @xmath5 ) in parabolic gaas qds with so coupling , subject to axial magnetic fields .",
    "both rashba@xcite and dresselhaus@xcite so terms are considered , and the electron - electron repulsion is accounted for via the full configuration interaction method.@xcite by focusing on the two lowest spin states , two different classes of systems are distinguished . for @xmath4 odd ( 1,3,5 ) and weak magnetic fields ,",
    "the ground state is a doublet and then the two - level system is defined by the zeeman - split sublevels of the lowest orbital . for @xmath4 even ( 2,4 ) , the two - level system is defined by a singlet and a triplet .",
    "we analyze these two classes of systems separately because , as we shall comment below , the physics involved in the spin transition differs .",
    "thus , we compare the phonon - induced spin relaxation of @xmath6 electrons and that of @xmath7 separately . as a general rule , the larger the number of confined carriers , the stronger the so mixing , owing to the increasing density of electronic states .",
    "this would normally yield faster relaxation rates .",
    "however , we note that this is not necessarily the case , and few - electron states may display comparable or even slower relaxation than their single - electron and two - electron counterparts .",
    "this is due to characteristic features of the few - particle energy spectra which tend to weaken the admixture between the initial and final spin states . in @xmath4-odd systems , it is the presence of low - energy quadruplets for @xmath8 that reduces the admixture between the zeeman sublevels of the ( doublet ) ground state , hence inhibiting the spin flipping . in @xmath4-even systems ,",
    "electronic correlations partially quench phonon emission@xcite , and the relaxation can be further suppressed for @xmath9 if one selects initial and final spin states differing in more than one quantum of angular momentum , which inhibits direct triplet - singlet so mixing via linear rashba and dresselhaus so terms.@xcite noteworthy , all these effects are connected with coulomb interaction between confined carriers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s : theo ]",
    "we give details about the theoretical model we use . in section [",
    "s : odd ] we study the energy structure and spin relaxation of a qd with an odd number of electrons ( @xmath6 ) . in section [ s : even ] we do the same for qds with an even number of electrons ( @xmath7 ) . in section [ s : exp ] we compare our numerical simulations with experimental data recently reported for @xmath10 gaas qds .",
    "finally , in section [ s : conc ] we present the conclusions of this work .",
    "we consider weakly - confined gaas / algaas qds , which are the kind of samples usually fabricated by different groups to investigate spin relaxation processes.@xcite in these structures , the dot and the surrounding barrier have similar elastic properties , and the lateral confinement ( which we approximate as circular ) is much weaker than the vertical one .",
    "a number of useful approximations can be made for such qds .",
    "first , since the weak lateral confinement gives inter - level spacings within the range of few mev , only acoustic phonons have significant interaction with bound carriers , while optical phonons can be safely neglected .",
    "second , the elastically homogeneous materials are not expected to induce phonon confinement , which allows us to consider three - dimensional bulk phonons .",
    "finally , the different energy scales of vertical and lateral electronic confinement allow us to decouple vertical and lateral motion in the building of single - electron spin - orbitals .",
    "thus , we take a parabolic confinement profile in the in - plane @xmath11 direction , with single - particle energy gaps @xmath12 , which yields the fock - darwin states.@xcite in the vertical direction ( @xmath13 ) the confinement is provided by a rectangular quantum well of width @xmath14 and height determined by the band - offset between the qd and barrier materials ( the zero of energy is then the bottom of the conduction band ) .",
    "the quantum well eigenstates are derived numerically . in cylindrical coordinates",
    ", the single - electron spin - orbitals can be written as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the lowest eigenstate of the quantum well , @xmath17 is the spinor eigenvector of the spin @xmath13-component with eigenvalue @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the @xmath20th fock - darwin orbital with azimuthal angular momentum @xmath21 ,    @xmath22    in the above expression @xmath23 denotes a generalized laguerre polynomial and @xmath24 is the effective length scale , with @xmath25 standing for the electron effective mass .",
    "the energy of the single - particle fock - darwin states is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath28 is the total ( spatial plus magnetic ) confinement frequency .",
    "with regard to coulomb interaction , we need to go beyond mean field approximations in order to properly include electronic correlations , which play an important role in determining the phonon - induced electron scattering rate.@xcite moreover , since we are interested in the relaxation time of excited states , we need to know both ground and excited states with comparable accuracy . our method of choice is the full configuration interaction approach : the few - electron wave functions are written as linear combinations @xmath29 , where the slater determinants @xmath30 are obtained by filling in the single - electron spin - orbitals @xmath31 with the @xmath4 electrons in _ all _ possible ways consistent with symmetry requirements ; here @xmath32 creates an electron in the level @xmath31 .",
    "the fully interacting hamiltonian is numerically diagonalized , exploiting orbital and spin symmetries.@xcite the few - electron states can then be labeled by the total azimuthal angular momentum @xmath33 , total spin @xmath34 and its @xmath13-projection @xmath35 .",
    "the inclusion of so terms is done following a similar scheme to that of ref . ,",
    "although here we consider not only rashba but also linear dresselhaus terms . for a quantum",
    "well grown along the @xmath36 $ ] direction , these terms read:@xcite    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are coupling constants , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the @xmath42-th cartesian projections of the electron spin and canonical momentum , respectively , along the main crystalographic axes ( @xmath43 for the lowest eigenstate of the quantum well ) .",
    "the momentum operator includes a magnetic field @xmath44 applied along the vertical direction @xmath13 .",
    "other so terms may also be present in the conduction band of a qd , such as the contribution arising from the system inversion asymmetry in the lateral dimension or the cubic dresselhaus term . however , in gaas qds with strong vertical confinement , @xmath45 and @xmath46 account for most of the so interaction.@xcite    we rewrite eqs.([eq:2],[eq:2bis ] ) in terms of ladder operators as :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 change @xmath21 and @xmath18 by one quantum , respectively , and @xmath50 is the dresselhaus in - plane coupling constant .",
    "it is worth mentioning that when only rashba ( dresselhaus ) coupling is present , the total angular momentum @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is conserved .",
    "however , in the general case , when both coupling terms are present and @xmath53 , all symmetries are broken . still ,",
    "so interaction in a large - gap semiconductor such as gaas is rather weak , and the low - lying states can be safely labelled by their approximate quantum numbers @xmath54 except in the vicinity of the level anticrossings.@xcite since the few - electron @xmath55 and @xmath35 quantum numbers are given by the algebraic sum of the single - particle states @xmath21 and @xmath18 quantum numbers , it is clear from eqs .",

    "the so terms of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3],[eq:3bis ] ) can be spanned on a basis of correlated few - electron states.@xcite the so matrix elements are then given by sums of single - particle contributions of the form :    @xmath59    here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constans for the rashba and dresselhaus interactions respectively , and @xmath62 are the form factors :    @xmath63 @xmath64    with @xmath65 .",
    "the above forms factors have analytical expressions which depend on the set of quantum numbers @xmath66 .",
    "the resulting so - coupled eigenvectors are then linear combinations of the correlated states , @xmath67 .",
    "we assume zero temperature , which suffices to capture the main features of one - phonon processes.@xcite indeed , it is one - phonon processes that account for most of the low - temperature experimental observations in the so coupling regime.@xcite we evaluate the relaxation rate between the initial ( occupied ) and final ( empty ) states of the so - coupled few - electron state , b and a , using the fermi golden rule :    @xmath68    where the electron states @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) have been written explicitly as linear combinations of slater determinants , @xmath71 stands for the @xmath72 electron state energy and @xmath73 represents the phonon energy .",
    "@xmath74 is the interaction operator of an electron with an acoustic phonon of momentum @xmath75 via the mechanism @xmath76 , which can be either deformation potential or piezoelectric field interaction .",
    "details about the electron - phonon interaction matrix elements can be found elsewhere.@xcite    in this work we study a gaas / al@xmath77ga@xmath78as qds , using the following material parameters:@xcite electron effective mass @xmath79 , band - offset @xmath80 mev , crystal density @xmath81 kg / m@xmath82 , acoustic deformation potential constant @xmath83 ev , effective dielectric constant @xmath84 , and piezoelectric constant @xmath85 v / m .",
    "the land factor is @xmath86.@xcite as for gaas sound speed , we take @xmath87 m / s for longitudinal phonon modes and @xmath88 m / s for transversal modes.@xcite unless otherwise stated , a lateral confinement of @xmath89 mev and a quantum well width of @xmath90 nm are assumed for the qd under study , and a dressehlaus coupling parameter @xmath91 ev@xmath92@xmath82 is taken@xcite , so that @xmath93 mev@xmath92 .",
    "the value of the rashba coupling constant can be modulated externally e.g. with external electric fields . here",
    "we will investigate systems both with and without rashba interaction .",
    "when present , we shall mostly consider @xmath94 mev@xmath92 , to represent the case where rashba effects prevail over dresselhaus ones .",
    "few - body correlated states @xmath54 are obtained using a basis set composed by the slater determinants ( sds ) which result from all possible combinations of 42 single - electron spin - orbitals ( i.e. , from the six lowest energy shells of the fock - darwin spectrum at @xmath95 ) filled with @xmath4 electrons . for @xmath96 ,",
    "this means that the basis rank may reach @xmath97 .",
    "the so hamiltonian is then diagonalized in a basis of up to 56 few - electron states , which grants a spin relaxation convergence error below 2% .",
    "since so terms break the spin and angular momentum symmetries , the so - coupled states @xmath69 are described by a linear combination of sds coming from different @xmath54 subspaces .",
    "thus , for @xmath96 , the states are described by up to @xmath98 sds . to evaluate the electron - phonon interaction matrix elements , we note that only a small percentage of the huge number of possible pairs of sds ( @xmath99 for @xmath96 ) may give non - zero matrix elements , owing to spin - orbital orthogonalities .",
    "we scan all pairs of sds and filter those which may give non - zero matrix elements writing the determinants in binary representation and using efficient bit - per - bit algorithms.@xcite the matrix elements of the remaining pairs ( @xmath100 for @xmath96 ) are evaluated using massive parallel computation .",

    "the dot has @xmath89 mev and @xmath90 nm . note the increasing size of the so - induced anticrossing gaps and zero - field splittings with increasing @xmath4.,width=207 ]",
    "when the number of electrons confined in the qd is odd and the magnetic field is weak enough , the ground and first excited states are usually the zeeman @xmath102 and @xmath103 sublevels of a doublet [ fig .  [ fig1 ] ] .",
    "since the initial and final spin states belong to the same orbital , @xmath104 and so mixing ( which requires @xmath105 ) is only possible with higher - lying states .",
    "in addition , the phonon energy ( corresponding to the electron transition energy ) is typically small ( in the @xmath31ev scale ) . in this case",
    ", the relaxation rate is determined essentially by the phonon density , the strength and nature of the so interaction , and the proximity of higher - lying states.@xcite in order to gain some insight on the influence of these factors , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we compare the energy structure of a qd with @xmath6 vs.  an axial magnetic field , in the presence of rashba and dresselhaus interactions.@xcite one can see that the increasing number of particles changes the energy magneto - spectrum drastically .",
    "this is because the quantum numbers of the low - lying energy levels change , resulting in a different field dependence , and because coulomb interaction leads to an increased density of electron states , as well as to a more complicated spectrum .    at first sight",
    ", the energy spectra of fig .  [ fig1 ] closely resemble those in the absence of so effects .",
    "for instance , the @xmath106 spectrum is very similar to the pure fock - darwin spectrum.@xcite rashba and dresselhaus interactions were expected to split the degenerate @xmath107 shells at @xmath95 , shift the positions of the level crossings and turn them into anticrossings@xcite , but here such signatures are hardly visible because so interaction is weak in gaas .",
    "in fact , the magnitude of the so - induced zero - field energy splittings and that of the anticrossing gaps is of very few @xmath31ev , and so effects simply add fine features to the @xmath106 spectrum.@xcite    a significantly different picture arises in the @xmath108 and @xmath96 cases . here",
    ", the increased density of electronic states enhances so mixing as compared to the single - electron case.@xcite as a result , the anticrossing gaps can be as large as 30 @xmath31ev ( @xmath108 ) and 60 @xmath31ev ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "moreover , unlike in the @xmath106 case , where the ground state orbital has @xmath109 , here it has @xmath110",
    ". therefore , the zeeman sublevels involved in the fundamental spin transition are subject to so - induced zero - field splittings .",
    "to illustrate this point , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we zoom in on the energy spectrum of the four lowest states of @xmath108 and @xmath96 under weak magnetic fields , without ( left panels ) and with ( right panels ) rashba interaction .",
    "clearly , the four - fold degeneracy of @xmath110 spin - orbitals at @xmath95 has been lifted by so interaction.@xcite one can also see that the order of the two lowest sublevels at @xmath111 changes when rashba interaction is switched on .",
    "thus , for @xmath108 and @xmath112 , the two lowest sublevels are @xmath113 and @xmath114 , but this order is reversed when @xmath94 mev@xmath92 .",
    "the opposite level order as a function of @xmath38 is found for @xmath96 .",
    "this behavior constitutes a qualitative difference with respect to the @xmath106 case in two aspects .",
    "first , the phonon energy ( i.e. , the energy of the fundamental spin transition ) is no longer given by the bare zeeman splitting .",
    "instead , it has a more complicated dependence on the magnetic field , and it is greatly influenced by the particular values of @xmath38 and @xmath115 .",
    "this is apparent in the @xmath96 panels , where the energy splitting between the two lowest states strongly differs depending on the relative value of @xmath38 and @xmath115 .",
    "second , it is possible to find situations where the ground state at @xmath116 has @xmath117 and the first excited state has @xmath118 ( e.g. @xmath108 when @xmath119 or @xmath96 when @xmath120 ) . in these cases",
    ", the zeeman splitting leads to a weak anticrossing of the two sublevels ( highlighted with dashed circles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) which has no counterpart in single - electron systems .",
    "this kind of @xmath44-induced ( i.e. , not phonon - induced ) ground state spin mixing , also referred to as `` intrinsic spin mixing '' , has been previously reported for singlet - triplet transitions in @xmath10 qds.@xcite here we show that they may also exist in few - electron qds with @xmath4 odd .",
    "interacting electrons , as a function of an axial magnetic field , without ( left column ) and with ( right column ) rashba so interaction . the approximate quantum numbers @xmath121 of the levels are shown , with arrows denoting the spin projection @xmath118 ( @xmath122 ) and @xmath117 ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the dashed circles highlight the region of intrinsic spin mixing of the ground state.,width=340 ]    figure [ fig1 ] puts forward yet another qualitative difference between so coupling in single- and few - electron qds : while in the former low - energy anticrossings are due to rashba interaction@xcite , in few - electron qds , when @xmath124 states come into play , both rashba and dresselhaus terms may induce anticrossings . for example , the @xmath125 sublevel couples directly to both @xmath126 and @xmath127 sublevels , via the dresselhaus and rashba interaction , respectively . coupling to @xmath124 states",
    "is a characteristic feature of @xmath8 systems , which has important effects on the spin relaxation rate , as we will discuss below .      in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the magnetic field dependence of the spin relaxation rate between the two lowest zeeman sublevels of @xmath6 .",
    "dashed lines ( solid lines ) are used for systems without ( with ) rashba interaction.@xcite while for @xmath106 the well - known exponential dependence with @xmath44 is found@xcite , and the main effect of rashba coupling is to shift the curve upwards ( i.e. , to accelerate the relaxation ) , for @xmath108 and @xmath96 the relaxation rate exhibits complicated trends which strongly depend on the values of the so coupling parameters .",
    "interacting electrons as a function of an axial magnetic field .",
    "solid ( dashed ) lines stand for the system with ( without ) rashba interaction .",
    "note the strong influence of the so interaction in the shape of the relaxation curve for @xmath8.,width=207 ]    to understand this result , one has to bear in mind that in spin relaxation processes two well - distinguished and complementary ingredients are involved , namely so interaction and phonon emission .",
    "phonon emission grants the conservation of energy in the electron relaxation , but phonons have zero spin and therefore can not couple states with different spin .",
    "it is the so interaction that turns pure spin states into mixed ones , thus enabling the phonon - induced transition .",
    "the overall efficiency of the scattering event is then given by the combination of the two phenomena : the phonon emission efficiency modulated by the extent of the so mixing .",
    "the shape of spin relaxation curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can be directly related to the energy dispersion of the phonon , which corresponds to the splitting between the two lowest levels of the electron spectrum .",
    "thus , for @xmath106 , the phonon energy is simply proportional to @xmath44 through the zeeman splitting , but for @xmath108 and @xmath96 it has a non - trivial dependence on @xmath44 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . actually , the relaxation minima in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are connected with the magnetic field values where the two lowest levels anticross in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in these magnetic field windows , in spite of the fact that so coupling is strong , the phonon density is so small that the relaxation rate is greatly suppressed.@xcite similarly , the relaxation rate fluctuations of @xmath108 at @xmath128 t are signatures of the anticrossings with high - angular momentum states . for larger fields ( @xmath129 t ) ,",
    "the ground state approaches the maximum density droplet configuration and high - spin states are possible.@xcite in this work , however , we restrict ourselves to the magnetic field regime where the ground state is a doublet .",

    "the relaxation of @xmath108 is slower than that of @xmath106 for a wide range of @xmath130 .",
    "the irregular data distribution is due to the irregular relaxation rates vs.  magnetic field .",
    "for example , the strongly deviated points of @xmath108 come from the peaks at @xmath131 in fig .",
    "[ fig3].,width=207 ]    for a more direct comparison between the relaxation rates of @xmath6 , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we replot the data of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as a function of the energy splitting between the two lowest states , @xmath130 , without ( top panel ) and with ( bottom panel ) rashba interaction . since the phonon energy is identical for all points with the same @xmath130 ,",
    "differences in the relaxation rate arise exclusively from the different strength of so interaction .",
    "@xmath130 is also a relevant parameter from the experimental point of view , since it is usually required that it be large enough for the states to be resolvable . in this sense",
    ", it is worth noting that , even if the inter - level splittings shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are fairly small , a number of experiments have successfully addressed this regime.@xcite    a most striking feature observed in the figure is that , for most values of @xmath130 , the @xmath108 relaxation rate is clearly slower than the @xmath106 one .",
    "likewise , @xmath96 shows a similar ( or slightly faster ) relaxation rate than @xmath106 .",
    "these are interesting results , for they suggest that improved spin stability may be achieved using few - electron qds instead of the single - electron ones typically employed up to date.@xcite at first sight the results are surprising , because the higher density of states in the few - electron systems implies smaller inter - level spacings , and hence stronger so mixing , which should translate into enhanced relaxation .",
    "it then follows that another physical mechanism must be acting upon the few - electron systems , which reduces the transition probability between the initial and final spin states , and may even make it smaller than for @xmath106 .",
    "here we propose that such mechanism is the so admixture with low - lying quadruplet ( @xmath124 ) states , which become available for @xmath8 . by coupling to @xmath124 levels , the projection of the doublet @xmath118 levels onto @xmath117 ones is reduced , and this partly inhibitis the transition between the lowest doublet sublevels .",
    "let us explain this by comparing the spin transition for @xmath106 and @xmath108 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the spin configuration of the initial and final states , in the absence of so coupling , is @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "the transition between these states is spin - forbidden .",
    "however , when so coupling is switched on , the two states become admixed with higher - lying @xmath134 states fulfilling the @xmath135 condition .",
    "the transition between the initial and final states can then be represented schematically as :    @xmath136    where @xmath137 are the admixture coefficients ( in general @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) . clearly now",
    "both spin configurations of the initial state have a finite overlap with the final state , and so the transition is possible .",
    "let us next consider the @xmath108 case . in the absence of so coupling ,",
    "the initial and final states are again the @xmath117 and @xmath140 doublets , respectively , and the transition is spin - forbidden .",
    "when we switch on so coupling , we note that the @xmath135 condition allows for mixing not only with @xmath141 states ( either doublets or quadruplets ) but also with @xmath142 quadruplets , so that the transition can be represented as :    @xmath143    where , in general , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 . in this case",
    ", @xmath146 has no overlap with the final state configurations .",
    "likewise , @xmath147 has no overlap with the initial state configurations .",
    "therefore , these quadruplet configurations are _ inactive _ from the point of view of the transition , and the more important they are ( i.e. , the stronger the so coupling with quadruplet states ) , the less likely the transition is .    to prove this argument quantitatively , in fig .",

    "on the other hand , as @xmath44 increases the singlet - triplet energy spacing is gradually reduced , and then the singlet experiences a series of weak anticrossings with all three zeeman sublevels of the triplet .",

    "it is worth pointing out that the complexity of the @xmath166 spectrum , as compared to the simple @xmath10 one , implies a greater flexibility to select initial and final spin states by means of external fields . as we shall discuss below",

    "increasing the number of electrons confined in the qd has three important consequences on the ts transition .",
    "first , it increases the density of electronic states ( and then the so mixing ) , leading to faster relaxation .",
    "second , as mentioned in the previous section , it introduces a wider choice of orbital quantum numbers for the singlet and triplet states .",
    "third , it increases the strength of electronic correlations .",
    "since now the initial and final spin states have different orbital wave functions , the latter factor effectively reduces phonon scattering , in a similar fashion to charge relaxation processes@xcite ( this effect has been recently pointed out in ref .",

    "we focus on the magnetic field regions where the ground state is a singlet and the excited state is a triplet . a complete description of the ts transition should then include spin relaxation between the zeeman - split sublevels of the triplet . however , for the weak fields we consider this relaxation is orders of magnitude slower than the ts one ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig8]),@xcite the reason for this being the small zeeman energy and the fact that the zeeman sublevels are not directly coupled by rashba and dresselhaus terms , as mentioned in section [ s : odd ] .",

    "this is in contrast to the @xmath4-odd case , where these terms may induce drastic changes in the shape of the relaxation rate curve ( see fig .",

    "one may then wonder if it is more convenient to use these systems instead of the @xmath10 ones dominating the experimental literature up to date@xcite , i.e. if it compensates for the increased density of electronic states .",

    "while @xmath166 shows similar relaxation rate to @xmath10 when the triplet has @xmath174 , the relaxation is slower by about one order of magnitude when the triplet has @xmath173 .",
    "this result indicates that the weakening of so mixing due to the violation of the @xmath105 condition clearly exceeds the strengthening due to the higher density of states , confirming that @xmath166 systems are more attractive than @xmath10 ones to obtain long triplet lifetimes .",
    "we also point out that , in spite of the different density of states , the relaxation rate of @xmath10 and @xmath176 triplets is quite similar .",
    "this can be ascribed to the phonon scattering reduction by electronic correlations,@xcite which may also explain the fact that experimentally resolved ts relaxation rates of @xmath177 qds and @xmath10 qds be quite similar.@xcite",

    ", the authors of the experimental work showed that the measuraments are in clear agreement with the behavior expected from so coupling plus acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "however , in such model : ( i ) the ts energy splitting was a taken directly from the experimental data , ( ii ) the so coupling effect was accounted for by parametrizing the admixture of the lowest singlet and triplet states only , and ( iii ) the @xmath44-dependence of the so - induced admixture was neglected .",
    "approximation ( ii ) may overlook the correlation - induced reduction of phonon scattering,@xcite that we have shown above to be significant , and which may have an important contribution from higher excited states in weakly - confined qds . in turn , approximation ( iii ) may overlook the important influence of so coupling in the @xmath44-dependence of the triplet lifetime , as we had anticipated in ref .  .",
    "here we compare with the experimental findings using our model , which includes these effects properly .",
    "we assume a qd with an effective well width @xmath178 nm , as expected by ref .",
    "authors , and a lateral confinement parabola of @xmath179 mev which , as we shall see next , fits well the position of the ts anticrossing . yet",
    ", the comparison is limited by the lack of detailed information about the rashba and dresselhaus interaction constants , and because we deal with circular qds instead of elliptical ones ( the latter effect introduces simple deviations from the circular case@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , in the experiment a tilted magnetic field of magnitude @xmath180 , forming an angle of @xmath181 with the vertical direction was used . here",
    "we consider the vertical component of the field ( @xmath182 ) , which is the main responsible for the changes in the energy structure , and the effect of the in - plane component enters via the zeeman splitting only .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] illustrates the average triplet lifetime for @xmath10 . the bottom axis shows the vertical magnetic field @xmath44 value , while the top axis shows the value to be compared with the experiment @xmath180.@xcite as can be seen , the triplet lifetime first decreases with the field and then it abruptly increases in the vicinity of the ts anticrossing , due to the small phonon density.@xcite this behavior is in clear agreement with the experiment ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 of ref .  ) .",
    "the position of the anticrossing ( @xmath183 t ) is also close to the experimental value ( @xmath184 t ) , which confirms that that @xmath179 mev is similar to the mean confinement frequency of the experimental sample .",
    "a departure from the experimental trend appears at weak fields ( @xmath185 t ) , where we observe a continuous increase of @xmath1 with decreasing @xmath44 , while the experiment reports a plateau .",

    "[ fig10 ] , we obtain good agreement with the experimental relaxation times by using small values of the so coupling parameters . in particular , a close fit is obtained using @xmath187 mev@xmath92 , which yields a spin - orbit length @xmath188 @xmath31 m .",
    "this value , which coincides with the experimental guess ( @xmath189 @xmath31 m ) , indicates that so coupling is several times weaker than that reported for other gaas qds.@xcite typical gaas parameters are often larger .",
    "for instance , measuraments of the rashba and dresselhaus constants by analysis of the weak antilocalization in clean gaas / algaas two - dimensional gases revealed @xmath190 mev@xmath92 , and @xmath191 ev@xmath92@xmath82 ( i.e , @xmath192 mev@xmath92@xmath193 for our quantum well of @xmath178 nm).@xcite to be sure , the small so coupling parameters in the experiment have a major influence on the lifetime scale .",

    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "actually , we note that accurate comparison with the timescale reported for other gaas samples@xcite is also possible within our model , but assuming stronger so coupling constants.@xcite in ref .",
    ", it was suspected that the weak so coupling inferred from the experimental data could be the result of the exclusion of higher orbitals and the magnetic field dependence of so admixture in their model ( higher states reduce the _ effective _ so coupling constants by decreasing the phonon - induced scattering@xcite ) .",
    "here we have considered both these effects and still small so coupling constants are needed to reproduce the experiment .",
    "therefore , understanding the origin of their small value remains as an open question .",
    "one possibility could be that the particular direction of the tilted magnetic field used in the experiment corresponded to a reduced degree of so admixture.@xcite",
    "we have investigated theoretically the energy structure and spin relaxation rate of weakly - confined qds with @xmath5 interacting electrons , subject to axial magnetic fields , in the presence of linear rashba and dresselhaus so interactions .",
    "it has been shown that the number of electrons confined in the dot introduces changes in the energy spectrum which significantly influence the intensity of the so admixture , and hence the spin relaxation .",
    "in general , the larger the number of confined carriers , the higher the density of electronic states .",
    "this decreases the energy splitting between consecutive levels and then enhances so admixture , which should lead to faster spin relaxation .",
    "however , we find that this is not necessarily the case , and slower relaxation rate may be found for few - electron qds as compared to the usual single and two - electron qds used up to date . the physical mechanisms responsible for this have been identified . for @xmath4-odd systems , when the spin transition takes place between zeeman - split sublevels , it is the presence of low - energy @xmath124 states for @xmath8 that reduces the projection of the doublet @xmath118 sublevels into @xmath117 ones , thus partly inhibiting the spin transition . for @xmath4-even systems ,",
    "when the spin transition takes place between triplet and singlet levels , there are two underlying mechanisms .",
    "on the one hand , electronic correlations tend to reduce phonon emission efficiency . on the other hand , for @xmath9 a magnetic field can be used to select a pair of singlet - triplet states which do not fulfill the @xmath105 condition of direct so admixture , which significantly weakens the so mixing .",
    "last , we have compared our estimates with recent experimental data for ts relaxation in @xmath10 qds.@xcite our results support the interpretation of the experiment in terms of so admixture plus acoustic phonon scattering , even though quantitative agreement with the experiment requires assuming much weaker so coupling than that reported for similar gaas structures .",
