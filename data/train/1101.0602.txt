    "neutrino data  @xcite is well in agreement with tribimaximal ( tb ) mixing  @xcite .",
    "if one assumes that the leptonic mixing is described at leading order by tb mixing , it is natural to consider that this special structure arises due to a family symmetry .",
    "although continuous groups have been used @xcite , discrete symmetries are particularly attractive for this purpose , with @xmath0 being especially popular and featured in several models of leptonic mixing  @xcite .    from the phenomenological viewpoint ,",
    "an attractive feature of the mass - independent mixing schemes ( also referred to as form - diagonalizable schemes ) is that they lead to predictive neutrino mass matrix structures which contain just five parameters ( the three neutrino masses and the two majorana phases ) , in the absence of dirac - type @xmath1 violation .",
    "the latter can then be directly related to neutrino observables such as the mass - squared differences , the absolute mass scale , and the effective mass parameter in neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath2 ) decays .    in this paper , we parametrize the general effective neutrino mass matrix diagonalized by tb mixing through three independent contributions which reflect the well - known magic and @xmath3-@xmath4 symmetries , as well as the democratic symmetry .",
    "we then connect some phenomenological features directly to the magnitude of the parameter controlling the democratic contribution .",
    "furthermore , we show that this analysis is also valid for other mass - independent mixing schemes by expressing a given form - diagonalizable structure in terms of the tb mixing rotated by an appropriate unitary matrix .",
    "we also discuss how to obtain in a natural way the above three independent contributions from discrete non - abelian symmetries .",
    "an alternative implementation of tb mixing in minimal @xmath0 ( type - i ) seesaw models based on the so - called form dominance can be found in ref .",
    "much of what applies to model building with tb mixing also transfers to other mass - independent schemes . to illustrate this",
    ", we build explicitly toy models that exhibit transpose tribimaximal  @xcite , bimaximal  @xcite , golden ratio  @xcite and hexagonal  @xcite mixing patterns .",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix with tb mixing can be written without loss of generality in the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the tb mixing matrix with angles @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , in the standard parametrization adopted in ref .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath11 can be separated into three components , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote the well - known magic , @xmath3-@xmath4 symmetric , and democratic matrices , respectively .    as it turns out , through the above decomposition , we are able to reveal interesting phenomenological properties that apply to many models , classified according to the parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and , particularly , @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , if either @xmath14 or @xmath15 vanishes , the neutrino mass spectrum has a twofold degeneracy [ see eq .   below ] . such a possibility is already excluded by the experimental data .",
    "thus , only the contribution proportional to @xmath16 , i.e. , the democratic contribution , can be absent in eq .  .",
    "in the physical basis , where the charged leptons are diagonal and real , the effective low - energy leptonic mixing can be written in the form @xmath17 with @xmath18 , being the majorana phases and @xmath19 . in turn , the neutrino masses read as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 .    experimentally , only the mass - squared differences have been directly measured .",
    "the solar and atmospheric mass - squared differences at @xmath26 confidence level are presently  @xcite @xmath27 with the best - fit values @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "there is also an indirect cosmological bound for the sum of the neutrino masses , @xmath30  ev  @xcite",
    ".    another important constraint can be obtained from @xmath2 experiments , which access the quantity @xmath31 despite large uncertainties from poorly known nuclear matrix elements , present data sets an upper bound on @xmath32 in the range 0.2 to 1 ev at 90% c.l .",
    "this will be improved in forthcoming experiments , with an expected sensitivity of about @xmath33  ev  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the sign of the neutrino mass difference @xmath34 is dictated by the ordering of the neutrino masses , being positive for normal ordering and negative for inverted ordering . in terms of the parameters @xmath35 and the phases @xmath36 , from eq .",
    ", one obtains @xmath37 the above relations allow us to reduce the number of free parameters from five to three . yet , even in this case , neutrino mass models are not very predictive . as we will discuss , the democratic component in eq .",
    "is naturally absent or suppressed in many flavor models .",
    "it is then of interest to study the latter cases and their phenomenological implications . when the democratic contribution is absent ( @xmath38 ) , the first relation in eq .",
    "becomes @xmath39 .",
    "since , by definition , @xmath40 , then @xmath41 . the second relation in eq",
    ".   thus implies @xmath42 , which enforces a normal hierarchy .",
    "we emphasize that this applies to all flavor models with mass - independent mixing schemes that do not contain in the effective neutrino mass matrix the democratic matrix @xmath43 or its rotated counterpart in other mixing schemes ( cf .",
    "[ omi ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in addition to tb mixing , there are other mass - independent structures that can reproduce the observed leptonic mixing angles .",
    "below we give some examples of such mass - independent schemes .",
    "the transposed tb mixing has the mixing angles @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath10  @xcite . in the well - known bimaximal structure  @xcite ,",
    "the mixing angles are @xmath46 and @xmath10 .",
    "there are also two golden ratio ( gr ) proposals where the angles can be related with @xmath47 .",
    "the first ( gr1 ) scheme corresponds to @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath10  @xcite , while the second ( gr2 ) has the associated angles @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "finally , the so - called hexagonal mixing  @xcite is described by the angles @xmath52 , @xmath51 , and @xmath10 .    the phenomenological analysis previously discussed is straightforwardly generalized to other mass - independent structures such as the five examples given above . indeed , if the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 is exactly diagonalized by the unitary matrix @xmath54 in a given mass - independent mixing scheme",
    ", one has @xmath55 reexpressing the mixing in terms of @xmath56 and an appropriate rotation @xmath57 , @xmath58 we can then rewrite @xmath59    we can see that the decomposition of the neutrino mass matrix into three independent components , as given in eq .  , is maintained as each component is rotated appropriately by @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the analysis in terms of the parameters @xmath60 also holds . from this simple manipulation , it should become clear that , although the mixing matrix is different , the main conclusions drawn for the tb mixing remain valid for any other mass - independent mixing structure , as well .",
    "in particular , the results that depend only on the neutrino mass spectrum are unchanged . on the other hand ,",
    "since the effective mass parameter @xmath61 depends directly on the first row of the mixing matrix , it is affected by the mixing scheme used . yet , as the mixing angles are constrained by the experimentally allowed ranges , all the mass - independent schemes presented above lead to very similar predictions for @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath62 symmetry is often used to obtain tb mixing , due to its relative simplicity - it is the smallest discrete group with a triplet irreducible representation ( irrep ) . as a function of the parameters @xmath63 , and @xmath64 introduced in eqs .   and , the tb effective lagrangian can be written as @xmath65 in order to show how the lagrangian structure of eq .",
    "( [ tb_xyz_terms ] ) arises in @xmath0 models , we reproduce below the most relevant group theoretical aspects ( a more detailed study can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "we then extend our analysis to the @xmath66 family symmetry groups .",
    "the @xmath0 group has a @xmath67 and a @xmath68 generator that are not simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "it has three singlet irreps and one triplet irrep , the latter being denoted as @xmath69 in the notation used in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath66 .",
    "as we shall see below , the triplet representation is labeled according to the @xmath70 generators , in the basis where they are diagonal .",
    "some of the invariants that can be constructed are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    in the basis",
    "where the @xmath67 generator is diagonal , the @xmath71 invariant becomes @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the components of the two triplets .",
    "we then immediately conclude from the group structure that the required effective neutrino mass term @xmath76 can be constructed if the lepton doublet @xmath77 is assigned to a @xmath69 irrep . here",
    ", @xmath78 is a generation index , and @xmath79 denotes the standard model ( sm ) higgs field .",
    "furthermore , adding a sm singlet @xmath69 scalar ( familon ) field @xmath80 , the invariant term @xmath81 can also be constructed , which becomes a mass term when the familon acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .    in the following , we assume that , through the appropriate scalar potential , the aligned vev @xmath82 is obtained .",
    "such a vev alignment leads to both the @xmath3-@xmath4 and magic structures given in eq .",
    "and yields the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ tb_xyz_terms ] ) with @xmath83 . in order to produce the democratic structure ,",
    "one can use higher order terms such as @xmath84 .",
    "it is , therefore , legitimate to consider that , in models based on @xmath0 , the parameter @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ mnu3 ] ) naturally vanishes or is small in comparison with other contributions .",
    "the group @xmath85 has a @xmath67 generator and two @xmath70 generators , denoted here by @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , respectively . in the @xmath70-diagonal basis ,",
    "the generators of this group can be written in a triplet representation as follows : @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 and the integers @xmath92 label the triplet representations .",
    "because of the particular form of the group generators , a triplet irrep can be labeled in three different ways , @xmath93 with @xmath94 , or 2 , and @xmath95 when building @xmath66 invariants , we need to consider two cases : @xmath96 or @xmath97 . the way the relevant invariants , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , are obtained",
    "will be shown next .",
    "hereafter , we shall use the simplified notation @xmath100 to denote @xmath101 .",
    "moreover , when presenting the invariant products in terms of components , we shall assume @xmath102 , with @xmath103 .",
    "in this case , there are three one - dimensional @xmath105 and @xmath106 three - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "we are only interested in the singlet contributions @xmath107 which verify the condition @xmath108 without ambiguity we choose @xmath109 .",
    "the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the invariant product of two triplets is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",

    "when the condition of eq .",
    "is satisfied , the triplet with @xmath118 is not present .",
    "we are particularly interested in products of two and three triplets where two of them are the same .",
    "there are two different possibilities when @xmath119 :    * case @xmath120 + in this case , only triplets of the type @xmath121 and equivalent representations are allowed . from eq .",
    ", we see that @xmath118 is not allowed so that the invariant products are @xmath122 * case @xmath123 + it is not possible to write the invariant of two triplets in this case .",
    "however , there is one extra invariant in the product of three triplets : @xmath124    notice that , in both cases , we have assumed @xmath125 , since these are the relevant invariants that will allow us to obtain tb mixing with a simple vev alignment .      when @xmath127 is an integer multiple of three , there exist nine one - dimensional @xmath128 and @xmath129 three - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "once again , we shall be interested in the singlet contributions . these are @xmath130 with the condition @xmath131    we have two different possibilities : @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 are either all multiples of @xmath136 , or not all of them are multiples of @xmath136 . in the former case , the condition for an invariant of the product of two triplets is @xmath137 with the clebsch - gordan coefficients given by @xmath138 for the invariant constructed from three triplets , the necessary condition is @xmath139 and the clebsch - gordan coefficients are @xmath140 the triplets associated with @xmath141 are the same as in the previous case .",
    "it is not possible to build an invariant from the product of two triplets when they are in the same irrep . on the other hand , for the product of three triplets ,",
    "we get @xmath142    the second case , i.e. , when not all @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 are multiples of @xmath136 , is similar to the case with @xmath96 .",
    "the necessary condition for the invariant product of two triplets is @xmath143 with the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the form @xmath144 the condition for the product of three triplets is @xmath145_p+\\frac{s\\,n}{3 } \\begin{pmatrix } 1\\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\,,\\ ] ] and the corresponding clebsch - gordan coefficients read @xmath146 as in the case of @xmath147 , we are only interested in the situation when @xmath148 .",
    "we consider again two different possibilities when @xmath119 .",
    "* case @xmath120 +",
    "if @xmath127 is odd , it is not possible to satisfy this condition . for @xmath127",
    "even we have @xmath149 .",
    "since the value @xmath118 is not allowed , we get @xmath150 * case @xmath123 + in this case it is not possible to write the invariant of two triplets .",
    "the extra invariant in the product of three triplets is now given by @xmath151      in the previous section , we presented a simple approach to build the invariants of the @xmath152 group .",
    "we also constructed the irrep combinations and their associated clebsch - gordan decomposition for the relevant invariants .",
    "the results were obtained in the basis where the @xmath70 generators are diagonal . yet , for model building , it is more convenient to change to the basis where the @xmath67 generator is diagonal .",
    "the only transformation that is needed in order to get the clebsch - gordan decomposition in the new basis is given by @xmath153 where @xmath154 denotes the triplet field in the old basis .",
    "in the new basis , the invariant for the product of two triplets is @xmath155 while for the product of three triplets the invariants are    @xmath156    in this basis , the charged lepton sector is diagonal and tb mixing is easily achieved in the neutrino sector from the products @xmath157 and @xmath158 with simple vevs .",
    "although the clebsch - gordan decomposition for other mass - independent mixing schemes is comparably more complicated in the new basis , it can be obtained through the rotation matrix @xmath57 , given in eq .  .",
    "moreover , the change to the convenient @xmath67-diagonal basis is performed analogously to the one in eq .  , where @xmath159 is now replaced by @xmath160 .",
    "this is a good basis choice to obtain other mass - independent mixing patterns , since the rotated @xmath157 directly leads to the rotated @xmath3-@xmath4 symmetric matrix @xmath161 , as in the tb mixing case .",
    "under general considerations , the effective neutrino mass term is written as the nonrenormalizable operator @xmath162 , where @xmath163 denotes additional fields that may be present and increase the dimensionality of the operator . to establish what kind of family invariants lead to desired structures , it is important to consider the mechanism responsible for the effective term . in what follows",
    "we assume a standard type - i , ii or iii seesaw mechanism ( for a brief review of the seesaw types and their connection with leptogenesis , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the type - i",
    "( type - iii ) seesaw , heavy right - handed fermion singlets ( triplets ) are added to the sm .",
    "the type - i seesaw lagrangian for the neutrino sector becomes @xmath164 where @xmath165 are the right - handed neutrino fields , @xmath166 is the dirac - neutrino yukawa coupling matrix , and @xmath167 is the heavy majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the type - iii seesaw lagrangian is similar , with the right - handed neutrino @xmath168 replaced by the fermion triplet , and the @xmath169 contractions appropriately changed .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary mass - independent leptonic mixing texture and assume three light neutrinos .",
    "following the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can then state the following : if the matrix @xmath167 has the same parametrization as the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath170 with @xmath171 , and @xmath43 defined in eqs .  , then the matrix @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the sm higgs vev , is also parametrized in the same way , @xmath174 and is thus symmetric .",
    "as discussed in detail in sec .  [ itb ] , the assumption about the texture of the matrix @xmath167 given in eq .",
    "is justified in the context of family models with a group structure .    in the type - ii seesaw framework , heavy scalar triplets @xmath175",
    "are added to the model , and the lagrangian in the neutrino sector becomes @xmath176 the neutrino mass matrix structure arising from these terms is controlled by the allowed contractions .      in order to obtain the tb mixing from the invariants , it is necessary to discuss first the representations of the charged leptons and the mechanism responsible for the generation of the effective neutrino mass term . within type - i seesaw ,",
    "it is possible to draw some conclusions about the matrix @xmath167 , since it is constructed from invariants with repeated representations .",
    "if @xmath168 belongs to singlet representations , there are too many parameters , and mass - independent textures can not be generated without fine - tuning .",
    "thus , @xmath168 must be a family triplet , and the invariant contractions can either be @xmath177 ( leading to @xmath161 ) or @xmath178 ( leading to @xmath179 and/or @xmath43 , depending on the group and the vevs of the @xmath80 fields ) . the form given in eq .",
    "( [ mr ] ) is obtained , and , as stated after eq .",
    "( [ md ] ) , the dirac - neutrino mass matrix @xmath180 needs to be symmetric .",
    "furthermore , if we attempt to construct the symmetric contribution , due to the magic matrix @xmath179 in @xmath180 , from a @xmath181 invariant of @xmath66 , the undesired antisymmetric contribution @xmath182 is also generated , thus spoiling the tb mixing .",
    "therefore , we must forbid both contributions by setting @xmath183 in eq .",
    "( [ md ] ) .    within type - ii seesaw ,",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix is obtained directly from repeated representations : @xmath184 must be a triplet representation with family invariant contractions @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "notice also that , although , in general , the sm higgs @xmath79 and the @xmath169 triplet scalar @xmath187 are considered as family symmetry singlets , and the triplet fields @xmath80 are added to the theory , it is possible to replace @xmath80 by assigning the @xmath169 multiplets @xmath79 and @xmath187 to family triplets . by doing so , the theory becomes renormalizable .",
    "considering in detail the representations , we can also formulate general arguments to justify the absence or suppression of the democratic contribution to @xmath11 .",
    "this has been already discussed for @xmath188 models . here",
    ", we generalize it for @xmath66 with @xmath189 .",
    "consider , for instance , @xmath190 , i.e. , the @xmath191 group .",
    "there are only 2 triplet irreps , @xmath69 and @xmath192 . in this case , the @xmath185 term is not allowed and the two choices for three - triplet invariants , @xmath72 or @xmath193 , are equivalent and always result in three simultaneous invariants with @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",
    "assume now @xmath196 , i.e. , @xmath197 .",
    "this group has 5 triplet irreps which can be labeled as @xmath69 , @xmath192 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , and @xmath200 .",
    "the three - triplet invariant with @xmath201 can result e.g. from one of the outcomes of the product @xmath202 .",
    "this invariant is never available with a repeated @xmath192 irrep , as required by the invariant @xmath203 .",
    "if we assign @xmath184 to @xmath69 , though , it is possible to obtain simultaneously all three structures at the cost of an extra field : when the @xmath198 scalar aligns in the @xmath204 direction , the product @xmath205 allows the @xmath206 invariant necessary for the @xmath179 matrix , while the product @xmath207 allows the @xmath118 invariant from which both @xmath161 and @xmath43 can be constructed , as soon as the scalars align in the @xmath208 and @xmath204 directions , respectively . within this context",
    ", @xmath197 is the smallest @xmath152 group for which the effective neutrino mass matrix naturally contains the democratic structure and thus allows for an inverted light - neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "type - i and type - iii seesaw flavor models that lead to an exact mass - independent leptonic mixing have a vanishing leptogenesis @xmath1 asymmetry in leading order  @xcite .",
    "this result does not necessarily hold in type - ii seesaw models . in the latter case ,",
    "the leptonic asymmetry is , in general , nonvanishing and , as it turns out , can be related to the democratic component of the neutrino mass matrix .",

    "if there are @xmath187 family triplets , there must be at least one extra singlet or triplet . otherwise , it is not possible to generate a mass - independent mixing in agreement with low - energy neutrino data .",
    "it can be shown that any contributions to eqs .",
    "and that involve components of the same triplet cancel out , but a nonvanishing asymmetry can result from the interaction of a given component of the triplet with the extra singlet or triplet . however , even in this case , the interaction of the triplet with the extra field will produce a traceless product in eq .  , unless one of the components is the democratic one (",
    "it should be noted that this requires an enlarged @xmath187 field content , since two family triplets are necessary , plus either a third triplet or a singlet field ) .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath187 is a family triplet , there are additional complications in constructing the interaction term @xmath218 , which makes the choice of @xmath187 as singlets more appealing .",
    "in sec .  [ omi ] , we have expressed a mass - independent mixing @xmath54 in terms of the tb mixing through eq .  .",
    "in this way , we obtain a simple recipe to transform an existing tb model to another mass - independent mixing scheme .",
    "the process requires an appropriate change of basis in the group generators and also the rotation of the vevs .",
    "the simplest way to obtain the rotated vevs is by means of the transformation given in eq .  .",
    "we write @xmath219 this is equivalent to having rotated the basis as in eq .   and solving for the vev that leads to the desired mass matrix structure .",
    "note that taking @xmath220 corresponds to tb mixing , and rotating the vev @xmath221 leads to @xmath222 as expected .    as an explicit example , we describe next how to obtain from the @xmath0 symmetry the gr1 mixing scheme .",
    "the necessary vevs do not appear natural and may be difficult to obtain from the group structure . existing models that produce the gr1 mixing from a discrete group such as @xmath223 also appear to require involved vevs and irreps with higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath224 and @xmath225 invariants in the rotated basis are not convenient to obtain a diagonal charged - lepton mass matrix for the gr1 model , but we can introduce additional fields with different vevs in order to use the trivial singlet contraction . in order to obtain the non - tb mass invariant structure , we need intricate vevs and extra fields to avoid the complicated @xmath224 and @xmath225 invariants .",
    "therefore , it is fair to say that the @xmath0 group leads more naturally to tb mixing .    for the gr1 example , we assign the sm particles as @xmath226 ; @xmath227 ; and @xmath228 .",
    "we introduce extra scalar fields @xmath229 , and @xmath80 that are triplets under @xmath0 and are responsible for its spontaneous breaking .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the cutoff energy scale .",
    "note that the lagrangian in the neutrino sector is equal to the one that generates tb mixing , but the charged lepton sector has been modified .",
    "the required scalar vevs are @xmath232 if the rotated democratic contribution is absent , the predictions described in sec .",
    "[ pheno ] are preserved .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .   can be used to predict other mixing structures with different vev alignments .",
    "for instance , the gr2 mixing is obtained assigning @xmath233 , while the bimaximal mixing corresponds to @xmath234 . on the other hand , assigning the vevs @xmath235 , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 , we can predict the transposed tb mixing . finally , the hexagonal mixing can be obtained with the enticingly simple vev @xmath239 , so that a complete model for hexagonal mixing may be constructed by simply adding the appropriate aligning terms to the scalar potential .",
    "we have shown that it is useful to decompose the effective neutrino mass matrix associated to the tribimaximal leptonic mixing into three independent parts [ see eq .  ] , including a democratic contribution .",
    "we concluded that this contribution controls interesting phenomenological consequences , such as the type of mass spectrum .",
    "in particular , we pointed out that the existence of a democratic contribution is necessary to obtain an inverted neutrino hierarchy .",
    "we then generalized those considerations to other mass - independent schemes , which are related to the tb form by a unitary transformation .",
    "we derived the same phenomenological results in terms of the rotated contribution of the given mass - independent structure .",
    "we have also considered , in a model - independent context , the consequences of using different groups and choices of representations .",
    "we discovered that , for @xmath152 groups producing tb mixing , the order @xmath127 of the group is very important and determines how natural it is to obtain a significant democratic contribution in the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the analysis based on the family symmetry invariants to other groups , such as @xmath240 , which includes @xmath241 .    from a model - building viewpoint",
    ", we have seen that the type of seesaw mechanism responsible for neutrino masses plays an important role , as it restricts the viable choices of family representations .",
    "it also has important consequences for leptogenesis . while in minimal type - i and type - iii seesaw scenarios that lead to a mass - independent leptonic mixing",
    "the leptonic @xmath1 asymmetries are zero in leading order , in a type - ii framework , leptogenesis is , in general , viable .",
    "we also concluded that the democratic contribution plays a relevant role in allowing unflavored type - ii leptogenesis to proceed .",
    "finally , we have extended our analysis of tb mixing to other mass - independent mixing schemes and have shown how a given tb model can be modified to yield such structures .",
    "this process has been illustrated by constructing a toy model that predicts the golden ratio mixing , which , although not as elegant as the respective tb model , is simple when compared to other models that predict the same mixing . the necessary vev alignment to obtain the golden ratio mixing has been presented , and , for completeness , we have also given the alignments that would lead to the bimaximal and transposed tribimaximal mixing patterns , as well as the relatively simple alignment needed for the hexagonal mixing .",
    "we have then concluded that , within this kind of rotated model , the special connection between the would - be democratic contribution and phenomenology is preserved .",
