    "in recent years the study of fractal structures has been an active field of research both theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in theory ,",
    "a variety of algorithms and dynamical models which produce fractal sets have been introduced .",
    "typically , in these models one can define an asymptotic limit in which the set exhibits fractal behavior on an arbitrarily broad range of length scales .",
    "one can then approach this limit by a process of gradual refinements of the set , which may involve either an increase in system size or decrease in the minimal object size . in the case of _ empirical fractals _",
    "observed experimentally the situation is different . for these fractals",
    "the range over which they obey a scaling law is restricted by inherent upper and lower cutoffs . in most experimental situations",
    "this range may be quite small , namely not more than one or two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even in these cases the fractal analysis condenses data into useful relations between different quantities and often provides useful insight @xcite .    motivated by the yet largely inexplicable abundance of experimentally observed fractals",
    ", we consider in this paper the apparent fractal properties of systems which are governed by uniformly random distributions .",
    "the choice of random systems is justified by the abundance of randomness in nature , and by the fact that uniform randomness is a convenient limit , on top of which correlations can be introduced as perturbations .",
    "although a purely random system can not be fully scale invariant , it may , as we show below , display apparent fractality over a limited range .",
    "the width and the cut - off values of this range seems to be in good agreement with the typical width and typical cut - offs observed in experimental measurements ( between one and two decades ) , unlike the case with models which are inherently scale free .    to illustrate these ideas we consider a model in which @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) spheres of diameter @xmath2 are randomly distributed in an @xmath0-dimensional space in the regime of low volume fraction occupied by the spheres . in three dimensions ( 3d )",
    "our definitions coincide with ordinary spheres , while for @xmath3 ( 2d ) we consider disks , and for @xmath4 ( 1d ) rods of length @xmath2 . in the basic model",
    "the positions of the spheres are uncorrelated and they are thus allowed to overlap .",
    "we then extend the model to the case where there is a distribution of sphere radii and examine the effect of this distribution on the fractal properties .",
    "we also examine a version of the model in which spheres are not allowed to overlap , thus introducing short range correlations between sphere positions .",
    "this class of models may approximately describe spatial distribution of objects such as craters on the moon , droplets in a cloud and adsorbates on a substrate .",
    "in particular , the one dimensional model may describe the level distribution in energy spectra of quantum systems and the zeroset of random temporal signals .",
    "therefore , such models may be at the root of empirical observations of fractals in experiments and data analyses , dealing with processes governed mainly by randomness @xcite .",
    "as fractality is usually revealed by applying various resolution analyses , we also address the question of whether our observations are method - dependent .",
    "two of the most commonly employed resolution analysis methods are the box - counting ( bc ) and minkowski sausage ( ms ) techniques @xcite .",
    "the fractal properties of these models are studied here both analytically and numerically , within the bc and ms frameworks .",
    "the analytical solution is exact except for the case of impenetrable spheres in @xmath5 dimensions where some approximations were needed .    in the box - counting ( bc ) procedure one covers the embedding space by non - overlapping boxes of linear size @xmath6 , and then counts the number of boxes @xmath7 , which have a non - empty intersection with the ( fractal ) set .",
    "a fractal dimension @xmath8 , is declared to prevail at a certain range , if a relation of the type    @xmath9    holds , or equivalently , if the slope of the log - log plot    @xmath10 \\ } \\label{eq : d_bc}\\ ] ]    is found to be constant over that range . in the ms case @xcite one",
    "draws an @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath0=1,2,3 ) minkowski - sphere ( m - sphere ) of radius @xmath11 around each point in the set under consideration , and calculates how the volume @xmath12 of the union of all spheres changes under a variation of @xmath11 .",
    "the set is considered fractal with a dimension @xmath13 , over a range of scales , if    @xmath14    or equivalently , if    @xmath15 \\ }   \\label{eq : d_m}\\ ] ]    is constant within this range .",
    "the bc and ms methods are known to be identical from the mathematical point of view @xcite , where the limits @xmath16 can be taken .",
    "their equivalence from the physical point of view , under the constraints of finite cut - offs , is not obvious . while it is clear from eqs.([eq : n = rtod])-([eq : d_m ] ) that both methods employ resolution analysis , in which the number of occupied `` resolution units '' ( boxes or spheres ) has to be determined as a function of the resolution magnitude ( box - length or m - sphere - radius ) , there are slight differences between the two methods , which are due to both geometrical differences and the presence of cut - offs .",
    "using a resolution analysis one should be aware of the existence of physical cut - offs .",
    "this is especially important in the structures considered below which are not fractal in the rigorous mathematical sense .",
    "we will show that the log - log plots of the functions @xmath7 and @xmath17 display linear behavior between these physical cut - offs .",
    "the slope in this range can be interpreted as an fd .",
    "the existence of this scaling behavior between physically relevant cutoffs is a central motivation for the study of the random models presented below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ basic - model ] we consider the basic model of penetrable spheres where all the spheres are of equal size , and calculate the bc function . from the analysis of this function we obtain the nontrivial linear range and extract the apparent fd .",
    "the generality of this model is then demonstrated using an information theory argument . in section [ poly ]",
    "we generalize the analysis to the case where the spheres are not equally sized but exhibit various size distributions and examine the effect on the apparent fractal behavior .",
    "certain correlations are then introduced in section [ impenetrable ] where the case of impenetrable spheres in considered and the conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this model @xcite @xmath18 rods of length @xmath19 are randomly placed on the unit interval ( fig.[fig : rods ] ) @xcite such that the positions of the rod centers are chosen from a uniform random distribution .",
    "the rods are mutually penetrable , namely overlaps are allowed .",
    "the bc function @xmath7 , will now be derived .",
    "this function gives the number of boxes , for given box size @xmath6 , which have a non - empty intersection with the set .",
    "for a large enough number of rods ( of the order of 100 in the present case ) , the deviations from the expectation value @xmath20 are negligible and edge effects are unimportant .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the probability that a box of size @xmath6 intersects a rod of length @xmath2 .",
    "then for a total of @xmath22 boxes ,    @xmath23    following refs.@xcite define the probability @xmath24 that after random placement of the first rod , a given box remains unintersected . neglecting edge effects",
    ", this implies that the center of the rod must be at least a distance of @xmath25 away from either edge of the box ( fig.[fig : rods](c ) ) .",
    "a total length of @xmath26 is , therefore , unavailable for placement without intersection . for a uniformly random distribution",
    "it follows that :    @xmath27    the next rods are placed independently , which means that after placement of @xmath18 rods , the probability that the box is still unintersected is    @xmath28    finally , the probability of at least one intersection is @xmath29 , and therefore :    @xmath30 . \\label{eq:<n>}\\ ] ]    this is the one dimensional bc function for randomly adsorbed , mutually penetrable rods @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the model along with the theoretical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq:<n > ] ) , are shown in fig.[fig : nresults ] .",
    "the excellent agreement is evident .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath18 are independent , and are limited only by the restriction @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the coverage of the line . we find that for large m ( here @xmath33 ) changing @xmath2 and @xmath18 while keeping @xmath34 fixed , merely translates rigidly the bc function in the log - log plane .    in fig.[fig : nresults.reg ] , the bc function is shown in a range between cut - offs , together with a linear regression .",
    "this is the range which is commonly measured in experimental work .",
    "the special significance of these cut - offs is discussed below .",
    "notice the nearly linear appearance , extending over close to 1.5 decades .      in the two dimensional model one places _ disks _ of diameter @xmath2 on the unit square , so",
    "that for a given box of area @xmath35 to remain unintersected , no disk center may fall within the area shown in fig.[fig : rods](d ) .",
    "thus , a total area of @xmath36 is excluded for placement of the first disk center . therefore in this case",
    "the probability of the box to remain empty is :    @xmath37    the next disks are placed independently , leading to :    @xmath38 . \\label{eq:<n>-2d}\\ ] ]    similarly , for 3d one considers independent placement of spheres , and the excluded volume for sphere centers is that formed by convolution of a cube of side @xmath6 and a sphere of diameter @xmath2 , which is @xmath39 .",
    "one obtains then    @xmath40    and    @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{eq:<n>-3d}\\ ] ]        we will now study the bc function @xmath7 and examine the possibility of fractal - like behavior .",
    "for simplicity we will first concentrate on the 1d case , but the conclusions apply to 2d and 3d as well .    for mathematical fractals displaying full scale - invariance ,",
    "the log - log plot of @xmath7 vs. @xmath6 can form a straight line with a fractal slope over an unlimited range of scales in the asymptotic limit .",
    "for the set we consider , this is clearly not the case as in fig.[fig : nresults ] : there are `` knees '' beyond which the slope approaches 1 .",
    "this is due to the existence of lower and upper cut - offs , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "these cut - offs correspond to relevant physical limits of observation . here , the smallest feature is of size @xmath2 , and so the finest resolution is of that size .",
    "no additional information is obtained by reducing @xmath6 below @xmath44 , where @xmath45 approaches the trivial limit of @xmath46 as @xmath47 . to see why this is so , suppose , for convenience , that the center of each rod is located at a point connecting two adjacent boxes : then halving the box doubles the number of intersected boxes if @xmath48 , with the result that @xmath45 must approach the limit of @xmath46 as @xmath49 . when the centers of the rods are located arbitrarily , the lower cut - off",
    "will not be sharply located at @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless ,    @xmath50    is a good estimate for it .",
    "as for the upper cut - off @xmath43 , it is the size beyond which practically all boxes intersect at least one rod , where again @xmath51 .",
    "this happens when the boxes are larger than the average gap between rods :    @xmath52    which is therefore an approximate upper cut - off .",
    "we thus have the approximate range @xmath53 , where the measurement is properly tuned to measure inherent scaling behavior , if it exists .",
    "for scaling behavior to be observed , there must be a minimal range of apparent linearity ( eq.([eq : d_bc ] ) ) .",
    "the size of such a range and the extent of linearity displayed by the bc function in it are considered below .",
    "the standard experimental procedure is to apply a linear regression analysis on the log - log presentation of the scaling range .",
    "the linear regression line is constructed to go through the inflexion point @xmath54 of the log - log plot of eq.([eq:<n > ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the range of linearity @xmath55 on the coefficient of determination , @xmath56 , ( measuring the quality of the linear description ) is then explored .",
    "the range of linearity is approximately given by @xmath57 .",
    "applying a linear regression analysis on the log - log plot of the bc function , we evaluated the slopes and actual ranges of linearity under these constraints , with different values of @xmath58 imposed .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.[fig : range ] .",
    "for instance , about two decades of linear behavior can be observed for a required value of @xmath56 of below 0.97 .",
    "examples of experimentally observed fractal objects exhibiting several orders of magnitude of linearity are rare ; the vast majority of reported fractality spans 1 - 2 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , in fact , we are mimicing in our calculations the common practice of searching and reporting fd s in empirical data .    the convention for the smallest meaningful scaling range is _ one decade_@xcite . given this , a simple argument yields the maximum allowed coverage : by using the estimates above for the cut - offs , @xmath44 and @xmath59 , one observes that a range @xmath60 $ ] of at least one decade , requires that : @xmath61 .",
    "it follows that the apparent fractality in our model is _ restricted to @xmath62_. the range between the cut - offs grows as the coverage is _ decreased _ , as observed in fig.[fig : nresults ] .",
    "in addition to the width of the range between the cutoffs , the quality of the linear fit within this range , measured by @xmath56 should also be considered .",
    "one can limit the range of linearity by imposing a lower bound on @xmath56 : obviously , the range decreases as @xmath56 increases ( fig.[fig : range ] ) .",
    "also note from this figure , that for a given range , the quality of linearity grows as the coverage is _ increased _ , or as the slope of the bc function between the cut - offs ( i.e. , the fd ) approaches 1 ( fig.[fig : nresults ] ) .",
    "this happens because of the smooth merging with the slope beyond the cut - offs , which is trivially 1 .",
    "we thus conclude that the two cut - offs limit the width of the linear range for high coverage while the @xmath56 criterion limits it for low coverage . as a result",
    ", the range of scales in which we observe apparent fractality is typically between one and two orders of magnitude .",
    "the apparent fd shown in fig.[fig : d ] , for an imposed values of @xmath63 , rises monotonically from 0 as more rods are added .",
    "this is an important aspect of the model : it does not predict a universal ( specific ) fd , but the whole allowable range of fd values .",
    "the regression results are further compared in fig.[fig : d ] to an analytical equation , obtained by calculating the logarithmic derivative of @xmath7 at the _ estimated _ middle point @xmath64 :    @xmath65 ) \\over d(\\log[1/r])}\\left|_{r = r_e}\\right .",

    "\\label{eq : dresult}\\ ] ]    we use an estimate for the middle point ( @xmath66 ) rather than the exact result ( @xmath67 ) , since @xmath67 can not be given analytically .",
    "the almost symmetric s - shape of the log - log plot in the scaling region assures that @xmath66 is a good estimate for @xmath67 . as seen in fig.[fig : d ] , the fd predicted by eq.([eq : dresult ] ) is an accurate lower bound to the regression result .    by using @xmath68 as @xmath69 , eq.([eq :",
    "dresult ] ) may be simplified in the `` thermodynamic limit '' , while keeping @xmath34 finite .",
    "one then obtains :    @xmath70    notably , the expression for @xmath71 depends on @xmath34 alone . in the limit of small @xmath34",
    ", one can further simplify eq.([eq : deta ] ) and obtain    @xmath72    expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 may be derived from eqs.([eq:<n>-2d]),([eq:<n>-3d ] ) for the 2d and 3d cases .",
    "these , as well as a discussion of their cut - offs and range of linearity are deferred to sec.[poly - bc ] , where a more general model is treated .",
    "since fractal objects typically exhibit some correlations , one might wonder whether the finding of an apparent fd in our model , is also due to some hidden correlations within a certain window of resolution .",
    "for instance , it might seem plausible that the finite extent of the rods introduces a correlation , for if a point on the line belongs to a certain rod , then a point at a distance @xmath75 is likely to belong to the same rod .",
    "however , correlations at a scale @xmath75 below the lower cut - off are , rightly so , typically not measured .",
    "furthermore , as we show next , the correlation exponent for @xmath76 vanishes . this will prove that the emergence of an fd in the penetrable rods case is _ not _ due to the presence of correlations , but entirely due to the scaling displayed by the underlying uniform distribution .    a correlation exponent , @xmath77 ,",
    "is associated with a given set if a correlation function @xmath78 has the following power - law form over a sufficiently large range :    @xmath79    an exact expression for this function may be derived for penetrable rods .",
    "let @xmath80 be the local density at the point @xmath81 on the line .",
    "that is , @xmath82 if @xmath81 belongs to a rod , and zero otherwise .",
    "the correlation function is defined as :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 denotes either an ensemble average ( at fixed @xmath81 ) , or an average over @xmath81 .",
    "assuming ergodicity , we choose to calculate the latter .",
    "only pairs of points @xmath85 such that both @xmath80 and @xmath86 are @xmath46 contribute to the average .",
    "we thus require the simultaneous probability :    @xmath87 .",

    ", @xmath81 is considered to be any convenient reference point , though none of the results depends on its location . with this general choice of @xmath81 ,",

    "now consider randomly placing rods of length @xmath2 on the line .",
    "the events which are complementary to _ both _",
    "points @xmath85 being occupied , are ( 1 ) that at least one is unoccupied ( with probability @xmath95 ) , and ( 2 ) that both are unoccupied ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "clearly @xmath95 already accounts for @xmath96 , so that :    @xmath97 .",
    "\\label{eq : p - q}\\ ] ]    the evaluation of @xmath95 is a repetition of the argument leading to eq.([eq : qnd ] ) , with a vanishing box size ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "thus :    @xmath99    when @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath96 requires that no rod center is placed within a distance smaller than @xmath25 to either test - point ( see fig.[fig : rods](e , f ) ) .",
    "when @xmath76 , this clearly excludes a total length of @xmath101 from possible placement of rod centers . when @xmath75 , a length of only @xmath102 is excluded , due to overlap of the two inner segments . in all other",
    "respects the argument leading to eq.([eq : qnd ] ) ( with @xmath98 ) is again repeated , so that :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is the average distance between rod centers , and    @xmath105    combining eqs.([eq : c - p]-[eq : s(x ) ] ) , one finally obtains for the correlation function :    @xmath106    thus for @xmath107 , @xmath78 is constant , i.e. , _ the correlation exponent vanishes _ ( a result obtained numerically by meakin and deutch@xcite ) .",
    "however , the non - trivial range of the similarity dimension _ starts _ at @xmath2 , and hence can not possibly be due to correlations .",
    "these exist , not surprisingly , for @xmath75 , but even there they decay _ exponentially _ ( with a characteristic length of @xmath108 ) , and not as a power - law , as required for fractality measured by the scaling of correlation functions .",
    "this completes the demonstration that the non - trivial result we obtained for the similarity dimension of penetrable rods is _ not _ due to correlations .",
    "the elements of this demonstration are applicable also to the more general model presented in the next section and are not repeated there : the absence of correlations holds for all penetrable cases treated in this study .      in this section arguments are presented showing that the model of randomly placed , mutually penetrable spheres introduced in sec.[basic - model ] , is very general in the sense that it is a prototype of a much larger family random processes .",
    "being minimalistic in assumptions , the model is in fact a _ generic _",
    "one for random processes .",
    "an information - theoretical approach is now employed to show this , using the fact that the only assumption entering the model is the _ knowledge of a mean quantity_. an important feature of the information - theoretical approach is that it extends the model from spatial to _ temporal _ random sequences , and even to energy - level distributions @xcite .",
    "thus , in an adsorption process the relevant mean quantity is the average density of adsorbates and one seeks the distribution of nearest - neighbor distances .",
    "an equivalent situation is that in which one knows the average period of a time signal and is interested in the distribution of intervals between successive crossings of the time axis ( the `` zeroset '' ) .",
    "a finite width @xmath2 is then the signal width at the crossings .",
    "yet another case is that of spectral - level distribution ( where @xmath2 is the uncertainty band width ) , for which it is well known that spacings of quantum energy levels in classically non - chaotic systems are exponentially distributed @xcite .",
    "indeed , it will be shown that an exponential distribution of the intervals between the centers of the spheres is an inherent characteristic of our model .",
    "it shall then become clear that spatial , temporal and spectral random processes fall into the same class .",
    "the spatial and temporal cases differ only in that a time - process must be _ ordered _ on the time axis , while the positions of `` events '' on a spatial axis are not necessarily ordered .",
    "there are , however , @xmath109 possible arrangements in the spatial case , obtained by interchanging the labels of events on the spatial axis .",
    "the time - process may be considered as the one ordered set out of all these permutations .",
    "relabeling is all that is required to map a spatial process to one in time , and clearly this does not affect the statistics of positions or intervals .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known @xcite that the fd of the actual time signal can be deduced from that of its zeroset . relying on the equivalence",
    "just discussed , we choose in what follows for concreteness to work on the spatial process of placement , but one should keep in mind that the discussion applies just as well to time - processes and energy - level spacings .",
    "consider now the derivation of the distribution satisfying the assumption of knowledge of the mean . in the present case",
    "this is the known average placement density    @xmath110    ( or equivalently , this may represent the average period of a time signal . )",

    "is obtained by maximizing the missing information , @xmath113 ,    @xmath114    where the constraint of knowing @xmath115 can be written as :    @xmath116    to this one must add the normalization constraint    @xmath117    using lagrange multipliers @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the maximization of @xmath113 can then be written in terms of a functional @xmath120 as :    @xmath121 = - \\int_0^{\\infty } dx\\ : \\ { p(x ) \\ , \\ln p(x ) + \\lambda \\,p(x ) + \\mu \\,x\\ , p(x ) \\",

    "it remains to be shown , returning to the adsorption - language , that given this exponential distribution of intervals between the centers of the rods , the adsorbate _",
    "positions _ are _ uniformly _ distributed .",
    "it is a standard exercise in probability theory to show that a uniform distribution of positions leads to an exponential distribution of intervals ( see e.g. ref.@xcite , or recall the argument for the time of flight of a particle undergoing random collisions with a given mean free path ) .",
    "it is now shown that the opposite holds as well , namely that the exponential distribution of intervals , derived above from an information - theory argument , leads to a uniform distribution of positions . the argument that led to the derivation of the exponential distribution of intervals , eq.([eq : p - final ] ) , assumed that only the mean distance between points is known , and that this is the only parameter of relevance .",
    "therefore , it was in fact implicitly assumed that successive placements are independent ( for otherwise additional constraints should have appeared , reflecting the dependence of the distribution of intervals on the number of previous placements ) .",
    "let @xmath111 denote the probability density of finding a point between @xmath112 and @xmath126 after a single placement .",
    "given that there is a point at @xmath81 , consider the conditional probability density @xmath127 of finding the nearest neighboring point between @xmath128 .",
    "this can be expressed as :    @xmath129    where @xmath130 is the probability density of finding a gap of length @xmath112 .",
    "but since this exponential probability depends only on the ( non - negative ) _ distance _ between neighboring points , it is clear that nothing prevents interchanging the roles of @xmath81 and @xmath131 , i.e. , it must hold that :    @xmath132    or , explicitly :    @xmath133    one is at liberty to choose @xmath134 , so that @xmath135 , which holds for every @xmath112",
    ". therefore @xmath111 is _ constant _ , i.e. , the positions are uniformly distributed .",
    "this result followed from the exponential distribution which was derived under the minimalistic assumption of knowledge of the mean of a relevant property .",
    "drawing on the generality of this derivation , we conclude that _ a uniform random distribution of adsorbate centers is a generic model of random processes in space and time _ , where one only assumes knowledge of the mean .",
    "a uniform distribution of adsorbate centers is , however , exactly what was assumed in the adsorption model in sec.[basic - model ] , for which apparent fractality was detected .",
    "fractality may therefore be expected for any other random system which can be characterized by its mean .",
    "one may further employ the above information - theory formalism in order to derive the distributions appropriate to knowledge of higher moments , if correlations are present in the system .",
    "the basic model introduced in sec.[basic - model ] is now generalized , by allowing polydispersivity in radii . that is , we consider a model of randomly placed @xmath0-dimensional spheres with a _ distribution of radii _ @xmath136 .",
    "the radii are assumed to be chosen independently from @xmath136 . in 1d , this may , e.g. , represent a random spectrum with levels exhibiting a distribution of lifetimes . in 2d",
    ", such systems may approximately describe , for example , the formation of metal clusters on metal surfaces @xcite . in 3d",
    "one might consider the distribution of atmospheric or intergalactic dust aggregates .",
    "thus the polydispersed case represents a very wide class of systems , whose possible scaling properties and apparent fd are quantities of interest .",
    "both the bc and ms functions and fds will be calculated , first generally , and then for a number of specific but broadly used radii distributions .",
