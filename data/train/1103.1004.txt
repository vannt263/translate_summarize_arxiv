    "a potential barrier generally inhibits transmission of a particle and leads to total reflection in the low - momentum limit , this perfect transmission in the bec , termed anomalous tunneling  @xcite , has attracted much attention and has been studied extensively and intensively  @xcite .",
    "the following crucial facts for the anomalous tunneling of the excitation in a bec ( i.e. , the bogoliubov excitation ) have been discussed : the fact that the wave function of the bogoliubov excitation has the same form as the condensate wave function in the low - momentum limit  @xcite and the fact that the wave function of its excitation with small but finite momentum behaves as the condensate one with a small supercurrent  @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , these facts were found through studies of a specific system ( i.e. , a scalar bec ) so that discussions and understandings of anomalous tunneling are restrictive .",
    "if we can find another system showing anomalous tunneling , it will lead to a deeper understanding of anomalous tunneling .",
    "an efficient approach in this direction is to examine tunneling phenomena in a bec of particles with spin-1 degrees of freedom ( the so called spin-1 spinor bec ) .",
    "the spin-1 spinor bec of dilute atomic gases was realized in 1998  @xcite . in the same year",
    ", ohmi and machida  @xcite and also ho  @xcite determined ground states and excitations in the spin-1 spinor bec through mean - field theory . in this bec",
    ", there are two phases for ground states , a ferromagnetic phase and a polar phase , each of which has three - types of excitations .",
    "for instance , the ferromagnetic phase has the bogoliubov mode whose energy @xmath0 is linear in the momentum @xmath1 , the transverse spin mode with @xmath2 , and the quadrupolar spin wave whose energy is massive .    the following questions will be answered through studies of the spin-1 spinor bec : is the linear dispersion essential for anomalous tunneling of excitations ?",
    "( does an excitation with @xmath2 tunnel through the potential barrier without reflection in the limit @xmath3 ? ) do excitations that exhibit anomalous tunneling always have gapless spectra ?",
    "if we can deduce the essence of anomalous tunneling from the answers to these questions , then it will useful for predicting tunneling properties in other systems .        in this paper , we thus investigate tunneling problems of excitations in the spin-1 spinor bec .",
    "an example of this problem is schematically shown in fig .",
    "an excitation runs toward a potential barrier from one side and is transmitted through and reflected against the barrier .",
    "excitations are scattered off not only the potential barrier but the condensate wave function deformed by the potential barrier .",
    "the density of the bec is depleted only around the potential barrier because of the nonlinear effect due to the interparticle interaction .",
    "we study both the ferromagnetic and the polar phases , but we focus rather on the saturated magnetization state @xmath4 , and an unsaturated magnetization state @xmath5 , which are , respectively , associated with the ferromagnetic and the polar phases in the absence of the magnetic field . here , @xmath6 is the normalized magnetization , where the magnetization is fully polarized when @xmath4 . as well as transmission coefficients ,",
    "we examine wave functions of excitations in the low - energy limit to study a characteristic specific to excitations showing anomalous tunneling .",
    "table  [ tablei ] summarizes our main results in this paper .",
    "we find that all excitations but the quadrupolar spin mode show anomalous tunneling in the low - momentum limit . we also find that these excitations have the following two features : ( i ) the energy gap is zero in the absence of external fields and ( ii ) the wave functions of excitations in the low - momentum limit have the same forms as condensate wave functions .",

    "it is worthwhile to compare these two modes through an exactly solvable model , since it gives a clue toward understanding how perfect tunneling or perfect reflection is induced .",
    "a scalar bec is presumably the simplest system in the sense that it has no internal degrees of freedom .",
    "however we note that the transverse spin wave of the spin-1 spinor bec is the simplest mode showing anomalous tunneling , rather than the bogoliubov mode in the scalar bec ; the transverse spin wave is described by a single - component schrdinger - type equation while the bogoliubov mode obeys a two - component schrdinger - type equation .    through our studies",
    ", the features of anomalous tunneling of the bogoliubov mode in a scalar bec will be clear .",
