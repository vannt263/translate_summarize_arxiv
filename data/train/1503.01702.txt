    "[ bbw ] ) @xcite , the conditions for atom collection in a mot are in stark contrast to those required to reach the lowest temperatures : a mot needs high beam intensities relative to the saturation intensity @xmath22 , detuning of a few natural linewidths @xmath23 and a magnetic gradient @xmath24g / cm for a typical alkali metal vapour cell mot with @xmath25 mm beam diameter .",

    "the standard doppler temperature minimum in the limit of low intensity and detuning @xmath32 is @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34k for rubidium , with the more general lowest temperature @xmath35 minimised at a detuning @xmath36 . throughout this paper , for consistency",

    "( [ doptemp ] ) leads to much better agreement with our experimentally measured temperatures ( sec .",
    "[ exp ] ) .    although the velocity distribution in a magneto - optical trap is gaussian , the system is by no means in thermal equilibrium in the usual sense , with the typical light scattering rate from atoms vastly larger than the interatomic elastic collision rate . the final ` temperature ' in a given direction",
    "is given by the balance between the heating ( cf .",
    "diffusion coefficient and light scattering rate ) and the velocity damping constant @xmath39 . in our system",
    "the effective temperature parallel to and perpendicular to the grating are therefore expected to be different .    for our gratings",
    "if the incident beam has a spatially uniform intensity @xmath40 and wavevector @xmath41 , for balanced optical pressure from @xmath42 diffracted orders each should ideally carry an intensity of @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the wavevectors of the diffracted beams are @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the angle the diffracted orders make to the grating normal @xmath47 ( @xmath48 cf .",
    "the total intensity is therefore @xmath49 with each beam of intensity @xmath50 contributing a relative intensity - dependent heating proportional to its intensity along the beam direction due to absorption , and an equal associated heating rate due to spontaneous emission .",
    "the heating from spontaneous emission is assumed for simplicity to be isotropic , with the heating rate for light with a wavevector @xmath51 proportional to @xmath52 in the @xmath53 and @xmath54 dimensions , for a scattering rate @xmath55 assuming dipolar ( as opposed to isotropic ) spontaneous emission from a circularly polarised atom adds complexity and does not significantly alter the predicted temperatures",
    ". the heating due to absorption is apportioned @xmath56 in the three spatial dimensions .",
    "the total heating rate near zero velocity in each dimension is thus : @xmath57 which simplifies to @xmath58    in balanced laser cooling the relative damping constants can be determined by the taylor expansion of the total force equation @xmath59 about @xmath60 the damping constants in the @xmath61 directions ( @xmath62 parallel to the grating ) and @xmath54 direction ( @xmath63 perpendicular to the grating ) are thus given by @xcite : @xmath64 is the damping force in a standard 6-beam mot . the temperature in each dimension can then be determined as proportional to the ratio of the diffusion * d * ( eq .  ( [ diff ] ) ) to the damping @xmath65 ( eq .  ( [ damp ] ) ) : @xmath66 which reduces to the standard isotropic temperature @xmath67 when @xmath68 note this temperature only depends on the grating diffraction angle and not on the number of diffracted orders @xmath69    the temperatures obtained experimentally ( sec .  [ exp ] ) do not reflect the theoretical temperature disparity in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the grating .",
    "the model above only includes forces due to absorption of light _ directly _ from the laser beams , however for mots with larger atom number and light scattering rate ( like in our experiment ) , there will be a significant contribution to the forces in the mot due to the @xmath70 repulsion from closely packed atoms with inter - particle spacing @xmath71 due to absorption of spontaneously emitted light from neighbouring atoms @xcite .",
    "these forces effectively mix the energies across dimensions , creating a more uniform temperature distribution .",
    "the theoretical temperature we use in both dimensions is therefore @xmath72 , which agrees surprisingly well with experimental values given the simplicity of the model .    for completeness and to determine theoretical mot density",
    ", one can also derive the spring constant @xmath73 of the trap , expanding the total force @xmath74 , but this time relative to position .",
    "the @xmath46 dependencies of the damping constants are @xmath75 the same as derived by vangeleyn _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "the damping therefore reduces to an isotropic @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) of the standard 6-beam mot radial ( axial ) @xmath73 values , if the gmot has @xmath78 and laser beams of the same intensity as the standard mot . under these conditions",
    "the gmot should be spatially isotropic  it will have equal rms cloud radii as a standard mot in both directions parallel to the grating , but twice the standard mot extent in the direction perpendicular to the grating .",
    "an important caution against using this doppler spring constant to determine density , however , is that the experimental spring constant of a trap is notoriously difficult to determine , and the reradiative forces @xcite discussed in the previous paragraph make simple models of the effective spring constant considerably more difficult .",
    "in order to predict the number of atoms in the mot , we use the standard method of lindquist _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite : treat the mot as a spherical target region with radius @xmath71 and cross - section @xmath79 , then find the flux of atoms incident on the target , with speeds less than the capture velocity @xmath80 of the mot slowing region . in the ideal case of a rubidium - dominated vapour both loading and loss mechanisms are proportional to atomic density , which is therefore irrelevant for calculating atom number .",
    "it is necessary to know the collisional cross section of cold atoms as seen by hot atoms , which for rubidium is @xmath81m@xmath82 @xcite ( similar to caesium @xcite ) .",
    "we make the assumption of a 1d optical molasses from two counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "the total acceleration is modified by a prefactor @xmath83 to allow for geometric effects : @xmath84 by rearranging one arrives at an equation of the form @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a quartic polynomial in @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a constant .",
    "this equation can then be integrated to analytically determine @xmath89 .",
    "the integration constant is chosen such that @xmath90 .",
    "setting @xmath91 ( atoms are stopped over a distance of twice the mot radius ) and subsequently inverting gives @xmath80 , the capture velocity .",
    "the total steady - state number of atoms in the mot is then @xcite : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a thermal velocity in the ( hot ) background vapour .",
    "we note that the saturation intensity features in the theoretical temperature and both theoretical and experimental atom number , and we therefore consistently use the saturation intensity averaged over all polarisations and magnetic sub - levels @xmath37mw/@xmath1 , which is valid for small detunings @xcite .",
    "there are , however , arguments for using a value closer to the stretched state saturation intensity @xmath38mw/@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we used this value in our previous work on atom number @xcite as a precaution to prevent over - counting the atom number , although for high levels of saturation the effect of changing @xmath94 on experimental atom number is negligible .",
    "in the theory so far we have assumed a spatially uniform incident laser intensity . however , real propagating laser beams tend to have gaussian spatial intensity profiles . if such intensity distributions are apertured , or their intensity is spatially modified in other respects , as long as the modifications occur on large ( centimetre size ) beams , diffraction effects can be neglected . while various refractive beam shapers which transform gaussian beams into flat - top intensity beams are available on the market ,",
    "these tend to be expensive ( albeit power efficient ) and designed for relatively small output beam diameters .",
    "spatially shaping a gaussian beam with radial profile @xmath95 using an apodizing filter of outer radius @xmath96 with a neutral density @xmath97 leads to a uniform beam intensity , with reduced intensity @xmath98 across the beam .",
    "the relative power in the beam is then @xmath99 which has a maximum of @xmath100 when the aperture radius is @xmath101  i.e. even under optimal conditions it is a fairly lossy solution .    , shown both as vector streamlines and magnitude .",
    "the white arrow indicates the centre and direction of the beam incident on the grating ( gold line at figure base ) , whereas the white cross indicates the quadrupole magnetic field centre . in figure",

[ figimbal ] ) .",
    "we assume similar parameters to the mot experiment  a gaussian input trap beam with intensity @xmath105mw/@xmath1 and detuning @xmath106 apertured to a @xmath107 mm radius and a magnetic quadrupole with axial gradient @xmath108g / cm . in situations where the beam intensity is spatially uniform ( fig .",
    "[ figimbal](a ) ) the radiation pressure balance is uniform throughout the beam - overlap volume .",
    "however , with a gaussian beam intensity profile ( fig .",
    "[ figimbal](b ) ) , the diffracted orders at the mot location originate from lower and lower intensity regions of the gaussian beam as the mot position is raised from the grating surface .",
    "this means that the mot is pushed downwards more , relative to the magnetic quadrupole centre , as the mot is raised above the grating surface .",
    "moreover , there is a marked change in the relative trapping and damping constants : @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ figimbal](a ) and @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ figimbal](b ) ( compared to the isotropic values of @xmath111 for @xmath112 and uniform intensity ) .",
    "the case of uniform intensity is preferable , as long as one has optimal diffraction efficiency in the gratings , as then the mot and molasses properties do not depend on mot position .",
    "however , if one uses gaussian beams and the diffraction efficiency is too high , one can compensate by raising the mot position to a location where optical forces are balanced and suitable for sub - doppler cooling . in sections  [ exp ] and [ bbw ] with chip cir@xmath113",
    "we show how locally shaping the input beam intensity can dramatically improve both mot and molasses performance .",
    "the experimental conditions were very similar to those detailed in the methods section of nshii _ et al .",

    "note that the theoretical atom number saturates at about three times lower intensity than that observed experimentally  we seem to need three times more laser power experimentally than we would theoretically expect .",

    "[ figcir](f ) cir ) there was an even larger discrepancy with theory ( very high experimental temperatures ) due to imbalanced optical force during the fluorescence imaging .",

    "for many metrological experiments , such as atomic clock measurements , the precision achieved strongly depends upon the temperature and total population of the atomic ensemble .",
    "hence , an understanding of the final number of atoms that can be brought from the mot stage to ultracold temperatures provides a good indication of the full capability of the gmot . in nshii _",
    "@xcite we effectively had only binary control of the intensity  this meant we could _ either _ get a large number of atoms on chip cir with high intensity , or good optical molasses on chip tri@xmath12 with lower intensity light ( and a correspondingly small number of atoms loaded in the mot ) .",
    "after analysis of the results presented in section [ exp ] , the most suitable gratings for mot number and temperature are chip cir@xmath113 and tri@xmath13 . to study the number of atoms that could be brought to sub - doppler temperatures , a mot of intensity @xmath126mw/@xmath1 and detuning of @xmath127 ( initial mot indicated by black dots in experimental figs .",

    "in doppler theory the cloud size scales as @xmath146 however we note from the relatively constant experimental mot density for a variety of detunings and intensities that we are reaching sufficient atom numbers to likely be entering the mot ` constant density regime ' where reradiation forces become more important than restoring forces @xcite .    in terms of the temperature ,",
    "significant sub - doppler effects are not present , however we note that one would only expect sub - doppler cooling under conditions of low intensity and large negative detunings , where we have insufficient data coverage to draw any further conclusions .",
