    "heavy - to - light decay processes become more and more important nowadays with copious data from the @xmath0 factories .",
    "especially , @xmath1 decays provide information about the poorly known cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) element @xmath2 . in a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "heavy - to - light transition shows interesting kinematical configurations which provoke new effective theories of strong interaction .",
    "soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) is a useful framework to deal with light and energetic particles @xcite .",
    "but nonperturbative quantities are always involved in the analysis .",
    "the way how to deal with them is crucial and distinctively differs in various approaches . among the nonperturbative calculational methods , light - cone sum rule ( lcsr )",
    "has been very successful @xcite .",
    "compared to the traditional sum rule by shifman , vainshtein , and zakharov ( svz ) @xcite , lcsr is more adequate for the heavy - to - light decays @xcite . in the svz sum rules ,",
    "nonperturbative effects are encoded by the so called vacuum condensates .",
    "but it is argued that the condensates exaggerate the end - point behavior of the final state meson distribution amplitudes ( da ) in the heavy - to - light decays @xcite .",
    "the lcsr is based on an expansion of nonlocal operators in twist whose matrix elements between vacuum and the meson define the meson distribution amplitudes .",
    "one of the most representative nonperturbative quantity for the heavy - to - light transition is the @xmath3 form factor , @xmath4 .",
    "it was already calculated by lcsr in @xcite .",
    "a new development of qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite enlarged our understanding of various @xmath0 decays , and the spectator interactions are systematically examined in @xcite .",
    "the advent of scet enabled us to analyze @xmath4 more profoundly @xcite .    what makes the analysis more complicated is the possible existence of the feynman mechanism , or soft overlap .",
    "in this situation , some of the partons carry very small momentum compared to others to make the final state meson .",
    "it is quite controversial how large the soft overlap is , or even how to _ define _ this soft contribution @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath5 in @xcite includes only collinear quarks for the final pion , implicitly neglecting the soft - overlap configuration .",
    "that is the reason why the @xmath5 is power - counted from @xmath6 , where @xmath7 @xmath8 is a large ( hadronic ) scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the  soft form factor  @xmath9 in @xcite includes a hard - collinear spectator interactions as its @xmath6 corrections which are not momentum asymmetric . and",
    "the authors of @xcite define the ",
    "universal form factor  @xmath10 in terms of soft - collinear messenger modes to describe the soft overlap . a clearer and more definite construction will be needed to remove any confusions .",
    "we will use the terminology of  spin - symmetric  and  spin - nonsymmetric  contributions to the form factors @xcite .",
    "recently , there was a try to establish the lcsr in scet to calculate the heavy - to - light form factors @xcite .",
    "actually , there have been many efforts to construct the lcsr in the effective theory , like hqet @xcite . in a conventional method ,",
    "one constructs the correlation function typically with the interpolating current for the initial state and the weak current .",
    "after possible contractions , the remaining fields between the vacuum and the final state define the distribution amplitudes .",
    "the authors of @xcite claim that when the momentum configuration of the final partons is highly asymmetric , then the light - cone expansion of the remaining fields is not guaranteed .",
    "they propose an alternative method where the final state pion is described by the interpolating fields .",
    "but as we will see later , new method for lcsr does not show a fundamental difference from the conventional one .",
    "rather , the two methods are _ equivalent _ under proper conditions .    in this paper ,",
    "a natural extension of the conventional lcsr in the effective theory is pursued .",
    "in other words , we describe the initial @xmath0 meson in terms of the usual interpolating fields .",
    "we reproduce the previous results for the form factors of lcsr . + as for the soft form factors , they will be still suffering from the criticism from @xcite .",
    "but we argue that the defects are not fully overcome by a new method also .",
    "still the essential point is how to combine the momentum - asymmetric partons into the final state pion . in spite of this difficulty",
    ", we would like to show that lcsr in scet can be well established , especially when the collinear gluon is exchanged with the spectator quark , hoping a deeper understanding about scet , much like the traditional svz sum rule in the hqet .",

    "<S> leading order spin - symmetric contribution corresponds to the  soft overlap  where some of the partons carry very small momentum . </S>",
