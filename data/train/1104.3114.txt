    "the milky way s thick disk , first identified from fits of the vertical density profile of stars with a mix of exponential functions ( yoshii 1982 ; gilmore & reid 1983 ) , differs in many ways from the thin disk , e.g. , in its kinematics and chemical abundances .",
    "the scale height of the thick disk is about 1 kpc , while that of the thin disk is @xmath7 kpc .",
    "typical thick - disk stars have generally lower net orbital rotational velocities with larger velocity dispersions ( majewski 1993 ; chiba & beers 2000 ; robin et al . 2003 ; soubiran et al . 2003 ; parker et al .",
    "2004 ; wyse et al . 2006 ) , possess higher [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios , and are older and more metal - poor than typical thin - disk stars ( bensby et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ; reddy et al . 2006 , 2010",
    "; fuhrmann 2008 ; haywood 2008 ) .",
    "their higher [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios and older ages imply that thick - disk stars were born earlier than most thin - disk stars , in an environment of rapid star formation , and that they have likely had more time to experience dynamical heating and secular processes such as scattering by perturbations in the disk . as a result of the multiple complex processes that thick - disk stars may have experienced during their lifetimes , consensus on the nature of the formation and evolution of the thick disk",
    "has yet to be reached .",
    "the currently discussed mechanisms for thick - disk formation can be broadly divided into two groups  violent origin and secular evolution . among the models involving violent origin , the heating scenario ( e.g. , quinn et al . 1993 ; kazantzidis et al . 2008 ) posits that the thick disk results from a pre - existing thin disk that has been dynamically heated by satellite mergers . in their simulations of this process",
    ", villalobos & helmi ( 2008 ) found that on the order of 1020% of the stars in the thickened disk component were accreted from satellites , the rest being heated thin - disk stars .",
    "the accretion origin of the thick disk ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) invokes the hypothesis that thick - disk stars were predominantly formed in dwarf - like galaxies , which were then directly assimilated into the thick disk from orbits that reached near the galactic disk plane .",
    "abadi et al . ( 2003 ) predicted that over 70% of thick - disk stars were accreted from such disrupted galaxies .",
    "the third model among the violent origin class is that thick - disk stars may have formed @xmath8 through chaotic mergers of gas - rich systems , prompting simultaneous early star formation before and during the mergers ( brook et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 , 2007 ) , and that thin - disk stars formed after the merger events settled down .",
    "secular evolution by disk heating was first conceived by spitzer & schwarzschild ( 1953 ) , who demonstrated that encounters with molecular clouds could increase the velocity dispersion of late type , old stars .",
    "barbanis & woltjer ( 1967 ) also showed that spiral structures might be the cause of the larger velocity dispersion of older stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these ideas had been further developed by several studies ( e.g. , fuchs 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "although challenged by jenkins ( 1992 ) , disk heating by secular processes have recently regained attention , both observationally and theoretically , as possible thick - disk formation scenarios .",
    "indeed , recent theoretical studies and simulations ( schnrich & binney 2009a , 2009b ; loebman et al . 2010 ) suggested that the thick disk might not require a violent origin , but rather could have formed by cumulative secular processes associated with the radial migration of stars . according to the migration theories ( sellwood & binney 2002 ; rokar et al .",
    "2008a ) , stars in the galactic disk can radially move from the inner ( outer ) to the outer ( inner ) regions due to resonant scattering by transient spiral structure . based on their simulations ,",
    "minchev & famaey ( 2010 ) also suggested that long - lived spiral structures , interacting with a central bar , could be responsible for the radial movements of stars in a disk galaxy .",
    "these proposed models predict various trends between the kinematic parameters and chemical abundances of disk - system stars , as well as between their kinematics and spatial distributions .",
    "for example , schnrich & binney ( 2008b ) suggested that local , relatively metal - rich thin - disk stars , formed in the inner part of the disk and moved outward , while local metal - poor thin - disk stars were born in the outer disk and migrated inward to the solar radius , retaining information on the kinematic differences between the two populations .",
    "thus , there should exist a gradient in the variation of rotational velocity with metallicity ; evidence for such a behavior has been claimed observationally by haywood ( 2008 ) .",
    "models of disk heating via satellite mergers ( villalobos et al . 2010 ) result in proposed relationships between rotational velocity and galactocentric distance and distance from the galactic plane .",
    "gas - rich merger models ( brook et al . 2007 ) also predict a gradient of rotational velocity with galactocentric radius for disk stars near the solar radius .",
    "sales et al .",
    "( 2009 ) proposed that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for nearby thick - disk stars could be used to provide constraints on the various suggested formation models .",
    "a number of recent papers also have employed this framework to study possible origins of the thick disk , based on data from several large spectroscopic surveys .",
    "for example , wilson et al . (",
    "2011 ) have explored data from the radial velocity experiment ( rave ; steinmetz et al .",
    "2006 ) , while dierickx et al .",
    "( 2010 ) used data from the seventh public release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr7 ; york et al .",
    "2000 ; abazajian et al .",
    "the study of casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) combined rave data with newly available proper motions from the fourth release of the southern proper motion catalog ( spm4 ; girard et al .",
    "we discuss their analyses and conclusions further below .",
    "most previous observational studies that have sought to test the various correlations predicted by the models mentioned above have used methods of assigning individual stars to membership in the thin- and thick - disk populations ( based on a given star s location or kinematics ) that introduce manifest biases that can confound interpretations ( as previously noted by schnrich & binney 2009b and loebman et al .",
    "as the chemical signatures of a star are substantially less variable properties than its spatial position or velocities over its lifetime , it is instead desirable to classify disk stars into their likely components according to their chemistry .    among the various chemical abundance ratios that might be explored for this purpose , the [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios appear particularly useful .",
    "these ratios can be relatively easily measured ( as described below ) , and have been proven to well separate thick - disk stars from thin - disk stars .",
    "it is known that , at least in the solar neighborhood ( where essentially all previous studies have been conducted ) , thick - disk stars are on average enhanced in their [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios by @xmath9 to @xmath10 dex relative to their thin - disk counterparts at a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "local kinematically selected thin- and thick - disk samples based on probabilistic membership assignments have confirmed this enhancement of [ @xmath0/fe ]  ( e.g. , bensby et al .",
    "2003 ; reddy et al .",
    "fuhrmann ( 1998 , 2008 ) also demonstrated that dwarfs in his volume - limited sample could be clearly separated into two populations as a function of [ fe / h ] ",
    "one associated with high [ mg / fe ] and the other with low [ mg / fe ] .",
    "the elemental abundance patterns of the stars with low [ mg / fe ] ratios and high [ mg / fe ] ratios are very similar to the kinematically selected thin- and thick - disk samples .",
    "the recent study by nissen & schuster ( 2010 ) demonstrated that nearby dwarfs with halo kinematics could be separated into two groups on [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "they proposed that the high-@xmath0  stars may have been born in the disk or bulge of the milky way and heated to halo kinematics by merging satellite galaxies or else were simply members of the early generations of halo stars born during the collapse of a proto - galactic gas cloud , while the low-@xmath0  stars may have been accreted from dwarf galaxies .",
    "clearly , [ @xmath0/fe ]   ratios also provide valuable information on the timescales and intensities of star formation in the populations involved .    in this study we make use of the first set of [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios obtained for a large sample of low - resolution ( @xmath1 ) spectra from the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ;",

    "this enables a @xmath13 of the disk system into likely thin- and thick - disk populations . in this paper",
    "we explore the observed correlations of rotational velocity and orbital eccentricity with metallicity , galactocentric distance and distance from the galactic plane , as well as the orbital eccentricity distributions for the individual populations , and compare with the predictions of the radial migration , gas - rich merger , accretion , and dynamical heating models .",
    "since we believe that direct quantitative comparisons with the predictions made by various models ( or simulations ) mentioned in this study are somewhat premature , we emphasize the more qualitative aspects of these comparisons .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the g - dwarf sample from segue , describe various cuts imposed on the sample to obtain a refined disk dwarf sample , and discuss the calculations used to derive their space motions and orbital eccentricities .",
    "section 3 describes how we assign membership of the stars into either the thin- or thick - disk populations .",

    "follow in section 6 .",

    ", this dataset is expected to be relatively unbiased with respect to chemistry , and completely unbiased with respect to kinematics . in order to obtain a subsample of disk stars with the most reliably estimated physical quantities we apply several additional cuts .    first , we exclude stars lacking information on their stellar parameters ( effective temperature , @xmath12 , surface gravity , @xmath18 , and metallicity , [ fe / h ] ) , radial velocities , or proper motions .",
    "the stellar atmospheric parameters were determined by the most recent version of the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; lee et al .",
    "2008a , 2008b ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2008 ; smolinski et al .",

    "it has been shown that shifts in the sspp - derived estimates of [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ]  caused by the presence of unrecognized spectroscopic binaries are generally small ( schlesinger et al . 2010 ) .",
    "although the typical uncertainty of the radial velocity varies with the s / n ratio of a spectrum , it is less than 5 km s@xmath3  for the great majority of stars in our sample .",

    "we adopt an sspp - derived [ fe / h ] in the distance estimation for each star , and fix a stellar age and [ @xmath0/fe ]  of the model at a given [ fe / h ] , assuming a linear relationship between [ fe / h ] and these quantities ( see an et al .",
    "distance estimates obtain using [ @xmath0/fe ]  from this assumption may not be internally consistent with analyses based on the sspp - determined [ @xmath0/fe ] , but even a @xmath150.1 dex difference in [ @xmath0/fe ]  has a negligible impact on the derived distances ( @xmath150.01 mag in distance modulus ) .",
    "we also limit models in the fitting to @xmath18  @xmath24 to minimize possible distance bias from stellar age effects near the main - sequence turn - off .",
    "an inter - comparison of results from the three cmds suggests that the internal error in the distance modulus is @xmath150.1 mag ; an additional @xmath150.1 mag error is expected from the combined errors in age , [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath0/fe ] , and @xmath25 .",

    "slightly higher s / n was required to achieve this precision ( s / n @xmath34 @xmath3 ) .    in order to assemble a local dwarf sample ,",
    "we only include stars with distances , @xmath35 , less than 3 kpc from the sun , and with @xmath18  @xmath24 .",
    "these cuts ensure that we are selecting likely dwarfs from which we can obtain accurate space motions ( i.e. , that do not suffer from severe degradation due to propagation of proper motion errors at larger distances ) . in order to perform a confident separation of the thin- and thick - disk populations on the basis of [ @xmath0/fe ]",
    ", we further require that the spectra of the dwarf stars included in our analysis have s / n @xmath36 @xmath3 .",

    ", we then derive the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 space velocity components .",
    "we apply @xmath40 = ( @xmath41 ) km s@xmath3  ( schnrich et al . 2010 ) to adjust for the solar peculiar motions with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . for the purpose of our analysis",
    ", we also make use of the rotational velocity around the galactic center in a cylindrical coordinate system , @xmath42 , calculated assuming @xmath43  = 8.0 kpc and @xmath44 = 220 km s@xmath3 . the galactocentric distance projected onto the galactic plane , @xmath45 , and the vertical distance from the galactic plane , @xmath46 ,",
    "are also obtained . in addition , by adoption of an analytic stckel - type gravitational potential ( which includes a flattened , oblate disk and a spherically - shaped massive dark halo ; see chiba & beers 2000 ) , we compute @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , the maximum ( minimum ) distance from the galactic center that a star reaches during its orbit , as well as the orbital eccentricity , @xmath49 , defined as ( @xmath50@xmath48 ) /(@xmath51 ) . errors in the derived kinematics and orbital parameters for each star due to propagation of the errors in the observed quantities ( mostly dominated by distance and proper motion errors ) are determined by 1000 realizations of a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we next remove stars from our sample with derived rotational velocities relative to the galactic center less than @xmath42  = @xmath450 km s@xmath3 , with [ fe / h ] @xmath521.2 , and located outside the range @xmath53 kpc , in order to minimize contamination from the halo and outer - disk components .",
    "finally , we perform a simple check on the likely remaining halo contamination in our sample following the prescription of bensby et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for calculation of the approximate disk and halo star fractions ( assuming our data is representative of the local solar neighborhood densities ) , we adopt the local stellar densities , velocity dispersions in @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , and the asymmetric drifts listed in their table 1 , assuming the space velocities of the thin - disk , thick - disk , and halo stars are distributed as gaussians . based on these probability distributions",
    ", we reject stars that have greater likelihood of belonging to the halo than to the disk system .",
    "this check removes only about 59 additional stars from the sample , showing that the above selection criteria for thin- and thick - disk stars are quite reasonable .",
    "we also experimented with the application of slightly different scale heights for describing the variation of halo stellar densities with @xmath46 , but the above result appears quite robust .",
    "note , however , that these various cuts do not necessarily eliminate contamination by members of the so - called metal - weak thick - disk ( mwtd ) population , which carollo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown exhibits metallicities in the range @xmath21.7 @xmath54 [ fe / h ] @xmath55 , and a prograde rotation of @xmath42  @xmath15 @xmath56 to @xmath57 km s@xmath3 .",

    "@xmath59 km s@xmath3 , [ fe / h ] @xmath60 , @xmath53 kpc , and possess greater probability of belonging to the disk system than to the halo .",
    "the surviving sample from the above cuts numbers @xmath1517,300 stars .",
    "figure [ fig : sample ] shows the distributions of [ fe / h ] , @xmath42 , @xmath46 , and @xmath45 for the final dwarf sample ( solid lines ) , before and after further division based on the derived [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios into the thin- and thick - disk populations , as described below .",
    "note that in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : sample ] has only a small number of stars with @xmath61 kpc , owing to the bright limit of sdss imaging ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "thus , our analysis in the following sections may be only valid for the thin - disk population with @xmath63 kpc , rather than the young(er ) thin disk closer to the plane .",
    "as mentioned previously , since a stellar population s kinematics and spatial distributions can be modified over time ( especially in the disk system ) , while a ( dwarf ) star s atmospheric chemical abundance is essentially invariant ( except in unusual circumstances , such as binary mass transfer from an evolved companion ) , we make use of the estimated [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratio as a reference to separate the thin- and thick - disk populations .",
    "this choice is also strongly motivated by the apparent bi - modal distribution of stars in the [ @xmath0/fe ]  and [ fe / h ]  plane seen in figure [ fig : contour ] .",
    "for the purpose of the present analysis , our dwarf sample is split into likely thin - disk ( with low [ @xmath0/fe ] ) and thick - disk ( with high [ @xmath0/fe ] ) populations , based on the following scheme : + i ) for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath64    * thin disk , if [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath65[fe / h ] @xmath66 * thick disk , if [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath67[fe / h ] @xmath68    \\ii ) for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath69    * thin disk , if [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath70 * thick disk , if [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath71    this division into the thin- and thick - disk populations is devised based on examination of the distribution of number densities in the [ @xmath0/fe ]  vs. [ fe / h ]  plane , shown in figure [ fig : contour ] .",
    "note how well the populations appear to separate above and below the solid line in this figure , which is our adopted fiducial .",
    "the dashed lines located @xmath720.05 dex in [ @xmath0/fe ]  above and below the fiducial solid line in figure [ fig : contour ] indicate the dividing points for the high-[@xmath0/fe ]  ( thick - disk ) and low-[@xmath0/fe ]  ( thin - disk ) stars .",
    "note that this leaves a gap of 0.1 dex in [ @xmath0/fe ]  between the thin- and thick - disk dividing lines .",
    "this choice serves to reduce the number of misclassified stars that may arise from observational errors in their measured [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "the dashed red line in figure [ fig : sample ] shows the thin - disk subsample , whereas the dotted - dash blue line is for the thick - disk subsample , classified by the dividing schemes described above . from this figure",
    ", one can roughly read off the ranges and peak values of the estimated and derived parameters for each subsample .",
    "to check on the efficacy of the chemical separation of the disk populations through use of the [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratio , we have investigated the variation of the @xmath73 velocity dispersions of our sample with [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "it is well known that the dispersion of each velocity component increases with distance from the galactic plane ( as well as on age , on average ) . in any event ,",
    "the thick - disk population exhibits substantially higher dispersions than the thin - disk counterpart .",
    "figure [ fig : veldisp ] shows the derived velocity dispersions of our sample as a function of [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "it is readily apparent that , up to around [ @xmath0/fe ]  = @xmath9 , the dispersion of each velocity component increases moderately . above [ @xmath0/fe ]",
    "= @xmath9 the gradients of the velocity dispersions with [ @xmath0/fe ]  become somewhat steeper . above [ @xmath0/fe ]",
    "= @xmath10 , the magnitude of each velocity dispersion is larger by about 10 km s@xmath3  than for [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath74 . as our thin - disk stars mostly have [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath74 and thick - disk stars possess [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath75 , figure [ fig : veldisp ] kinematically confirms that the division by [ @xmath0/fe ]  into the thin- and thick - disk populations is quite robust .",
    "one may be concerned about biases in our initial sample which might arise from our @xmath76 target selection due to small , but non - zero , metallicity sensitivity of the stellar colors .",
    "haywood ( 2001 ) , for example , has previously suggested that targeting stars on the basis of their spectral types ( e.g. , g - dwarfs ) preferentially selected more metal - poor than metal - rich stars , resulting in a metallicity distribution shifted lower by about 0.10.3 dex .",
    "if our selected sample strongly favors metal - poor over metal - rich stars , this bias might produce misleading correlations between the parameters we are seeking to understand .",
    "for example , at least for the thick - disk population , previous studies have indicated that the observed stellar orbital rotational velocity decreases with declining metallicity .",
    "thus , if biases have increased the relative numbers of metal - poor stars in the thick - disk subsample , the overall distribution of @xmath42  will be shifted to lower rotational velocity .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that , because our sample does not suffer from kinematic bias , any correlations that we are seeking between kinematics and chemical abundances will not be affected by any potential metallicity bias , as long as the correlations are derived from ranges of @xmath45 and @xmath46  that are sufficiently small that the correlations remain roughly constant over the regions considered .",
    "furthermore , any kinematic trends with @xmath45 and @xmath46  will not be affected by metallicity bias , as long as the metallicity distributions of stars in different ranges of the spatial cuts do not vary significantly .",
    "hence , instead of correcting for possible selection bias in our sample ( which itself is a complex and tricky business ) , we instead seek to demonstrate that any presumed metallicity bias does not greatly impact the kinematic correlations with spatial parameters that we derive by examination of the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) for both the thin- and thick - disk subsamples in various regions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 . if there is any sudden change in the mdfs of each subsample between neighboring regions , that will be a sign that the subsample may not be suitable for deriving meaningful correlations between kinematics and distance .",
    "for the thick disk , there is some existing evidence for the lack of a metallicity gradient with distance above the galactic plane ( e.g. , gilmore et al .",
    "1995 ) , or at most for only a small one , on the order of 0.10.2 dex kpc@xmath3 ( ivezi et al .",
    "so , the shape of the observed mdfs at different heights should remain roughly constant .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : bias ] displays the observed mdfs for both the thin- and thick - disk subsamples in different bins of @xmath46  distance . from inspection ,",
    "the relative numbers of metal - rich stars in the thick - disk subsample do not grossly change with different cuts on height above the plane , so false kinematic trends with @xmath46 are not expected to arise .",
    "quantitatively , the fraction of the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath77 for the thick - disk subsample is 0.51 , 0.51 , 0.58 , and 0.64 from the first to the fourth panel ( a resulting metallicity gradient with @xmath46  of @xmath78 dex kpc@xmath3 ) , consistent with the expectation from previous work .",
    "these results are also in line with the findings of haywood ( 2001 ) , who noted that the metallicity bias arising from the color selection was significant for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath79 , but not for relatively metal - poor thick - disk stars .",
    "however , this seems not to be the case for the thin - disk subsample shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : bias ] . at heights above @xmath46  = 1.5",
    "kpc ( already many thin - disk scale heights above the plane ) , we notice that more metal - rich stars have dropped out of the distribution , compared to the upper three panels .",
    "this is quantitatively confirmed by examination of the fraction of stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath80 ( 0.45 , 0.46 , 0.58 , and 0.71 from the first to the fourth panel ) .",
    "this may be a natural consequence of selecting the sample without consideration of the @xmath46  distance , since at greater heights thick - disk stars are expected to dominate .",
    "in other words , some of the stars in the metal - poor tail of the thin - disk subsample may in reality belong to the thick disk , but they have been misclassified as thin - disk stars due to errors in the estimated [ @xmath0/fe ] . indeed , considering the distribution of [ @xmath0/fe ]  for the stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath81 and @xmath46@xmath82 in the thin - disk subsample , many of the stars have [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath83 .",
    "thus , moderately @xmath0-enhanced stars at this height may mostly belong to the thick disk rather than to the thin disk , with a much lower probability of old thin - disk membership .",
    "simple experiments support the above argument . according to lee et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the error in [ @xmath0/fe ]  at s / n = 30 @xmath3 is about 0.08 dex .",
    "if we assume this is a reasonable estimate of a 1@xmath84 random error in [ @xmath0/fe ]  for all stars with @xmath46  @xmath82 kpc , and simultaneously perturb the measured [ @xmath0/fe ]  and [ fe / h ]  values according to a normal distribution with @xmath85 dex and the measured uncertainty in [ fe / h ] , the total number of stars classified as members of the thin - disk component falls to about 85 , after averaging the results of 1000 different realizations .",
    "this is substantially smaller than the 201 stars that are claimed to be present .",
    "thus , it is valid ( within statistical fluctuations ) to say that the low-[@xmath0/fe ]  metal - poor thin - disk stars in this @xmath46  distance region are likely spurious , and are found at roughly the expected level of contamination .",
    "moreover , as the total number of thin - disk stars in this most distant region is rather small , we expect the impact of such stars on our analysis to be minimal .    concerning the variation of the mdfs for cuts in the @xmath45 distance , many previous studies ( e.g. , nordstrm et al .",
    "2004 ; holmberg et al .",
    "2007 ; andrievsky et al . 2004",

    "2009 ) that used open clusters and/or field stars to derive radial metallicity gradients report rather small gradients , on the order of @xmath86 to @xmath87 dex  kpc@xmath3 .",
    "thus , we expect the mdfs in our sample to appear similar in different bins of radial distance from the galactic center .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : bias ] shows the mdfs of the thin- and thick - disk subsamples for several slices in @xmath45 . from inspection ,",
    "the overall shapes of the mdfs remain the same through the fourth panel , although there is a small drop in the numbers of thin - disk stars around [ fe / h ] @xmath88 in the distance range @xmath89 kpc . calculating the fraction of the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath77 for the thick - disk subsample , we obtain 0.56 , 0.54 , 0.58 , and 0.61 from the first to the fourth panel , a resulting radial metallicity gradient of @xmath90 dex  kpc@xmath3 .",
    "for the thin - disk subsample , the fraction of the stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath80 is 0.42 , 0.47 , 0.48 , and 0.57 from the first to the fourth panel .",
    "the derived radial metallicity gradient is @xmath91 dex  kpc@xmath3 ; these slopes do not differ significantly from the previous studies .",
    "thus , the results of these two exercises suggest that it is highly unlikely that any potential metallicity bias in our sample can greatly affect our derived kinematic correlations with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    potential biases also might depend on the age distribution of our sample , which is not known at present , and in any case is difficult to quantify . as the narrow color range applied to originally select the g - dwarfs for spectroscopic follow - up in segue",
    "also preferentially selects certain age ranges on the main sequence , we might expect that this bias might contribute at some level to the observed trends ( e.g. , rotational velocity versus metallicity ) that we are seeking to understand .",
    "however , as noted by haywood ( 2001 ) , age bias is expected to be even less important than the metallicity bias that we have already shown to have minimal effect .",
    "in this section we use our local g - dwarf sample to examine the observed gradients of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , as well as trends of @xmath49 with [ fe / h ] , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  for the thin - disk and thick - disk populations as identified above .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : fehalp ] shows a color - coded distribution of @xmath42  in the [ @xmath0/fe ]  vs. [ fe / h ]  plane for our g - dwarf sample .",
    "detailed examination of this panel ( as well as figure [ fig : contour ] ) reveals a metal - poor tail for the low-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars ( @xmath74 ) , which we associate with the thin disk , extending down to [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.7 .",
    "this already implies that the thin disk may not be well - described by a single metal - rich population with a peak around [ fe / h ] = @xmath20.2 .",
    "we also notice from this panel that a higher rotational velocity is observed in the region of the metal - poor thin disk ( [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath74 and [ fe / h ] @xmath920.3 ) , suggesting a negative trend of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] .",
    "in contrast , the high-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars ( @xmath75 , which we associate with the thick disk ) apparently exhibit a strong positive trend of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] .",

    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fehalp ] displays the distribution of mean orbital radii ( @xmath93 ) in the [ @xmath0/fe ]  vs. [ fe / h ]  plane .",
    "it is clear that the stars we associate with the thick - disk population exhibit smaller mean orbital radii than those with associated with the thin disk .",
    "in addition , the metal - poor thin - disk stars possess larger mean orbital radii than the dominant metal - rich thin - disk stars .",
    "looking at the results from other observational work , a recent study by navarro et al .",

    "these authors found little or no correlation between @xmath42  and [ fe / h ] for their thin - disk stars ( defined by [ fe / h ] @xmath940.7 and [ @xmath0/fe ]  @xmath74 ) , although the subset of their thin - disk subsample with available eu abundances ( so that potential thick - disk or halo stars could be rejected ) exhibits a very similar pattern to that we identify here .",
    "one should also keep in mind the possibility of effects from selection biases in their sample , as it was based on an assembly of stars that included kinematically selected targets .",
    "haywood ( 2008 ) separated thin - disk stars with [ mg / fe ] @xmath74 from thick - disk stars with [ mg / fe ] @xmath95 in the spectroscopic sample of soubiran @xmath96 girard ( 2005 ) , and found an increasing trend of the mean orbital radii with decreasing metallicity for the thin - disk population , along with a decreasing trend of mean radii with decreasing metallicity for the thick - disk population ( see his figure 3 ) .",
    "he claimed that this tendency resulted from stars that migrated from the inner and outer disk .",
    "these behaviors are qualitatively in very good agreement with our findings in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fehalp ] .",
    "rocha - pinto et al .",

    "their primary results were that , as the difference in the distance between the mean orbital radius and the solar radius increases , the abundances of fe , na , si , ca , ni , and ba all decrease .",
    "this relationship between the chemical abundances and the mean orbital radii could be accounted for by radial displacements of the stars involved .",
    "it is quite remarkable that all of the observed behaviors of the mean orbital radii from our g - dwarf sample agree so well with several previous observational studies ( based on much smaller samples ) .",

    "figure [ fig : fehvphizd ] displays the observed gradients at different heights above the plane for both subsamples .",
    "similar slopes of @xmath42  for both the low- and high-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars are obtained for the various slices in @xmath46  distance , although the slope of the thick - disk subsample becomes shallower at larger distance ( fourth panel ) , and slightly steeper for the thin - disk subsample ( which only includes 201 stars ) .",
    "the slopes are obtained by performing least - squares fits to the _ unbinned _ samples of each population ; the uncertainties in the slopes are calculated by resampling each population with replacement 1000 times . in that process , the [ fe / h ] and @xmath42  values are perturbed simultaneously by draws from a normal distribution using the 1@xmath84 errors in each quantity .",
    "the data shown in the kinematic correlation plots are binned only for clarity .",
    "if significant contamination of our thick - disk subsample by unrecognized mwtd stars were present , we might expect the slope of the correlation of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] to _ increase _ with distance above the plane , due to the greater velocity lag , larger scale height , and lower metallities of the mwtd component compared with that of the canonical thick disk ( carollo et al .",
    "that is , at larger distances from the plane and at lower [ fe / h ] , the mean @xmath42  would be expected to be _ lower _ than it would be for a pristine thick - disk sample .",

    "note that even if we include in the analysis the stars with @xmath105 @xmath42  @xmath54 50 km s@xmath3  that were eliminated in our original selection , we obtain very similar asymmetric drifts and gradients as for the case of a sample of stars that does not include them .",
    "the slopes and their uncertainties are obtained by the same way as for the gradient of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] .",

    "a simple monte carlo experiment with 1000 realizations of the subsamples also reveals that the derived trends of the eccentricities with [ fe / h ] , @xmath45 , and @xmath46  above are not strongly affected by errors in the parameters involved , as the computed gradients of the eccentricities are within 3@xmath84 from those values listed in table [ tab : obs ] , which quantitatively summarizes various correlations discussed in this section for the two subsamples .",

    "it may be unwise to rely too strongly on the present predictions of the suggested thick - disk formation models .",
    "this follows because , even though they are able to reproduce some aspects of the milky way s disk system , the predicted properties are limited by large uncertainties with their treatment of star formation , the dynamical interaction of presumed satellites with the disk , unavoidable numerical effects , and the myriad set of assumptions that are required in their construction .",
    "thus , in this section , we compare our observational findings only with qualitative expectations from the published radial migration , gas - rich merger , accretion , and disk heating models .",
    "it is our expectation that , as the models and simulations improve , these comparisons will increasingly be able to discriminate between the relative importance of the various formation scenarios .",
    "according to the radial migration models ( sellwood & binney 2002 ; rokar et al .",
    "2008a ; schnrich & binney 2009a ; minchev & famaey 2010 ) , the ( presumably ) metal - poor stars of the thin disk ( which includes young , low-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars ) that were born in the outer disk move inward to the solar neighborhood , while the ( presumably ) metal - rich stars that formed in the inner disk migrate outward into the solar neighborhood ( as the inner region of the disk has a higher stellar and gas density , and is rapidly chemically enriched , most of the stars should be metal rich ) .",
    "schnrich & binney ( 2009a ) suggested that this radial movement can occur by two mechanisms : `` blurring '' and `` churning '' . blurring refers to the increase of eccentricities over time at a similar angular momentum due to scattering , e.g. , on giant molecular clouds .",
    "churning is mostly triggered by resonant scattering at co - rotation due to transient spiral density waves , which transfers stars from inner ( or outer ) disk regions into the solar vicinity by changing their angular momenta without alteration of their orbital circularity ( hence eccentricities ) .",
    "these authors suggested that churning is the dominant process by which stars in the inner disk migrate out to the solar annulus , thus providing greater heterogeneity in the abundance and velocity distributions among solar neighborhood stars .",
    "the consequence of incomplete mixing from blurring and churning is that the metal - rich stars in the thin disk possess relatively lower rotational velocities ( @xmath42 ) , while the metal - poor stars have higher @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the expectation is that there should exist a trend of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] among ( at least ) the thin - disk stars .",
    "schnrich & binney ( 2009a , b ) indeed predicted a significant downtrend of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ]  for the low [ @xmath0/fe ]  stars , due to incomplete mixing for younger stars .",
    "this prediction was confirmed by the later n - body models of loebman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who employed slightly different treatments of radial mixing and star formation in their simulated disks from schnrich & binney ( 2009a , b ) , but found a gradient of @xmath219.7 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3for younger stars ( identified with the thin - disk component with low [ @xmath0/fe ] ) in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath134 kpc and @xmath135 @xmath46  @xmath136 kpc ) .",
    "our observed gradient of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] for the thin - disk stars in the range @xmath137 kpc ( @xmath138 km s@xmath3",
    "dex@xmath3 ) is not far from the estimate of @xmath220 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3  obtained by loebman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for their simulated sample of young , low-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars in their @xmath139 , which covers the same interval in height above the plane .",
    "note that the scale of their [ @xmath0/fe]determinations and ours are slightly different , and they also employed the predicted oxygen abundance ratio as a proxy for [ @xmath0/fe ] , rather than the averages employed in our estimates .",
    "it appears that an overall velocity gradient of @xmath97 to @xmath98 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3with metallicity for the thin - disk subsample qualitatively agrees well with the expectations from the radial migration models .",
    "the extended tail of low-[@xmath0/fe ]  metal - poor stars observed in figures 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 can be also explained by the radial migration scenario .",
    "rokar et al .",
    "( 2008b ) found that their simulated disk stars ( when allowed to mix radially ) exhibited a mdf more like the observations by holmberg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) than that obtained from an @xmath8 sample without radial migration .",
    "these authors concluded that radial migration was the likely cause of the broader mdf , which is also supported by our present data .",
    "it is noteworthy that our observed negative gradient of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] for the thin - disk stars ( @xmath97 to @xmath98 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3 ) stands in contradiction to expectations from traditional local evolution models in the solar neighborhood ( without allowing for mixing or migration of stars ) , which predict a _ positive slope _ of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] . according to these models ,",
    "the stars that were born early in the history of star formation in the thin disk are expected to be relatively metal - poor .",
    "these old metal - poor thin - disk stars should have experienced more perturbations , such as from variations in the galactic potential over time . as a result",
    ", such stars are expected to exhibit slower rotational velocities and larger velocity dispersions than the younger , more metal - rich thin - disk stars .",
    "this inevitably leads to the expected production of a positive gradient of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ] , which we clearly do not find .    when considering the radial migration models for the thick disk the case differs somewhat , in particular due to the much older ages of these stars .",
    "according to these models , it is expected that most of the thick - disk stars that exist in the solar neighborhood today were born with high velocity dispersion in the inner portion of the galaxy , in regions of higher local density , at a time when the metallicity of the ism was relatively low and the @xmath0-abundance ratios were high .",
    "as they migrated outward over time , the lower gravitational restoring force of the local disk allowed these stars to explore orbits reaching higher above or below the plane .",
    "relatively few thick - disk stars are thought to have migrated inward from the outer disk region .",
    "these old stars had more time to experience mixing of their orbits ; in the case of complete mixing for these older stars , one might expect little or no trends between rotational velocity and metallicity .",
    "schnrich & binney ( 2009a , b ) did not make predictions of velocity trends with metallicity , on the grounds that insufficient knowledge of the earliest phases of disk formation exists to constrain expectations for such a potential gradient ( i.e. , unknown initial conditions ) .",
    "however , loebman et al . (",
    "2010 ) reported from their simulation an insignificant gradient of @xmath41.4 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3  for these older stars ( @xmath140 gyr , which generally matched the observed properties of the thick - disk component , e.g. , high [ @xmath0/fe]ratios ) .",
    "even though the migration strength in their simulation induced substantial mixing , the process was still incomplete .",
    "thus , it would allow for the conservation of significant velocity / metallicity trends .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that their model was not specifically intended to match the properties of the milky way .    in any case , the small or absent predicted correlations between @xmath42  and [ fe / h]for the high-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars from the migration models are in contrast to our determination of a steep gradient of @xmath99 to @xmath100 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3  for the observed high-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars we associate with the thick disk , as shown in figure [ fig : fehvphizd ] .",
    "thus , this trend of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ]  for the thick - disk subsample can provide a useful constraint to the radial migration models mentioned above .    in summary ,",
    "the observed correlations between @xmath42  and [ fe / h ] for our low-[@xmath0/fe ]  ( thin - disk ) stars can be naturally explained by the radial migration of stars from the outer disk ( more metal - poor stars ) and from the inner disk ( more metal - rich stars ) into the solar vicinity , as predicted by the migration models . as explained by schnrich & binney ( 2009b ) ,",
    "such a velocity gradient arises from the interplay between the churning and the blurring processes .",
    "the behavior of the high-[@xmath0/fe ]  ( thick - disk ) stars is rather different ( exhibiting a much steeper gradient ) than expected from the simulated high-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars of loebman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , although there remains the uncertainty of how well thick - disk stars are represented in these models , and how well the models match the actual history of the milky way .",
    "it appears that stellar radial migration may have played an important role in the evolution of the thin disk , but , based on the information available from the current radial migration models and simulations , it is difficult to ascertain the relative importance of radial migration for the formation and/or evolution of the thick disk .      the gas - rich merger model of brook et al .",
    "( 2007 ) predicts a correlation between @xmath42  and @xmath45 for stars in the disk system . according to their simulations ( especially their figure 5 ) there",
    "should exist a detectable velocity gradient for the thin disk in the region of the solar neighborhood ( @xmath45 = 710 kpc ) .",
    "this differs from our null gradient for the thin - disk subsample .",
    "their simulations also indicate a negligible gradient for their thick - disk stars ( which they refer to as `` merger stars '' ) , which is at least qualitatively in line with our small value of @xmath104 km s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that , as richard et al .",

    "( 2007 ) performed a simulation with a particular set of parameters to produce their disk systems , which may not necessarily match those of the galaxy .",
    "for example , one rather large difference between this particular simulation and our results is that , while we find a difference in velocity lag of about 30 km s@xmath3between our thin and thick - disk subsamples , the @xmath141-body prediction calls for a difference of over 150 km s@xmath3 .",
    "additional simulations of this process , better matched to the nature of the milky way , would clearly be useful to compare our results with .",
    "the dynamical heating of a pre - existing thin disk , as modeled by the simulations from villalobos et al . ( 2010 ) also predicts gradients of @xmath42  with respect to both @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "looking at their figure 14 , the thickened - disk component exhibits a very weak trend of @xmath42  with @xmath45 for low initial orbital inclination of the merging satellite , while the correlation between the two quantities becomes stronger as the incidence angle is increased .",
    "concerning the gradient of @xmath42  with @xmath46 , it is evident in their figure 14 that the vertical gradient of @xmath42  is much shallower at higher orbital inclination .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , our radial gradient of @xmath42  for the thick - disk subsample agrees better with that expected for low orbital inclination of the merging satellite , but our vertical gradient is better matched by mergers with high orbital inclination .",
    "this may indicate that the compromise case of intermediate orbital inclination ( @xmath142 ) best describes our observed results , a possibility also considered by villalobos et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in any event",
    ", the comparisons of our thick - disk subsample with this particular model prediction imply that if the heating scenario played a major role in the formation of the thick disk , the initial orbital inclination of the merging satellite could not have been too small or too large . of course",
    ", it is also possible that multiple satellite mergers may have been involved , which complicates these simple comparisons with a single merger .    in summary , comparisons of our data with the gas - rich merger model from brook et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that , while this model may not explain the lack of a rotational velocity gradient with galactocentric distance for the thin disk , it does account for that observed for the thick disk . however , the much larger difference in the velocity lag than our finding between the thin- and thick - disk stars remains to be resolved .",
    "the model of thin - disk heating by mergers of villalobos et al .",
    "( 2010 ) qualitatively agrees with the expected kinematic features of our thick - disk subsample , assuming that the merging satellite has an intermediate orbital inclination .    in the previous section , which considered correlations between @xmath42  and [ fe / h ] ,",
    "our results for the thin - disk population were shown to be in qualitative accord with predictions of the radial migration models , while those for our thick - disk population might not be . in order to be confident of the implications of this result",
    ", one would like to compare with the predictions from more refined radial migration models that better reproduce the observed properties of the thick - disk population . on the other hand , the relationship between @xmath42  with @xmath45 and @xmath46  for the high-[@xmath0/fe ]  stars agrees better with the predictions of the gas - rich merger and thin - disk heating models that we have considered here . taken as a whole ,",
    "the presently available comparisons of the various observed gradients suggest that the thick disk may have formed from either the mergers of gas - rich systems or the heating of a pre - existing thin disk by mergers , and has been little influenced by the secular process of stellar migration , while radial migration may well have strongly affected the evolution of the thin disk .",
    "sales et al .",
    "( 2009 ) demonstrated that the orbital eccentricities of a stellar population could also be used as a tool to probe the formation and evolution mechanisms of the disk system .",
    "in particular , taken at face value ( and recognizing that their summary only pertains to a limited set of model parameters and histories ) , their figure 3 suggests that radial migration models ( e.g. , rokar et al .",
    "2008a ) generate symmetric distributions of stellar eccentricities with rather narrow widths , while the gas - rich merger models ( e.g. , brook et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) produce distributions that are skewed toward higher eccentricity with larger widths .",
    "the accretion models ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) distribute the eccentricities rather broadly over a wide range . for the disk heating scenario ( e.g. , villalobos & helmi 2008 )",
    ", there is a similarity of the eccentricity distribution with that of the merger model for @xmath143 , but there exists a secondary peak at high eccentricity ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "generally , they found that violent models such as disk heating and accretion generated a distribution of stellar orbital eccentricities spanning a large range , with secondary peaks at higher eccentricity , or at least with rather broad distributions of high eccentricity stars .",
    "by contrast , the smooth transition models , such as radial migration or @xmath8 star formation from gas - rich mergers produced distributions dominated by lower eccentricity orbits covering relatively narrower ranges .    several studies have compared the above expectations from these models to observed distributions of orbital eccentricities for thick - disk stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "wilson et al . ( 2011 ) , for example , investigated the eccentricity distribution of a sample of thick - disk stars from rave .",
    "they concluded that their observed distribution , which peaked at low eccentricity and exhibited a lack of high eccentricity stars , disfavored the pure accretion model of abadi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and was most consistent with the predictions of gas - rich merger models .",
    "dierickx et al .",
    "( 2010 ) carried out a similar test , using a large sample of dwarfs from sdss dr7 , and suggested that their sample favored the gas - rich merger scenario as well .",
    "casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) performed an analysis using a sample of @xmath154400 red clump thick - disk stars from rave data release 2 ( zwitter et al .",
    "2008 ) with available proper motions from spm4 .",
    "their comparison of the derived orbital eccentricity distribution with model predictions supported the gas - rich merger scenario , or possibly the minor merger heating model ( arguing that the expected secondary peak at high eccentricity could be avoided , depending on the initial orbital configuration of the merging satellite(s ) ) .",
    "indeed , a recent simulation study by di matteo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that , with the adoption of a particular set of initial conditions ( a 1:10 mass ratio and direct orbit of a presumed single interacting satellite ) , the disk heating model could also produce the distribution of eccentricities observed by wilson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and dierickx et al .",
    "( 2010 ) _ without _ creating a secondary peak at high eccentricity , confirming that the heating model may also be a viable mechanism for thick - disk formation .",
    "it is noteworthy that the various observational studies , based on different samples , with different distance estimates , and adopting different models for the milky way potential , all produce similar eccentricity distributions for the thick - disk population  a broad peak at low eccentricity and a lack of high eccentricity stars .",
    "considering all of the studies mentioned above , the favored mechanisms for thick - disk formation are likely to be either ( or both ) the gas - rich mergers model or the thin - disk heating by minor mergers scenario , at least when considering only stellar orbital eccentricities as a probe .",
    "all of these studies rejected the pure accretion model of thick - disk formation ( as advocated by abadi et al .",
    "2003 ) .    unlike the previous observational studies mentioned above , which selected thick - disk stars mostly on the basis of spatial extent , we have selected a subsample of likely thick - disk stars based on their measured [ @xmath0/fe ] , as described in section 3 .",
    "we now compare the eccentricity distribution of our thick - disk subsample with expectations from each model cited in sales et al .",
    "the left - hand set of panels of figure [ fig : eccdist ] displays the normalized distributions of eccentricity for the low-[@xmath0/fe ]  ( top left ) and high-[@xmath0/fe ]  ( top right ) populations . each distribution in the top two panels is restricted to different slices on distance from the galactic plane , as listed in the figure legend .",
    "the @xmath49 distribution of the entire g - dwarf sample ( without splits based on [ @xmath0/fe ] ) , divided into regions that should emphasize the thin- and thick - disk regions , is shown in the bottom left and bottom right panels , respectively .",
    "the eccentricity distributions of the thin - disk subsample peak at much less than @xmath145 , with narrow widths , and apparently include very few high eccentricity stars ( @xmath146 ) for the two @xmath46  regions shown in the top left panel .",
    "in contrast , the distributions for the thick - disk subsample shown in the top right panel peak at @xmath1470.2 , and exhibit extended tails of higher eccentricities up to @xmath1470.8 ; there remains a relative lack of high eccentricity stars ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "although we find that the relative frequency of the high-@xmath49 stars increases a bit at larger @xmath46  distance ( red dashed line ) for both subsamples , the distributions otherwise do not change significantly .",
    "this again confirms that the population separation based on [ @xmath0/fe]appears to work quite well .",
    "the eccentricity distributions for the full sample of g - dwarf stars exhibits some rather interesting features . even at large @xmath46distance ( 0.82.4 kpc , bottom right )",
    ", where the thick - disk stars should dominate , the eccentricity _ does not appear similar _ to that of the thick - disk subsample separated by [ @xmath0/fe ]  ( top right panel ) in either range of @xmath46  distance ; the peak and the width do not match .",
    "this underscores once more that , for the purpose of the selection of thick - disk stellar samples , purely spatial separations are insufficient .",

( 2009 ) , as shown in the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : eccdist ] , the relative shortage of high eccentricity stars and the absence of the secondary peak at high @xmath1470.8 in our observed distribution exclude the accretion origin and the disk heating model for the thick disk .",
    "although the distribution expected from the radial migration models provides a viable description of stars in the low eccentricity region , it fails to capture the observed high eccentricity tail of the thick - disk stars .",
    "the skewed distribution of observed eccentricities toward higher values is not well - represented by the radial migration predictions , which exhibit a more gaussian - like shape ( lower left panel of the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : eccdist ] ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that an alternative radial migration model by schnrich & binney ( 2009a , b ) indicates the presence of a peak eccentricity between 0.1 and 0.2 , with an extended tail towards high eccentricities , which is consistent with the shape of the observed @xmath49 distribution of our thick - disk sample .",
    "hence , we must be cautious in drawing firm conclusions on the formation mechanisms of the thick disk due to their apparent sensitivity to details of the models and simulations . solely based on comparisons with the predictions in the published models from sales et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , it seems that our eccentricity distribution most closely resembles that predicted from the gas - rich merger scenario .",
    "the eccentricity distribution of our thick - disk subsample differs little from the disk heating model of the di matteo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) simulation . as identified by this simulation ( and also mentioned in the discussions of the observations of casetti - dinescu et al .",
    "2011 and wilson et al .",
    "2011 ) , the secondary peak or high eccentricity region ( @xmath148 ) in the disk heating model is mostly occupied by the accreted stars ( which retain the initial orbital characteristics of the merging satellite ) .",
    "in addition , depending on the initial conditions ( especially the orbital inclination of the interacting satellite ) of the simulation , the high eccentricity secondary peak may ( or may not ) be seen in the predicted distribution of the eccentricities . in particular ,",
    "the small satellite mass ( 1:10 mass ratio ) in the di matteo et al .",
    "simulation would likely not contribute large numbers of stars to the solar neighborhood .",
    "it appears from our observed eccentricity distribution , and that of others , that the inclination of the merging small galaxy in the simulation of the disk heating model in sales et al .",
    "( 2009 ) may be less than 30@xmath149 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the findings from the correlations of @xmath42  with @xmath45 and @xmath46  in the previous section .",
    "we stress that the existence of the secondary peak at high eccentricity and clear identification of the extended tail of the high eccentricity with observational data can provide strong constraints on the initial conditions on the merger or heating models .",
    "the observed eccentricity distribution of the full g - dwarf sample at larger distances from the galactic plane , or for the thick - disk population with high [ @xmath0/fe ]  ratios , rule out a broad peak at intermediate eccentricity .",
    "this argues strongly against the importance of an accretion origin of the thick - disk component , unless the accretion model can explain the dominant population in the low eccentricity regime . at this stage , confident distinction between the other published models is infeasible because uncertainties in the initial conditions , in the @xmath141-body simulations themselves ( e.g. , artificial heating ) , and in the assumed model parameters ( potential , secular heating , star formation histories , etc . )",
    "can produce differences that are roughly comparable to the predicted differences _ between _ various scenarios .",

    "a separate test was carried out to eliminate a small number of stars that had larger probability of being associated with the halo than the disk system .    unlike the conventional assignment of stars into thin- and thick - disk components based on kinematics ( or spatial distribution )",
    ", we have made use of [ @xmath0/fe ]  as a reference to _ chemically divide _ our g - dwarf sample into likely thin - disk and thick - disk populations .",
    "our chemically separated populations indicate that a negative rotational velocity gradient with increasing [ fe / h ] exists for the thin - disk population ( @xmath150 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3 ) , while the thick - disk population exhibits a positive slope ( @xmath151 km s@xmath3  dex@xmath3 ) in the range @xmath152 kpc and @xmath45 = 710 kpc .",
    "larger mean orbital radii are also noticed among the metal - poor thin - disk stars , as compared to the more metal - rich thin - disk stars , and smaller mean orbital radii are found for the thick - disk stars compared with the thin - disk stars .",

    "this also allows us to infer that division by chemistry reveals the kinematic structure of each population better than division on the basis of spatial separation .",
    "the vertical gradient of @xmath42  with @xmath46  for our thick - disk subsample ( @xmath107 km s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 ) is smaller than that reported by casetti - dinescu et al .",

    "the difference in average orbital eccentricity between the low-[@xmath0/fe ]  and high-[@xmath0/fe ]  subsamples appears constant at any given @xmath46  ( about 0.1 ) , which also indicates a clear distinction between these populations .",
    "our approach of separating the thin - disk and thick - disk components by chemical tagging on their [ @xmath0/fe ]  abundance ratios yields well - defined , and distinct , kinematic trends for these populations as listed in table [ tab : obs ] .",

    "then , by adopting the improved expression by bond et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we estimate the photometric metallicities for our sample .",

    "all colors are reddening corrected , and note that the coefficient of the @xmath163 term is zero .",
    "we refer to the distance determined with equation [ eqn : dist ] as the `` photometric distance '' , the metallicity estimated by equation [ eqn : feh ] as the `` photometric metallicity '' , and the rotation velocity calculated using the photometric distance in combination with the measured radial velocities and proper motions as the `` photometric rotational velocity '' .",
    "the label `` phot '' in figures [ fig : zeljkodiff ] and [ fig : zeljko ] indicate these estimates , while the label `` sspp '' denotes the values we have used for the g - dwarf sample .",

    "the bottom panel displays the trend of our values of @xmath42  vs. the photometric metallicity , and a very similar pattern between the middle and the bottom panel is observed .",
    "the error bar on each point is calculated by resampling 100 stars with replacement 1000 times.,width=453,height=566 ]      figure [ fig : zeljkodiff ] shows scatter plots ( left panels ) and histograms ( right panels ) of the differences in [ fe / h ] , distance , and @xmath42  between the photometric ( phot ) estimates and our estimates ( sspp ) for stars in @xmath46  = 1.01.5 kpc from our g - dwarf sample considered in this paper .",
    "it can be noticed from inspection of the top panels that the photometric metallicity is consistently higher at low [ fe / h ] and lower at high [ fe / h ] , compared to the sspp estimates , with an overall shift of about 0.1 dex ( top right panel ) .",
    "the middle panels suggest that our distance determination is on average @xmath150.1 kpc lower than the photometric estimate , with a trend that this deviation becomes larger as the distance increases .",
    "the bottom panels show that our rotational velocities generally agree with the photometric rotational velocities , but our values trend higher at low @xmath42",
    ".    with these differences ( especially for [ fe / h ] ) kept in mind , we have examined the trend of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ]  based on the photometric estimates and based on the spectroscopic estimates , for stars in the range @xmath46  = 1.01.5 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : zeljko ] shows the results .",
    "the top panel makes use of the spectroscopically - derived quantities , while the middle panel comes from the photometric quantities . due to the small difference in the distance estimates ( larger distances for the photometric distance ) , we see in the middle panel that there are more objects selected in this @xmath46  distance range , which does not affect our conclusions .",
    "it is obvious that we obtain a flattening of the @xmath42  relationship below [ fe / h ] @xmath155 for the photometrically - determined values . even if we consider the photometric metallicity and _ our values _ of @xmath42 , we obtain a very similar pattern ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the effect of the input metallicity in equation [ eqn : dist ] on distance for calculation of @xmath42  is minimal .",
    "however , it is clear that the difference between use of the photometric metallicity and the spectroscopic metallicity makes a large difference in the derived trend of @xmath42 .",
    "this can be accounted for by the scattering of higher metallicity stars ( which have high @xmath42 ) into the photometrically determined low - metallicity region , resulting in a flatter gradient of @xmath42  with [ fe / h ]  for stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath155 , as seen by comparing the middle panel of figure [ fig : zeljko ] with the top panel .",
    "there are at least two reasons that the photometric metallicity relation in equation [ eqn : feh ] may assign the metallicity of a star to a value that strongly deviates from that estimated from the sspp .",
    "first , equation [ eqn : feh ] was not calibrated with the metallicity estimates used in this study , but with those available in dr7 . there has been significant improvement in the sspp for estimation of [ fe / h ] since the dr7 release , especially for stars with near - solar and super - solar values ( see smolinski et al .",
    "2011 ) . for a proper comparison",
    ", the photometric metallicity relation needs to be re - calibrated with the metallicities available from the dr8 release .",
    "the other reason is that small random errors in the photometric measurements ( and zero points ) can strongly influence the photometric metallicity estimate ( and its errors ) (  .",
    "ivezi et al . in preparation ) . as a result",
    ", stars that are in reality of high metallicity can be artificially moved into the low - metallicity region ."
