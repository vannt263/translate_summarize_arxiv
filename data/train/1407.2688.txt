    "+ to get trivial knot diagram from @xmath20 , we need to make region crossing changes such that sum of signs of crossings in either horizontal or vertical tangle become @xmath55 . in other words , to transform @xmath20 to unknot by region crossing changes , we need to reduce either @xmath25 or @xmath13 to @xmath55 . in this process of selection of regions , observe that a region crossing change at any one of @xmath69 in @xmath20 will reduce @xmath25 to @xmath70 or @xmath13 to @xmath71 respectively and hence at each step , the absolute value of the sum of signs of crossings of either horizontal or vertical tangle reduce by @xmath0 .",
