    "the quantitative macroscopic description of liquid crystals ( lc ) in terms of partial differential dynamic equations , free energy functionals , ginzburg - landau energies and the like , has been developed over the last 50 years @xcite - @xcite . for a long time , it has been sufficient to consider nematic - like phases with preferred ( non - polar ) directions or smectic ( and columnar ) phases with one - dimensional layer ( or two - dimensional lattice ) structures . with the advent of bent - core ( or banana )",
    "lc @xcite this has changed considerably .",
    "it turned out that , first , polar ( vector ) order plays an important role , in particular in smectic - like structures , and second , tetrahedral order is an additional type of order , necessary to describe the phases found in these new materials .",
    "we will only briefly discuss the role of polar order , but concentrate on the various aspects of tetrahedral order . to do that we first recall the traditional types of orientational order , give some motivations why these are insufficient in the case of bent - core materials , and then discuss tetrahedral order and and its interplay with other types of orientational order .",
    "in the subsequent sections [ td ] - [ tnnotcorr ] we give detailed accounts of the hydrodynamics of the various phases where tetrahedral order is involved . the experimental situation is discussed in section [ exper ] , followed by a summary and perspective , section [ sum ] .",
    "liquid crystals generally are anisotropic fluids .",
    "this is due to the existence of one ( or more ) preferred directions in the fluid , either due to rotational order ( _ e.g. _ nematic lcs ) , or translational order ( _ e.g. _ smectic and columnar lcs ) , or both ( _ e.g. _ smectic c lcs ) . as a result , at least some of their ( macroscopic ) material properties , like _ e.g. _ heat conduction , viscosity , or sound velocity , depend on the orientation .",
    "thereby , the rotational and/or translational symmetry of isotropic liquids is spontaneously broken by the occurrence of ordered structures at an equilibrium phase transition .",
    "the latter can be obtained by changing some control parameters , like temperature , pressure or concentration ( in a mixture ) leading to the distinction of thermotropic , barotropic , and lyotropic lcs , respectively .",
    "well - known are ( uniaxial thermotropic ) nematic lc , consisting of rod - like or plate - like molecules that are disordered in the isotropic state . when cooling down into the nematic phase they spontaneously align their preferred molecular axes in the mean forming a macroscopic preferred direction , the director @xmath1 , with @xmath2 rendering the phase anisotropic . in nematic",
    "lc one can not discriminate between the director and its opposite direction ( no `` head '' or `` tail '' ) , even if the molecular axes do have this distinction .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is not a true vector .",
    "the common procedure to circumvent this shortcoming is to use use @xmath1 as a true vector with the additional requirement that all macroscopic equations are invariant under the exchange of @xmath1 with @xmath3 .",
    "the ( uniaxial ) nematic order is described by the quadrupolar , traceless symmetric order parameter tensor , correctly reflecting the @xmath1 to @xmath3 invariance , @xmath4 due to its quadrupolar structure no vector can be extracted from it . here",
    ", @xmath5 , the strength of the order , is the second moment of the microscopic orientations of all molecules with respect to the preferred direction @xmath1 .",
    "there is @xmath6 in the isotropic phase , and the extremum values @xmath7 and @xmath8 for perfect order in the rod - like and plate - like case , respectively . a realistic value for many rod - like nematic lc is @xmath9 within the nematic phase , which decreases approaching the nematic to isotropic phase transition , with a jump of @xmath10 at the transition .",
    "it can be measured _",
    "e.g. _ through the dielectric anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the order is spontaneous and the orientation of @xmath1 is arbitrary , as long as there are no orienting external fields or boundaries .",
    "therefore , the two rotations of the director , @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) , are the slow additional hydrodynamic variables ( `` symmetry variables '' ) due to the nematic order @xcite . deviations of the order parameter @xmath5 from its equilibrium value relax in a finite time ( except near phase transitions ) and are often neglected .    in case",
    "the molecules order themselves with respect to two different molecular directions , a biaxial order results with the order parameter tensor @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a measure for biaxiality .",
    "the directions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are directors with a @xmath15 to @xmath17 and @xmath16 to @xmath18 invariance . depending on the symmetries of the phase considered there can be additional relations between the directors , _",
    "e.g. _ for orthorhombic phases the three directors have to be mutually orthogonal .",
    "the symmetry variables are the three rotations of the rigid tripod @xmath19 , _",
    "e.g. _ described by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . for finite rotations , that is in a nonlinear description , these variables do not commute @xcite .",
    "a different type of orientational order is polar order . in polar nematic lc",
    "the preferred direction is a true vector , with `` head '' and `` tail '' distinguishable .",
    "the order parameter is the polarization vector @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 , the value of the spontaneous polarization that characterizes the strength of the polar order , and @xmath25 the unit vector that denotes the ( arbitrary ) orientation of the polar direction . for rod - like systems ,",
    "thermotropic polar nematic lc are rare in nature .",
    "one reason might be that a finite sample of homogeneous ( @xmath26 ) polar nematic lc exhibit opposite surface charges in the planes perpendicular to @xmath25 , which give rise to destabilizing electrostatic forces .",
    "second , the homogeneous state is not the energetic ground state , since the existence of @xmath27 allows for spontaneous structures with a constant splay texture @xcite .",
    "however , the latter can not be space filling and is necessarily connected to defects .",
    "the hydrodynamic variables are the two rotations of the polarization direction , @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) .",

    "[ fig:2],title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    for bent - core molecules the situation is rather different .",
    "typically they have a non - polar ( long ) axis , @xmath33 and perpendicularly a ( short ) polar axis @xmath34 , cf . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "they can align in layered structures to form various smectic phases with polar properties ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "there are two untilted phases , c@xmath35 with the nematic axis @xmath1 along the layer normal and the polar axis @xmath25 within the layer @xcite , and c@xmath36 , vice versa .",
    "both are of @xmath37 symmetry .",
    "one can tilt the c@xmath35 structure in two ways .",
    "rotation about the polar axis results in the c@xmath38 phase of @xmath39 symmetry and rotating about the @xmath40 direction gives the c@xmath41 phase of @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "if both ways of tilting are combined , the c@xmath32 phase arises , where no symmetry element is left ( @xmath43 ) @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath38 and c@xmath44 phases are chiral due to their structure , even when the molecules are achiral .",
    "this allows for the occurrence of energetically equivalent left- and right - handed helices @xcite ( called ambidextrous chirality ) .",
    "if layers of different polarization direction and/or different tilt direction are stacked , various overall structures with different properties can be obtained , _ e.g. _",
    "ferro- , ferri- , or antiferroelectric , and helical or non - helical@xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of polar columnar phases @xcite .",
    "if bent - core molecules align both their axes in a biaxial nematic way , the result is a polar biaxial nematic phase ( n@xmath45 ) of @xmath46 symmetry @xcite .    a different type of polar order can occur in active systems , like schools of fish , bird flocks , insect swarms , growing bacteria , and biological motors .",
    "if the active part of those systems moves relative to a passive background , the relative velocity denotes a preferred polar direction @xcite .",
    "this type of order is dynamic , since it is provided by the motion of the active part and vanishes , when the motion stops .",
    "it does not occur spontaneously by an equilibrium phase transition from an disordered to an ordered state , but is due to the ( internal ) driving typically via chemical reactions ( food consumption , metabolism ) .",
    "the active state is a non - equilibrium one , constantly dissipating the supplied energy .",
    "if the driving stops , the system falls back into a passive , disordered state @xcite .",
    "the order parameter in this case is the relative velocity @xmath47 where the amount of the velocity , @xmath48 , is a measure of the strength of the order .",
    "its non - zero value even in a stationary state , is due to the driving and indicates the non - equilibrium nature of the system .",
    "the unit velocity , @xmath49 , is a polar vector and characterizes the direction of the polar order .",
    "this direction is not prescribed by the driving and is therefore arbitrary .",
    "its two rotations are the symmetry variables . in that respect @xmath49 is similar to the polar nematic case , @xmath25 . however , a velocity changes sign under time reversal , while a polarization does not .",
    "therefore , the hydrodynamics of active polar systems is quite different from that of ( passive ) polar nematic lc .",
    "in particular , the former systems exhibit new non - trivial couplings among various hydrodynamic variables , linear advection properties , active stresses , second sound , and asymmetries between forward and backward traveling sound excitations , which is a clear indication of non - equilibrium @xcite .      during the development of more sophisticated bent - core materials",
    ", it became apparent that an important ingredient in the macroscopic description was still missing .",
    "compounds were found that showed a phase transition between two different ( optically ) isotropic phases .",
    "being one of them the true isotropic phase without any order , the other must have a type of order that is not detectable in a microscope , meaning the dielectric tensor has to be isotropic .",
    "that immediately rules out polar or nematic order .",
    "obviously , tetrahedral order @xcite - @xcite does qualify , since it is described by a third rank tensor @xmath50 , that can not influence lower rank material tensors , like the rank-2 dielectric tensor .",
    "in analogy to the nematic order that has the quadrupolar structure of a second moment of an orientational distribution , tetrahedral order can be called octupolar , since it is related to the third moment .",
    "the tetrahedral ( octupolar ) order parameter @xmath51 is a fully symmetric rank-3 tensor expressed by an amplitude @xmath52 and by the 4 tetrahedral unit vectors , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 defining a tetrahedron , cf .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for actual calculations one can use _",
    "e.g. _ the representation of @xmath50 @xcite @xmath55 that is used in the left hand sides of figs .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the tetrahedral structure has four 3-fold symmetry axes , the tetrahedral vectors @xmath56 , and three 2-fold ( proper ) and 4-fold improper ( @xmath57 ) , symmetry axis , the cartesian directions x , y , z in eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) .",
    "the latter means that a 90@xmath58 rotation about such an axis has to be followed by a spatial inversion , in order to arrive at the initial structure , cf .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "inversion is an operation , where a structure is either reflected through a point in space , or mirrored by three mutually orthogonal planes .",
    "if the resulting structure is different from the original one , inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "the existence of improper rotation axes is a sign of broken inversion symmetry .",
    "another useful representation of the tetrahedral structure is @xmath59 where one tetrahedral vector is along the z - axis , and one of the remaining three has a lateral projection along the x - axis , only .",
    "note that both structures , eqs .",
    "( [ unit ] ) and ( [ unite ] ) , have an inverted counter part ( all signs within the braces changed , shown on the right hand sides of figs . [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] ) ; those are different from the original ones , but can be used equivalently to describe the structures .    a phase that has only tetrahedral order is of @xmath60 symmetry , a subgroup of cubic symmetry .",
    "it breaks inversion symmetry , since @xmath50 changes sign under inversion due to the odd number of ( tetrahedral ) vectors involved .",
    "it is non - polar , _ i.e. _ one can not extract a vector from @xmath50 , because of @xmath61 .",
    "it does not imply any nematic order , since @xmath62 is isotropic . because of the two mirror planes , defined by two non - adjacent tetrahedral vectors ( _ e.g. _ 1/4 or 2/3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , chirality is also excluded . only if the molecules themselves are chiral , a phase of ( chiral ) @xmath63 symmetry arises , which will be dealt with below , separately .    , width=313 ]     onto the x / y plane ; stars and rings mean a vector points out of , or into , the drawing plane , respectively .",
    "the two structures differ by a 90@xmath58 rotation about the z - axis ",
    "note that the actual numbering of the tetrahedral vectors is irrelevant , since they are all equivalent.[fig:4],title=\"fig:\",width=132 ]   onto the x / y plane ; stars and rings mean a vector points out of , or into , the drawing plane , respectively .",
    "the two structures differ by a 90@xmath58 rotation about the z - axis ",
    "note that the actual numbering of the tetrahedral vectors is irrelevant , since they are all equivalent.[fig:4],title=\"fig:\",width=132 ]    a trivial example for broken inversion symmetry is polar order , since @xmath25 becomes @xmath64 after inversion , which is different from the original structure .",
    "on the other hand , nematic order @xmath65 is invariant under inversion .",
    "inversion symmetry is also broken in chiral systems , where a pseudoscalar exists , typically called @xmath66 , that changes sign under inversion and reflects the two possibilities of left- and right - handed structures . however , the broken inversion symmetry in tetrahedral order is quite different , since it does not show polarity , nor chirality .    among the peculiar features , which we will discuss in detail in section [ td ] , is the possibility that an applied external electric field leads to ( i ) a temperature shift of the ( optically isotropic ) tetrahedral to nematic phase transition and ( ii ) induces nematic order in the t@xmath0  phase .",
    "both , the transition shift and the induced order are proportional to the field strength @xcite , rather than to the square of the field strength , as it is common when only ordinary isotropic phases are involved .",
    "the experimental detection of such linear - field strength transition shifts @xcite accompanied by flow phenomena in some bent - core materials is another indication that tetrahedral order plays an important role for these systems .",
    "another consequence of the broken inversion symmetry in tetrahedral phases is the reversible coupling of flow to ( vectorial ) generalized forces , like electric fields or gradients of temperature or concentration .",
    "this piezo - like dynamic coupling constitutes ambi - polarity : although polar fluxes are induced , the inverted @xmath50 structure gives fluxes in the opposite direction and the overall phase is non - polar .    an external electric field ( but not a magnetic one ) not only orients the tetrahedral structure such that one of the tetrahedral vectors , @xmath67 , is parallel or antiparallel to the field @xcite , it also imposes a torque on the other three @xcite .",
    "if the tetrahedral structure is soft enough and the field @xmath68 high enough , a deformed structure is obtained , where the angle between @xmath67 and the others is reduced , asymptotically ( @xmath69 ) to @xmath70 giving a pyramidal structure , cf .",
    "section [ tdstrong ] .",
    "in addition , there is an overall rotation about @xmath67 ( or @xmath71 ) , whose rotation sense is reversed for the inverted tetrahedral structure or if the electric field is reversed .",
    "if the molecules are chiral , the chiral tetrahedral phase t can be obtained @xcite .",
    "its @xmath63 symmetry does not occur . ]",
    "lacks any mirror plane and the tetrahedral @xmath57 axes of the t@xmath0  phase are reduced to ( proper ) 2-fold axes .",
    "there is a pseudoscalar @xmath66 of molecular origin .",
    "similar to the case of cholesteric lc a helical structure of a given handedness reduces the free energy , but only if the helical axis is one of the tetrahedral vectors ( the 3-fold symmetry axes ) .",
    "there are appropriate static as well as dissipative lehmann - type couplings @xcite among rotations of the tetrahedral structure and _ e.g. _ the thermal degree of freedom .",
    "in contrast to the t@xmath0  phase , there is flow alignment in the chiral t phase , in particular , for simple shear flow ( with the vorticity direction along one of the tetrahedral vectors ) the tetrahedral structure is rotated about this direction by an angle that depends on @xmath66 , but not on the shear rate , @xcite and section [ chiralt ] .      in a system where both , nematic ( @xmath65 ) and tetrahedral order ( @xmath50 ) exist simultaneously ,",
    "the overall symmetry of the possible phases depend on the relative orientation of the two structures .",
    "this problem is investigated using a landau description setting up a free energy in terms of the two order parameter tensors @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the well - known landau energy expressions for a ( pure ) nematic @xcite and a ( pure ) tetrahedral phase @xcite , respectively .",
    "they contain terms quadratic , cubic and quartic in the order parameter in the first case , but only quadratic and quartic ones in the second case , due to the broken inversion symmetry of @xmath50 .",
    "since the orientational symmetry is broken _ spontaneously _ in a nematic phase as well as in a tetrahedral phase , @xmath73 and @xmath75 can not depend on the relative orientation of the two structures .",
    "thus , the minimum of the mixed landau energy @xmath76 gives the ground state of the combined system .",
    "it is of fourth order in the order parameters and might therefore be small , in particular close to the phase transition .",
    "we will therefore consider two cases , first the strong coupling limit , where @xmath77 is large and leads to a rigid relative orientation of the two structures ( `` correlated order '' ) in section [ tncorr ] , and the weak coupling limit , where @xmath77 is neglected ( `` uncorrelated order '' ) in section [ tnnotcorr ] , where other energies become important .",
    "for the case of correlated order there are two well - defined distinct geometries ( restricting ourselves for the moment to uniaxial nematic order ) : either the nematic director is along of one of the 2-fold ( or @xmath57 ) symmetry axes of the tetrahedral structure , or it is along one of the 3-fold axes , the tetrahedral vectors . to show that these two possibilities indeed lead to energetic minima , one can take , without loss of generality , the director along the z - axis , with the tetrahedral structure given in eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ unite ] ) , for the first and second case respectively . indeed , the first case is the ground state , if @xmath78 , while @xmath79 gives the second one .    in the first case ( the director along a @xmath57 axis ) a tetragonal biaxial structure is obtained that lacks inversion symmetry .",
    "it is of @xmath80 symmetry and its hydrodynamics is discussed in detail in section [ d2d ] .",
    "the hallmark of this phase is the existence of ambidextrous helicity @xcite .",
    "although this phase is not chiral , the formation of a non - homogeneous ground state in the form of a helix is possible .",
    "the combined tetragonal biaxial structure rotates about one of the @xmath57 axes that are perpendicular to the director , when going along this helical axis .",
    "the physical origin is the broken inversion symmetry that allows for a linear gradient energy , @xmath81 , involving linearly @xmath82 ( with the helical axis along the z - direction ) .",
    "one can discriminate left- and right - handed helices because the inverted tetragonal biaxial structure is different from the original one , in particular , what can be called right - handed for the original structure is left - handed for the inverted one and _",
    "vice versa_. obviously , the energetic gain due to the helix does not depend on the handedness and is therefore coined `` ambidextrous '' . in that respect",
    "it is similar to the ambidextrous chirality in the smectic c@xmath31 and c@xmath32 phases , which are however ( structurally ) chiral , in contrast to the d2d phase , where we call this phenomenon ambidextrous helicity , cf . section [ ambi ] .",
    "another peculiar feature of this phase is the orientational frustration in an external electric field .",
    "a nematic director is oriented in an electric field due to the dielectric anisotropy either along the field or perpendicular to it .",
    "the orientation energy is proportional to the square of the field strength . in the t@xmath0",
    "phase the electric orientation effect is cubic in the field strength and orients one of the tetrahedral vectors parallel or antiparallel to the field direction @xcite . in the d2d phase , where the director and the tetrahedral vectors are at an oblique angle @xmath83 with @xmath84",
    ", the nematic and tetrahedral orientation can not be achieved simultaneously . as a result ,",
    "depending on the values of the coupling constants one can obtain _",
    "e.g. _ for small fields the nematic - type of orientation that deviates , however , for higher fields towards the tetrahedral orientation , cf .",
    "section [ external ] .",
    "similar frustration effects occur for the orientation by boundaries , but not for magnetic fields , since the latter do not orient the tetrahedral structure .",
    "we also discuss relative rotations in the d2d phase , where the director and the tetrahedral structure deviate from their equilibrium orientation .",
    "if the relaxation of this variable is slow enough , it can influence the dynamics of the d2d phase , cf .",
    "section [ addrem ] .",
    "if the uniaxial nematic direction @xmath1 along one of the @xmath57 axes of the tetrahedral structure is accompanied by ( orthogonal ) biaxial nematic directions @xmath15 and @xmath16 , phases of even lower symmetry occur . depending on whether the nematic structure is tetragonal or orthorhombic , and on how @xmath15 and @xmath16 are oriented with respect to the tetrahedral vectors ,",
    "non - polar phases of @xmath85 ( s4 ) and @xmath86 ( d2 ) symmetry occur , cf . section [ d2s4 ] , as well as polar ones with @xmath37 ( c2v ) and @xmath39 ( c2 ) symmetry , cf .",

    "phase transitions among various tetrahedral phases are described in @xcite .    in the tetragonal s4 phase",

    "the @xmath57 symmetry axis ( along @xmath1 ) is the only symmetry element left .",
    "its hydrodynamics is rather similar to that of the d2d phase .",
    "the d2 phase is orthorhombic with all nematic directions along one of the @xmath57 tetrahedral directions , section [ d2 ] .",
    "thereby , the three preferred directions are reduced to 2-fold symmetry axes , which are the only symmetry elements left . for the hydrodynamic description",
    "the most important additional feature of the d2 phase ( compared to d2d ) is its chirality , since it only contains proper rotation axes and no mirror planes anymore .",
    "chirality is due to the structure ( and not due to the chirality of molecules ) described by the pseudoscalar @xmath87 with the orthorhombic nematic directors @xmath1 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this gives rise to ambidextrous chirality , since the inverted structure ( with the opposite chirality ) is energetically equivalent and comes in addition to the ambidextrous helicity that is already present in the d2d phase . to make things even more complicated , both effects favor helices about all three 2-fold axes generating strong frustration due to the steric incompatibility of helices about different axes ( similar to the case of biaxial cholesteric lc @xcite ) .",
    "if one orients the orthorhombic directors @xmath15 and @xmath16 within the tetrahedral planes @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( instead of along the @xmath57 axes as in the d2 phase ) one gets the c2v phase , section [ c2v ] , which is polar , but achiral , since the planes @xmath88 and @xmath89 are mirror planes .",
    "the polar axis is the ( former ) @xmath57 axis along @xmath1 , since a flip of that axis can no longer be compensated by a @xmath90 rotation , since @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not equivalent .",

    "it is chiral , since the mirror planes are removed .",
    "it could also be obtained by replacing the tetragonal biaxial nematic structure of a s4 phase by an orthorhombic one .",
    "the hydrodynamics of these polar phases will be discussed together with that of the c3v phase , introduced next .    in the second case of correlated nematic and tetrahedral structure ( with the director along one of the _ tetrahedral _ axes , instead of a @xmath57 axis )",
    "the resulting trigonal biaxial structure is polar .",
    "the preferred polar direction , @xmath91 , is given by the tetrahedral vector along the director .",
    "the hydrodynamics of this c3v phase is rather similar to that of the ( uniaxial ) polar nematic phase @xcite , but has one additional hydrodynamic degree of freedom , the rotation about the polar axis , and a reduced symmetry , @xmath92 ( compared to @xmath93 in polar nematics ) .",
    "this gives rise to a more complicated structure of all rank-3 ( and higher ) material tensors .",
    "a brief discussion of the hydrodynamics is given in section [ c3v ] .",
    "in the case @xmath94 there is no energy that locks a homogeneous nematic and a homogeneous tetrahedral structure ( _ `` homogeneously uncorrelated '' _ ) .",
    "therefore we amend the landau energy ( [ genergy ] ) by ginzburg - type gradient terms @xmath95 the linear gradient term exists because of the broken inversion symmetry of @xmath50 and is not related to chirality .",
    "it allows for inhomogeneous phases having a lower energy than the homogeneous ones . in section [ tnnotcorr ]",
    "we discuss as an example , splay - bend textures of the nematic director accompanied by those of the tetrahedral structure @xcite . in the nematic splay - bend texture the orientation of the director periodically oscillates along an axis in the plane . taking this axis as one of the @xmath57 axes ( and a second one to define the splay - bend plane ) the tetrahedral splay - bend structure ( with the same periodicity )",

    "while the results found were qualitatively in accord with a classical landau picture , it was found that there is a density change at the isotropic - nematic phase transition which is about an order of magnitude smaller than for rod - like molecules .",
    "in addition , the relaxation rate of the isotropic phase fluctuations is slowed down and the viscosity of the orientational fluctuations are an order of magnitude higher .",
    "the picture suggested @xcite is that of clusters of bent - core molecules in the isotropic phase above the nematic phase , a picture which is also consistent with the onset of tetrahedrally coordinated complexes . in @xcite",
    "the immediate vicinity of the nematic - isotropic transition was investigated under high magnetic fields and it was demonstrated that a first order isotropic to nematic phase transition could be induced , an observation unknown from compounds made of rod - like molecules near the isotropic - nematic phase transition in a magnetic field .",
    "it is found that the measured change in phase transition temperature to the nematic phase is found to be considerably larger than what is expected using a landau picture for the orientational oder parameter @xmath65 and the authors suggest that this effect could be associated with the onset of tetrahedral order @xcite . in @xcite measurements of heat capacity , density , magnetic - field",
    "induced birefringence , line width , scattered light intensity , and the viscosity associated with fluctuations of the quadrupolar order parameter @xmath65 have been used to study a larger temperature interval in the vicinity of the nematic - isotropic phase transition in a compound composed of bent - core molecules .",
    "two peaks are observed in the isotopic phase above the nematic phase in heat capacity as well as in density measurements signaling the existence of two optically isotropic phases .",
    "the magnetic field induced birefringence is found to be no longer @xmath630 , but develops a curvature not compatible with a simple landau picture for @xmath65 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite also find that the viscosity associated with the quadrupolar orientational order parameter shows an unusual step change somewhat above the clearing point .",
    "the authors suggest a landau model comprising a quadrupolar orientational order parameter @xmath65 as well as a tetrahedral order parameter @xmath50 . as a result of the landau analysis involving two order parameters",
    "the authors find that they can account for all their experimental results .",
    "this provides the best experimental evidence available to date for the presence of a tetrahedral phase with a completely isotropic phase at higher temperature .    due to the broken inversion symmetry ,",
    "electric field effects are prominent and rather special in tetrahedral phases .",
    "first , for bent - core molecules , phase transitions isotropic - smectic b@xmath406 @xcite and isotropic - smectic c@xmath631 @xcite were studied in an external electric field .",
    "it was found that an upward shift of the phase transition temperature by up to about 10 k could be achieved , which was approximately linear in the applied electric field @xcite . at first sight both ,",
    "the magnitude as well as the linearity of the shift in the applied voltage , come as a surprise since for rod - like molecules large shifts of more than small fractions of a degree in the isotropic - smectic phase transition temperature have never been observed .",
    "even more surprising is the linearity in the applied voltage .",
    "clearly an isotropic phase has no preferred polar direction , which could be oriented and could give rise to a linear response in the electric field .",
    "in addition , quadrupolar orientational order can only generate shifts that are quadratic in the applied electric or magnetic fields as already pointed out by de gennes , when studying the isotropic - nematic transition in low molecular weight liquid crystals @xcite .    as we have discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ tdfields ] , in a ( optically isotropic ) tetrahedral phase the situation is different . here",
    ", transition shifts and induced nematic order occur , which are linear in the field strength , eqs .",
    "( [ lineq ] ) , ( [ inducedq ] ) , ( [ tcshift ] ) , and ( [ scshift ] ) .",
    "this also applies to tetrahedral - smectic transitions , since smectic order is always accompanied by nematic order @xcite .",
    "recently , isotropic - nematic transitions in bent - core material have been studied directly .",
    "electric field effects on this transition are described in ref .",
    "they find a linear field dependence ( their fig .",
    "4 ) , which is fully compatible with the assumption that the `` isotropic '' phase is rather a tetrahedral one . in addition , isotropic to isotropic transitions as well as a reentrant isotropic phase has been described for another family of bent core molecules @xcite . again , the existence of two optically isotropic phases , and the linear response to electric fields in one of them , clearly points to the presence of tetrahedral order .",
    "the electric properties of bent - core nematic phases were also shown to lead to some unusual spatio - temporal patterns in electroconvection @xcite .",
    "the appearance of ambidextrous chiral domains in smectic phases formed of bent - core molecules has been reported quite early @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite the issue of chirality shown by nematic bent - core phases has been examined in detail experimentally , in planar as well as in homeotropic cells .",
    "it was suggested , using molecular modeling , that the nematic phase analyzed is of @xmath86 symmetry @xcite .",
    "we note that for a nematic phase with this symmetry the microscopic @xcite as well as the macroscopic ( sec .",
    "[ d2 ] ) properties have been investigated .",
    "tetrahedral order is crucial for the existence of , and the various chiral effects in @xmath86 symmetric nematic phases .",
    "several unusual smectic and nematic phases have been found in ferrocenomesogens @xcite and linked to tetrahedral order .",
    "the latter is traced back to a tetrahedral association of the molecules . among the macroscopic phenomena arising",
    "are large domains of opposite chirality ( ambidextrous chiral domains ) as well as helical superstructures @xcite .",
    "both are compatible with tetrahedral order , secs .",
    "[ ambi ] and [ d2s4 ] . for heterochiral areas in these compounds",
    "an optically isotropic appearance has been found , again compatible with tetrahedral order .",
    "since the tetrahedral order parameter is of rank 3 , most of the material relations are isotropic , in particular the dielectric tensor denoting the optical behavior ( an exception is the viscosity tensor ) .",
    "therefore it is rather difficult to experimentally discriminate a tetrahedral phase from an isotropic one .",
    "however , there are two principal differences , one with respect to reversible ( deformational ) flows and the other regarding external electric fields",
    ". the former describes flow induced by gradients of temperature , concentration etc .",
    "( and _ vice versa _ ) , impossible in isotropic liquids .",
    "the latter comprise induced nematic order and transition shifts that are linear in the field amplitude , while they have to be quadratic in an isotropic phase .",
    "this only refers to electric fields and not to magnetic ones due to the different parity and time reversal properties of those fields . in the preceding section",
    "we have discussed some experiments regarding the differences between isotropic and tetrahedral phases .",
    "clearly , it would be highly desirable to perform measurements of the electric birefringence in addition to the magnetic birefringence .",
    "the specific tetrahedral effects are due to the spontaneous broken inversion symmetry in these systems : the inverted structure is different from the original one , but energetically equivalent .    when combined with nematic order , depending on the geometric relation between the tetrahedral vectors and the nematic director(s ) , several different liquid crystal phases can arise that are achiral or ( structurally ) chiral , non - polar or polar , in any combination .",
    "rather low symmetries can occur . among those phases the d2d phase is of particular interest , since , there , helical ground states of opposite helicity , but equal energy , are possible ( ambidextrous helicity ) , despite the fact that the phase is achiral .",
    "the reason is the existence of a linear gradient term in the frank - type energy allowed by the tetrahedral order . in a chiral system ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a linear nematic twist allowed due to the existence of a pseudoscalar quantity , whose origin is either due to the chirality of the molecules or comes from the structure of the phase . in the latter case both types of handedness are energetically equal ( ambidextrous chirality ) .",
    "as an example the d2 phase is discussed above .",
    "another specific feature of many tetrahedral nematic phases is the orientational frustration in an electric field , where the nematic dielectric anisotropy and the tetrahedral field orientation are incompatible with the relative orientation of the tetrahedral vectors and the nematic director(s ) .",
    "we have shown in the bulk part of this review that tetrahedral or octupolar order and its consequences have been mainly analyzed in soft matter physics , in particular in the field of liquid crystals .",
    "it is worth pointing out , however , that octupolar order , in particular in two spatial dimensions , has also been used in the study of moving and deformable active particles as models for self - propelled micro - organisms @xcite . in this case",
    "octupolar order comes into play when deformations of lower symmetry going beyond quadrupolar deformations are considered .    from an applied mathematics point of view",
    "it has been demonstrated recently @xcite for two spatial dimensions how the maxima of the associated probability density are connected to a third rank totally symmetric and traceless tensor .",
    "it turns out that such a representation is equivalent to the diagonalization of this third rank tensor in two spatial dimensions .",
    "a suitable generalization of this analysis to three dimensions is clearly desirable for the field of liquid crystals .    in this review",
    "we have restricted ourselves to phases with tetrahedral order , either alone or together with ( uniaxial and biaxial ) nematic order",
    ". often , bent - core molecules form smectic phases and one can expect that tetrahedral order also plays a role there . however , many of those phases , _ e.g. _ those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , and those relevant for applications , are polar .",
    "the existence of polarity has a strong influence on the structure of the macroscopic dynamics of such phases and an additional tetrahedral order does not lead to important new effects . on the other hand , for the non - polar smectic phases made of bent - core material , smectic c , c@xmath632 , and c@xmath633 @xcite , the tetrahedral order provides new additional aspects @xcite .",
    "the same is true for gels and elastomers with tetrahedral order .",
    "an example is presented already in this review in eq .",
    "( [ piezo ] ) , where an electric field induces a strain field ( linear in the field strength ) in the presence of tetrahedral order .",
    "tetrahedral elastic effects may also be able to explain some of the experimental findings in agglomerating bent - core systems @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic theory presented here is based on the presence or lack of symmetries on the macroscopic level ( in addition to certain general conservation laws and thermodynamic rules ) .",
    "the way molecules arrange on the microscopic level is not considered , since it is not necessary to do so for macroscopic properties .",
    "the only exception is fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] in sec .",
    "[ chiralt ] , which is an example of how to distribute chiral centers on the bent - core molecules in order to get chirality on the macroscopic level .",
    "it is meant to be a rather simple molecular picture . often ,",
    "_ e.g. _ in refs .",
    "@xcite , tetrahedral order is related to the appearance of tetrahedral clusters or agglomerations of many bent - core molecules .",
    "such a picture is in complete accordance with our description , where only the existence of tetrahedral order , but not its molecular realization is important ."
