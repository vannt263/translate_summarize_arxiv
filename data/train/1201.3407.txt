    "supermassive black hole binaries ( smbhbs ) are predicted by the hierarchical galaxy formation model in @xmath4 cold dark matter ( @xmath4cdm ) cosmology @xcite . for merging galaxies , their two smbhs with galactic cores",
    "will firstly approach each other by dynamical friction , and then get close enough to form a bound , compact binary system .",
    "after that , the smbhb may stall at a so called `` hard binary separation '' for a time even longer than the hubble time @xcite .",
    "however , recent investigations suggest that the hardening rates of smbhbs can be boosted and they may coalesce within the hubble time either due to various stellar dynamical processes other than spherical two - body relaxation @xcite , or gas dynamics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since the evolution of smbhbs deeply impacts the evolution of host galaxies , it is very important for us to find observational evidences to constrain evolution models of smbhbs .",
    "a statistic way is the calculation of tidal disruption rates .",
    "a dormant smbh could be temporarily activated by tidally disrupting a star passing by and accreting the disrupted stellar debris @xcite , which may have been observed in several non - active galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite calculated the tidal disruption rate in smbhb systems at different evolutionary stages , and found that is significantly different from the typical rate in a single smbh for several orders of magnitude .    the most certain proof for detecting smbhb individually may come from gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation observation .",
    "coalescing smbhbs are important sources of gw radiation @xcite , and can be detected within the next decades by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) and the pulsar timing array ( pta ) program @xcite . because of the poor spatial resolution of both lisa and pta for locating gw radiation sources , it is of key importance to detect electromagnetic counterparts ( emcs ) of gw radiation sources . besides , identifying smbhbs by their emcs is also essential to constrain the poorly understood galaxy - merger history .",
    "several emcs have been suggested in the literature to probe smbhbs , ( 1 ) precession of jet orientation and its acceleration in radio galaxies during the in - spiraling of smbhbs @xcite , ( 2 ) optical periodic outbursts in blazars due to the interaction of smbhbs and accretion disk @xcite , ( 3 ) jet reorientation in x - shaped radio galaxies due to the exchange of angular momentum between smbhbs and accretion disk @xcite , ( 4 ) interruption of tidal disruption flares in smbhbs systems @xcite .",
    "besides , there are also some emcs to probe the coalescence of smbhbs and its remnant , ( 1 ) intermittent activity in double - double radio galaxies at binary coalescence @xcite , ( 2 ) x - ray , uv , optical , and ir afterglow following binary coalescence @xcite , ( 3 ) systematically shifted broad emission lines relative to narrow emission lines @xcite and off - center active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite because of smbh gw radiation recoil , ( 4)tidal disruption flares and hypercompact stellar systems for recoiling black holes @xcite .",
    "the breakthrough on numerical relativity in the past few years reveals the final stage of smbhb s coalescence @xcite .",
    "the coalescence remnant smbh can be recoiled due to the anisotropically gw emission during the inspiral and final coalescence @xcite . for nonspinning smbhs ,",
    "the recoil velocity is @xmath5 @xcite , which is just as the same order of magnitude as the stellar dispersion velocity in the galactic center . however , if both of two smbhs are rapidly spinning , the recoil velocity can be as large as thousands kilometers per second .",
    "this recoil velocity depends sensitively on the intersection angle between spin vectors of two smbhs and their linear momenta . for some extreme cases , with maximally spinning equal - mass smbhs and",
    "antialigned spins in orbital plane , the recoiling velocity can achieve to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a recoiling smbh with high velocity has significant displacement relative to the galactic center . for most of massive galaxies with escape velocity @xmath7 @xcite",
    ", the recoiling smbh has opportunity to escape from its host galaxy . those recoiling smbhs which are still bound to",
    "host galaxies will oscillate around the galactic centers and change the core density profiles of the host galaxies due to dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "in addition , the recoiling smbh with a fraction of its accretion disk can produce sets of emission lines separated by relative velocity @xcite or off - center active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite .    in gas poor environment ,",
    "a recoiling smbh might be observed as a `` hypercompact stellar system '' ( hcss ) . that is a kind of star cluster which is bound to the recoiling smbh , with similar luminosity as a globular cluster or ultracompact dwarf galaxy , and very high velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the other signature is an offset tidal flare due to the recoiling smbh tidally disrupting surrounding stars . @xcite",
    "have used both analysis and @xmath1-body simulations to calculate the tidal disruption rates of the recoiling smbh for bound and unbound stars .",
    "they found that the tidal disruption rates , in most cases , are smaller than in stationary systems .",
    "recently , @xcite have investigated the bound stellar density profile and tidal disruption evolution around the recoiling smbh .",
    "they found that the tidal disruption rate will monotonically fall as a power - law after the recoil .",
    "there is also an analytical work focusing on the tidal disruption rate during a short period just after coalescence @xcite , which predicts multiple tidal disruption flares in few years or decades after the coalescence .",
    "most of the above works about tidal disruption of the recoiling smbh have focused on theoretical analysis and neglected the impact of background stars . since the real evolution process in such kind of system is very complex , a detailed study on the recoiling smbh co - evolving with the galactic center is essential . unlike previous work , we evolve the entire system before and after the recoil with unbound stars included .",
    "our work focuses on investigating the co - evolution between the recoiling smbh and surrounding stars with tidal disruption and accretion processes . to it",
    "come true , we use a special high - accuracy , parallel direct @xmath1-body code accelerated by many - core hardware ( @xmath8-grape and @xmath8-gpu ) @xcite , including a simplified tidal disruption scheme @xcite .",
    "most of our simulations are calculated on the @xmath9 gpu cluster in national astronomical observatories of china ( naoc ) . with up to million of particles in simulation",
    ", we can find out the dynamical evolution of stars near the recoiling smbhs and estimate their tidal disruption rates , which may give us some hints for observation .",
    "our results show that the accretion of disrupted stars does not significantly impact the dynamical evolution of recoiling smbh . however , it changes the tidal disruption rate compared to a stationary smbh system in a galactic center .",
    "most of tidal disruption events are contributed by unbound stars when the smbh passing through the galactic center , and the disruption rate in average is @xmath2 , which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the stationary case , @xmath10 . besides , the tidal disruption rate for oscillating smbh far from the galactic center is roughly one or two orders of magnitude lower than stationary smbh .",
    "we also find a bound stellar system around the recoiling smbh with a mass of @xmath3 black hole mass , which is consistent with @xcite . except for bound stellar systems ,",
    "we find that there is a  polarization cloud \" composed of stars dynamically perturbed by the oscillating smbh . this  polarization cloud \" is axisymmetrically diffuse in a large spatial area which is beyond the gravitational influence region of the oscillating smbh .",
    "for this reason , most of the stars in the cloud are not permanently bound to the smbh .",
    "this kind of clouds are the echo of dynamical friction .",
    "the calculations for parameter dependence show that the variation of initial mass of the recoiling smbh can speed up or slow down the dynamical evolution , and impact the tidal disruption rate .",
    "in addition , the variation of density slope can obviously change the dynamical evolution and tidal disruption rate of the recoiling smbh .",
    "we give our galactic model and simulation method in section [ method ] .",

    "we do not consider the growth of @xmath41 for accreting smbh or the momentum transfer from tidal disrupted stars to the recoiling smbh , because the total mass of disrupted stars is negligible compared to the bh .",
    "a test simulation taking into account momentum transfer shows no significant difference in either the dynamical evolution of recoiling smbh or the stellar disruption rate .      to investigate the evolution of the recoiling smbh with tidal disruption carefully",

    "there is also a calculation with @xmath49 to check the dependency on @xmath22 .",
    "as mentioned before , for the purposes of extrapolating to the smaller tidal radius in the real galactic center conditions , we have varied the @xmath43 from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , which is roughly corresponding to @xmath52 to @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "since the density slope prior to the recoil is under debate , we choose @xmath54 as our fiducial value , and also investigate other cases with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the recoil velocity @xmath57 is set to @xmath58 for most of the integrations , and there are calculations without recoiling velocity for comparison . besides , an integration with @xmath59 and @xmath55 is included for comparing with @xcite .",
    "since dehnen model provides the stellar distribution in a galaxy without central smbh , we have to first to set up consistent initial conditions for our system . at first",
    ", we put a smbh into the center of a stellar system with dehnen profile , and evolve the entire system for 50 simulation time units to relax the core region .",
    "after that the system is dynamically and thermally relaxed in relation to the smbh gravitational potential . at this stage , we do not consider stellar tidal disruption process .",
    "however , we want to make sure that stars inside the tidal disruption loss cone of the central smbh have already been removed by tidal accretion before the recoil of smbh . therefore , as a second step",
    ", we switch on the tidal disruption scheme in the program and run it again with the smbh still in equilibrium in the center - this costs a few dynamical timescales at the influence radius .",
    "thus all particles within the tidal disruption loss cone can be removed before we apply a kick to the smbh . after setting up the initial configuration of the stellar distribution of the systems",
    ", we artificially give a recoil velocity to the smbh and follow its dynamical evolution .",
    "to carefully investigate the dynamical evolution of recoiling smbh , we have a long time integration with model @xmath60 to @xmath61 , as shown in figure  [ fig : osc ] .",
    "it is clear that the evolution of the recoiling smbh can be easily divided into two different phases . the phase i has obviously damping trajectory from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "after that , the smbh evolves into phase ii , where the trajectory damped very slow for a long time . in phase",
    "i , the trajectory of recoiling smbh can be well predicted by chandrasekhar s dynamical friction theory @xcite .",
    "however , this stage will just keep till the smbh s oscillation decayed to the size of core , where a slowly decayed phase ii begins .",
    "that is because the stellar mass interior to smbh s orbit is roughly equal to @xmath22 at the end of phase i , where the assumptions of chandrasekhar s dynamical friction theory are invalid .",
    "we have tried to fit the trajectory analytically in phase i with the same method as @xcite used , and got a similar result even though a dehnen model is adopted here instead of their core - srsic model .",
    "if we continue the integration , the orbital oscillation of the smbh will slowly decay and finally achieve to a thermal equilibrium with surrounding stars , which is the so - called phase iii in @xcite .",
    "here we have not continue our integrations into that stage because phase iii is actually similar to the case of a stationary central smbh , which is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "we will just focus on phase i and phase ii in the following integrations .",
    "thus all of our models integrate to @xmath64 in order to make sure that the evolution can achieve to phase ii .    with regard to the orbital motion of the smbh",
    ", our results agree qualitatively well with those of @xcite .",
    "that is because the growth of the black hole due to tidal accretion , which did not take into account in @xcite , is relatively small .",
    "a recoiling smbh can carry a retinue of bound stars .",
    "@xcite predict that there will be a  hypercompact stellar system \" ( hcss ) bound to the recoiling smbh .",
    "we can analytically estimate the bound population of the hcss with equations ( 1a ) and ( 6a ) in @xcite .",
    "for example , the roughly boundary radius @xmath65 of hcss should be    @xmath66    with our model @xmath60 , where @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 in our simulation unit . thus we can define a factor @xmath69 to describe the fraction of bound stars ,    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is total mass of bound stars . based on equations  ( [ eq : rej ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : rinfd ] ) , we have @xmath72 . for the case of @xmath54 , with @xmath73 in figure 1a of @xcite , we have @xmath74 .",
    "that means the ratio for hcss mass to @xmath22 should be @xmath75 , corresponding to just few particles for @xmath76 simulation .",
    "it should be aware that this fraction is just a lower limit because our  two times @xmath22 \" assumption actually overestimate @xmath23 . to confirm the conclusion above",
    ", we investigate this problem with @xmath1-body simulations .    in the simulation",
    ", it is very difficult to distinguish whether a star is bound to smbh or not .",
    "that is because most of star particles with negative total energies relative to the smbh are loosely bound .",
    "only few of them could orbit the smbh for more than one orbital period .",
    "for this reason , we identify a star to be bound to the recoiling smbh if following two criteria are both satisfied : the particle ( 1 ) has negative total energy relative to the smbh and ( 2 ) remains bound for at least one orbital oscillation period of the recoiling smbh .",
    "we find that most of the  bound \" particles around smbh particle will be evaporated before the end of simulation .",
    "this effect is more significant for our escaping smbh calculation with model 10 , where the number of bound particles decreases monotonically . for other oscillating smbh calculations , there are many unbound particles can be captured by the smbh .",
    "that means the interaction between the hcss and stellar background is very important .    figure  [ fig : realbd ] shows the evolution of bound stars around a recoiling smbh in model @xmath60 . at @xmath62 , when @xmath77 , there are five bound particles , roughly consistent with the estimation from equation  ( [ eq : fb ] ) .",
    "the number of bound particles , @xmath78 , slightly increases during the evolution from phase i to phase ii .",
    "because in phase ii ( 1 ) the low relative velocity between stars and the recoiling smbh increases the probability of dynamical capture and ( 2 ) the stellar density around the smbh in phase ii is higher .",
    "our results suggest that a hcss may grow via capturing unbound single stars .",
    "however , the low particle resolution and large statistical error prevent us from further investigation of the growth of hcss .",
    "the hcss may be detected as an off - nuclear compact system of similar size and stellar mass of a globular clusters but of having very high internal velocities @xcite .",
    "however , that is not the whole story .",
    "as shown in the figures  [ fig : traceapo ] and  [ fig : trace ] , we find that there is a stellar cloud composed of stars which are strongly impacted by the recoiling smbh at the first apocenter .",
    "the total mass of this cloud is comparable to @xmath22 .",
    "they form a quasi - axisymmetric stellar cloud and always have a dense region around smbh .",
    "this kind of clouds gives an evidence for the echo of dynamical friction .",
    "for this reason , we name that stellar cloud as  polarization cloud \" . in our simulation of model 06 , we choose a time snapshot when the smbh arrives at its first apocenter , and pick up those polarization cloud members from the @xmath79 phase space which includes all of star particles .",
    "all of polarization cloud members in the @xmath79 phase space are outliers around smbh particle and can be easily distinguished .",
    "thus we can collect those polarization cloud particles and trace their evolution .",
    "however , it is very difficult to find an automatical solution to efficiently distinguish those polarization cloud members for every time snapshot . to deeply investigate this kind of polarization clouds , an efficient method to extract those outlier particles",
    "is needed .",
    "this problem should be solved in our following work .    in figure",
    "[ fig : traceapo ] , we plot that polarization cloud at time @xmath80 , when the recoiling smbh arrives at its first apocenter .",
    "all the parameters here are obtained from model @xmath60 . in order to investigate the origin and evolution of those cloud members ,",
    "we look back the data and follow the evolution of the stars from time @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ fig : trace ] gives the evolution of those stars and the recoiling smbh from @xmath62 until @xmath81 , when our computation stopped .",
    "the snapshots with @xmath82 in figure  [ fig : trace ] show the evolutions of the cloud members from beginning toward the first apocenter of the recoiling smbh .",
    "the following three snapshots correspond to the time when the recoiling smbh comes back from the first apocenter and passes through the density center for the second time .",
    "the snapshot at @xmath83 shows the smbh passing through galactic center for the third time , and the last snapshot is for the end of computation .",
    "our calculation results and figure  [ fig : trace ] imply that the shape of polarization cloud varies with the oscillations of the recoiling smbh .",
    "the comparison between the first and the last two panels vividly shows the changes of the cloud members during the oscillation .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : realbd ] , there are only small fraction of stars really bound to the smbh , whereas the mass of the polarization cloud is roughly equal to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore most of these cloud members are unbound to the recoiling smbh .",
    "after the recoil of smbh , those polarization cloud members are accelerated and fall behind the oscillating smbh . during the oscillation , some of the stars gradually expand to larger area while others continuously follow the smbh to oscillate around the galactic center , and form an axisymmetrical distribution along the velocity direction of the recoiling smbh .",
    "after multiple interactions with oscillating smbh , these stars obtain energy from oscillating smbh and diffuse to a large area .",
    "this is a vivid example that an oscillating smbh transfer its orbital energy to surround stars through dynamical friction .    in order to investigate the observational properties of this polarization cloud , we focus on its most compact stage , when the recoiling smbh arrive at the apocenter for the first time .",
    "the distribution of those stars are shown in figure  [ fig : traceapo ] . here",
    "we scale the @xmath1-body system to our physical fiducial galaxy model with stellar mass @xmath84 and half mass radius @xmath30 . for such system ,",
    "the polarization cloud has mass of @xmath85 , and a size of diameter @xmath86 .",
    "further calculation shows that , its half mass radius is @xmath87 .",
    "this size and mass are much larger than a globular cluster and comparable to an ultracompact dwarf galaxy .",
    "we also calculate the velocity dispersion of this polarization cloud .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion along x , y and z axes are @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 individually .",
    "that is significantly higher than a typical ultracompact dwarf galaxy . comparing with bound hcss",
    ", this polarization cloud has larger size , heavier mass and similar velocity dispersion .",
    "since this cloud is mixed with hcss , it may bring troubles to the detection of hcss .",
    "we also estimate the average surface density inside the half mass radius of the polarization cloud .",
    "the overdensity of the polarization cloud relative to the stellar background is only @xmath91 4% .",
    "this may be because of that the apocenter of the recoiling smbh here is not very far from the galactic center , where the surface density of the stellar background is still relatively high in model 06 with @xmath54 . for a smbh with a higher recoil velocity and a larger apocenter",
    ", the situation may be improved . to investigate this problem ,",
    "more simulations are needed .",
    "we will investigate this problem in our future work .",
    "it should be noted that our example above is just for one time snapshot of the evolving smbh .",
    "every snapshot could have a similar stellar cloud .",
    "the composition of these clouds may form an interesting structure which can trace the trajectory of the smbh .",
    "the evolution and observation characters of this kind of structures will be discussed in our future work . for a recoiling smbh with highly enough velocity to escape from the galaxy ,",
    "that kind of polarization cloud may not be distinguishable because many stars will be dropped behind the escaping smbh . without the multiple interactions between oscillating smbh and surrounding stars ,",
    "the polarization cloud can not survive for a long time .        for a solar type star disrupted by a smbh with mass @xmath92 , based on equation  ( [ eq : rt ] ) and ( [ eq : scalingr ] ) ,",
    "the tidal radius is @xmath93 , corresponding to @xmath94 in simulation units with our fiducial model . as mentioned in section [ gala model ] , because of the limitation on particle resolution , it is practically impossible with present computing capabilities to calculate the tidal disruption rate directly ( with a realistically small tidal radius ) through direct @xmath1-body simulations .    to solve this problem , we perform a parameterized study , which treats both the particle number @xmath1 and the size of the tidal disruption radius @xmath41 as free parameters .",
    "all of the simulations have been done with these varying parameters , and physical conclusions are drawn from extrapolating to the real galactic conditions . @xcite",
    "have shown in fokker - planck models that such scaling is reliable and provides physically correct results .",
    "besides , tidal disruption events in our simulations , as well as the case in real galactic center , do not occur frequently , which means that the increase of @xmath22 is discrete .",
    "thus it is difficult to compute the tidal disruption rate through calculating accreted masses in time bins .",
    "instead , we measure the tidal disruption rate in a cumulative , averaged way - fitting the mass growth of the black hole and derive its time derivative .    in order to find out the extrapolation relation , the dependence of tidal disruption rate on particle numbers and tidal radius should be investigated .",
    "figure  [ fig : tdnrt ] shows the disruption rates changes with different @xmath1 and @xmath41 , with parameters are @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath54 , @xmath46 and @xmath77 .",
    "the left panel shows that the dependence of averaged tidal disruption rates on @xmath1 and @xmath41 .",
    "here we calculate the averaged disruption rates for phase i , phase ii and entire process separately with different @xmath1 and @xmath41 .",
    "these integrations show that the dependence of tidal disruption rate on particle number is very weak .",

    "based on the loss cone feeding theory @xcite , contrary to empty loss cone case , the tidal disruption rate for full loss cone does not depend on @xmath1 .",
    "it should be notice that the tidal disruption rate here is for mass disruption rate , and the disrupted particles indeed depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the slight different average rates between @xmath76 and @xmath48 cases means that the loss cones in our integrations are nearly full and the changes of particle numbers do not bring significant impact .",
    "opposed to particle numbers , the changes on @xmath41 strongly influence the disruption rates .",
    "a detailed study is in the right panel of figure  [ fig : tdnrt ] , which shows the evolution of disruption rate - @xmath41 dependence for several special points with integrations for @xmath97 .",

    "our results show that the disruption rates increase for every @xmath41 value during the evolution of the recoiling smbh .",
    "that is because a decayed orbit of smbh leads to a growing stellar background around it .",
    "besides , the similar linear disruption rate - @xmath41 relation as left panel has been found . however , the relation here for the first four snapshots are not as good as the average results in the left panel .",
    "that may because our particle resolution for small @xmath41 is not good enough in phase i.    based on our result data , it seems that there is an approximate linear relation between @xmath41 and disruption rates . as a result of full loss cone condition",
    ", the disruption rates will be proportional to cross section @xmath98 and density @xmath99 near the recoiling smbh ,    s(r ) _ rela , [ eq : tdr ] where @xmath100 is average relative velocity between the recoiling smbh and the surrounding stars .",
    "it is difficult for us to analytically derive stellar distribution around a recoiling smbh .",
    "however , the cross section can be wrote as    sr_t^2(1 + ) , [ eq : cs ] which can write the tidal disruption rate as    r_t^2(r ) _ rela(1 + ) .",
    "[ eq : mdot ] for @xmath101 that is @xmath102 ( even if one takes into account that @xmath103 contains a contribution from the smbh kick velocity ) , so we are in the gravitational focusing regime , where    sr_t .",
    "[ eq : csp ] thus we have    ( r)r_t .",
    "[ eq : mdotsimp ]    if @xmath104 and @xmath100 are constant with time , the tidal accretion rate will scale linearly with @xmath41 .",
    "this relation is clearly only correct in a time averaged sense , because when the smbh oscillating in the galaxy , all quantities will be strongly changed within a single orbit ( density , stellar velocity dispersion and smbh velocity , the two latter quantities determining @xmath100 ) . however , in a running time averaged over several orbits , our results show that there is not a large variation in these quantities .",
    "so we can define a dimensionless tidal accretion parameter @xmath105 by the following relation :    t_dyn = .",
    "[ eq : alpha ] here @xmath106 is the dynamic time scale around the position of the recoiling smbh .",
    "our simulations imply that across all of our model families @xmath105 does not depend strongly on @xmath1 or @xmath41 , but only on the evolutionary phase .",
    "thus @xmath105 can be used in extrapolations to the real system with very small @xmath41 and large @xmath1 .",
    "based on the analysis above , though it is complicated to get an accurate scaling relation , we still can estimate the tidal disruption rate through linear extrapolation of tidal radius .      for comparison purposes ,",
    "we calculate the tidal disruption rate of a stationary smbh without recoil in the galactic center .",
    "a series of simulations with different @xmath41 values are carried out .",
    "figure  [ fig : tdr ] shows the static disruption rate for @xmath96 , corresponding to model @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively . as mentioned in section [ calc num ] , the tidal radius for our fiducial model is @xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath94 in our simulation units .",
    "our simulation results with different particle numbers for stationary case show that the tidal disruption rates weakly depend on the particle numbers .",
    "thus we can loosely accept a full loss cone condition for the stationary case .",
    "as discussed in section [ calc num ] , there is a roughly linear correlation between tidal disruption rate and @xmath41 for full loss cone case .",
    "based on equation  ( [ eq : mdotsimp ] ) , we can extrapolate our simulation results to the real galaxy conditions with smaller tidal radii .",
    "figure  [ fig : tdr ] shows that the tidal disruption rate for @xmath112 is @xmath113 in our simulation units . that can be extrapolated to @xmath114 , and gives us the tidal disruption rate @xmath115 , which corresponds to the order of magnitude @xmath10 for our fiducial model .      in a recoiling smbh system , there are two populations of stars contributed to the tidal disruption rate .",
    "one is the bound stars around the smbh , and the other is those unbound stars encountered with the recoiling smbh . if the bound stars dominate , as demonstrated in @xcite for an escaping smbh , the tidal disruption rate should roughly keep a constant level at the beginning , and finally drop down because of the consumption of bound stars . on the contrary , if the tidal disruption rate is dominated by unbound stars , the results will depend on stellar density , relative velocity of smbh , and the size of tidal radius , which described by equation  ( [ eq : mdot ] ) .",
    "if we just consider about the contribution of the unbound stars , for an oscillating smbh , its tidal disruption rate near the galactic center should be higher than the apocenter region because of the different stellar density .",
    "however , @xmath100 can also change the result .",
    "for instance , we have an estimation in our model @xmath116 with @xmath117 , @xmath54 , @xmath46 and @xmath118 .",
    "our simulation result shows that the first apocenter of the recoiling smbh is around @xmath119 . with the assumptions that @xmath120 and @xmath121",
    ", we can estimate the disruption rate ratio from the galactic center to the first apocenter region . by substituted into equations  ( [ dehnen rho ] ) and ( [ eq : mdot ] ) ,",
    "that ratio is @xmath122 . when scaling to the real galactic center conditions with @xmath114 , it should be @xmath123 .",
    "moreover , this ratio also depends on @xmath100 . if @xmath100 near apocenters can be larger than @xmath124 , that ratio may be higher .",
    "unfortunately , we can not obtain an accurate value for @xmath100 . for estimation",
    ", it can be seen that the tidal disruption rates near the galactic center are several times or even an order of magnitude higher than the apocenter region .",
    "that conclusion is confirmed by our simulation results .",
    "figure  [ fig : tde ] gives the distribution of the tidal disruption events count @xmath125 relative to distance @xmath19 in model @xmath116 .",
    "it shows that most of the tidal disruption events appear around the density center , which indicates a boosted tidal disruption rate when the oscillating smbh pass through the galactic center .",
    "a smbh around the apocenter with a nearly zero velocity always corresponds to a low @xmath100 , which should give us a high disruption rate .",
    "however , as equation  ( [ eq : mdot ] ) shown , the low stellar density environment makes the tidal disruption events less than at galactic center .",
    "the higher disruption rate near the galactic center means that , for an oscillating smbh , most of tidal disruption events are contributed by unbound stars . for this reason ,",
    "unbound stars are very important for calculating tidal disruption rate .",
    "figure  [ fig : tdrk ] shows the tidal disruption rates for a recoiling smbh with different @xmath126 , which belong to model @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively . to increase the accuracy of our fitting results for disruption rate in phase i and phase ii",
    ", we neglect the transition boundary between the two phases in the fitting .",
    "therefore , we fit disruption rate for phase i and phase ii separately . as a result , the fitted results are not continuous between two phases .",
    "the left part of figure  [ fig : tdrk ] shows that the tidal disruption rates in phase i are linearly increasing . for different @xmath41 values , there is also a similar linear relation to stationary smbh case , even though there is an increasing tidal disruption rate instead of a constant value . here the calculation with model @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) is not included because the particle resolution is too low to estimate disruption rate . with the same extrapolating relation described in section  [ calc num ]",
    ", we estimate that the averaged tidal disruption rate for phase i should around the order of magnitude @xmath2 , which is about an order of magnitude lower than stationary smbh in the galactic center .    for the phase ii , when the orbit of the recoiling smbh damped to relative small region , the variations of stellar density and velocity of smbh are smaller than phase i. thus the difference of disruption rate between apocenters and galactic center is not so intensive .",
    "since the tidal disruption events during entire phase i are few in our simulation , the accuracy for calculating tidal disruption rate is not very good .",
    "however , there are plenty of tidal disruption events in phase ii , which provides a better accuracy to calculate the tidal disruption rate in phase ii . actually , as shown in the right part of figure  [ fig : tdrk ] , there are constant disruption rates as similar as the stationary case . that is because ( 1 ) the stellar densities around smbhs in phase ii and in the stationary smbh case are similar and ( 2 ) their loss cones are both full .",
    "since @xmath76 particles do not have enough high resolution to represent a real galaxy , it is important for us to find out the dependence of our results on the particle number . only with this",
    "considered , the direct @xmath1-body simulation results for dynamical properties of the recoiling smbhs and surrounding stars can be extrapolated to real conditions in galactic nuclei . to bring this forth ,",

    "limited by the particle resolution , we can not obtain good enough mass evolution data to fit the disruption rates in phase i both for @xmath47 and @xmath48 integrations with model @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the only thing can be done is to calculate average tidal disruption rates for phase i and ii , as discussed in section  [ td ] with figure  [ fig : tdnrt ] .",
    "however , those problems do not exist for all of @xmath76 integrations and other @xmath48 integrations . for this reason ,",
    "most of our calculations adopt @xmath76 particles .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : tdnrt ] , the difference of average disruption rates between @xmath48 and @xmath76 is very small , which also indicates that the loss cones are nearly full .    with @xmath76 particles simulation ,",
    "the mass ratio of smbh to stars should be @xmath133 .",
    "this ratio is smaller than the real galaxy condition which should be @xmath134 .",
    "the small mass ratio between smbh and stars may lead to a higher brownian velocity comparing with real galaxy condition @xcite .",
    "however , most of our simulations are terminated before phase iii , which makes the amplitude of oscillating smbh is greater than brownian amplitude .",
    "detailed discussion in @xcite with series of calculations for different particle numbers shows that the particle mass can not significantly impact the dynamical evolution for both phase i and ii .",
    "the limitation of particle number can also influnece the relaxation time @xmath135 . for a homogenous isotropic distribution with equal - mass stars ,",
    "the two - body relaxation time in our simulation units is @xcite t_r(r ) = , [ eq : tr ] where @xmath136 is coulomb logarithm and we can estimate it as = . [ eq : cl ]    when @xmath1 is large enough , for instance @xmath137 , the relaxation time will be roughly proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "it means that our @xmath1-body simulation with @xmath76 particles always give us a shorter relaxation time comparing with real galaxy condition .",
    "this fast relaxation in @xmath1-body simulation may bring troubles to our results .",
    "if the core region in our simulation has relaxed before the recoiling smbh return , our results will departure from the real galaxy condition , because the relaxation time in a real galactic core is always very long .    to solve this problem",

    "based on equation  ( [ eq : scalingv ] ) , @xmath145 corresponds to @xmath146 , which is smaller than most of the galactic center cases .",
    "thus we can conclude that the core region can not relax before the recoiling smbh return both for simulation and real galaxy condition .",
    "the limitation of particle number in @xmath1-body simulation may also impacts the results for the stationary smbh . in recoil case",
    ", the oscillating smbh always corresponds to the full loss cone status both for the simulation and the real galaxy condition . for a stationary smbh",
    ", things will be different .",
    "both the analytical calculations and the numerical simulations for long term evolution of tidal disruption from stationary smbh show that the loss cone in real galaxy is empty for most of the cases @xcite .",

    ", the loss cone could be roughly full .",
    "this prediction has been confirmed by our simulation results .    based on discussions above",

    ", the dynamical friction time scale is inversely proportional to the mass of the recoiling smbh .",
    "for this reason , a heavier smbh should has shorter evolution time scale in phase i. in order to investigate the dependence of evolution time scale on black hole mass @xmath22 , we run a test model @xmath148 with @xmath149 . comparing with model @xmath60 , we find that model @xmath148 gives a shorter oscillation period in phase i , which is roughly two times smaller than that in model @xmath60 .",
    "that is consistent with the prediction of dynamical friction theory . besides , the tidal disruption rate in model @xmath148 is roughly two times higher than that in model @xmath60 for both of the two phases , which is roughly consistent with equation  ( [ eq : mdotsimp ] ) . for a galaxy with lighter smbh ,",
    "which has @xmath150 , there will be a longer dynamical evolution time in phase i and smaller tidal disruption rate comparing with our results above .",
    "limited by the calculation capability , simulations with the lower mass smbh will cost so much time that we can not investigate them carefully .",
    "we note that in the simulations with very large tidal radius , for example , @xmath151 in model @xmath152 and @xmath153 , rapid increase on @xmath22 lead to the declined disruption rates .",
    "this significant growth of @xmath22 is artificial , which makes the declination of disruption rate is unphysical .",
    "when considering different density slopes , the results are quite different .",
    "the higher of @xmath13 value is , the faster of the system evolved .",
    "our integration with model @xmath154 shows that the recoiling smbh will enter phase ii around @xmath155 , which is more faster than evolution of smbh in model @xmath60 with @xmath156 .",
    "thus our models for @xmath55 and @xmath56 actually reach phase iii at the end of integration .",
    "that can be easily understood because a larger @xmath13 means a denser cusp in the galactic center .",

    "the results in the right panel are phase ii for model @xmath60 and phase iii for model @xmath158 and @xmath154 .",
    "it can be seen that , for both panels , there are several times differences between every two adjacent @xmath13 values .    in order to compare with the work in the literature with higher @xmath159 , a simulation with similar initial parameters comparing with model @xmath60 has been done in model @xmath160 , where @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "our result shows that there are just five particles tidally disrupted at the beginning of recoil , and following with zero event recorded for the rest of time .",
    "because of the low particle resolution , we can only give a lower limit to the tidal disruption rate .",
    "for a galaxy with mass @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , the kick velocity should be @xmath166 .",
    "thus our lower limit for tidal disruption rate is @xmath167 , which is lower than @xmath168 in figure @xmath169 of @xcite with similar conditions . for the bound stars",
    ", we find that there are only @xmath170 stars still bound to smbh after the recoil , which is roughly as the same order of magnitude as the result in @xcite .",

    "a series of simulations with larger particle numbers are needed .",

    "it is the first numerical investigation for the evolution of the tidal disruption by an oscillating smbhs with unbound stars included .",
    "moreover , we discover a polarization cloud of stars surrounding the oscillating smbhs , which is not mentioned in the literature .    as argured by @xcite , the dynamical evolution of the recoiling smbh",
    "can be divided into three phases . during the phase",
    "i , the trajectory of the recoiling smbh can be well predicted by chandrasekhar s dynamical friction theory @xcite .",
    "the phase ii begins when the smbh s oscillation decayed to the size of galactic core , and the motion of the smbh damps slowly . at phase iii ,",
    "the orbital oscillation of smbh slowly decay to achieve a thermal equilibrium with surrounding stars . in our simulation , we obtain similar phase i and ii as @xcite have got . besides , our results show that the mass fraction of bound stars relative to smbh is roughly @xmath171 at the beginning .",
    "this value is consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to following the dynamical evolution of the recoiling smbh , we estimate the stellar tidal disruption rates by the recoiling smbhs using direct @xmath1-body simulation together with our simple tidal disruption scheme .",
    "our results show that the stellar tidal disruptions do not significantly change the dynamical evolution of the recoiling smbh .",
    "the stellar disruption rate by the recoiling smbh in phase ii is @xmath10 , which is about the same order of magnitude of the stellar disruption rate by the stationary smbh at a spherical galactic center .",
    "however , in phase i , the stellar tidal disruption rate is about an order of magnitude lower .    in our simulation ,",
    "a spherical stellar distribution is assumed .",
    "this simplified model is not accurate to represent a real galaxy . for most of real bulges / ellipticals ,",
    "their stellar distributions are non - spherical .",
    "as argued by @xcite , the orbital decay time scales of the recoiling smbhs are prolonged in triaxial galaxies comparing with spherical galaxies .",
    "that is because most of the recoiling smbhs in triaxial galaxies can not return directly to their galactic centers , where the influences of dynamical friction are the strongest .",
    "for the same reason , a non - spherical dark matter halo can also significantly increase the decay time of a recoiling smbh @xcite .",
    "since most of the tidal disruption events happened during the smbhs passing through the galactic centers , the triaxiality may significantly reduce the tidal disruption rate from unbound stars . to investigate the impacts of triaxiality , a good solution is to have series of simulations with triaxial stellar distributions .",
    "however , it is very complicated to generate a stationary triaxial distribution for @xmath1-body simulation , and the prolonged orbital decay time needs more calculation resources .",
    "here we just follow previous works to investigate the tidal disruptions from the recoiling smbhs in spherical stellar distribution .",
    "further works with triaxial stellar distribution will be included in our next paper .",
    "actually , the triaxiality can not change our results significantly because the influence of triaxiality is moderate in galaxy models with shallow central density profiles @xcite .",
    "thus our calculations with @xmath27 will not significantly departure from the triaxial model .",
    "besides , in most of our simulations , the maximal displacement of the recoiling smbh relative to the density center is no more than @xmath172 .",
    "that keeps the trajectory of the smbh inside the bulge , where the impact of dark matter halo are very weak comparing with baryonic matter .",
    "for this reason , we neglect the influence of the triaxial dark matter halo which is mentioned by @xcite .",
    "our simulation for escaping smbh does not have enough particle resolution to estimate disruption rates .",
    "that needs much larger @xmath1-body particle number in the future simulations . here",
    "our integrations are focus on relatively low recoiling velocity . for the assumption that @xmath28 and @xmath30 , recoil velocity in our fiducial model is @xmath173 .",
    "this velocity produces the oscillating smbh an amplitude less than the effective radius of elliptical / bulge .",
    "our results show that most of tidal disruption events occur when the recoiling smbh passes through density center , but not exact the original center because of the orbital precession .",
    "the tidal disruption rates around each apocenter are much lower .",
    "an estimate for average tidal disruption rate at about apocenters in phase i over several periods for model @xmath60 has been done .",
    "we calculate the average disruption rate when smbh have large distant relative to density center .",
    "the disruption rate at large distance is several times or even an order of magnitude lower than the average value over whole phase i , which implies that the rate for apocenters is one or two order of magnitude lower than that by stationary smbhs .",
    "@xcite argued that off - nuclear x - ray tidal flares could be one of the observational signatures for an escaping smbh .",
    "unfortunately , our simulation of model @xmath160 with @xmath76 particles and the escapable recoil velocity does not have sufficient resolution to estimate the disruption rate",
    ". we can just give a lower limit @xmath167 , which does not conflict to their work with similar configurations .",

    "this value is similar to the result of model 1 with @xmath176 in @xcite . based on our results , an oscillating smbh with enough",

    "an hcss around the recoiling smbh in our integrations has similar mass as predicted by @xcite .",

    "it can be described as polarization cloud reacting to the gravitational disturbance by the recoiling smbh , in other words , the echo of dynamical friction .",
