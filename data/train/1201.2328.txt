    "self - assembly of macromolecules or nanoparticles into polymers or superlattices is an important route to produce higher - level structures with distinct properties for numerous applications.@xcite various assembled shapes can be formed , such as spheres , sheets and tubes , depending on the structural features encoded in building blocks , their mutual interactions , and possible guiding from environment . in biological systems , self - assembly of biomolecules into extended structures is very common and provides crucial functions .",
    "one example is the self - assembly of microtubules ( mts ) from @xmath0- and @xmath1-tubulin heterodimers in cells .",
    "as key components of cytoskeleton , mts play crucial roles in cell structure and movement , intracelluar protein transport , and cell division.@xcite besides being an important biological macromolecule , mts are special polymers that possess several properties distinct from standard synthetic polymers , e.g. tubular structure , reconfigurable through depolymerization - polymerization cycles , and the substrate for motor proteins .",
    "mt assembly is a very complex process and thus difficult to characterize .",
    "understanding the assembly of macromolecules that possess a subset of these properties would be remarkable and is our more practical goal .",
    "our group is interested in developing polymers that are  artificial \" mts , i.e. possess many characteristics of mts , but are assembled from different monomers and constituent molecules.@xcite in this paper we present results of an initial simulation study of the assembly of artificial mts .",
    "we focus on wedge - shaped monomers designed to self - assemble into tubular structures upon mutual binding and investigate how the assembled structures depend on binding strengths .",
    "tubulin monomers that make up mts are about 4 nm in size.@xcite they self - assemble into a helical tubular structure when their concentration is above certain threshold or when there exist appropriate nucleation sites , such as @xmath2-tubulin ring complex in eucaryotic cells.@xcite .",
    "each helical turn typically contains 13 tubulin dimers _ in vivo _ , but the number can vary from 11 to 15 _ in vitro_.@xcite the diameter of mts is around 25 nm , and their length can be as long as 25 @xmath3 m .    another type of biological macromolecules that can self - assemble into tubes are surface layer ( s - layer ) proteins , which make up the cell wall of prokaryotic organisms ( bacteria and archaea ) .",
    "s - layer proteins typically crystallize into two - dimensional arrays with various symmetries.@xcite however , particular s - layer proteins under the right conditions can form open tubes with the diameter being controlled by adding or removing amino acids.@xcite various assemblies of s - layer proteins can serve as templates to grow other extended nanostructures such as superlattices of metallic clusters.@xcite    tubular structures are also found to form in self - assembly of macromolecules that are usually amphiphilic .",
    "@xcite the location of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups and other non - covalent interaction sites results in the formation of tubes .",
    "the key issue is to understand what features ( shapes , chirality , binding strengths , etc . ) of the molecular building blocks under certain formation conditions are required to yield tubes with desired structures ( e.g. , the tube diameter ) and physical properties .",
    "however , there are so many variables that it becomes difficult to explore the whole phase space experimentally .",
    "this is where molecular simulations might be most useful to identify the range of parameters ( particularly binding strengths ) most appropriate to form tubes with controlled structures .",
    "an important , related example of self - assembly that for which some important aspects have been determined is the formation of a viral capsid from just one protein.@xcite recent theoretical and simulation work have addressed the nature of this self - assembly and revealed some simplifying aspects of the assembly.@xcite the assembly of the protein monomer into any possible structure , not just into the capsid with icosahedral symmetry , has been examined . while in the continuum limit",
    ", the free energy minimum favors icosahedral symmetry , for smaller capsids there are structural parameters that drive the specific geometry.@xcite rapaport used md simulations to study the formation of viral capsids from capsomers modeled as truncated pyramids with interaction sites on their lateral surfaces.@xcite besides showing that these capsomers are able to self - assemble into capsids , his work found important general design aspects of the capsomer for assembly to occur .",
    "he found that there is a narrow range of interaction strengths for the assembly of capsids .",
    "in addition , the simulations showed that reversibility along the assembly pathway is crucial for efficient production of complete shells by suppressing kinetic traps .",
    "similar to rapaport,@xcite we use a 3d monomer with a wedge shape that promotes assembly into tubes .",
    "reproducing all the properties of mts is out of the question and given our interest in artificial systems , not our main goal .",
    "one initial purpose is to build a minimal model of the self - assembly of tubular structures . from the viral capsid results , we expect there to be a narrow range of interactions that will yield tubule self - assembly . determining this range is essential before any further",
    ", more complex issues can be addressed .",
    "our wedge monomers have lateral and vertical ( also called `` longitudinal '' in mt literature ) binding sites on their surfaces , whose interaction strengths are independently varied .",
    "we have thus determined the optimal range of interaction strengths between monomers that achieve tubules and studied other structures that form more generally at other interaction strengths .",
    "we observed a rich set of assembled structures reminiscent of assembly of the coat protein into the tobacco mosaic virus.@xcite    the assembly of wedge - shaped monomers is in the class of associating fluids and involves living polymerization under certain circumstances . in living polymerization ,",
    "polymer chain can grow and shrink ; ultimately there is an equilibrium between single monomers and a distribution of polymer lengths .",
    "the systems of associating fluids or those undergoing living polymerization can be modeled as an ensemble of particles allowing monomers to associate to form dimers , trimers , and long chains or clusters .",
    "the theoretical description of the assembly of these systems usually starts from either wertheim theory,@xcite which is essentially a perturbation theory , or flory - huggins theory.@xcite our model wedge , particularly when only two opposite sides are active , is in the class of polymer systems . in this paper",
    "we have developed a flory - huggins type theory that particularly treats the features of our model to calculate the structure diagram as a function of the interaction parameters .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the simulation methods are described . then in sec .",
    "iii a thermodynamic theory , along the line of flory - huggins lattice model of polymerization , is developed for the self - assembly of anisotropic objects , which will be used later to explain the assembly behavior observed in md simulations .",
    "the md results are presented in sec .",
    "finally , discussion and conclusions are included in sec .",
    "in order to have a monomer that will self - assemble into a tubule structure , the monomer is chosen to have a truncated wedge shape ( fig .",

    ", we started with 27 particles in @xmath4 simple cube .",
    "the distance between two neighboring sites is @xmath5 in the initial cube .",
    "the cube is deformed into a wedge shape such that 13 of them will join to form a closed ring .",
    "the back layer is unchanged , while the front and middle layers are compressed such that the angle made by the two sides fits 13 monomers in a ring .",
    "the particles ( gray spheres in fig .",
    "[ figure : geometry ] ) interact purely repulsively through the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath6 , \\label{ljpotential}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the distance between the center of two particles , and @xmath8 is the unit of energy",
    ". the potential is truncated at @xmath9 to make the interaction purely repulsive , which indicates that two monomers will repel each other when they get very close .",
    "the attractive component of the monomer - monomer interaction occurs at sites located on the wedge surface , specifically on pairs of sites on opposite faces ( colored spheres in fig .",
    "[ figure : geometry ] ) . to control the orientation of two monomers that bind , two distinct attractive sites are necessary on a surface in order to break the symmetry of the surface - surface interaction . in fig .",
    "[ figure : geometry ] sites with the same color are attractive and sites with different colors have no interaction ( effectively repulsive due to the other interactions ) .",
    "the red and blue sites on the lateral sides promote the formation of rings . in order for the rings to stack to form a tubular structure , the two vertical ( top and bottom )",
    "faces also have a pair of attractive interaction sites ( cyan , green ) .",
    "the attractive interaction is given by @xmath10 , \\label{softpotential}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the strength of the potential and the range is given by @xmath12 .",
    "with this potential the strength and range of the attraction can be independently adjusted . in this work , we will only use @xmath13 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 for the lateral and vertical surfaces will be independently varied .",
    "we will denote the potential strengths for the lateral surfaces to be @xmath14 and for the vertical surfaces to be @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamics of self - assembly was obtained by performing md simulations using the lammps simulation package.@xcite each wedge molecule is treated as a rigid body .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated using a velocity - verlet algorithm with a time step @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the unit of time and @xmath18 is the mass of one particle .",
    "the simulations to calculate the structure diagram were run for @xmath19 to @xmath20 . unless otherwise noted , the simulations are for systems composed of @xmath21 wedges . to create an initial state without overlap of wedge monomers ,",
    "the positions of the wedge monomers was taken from an equilibrated lj system at density @xmath22 .",
    "each lj particle was replaced by a randomly oriented wedge particle and the system was scaled by the wedge particle size resulting in the volume fraction of wedges being @xmath23 .",
    "the temperature of the system is kept at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , with a langevin thermostat of damping rate @xmath26 . since",
    "the important energy scale is @xmath27 and since @xmath28 , we will use @xmath27 as the energy unit .",
    "to help understand the simulation results , we adapt a flory - huggins theory to describe the assembly behavior of wedge - shaped monomers.@xcite suppose the simulation box is divided into a three dimensional lattice with @xmath29 cells , each of which can only accommodate at most one monomer .",
    "the entropy of the system is clearly determined by the number of ways to put @xmath30 monomers into these @xmath29 cells . as introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , monomers simulated in this paper can form two types of bonds , lateral and vertical .",
    "the lateral bonding drives monomers to form closed rings , while the vertical bonding leads to the formation of filaments . ideally , the appropriate combination of these two types of bonds yields tubes .    to get the critical bonding strength required for self - assembly , we first consider the simple case where monomers assemble into linear chains ( e.g. @xmath31 ) .",
    "treating the linear case first allows us to follow much of the previous theoretical works.@xcite denote the number of @xmath32-segment chains ( consisting of @xmath32 monomers ) as @xmath33 and assume the maximum value of @xmath32 is @xmath34 , the first constraint is from the conservation of total monomers and reads @xmath35    the helmholtz free energy of our system can be written as ( see appendix for a detailed derivation ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total energy gain to form a @xmath32-segment chain , which has @xmath38 bonds , @xmath39 is the coordination number of the lattice , and @xmath40 .",

    "then the chemical potential @xmath3 is given by @xmath50 . with @xmath3 determined ,",
    "the distribution of chains @xmath33 is easily computed .",
    "if we identify @xmath51 as the equilibrium constant of dimerization , eq .",
    "( [ eqassemcond ] ) becomes identical to eq .",
    "( 5 ) in ref .",
    "40 , which was derived directly from the law of mass action .",
    "the assembly is purely controlled by the bonding energy @xmath49 when the total number of starting monomers and the volume of the box are fixed . at small @xmath49 ,",
    "monomers dominate and @xmath52 is much larger than all @xmath33 s with @xmath53 . with the increase of the magnitude of @xmath49 ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath52 monotonically decreases .",
    "the onset of assembly is identified with the condition that half of the all starting monomers are in the assembled state , i.e. , in @xmath32-segment chains with @xmath53 , while the remaining half is in the form of free monomers.@xcite using eq .",
    "( [ eqchaindist ] ) and the condition @xmath55 we obtain @xmath56 since the number of leftover monomers is @xmath57 . combining this equation with eq .",
    "( [ eqassemcond ] ) yields the critical bonding strength @xmath58 for our simulations , @xmath59 , so @xmath60 if we take @xmath61 .",
    "the theory also allows us to estimate the bonding strength required for the mass formation of @xmath32-segment chains .",
    "when @xmath62 increases from 0 , @xmath63 starts to grow , eventually surpasses @xmath52 , and becomes the dominant mode . then @xmath63 decreases and gets passed by @xmath64 , and likewise for @xmath33 with larger @xmath32 .",
    "therefore @xmath33 ( @xmath53 ) shows a maximum at certain @xmath65 that depends on @xmath32 .",
    "we identify this @xmath65 as the critical bonding strength that signals the assembly transition to @xmath32-segment chains .",
    "the corresponding equation is @xmath66 combining this condition with eqs .",
    "( [ eqchaindist ] ) and ( [ eqassemcond ] ) yields @xmath67 and a simple expression for the critical bonding energy @xmath68 note that @xmath69 is larger than @xmath70 that signals the overall assembly transition . also note that @xmath71 when @xmath72 , which seems counterintuitive but is indeed the byproduct of the approximate @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eqfreee ] ) from the lattice model .",
    "the above theory is developed for the straight polymerization of wedge monomers through vertical bonding .",
    "our simulations further indicate that it also works in the case of ring formation , i.e. , the case where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the main difference is that a ring only contains certain number of monomers . in this case",
    ", @xmath76 is finite .",
    "however , it turns out that in the range of @xmath14 where rings do form , the results from a finite @xmath76 , such as @xmath77 for ideal rings , and those from an infinite @xmath78 are very close .",
    "the reason is that chains with @xmath79 contribute little to the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eqchaindist ] ) , which is the constraint used to determine @xmath33 .    to further describe the formation of tubes",
    ", we need to take into account simultaneously both the vertical ( chain formation ) and lateral ( ring formation ) bonding interactions .",
    "it turns out a simple picture can reasonably explain our simulation results as presented in the next section .",
    "the basic idea is that as long as both the vertical and lateral bonding can occur and stay stable ( its meaning will be clarified in the next section ) , then it is possible for monomers to self - assemble into tubes , through a cluster growth process .",
    "for example , for a system dominated by @xmath32-segment linear chains formed through vertical bonding , the tubes will emerge as long as the side - to - side ( lateral ) bonding of these chains can occur and stay stable . in this case , the required lateral bonding strength will depend on @xmath32 , in addition to the @xmath32-dependence of the vertical bonding @xmath80 that controls the transition to @xmath32-segment chains . with a mapping between @xmath49 and @xmath11 , this will lead to a @xmath81 curve that signals the transition to the tubular structure phase from the filament phase . in another example , if @xmath14 is large enough to induce rings , then tubes will appear when @xmath15 is strong enough to lead to stable bonding that stacks rings together . as shown later , these arguments lead to accurate estimates of critical bonding strengths that are required for the tube formation and they agree well with our md calculations .",
    "we have varied the interaction strengths @xmath14 and @xmath15 primarily to determine the appropriate values to form tubules . given the experience with capsid",
    "assembly,@xcite we expect that there will be a narrow range of interaction strengths that are good for forming tubules without defects .",
    "we are also interested in the competition between the lateral and vertical interactions . in natural mts",
    ", it was viewed for a long time that long protofilaments formed and merged to form the tubule.@xcite in other words , the vertical interaction was stronger and vertical growth dominated .",
    "more recent experiments find that the growing end of a mt can vary by lengths corresponding to only a few tubulin dimers or even just one dimer , which implies that the vertical and lateral growth and interaction strengths are not so distinct.@xcite in cells , mts typically grow from a preexisting nucleation center , e.g. , the ring complex involving @xmath2-tubulin.@xcite there are no such preformed nucleation sites in our simulations .",
    "however , small clusters formed at an earlier stage of the assembly serves such a role as long as they can stay stable for a substantial interval . during the assembly ,",
    "such clusters capture free monomers or even other clusters to grow into tubes or larger clusters .",

    "[ figure : phase ] ) , the region encircled by these values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 accommodates large sheets . though the thermodynamic theory predicts that the lowest energy state is for these sheets to close into tubes , such closure is hindered by the quick formation of many sheets and depletion of free monomers , and difficulty of two or more sheets to join together to fuse into tubes because of structural mismatch . only on a time scale",
    "much longer than the one achievable with md , can bond breaking and structural adjustment occur to allow tubes to form . also note that vanburen _",
    "_ assumed that all the free energy of immobilizing a dimer is provided by the vertical bonding . if instead we assumed that this free energy cost is jointly compensated by both the vertical and the lateral bonds , then the lateral bond energy ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) would become larger while the vertical one ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) smaller , which moves the estimate of bond energies of a mt lattice closer to the region where we observe tube formation in our simulations .    in a recent stochastic simulation work of wu _",
    "et al . _ that studied the intermediate sheet structure found during mt assembly , two types of lateral bonds and one type of vertical bonds were assumed to have energies of 13 to 17.5 @xmath27 and 19 @xmath27 , respectively.@xcite these correspond to @xmath195 @xmath27 and @xmath196 @xmath27 .",
    "the lateral bond strength is inside the range found in this paper where tubular structures are formed , but the vertical bond strength is in the region where kinetically trapped structures are found in our simulations .",
    "however , the monomer concentration in their work is an order of magnitude lower than ours , which implies that a larger value of @xmath15 is required for tube formation in their simulations because of the increase of diffusion time and the decrease of collision rate .",
    "furthermore , in stochastic simulations it is much easier for a system to escape from kinetic traps and reach a thermodynamic equilibrium state where tubes are expected to form . we thus conclude that the parameter set used by wu _",
    "_ is consistent with the range of bond strengths suitable for tube formation found in this paper .",
    "besides the interaction strengths , the geometry of the monomer is also important in determining the self - assembled structure . surprisingly , we have found that helical tubes are more common than nonhelical tubes .",
    "the nonhelical tube has the lowest energy , but the difference between the two states is small , which is found less than the fluctuation in the energy .",
    "thus helical structures emerge with entropy as a driven force .",
    "the formation of the helical tubes occurs in a variety of ways as shown in figs .",
    "[ figure : snapshotone ] and [ figure : snapshottwo ] .",
    "once the helical structure has formed for a length of about one turn , then it is stable as helical and grows from the ends . the collisional reformation seen in fig .",
    "[ figure : snapshottwo ] is not a common mechanism .",
    "the most common mechanism appears to be the formation of a curved sheet of a few layers that has sufficient filaments to bend and touch itself . in most cases",
    "the self - contact is with a twist yielding helical tubes .",
    "this mechanisms has been seen in other systems such as lipid nanotubes .",
    "we mentioned that when @xmath197 and @xmath198 rings with various number ( @xmath199 ) of monomers can form .",
    "in our model , 13 monomers fit to make a perfect ring .",
    "so rings containing more than 13 monomers have to take a somewhat out - of - plane shape because our monomer is a rigid composite body .",
    "this shape makes tube formation difficult , though tubes do form when @xmath15 is increased above @xmath200 in this range of @xmath14 .",
    "however , only tubes with 12 or 13 filaments , either helical or nonhelical , are observed ; the majority has 13 filaments .",
    "this is slightly different from the case of mt assembly _ in vitro _",
    ", where the protofilament number of mts varies between 10 and 15 , with the vast majority having 14 protofilaments.@xcite the smaller range found in our simulations is clearly due to the fact that our monomer is rigid .",
    "the distortion of the rings containing other than 12 or 13 monomers is incompatible with the geometry of a tube , and the monomer can not adjust its shape to reduce the distortion of the ring .",
    "we have used the wedge shape to promote formation of the tubule structure .",
    "we believe that this is not necessary .",
    "a more spherical or ellipsoidal shape could be used with the lateral interaction sites being located off center in order to promote ring formation . however , changing to a more curved shape would have some consequences which would require adjustments . on the one hand ,",
    "the flat wedge surfaces yield a tighter fit between bound monomers , which raises the entropic cost and must be compensated for in the binding energy . on the other hand , a more flexible bond will be more unstable ( lower barrier ) and potentially allow other composite geometries .",
    "we have seen in the helical twist that even small variations in the geometry between two bound monomers can yield very different structures on larger scales .",
    "the wedge shape brings some simplification which enables such difficult simulations , but some of the future work will need to match more closely the actual molecular building blocks .    the goal of this work is to study a model monomer designed to form tubules , which is motivated by an interest in developing artificial mts .",
    "this model can be further developed to study real mts and it is interesting to see how well the model compares to mt assembly and structure , though only a few aspects of tubulin dimers are incorporated in the model , which will limit a direct comparison .",
    "the basic result of forming tubules and finding the appropriate range of interaction strengths , which was discussed above , is the necessary first step .",
    "the fact that helical tubules are formed in the simulations is a pleasant surprise , although one that is understandable .",
    "furthermore , it indicates that some features in the monomer must be adjusted in order to control the helical assembly .",
    "the preference for the lateral strength to be greater than the vertical strength is interesting and deserves more study .",
    "the results show the importance of nucleation in mt assembly , but generally speaking this is not a surprise in biological systems which tend to be controlled in a systematic manner .",
    "we have developed a minimal model of tube formation from wedge - shaped monomers .",
    "our simulations have identified a rich structure diagram of the assembly , which agrees well with the prediction of a simple flory - huggins lattice theory .",
    "results indicate that tubes form when both the attractive lateral and vertical binding interaction energies are at the scale of @xmath201 .",
    "tubes with fewer defects are more easily formed when the lateral interaction is slightly stronger than the vertical one .",
    "the stacking of rings is less susceptible to kinetic traps than the alignment and piecing together of filaments . there is more than one assembly mechanism for tube formation .",
    "we have observed that in addition to the main growth mechanism by absorbing free monomers , tubes can also grow through capturing dimers and oligomers , or even through collisions between clusters .",
    "our results also reveal that helical tubes are more frequently formed than nonhelical tubes , despite the fact that our monomer geometry and interaction potentials favor nonhelical structures , which have the lowest energy .",
    "part of the reason for this is that the energy difference is small , which allows transitions between rings and helices of a single turn , for example .",
    "this work sets the stage for further model developments that will incorporate additional features necessary for simulating other aspects of mts such as strong depolymerization .",
    "our interest is more in developing design rules for constructing artificial mts , but that involves understanding mts in a more general manner .",
    "the present results indicate the best range of interaction strengths to achieve artificial tubule formation .",
    "in addition , the simulations show that cells have to control multiple aspects of the formation dynamics to prevent defects from forming in the assembly of mts .",
    "tubules can collide and bind , which tends to form structures with defects . in the helical tubules",
    ", we find some with a pitch of 2 monomers instead of 1 .",
