    "the compressibility of nuclear matter has been a matter of exploration and discussion for a long time .",
    "the incompressibility or the compression modulus is a fundamental property of the nuclear matter .",
    "it constitutes a cardinal point on the equation of state ( eos ) of the nuclear matter .",
    "defined as the second derivative of the eos of the nuclear matter at the saturation density , it is also important for astrophysical phenomena such as supernova explosion and structure of neutron stars @xcite .    the breathing - mode isoscalar giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) is a principal source of information on the ( in)compressibility of nuclei and nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "nuclei undergo radial density oscillations about the equilibrium point in this mode .",
    "it is a small - amplitude collective motion wherein the nucleus participates as a whole .",
    "the isoscalar gmr is well - established experimentally and has been studied in a large number of nuclei from heavy to light mass regions in various laboratories around the world @xcite .",
    "recent measurements @xcite have brought in improved precision in providing better information on the breathing - mode gmr .",
    "experimental determination of the incompressibility of nuclear matter has entailed using a liquid - drop model type expansion of the incompressibility @xmath5 of a nucleus in terms of a bulk and finite - size components @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the breathing - mode isoscalar gmr on a large number of nuclei was used @xcite .",
    "attempts were made to extract the nuclear matter incompressibility @xmath2 using the data on sn and sm isotopes obtained with considerable precision @xcite .",
    "however , the correlation between the coulomb term and @xmath2 hinders extraction of the incompressibility of the nuclear matter @xcite .    with the difficulty of extracting @xmath2 directly using the experimental data , theoretical approach based upon interpolation amongst skyrme and gogny type interactions as proposed by blaizot @xcite has been extensively employed",
    "it has required reproducing experimental breathing - mode gmr energies of nuclei using an interaction with an appropriate value of @xmath2 in self - consistent hartree - fock and random - phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations @xcite . in this scheme",
    ", the gmr energy of @xmath6pb has been shown to be reproduced with forces with @xmath7 mev .",
    "on the other hand , the rpa calculations with force(s ) which reproduce the gmr energy of @xmath6pb give much larger value for @xmath8zr , another key nucleus , as compared to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the gmr energy of @xmath8zr @xcite has since been overestimated by @xmath9 mev in nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite rpa approach . in the same vain",
    ", the gmr energies of sn and sm isotopes could not be described within the rpa sum - rule approach @xcite using the force skm * with @xmath10 mev , which described @xmath6pb successfully though .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that the gmr energies of sn isotopes are overestimated in a self - consistent rpa approach by 1 - 2 mev by the forces which reproduce the gmr energy of @xmath6pb appropriately @xcite .    using the rmf approach and relativistic rpa ,",
    "a similar behaviour has been observed @xcite .",
    "the success of the rpa approach and extraction of @xmath2 using the interpolation method thus hinges very strongly on the nucleus @xmath6pb which masks attendant problems with other nuclei .    with the advent of the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite ,",
    "properties of nuclei and nuclear matter can be studied within this framework which has become successful in describing ground - state properties of nuclei along and far from the stability line @xcite .",
    "the inherent advantage of the rmf theory lies in the dirac - lorentz structure of nucleons , which allows a built - in spin - orbit interaction .",
    "consequently , in properties related to shell structure , especially that of the anomalous behaviour of the isotope shifts of pb nuclei , the rmf theory exhibits special advantages over the nonrelativistic skyrme theory @xcite .",
    "the breathing - mode isoscalar gmr has been studied within the rmf theory earlier @xcite .",
    "again , the theoretical or microscopic method of extracting @xmath2 entails an interpolation amongst various forces with different values of @xmath2 with a view to being able to reproduce gmr energies of nuclei such as @xmath6pb , sn isotopes and @xmath8zr among others within a microscopic approach @xcite . the lagrangian model with nonlinear scalar self - couplings of @xmath0 meson",
    "has mostly been used with this approach .",
    "it has been pointed out in a schematic approach that forces with @xmath11 in the rmf model with the nonlinear scalar self - couplings ( of the form @xmath12 ) would be compatible with the experimental gmr energy of @xmath6pb @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown recently that the gmr data on sn isotopes and @xmath8zr were overestimated by such a force @xcite .",
    "relativistic rpa calculations have also been performed with lagrangians with density - dependent meson couplings @xcite , which focus only on the key nucleus of @xmath6pb .",
    "the interpolation scheme has been the cornerstone of the theoretical method to extract the incompressibility of nuclear matter microscopically .",
    "using the various lagrangian models developed , it will be shown in this work that this approach runs into problems due to a sensitivity shown by gmr energies to the lagrangian model employed . a difference in the density dependence of the meson masses amongst the various lagrangian models and an ensuing difference in the response of the surface of nuclei to compression",
    "is ascribed for this behaviour .",
    "the subject matter of the paper is organized as follows : definitions of the basic ingradients of the gmr and the incompressibility of the nuclear matter are given in section [ gmr ] . in section [ formalism ] , the formalism of the rmf theory is provided .",
    "we discuss the lagrangian models used in this work in section [ rmf ] .",
    "details of the generator coordinate method employed to explore and calculate the gmr energies of nuclei are discussed in section [ gcm ] .",
    "it will be shown in section [ results ] that the gmr energies exhibit a sensitivity to the lagrangian model considered .",
    "we shall show that the surface incompressibility plays an important role for the gmr energies in the rmf theory .",
    "the last section summarizes the main results and an outlook for future investigations is presented .",
    "the isoscalar ( t=0 ) giant monopole resonance ( gmr ) has been well established in the last few decades @xcite .",
    "it is a breathing - mode of a nucleus wherein the nucleus undergoes a density oscillation about its equilibrium value .",
    "the breathing mode gmr energy or its frequency is related to the incompressibility @xmath5 of a nucleus with mass number @xmath13 by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nucleon mass and @xmath16 is the mean - square mass radius of the nucleus in its ground state .",
    "analogous to the expansion of the total energy of a nucleus in terms of a liquid drop formula , one can write the expansion of the incompressibility of the nucleus in terms of contributions from the volume , surface , asymmetry , coulomb and curvature terms , respectively , as @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the neutron and proton numbers , respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 s are incompressibilities ( coefficients ) representing various terms and @xmath21 s are the terms of the expansion in various powers of @xmath13 .",
    "the volume term @xmath2 is defined as the curvature of the eos of the infinite nuclear matter : @xmath22 where the second - derivative of the eos , i.e. , of @xmath23 is evaluated at the saturation density @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 represents the most significant ( reference ) point of the high - density behaviour of the infinite nuclear matter .",
    "the volume and surface terms provide the most significant contributions to @xmath5 , whereas the asymmetry and the coulomb terms are much smaller in comparison .",
    "the curvature term is even smaller than the latter two .",
    "the volume term being the largest contributor to @xmath5 influences the breathing - mode gmr energies of nuclei directly .    the coulomb term @xmath25 has been derived as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the third - derivative ( skewness ) of the eos . as readily seen from eq .",
    "( [ coul ] ) , @xmath25 is correlated to @xmath2 . in section [ results ] we shall see that the magnitude of the coefficient @xmath25 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the major contributors such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "due to this correlation superimposed on to the meagre quantity of the coulomb term , it is difficult to extract @xmath2 from breathing - mode energies @xcite . in the present work , we shall circumvent this correlation and attempt to disentangle the various terms .",
    "the starting point of the rmf theory is the basic lagrangian ( the linear walecka model ) that describes nucleons as dirac spinors interacting with the meson fields @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath15 is the bare nucleon mass and @xmath29 is its dirac spinor .",
    "nucleons interact with the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath30 mesons . here ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the respective coupling constants of the interaction .",
    "the photonic field is produced by the electromagnetic vector @xmath34 .",
    "the field tensors of the vector mesons and of the electromagnetic field are given by : @xmath35 the variational principle gives rise to the dirac equation : @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the @xmath38 potential : @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the @xmath41 potential @xmath42 the effective mass is defined by the scalar potential as @xmath43 the corresponding klein - gordon equations can be written as : @xmath44 for the linear lagrangian model , @xmath45 thus , the meson masses do not exhibit a density dependence in the linear model . for",
    "an even - even nucleus with time - reversal symmetry , the spatial components of the vector fields , and vanish .",
    "the klein - gordon equations for the meson fields are then time - independent inhomogeneous equations with the nucleon densities as sources : @xmath46 where the source terms @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 to the klein - gordon equations ( eq .",
    "[ kg2 ] ) are the scalar , vector , isovector and charge densities , respectively , as defined by nucleon spinors : @xmath51 here , the sums are taken over the valence nucleons only .",
    "the stationary state solutions @xmath52 are obtained from the coupled system of dirac ( eq . [ dirac ] ) and klein - gordon equations ( eq .",
    "[ kg2 ] ) self - consistently .",
    "the total ground - state energy of a spherical nucleus can be expressed as a functional of the baryon spinors @xmath53 @xmath54 \\equiv \\langle \\phi \\vert \\hat{h } \\vert \\phi \\rangle,\\ ] ] obtained using the hamiltonian density    @xmath55    which is given in terms of the source densities ( eq . [ dens ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy density is given by @xmath56 taking the variation of eq .",
    "( [ deq ] ) with respect to @xmath57 , the stationary dirac equation ( eq . [ dirac ] ) with energy eigenvalues @xmath58 is obtained : @xmath59 where @xmath60 solving the dirac equation ( eq . [ dd ] )",
    "self - consistently , the ground - state @xmath61 of the nucleus is written as a slater determinant of single - particle spinors @xmath52 ( i = 1,2, ...",
    "the linear walecka model has been successful in attaining saturation of nuclear matter as a delicate balance between large fields due to @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons",
    ". however , a proper description of the properties of finite nuclei was not possible until nonlinear self - couplings of the @xmath0 meson were introduced @xcite .",
    "in this work , we have considered three successful rmf lagrangian models in order to analyze the breathing - mode isoscalar gmr . in the following ,",
    "we provide a brief description of the formulation of the various lagrangian models considered .      the nonlinear sigma ( nl@xmath0 ) model is the standard lagrangian model that is used most commonly for calculation of the ground - state properties of nuclei . an important ingredient of the nl@xmath0 model is the assumption of nonlinear scalar self - couplings of the form @xcite : @xmath62 the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the nonlinear couplings of the @xmath0-meson in the conventional @xmath65 + @xmath66 model .",
    "the effective lagrangian for the nl@xmath0 model becomes @xmath67 the klein - gordon equations ( eq .",
    "[ kg1 ] ) produce a density dependence of the meson masses as given by @xmath68 only the @xmath0-meson mass exhibits an implicit density dependence in the nl@xmath0 model .",
    "the scalar self - couplings have proved to be important for an appropriate description of nuclear surface and have thus become indispensable .",
    "however , the negative quartic coupling in the model nl@xmath0 has been a source of instability in nuclear matter at higher densities @xcite .",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that a scalar - vector interaction ( svi ) model that comprises a combination of couplings of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons can dispense with the @xmath12 terms in the rmf lagrangian .",
    "the svi model is able to provide an improved description of the ground - state binding energies and charge radii of nuclei .",
    "we shall discuss the basic features of the svi model in this section below .",
    "the nl@xmath0 model is well - established and has shown to be a successful model for calculating ground - state properties of nuclei .",
    "the earliest parameter sets obtained were nl1 ( @xmath69 mev ) @xcite and nl2 ( @xmath70 mev ) @xcite .",
    "however , due to the large asymmetry energy @xmath71 , these sets were not appropriate for nuclei away from the stability line .",
    "in remedying the problem of a large neutron skin @xcite , the force nl - sh @xcite was developed as one of the first successful parameter sets in the rmf theory , which also described nuclei away from the stability line .",
    "due to a relatively larger value of @xmath2 of nl - sh , the force nl3 has been obtained @xcite with a view to getting a description of the breathing - mode gmr in a physically acceptable region .",
    ".the nuclear matter properties of various parameter sets in the nl@xmath0 model . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     without resorting to a disentanglement of @xmath5 into its respective components , we compare the gmr energies due to various parameter sets directly with the experimental values .",
    "the gmr energies with nl1 are @xmath72 3 - 4 mev smaller than the experimental values .",
    "nl3 , on the other hand , provides gmr energies which are @xmath72 1 mev smaller than the experimental ones for @xmath6pb and @xmath8zr . for @xmath73sn ,",
    "the difference of the nl3 gmr energy with the experimental value is @xmath72 0.5 mev .    in comparison ,",
    "the svi-1 gmr energies are slightly bigger than those of nl3 and hence are closer to the experimental values than nl3 .",
    "however , even with svi-1 , the difference with the experimental data , especially for @xmath6pb and @xmath8zr is not insignificant . on the other hand ,",
    "the svi-2 gmr energies for all the three nuclei come much closer to the experimental bounds .",
    "as is the case with svi-1 , the gmr energies for @xmath6pb and @xmath8zr with svi-2 are on the lower side of the experimental values , whereas for @xmath73sn , the svi-2 value is in good agreement with the experimental datum .",
    "overall , the svi-2 results show a reasonable good agreement with the experimental data for the three nuclei .",
    "the sig - om value , in comparison , comes closer to the experimental one for @xmath6pb . however , sig - om overestimates the experimental values for @xmath73sn by @xmath72 0.7 mev and slightly for @xmath8zr .",
    "thus , the behaviour of sn isotope remains anomalous in the gcm approach , as observed in nonrelativistic and relativistic rpa approach @xcite .    from the point of view of the ground - state binding energies and charge radii of nuclei and a good description of data along the stability line and away from it , in conjunction with the breathing - mode gmr energies ,",
    "the parameter set svi-2 of the svi model without self - interactions comes closest to the empirical data .",
    "it has to be seen in further exploration of other aspects of nuclear structure and properties as to how close to the data the set svi-2 will appear .",
    "it should be pointed out that this conclusion drawn here is subject to the gcm treatment of the breathing mode gmr .",
    "the constrained gcm approach delivers gmr energies slightly smaller than those obtained within the rpa approach .",
    "it is worth investigation as to how different the properties of the breathing - mode gmr would appear within the framework of relativistic rpa using various lagrangian models .",
    "the breathing - mode gmr is investigated within the framework of the rmf theory using the generator coordinate method .",
    "the gmr energy has been calculated for a few key nuclei of @xmath6pb , @xmath73sn , @xmath8zr , @xmath74ca and @xmath75ca covering a broad range of atomic mass . using",
    "the lagrangian set nl3 of the nl@xmath0 model , sets svi-1 and svi-2 of the svi model and set sig - om of the sigo model , a paradoxical behaviour of the gmr energies has been found .",
    "contrary to the received wisdom , parameter sets with a higher value of @xmath2 are observed to yield a lower value of the gmr energy as compared to a higher gmr energy attained with sets having a lower value of @xmath2 .    in order to resolve the apparent paradox of the gmr energies in the rmf theory ,",
    "the gmr response has been investigated using the three different lagrangian models viz . , the nl@xmath0 model , the svi model and the sigo model . employing the constrained gcm approach ,",
    "gmr energies have been calculated within each lagrangian model using parameter sets which encompass a broad range of @xmath2 .",
    "it is shown that each lagrangian model exhibits a gmr response that is different from the others .",
    "consequently , each lagrangian model yields a distinctly different value of the gmr energy for a given value of @xmath2 . the model nl@xmath0 delivers the lowest gmr energy for a nucleus whereas the model sigo produces the highest value amongst the three models for any given value of @xmath2 .",
    "the gmr energy is shown to exhibit a sensitivity to the lagrangian model employed .",
    "this behaviour stems from the differences in the implicit density dependence of the meson masses in various models , thus altering the density dependence of the nuclear interaction in the rmf theory from one lagrangian model to the other .",
    "the sensitivity to the density dependence opens up another dimension in the landscape of the gmr energy and incompressibility .",
    "the multiplicity of the gmr energy for a given @xmath2 in the rmf theory renders the microscopic method of extraction of @xmath2 using interpolation amongst forces as inapplicable . for this approach to work",
    ", however , it is necessary to calibrate the density dependence of the meson masses and correspondingly the nuclear interaction in the rmf theory .    using the liquid - drop type expansion of the finite nucleus incompressibility @xmath5",
    ", it is shown that for a given value of @xmath2 , each lagrangian model yields a markedly different value of the surface incompressibility @xmath3 . the model nl@xmath0 delivers the largest value of @xmath3 , whereas the model sigo provides the smallest @xmath3 amongst the three lagrangian models considered .",
    "consequently , a different value of the ratio @xmath4 emerges in different models .",
    "different @xmath3 values arising in various lagrangian models are shown to be largely responsible for a multitude of gmr energies for a given @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the response of the nuclear surface to compression is found to be dependent on the lagrangian model employed .",
    "additionally , the ratio @xmath4 with the lagrangian models nl@xmath0 and svi emerges to be significantly larger than the ratio of @xmath76 that is usually obtained with the assumption of scaling in the breathing - mode gmr @xcite .",
    "the gmr response in the non - relativistic skyrme approach is simple in contrast .",
    "the skyrme approach commonly delivers a gmr energy which depends primarily on the value of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this difference in the behaviour of the gmr energies between the rmf theory and the skyrme approach can be attributed to the fact that the form of the density dependence in the skyrme density functional is well prescribed at the outset in marked contrast to the various forms of density dependence which have emerged in the rmf theory . in a forthcoming work",
    ", we shall shed light on the differences amongst various lagrangian models , which produce a varied response to the gmr energy in the rmf theory shown in this work .",
    "further investigations will also be necessary in order to be able to discern and formulate the appropriate density dependence in the rmf theory .",
