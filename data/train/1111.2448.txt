    "tits alternative_. this alternative is a powerful result with important consequences .",
    "it was used by m. gromov in his proof of the famous `` _ _ polynomial growth _ _ '' theorem @xcite ; it also shows that linear groups satisfy _ von neumann conjecture _ : every linear group is either amenable or contains a non - abelian free subgroup .",
    "the tits alternative can be naturally modified by substituting `` finitely generated '' , `` virtually solvable '' and `` contains a non - abelian free subgroup '' with other conditions of a similar form .",
    "an example of a result of this type is the theorem of g. noskov and e. vinberg @xcite claiming that every subgroup of a finitely generated coxeter group is either virtually abelian or large .",

    "let @xmath24 be a finite graph and let @xmath44 be a family of groups .",
    "then the graph product @xmath45 satisfies the tits alternative relative to @xmath46 provided each vertex group @xmath27 , @xmath47 , satisfies this alternative .    to establish the strong version of tits alternative",
    "we will need one more condition on @xmath2 and @xmath8 :    * ( _ @xmath2-locally profi _ ) if @xmath33 is non - trivial and @xmath2-generated then @xmath48 possesses a proper finite index subgroup .",
    "let @xmath2 be a collection of cardinals and let @xmath8 be a class of groups enjoying the properties ( p@xmath21)-(p@xmath49 ) , such that @xmath7 contains all finite cardinals or at least one infinite cardinal .",
    "suppose that @xmath24 is a finite graph and @xmath25 is a family of groups .",
    "then the graph product @xmath45 satisfies the strong tits alternative relative to @xmath46 provided each vertex group @xmath27 , @xmath28 , satisfies this alternative .",
    "examples of classes of groups with properties ( p@xmath21)-(p@xmath49 ) , for @xmath50 , are the classes consisting of virtually abelian groups , virtually nilpotent groups , ( virtually ) polycyclic groups , ( virtually ) solvable groups and , more generally , elementary amenable groups .",
    "it is easy to see that all of these properties are necessary .",
    "for example , if groups from @xmath8 contain no free subgroups and @xmath51 is a non - trivial group without proper finite index subgroups then @xmath52 will possess no non - trivial finite quotients .",
    "it follows that @xmath52 can not be large ; on the other hand , @xmath53 as it contains a copy of @xmath1 .",
    "thus we see that property ( p@xmath49 ) is necessary for the claim of theorem b.    for any @xmath54 , let @xmath55 be the class of all solvable groups of derived length at most @xmath20 .",
    "denote by @xmath56 the class of all groups that are virtually in @xmath55 .",
    "it is easy to see that the pairs @xmath57 and @xmath58 enjoy the properties ( p@xmath21)-(p@xmath49 ) , for all @xmath59 with @xmath60 ( when @xmath61 the class @xmath62 , of abelian groups , does not satisfy ( p@xmath43 ) ) . hence applying theorem b we achieve    [ cor : vsol - n ]",
    "suppose that @xmath63 for some @xmath60 or @xmath64 for some @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph product of groups from @xmath8 .",
    "then any finitely generated subgroup @xmath12 of @xmath3 either is large or belongs to @xmath42 .",
    "observe that the graph product @xmath3 could be taken over an infinite graph in the above corollary because a finitely generated subgroup is always contained in a `` sub - graph product '' with only finitely many vertices ( see remark [ rem : fg_sbgp - fin_supp ] ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the group @xmath66 , of rational numbers , can be embedded into a finitely generated group from @xmath67 ( this follows from the fact that there are finitely generated center - by - metabelian groups whose center is the free abelian group of countably infinite rank ",
    "see @xcite ; taking a quotient of such a group by an appropriate central subgroup produces an embedding of an arbitrary countable abelian group into the center of a finitely generated group from @xmath67 ) .",
    "consequently , the free square of a finitely generated group from @xmath67 can contain @xmath68 , which is neither solvable nor large .",
    "thus the assumption that @xmath12 is finitely generated in corollary [ cor : vsol - n ] is essential .    applying theorem b to finitely generated right angled coxeter groups , we see that these groups satisfy the strong tits alternative relative to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the smallest class of groups containing @xmath71 , closed under isomorphisms , taking subgroups and direct products .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the class of polycyclic groups ; in particular all groups in @xmath70 will be finitely generated . a theorem of f. haglund and d. wise @xcite states that every finitely generated coxeter group is virtually a subgroup of some finitely generated right angled coxeter group .",
    "therefore we recover the result of noskov - vinberg @xcite , mentioned above :    [ cor : coxeter ] let @xmath3 be a finitely generated coxeter group . if @xmath74 is an arbitrary subgroup then either @xmath12 is large or @xmath12 is finitely generated and virtually abelian .",
    "finally we would like to suggest the strongest possible ( in our opinion ) form of tits alternative as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is a collection of cardinals , @xmath8 is a class of groups and @xmath3 is a group .",
    "we will say that @xmath3 _ satisfies the strongest tits alternative relative to _",
    "@xmath9 if for any @xmath2-generated subgroup @xmath10 either @xmath11 or @xmath12 has an epimorphism onto the free group @xmath1 of rank @xmath0 .",
    "the group @xmath75 is an example of a torsion - free large group ( @xcite ) which does not map onto @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the strongest tits alternative is indeed more restrictive than the strong tits alternative .",
    "the evident groups , satisfying the strongest tits alternative relative to the class of torsion - free abelian groups ( and arbitrary @xmath7 ) , are residually free groups .",
    "for a collection of cardinals @xmath7 , we define a new collection of cardinals @xmath76 , by saying that a cardinal @xmath77 belongs to @xmath76 if and only if @xmath78 ( see sub - section [ s : cardinals ] for the definition of the addition of cardinals ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath79 then @xmath80 ; note also that @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in order to prove the strongest alternative",
    ", we need an additional property of the pair @xmath46 :    * ( _ @xmath76-locally indicable _ )",
    "if @xmath33 is non - trivial and @xmath76-generated then @xmath48 has an infinite cyclic quotient .",
    "evidently ( p@xmath83 ) implies that every group in @xmath8 is torsion - free ( provided @xmath76 contains at least one non - zero cardinal ) .",
    "basic examples of groups satisfying ( p@xmath83 ) with @xmath50 are torsion - free nilpotent groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a collection of cardinals and let @xmath8 be a class of groups enjoying the properties ( p@xmath21)-(p@xmath84 ) and ( p@xmath83 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath24 is a finite graph and @xmath25 is a collection of groups .",
    "then the graph product @xmath45 satisfies the strongest tits alternative relative to @xmath46 provided each vertex group @xmath27 , @xmath28 , satisfies this alternative .",
    "consider any pair @xmath9 satisfying the conditions of theorem c , such that @xmath85 .",
    "then for an arbitrary non - trivial @xmath76-generated group @xmath33 , @xmath86 is @xmath2-generated and contains a copy of @xmath1 , hence @xmath87 .",
    "so , the strongest tits alternative ( relative to @xmath46 ) for @xmath3 would imply that @xmath3 maps onto @xmath1 , hence the image of @xmath48 under this homomorphism is non - trivial , and , so it possesses an epimorphism onto @xmath88 .",
    "thus the assumption of ( p@xmath83 ) in theorem c is indeed necessary .    for the first application of theorem c ,",
    "let us take @xmath79 and let @xmath42 be any class of torsion - free groups enjoying the properties ( p@xmath21)-(p@xmath84 ) ( e.g. , @xmath42 could be the class of torsion - free amenable groups ) . in this case",
    "@xmath76-local indicability is equivalent to torsion - freeness , and so ( p@xmath83 ) holds automatically .",
    "recalling that a @xmath0-generated group maps onto @xmath1 if and only if it is isomorphic to @xmath1 , we achieve    [ cor:2-gen ] let @xmath42 be a non - empty class of torsion - free groups , closed under isomorphisms , direct products and taking subgroups .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is a graph product with all vertex groups from @xmath8 .",
    "then for any @xmath0-generated subgroup @xmath10 , either @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "corollary [ cor:2-gen ] generalizes a classical result of a. baudisch @xcite , who proved that any two non - commuting elements of a right angled artin group generate a copy of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , we are now able to say much more about subgroups of right angled artin groups .",
    "indeed , taking @xmath91 and @xmath8 to be the class of finitely generated torsion - free abelian groups , and applying theorem  c we obtain the following result :    [ cor : raag ] any subgroup of a finitely generated right angled artin group is either free abelian of finite rank or maps onto @xmath1 .",
    "the finite generation assumption in the above statement is not very important .",
    "indeed , using corollary [ cor : raag ] together with remark [ rem : fg_sbgp - fin_supp ] , it is easy to show that any non - abelian subgroup of an arbitrary right angled artin group maps onto @xmath1 . an easy consequence of corollary [ cor : raag ] is that for every non - cyclic subgroup @xmath12 , of a right angled artin group , the first betti number ( i.e , the @xmath66-rank of the abelianization ) is at least two .    as far as we know , corollary [ cor : raag ] gives the first non - trivial family of groups satisfying the strongest tits alternative ( it is not hard to construct right angled artin groups that are not residually free ) .",
    "the family of subgroups of right angled artin groups is very rich and includes a lot of examples examples ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , corollary [ cor : raag ] can be used to show that many groups are not embeddable into right angled artin groups .",
    "more precisely , one can obtain information regarding solutions of an equation in a right angled artin group from the solutions of the same equation in free and free abelian groups .",
    "for example , we have    [ cor : abc ] if three elements @xmath92 of a right angled artin group @xmath3 satisfy @xmath93 for @xmath94 , then these elements pairwise commute .",
    "the above fact is an immediate consequence of corollary [ cor : raag ] and the result of r. lyndon and m. schtzenberger @xcite , who proved the same statement when @xmath3 is free .",
    "corollary [ cor : abc ] generalizes a theorem of j. crisp and b. wiest ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) , who established its claim in the case when @xmath95 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : basic_prop ] we recall some basic properties of graph products , and in section [ s : parabolic ] we develop the theory of parabolic subgroups of graph products .",
    "the results of this section , together with bass - serre theory , allow us to prove , in section [ s : structuretheorem ] , the structure theorem for subgroups of graph products which do not contain a copy of @xmath1 ( theorem [ thm : structure ] ) .",
    "the structure theorem is one of the main results of this work , and it is intensively used in the proofs of theorems a , b and c. we apply the structure theorem to give a more detailed description of `` small '' subgroups of graph products ( see theorem [ thm : sharpa ] ) , and theorem a is a consequence of this description .    in order to prove theorems b and c , we study the kernel of the canonical retraction of a graph product onto one of the vertex groups and prove that this kernel is again a graph product ( theorem [ thm : kernel ] ) .",
    "this fact has a number of interesting applications , which are established in section [ s : kernel ] . in section [",
    "s : proof ] we establish a sufficient criterion for a subgroup of a graph product to be large or to map onto @xmath1 ( theorem [ thm : main_crit ] ) , and then we prove theorems b and c. finally , in section [ s : example ] we construct two examples showing that the claims of corollaries [ cor:2-gen ] and [ cor : raag ] are in a certain sense optimal .",
    "example [ ex:2-gen_non_virt_cyc ] shows that without the assumption of torsion - freeness , there is no control over @xmath0-generated subgroups of graph products ; and proposition [ prop : ex_fr_rank ] demonstrates that there is no connection between the rank of a non - abelian subgroup of a right angled artin group and the maximal rank of the free group onto which it can be mapped .",
    "the latter is based on a rips - type construction , which is presented in proposition [ prop : rips_constr ] .",
    "our reference for cardinal numbers is @xcite .",
    "cardinals are traditionally well - ordered by injection ( @xmath96 if there is an injective map from @xmath4 to @xmath97 ) , but , assuming the axiom of choice , this ordering is equivalent to the ordering defined via surjections , which we will use ( see ( * ? ? ?",
