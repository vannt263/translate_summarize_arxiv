    "measurements of identified charged hadron ( @xmath9 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) ) transverse spectra at @xmath15 gev/@xmath2 in elementary p+p collisions provide a good test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) @xcite . in pqcd calculations , the inclusive production of single hadrons is described by the convolution of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , parton - parton interaction cross - sections , and fragmentation functions ( ff ) .",
    "the ffs were parameterized according to experimental measurements in @xmath16 collisions but are not well constrained .",
    "a more precise constraint on the quark and gluon ffs by comparing theory with experimental data is crucial to understand hadron production mechanisms .",
    "in addition , these measurements in p+p collisions at high @xmath1 provide an essential baseline for studying parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we use events triggered by an electro - magnetic calorimeter and extend the identified charged particle measurements up to 15 gev/@xmath2 , and neutral kaons up to 12 gev/@xmath2 in p+p collisions at @xmath5 = 200 gev .",
    "this significantly extends particle @xmath1 reach beyond previously published measurements of up to 10 , 5 , and 7 gev/@xmath2 respectively for pions , @xmath17 , and protons in p+p collisions using events triggered with minimum bias  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic ionization energy loss ( @xmath18 ) in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) was used for charged hadron identification . a new method",
    "to re - calibrate the tpc @xmath18 was developed and applied  @xcite , which significantly reduced the systematic uncertainties for protons compared to previous measurements  @xcite . in these proceedings , identified particle @xmath1 spectra , and the particle ratios ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are presented and compared with next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd calculations , and with pythia results .",
    "nuclear modification factors @xmath10 , the spectra in au+au collisions divided by spectra in p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions , are presented and compared with theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "the p+p collision events with enhanced high-@xmath1 charged particles we use in this analysis are obtained from an online trigger by the barrel electro - magnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) with 0@xmath4 @xmath22 @xmath4 1 and full ( 2@xmath23 ) azimuthal coverage in the year 2005  @xcite .",
    "charged particle tracking is performed with the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , spanning @xmath24 @xmath4 1.8 and 2@xmath23 in azimuth , which enables particle identification through measurements of momentum and @xmath18  @xcite . in p+p collisions , @xmath255.6 million events triggered by transverse energy @xmath26 @xmath12 6.4 gev in single bemc towers ( jp2 events ) ,",

    "neutral kaons are reconstructed in the ht1 and ht2 triggered events through the @xmath27 decay mode , while jp2 triggered events are used to measure charged hadrons .",
    "these events also serve to check for a trigger bias by comparing @xmath28 on the near side of the trigger ( in azimuth ) with @xmath13 on the away side using other triggered events .",
    "the charged kaon analysis involves @xmath2521.2 million central au+au collisions .",
    "the segment length @xmath29 dependence of @xmath18 , gas multiplication gains , noise of tpc electronics , and pileup in high luminosity environment may cause the measured @xmath18 of charge particles in the tpc to deviate from the expected values , as calculated from the bichsel function  @xcite . in the relativistic rise region ,",
    "the separation of @xmath18 peaks among @xmath9 , @xmath13 and p(@xmath30 ) are between approximately 1 to 3 @xmath31 .",
    "pions are the dominant particle species for inclusive and jet hadrons , and their @xmath18 distributions overlap the smaller kaon and ( even smaller ) proton distributions within any given momentum slice , preventing clear peak separation .",
    "this results in large systematic errors in attributing yields to species due to the uncertainty of the reconstructed @xmath18 peak positions .",
    "the re - calibration method is important to improve these systematics  @xcite . with the bichsel function , normalized @xmath18 distributions for charged particles",
