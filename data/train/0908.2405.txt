    "tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 and gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 belong to the rare earth r@xmath0(si@xmath9ge@xmath10)@xmath1 series compounds .",
    "these materials exhibit large magnetocaloric ( mc ) effects @xcite and are currently attracting much attention for their potential application in magnetic refrigeration @xcite . both tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 and gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 are rich in magnetic properties @xcite and are believed to play a key role in understanding the underlying physics of the r@xmath0(si@xmath9ge@xmath10)@xmath1 systems .",
    "they both crystallize in the sm@xmath0ge@xmath1-type crystallographic structure and adopt the same magnetic space group , @xmath11 @xcite . tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 and gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 undergo long range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transitions at @xmath12 92 k and @xmath12 127 k , respectively .",
    "the magnetic structure of tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 and gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 consist of tb / gd - rich block layers in the @xmath4-plane that stack along the @xmath5-axis with strong ferromagnetic intralayer and weak afm interlayer interactions .",
    "gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 has a collinear afm structure with the magnetic moments lying within the block layers along the c - axis .",
    "tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 orders in a similar fashion , although the single - ion anisotropy results in significant canting of the moments at low temperature .",

    "two phase transitions were observed : the afm transition at @xmath13 92 k and a second phase transition at @xmath12 55 k. the @xmath12 55 k transition was attributed to a spin reorientation transition similar to that proposed for gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 at @xmath12 75 k @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the spin reorientation transition in both gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 and tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 may arise from the delicate competition between the magnetic anisotropy from the spin - orbit coupling of the conduction electrons and the dipolar interaction anisotropy @xcite .",
    "in addition to the afm and spin reorientation transitions , it is of particular interest that significant magnetic short - range correlations ( src ) was suggested in gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 at temperatures both below and above @xmath2 based upon the low magnetic field dc magnetization and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements @xcite .",
    "it has been interpreted as evidence of a griffiths - like phase similar to the one observed in tb@xmath0si@xmath14ge@xmath14 , investigated by small - angle neutron scattering @xcite . a griffiths phase ( gp )",
    "@xcite is a nanoscale magnetic clustering phenomenon that is usually associated with competing magnetic interactions in the system @xcite .",
    "it is possible for a griffiths - like phase to exist in gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 due to the competition between fm and afm interactions in gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 , fm interactions within the layers , and either afm or fm interactions between the layers ( small structural changes or applying relatively low magnetic field comparing to @xmath2 can switch the interlayer interactions between afm & fm interactions therefore switch the low temperature phase between afm order or fm order ) .",
    "however , studies of gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 have been hampered by the large neutron absorption cross - section of gadolinium .",
    "tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 exhibits similar magnetic properties as to gd@xmath0ge@xmath1 hence it is an ideal candidate for neutron scattering studies of magnetic src displayed in these compounds .",
    "we report here neutron diffraction studies of the afm phase transition and the magnetic src in tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 .",
    "a large tb@xmath0ge@xmath1 single crystal ( @xmath12 5 grams ) was used for the neutron diffraction experiment .",
    "the single crystal was grown at the materials preparation center @xcite using the bridgman technique as described in ref . .",
    "the mosaic of the crystal is 0.41(3)@xmath15 along the @xmath16-axis and 0.63(2)@xmath15 along the @xmath5-axis as determined by the full width at half maximum of the ( 400 ) and ( 060 ) bragg peak rocking curves .",
    "the crystal was mounted on a thin aluminum post , oriented in the ( @xmath170 ) scattering plane , and sealed in a helium filled aluminum sample can .",
    "a closed - cycle helium refrigerator ( displex ) was used which allows accurate temperature control between 10 k and 300 k. the experiments were performed using the hb1a triple - axis spectrometer located at the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) at the oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl ) .",

    "two highly oriented pg filters were mounted before and after the second monochromator to significantly reduce higher order contaminations of the incident beam ( i.e. , @xmath19 10@xmath20 .",
