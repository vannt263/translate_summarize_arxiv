    "the theory of patternavoiding permutations has been an active field of research over the past decades . for any permutations @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , the permutation @xmath9 is said to involve @xmath10 , or @xmath10 is called a pattern of @xmath9 , if there exists a substring @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) that is orderisomorphic to @xmath10 .",
