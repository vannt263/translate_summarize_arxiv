    "the decrease of the ice viscosity with increasing content of liquid water in temperate ice was first confirmed and measured by @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to simulate the water content in glaciers and ice sheets realistically , especially if the temperate ice occurs in a basal layer where shear deformation is largest .",
    "mathematical models of polythermal ice masses were introduced and further developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we distinguish essentially two types of polythermal glaciers , canadian - type polythermal glaciers , which are cold in most of the ice mass except for a temperate basal layer in the ablation zone , and scandinavian - type glaciers , which are temperate in most parts except for a cold surface layer in the ablation zone ( fig .",
    "[ fig : canadian_scandinavian ] ) @xcite .",
    "this work attempts to verify thermodynamic schemes used in shallow ice sheet models .",
    "therefore , we do not investigate processes which are not usually included in ice sheet models , such as possible diffusion of water in temperate ice @xcite and pre - melting in ice at sub - freezing temperatures .",
    "for verification of numerical solutions with exact solutions , we neglect the pressure dependence of the melting point and the temperature dependence of the heat conductivity and specific heat capacity . following @xcite , ``",
    "ice is treated as temperate if a change in heat content leads to a change in liquid water content alone , and is considered cold if a change in heat content leads to a temperature change alone . ''",
    "this implies that temperate ice is at the melting point and the temperatures in cold ice are below the melting point .",
    "polythermal schemes that solve the field equations for the cold and temperate layers separately were implemented for both types of polythermal glaciers , in one dimension for the scandinavian - type storglaciren , sweden @xcite , in two dimensions for the canadian - type laika glacier , canada @xcite and for three - dimensional ice sheets , which are canadian - type polythermal @xcite . with the assumption that water mostly accumulates along the trajectories of ice particles in the temperate layer , @xcite used a trajectory model to determine the position of the cold - temperate transition surface ( cts ) and the water content in the temperate part of storglaciren .",
    "@xcite suggested an enthalpy scheme with the idea that , with enthalpy , only one thermodynamic field variable must be computed , and the temperature and water content result from the enthalpy as diagnostic fields .",
    "the domains of cold and temperate ice are discriminated by the contour of the enthalpy of ice with no liquid water content at the melting point .",
    "a crucial point in polythermal enthalpy schemes is their treatment of the stefan - type energy- and mass - flux matching conditions at the cts , which are important for determining its position @xcite .",
    "these transition conditions are not included explicitly in the formulation of the enthalpy scheme according to @xcite .",
    "two different cases must be distinguished .",
    "melting conditions occur if cold ice flows across the cts into the temperate region . at the cts , the particles consist of ice at melting temperature without liquid water , and , after",
    "the transition , start to accumulate water due to strain heating .",
    "thus , the boundary condition on the temperate side of the cts is zero water content . to match the vanishing latent heat flux ,",
    "the diffusive heat flux and corresponding enthalpy gradient on the cold side must also vanish .",
    "the situation is different for freezing conditions at the cts , where the ice flows from the temperate region into the cold region and the liquid water content of the temperate ice freezes at the cts .",
    "the advective latent heat flux on the temperate side then changes into a diffusive heat flux on the cold side .",
    "thus , a drop of a non - vanishing water content to zero results in a non - vanishing temperature ( enthalpy ) gradient in the cold layer at the cts .",

    "the liquid water content ( mass fraction ) of temperate ice is defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the partial density of liquid water in the mixture .",
    "let @xmath10 be the enthalpy of ice at the melting temperature with vanishing water content . for cold ice with a temperature @xmath11 and temperate ice with a water content @xmath12 , the enthalpy",

    "to reduce the problem of a polythermal ice mass to a one - dimensional problem , we apply the plane strain approximation for a two - dimensional flow in the vertical @xmath27-@xmath28 plane of a parallel - sided slab with constant and steady thickness @xmath29 and constant inclination angle @xmath30 , and without dependencies on the transverse @xmath31 coordinates ( fig .",

    "let @xmath42 be the ice volume flux relative to the moving cts , where @xmath43 is the kinematic ( migration ) velocity of the cts in @xmath28-direction .",
    "melting conditions are then characterised by @xmath44 and freezing conditions by @xmath45 .",
    "we limit our considerations to the case that the kinematic velocity of the cts is smaller than the ice velocity in @xmath28-direction ( @xmath46 ) , so that melting and freezing conditions correspond to downward ( @xmath47 ) and upward ice motion ( @xmath48 ) , respectively .    for melting conditions , ice at the melting temperature with no liquid water flows from the cold into the temperate layer , where water is produced along a trajectory of an ice particle by strain heating , thus @xmath49 ( where the cold layer is defined as the positive , and the temperate layer as the negative side of the cts ) .",
    "together with the imposed surface enthalpy @xmath50 , the enthalpy @xmath51 at the cts and the vanishing enthalpy gradient constitute three boundary conditions for the cold layer , which determine the evolution of the enthalpy profile and the thickness of the cold layer , thus also the position of the cts .",
    "since we have neglected water diffusion in the temperate layer , the enthalpy @xmath51 at the cts alone determines the evolution of the enthalpy profile in the temperate layer ; no additional basal boundary condition is required . however ,",
    "if a regularising small water diffusion were applied , an additional basal boundary condition would be needed , which then should be chosen carefully in order not to influence the numerical solution significantly ( for instance , a zero - flux condition ) .    for freezing conditions ,",

    "the advection equation for enthalpy in the temperate layer requires one boundary condition , for which we use the enthalpy at the ice base . assuming a vanishing water content of the basal ice yields @xmath57 for the cold layer , the dirichlet conditions ( [ eq:4.12 ] ) ( prescribed surface enthalpy ) and ( [ eq : freezcond])@xmath58 determine the evolution of the enthalpy profile , and condition ( [ eq : freezcond])@xmath59 can be used to determine the evolution of the cts position by solving it for the kinematic velocity @xmath60 that is contained in the volume flux @xmath61 .",

    "an established strategy to compute polythermal ice masses numerically is to split the computational domain into two distinct domains of cold and temperate ice , and compute the respective temperature and water content on two different grids @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , it is desirable to produce a numerical solution of the problem with a one - layer scheme , i.e. , on one grid that spans the entire polythermal domain . here , we describe possibilities for enthalpy - based two - layer and one - layer schemes for both melting and freezing conditions at the cts .    for all schemes",

    "the evolution of the cts position is smooth for the two - layer scheme , whereas it occurs in steps for the one - layer scheme .",
    "this is a consequence of the cts tracking on the discrete grid in the one - layer scheme ( section  [ ssec : numerics_one_layer_2 ] ) , which only allows an accuracy of one grid spacing .",

    "it can only be reproduced reasonably well by the highest resolution of 0.5 m , while the 1-m resolution reproduces the variability only rudimentarily , and the 2-m resolution yields only an average cts position . for the long period ( 500 years ) , the results are less susceptible to the grid resolution , of comparable quality to those for the step - change forcing shown in fig .

    "the three different solid lines correspond to grid resolutions of 0.5 m ( black ) , 1 m ( medium - grey ) and 2 m ( light - grey).,width=302 ]      we now compare the performance of the one - layer freezing cts scheme with that of the two - layer front - tracking scheme .",
    "figure [ fig : freezestep ] shows the evolution of the height of the cts above the bed and the water content at the temperate side of the cts for the step - change scenarios from @xmath142c to @xmath130c and vice versa ( section  [ sec : setup ] ) . like in section  [ ssec : results_one_layer_2 ] , for the one - layer scheme , the three different resolutions of 0.5 m , 1 m ( standard ) and 2 m have been employed .    since the upward - moving ice reduces the response of the system to surface perturbations at a given depth , the freezing cts requires a longer time for adjustment than the melting cts ( compare with fig .  [",
    "fig : meltstep]a ) .",
    "a further , notable difference is that the cts evolution is smooth for both the one - layer and two - layer schemes .",
    "this is a consequence of the sub - grid tracking of the cts employed in the one - layer freezing cts scheme ( section  [ ssec : numerics_one_layer_3 ] ) , whereas the one - layer melting cts scheme allows tracking the cts only with grid - limited precision ( section  [ ssec : numerics_one_layer_2 ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the computed water content at the cts shows some step changes for the one - layer scheme , while it is also smooth for the two - layer scheme .",
    "for all three resolutions of the one - layer scheme , the results agree well with those of the two - layer scheme ; the largest ( but still acceptable ) discrepancy is found for the water content at the cts computed with the 2-m resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : freeze - periodic ] shows the evolutions of the cts positions for the two scenarios with sinusoidal forcings ( section  [ sec : setup ] ) , computed with the one - layer freezing cts scheme and the two - layer scheme .",
    "the amplitude of the variations of the cts position is substantially smaller than that of the melting cts even though the amplitude of the surface perturbation is larger ( 2k vs.1k ) , which is again due to the upward direction of the ice motion that delays and dampens changes of the surface conditions at depth . for both periods ( 100 and 500 years ) and",
    "all resolutions , the agreement to the reference results ( two - layer scheme ) is within about the grid resolution of the one - layer scheme . as already observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezestep]a , the sub - grid tracking leads to a smooth evolution of the cts , and the simulated amplitudes agree very well for all schemes and resolutions .",
    "the conventional one - layer scheme , which corresponds to the implementation of the enthalpy method by @xcite , does not explicitly take into account the stefan - type energy- and mass - flux matching conditions at the cts that are crucial for determining the position of the cts .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated that this scheme can determine the cts position for the case of melting conditions correctly . however , this depends critically on the proper numerical handling of the discontinuity of the conductivity across the cts and is therefore prone to failure if the implementation is not done with great care . for the case of freezing conditions with the associated discontinuity of the enthalpy at the cts ,",
    "the conventional one - layer scheme fails inevitably .",
    "two - layer front - tracking schemes , using a time - dependent terrain - following coordinate transformation for the cold and temperate layers separately @xcite , can also be used in conjunction with the enthalpy method .",
    "we have constructed such a scheme , and have shown that it produces very good results for both melting and freezing conditions .",
    "however , schemes using only one grid for the entire polythermal slab are simpler to implement in existing ice sheet models and therefore more desirable .",
    "therefore , we have proposed one - layer methods that modify the original enthalpy scheme by @xcite in order to treat explicitly the transition conditions at the cts for both cases of a melting and freezing cts .",
    "the proposed methods work well in our one - dimensional model , provided that the time steps and grid resolutions are sufficiently small .",
    "we expect them to work as well in shallow ice sheet models , where the thermodynamics neglects horizontal diffusive heat fluxes and thus treats vertical enthalpy or temperature profiles essentially in a one - dimensional way .",
    "horizontal advective heat fluxes can be treated as additional source terms of the vertical profiles .",
    "in fact , we have already implemented the one - layer melting cts scheme in the ice sheet model sicopolis ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; url http://www.sicopolis.net/ ) , which , despite the required adjustments for the additional physics ( pressure dependence of the melting point as well as temperature - dependent heat conductivity and specific heat capacity accounted for ) , could be done in a fairly straightforward way ( paper in preparation ) . with some additional effort due to",
    "the complicating horizontal diffusive heat fluxes , implementations in non - shallow ( higher - order or full stokes ) ice sheet and glacier models should also be feasible .",
