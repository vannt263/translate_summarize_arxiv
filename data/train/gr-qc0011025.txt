    "black holes , objects so compact that not even light can escape their gravitational pull , are among the most intriguing concepts of modern science .",
    "as kip thorne wrote in 1974 : `` of all the conceptions of the human mind from unicorns to gargoyles to the hydrogen bomb perhaps the most fantastic is the black hole : a hole in space with a definite edge over which anything can fall and nothing can escape ; a hole that curves space and warps time . ''",
    "evidence that these exotic objects exist in our universe has been mounting since the discovery of the archetypal black hole cygnus x1 in 1971 .",
    "today , the presence of supramassive black holes ( several million times as massive as our sun ) at the centre of many galaxies , and smaller black holes ( 5 - 10 times as massive as the sun ) in x - ray binary systems , is generally accepted .    from the mathematical point of view ,",
    "a black hole is a spacetime defined by a four - dimensional metric tensor , that is , a solution of einstein s equations , with characteristic properties .",
    "the simplest black hole is spherically symmetric and non - rotating .",
    "it is known as the schwarzschild black hole , and is described by the metric tensor @xmath0 which is given by @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the infinitesimal element of proper time , the coordinates are @xmath3 , and we have defined @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a constant given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the black hole mass and @xmath8 is newton s constant . in the following",
    "we will always choose so - called geometrised units in which both the speed of light @xmath9 and @xmath8 are equal to unity .",
    "we will also assume that repated indices indicate summation , as in ( [ schw ] ) .",
    "we are interested in scattering problems involving black holes .",
    "in such problems the curvature of spacetime enters not only at the level of the boundary conditions , but also in the equations describing the propagation of the various wave - fields ( scalar , electromagnetic or gravitational ) that we may be interested in .",
    "therefore the problem of scattering by black holes has more in common with scattering in media with a non - constant index of refraction than scattering by a physical object . in the case of a black hole , it is the curvature of space - time itself which is doing the scattering .    in this article",
    "we aim to summarise work in this research area , and relate them to results in familiar contexts such as quantum scattering",
    ". we will discuss possible diffraction effects , resonances , and digress on some of the peculiarities of the black - hole problem .",
    "it is useful to begin our discussion with the simplest of scattering problems involving black holes ; namely , the bending of light rays propagating in a black hole spacetime .",
    "let us consider an astronaut who , while piloting his spaceship towards a schwarzschild black hole ( figure [ rocket ] ) , shines a laser directly out his window , in the positive @xmath10 direction .",
    "the trajectory of the laser beam can be found by solving the equation for a null geodesic ( a line that is `` as straight as possible '' in the curved spacetime ) .",
    "hence we are looking for a solution to the geodesic equation @xmath11 where the christoffel symbols @xmath12 are functions of the coordinates @xmath13 . in order to be null ,",
    "our geodesic must satisfy @xmath14 .",
    "now , if we use the schwarzschild coordinates introduced in ( [ schw ] ) we can cast the equation for a null geodesic into the following form : @xmath15^{-1/2 } \\ . \\label{nulgeoeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the impact parameter defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the angular momentum and the energy associated with the photon . from equation ( [ nulgeoeq ] ) we can deduce the properties of various light trajectories .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ rocket ]    as the astronaut nears the black hole , the laser beam is deflected more and more by the spacetime curvature  see figure  [ nulgeos ] .",
    "the curves in figure  [ nulgeos ] are the solutions of equation ( [ nulgeoeq ] ) with @xmath20 and @xmath16 ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath23 corresponds to a circle .",
    "this is known as the unstable photon orbit , and its existence means that our astronauts laser beam will circle the black hole and illuminate his neck ! after passing @xmath23",
    "the astronaut finds that the laser beam is always deflected into the black hole .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ nulgeos ]    when he reaches @xmath24 , the astronaut applies his rockets in such a way that the spaceship hovers at a constant distance from the black hole , and tries to shine his light at various angles .",
    "he then finds that there is still a ( small ) range of angles at which the light beam can escape the black hole ( see figure  [ anglesp ] ) .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ anglesp ]    once the astronaut has resumed his fall towards the black hole , and reached @xmath25 , the solid angle into which he must shine his laser in order for the light to escape the black hole has shrunk to a single point .",
    "he must aim it in the positive @xmath26 direction .",
    "however , even if he hovers at constant @xmath27 , the ratio of the light frequency received ( @xmath28 ) by his home planet at ( say ) @xmath29 to the frequency emitted ( @xmath30 ) is the ratio of the proper times at the two points .",
    "this follows from the formula for the _ gravitational redshift _ :",
    "@xmath31 from this we see that when @xmath25 the light is completely redshifted away .",
    "therefore any light emitted after the astronaut reaches this limit , whatever the direction , remains inside the black hole .",
    "our space traveller has reached the so - called event horizon , and he can neither escape the black hole nor alert a rescue team of his fate .",
    "the above discussion illustrates some of the extreme effects that the curvature of a black - hole spacetime might have on light trajectories .",
    "still , the ideas are relevant also in a more familiar setting .",
    "in fact , the first experimental verification of einstein s theory of general relativity was the measurement of the bending of starlight by the gravitational field of the sun during a solar eclipse of 1919 . while the sun is certainly not a black hole , the metric tensor exterior to the surface of the sun is accurately described by ( [ schw ] ) .",
    "thus , in a sense , the first test of general relativity was also the first ` black - hole scattering ' experiment .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ deflection ]    let us assume that @xmath32 is small ( @xmath33 ) but not negligible .",
    "if we introduce a new variable @xmath34 we can approximate our equation ( [ nulgeoeq ] ) as @xmath35 integration of this leads to @xmath36 the initial trajectory was such that @xmath37 , which means that @xmath38 , defining the incoming direction .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath39 that the light ray will ever reach corresponds to @xmath40 when @xmath41 . by symmetry the ray will be deflected by an equal amount as it recedes to infinity . hence , the final result will be @xmath42 , and since the result would have been @xmath43 if the light ray had followed a straight path , we have a total deflection of @xmath44 this result was first calculated by einstein , and as noted above , this deflection was measured by eddington and collaborators in 1919 .",
    "# 1#2 # 1/#2      with enhanced observational capabilities , ranging from large radio telescopes to the repaired hubble space telescope , astronomers have found plenty of evidence that light often bends as it travels through space .",
    "this is known as gravitational lensing . before discussing some of these observations",
    "it is instructive to describe the simplest lensing situation ; the case when light from a distant quasar is lensed by a localised mass distribution ( treated as a point source with mass @xmath5 ) on its way to the observatory .",
    "the relevant geometry is shown in figure  [ glens ] .",
    "we denote the true angular separation from the lens to be @xmath45 , consider a light ray that passes the lens at a minimum distance @xmath46 ( essentially the impact parameter from the previous section ) and is deflected an angle @xmath47 by the spacetime geometry . assuming that @xmath48 we do not need to worry about diffraction effects , and can analyse the problem using simple geometry . disregarding complicating factors",
    "one can show that the condition that the light ray reaches the observer leads to @xmath49 where we have defined @xmath50 and the distances @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are as shown in figure  [ glens ] .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ glens ]    in other words , we solve @xmath54 and get @xmath55 that is , we always get two solutions of opposite sign .",
    "this means that there will typically be one image on each side of the lens .",
    "a special case worthy of notice arises when the source , lens and observer are all aligned .",
    "then we have @xmath56 and it is easy to realise that there is then no preferred plane for the light rays to travel in . thus the whole ring of angular radius @xmath57 is a solution to the simple lensing equation .",
    "this is commonly known as an ` einstein ring ' and , as is easy to see , such images can only occur in lensing by axially symmetric mass distributions .",
    "the above description is obviously idealised in many ways , and in analysing observed gravitational lenses one must consider much more complicated mass distributions , as well as use detailed cosmological models .",
    "still , the above example illustrates the basic principles , and we now turn to some actual observations of gravitational lensing .",
    "the first lensing candidate was observed using a radio telescope at jodrell bank in 1979 and is catalogued as 0957 + 561 .",
    "it is a typical example of a double image of a distant quasar .",
    "when the spectra of the two images were studied it was found that they were remarkably similar , but redshifted to slightly different extent .",
    "it was concluded that the two images were extremely unlikely to correspond to separate individual quasars .    since this first discovery , many other double image systems have been observed .",
    "more complicated systems , comprising of further images , have also been found . among them",
    "are the triple image lenses 2016 + 112 and 0023 + 171 .",
    "perhaps the most unique multiple image case found so far is 2237 + 0305 , more commonly known as the `` einstein cross '' . in this beautiful system , shown in figure  [ einstein ] , one can see four distinct images .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    [ einstein ]    the above examples are all likely examples of lensing by ` point sources ' . for extended mass distributions , like galaxies",
    ", one would expect to see also arcs and in some unique cases almost complete einstein rings .",
    "the first arcs ( abell 370 and cl224 - 02 ) were actually found when gravitational lenses were still considered a mere theoretical possibility . since then many further examples of lensed arcs",
    "have been discovered , as well as nearly complete rings .",
    "one interesting example of the latter is mg1131 + 0456 .    as our observational capabilities continue to improve the list of lensed systems is rapidly growing .",
    "new observations provide challenges for the theorists that want to deduce the geometry of the lensing mass distribution as well as understand the nature of the original light source .",
    "ideally , one would also like to be able to use lensing observations of distant quasars to also deduce information about cosmology .",
    "considerable progress in these directions have been made in recent years , and our understanding should continue to improve with the observational data . for further details , we refer the reader to the monograph by schneider , ehlers and falco @xcite .",
    "having discussed some classic examples and exciting observations of the scattering of light by massive bodies we now turn to the issue of possible diffraction effects . essentially , most models of the gravitational lensing phenomenon are based on `` geometrical optics '' .",
    "therefore one would not expect these calculations to yield any insight into possible wave phenomena .",
    "however , as we will see , the extreme nature of black holes lead to the existence of many complicated diffraction effects . to understand these it is essential that we develop a framework for studying the scattering of waves by black holes . from an observational point of view",
    ", our main interest will be focussed on electromagnetic and gravitational waves .",
    "the latter are particularly interesting since a new generation of gravitational - wave detectors is due to come online in the next few years .",
    "it is generally believed that these will make the long - heralded field of gravitational - wave astronomy a reality , and that they will allow us ot make detailed observations of the physics in the immediate vicinity of a black hole @xcite .    in order to introduce the various concepts involved in studies of the scattering of waves by black holes we will consider the relatively simple case of scalar waves .",
    "this may seem like a peculiar choice given that no massless scalar fields have yet been observed in nature .",
    "however , it turns out that the main equations governing a weak electromagnetic field , or gravitational waves , in a curved spacetime are essentially the same as the scalar field wave equation ( see for example equation ( [ teuk0 ] ) ) .",
    "hence , the scalar field serves as a useful model .",
    "see chandrasekhar @xcite for an exhaustive study .",
    "let us consider a scalar field @xmath58 propagating in the schwarzschild spacetime , as described by ( [ schw ] ) .",
    "the equation governing the evolution of the scalar field is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the determinant of @xmath61 .",
    "since the schwarzschild spacetime is spherically symmetric , we may assume a fourier decomposition @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "if the boundary conditions are cylindrically symmetric , as they would be in the plane - wave scattering problem , the @xmath64 axis ( @xmath65-axis ) can always be chosen to be the axis of symmetry .",
    "we can therefore assume that @xmath66 to be independent of @xmath10 and perform the sum over @xmath67 , writing @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a legendre function .    in the schwarzschild spacetime",
    "the wave equation for the scalar field reduces to the following schrdinger - type equation for @xmath70 : @xmath71 \\hat{\\phi}_l = 0 , \\label{de}\\ ] ] where the so - called tortoise coordinate is defined by @xmath72 this integrates to @xmath73 and we see that introducing the tortoise coordinate corresponds to `` pushing the event horizon of the black hole away to @xmath74 '' .",
    "the effective potential is explicitly given by @xmath75.\\ ] ] it is positive definite and has a single peak in the range @xmath76 $ ] , see figure  [ hump2 ] .",
    "a black hole is distinguished by the fact that no information can escape from within the event horizon .",
    "hence , any physical solution to ( [ de ] ) must be purely ingoing at the event horizon , that is , at @xmath27 ( @xmath77 ) . therefore we seek solutions to ( [ de ] ) of form ( for a given frequency @xmath78 ) @xmath79 where the amplitudes of the scattered and the transmitted waves , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , remain to be determined .",
    "clearly , problems involving waves scattered from a schwarzschild black hole share many features with scattering problems in quantum theory .",
    "hence , we can adopt standard techniques to evaluate @xmath80 and @xmath81 . by conservation of flux",
    "it follows that @xmath82 hence , we need only determine either @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "typical results for @xmath80 are shown in figure  [ scat ] .",
    "the nature of @xmath80 can be understood from the following observations . for @xmath83",
    "the wavelength of the infalling wave is so large that the wave is essentially unaffected by the presence of the black hole .",
    "it is only if we `` aim '' the wave straight at the black hole ( recall that the impact parameter follows from @xmath84 ) that we can get an appreciable effect .",
    "hence , we expect to have @xmath85 as @xmath86 . for large frequencies @xmath87 , the situation is the opposite and we expect to find that @xmath88 as @xmath89 . thus , high frequency waves will be absorbed unless they are aimed away from the black hole .          in studies of dynamical black holes",
    "one often needs to construct the general solution to ( [ de ] ) .",
    "one can do this using two linearly independent solutions .",
    "these are customarily normalised in a way that differs slightly from ( [ bc1 ] ) .",
    "a first solution ( essentially ( [ bc1 ] ) ) is such that the amplitude of the waves falling across the event horizon are normalised to unity , and one requires the amplitudes of out- and ingoing waves at infinity .",
    "this solution is sometimes called the `` in''-mode and it can be written @xmath90 given this solution , a second linearly independent one corresponds to waves of unit amplitude reaching spatial infinity . this is the `` up '' mode , and it follows from @xmath91 the nature of these two solutions is illustrated in figure  [ inup ] .",
    "for those unfamiliar with conformal diagrams , a short explanation of figure  [ inup ] is necessary . suppressing the angular coordinates @xmath92",
    ", we make a coordinate transformation in @xmath93 such that the half - infinite space exterior to the black hole is mapped onto a finite portion of the plane .",
    "the transformation is chosen so that the light cones always intersect at an angle of 45@xmath94 much like mercator s projection of the earth distorts the shape of the continents but preserves the directions north - south and east - west .",
    "the four ` points at infinity ' are mapped into the diagonal edges as follows :          one can analyse the scattering of monochromatic waves by a kerr black hole in much the same way as we approached the schwarzschild case .",
    "the same is true also for wave fields other than scalar waves .",
    "the analysis of electromagnetic and gravitational wave scattering is , in principle , identical to that for scalar waves .",
    "however , in the case of gravitational waves an additional complication enters : gravitational waves come with two different polarisations .",
    "this means that the scattering amplitude consists of a sum of their individual contributions , and that the cross section may show features due to interference between these two contributing terms .",
    "this effect has not been explored in detail as yet .",
    "similarly , despite a few studies , the full details of scattering from rotating black holes remain to be understood . scattering of gravitational waves incident along the axis of symmetry of a kerr black hole show that the scattering cross section depends in a complicated way on the rotation parameter @xmath95 .",
    "one would essentially expect kerr scattering to be different because of two effects that do not exist for nonrotating holes : superradiance and the polarization of the incident wave .",
    "for incidence along the symmetry axis of a rotating black hole one can have either co- or counter - rotating waves .",
    "the two cases lead to quite different results .",
    "although the general features of the corresponding cross sections are similar they show different structure in the backward direction .",
    "this possibly arises because of the phase - difference between the two polarisations of gravitational waves . as for superradiance",
    ", it has been suggested that it tends to wash out interference minima .",
    "further details can be found in the book by futterman , handler and matzner  @xcite ."
