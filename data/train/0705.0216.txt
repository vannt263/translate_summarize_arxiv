    "much attention has been given to semiconductor spintronics both theoretically and experimentally due to great prospect of the potential applications.@xcite the study of the spin relaxation / dephasing ( r / d ) in semiconductors contains rich physics and is of great importance for the device application .",
    "three spin r / d mechanisms have long been proposed in zinc - blend semiconductors , i.e. , the elliott - yafet ( ey ) mechanism,@xcite caused by the spin - flip electron - impurity scattering due to the spin - orbit coupling ; the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism@xcite which is due to the momentum - dependent spin splitting in crystal without a center of symmetry ; and the bir - aronov - pikus ( bap ) mechanism@xcite which originates from the spin - flip electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "previous researches have shown that , in bulk systems , the ey mechanism is important in narrow - band - gap and high impurity semiconductors ; the dp mechanism is dominant in @xmath1-type semiconductors ; and the bap mechanism can have significant effect in @xmath0-doped semiconductors.@xcite it is known that , in heavily @xmath0-doped bulk samples , the bap mechanism is dominant at low temperature whereas the dp mechanism is dominant at high temperature with the crossover temperature determined by the doping level . in bulk samples with low hole density , the bap mechanism has been shown to be irrelevant.@xcite in addition , the hyperfine interaction induced spin relaxation is another possible mechanism.@xcite    in contrast to the bulk systems , the relative importance of the bap and dp mechanisms for the electron spin r / d in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems , especially in @xmath0-type 2d systems , is still not very clear , sometimes even confusing . in ref .  [ ] , extremely long spin relaxation time ( srt ) , which is two orders of magnitude longer than that in the bulk sample with corresponding acceptor concentrations , was reported by wagner _ et al . _ in @xmath0-type gaas quantum wells ( qws ) .",
    "the authors argued that the bap mechanism is dominant at low temperature .",
    "however in ref .",
    "[ ] , the srt in @xmath0-type qws was reported to be a factor of 4 shorter than that in comparably bulk gaas by damen _",
    "et al . _ at low temperature .",
    "the authors also referred the bap mechanism as a cause for the decrease of the srt .",
    "hence , two opposite experimental results arrive at the same conclusions regarding the importance of the bap mechanism . moreover , gotoh _ et al .",
    "_ further pointed out that the bap mechanism should not be ignored even at room temperature.@xcite they investigated the electric field dependence of srt and found that the srt decreases with the increase of the bias .",
    "they concluded that the decrease is from the bap mechanism as the srt due to the dp mechanism does not change with electric field .",
    "actually , they overlooked the fact that the rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite can also lead to the spin r / d due to the dp mechanism .",
    "therefore , we believe that the decrease of srt in their experiment can not be a proof of the importance of the bap mechanism . very recently it was shown that the srt at room temperature can be increased at the @xmath2 gaas surface due to the relatively lower concentration of holes at the surface and the mechanism for the srt was referred to as the bap mechanism.@xcite theoretically , maialle@xcite pointed out that the effect of the bap mechanism in 2d systems is a little smaller than that of the dp mechanism at zero temperature by using the fermi golden rule to calculate the srt in which the elastic scattering approximation was applied and consequently the nonlinear terms of the electron - hole coulomb scattering were neglected .",
    "the srt due to the dp mechanism ( @xmath3 ) was also calculated by using the single particle approach.@xcite the author compared @xmath3 and @xmath4 for different electron momentums ( kinetic energies ) , and showed that these two srts have nearly the same order of magnitude in heavily doped qws .",
    "however , @xmath3 calculated in refs.is quite cursory , because , under the framework of single particle theory the carrier - carrier coulomb scattering , which is very important to spin r / d,@xcite is not included .",
    "also the counter effect of the scattering to the spin r / d is also not fully accounted.@xcite moreover , it is also important to calculate the spin - flip electron - hole exchange scattering explicitly in order to find out the effect of the nonlinear terms ignored in the fermi golden rule approach by maialle _",
    "et al._@xcite we also want to find out the temperature dependence of the relative importance of both mechanisms in 2d systems , which to the best of our knowledge is still absent in the literature ..    in order to accurately investigate the relative importance of the dp and the bap mechanisms beyond the single - particle fermi golden rule approach , we use the fully microscopic approach established by wu _",
    "et al._@xcite by constructing and numerically solving the kinetic spin bloch equations.@xcite in this approach , all the corresponding scatterings such as the electron - acoustic ( ac ) phonon , electron - longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonon , electron - nonmagnetic impurity , and electron - electron coulomb scatterings are explicitly included .",
    "the results / predictions obtained from this approach are in very good agreement with varies experiments.@xcite it was previously pointed out that , in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening , any type of scattering , including the coulomb scattering , can give rise to the spin r / d.@xcite in this paper , in addition to the all the above mentioned scatterings in @xmath1-type qws as considered in ref .",

    "it is very different from the bulk systems in which the bap mechanism is absolutely dominant at low temperature .",

    "<S> we study the electron spin relaxation in intrinsic and @xmath0-type ( 001 ) gaas quantum wells by constructing and numerically solving the kinetic spin bloch equations . </S>",
    "<S> all the relevant scatterings are explicitly included , especially the spin - flip electron - heavy hole exchange scattering which leads to the bir - aronov - pikus spin relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , due to the neglection of the nonlinear terms in the electron - heavy hole exchange scattering in the fermi - golden - rule approach , the spin relaxation due to the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism is greatly exaggerated at moderately high electron density and low temperature in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the spin relaxation time due to the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism with that due to the dyakonov - perel mechanism which is also calculated from the kinetic spin bloch equations with all the scatterings , especially the spin - conserving electron - electron and electron - heavy hole scatterings , included . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in intrinsic quantum wells , the effect from the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism is much smaller than that from the dyakonov - perel mechanism at low temperature , and it is smaller by no more than one order of magnitude at high temperature . in @xmath0-type quantum wells , the spin relaxation due to the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism is also much smaller than the one due to the dyakonov - perel mechanism at low temperature and becomes comparable to each other at higher temperature when the hole density and the width of the quantum well are large enough . </S>",
    "<S> we claim that unlike in the bulk samples , the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism hardly dominates the spin relaxation in two - dimensional samples . </S>"
