    "the gray - scott model @xcite is a widely - studied model of a pair of reactions involving cubic autocatalysis .",
    "it has been applied in reaction - diffusion models in one @xcite , two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions .",
    "widely - known results include the existence of stable single spots , self - replication of spots , spontaneous formation of stripes and hexagonal arrays of spots , and turing patterns @xcite .",
    "findings that show a lack of moving stable patterns , e.g. @xcite apply only in 1-d or a limited region of the 2-d system parameter space ( @xcite p. 81 and",
    "@xcite p. 3 ) .",
    "@xcite shows existence of stable multi - spot patterns within a finite domain .",
    "the model equations are : @xmath1    this paper concerns the two - dimensional case with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "i use similar terminology and symbols to those in @xcite : @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the concentrations of two reactants @xmath4 and @xmath5 , normalized to dimensionless units .",
    "parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the feed rate and removal rate of the reactants in the original homogeneous continuously - stirred tank reactor model ; in diffusion systems they are typically the rates at which @xmath4 and @xmath5 permeate through a membrane separating a homogeneous supply from the gel in which the patterned reactions occur @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the diffusion rates of the two reactants through the gel or other medium ; considered together as a ratio @xmath10 , they constitute a third parameter that determines certain characteristics of the parameter space @xcite . in this paper , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . since i am measuring the size , velocity , and other related statistics of certain features in observed patterns",
    ", there is a need for time and length units . for this purpose",
    "i use the dimensionless units of length and time implicit in the equations , and refer to them as / ( `` length unit '' ) and / ( `` time unit '' ) respectively .",
    "i used numerical simulation similar to that of pearson @xcite ( discrete euler forward integration , also called forward - time centered - space @xcite ) .",
    "all figures shown here were produced with a @xmath13 grid , with @xmath14 representing a system size of @xmath15 , periodic boundary conditions , and @xmath16 .",
    "results were verified using higher grid resolution , smaller time steps , and 2^nd^ and 4^th^ order runge - kutta integration . because many of these patterns exhibit novel properties ( such as stability combined with motion ) it was necessary to perform a thorough series of measurements to isolate the legitimate `` real '' phenomena from any effects that arise from simulation error .    in these tests ,",
    "the grid resolution @xmath17 , time step @xmath18 , and stability index @xmath19 ( the variable component of the courant condition , see @xcite ) were each decreased in steps of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the finest resolution used was @xmath22 with double - precision arithmetic .    ' '' ''",
    ".measurements of the velocities of the two moving patterns in figure  [ fig : pi - valu ] , performed with progressively increasing grid and time resolutions .",
    "all tests were performed in ieee double precision ; @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and gridsize @xmath25 or larger .",
    "procedure for velocities : 1 .",
    "wait for moving pattern to assume its steady - state appearance .",
    "2 . locate a grid point on the centerline of the moving feature and on its leading edge , where @xmath26 is high and @xmath2 is close to 0.42 ; note its location and the elapsed system time ( in / and / respectively ) .",
    "3 . wait for the pattern to travel at least @xmath27 .",
    "4 . measure again , compute @xmath28 .",
    "measurement error is 1 part in 200 .",

    "2 . at periodic intervals ,",
    "compute sum of all @xmath2 values in the grid .",
    "3 . examine the @xmath2 sums to identify its asymptotic behavior : a stable moving approaches a finite asymptote and continues moving ; unstable patterns stop moving or grow without bound .",
    "4 . repeat for a new @xmath7 value ; continue until the range of valid @xmath7 values is known to the desired precision .",
    "@xmath29 = did not test .",
    "[ tab : accuracy ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these tests showed no qualitative difference in the results , but did enable more accurate determination of certain measurements .",
    "for example , the `` measured velocities '' in tables 1 and 2 have a measurement error of 1 part in 200 due to the procedure used , and the increases in @xmath17 and @xmath18 resolution had no significant effect on the measured velocities : but the double - precision tests show a somewhat greater consistency ( i.e. lower variance ) in the same measurement across different grid resolutions .",
    "all phenomena reported in the remainder of this paper appear at the grid resolutions of @xcite , @xmath30 , with single - precision arithmetic .",
    "a few grid effects are apparent at this lower resolution , for example the two - spot pattern in figure  [ fig : pi - valu ] reorients to a diagonal alignment .",
    "such effects diminish sharply at higher grid resolutions .",
    "the initial state was created in several ways .",
    "most results were produced by starting with a background level of @xmath2 and @xmath3 set to a homogeneous state computed from @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "there is always a stable state @xmath31 , sometimes called the `` red state '' @xcite . for @xmath32",
    "sufficiently small there are two other homogeneous states , one of which can be stable ( called the `` blue state '' , due to the color of the ph indicator bromothymol blue the laboratory experiments of @xcite ) . transforming the variables and units from muratov and osipov@xcite ,",
    "the third homogeneous state @xmath33 exists when @xmath34 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "starting with a grid filled with these values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 or with @xmath38 , a number of rectangles were added whose width , height , locations , and number were determined randomly , and then filled with random levels of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for most tests , these rectangles ranged from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in area , and the frequency of occurrence of any given size rectangle was inversely proportional to its area .",
    "density of these rectangles ranged anywhere from 1 to 40 per @xmath41 .",
    "a typical example is shown in figure  [ fig : uskate - generation ] .",
    "0.2 . in the first image",
    ", each rectangle has a randomly chosen @xmath2 and @xmath3 between 0 and 1 , and the background is @xmath42 .",

    "the exaggerated contrast makes many @xmath2 values completely black or white .",

    "[ fig : uskate - generation ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    a repeatable pseudo - random algorithm was used to generate all starting patterns , and the initial seed values saved so the same simulation sequence could be reproduced at will @xcite .",
    "the simulation was run for anywhere from @xmath43 to @xmath44 / , as needed for the phenomena under test . a complete survey of the parameter space in figure  [ fig : param - space ]",
    "was performed at intervals of 0.02 in @xmath7 and 0.04 in @xmath6 ; many starting patterns were tried at each parameter value combination .",
    "the interested reader can find a gallery of images online at @xcite .",
    "although all of the patterns shown here arose naturally from such initial random states , a number of techniques were used to make exploration and discovery more practical : selectively removing unwanted patterns by setting portions of the grid to the homogeneous state ; combining parts of patterns to create others ; changing parameter values ; moving small parts of the grid to test pattern integrity ; then continuing the simulation after making any of these changes .",
    "because of their stability , each type @xmath45 pattern naturally evolves from any starting pattern that superficially resembles it , provided the dimensions and levels of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are approximately correct .",
    "i found it exceptionally useful to visualize @xmath2 and @xmath46 simultaneously via appropriate color mappings , with the latter greatly amplified as in figure  [ fig : pi - deriv ] .",
    "an interactive simulation tool was essential for the discovery of stable moving patterns `` in the wild '' .",
    "most work was performed on an 8-core xeon workstation ; verification tests were also performed on a powerpc workstation .",
    "the simulation was implemented in c , divided into anywhere from 2 to 16 execution threads via pthreads .",
    "the data set was partitioned in one dimension only ( stripes , each overlapping by two rows with the two neighbor stripes ) ; all inter - thread data exchange was via shared memory .",
    "additional insight was gained from 1-d and 3-d numerical simulations ( the latter from the website at @xcite ) .",
    "i noted all of the pattern types reported in pearson @xcite , including several parameter values at which two or more of pearson s types coexist ; many examples are exhibited at @xcite .",
    "in addition i observed three new pattern types , illustrated in figure  [ fig : types - nx ] and named @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath45 to extend pearson s classification letters .",
    "type @xmath47 is found throughout a large part of the area labeled / in @xcite , bordering on the regions @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "here we have stable spots ( called solitons or autosolitons by others @xcite ) that do not multiply .",
    "these spots are static only in isolation .",
    "pairs and groups drift apart from one another , at a rate that diminishes sharply with distance .",
    "the velocity of two spots drifting apart in a sufficiently large and otherwise empty domain is modeled fairly well by an exponentially decaying rate : velocity @xmath52 where @xmath53 is inter - spot distance , @xmath54 and @xmath55 constant . for @xmath56 as shown here , @xmath57 : the spots drift about half as fast with every added @xmath58 of inter - spot distance . @xmath55 increases with @xmath7 and with @xmath6 ; for example , at @xmath59 , @xmath60 ; and at @xmath61 , @xmath62 . given enough time and a small domain size , motion ceases with spots roughly equidistant ; such multi - spot patterns are the subject of @xcite . at lower @xmath6 values , particularly for @xmath63 , spot - like starting patterns produce spots that oscillate with a characteristic frequency varying slightly with @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and a damping rate that diminishes sharply as @xmath32 approaches the right edge of the type @xmath47 region in figure  [ fig : param - space ] . near this frontier",
    "the stable spot becomes smaller in diameter and the central peak has @xmath64 farther from @xmath65 .",
    "also in figure  [ fig : param - space ] we see that at higher @xmath6 values type @xmath47 occurs on both sides of the saddle - node bifurcation line . as mazin et .",
    "al . found in one dimension @xcite , at higher @xmath6 values the red state overpowers the blue state in a substantial band to the left of the saddle - node line ; however it is not strong enough to extinguish small spots .",
    "for this reason , parameters in this band support solitons that do not grow to fill the space with the blue state .",
    "type @xmath48 is found in a modest - sized area of the parameter space which includes @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : param - space ] , type @xmath48 appears on both sides of the saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "it also appears on both sides of the subcritical / supercritical boundary at @xmath68 ( when @xmath69 , the model without diffusion oscillates indefinitely ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "type @xmath48 patterns very closely resemble the b - z ( belousov - zhabotinsky ) reaction in a petri dish .",
    "an initial pattern containing a traveling wave front with free ends produces two spiral seeds and usually results in sustained activity . at some parameter values",
    "the waves develop flaws similar to the segmented waves shown in @xcite ( which is discussing a cdima system ) ; these flaws contribute to the production of more spiral seeds .",
    "occasionally , double spirals also occur .",
    "a self - sustaining population of spiral seeds is needed to maintain the pattern , and the density of seeds varies with @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "the longevity of the pattern is highly dependent on the size of the domain . at @xmath70 , twenty starting patterns like that in figure  [ fig : uskate - generation ] ( a @xmath71 domain ) had an average life - span of 5400 / before all waves died out .",
    "twenty trials in a @xmath72 domain with starting patterns of the same density all lasted longer than @xmath73 /.",

    "at all @xmath6 values the @xmath45 band is very narrow in @xmath7 as compared to its distance from the bifurcation lines .",
    "for example , when @xmath87 , the saddle - node bifurcation is at @xmath88 , the hopf bifurcation is at @xmath89 , the turing bifurcation is at @xmath90 , and the range of valid @xmath7 values for the object in the lower - left of figure  [ fig : pi - valu ] is @xmath91 .",
    "thus the width of the @xmath45 band near @xmath87 is about @xmath92 in units of @xmath7 , while the distance to the nearby turing region is ten times as great .",

    "contrast has been exaggerated in the area of @xmath82 to show the concentric rings or `` halos '' that surround all patterns in systems with these parameters .",
    "the halos are concentric stationary waves of alternating sign superimposed on the homogeneous state values @xmath95 in .",
    "the full range of @xmath2 and @xmath3 levels for type @xmath45 patterns at @xmath96 is @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the other two patterns in figure [ fig : pi - valu ] move to the left , indefinitely at constant speed ; the three - spot pattern moves at about 1 / per @xmath99 , and the -shaped pattern at about 1 / per @xmath100 .",
    "all of the patterns in [ fig : pi - valu ] arise frequently from random starting patterns , and are resilient to noise and other perturbations .",
    "if any of them is perturbed by shifting half of the pattern in any direction a distance on the order of 0.02 / , further simulation results in a return to the canonical forms shown here .",

    "the motion of the two patterns in the bottom half of the figure is clear .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotate ] shows two rotating patterns .",
    "both rotate clockwise ; the four - spot pattern performs one full revolution in about @xmath101 ; the other takes about @xmath102 .",
    "disruptions to these will cause a momentary change in rotational velocity followed by a return to the normal rotation rate after the spots return to the stable alignment .",
    "many stripelike patterns like those in figure  [ fig : stripes ] arise from random starting patterns ; one - ended forms are more common than the two - ended versions shown here .",
    "they are stable in the central linear section , in the direction perpendicular to their length , but are unstable in the other dimension .",
    "any deviation from a straight line will increase , first slowly and then with increasing speed , forming meanders like those of a river in a floodplain .",
    "these linear forms grow at both ends .",
    "the top one is the fastest , each end grows at about 1 / per @xmath103 , slightly slower than the speed of the -shaped pattern in figure  [ fig : pi - valu ] .",
    "the second example grows at 1 / per @xmath104 from each end .",
    "the third example has two spots at each end that make it grow ( at about 1 / per @xmath105 ) ; without these spots the pattern shrinks at each end .",
    "when encountering other objects , these stripelike patterns will change direction , stop growing , or ( frequently in the case of the topmost example ) break down into some other form , such as separate parallel stripes .",
    "systems that contain active growing stripes will usually grow to fill all available space with spots and stripes , but the time taken and the final proportion of spots to stripes is highly variable , and depends on tiny details of the initial configuration .",
    "this is substantially different from the behavior of stripes at other parameter values in the gray - scott system , whose final density can generally be predicted from the parameter values alone .",

    "( see also the introductory section of @xcite ) turing patterns arise spontaneously from random noise of arbitrarily low initial amplitude , diffusion plays an active role in the destabilization of the initial state , and a characteristic wavelength ( spot size and/or stripe width ) exists that is independent of the system size .",
    "figure  [ fig : turing - k6200 ] shows a typical turing pattern in the 2-d gray - scott system ; it was produced from a starting pattern of `` white '' noise with amplitude @xmath122 superimposed on the blue state @xmath95 from .",

    "this is typical of patterns throughout the turing domain , which at @xmath87 includes @xmath7 values in the range @xmath123 ( see @xcite for a derivation of the formulas for these values ; @xmath124 is the hopf bifurcation ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : expan-6058 ] and [ fig : expan-6115 ] show two frames of a simulation in which @xmath7 was gradually increased from 0.06058 to 0.06110 over @xmath125 .",
    "the overall length of the horizontal row of spots increases with @xmath7 , and the smaller 3-spot pattern moves slightly away from it .",
    "the entire set of 15 spots also rotates very slowly as a unit .",
    "similar interactions between patterns that are not in direct contact are very common .",

    "for certain parameter values they found that the spots interact in a similar way to that described in this paper ; they showed some stable multi - spot arrangements similar to my figure  [ fig : pi - valu ] and proposed several more .",
    "there are some differences , for example the pattern in their figure 5(e ) ( a four - spot pattern in a configuration with unequal angles ) is not stable in the gray - scott system with parameters @xmath126 , nor at several other locations i tested throughout the @xmath45 region .",
    "i also found the pattern in their figure 5(b ) ( three spots in a straight line ) to be stable , whereas they did not .",
    "such differences might result from differences in the spacing and relative amplitudes of the halos .    in work related to @xcite , a number of researchers including purwins et .",
    "@xcite have identified and studied `` quasi - particles '' that can arrange themselves in a very similar manner to my figures [ fig : pi - valu ] and [ fig : hex - k6150 ] .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figures 3 ( d ) , ( g ) , and ( h ) of the web page article by stollenwerk @xcite .",
    "note in particular the halos around the spots in their figure 3(d ) .",
    "these spots arose in laboratory ac gas plasma discharge experiments that have other features reminiscent of patterns seen in the two - dimensional gray - scott system .",
    "liehr , et .",
    "al . in @xcite , modeling a dc gas plasma discharge experiment , began with a 3-component reaction - diffusion system , then transformed the equations into a two - component form with a global integration term .",
    "in numerical simulation ( see their figures 3 and 5 ) they achieved results similar to my figures [ fig : hex - k6135 ] and [ fig : hex - k6150 ] . note the halos and arrangement of the spots in their patterns . studying a similar 3-component system ,",
    "schenk in @xcite shows several examples that include a _ zielscheiben - struktur _ ( target structure ) closely resembling the target patterns in my figure  [ fig : exotic ] .",
    "spots with halos and similar spot - to - spot interactions are also shown in that work . in both of these 3-component systems",
    ", a single spot can have an intrinsic velocity and display particle - like collision behavior in addition to the static attraction and repulsion effects .",
    "the single spot in the upper - left of figure  [ fig : pi - valu ] has a set of concentric halos with progressively lower amplitude and alternating sign . in multi - spot patterns",
    ", each spot tends to be found at a location that coincides with the first positive - sign halos of neighboring spots . in the growth of hexagonal arrays",
    ", the new spots always appear at such locations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pi - valu ] , the -shaped moving pattern is of similar size and shape to the three - spot pattern , and both tend to return to the canonical dimensions shown here after distortion or perturbation .    in more distant alignments such as that in figure  [ fig : expan-6058 ] the spots are found at distances coinciding with each other s second positive - signed surrounding halos .",
    "this is also evident in the five - spot pattern in figure  [ fig : hex - k6090 ] , which remains as shown when perturbed , rather than changing to a pentagonal ring or some other arrangement .    in several instances ( for example figure  [ fig : stripes ] , all of figure  [ fig : spacing ] , and figure  [ fig : targ-2x3 ] ) we see rows of spots and other roughly linear features , halos that parallel these features , and motion and interaction that follows the locations of these roughly linear halos .",
    "all of the foregoing suggest that areas of high @xmath2 and low @xmath3 produce a pattern of surrounding standing waves , and that these standing waves combine in a nearly linear way to produce an effect of constructive and destructive interference , causing spots and other features to drift towards a preferred alignment .",
    "a similar explanation exists for spot interactions in the reaction - diffusion system of @xcite .",
    "analytical research is needed to establish a basis for this theory for the gray - scott model equations , or another explanation that can account for the observed phenomena .",
    "inasmuch as similar effects are observed in the 1-dimensional system ( see mazin et .",
    "al @xcite and my own work @xcite ) , analytical work can probably begin with 1-dimensional systems .",
    "there is much opportunity for further research by numerical simulation , including rigorous statistical analysis to establish the degree of stability of the patterns in response to varying types and levels of perturbation .",
    "the majority of the present results are at a single point in the parameter space ; there is a likelihood that changing @xmath6 and @xmath127 will yield new discoveries .",
    "the superficial similarity ( spot shape and `` halos '' and target patterns ) and behavior ( spots condensing into a bound multi - spot state similar to `` molecules '' ) in gas plasma experiments , combined with the successful modeling ( e.g. by @xcite ) of these experiments by a reaction - diffusion system in numerical simulation , strongly suggest research to identify more connections between the present work and the gas discharge systems .",
    "concerning the moving stable structures , there are several well - studied reaction - diffusion system models , including the brusselator model with diffusion , the three - component system of @xcite , and the oregonator model of the b - z reaction @xcite ; all sharing many or most of the features of the gray - scott system ( stripes , spots , multiple homogeneous stable states , mixed - mode patterns , ability to produce turing patterns , and varying types of movement and interaction at various parameter values ) . because of these many shared traits , it seems likely that some of these other systems can also produce stable moving localized patterns and other complex phenomena like those described in the present paper .",
    "if such phenomena exist , they likely involve parameter values that have not been thoroughly explored , or may be confined to a very narrow region of the parameter space .",
    "finally , this author notes that the great diversity of patterns and types of interaction displayed by the gray - scott system at these specific parameter values , combined with the inherent stability of these patterns , clearly places this system in wolfram s class 4 ( complex localized structures , sometimes long - lived ) @xcite that characterizes certain discrete cellular automata that have been shown to be capable of universal computation .",
    "constructing large systems of interacting patterns presents several challenges for long - term stability , because most interactions cause each interacting part to shift .",
    "however , a starting pattern containing an infinite array of elements , each of which is only used a small number of times , would appear promising .",
